<a href='/results.php?city=worcester' rel='city origin'>Worcester</a> <a rel="month origin" value="10">October</a> <a rel='day origin' value='12'>12th</a>. [I believe] 1755. 

Dear Sir, — All that part of Creation that lies within our observation is liable to change. Even mighty 
States and Kingdoms are not exempted. If we look into History, we shall find some Nations rising from 
contemptible beginnings and spreading their Influence, till the whole Globe is subjected to their sway. When 
they have reached the summit of Grandeur, some minute and unsuspected cause, commonly effects their ruin, and the empire of the world is transferred to some 
other Place. Immortal Rome was at first but an insignificant village, inhabited only by a few abandoned RufHans, but by degrees it rose to a stupendous height 
and excelled in Arts and Arms all the Nations that preceded it. But the demolition of Carthage, [what one should think would have established it in supream 
Dominion] by removing all danger, suffered it to sink into Debauchery and made it at length an easy prey to Barbarians. England immediately upon this, began to 
increase, [the particular and minute causes of which I am not Historian enough to trace], in Power and Magnificence, and is now the greatest Nation upon 
the Globe. Soon after the Reformation, a few People came over into this new world for conscience sake. Perhaps this, apparently, trivial incident may transfer 
the great seat of empire into America. It looks likely to me. For if we can remove the turbulent Gallicks, our People according to the exactest Computations, 
will in another Century, become more numerous than England itself Should this be the Case, since we have I may say, all the Naval Stores of the Nation in our 
hands it will be easy to obtain the Mastery of the seas, and then the united force of all Europe will not be able 
to subdue us. The only way to keep us from setting up for ourselves is to disunite us. Divide et impera. Keep us in distant colonies, and then some great Men 
in each Colony, desiring the Monarchy of the whole, they will destroy each others influence, and keep the Country in equilibrio. 

Be not surprised that I am turned Politician. This 
whole Town is immersed in Politicks. The Interests 
of Nations and all the Dira of War, make the subject 
of every conversation. I sit and hear. And after 
having been led through a maze, of sage observations 
I sometimes retire, and by laying things together, form 
some reflections pleasing to myself. The Produce of 
one of these Reveries, you have read above. Different 
employment and different objects, may have drawn your 
Thought other Ways. I shall think myself happy, if in 
your turn you communicate your Lucubrations to me. 
I wrote you sometime since, and have waited with impatience for an answer, but have been disappointed. 
I hope that Lady at Barnstable has not made you 
forget your Friends. Friendship, I take it, is one of 
the distinguishing Glories of Man. And the Creature 
that is insensible of its Charms, tho* he may wear the 
shape of Man, is unworthy of the Character. In this 
perhaps we bear a nearer resemblance of embodied 
Intelligences, than any thing else. From this I expect 
to receive the chief Happiness of my future Life ; and 
am sorry that Fortune has thrown me at such a distance 
from those of my Friends who have the highest Place 
in my affections. But thus it is, and I must submit. 
But I hope, e'er long, to return and live in that happy 
familiarity that has from earliest Infancy subsisted 
between yourself and affectionate Friend

Addressed to Mr. Nathan Webb at <a href='/results.php?city=braintree' rel='city'>Braintree</a>. 

[The following is appended as a foot-note to the 
above letter dated Worcester, October 12, 1755.] 

<a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a> <a rel="month origin" value="4">April</a> 	<a rel='day origin' value='22'>22</a>. <a href='/results.php?year=1807' rel="origin">1807</a>. 

Nathan Webb was the son of the late Deacon Jonathan Webb of <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>and the Grandson of Benjamin Webb of the same Place. The Father and Grandfather 
were intimate Friends of my Father and Grandfather, 
and the son was my Playfellow at the Grammar School 
in <a href='/results.php?city=braintree' rel='city'>Braintree</a> and my Contemporary at Colledge. He 
had Wit, humour and good Nature equal to his understanding and Judgment which were very good. He 
died young and I attended him in his last sickness with 
equal Grief and assiduity and watched with him the 
night or two before his death. He left this letter and 
some others in Possession of his Father who left it 
with his whole Estate to his Nephew, Captain Jonathan 
Webb now of this Town living in the old seat of the 
Family, who about a fortnight ago was kind enough to 
send it to me, after it had lain fifty one years and an half 
among the Papers of the Family, in oblivion. It was 
written soon after I took my first degree at Colledge, 
and some days before I was twenty years old. Nathan 
was named after his uncle Nathan Webb the Minister 
of Uxbridge who married my Fathers Sister.

Dear Sir, — Yours of the 5th. came to me the 8th. 
You will see by the post, that the River is past and the 
bridge cut away. The Declaration was yesterday published and proclaimed from that awefuU stage in the 
State House Yard ; by whom do you think ? by the 
committee of safety, the committee of inspection, and 
a great crowd of people. 

Three cheers rended the Welkin, The Battallion 
paraded the common, and gave a Feu de Joy notwithstanding the scarcity of powder. The bells rung all 
day, and almost all night. Even the chimers chimed 
away. The Election for the city was carried on amidst 
all this hurry with the utmost decency and order. Who 
are chosen I cannot say, but the List was Franklin, 
Writtenhouse, Owen Biddle, Cannon, Schlosser, Matlock and KhuU. Thus you see the effect of Men of 
fortune, acting against the sense of the People. 

As soon as an American seal is prepared I conjecture 
the Declaration will be subscribed by all the members ; 
which will give you the opportunity you wished for, of 
transmitting your name among the votaries of Independence. 

I agree with you that we can never again be happy 
under a single particle of British power ; indeed this 
sentiment is universal.

My dear Sir, — Two Days ago, I was favoured with 
your polite and elegant Letter of January 22. I have 
reed, so many of your Letters within a few Months, 
containing such important matter, in so masterly a 
style, that I am ashamed to confess I have answered 
but one of them, and that only with a few Lines. I beg 
you would not impute this omission to inattention, 
Negligence, or want of Regard, but to its true Cause 
a Confusion of Business. I beg leave to assure you 
that I hold your Correspondence inestimable, and will 
do every Thing in my Power to cultivate it. Whether 
I shall be able to render any valuable service to our 
Country in my new Capacity, or not, is to me very 
uncertain : all I can say with Confidence is, that whether 
in that, or any other, I will never knowingly do it any 
Injury. 

In spight of all the Reflections that are cast upon 
human Nature, and of all the Satyrs on Mankind, and 
especially on , I have ever found or thought that 

I found Honesty to be the best Policy, and it is as true 
now as it was 3000 years ago, that the honest Man is 
seldom forsaken. 

Your sentiment that we are but half taught in the 
great national Arts of Government and War, are I fear 
too just. And I fear that the subject which is at present 
most essentially connected with our Government and 
Warfare, I mean Money, is least understood of any. 
I fear the Regulation of Prices will produce ruin sooner 
than safety. It will starve the Army and the Country 
if enforced, or I am ignorant of every Principle of 
Commerce, Coin and Society. Barter will be the only Trade. You are daily looking out for some great military Character : Have you found none ? Let me intreat you, my Friend, to look back on the Course of 
this War, and especially through the last Campaign, 
and then tell me, whether many Countries of the 
World have ever furnished more, and greater examples 
of Fortitude, Valour and Skill, than our little States 
have produced. We dont attend enough to our Heroes, 
and are too indulgent to those of opposite Characters. 
Barten, Meigs, Green, Smith, Willett, Gansevoort, 
Harkemer, Starke, Arnold, Gates, and many, many 
others, have exhibited to our view, a series of actions, 
which all the exertions and skill of our enemies, have 
never equalled in the present Contest I dont mean 
by this to derogate from the main Army or its Commander. Brandywine and Germantown can witness 
both Bravery and Skill, tho unfortunate. The great 
Fault of our officers is, want of Dilligence and Patience. 
They dont want Bravery or Knowledge. Let them 
learn to attend to their Men, to their Cloaths, Diet, Air, 
Exercise, Medicines, Arms, Accoutrements, &amp;c., — ^in 
short let our officers learn to keep their in Health, 
and to keep them together at their Duty, not let 2500 
Men run away to guard Baggage Waggons through a 
Country where there could be no enemy, and I would 
answer for the Bravery of our Armies, for their Discipline and good Dispositions. If one may venture to 
prophecy I think you will see in another Campaign, 
still greater exertions of Heroism and Magnanimity. 

The Idea that any one Man alone can save us is too 
silly for any Body, but such weak Men as Duche, to 
harbour for a Moment. 

I am very glad you have not laid down your Commission, and I conjure you, by all the Tyes of Friendship to your Country, not to do it. Men who are 
sensible of the evils in the hospital Department are the 
most likely to point them out to others, and to suggest 
Remedies. Patience ! Patience ! Patience. The first, 
the last and the middle virtue of a Politician. 

The Lady you mention will not go abroad, a Thousand reasons are against it. It would be too much 
happiness for him, who is your sincere Friend and 
most humble servt. 

<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">John Adams</a>.



P.S. — Mrs. Adams presents her Compliments to Dr. 
Rush and thanks him for his kind notice of her, and 
assures him that she shall stand in need of his prescriptions of condolance, and should esteem it an honour to 
have them administered by his Hand, as she is certain 
from his skill and judgment in humane nature they 
would serve as restoratives to the pained Heart, and anxious mind 

of his humble servant 

Abigail Adams. 

Be so good sir as to present my regards to your Lady.

Dr. Sir, — I'd the Pleasure of a Letter from you, a 
few days be&amp;&gt;re I sailed from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, which I have never been able to answer. 

I think I find more to do here ; more Difficulty to do right and at the same Time give satisfaction, than I did, you know where. 

We suffer here extremely for want of Intelligence 
from America, as we did there, and as I fear you do 
still for want of it from Europe. We have very imperfect Information concerning the state of the Army 
especially its Health, which you used to have the goodness to inform me of sometimes. I hope it is better 
than it was heretofore. I should be very happy to hear 
from you as often as you can, and to know the state of 
the Hospital as well as Army in general, and every 
Thing that relates to Government or War. There is 
a periodical Pamphlet in French under the title of the 
Affairs D'Angleterre &amp; De L'Amerique, in which Intelligence and Letters from America are published, for 
the Information of the People in Europe. 

I have a strong curiosity to know the Artifices, and 
subterfuges, with wh. the Tories still keep alive each 
others Hopes. When England has not and cannot get 
an ally, and many Nations are preparing to league themselves against her ; when her Merchants are breaking, 
her Manufacturers starving, and they are obliged to 
take them into public pay, under the name of Militia, 
to prevent their Picking Pocketts, robbing on the Highways, and plundering in Companies all before them. 

I have but one Peace of advice to give. I never had 
any other. ** Be not deceived." Tho B. is in a 
deplorable situation, the administration will neither 
acknowledge our Independence nor withdraw their 
Troops. You must kill, starve or take them all. 

Your F'nd. &amp; seP'^'t.

My dear Friend, — I am indebted to you for more 
Letters than I can repay at present, but declaring myself a Bankrupt, you must accept of a few shillings in 
the Pound : indeed I suspect the Debt is greater than 
I know of, having seen in the Courier de L'Europe, 
part of a letter from you to Dr. Dubourg, which was 
intercepted, in which you refer him to me for a long 
Letter upon our military affairs, &amp;c. 

But this letter, nor any other from you, never reached 
me in France. I was sensibly afflicted at their Loss, for 
there are no Letters I prize more than yours, because 
none to me are more instructive, and in Europe I was 
terribly tormented for want of information from our 
Country. 

How goes on your Government ? When I arrived I 
found the Massachusetts, in sober earnest, endeavouring at last to frame a Constitution. The People have 
done themselves Honour, in choosing a great number 
of the most respectable Men, into the Convention, and 
there has been hitherto great Harmony among them. 
My native Town of <a href='/results.php?city=braintree' rel='city'>Braintree</a> did me the Honour to 
choose me into this society of Worthies, upon my first 
arrival, and although I foresee I shall have a laborious 
Piece of Business of it, yet I am much pleased with 
the opportunity of having a share in this great Work. 
It is impossible for us, however, to acquire any Honour 
as so many fine examples have been so recently set us ; 
although we shall deserve some degree of Disgrace if 
we fall much short of them. It will not be easy to 
please this People ; but I hope we shall succeed : if we 
do not, I dont know what will be the Consequence. 

We must send to Europe or the other States, for 
what I know, for a set of Legislators. My best 
Respects to your agreeable Family, and all our Friends 
in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and believe me to be your Friend and 
servant

Bra^NTRES <a rel="month origin" value="9">Septr.</a> <a rel='day origin' value='19'>19</a>. <a href='/results.php?year=1779' rel="origin">1779</a>. 

Dear Sir, — I had the Pleasure of yours of August 
19, by the last Post, and thank you for your kind Congratulations on my Return. You Judge right when you 
suppose that I cannot be idle, but my Industry will 
probably be directed in a different manner in future. 
My Principles are not in Fashion. I may be more usefull here, as you observe, than in the Cabinet of Louis 
the 16. But let me tell you that that Cabinet is of 
great Importance, and that there ought to be some 
body there, who knows somewhat of the affairs of 
America, as well as Europe, and who will take the 
Pains to think, and to advise that Cabinet, with all 
proper Delicacy, in certain Circumstances. I have little 
to say about the Time and manner of my being superceded. Let those reflect upon themselves who are 
disgraced by it, not I. Those who did it are alone disgraced by it. The Man who can Show a long series of 
disinterested services to his Country, cannot be disgraced even by his Country. If she attempts it she 
only brings a stain upon her own character and makes 
his glory the more illustrious. 

We have cause to congratulate ourselves upon the favourable appearance of af&amp;irs in Europe and America. 
There is not one symptom in Europe against us. Yet 
I must own to you, that I think France and Spain are 
yet to be convinced of the true Method of conducting 
this War. It is not by besieging Gibraltar, nor invading Ireland, in my humble opinion, but by sending 
a clear superiority of Naval Power into the American 
seas, by destroying or captivating the British Forces 
here, by sea and Land, by taking the West India Islands 
and destroying the British Trade, and by affording Convoys to Commerce between Europe and America, and 
between America and the French and Spanish Islands, 
that this War is to be brought to a speedy Conclusion, 
happy for us, and glorious as well as advantageous to 
our alUes. 

These were the objects of all my negotiations, and I 
dare hazard all upon the good Policy of them. I fear 
that these Ideas will now be forgotten : I cannot but 
wish that Congress would give positive Instructions to 
their Minister, nay that they would make a direct application themselves to their ally, to this Purpose. 

Mr. Gerry can shew you, in Confidence, some Papers 
upon the subject. 

I have a great Curiosity to know the History of the 
Political Proceedings, within and out of Doors, last 
Winter. I confess myself unable to comprehend it I 
am more puzzled at the Conduct of those who ought to 
have been my Friends than at any Thing else. However I have not Light enough to form a Judgment 

You speak French so perfecdy, and love good Men 
so much, that I wish you to be acquainted with the 
Chevalier De la Luzerne, and Mr. Marbois. Those 
Gendemen were making enquiry after a certain Letter, that you was very partial to. I enclose it to you and 
request you to give it them from me with my most 
affectionate and respectfuU Compliments. I am with 
much affection, your Friend &amp; servt.

My dear Sir, — Your favours of Octr. 12 and 19 are 
before me. I should not have left the first seven days 
unanswered, if it had not been for my new Trade of a 
Constitution monger. I inclose a Pamphlet as my 
apology. It is only a Report of a Committee, and 
will be greatly altered no doubt. If the Com' tee. had 
boldly made the Legislature consist of three Branches, 
I should have been better pleased. But I cannot enlarge upon this subject. 

I am pained in my inmost soul, at the unhappy affair 
at Coll Wilsens. I think there ought to be an article 
in the Declaration of Rights of every State, securing 
Freedom of Speech, Impartiality, and Independence at 
the Bar. There is nothing on which the Rights of 
every Member of Society more depend. There is no 
Man so bad, but he ought to have a fair Tryal, and an 
equal Chance to obtain the ablest Council, or the Advocate of his Choice, to see that he has fair Play, and the 
Benefit of Truth and Law. 

Dont be dismayed, you will yet find Liberty a charming substance. I wish I had Leonidas, cant you send 
it after me ? 

Thank you for your Congratulations on my new and most honourable appointment. If it is possible for 
Mortals to honour Mortals, I am honoured, — ^with an 
Honour, however, that makes me tremble. Pray help 
me, by corresponding constantly with me, and sending 
me all the Pamphlets, Journals, News, &amp;c., to a little 
success, as well as honour. 

Your Congratulations on the Count D'Estaings operations, are conceived in Terms flattering enough. I 
will please myself, with the Thought, untill the contrary 
appears that I had some share in bringing him here. 
If he only liberates Georgia and Rhode Island, which 
seems to be already done, it is a great success. 

Altho I go to make Peace, yet if the old Lady, Britania will not suffer me to do that, I will do all I can in 
Character, to sustain the War, and direct it in a sure 
Course. I must be prudent in this however, which I 
fear is not enough my Characteristick, but I flatter myself, I am rather growing in this Grace ; in this spirit I 
think, that altho we have had Provocations enough to 
excite the warmest Passions against Great Britain, yet 
it is our duty to silence all resentment in our deliberations about Peace, and attend only to our Interests, and 
our engagements with our allies. 

Nothing ever gives me so much Pleasure, as to hear 
of Harmony in Congress. Upon this depends our 
Union, Strength, Prosperity and Glory. If the late 
appointments give satisfaction I am happy, and if the 
Liberties and Independence of our Country are not 
safe in my Hands, you may swear it is for want of 
Brains^ not of Heart. The appointment of Mr. Dana 
could not be mended. He will go, and I shall be happy. 
You have given me Pain by your account of the Complaints against the Director. I am sorry, very sorr)^ ! 

What will you say, if I should turn your Thoughts 
from Politicks to Philosophy. What do you think of 
Dr. Franklins Theory of Colds ? He is fixed in the 
opinion that we never take Cold from the cold air, and 
wants the experiments of sanitarians tried over again. 
Suppose you should make a Statical Chair, and try, 
whether Perspiration is most copious in a warm bed, 
or stark naked in the open air. I assure you, these 
Branches of Physicks, come within the Circle of the 
Sciences of the Statesman, for an unlucky Cold [which 
I have been much subject to all my days] may stop him 
in his Career, and dash all his schemes ; and it is a poor 
excuse to say, he foresaw arid provided against every 
event, but his own sickness. 

My Partner, whose tender Health and numerous 

Family, will not permit her to make me as happy as 

Mr. Jay, joins with me in the kindest Compliments to 

you and Mrs. Rush. Adieu.

Dear Sir, — Yours of 13 July is reed. Your account 
of the Resurrection of the Spirit of 1775 &amp; 1776 is 
refreshing. The Ladies having undertaken to support 
American Independence, setdes the Point. Surely no 
Gentleman will ever dispute it, against so many of the 
fair. The ill bred Fellows of St. James's will continue 
to quarrell about it, but we knew long ago that they 
have no manners. If Mrs. Rush reproaches you with 
Lukewarmness, sure I am, there must be zeal enough, 
for it is impossible that you should be wanting in the 
necessary Proportion of that quality. Mr. Searle is 
intitled to every good office in my Power, from many 
considerations. Lloyds will afford but a sorry subscription this year to Lord Norths Loan for 1781. They 
are deeply taken in. May they soon hear of more 
respectable additions to the List of their Losses. 

My best Compliments to Mrs. Rush and desire her 
to move in the assemblies of the Ladies, that their 
Influence may be exerted to promote Privateering. 
This and Trade is the only way to lay the Foundation 
of a Navy, which alone can afford a solid Protection to 
every Part of their Country. If I could have my Will, 
there should not be the least obstruction to Navigation, 
Commerce or Privateering. Because I firmly believe 
that one sailer will do us more good than two soldiers. 
Keppell is thrown out at Windsor, Burke and Cruger 
at Bristol, and your Friend Lawbridge in the City: it is 
necessary in England for a Man to be an enemy to his 
Country in order to be popular. WJien this is the 
Case all is lost. I am

My dear Sir, — Mr. Peter Paulus, is seized with an 
enthusiasm to go to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, with his Journeymen. 
I should be much obliged to you, for any advice or 
Civility you may shew him. 

The Batavian Spirit is at last arroused, and has 
uttered its voice, with Majesty, for the souvereignty of 
the United States of America. The 19 of April, was 
the memorable day, when their High Mightinesses took 
the Resolution. You will see in the Gazettes, the Petitions and Maneuvres which ushered in this event with 
such solemnity, as to make it the most signal epocha 
in the History of a Century. We shall have in this 
Nation, if I am not infinitely mistaken, a faithfully an 
affectionate and most usefull ally. 

In order to be steady and persevering in my known 
Character for Vanity, which honour I have acquired 
since I came to Europe by the help of friends, I must 
tell you that Don Liano, the Spanish Minister has this 
Moment gone out of my appartment, after having said 
to me, " You have made sir, the grandest step that has 
ever yet been taken. It is you, who have filled this 
Nation with enthusiasm for your Cause and turned 
their Heads. It is a most important and a most decisive Measure, and it is due to you." 

Voila! a flow of diplomatick Rhetorick, enough to 
turn my Head, whether I have turned those of the 
Dutchmen or not.

28 Septr. The Analogy of Religion and of manners, 
are undoubtedly not less advantages in the Connection 
with Holland, than those of Commerce and Republicanism. 

The Influence of the Stadtholder and his Court, the 
Intrigues of the English, the weight of a numerous, 
-wealthy and powerfuU English Party, the secret and 
open Negotiations of Neutral Powers were not the 
only obstacles I had to encounter. Secret dark Insinuations against my Personal Character from a Quarter 
from whence they ought not to have come, embarrassed 
me more than all the rest. Patience and Perseverance, 
however, at last overcame them all. 

My first object was to hear the public voice and to 
discover the national sense. I had soon Information 
from a variet)' of sources, which satisfied me beyond a Doubt. I ventured to presume upon it, knowing a 
little of the Constitution of the Country. It is perhaps 
the only Country of much Consequence in Europe 
where I should have hazarded so much. The Course 
I took would by no means succeed any where else. 
The Advantages arising from it are i. A litde money 
for our able Financier. 2. The Prevention of a separate Peace. 3, Occupation for a considerable Squadron of the British Navy for a considerable Part of the 
Campaign. 4. A little less Dependence upon France. 

5. More zeal and Necessity in England for Peace. 

6. A litde more inclination in Spain to strike with us. 

7. More Disposition in the Neutral Powers to a share 
in our Commerce and Confidence, and to admit us into 
the Neutral Confederation. 8. More Consideration to 
our Ministers in every Court. 9. More Dignity to our 
Cause in the Eyes of all Nations. 

You have been a little too busy in your profession 

of late and are getting Money too fast for my Comfort. 

I have read the Speculations on a Navy with vast 

Pleasure. The Subject and the Author were enough 

to interest me if the execution had been less able. 

I am dear sir, yours 

J. Adams, 
Dr. Benjamin Rush.

Mv DEAR Sir, — Mr. Archibald Redford, the Bearer 
of this Letter has been introduced to me by Gentlemen 
who have been useful! to us in the Negotiation for 
Peace, so that I venture to give him this introduction 
to you. 

We have such a dead Calm in Europe as I never 
knew before. — All is stagnated. No Government in 
England and no News from America. 

I hope to have the Pleasure of seeing you once more, 
at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, within the year. But if the acceptance 
of my resignation arrives as I expect in the first ships, 
I shall go to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> first and take a Dose of Repose, 
being very weary. 

With much esteem sir, your most 

obedient servant

My dear Friend, — Give me leave to introduce to 
your acquaintance and Friendship Mr. Thaxter, who 
goes home with the definitive Treaty. 

This Treaty which is but a Repetition of the Provisional Articles was all we could obtain, a poor Compensation for nine Months Negotiation ; but I assure you 
we were very glad to get the Hand put to this. 

I was in hopes to have soon seen you in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
but Congress have had the Goodness to resolve upon a 
Commission, very honourable to me, which will detain 
me, I know not how long. 

I hope the States are settling fast into order, and that 
all will go well. There will be disputes for some time 
about the Refugees but I hope they will have no serious 
ill effect It would have been better for them to have had no article, but the Reputation of national Faith and 
Royal honour, inclined the English to insist even on 
this. We could obtain no Peace without it, and therefore we could not hesitate. 

The Interest upon Debts I hope will be made easy, 
but we could obtain no stipulation for it. 

With great and sincere esteem your Friend

Sir, — Yesterday the 9th. of the month, I was presented to the Queen by my Lord Aylesbury, Her Lord 
Chamberlain, having been attended to His Lordship 
and introduced to Him by the Master of the Ceremonies, the Queen was attended by Her Ladies, and I 
made my Compliments to Her Majesty in the following words : 

Madam, — Among the many circumstances which have 
rendered my mission to His Majesty desirable to me, I 
have ever considered it a principal one that I would 
have an opportunity of my making my court to a great 
Queen, whose royal virtues and talents have ever been 
acknowledged and admired in America, as well as in 
all the Nations of Europe, as an example to Princesses 
and the glory of Her sex. 

Permit me Madam to recommend to your Majesty's 
royal goodness a rising Empire, and an infant, virgin 
world — ^Another Europe, Madam, is rising in America. 
To a philosophical mind like Your Majesty's, there can 
not be a more pleasing contemplation than this prospect of doubling the human species, and augmenting 
at the same time their prosperity and Happiness. It 
will in future ages be the glory of these kingdoms to 
have peopled that country, and to have sown there those 
seeds, of science, of liberty, of virtue, and permit me, 
Madam, to adci of piety, which alone constitute the 
prosperity of nations and the happiness of the human 
race. 

After venturing upon such high insinuations to Your 
Majesty, it seems to be descending too far, to ask as I 
do Your Majesty's royal indulgence to a person, who is 
indeed unqualified for Courts, and who owes his elevation to this distinguished honor, of standing before Your 
Majesty, not to any circumstances of illustrious birth, 
fortune or abilities, but merely to an ardent devotion to 
his native Country and some little industry and perseverance in her service. 

The Queen answered me in these words. 

"I thank you Sir, for your civilities to me and my 
family ; and am glad to see you in this Country." The 
Queen then asked me if I had provided myself with a 
house. I answered I have agreed for one Madam this 
morning. She then made her courtesy, and I made my 
reverence, and retired into the drawing-room, where 
the King, Queen, Princess royal and younger Princess, 
Her sister all spoke to me very obligingly. I attended 
until the drawing-room was over, and then returned 
home. 

It has been necessary, in order to guard against false 
reports and malicious fictions, to reduce to writing what 
was said in my audiences of the King and Queen, and 
it is the custom of all Ministers to transmit these compliments to their Courts. I transmit them to you in cypher, that they may be as little exposed to criticism as possible. 

As the Court knew very well that the eyes of all 
Europe were fixed upon these audiences, it may be 
fairly concluded from them, that it is the intention of 
the royal family and the ministry to treat America, that 
is the United States and their Ministers upon the footing of other foreign powers. But our inferences can 
go no farther. We can not infer from this that they 
will relax their navigation act for us any more than for 
France. We are sure of one thing ; that a navigation 
act is in our power as well as in theirs, and that ours 
would be more hurtful to them than theirs to us. In 
short it is scarcely possible to calculate to what an height 
of naval power a navigation act would raise the United 
States in a very few years. With great regard and 
esteem, I have the honor to be 

Dear Sir, 
Yr. Most Obed't. &amp; Humble Serv't.

My dear Friend, — The Letter that accompanies this,

Dear Sir, — A multiplicity of avocations have prevented me from answering your friendly Letter of the 
2d. of July, till I am almost ashamed to answer it at all. 

Your Congratulations on my Arrival and kind Reception are very agreeable because I know them to be sincere. Your Complinients upon my poor volumes are 
consolatory, because they give me grounds to hope that 
they may have done some good. It is an opinion here 
that they contributed somewhat to restore a permanent 
Tranquility to this Commonwealth, as well as to suppress the pestilent County Conventions, Insurrections 
and Rebellion, and if I could be flattered into the belief that they contributed to the formation or Ratification of a ballanced national Government for the United 
States I should sing my Nunc Dimittis with much Pleasure. If any one will shew me a single example, where 
the Laws were respected and Liberty, Property, Life 
or Character Secure, without a Ballance in the Constitution, I might venture to give up the Controversy. 
And if any one will shew that there ever was a Ballance, or ever can be a ballance for three days together 
without three Branches and no more, I might also give 
up the Point. 

I have heard nothing of the second and third volumes in the Southern or Middle States and know not whether they have been read or how received. For 
the third volume I was most anxious as it was the boldest and freest and most likely to be unpopular. 

Whether your expectation that I shall be in the new 
Government, proceeds from your partiality to your old 
Friend, or from your knowledge of the sentiments of 
the Nation, I know not The Choice will be in the 
breasts of Freemen, and if it falls upon me it will most 
certainly be a free election. 

You tell me my Labours are only beginning. Seven and twenty years have I laboured in this rugged Vineyard, and am now arrived at an age when Man sighs for Repose. 

My dear Mrs. Adams is with her only Daughter at 
Long Island. We have three sons, two at Colledge 
and one with an eminent Lawyer. They are regular 
in their manners and studies and give me so much 
satisfaction as to increase the Regret I feel at the 
Remembrance of how much of their Interests I have 
been obliged to sacrifice to the publick service. 

With much esteem and affection I am 

Dear Sir, your most obedient 

humble servant

My dear Friend, — Your obliging favour of the 22. 
ult. I reed, last night. I remember so much of the 
Transactions, at the formation of the Pensilvania Constitution, that I wish you could save Time enough from 
almost any other Pursuit, to arrange your materials for 
an History of the Revolution in Pensilvania, to be published hereafter: at present perhaps it might not be 
prudent The four respectable Characters, who had 
much Influence in the fabrication of your Constitution, 
Mr. Matlack, Mr. Cannon, Mr. Paine, and Dr. Young, 
should be analized and developed in a manner that 
would give offence. Let me give you the Character of 
one of them [Young] in a Conversation which really 
passed in 1772 between Timothy Ruggles and Royal 
Tyler. 

Ruggles. That Tom Young is a Firebrand, an Incendiary, an eternal Fisher in Troubled Waters. <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> 
will never be in Peace, while that Fellow lives in it. He 
is a Scourge, a Pestilence, a Judgment. 

Tyler. Come ! Come ! Don't abuse Dr. Young. 
He is a necessary Man in the Town of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. He is 
in the City, what you are in the House of Reps., a useful Man. 

Ruggles. Useful ! for what ? 

Tyler. I was yesterday in a watchmakers shop, and 
looked over his shoulder, while he put a Watch together. 
The Springs and Wheels were all clean and in good order, every one in its Place as far as I could see, but the 
Watch would not go. The Artist at length with his 
Thumb and forefinger groping in the Dust upon his shopboarcL took up a Ittde dim* Piit scarcely visible to 
my naked sight, Uew off the E)ust and screwed it into a 
particular Part of the Wheelworic. The watch then 
clicked in an instant and went ver)* welK This little 
dirty Screw, are you in the L^slature and Dn Young 
in the Town of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. 

Here was a loud roar of Laughter in the whole 
Company at Ruggles*s expense: but his Wit as seldom 
failed him as his power of Face. With all the Gravit)' 
of a Judge he replied. 

Ruggles. Since you are upon Clock work FU tell 
you what you Resemble: the Pendulum — eternally 
vibrating from one side to the other: but I will do 
you the Justice to say, I never knew one swing so 
clear! 

The answer hit the Character so exactly, that the 
Tide of Laughter was now turned the contrar)'' w^y. 

We have had, my dear Sir, in all the States, in the 
Course of the late Revolution too many of these litde 
Pins, who have acquired the Reputation of Great 
Wheels and main Springs. Legislation requires 
universal knowledge and great experience. How few 
in any age or Country, have been equal to it. In 
America we should have been very excusable, if we 
had found none. Neither our Education, our Prospects 
or Expectations led us to this Frame of Thinking. 
Ages of anarchy and Distraction preceded the formation of such Characters as those of Lycurgus and 
Solon; and long study and laborious Travel, with a 
single view to discover the best forms of Government, 
were scarcely sufficient for their purpose. 

An anxiety for the Consequences of the form of 
Government which I found planning for Pensilvania, 
induced me to throw out those Thoughts on Government which were printed, I believe by Dunlap in 1776. 
If you can find one of them you will oblige me by sending it I have not seen it these Ten years and have not 
been able to find one here, since my return. I remember that you wrote a series of Speculations in the Newspapers about the same time upon the same subject As 
I thought them at the Time both spirited and ingenious 
I wish to see them again. With the Character of Mr. Tench Coxe, I have had for sometime an agreeable 
acquaintance, but knew not that he had employed many 
of his Thoughts about me till I received your Letter. I 
have not seen a Pensilvania Paper, since my return, 
nor did I know but from a Paragraph or two extracted 
into the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Papers, that any Thing had been written 
concerning me. 

The Character you give me of Mr. McClay is very 
agreeable, and the more so, as he is your Friend. His 
real Character was little known here. 

If it should be my destiny to have any share in the 
new Government, you will be very sensible of the 
Delicacy of my situation, and of the Necessity of a 
more accurate Discretion than nature perhaps has 
afforded me. I shall be very happy in your Correspondence, but you will readily agree that it must be very 
confidential. If my sensibility, by long and severe 
exercise had not been almost exhausted, it would have 
been deeply affected, at the late Decision in this State. 
After all the Manoeuvres and Intrigues of a certain 
popular first Magistrate and his faithful emissaries, 
there was not one Man returned by the People from all 
the Districts of the Commonwealth, as an Elector, 
whose sentiments were even equivocal, unless it were 
in a remote Part, whose name I never heard before 

d his opinion was only dubious. 

I am my dear sir, your affectionate Friend,

DEAR Sir, — Your favour of the 19 of March deserves 
rdcular consideration and answer, which I have not 
low been able, from a multitude of avocations some 
lous yet indispensable others of more consequence, 
ive it. 

lie Influence which you suppose I may have as 
ident of the Senate, will be found to be very little, 
if any at all. You say the Eastern States must not be 
suspected : but you know as well as I, that they have 
been suspected these fifteen years and in order to be 
not suspected, or at least not pretended to be suspected, 
either they or some other states must not exist, unless 
those other States send different Members to Congress 
from some that they have already sent. The Place will 
make litde odds — in Georgia, in Maryland, in Pensilvania and in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, suspicion real or feigned would 
be the same. 2. I cannot see that a union of Virginia, 
Pensilvania and Massachusetts, in fixing the seat of 
Government, at one place more than another, would 
increase or diminish their Influence in any future distribution of the great offices of state, nor do I think 
that this Circumstance ought to have any Weight in 
Elections or appointments. 3. I see no symptoms ot 
a corrupt Influence here, more than I always saw at 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and the Inhabitants of this City appear as 
decidedly federal as those of any other Place. 4. The 
foreign Ministers will have very little Influence in determining the Place, in all other respects their Influence 
will be the same in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> as in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 5. 1 
own however that I love <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> quite as well as 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and the noble Libraries there would be a 
strong temptation to me. 6. I think the danger in this 
article is very probable, and a federal Town, to the 
southward of Chesapeake Bay, would be terrible to 
the health of many Gent'n. But what think you of the 
federal Town at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>? 7. I doubt whether conducting Members of Congress to inspect the Treasurj' 
Books is dishonourable. I rather think it laudable. — 
but I cant see however that the Treasury Books should 
determine where Congress is to sit. 8. I wish I knew 
the names of the Gentlemen, the leading Characters 
who were unfriendly to my election, not to make me 
unfriendly to them but the contrary, as far as their 
views are for the public good; — as far as they are 
contrary to that good I should oppose them friends or 
ennemies. 

I know very well I have many Friends in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
many more and more sincere than in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> : but 
all this ought not to influence me in giving votes for 
public Measures. 

But to come to the Point I am situated in the Constitution, in a manner, that will render it proper for me to 
be neutral in such a Contest. I shall never be a zealous 
advocate for sitting in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, because I am not 
convinced that it i3 more for the public advantage, than 
to sit elsewhere. 

Let me now if you please remember your Letter of 
2 2d. of April. 

Mv situation at the head of the Senate, where I was 
placed by the People at large, not as the Members were 
by their Legislatures, instead of giving me an influence 
as you suppose, will prevent me from having any. Mr. Wilson I have long known, esteemed and respected : 
but, if I had a Vote, I could not promise to give it for 
him to be Chief Justice. All Things considered, that 
have ever come to my knowledge I feel myself inclined 
to wish, because I am fully convinced that services, 
Hazards, Abilities and Popularity all properly weighed, 
the Ballance is in favour of Mr. Jay. One of the 
Judges I wish Mr. Wilson to be : and the difference is 
not great between the first and the other Judges. 

You say I had not a firmer Friend in the late election. 
I must protest against this mode of reasoning. I am 
not obliged to vote for a Man because he voted for me, 
had my office been ever so lucrative or ever so important. But ask your own heart. Is not my election to 
this office, in the scurvy manner in which it was done, 
a curse rather than a Blessing ? Is there Gratitude ? 
is there Justice? is there common sense or decency 
in this Business? Is it not an indelible stain on our 
Country, Countrymen and Constitution ? I assure you 
I think it so, and nothing but an apprehension of great 
Mischief, and the final failure of the Government from 
my Refusal and assigning my reasons for it, prevented 
me from Spuming it 

Now my Friend we start fisur. Never must I again 
hear a selfish Motive urged to me, to induce my vote 
or Influence in publick affairs. 

I never served the Public one moment in my Life, 
but to*the loss and injury of myself and my Children, 
and I suffer as much by it at this moment as ever. 

I am with great esteem dear sir, your 

Friend and serv't

Dear Sir, — No ! You and I will not cease to discuss 
political questions : but we will agree to disagree whenever we please, or rather whenever either of us thinks 
he has reason for it I really know not what you mean 
by apeing the Corruptions of the British Court 

I wish Congress had been called to meet at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> : but as it is now here, I can conceive of no way 
to get it transported thither, without tearing and rending. I own to you, that I shall wish to remain here 
rather than go to any other place than <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
Congress can not be accomodated in any other than a 
great City. 

There was a dark and dirty Intrigue, which propagated in the Southern States that New England would 
not vote for G. Washington, and in the Northern States 
that <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, Virginia and South Carolina would not 
vote for him but that all would vote for me, in order to 
spread a panick lest I should be President, and G. W. 
Vice President : and this manoeuvre made dupes even 
of two Connecticut electors. I am well aware that this 
plott originated in N. York and am not at a Loss to 
guess the Men or their Motives. I know very well how 
to make these Men repentof their Rashness. It would be 
easy to sett on foot an Inquiry : but it is not worth while. 

That every Part of the Conduct and feelings of the 
Americans tends to that species of Republick called a 
limited Monarchy I agree. They were born and brought 
up in it. Their Habits are fixed in it : but their Heads 
are most miserably bewildered about it. There is not 
a more ridiculous Spectacle in the Universe than the 
Politicks of our Country exhibits : bawling about Republicanism which they understand not ; and acting a 
Farce of Monarchy. We will have as you say " but 
one great Man" yet even he shall not be a great Man. 

I also, am as much a Republican as I was in 1775. I 
do not " consider hereditary Monarchy or Aristocracy 
as Rebellion against Nature." On the contrary I esteem \/^ 
them both Institutions of admirable wisdom and exemplary Virtue in a certain stage of Society in a great 
Nation. The only Institutions that can possibly preserve the Laws and Liberties of the People, and I am clear that America must resort to them as an Asylum 
against Discord, Seditions and Civil War, and that at 
no very distant Period of time. I shall not live to see 
it — but you may. I think it therefore impolitick to 
cherish prejudices against Institutions which must be 
kept in view as the hope of our Posterity. I am by no 
means for attempting any such thing at present Our 
Country is not ripe for it in many respects, and it is not 
yet necessary, but our ship must ultimately land on that 
shore or be cast away. 

I do not ** abhor Tides, nor the Pageantry of Government." If I did I should abhor Government itself: 
for there never was, and never will be, because there 
/ never can be, any Government without Tides and 
Pageantry. There is not a Quaker Family in Pensilvania, governed without Tides and Pageantry : not a 
school, not a coUedge, not a clubb can be governed 
without them. 

"I love the People,*' with you — too well to cheat 
them, lie to them or deceive them. I wish those who 
have flattered them so much had loved them half as 
well. If I had not loved them I never would have 
served them — if I did not love them now, I would not 
serve them another hour — for I very well know that 
vexation and Chagrine, must be my Portion, every 
moment I shall continue in public Life. 

My Country appears to me I assure you in great 
danger of fatal Divisions, and especially because I 
scarcely know of two Persons, who think, speak and 
act alike, in matters of Government. 

I am with real Friendship yours

Dear Sir, — Your single Principle in your Letter of 
the 15th must fail you. You say "that Republican 
Systems have never had a fair Tryal." What do you 
mean by a " fair Tryal" ? and what by Republican systems? Every Government that has more than one 
Man in its sovereignty is a republican system. Tryals 
innumerable have been made — as many as there have 
existed Nations. There is not and never was, I believe, 
on earth, a Nation, which has not been, at some Period 
of its duration, under a Republican Government: Le. 
under a Government of more than one. All the various 
combinations and modifications which the subtle Brains 
of Men could invent have been attempted, to no other 
purpose but to shew that Discord, Anarchy and Uncertainty of Life, Liberty and Property, can be avoided 
only by a perfect equilibrium in the Constitution. You 
seem determined not to allow a limited monarchy to be 
a republican system, which it certainly is, and the best 
that has ever been tryed. 

There is no Proposition, of the Truth of which I am 
more clearly convinced than this, that the ** Influence of 
general Science," instead of curing any defects in an 
unballanced Republick, would only increase and inflame 
them and make them more intoUerable : for this obvious 
and unanswerable Reason, that Parties would have in 
them, a greater number of able and ambitious Men, 
who would only understand the better, how to worry 
one another with greater Art and dexterity. Religion 
itself by no means cures this inveterate evil, for parties 
are always founded on some Principle, and the more 
conscientious Men are, the more determined they will 
be in pursuit of their Principle, System and Party. 

I should as soon think of closing all my window 
shutters, to enable me to see, as of banishing the 
Classicks, to improve Republican Ideas. How can 
you say that Factions have been few in America ? Have 
they not rendered Property insecure ? have they not 
trampled Justice under foot .^ have not Majorities voted 
property out of the pocketts of others into their own, 
with the most decided Tyranny ? 

Have not our Parties behaved like all Republican 
Parties 'i is not the History of Hancock and Bowdoin, 
the History of the Medici and Albizi — that of Clinton 
and Yates, the same with that of the Cancellieri and the 
Panchiatichi ? and so on through the Continent And 
we shall find that without a Ballance the Progress will 
soon be, from Libels to Riots, from Riots to Seditions 
and from Seditions to Civil Wars. 

Every Project to enlighten our Fellow Citizens has 
my most hearty good wishes : because it tends to bring 
them into a right way of thinking respecting the means 
of their Happiness, civil, political, social and religious. 

I wish with all my heart, that the Constitution had 
expressed as much Homage to the Supreme Ruler of 
the Universe as the President has done in his first 
speech. The Petit Maitres who call themselves Legislators and attempt to found a Government on any other 
than an eternal Basis of Morals and Religion, have as 
much of my Pitty as can consist with Contempt 

I am my dear sir yours

Dear Sir, — ^Without waiting for an answer to my 
last, I will take a little more notice of a sentiment in 
one of your Letters. You say you " abhor all Titles." 
I will take the familiar freedom of Friendship to say I 
dont believe you. Let me explain myself. I doubt 
not your veracity, but I believe you deceive yourself 
and have not yet examined your own heart, and recollected the feelings of every day and hour. What 
would you say or think or feel, if your own Children, instead of calling you Sir, or Father or Papa, 
should accost you with the Title of ** Ben" ? Your servant comes in, and instead of saying, ** Master, my hat 
is much worn, will you please to give me a new one," 
crys " Ben ! my old hat is all in rags, and makes you 
the laughing stock of the Town. Give me a new one." 
What think you of this simple, manly republican 
style? 

Had I leisure to write Plays like Gen. Burgoine, I 
wbuld undertake a Comedy, under the Title of " Government without Tide." The Dramatis Persona should 
be a Quaker and his wife, ten Children and four servants. They should all live in the same room, dine, 
breakfast and sup at the same Table. They should 
promiscuously call each other by their Names, without 
Tides and live without form. We should see what 
order, Virtue and Economy would ensue. The sons 
would soon be married to the female servants aiid the 
Daughters to the Male. Both Children and servants 
would soon kick and cuff the old Man and Woman. 

Poh, Poh, Poh! Say you all this is vulgar and 
beneath the Dignity of a Legislator. Give me leave to 
say nothing In human Life is beneath the EKgnity of a 
Magistrate to consider. The Principles of Government 
are to be seen in ever}' scene of human Life. There 
is no person and no Sodet&gt;% to whom Forms and Titles 
are indifferent. Look through the Deeds of Men, and 
then say whether Shenestone is not in the rig^t, when 
he says in a whimsical Production called the '* SchoolMistress" which he wrote in imitation of Spencer : 

" Albeit nc flatt'rj did comrpc her Tnith, 

'' Ne pompotts Title did delnach her ear, 

'' Goodj, good-woman. Gossip, n'axint, forsooth 

'' Or Dame, the sole additions she did hear : 

'' Yet these she challenged ; these she held right dear 

'' Ne woald esteem him act as mooght behove 

''Who should not honoor'd eld with these rerere : 

'' For never title jet so mean could prore, 

** Bat there was eke a mind, which did that title love." 

The two last Lines contain a truth so exact, so universal, and so litteral, that I declare to you, in the Course 
of fifty years experience, in various stages of Life 
among all Classes of People and in several different 
nations I have never yet met with one Man, Woman or 
Child, who was destitute of a Passion for a Tide. 

Let us consider, my Friend more reverendy and 
therefore more truly the Constitution of human nature, 
and the invariable Progress of human Life and manners. Family Titles are necessary to Family Government ; Colonial Tides we know were indispensible in 
Colonial Government, and we shall find national Tides 
essential to national Government As long as Tides * 
are respected by others, they will be esteemed by every 
Man. But it is not to gratify individuals that public 
Titles are annexed to offices. It is to make offices and 
laws respected : and not so much by the virtuous Part 
of the Community, as by the Profligate, the criminal 
and abandoned, who have little reverence for Reason, 
Right or Law divine or human. These are overawed 
by Tides frequently, when Laws and Punishments cannot restrain them. 

Think of these Things, and perhaps I may hint to 
you some others hereafter. 

Yours with sincere esteem,

Dear Sir, — I have read Dr. Rush De Moribus Ger
manorum with Pleasure. As I am a great lover of 

Paradoxes, when defended with Ingenuity, I have read 

also the Phillippic against Latin and Greek, with some 

amusement: but my Reverence for those Languages 

and the inestimable Treasures hoarded up in them is 

not abated. J. J. Rousseau's Phillippic against Arts 

and Sciences amused, informed, and charmed me— 

but I have loved and admired Arts and Sciences the 

better from that time to this. What an Ingrate was 

he to employ Art and Science to abuse them ! and 

are you much better, to use the knowledge and skill 

you derived from Latin and Greek, to slander those 

divine Languages ? 

Yours ut supra 

J. A.

My dear Frxexd, — I have persecuted you too mudi 
with my Letters. I beg you would give yourself no 
trouble to answer them, but when \*ou are quite at 
Leisure, from more important Business or more agreaWe amusement. 

I denv. that there is or ever was in Eurooe a more 
free Republic than England, or that any Libert}' on 
Earth ever equalled English Liberty, notwithstanding 
the defects in their Constitudon. 

The Idea of admitting absolute Monarchy into this 
Countrv", either in this or the next Centurv strilies me 
with horror. A little wisdom at present, may preserve 
a free Government in .America, I hope for ever--certainly for many Centuries. 

I agree with you, that hereditary- Monarchy and 
herediiar)' Aristocrac)*, ought not yet to be attempted 
in America — and that three ballanced Branches, ought 
to be at stated Periods elected by the People. Thb 
must and wiU and ought to continue, till Intrigue and 
Corruption, Faction and Sedition shall appear in those 
elections to such a degree as to render hereditary 
Institutions a Remedy against a greater e\'il. 

I learned in my youth from one of my Preceptors, 
VattelL B. 2. c 3 ss. 41. that "a Nation may grant to 
its Conductor, what decree of Authoritv and what 
rights it thinks proper : it is equally free, in regard to 
the Name, the Tides, and honours, with which it would 
decorate him. But it is agreable to its Wisdom, and 
of Importance to its Reputation, not to deviate in this 
respect, too much from the Customs commonly received 
among civilized Nations. Let us still observe that it 
ought to be directed there by Prudence, to proportion 
titles and honours, to the Power of its Superiour and 
to the Authority with which it would invest him. Tides 
and Honours it is true determine nothing: they are 
vain names and vain Ceremonies when they are ill 
placed : but who does not know the Influence they have 
on the Thoughts of Men ? This is then a more serious 
affair than it appears at the first glance. The Nation 
ought not to degrade its conductor, by too low a Title. 
It ought to be still more careful not to swell his heart 
with a vain name, by unbounded honours ; so as to make 
him conceive the Thoughts of arrogating to himself a 
Power answerable to them, or to acquire a proportionable Power by unjust Conquests. On the other hand, 
an important Tide may engage the Conductor, to support with greater firmness the Dignity of a Nation. 
Conjectures determine the Prudence which observes in 
every Thing a just Proportion." All the Reading, 
Observation and Reflection of thirty or 35 years, have 
confirmed these Truths in my mind. 

Among the Romans Scipio was Imperator, and Caesar 
was Pontifex Maximus. They were Tribunus Sacer, 
Pater Conscriptus, and Patronus excellentissimus, on 
all occasions, and the Prolocutor of the Senate was 
Prince of the Senate. There is not a grosser error in 
the World, than the common saying that the Romans 
had no Titles. 

We come now to your question, which has great 
weight and solidit&gt;\ " If we begin with Titles where 
will they end ?" It is true as you say " the States still 
retain the Power of creating Titles," or at least they 
may claim it. You ask another very important and cEfficuIt Question, " By what Rule shall we settle Precedency y^ 

I will ndtfaer undertake to answer, where we sfaaD 
end, nor to determine the Rule. But riiis I will venture 
to say, that we never shall have either Government, or 
Tranquility or Liberty, until some Rule of Precedency 
is adopted, and some Titles setded. The question is 
not whether Titles shall be admitted into our Country. 
They are already in it, and you will annihilate the Nation 
before you will eradicate them. The question is whether 
Provincial Tides or Diplomatic Tides, can preserve or 
acquire Consideration at home or abroad to a nadonal 
Government. I totally deny that diere is any Thing in 
Reason or Religion against Tides proportioned to Ranks 
and Truth, and I affirm that they are indispensably 
necessary to give Dignity and Energy to Government : 
and on this ground alone I am an advocate for them. 
In my private Character, I despise them as much at 
least as any Quaker, or Philosopher on Earth. 

You may depend on being the Contempt, the Scorn 
and the Derision of all Europe, while you call your 
national Conductor, General or President. You may 
depend on another Thing. The State Government will 
ever be uppermost in America in the Minds of our 
own People, till you give a superiour Tide to your first 
national Magistrate. 

The most modest Tide you can give him, in any 
reasonable Proportion, to the wealth. Power and Population of this Country and to the constitutional authority 
and Dignity of his office is **His Majest}', the President," This is my opinion, and I scorn to be hypocrite 
enough to disguise it. Miracles will not be wrought 
for us. We dont deserve them. If we will have 
Government, we must use human and natural means. 
Titles and Ranks are as essential to Government, as 
Reason and Justice. In short Government is nothing 
else but Titles, Ceremonies and Ranks. They alone 
enable Reason to produce Justice. 

I am with usual esteem and regard 

dear sir, yours

Dear Sir, — "The Characters, I so much admire 
among the ancients,** were not ** formed wholly by 
Republican forms of Government." I admire Phillip 
and Alexander, as much as I do Themistocles and 
Pericles, nay as much as Demosthenes. I admire Pisistratus almost as much as Solon ; and think that the 
Arts, Elegance, Literature and Science of Athens was 
his work and that of his Sons, more than of any or all 
the popular Commanders or orators. 

The two Republicks of Antiquity that I most admire 
are Sparta and Rome, and these were both monarchical 
Republicks. Athens indeed was ballanced with great 
Care and some Art, till Aristides overturned the Constitution to make himself popular, and acquire the 
Title of just. So that I think the Man who voted to 
ostracize him because he was called just by the Mob, 
was a Man of sense, spirit and virtue. 

You doubt whether Titles overawe the profligate. 
You ask where do I find more profligate manners than 
among the citizens of London. I am almost disposed 
to answer you by saying, in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, in 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. I assure you, my friend I wish my dear 
Countrymen had less Vanity and more Pride. The 
advantages we have over Europe, are chiefly geographical. I see very little moral or political Preference. 
As far as I can judge there is as much Vice, Folly, and 
more Infidelity, Idleness, Luxury and Dissipation, in 
any of our great Towns in Proportion to Numbers, 
as in London. But the Question should be what 
would be the degree of Profligacy in London, if there 
were no Titles? and I seriously believe it would be 
much greater than it is. Nay I dont believe it would 
be possible to support any Government at all, among 
such Multitudes without Distinctions of Rank and the 
Titles that mark them. According to what I have seen 
in England, as well as France, Holland, Spain and 
Germany, there is nothing strikes and overawes the 
most abandoned of the Populace so much as Titles. 

Whether Titles beget Pride in Rulers or not is not 
an argument. Would you reject every Thing that begets Pride ? If you do you must reject Virtue, which 
begets the most exquisite, exalted and unconquerable 
Pride. You must reject Laws, Government, offices of 
all kind, and even Religion. Spiritual Pride has grown 
out of Religion. Would you reject Religion ? 

Men who would be made proud by a Title, will be 
made so by an office without a Title. 

But why should Titles beget Baseness among the 
common People ? Respect, Reverence, Submission and 
Obedience to the Laws and lawful Magistrates you 
would wish to see both in the virtuous and vicious of 
the common People. If obedience cannot be obtained 
from the vicious without begetting Baseness, by which 
I suppose you mean fear, why should you object to 
that ? But Titles have no tendency to beget Baseness 
in poor Men who are virtuous, more than offices without Titles. 

But I must insist that Laws are made and Magistrates appointed on purpose to create Fear and Terror 
in the Minds of the vicious, and if Titles will save you 
the expense of Gallows, stocks, whipping posts, or the 
Pain of employing them, why not use them ? If Titles 
will do instead of armies and Navies, or any Part of 
them, why reject them? Don't the Gallows beget 
Baseness in the Common People? Would you have 
no Gallows ? Dont a prison beget Baseness ? Would 
you have no Prison ? Dont all sorts of Punishments 
beget Baseness? Would you abolish all Punishments ? 

You say the conquered Provinces first introduced 
Titles into the Roman Empire. But in this I believe 
you are mistaken. Had the Kings of Rome, no 
Titles ? 

Vir amplissimus, Vir Clarissimus, Vir amplissimus 
Consul, Vir Summus. These were familiar among them 
in the simplest times. 

Historians indeed never use Titles, — but Titles were 
used in Life, and had their influence. 

1. The Romans conferred Titles very early, e.g.y 
Manlius, Capitolinus, and very late as Scipio Africanus. 
These Titles were very common and had greit Influence, 
for they carried with them the Ideas of Tryumphs and 
Glorys beyond any Titles in our Times. 

2. They managed their Agnomen, Cognomen and 
Nomen in a manner, to influence the People, as much 
as our Titles, Cicero tells us what was their Custom, 

** Nomen cum dicimus, cognomen quoque et Agnomen, 
intelligatur, oportet" 

I. The Praenomen was our Christian Name. 2. The 
Nomen was the Name of a Race, or Gens; as all 
descended from lulus the son of Eneas the son of 
Venus, were called lulii, and were accounted divine. 3. 
The Cognomen distinguished different Families of the 
same Race ; for Gens signified the whole and Familia a 
Part Those of the same Gens were called Gentiles, 
[whence our word Genteel and Gendeman]. Those of 
the same Family Agnati. The Agnomen, like Sdpio 
Africanus and Scipio Asiaticus, has been mentioned 
before. Julius signified the Gens and Caesar the 
Familia. 

As these Families and Races happened to be of consular, Praetorian, or Tribunitian Dignit)% or even only 
of Patrician Dignity, their names carried more influence 
than the Titles of Princes, Dukes, Marquises, Earls, 
Barons do at this day in Europe, for we must always 
recollect that these Families and offices were all consecrated, and consequendy struck the Roman Mind which 
was certainly more superstitious, if not more religious 
than ours, with an holy awe. In order to form some 
Idea of the religious veneration, approaching to adoration, which the Roman Policy inspired into the Minds 
of their Citizens towards their Magistraties and the 
Races and Families which exercised them, we must 
recollect their Leges Sacratae. 

And what was a Lex Sacrata ? Sacratae leges sunt, 
[inquit Festus] quibus Sancitum est, qui quid adversus 
eas fecerit, sacer alieni deorum sit, cum familia, pecun* 
iaque. There were several of these Sacred Laws, 
by which all their Magistrates were protected. The Lex Sacrata passed upon the holy Mountain, for the 
Security of the Tribunes, is in Dionysius as follows, 
** Tribunum nemo in ordinem redigito, neque invitum 
quidquam facere cogito, nee verberato, nee alium verberare jubeto. Si quis eontra feeerit, saeer esto, et bona 
ejus Cereri Saera sunto: et qui eum oeeiderit, purus a 
eaede esto: — hane legem omnes juraverunt seque et 
Posteros in sempiternum observaturos." Only consider 
the effect of taking an oath by all the People to observe 
this Law. 

Now sir, I contend, that as Consuls, Praetors, Tribunes, etc., were consecrated officers, the Title of Sacrosanctus belonged to them all, and was little short of that 
of sacred Majesty. I say farther that Patres Conscripti 
was an higher Title than my Lords, or most Honourable, and that the Names of Sacred Gentes, et Familiae 
had greater influence among the Romans than modern 
European Titles. 

Never let me again hear the Romans quoted as 

neglecting or despising Titles. If I do, I will persecute 

you with more Latin. 

Yours affectionately,

Dear Sir, — I had heard before I reed, your Letter of 
the 1 2th. of your new engagements in the Colledge 
added to your extensive Practice and other virtuous 
Pursuits, and therefore was at no loss to account for 
your long silence. 
I have no pretensions to the Merit of your manly 
and successful opposition to the Constitution of Pensilvania ; but I am very willing to be responsible for any 
Consequences of its Rejection. I have never despised 
public opinion deliberately. If I have ever expressed 
myself lighdy of it, it was in haste and without caution. 
On the contrary it is always to be respected and treated 
with decency, even when in error ; but never to be made 
the Rule of Action against Conscience. It is seldom 
and only in small matters to be followed implicitly. It 
is a wave of the sea in a storm in the Gulph Stream, 
except when it is the result of methodical Councils or 
secret Influence. It should be guided and aided as well 
as informed by those who are in Possession of all the 
secrets of the State. In no nation that ever yet existed, 
were all the Facts known to the whole Body or even a 
Majority of the People, which were essential to the 
formation of a right Judgment of public affairs. The 
History of this Country for the last thirty years, affords 
as many proofs of this Truth as that of any other 
Nation. How many times, both at home and abroad 
have our affairs been in situations, that none but Madmen would have thought proper to be published in detail to the People. 

You are not the only one who has seen and felt The 
Jealousy, Envy and Ingratitude of Friends. 

** I love my friend as well as you, 

*' But why should he obstruct my view?" 

contains a Truth which has laid the foundation for every 
Despotism and every absolute Monarchy on Earth. It 
is this sentiment which ruins every Democracy and 
ever)' Aristocracy, and ever)' possible Mixture of both, 
and renders a mediating Power an invincible equilibrium 
between them indispensible. Never yet was a Band of 
Heroes or Patriots able to bear the sight of any one of 
them constantly at their head, if they saw any opening 
to avoid it Emulation almost the only Principle of 
Activit)', [except Hunger and Lust] is the Cause of all 
the Wars, Seditions, and Parties in die World. What 
is most astonishing is, that we should be so ignorant of 
it, or inattentive to it, and that we should not see, that 
an independent Executive Power, able at all times to 
overrule these Ri\'alries, is absolutely necessary. 

The charming Picture you give me of your Domestic 
Felicity delights my inmost soul : but revives in me a 
lively regret for the ten years of my Life that I lost ; — 
when I left my Children to grow up without a Father. 

There are two Parties my friend, who have united in 
some degree, to obscure the fame of the old Whiggs. 
The Tories are one, and the Young Fry is the other. 
By the latter I mean a sett of young Gentlemen who 
have come out of CoUedge since the Revolution, and 
are Candidates for fame. There is a sett of Men in 
this Country who have hazarded too much, laboured too 
much, suffered too much, and succeeded too well ever 
to be forgiven. Some of these unfortunately are not 
Men of large views and comprehensive Information, 
and have adopted destructive systems of Policy. Were 
it not for this last Consideration, you would hear their 
Cause pleaded in accents that would make Impressions 
on every honest human heart. 

You, my dear sir, enjoy the esteem of the honest and 
enlightened and are perhaps more usefully and happily 
employed than others in places of more eclat There is no Man however that I should see with more Pleasure 
in public Life, especially in Congress. 
With a Knowledge of the modern Languages it is so 
easy to acquire the ancient, and the ancient are so great 
a step towards the acquisition of the Modern, that I 
cannot help putting in a Word more in favour of Greek 
and Latin. 

I am, my dear Sir, your Friend 

<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">John Adams</a>.

I forbid you, on pain of what shall fall thereon, from 
giving me a Title in your Letters. I scorn, disdain, 
despise, [take what Word you will] all Titles.

Dear Sir, — I cannot give up my dear Latin and 
Greek although Fortune has never permitted me to 
enjoy so much of them as I wished. I dont love you 
the less however for your Indifference or even opposition to them. Pray do you carry your Theory so far 
as to wish to exclude French, Italian, Spanish, and 
Tudesque ? 

I begun to fear that your multiplied phisical and 
other engagements had made you forget me. But 
am much obliged to you for introducing Mr. Andrew 
Brown, to whom I wish success. 

I congratulate you, on the Prospect of a new Constitution for Pensilvania. Poor France I fear will bleed, 
for too exactly copying your old one. 

When I see such miserable crudities approved by 
such Men as Roche&amp;ucault and Condorcet I am disposed to diink ver}' humbly of human understanding.

pitt&gt;' them without being able to help them.

Dear Sir, — ^The Tories as you observe in your 
friendly Letter of 24 Feb. are more attached to each 
other ; they are also, we must candidly confess, more 
of real Politicians. They make to themselves more 
merit with the People, for the smallest services, than 
the Whigs are able to do for the greatest. The Arts, 
the Trumpetts, the Puffs, are their old Instruments and 
they know how to employ them. The History of our 
Revolution will be one continued Lye from one end to 
the other. The essence of the whole will be that Dr. ^ 
Franklins electrical Rod, smote the Earth and out sprung 
General Washington. That Franklin electrified him 
with his rod — and tlience forward tliese two condiuted 
all t/ie Policy, Negotiations, Legislatures and War. 
These underscored Lines contain the whole Fable Plot 
and Catastrophy. If this Letter should be preserved, 
and read an hundred years hence the Reader will say, 
" the envy of this J. A. could not bear to think of tiie 
Truth ! He ventured to scribble to Rush, as envious 
as himself, Blasphemy that he dared not speak when he 
lived. But Barkers at the Sun and Moon are always 
Silly Curs." But this my Friend, to be serious, is the 
Fate of all ages and Nations ; and there is no resource 
in human nature for a Cure. Brederode did more in 
the Dutch Revolution than William ist Prince of 
Orange. Yet Brederode is forgotten and William the 
Saviour, Deliverer and Founder. Limited Monarchy 
is founded in Nature. No Nation can adore more than 
one Man at a time. It is an happy Circumstance that 
the object of our Devotion is so well deserving of it; 
that he has virtue so exquisite and wisdom so consummate. There is no Citizen of America will say, 
that there is in the World so fit a Man for the head of 
the Nation. From my soul I think there is not ; and 
the Question should not be who has done or suffered 
most, or who has been the most essential and Indispensable Cause of the Revolution, but who is best 
qualified to govern us ? Nations are not to sacrifice 
their Future Happiness to Ideas of Historical Justice. 
They must consult their own Weaknesses, Prejudices, 
Passions, Senses and Imaginations as well as their 
Reason. ** La Raison n'a jamais fait grande chose," as 
the K. of Prussia says in his Histoire de mon temps. 

The more extracts you send me from your Journals, 
the more you will oblige me, — I beg especially a Copy 
of my Character. I know very well it must be a 
partial Panegyrick. I will send you my criticisms upon 
it. You know I have no affectation of Modesty. My 
Comfort is that such vain Folly as Cicero, Neckar, Sir 
William Temple and I are never dangerous. 

If I said in 1777 that "we should never be qualified 
for Republican Government till we were ambitious to 
be poor ' I meant to express an Impossibility. I meant 
then and now say that No Nation under Heaven ever 
, now IS, or ever will be qualified for a Republican 
remment, unless you mean by these words, Equal 
IS resulting from a Ballance of three Powers, the 
larchical, Aristocratical and Democratical. I meant 
•e and I now repeat more explicitly, that Americans 
peculiarly unfit for any Republic but the Aristonocratical-Monarchy ; because they are more Ava)us than any other Nation that ever existed the 
thaginians and Dutch not excepted. The Alieni 
etens sui profusus reigns in this nation as a Body 
•e than any other I have ever seen. 
Vhen I went to Europe in 1778 I was full of patriotic 
jects like yours of collecting Improvements in Arts, 
-iculture, Manufacture, Commerce, Litterature, and 
ince. But I soon found my error. I found that my 
:es demanded every moment of my time and the 
stance of two or three Clerks, and that all this was 
enough. I was obliged to make it a Rule never to 
3ut of my Road for any Curiosity of any kind. J. J. 
isseau understood it very well when he said that 
bassadors "doivent tout leur temps a cet objet 
jue, ils sont trop honnetes gens pour voler leur 
ent." Emile, Tom. 4. p. 361. If he meant this as a 
casm he was in the wrong. I never knew one who 
impted or affected Philosophy, that was good for any 
ng in the Diplomatique Line — ^and I know that every 
ur that I might have employed that way would have 
n a Robbery upon the duties of my Public Char
Tour Fartiily pictures are charming, and the tender 
ty you express for your Mother, is felt by me in all 
Force, as I have a Mother living in her eighty second 
r, to whom I owe more than I can ever pay. This 



^J 
/ Mother and a Father who died 30 years ago, two of the 
^ best People I ever knew, formed the Character that you 
have drawn. Alas ! that it is no better ! 

I said before that Vanity is not dangerous. A Man 
who has bad designs is seldom or never vain. It is such 
modest Rascals as Caesar, who play tricks with Mankind. 
Read his Commentaries — what consummate caution to 
conceal his Vanity ! Contemptu famae, fama augebatur. 
This Tyrants and Villains always know. 

Adieu Mon Ami, 

<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">John Adams</a>.

Pray can you recollect a Feast at Point no Point in 
the Fall of 1775 and the Company that returned with 
you and me in a Boat and our Conversation. 

I want a List of the Names of that Party who returned in the same Boat with us to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>.

My Dear Sir, — Your Letter of April 13, soars above 

^ '\y^ the visible diurnal sphere. I own to you that avarice, 
ambition, the Love of Fame &amp;c., are all mysterious 
Passions. They are the greatest absurdities. Delusions and Follies that can be imaqfined, if in this Life 
only we had hope. 

In the Boat on our Return from Point no Point, the 
principal Topick of Conversation was Independence, 
An intercepted Letter early in 1775 had informed the 
world that I was for Independence : and my sentiments 
on this head were no secret in Congress from May 
1775. But I was left too much alone. 
The Company in the Boat appeared to me, then and 
ever since, to have invited me to be of their Party, that 
they might all assure me in that Confidential manner, 
that they were of my mind and would ultimately support me. There was not one of the Company I believe, 
who in the Course of the Passage did not repeatedly 
assure me, that in his opinion we must be independent. 
That evenings Conversation was a great encouragement to me ever after. 

How many Follies and indiscreet Speeches do your 
minutes in your Note Book bring to my Recollection, 
which I had forgotten forever ! Alas I fear I am not 
yet much more prudent. 

Your Character of Mr. Paine is very well and very just. 

To The Accusation against me which you have recorded in your Note Book of 17th. of March last, I 
plead not guilty. I deny both Charges. I deny an 
** Attachment to Monarchy," and I deny that I have 
"changed my Principles since 1776." 

No Letter of mine to Mr. Hooper was ever printed 
that I know of. Indeed I have but a very confused 
Recollection of having ever written him any Letter. If 
any Letter has been printed in my Name I desire to 
see it. You know that a Letter of mine to Mr. Wythe 
was printed by Dunlap, in Jany. 1776 under the Title of 
Thoughts on Government in a Letter from a Gentleman 
to his Friend. In that Pamphlet I recommended a Legislature in three independent Branches and to such 
a Legislature I am still attached. But I own at that 
time I understood very little of the subject, and if I 
had changed my opinions should have no scruple to 
avow it. 

I own that awful experience has concurred with Reading and Reflection to convince me that Americans 
are more rapidly disposed to Corruption in Elections, 
than I thought they were fourteen years ago. 

My Friend Dn Rush will excuse me if I caution him 
against a fraudulent use of the words Monarchy and 
Republick. I am a mortal and irreconcileable enemy 
to Monarchy. I am no Friend to hereditary limited 
Monarchy in America. This I know can never be admitted without an hereditary Senate to controul it ; and 
an hereditary Nobility or Senate in America I know 
to be unattainable and impracticable. I should scarcely 
be for it, if it were attainable. Dont therefore my 
Friend misunderstand me and misrepresent me to Posterity. I am for a Ballance between the Legislative 
and Executive Powers and I am for enabling the Executive to be at all times capable of maintaining the Ballance between the Senate and House or in other 
words between the Aristocratical and Democratical 
Interests. Yet I am for having all three Branches 
elected at stated Periods ; and these elections I hope 
will continue, until the People shall be convinced, that 
Fortune, <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> or Chance, call it which you will, 
is better than election. If the time should come when 
Corruption shall be added to Intrigue and Manoeuvre 
in elections and produce civil War, then in my opinion 
Chance will do better than Choice for all but the House 
of Representatives. 

Accept my Thanks for your polite and obliging Invitation to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. Nothing would give me greater 
Pleasure than such a visit, but I must deny myself that 
satisfaction. I know I have friends in Pensilvania, and 
such as I esteem very highly as the Friends of Virtue, 
Liberty and Good Government. 

What you may mean by " more than British degrees 
of Corruption" at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and by sophisticated 
Government, I know not. The Continent is a kind of 
a Whispering Gallery and Acts and Speeches are reverberated round from N. York in all Directions. The 
Report is very loud at a distance, when the Whisper is 
very gentle in the Center. But if you see such Corruptions in your Countrymen, on what do you found your 
hopes ? 

I lament the deplorable Condition of my Country, which seems to be under such a Fatality that the People 
can agree upon nothing. When they seem to agree they are so unsteady, that it is but for a Moment. That 
Changes may be made for the better is probable. I know of no Change that would occasion much Danger 
but that of President. I wish very heartily that a Change of Vice President could be made tomorrow. I 
have been too ill used in the office to be fond of it, if I had not been introduced into it, in a manner that made 
it a disgrace. I will never serve in it again upon such Terms. Though I have acted in public with immense 
Multitudes, I have had few friends, and these certainly not interested ones : — these I shall ever love in public 
or private. 

Adieu my dear Sir

Dear Sir, — It seemeth unto me, that you and I ought 
not to die without saying Goodby or bidding each other 
Adieu. Pray how do you do ? How does that excellent Lady Mrs. R. ? How are the young Ladies? 
Where is my Surgeon and Lt ? How fares the Lawyer? 

Two learned and famous Physicians, Sydenham and 
Rush, have taught us that the Plague and the Yellow 
Fever and all other epidemic Diseases, when they prevail in a City, convert all other Disorders into Plague. 
I cannot help thinking that Democracy is a Distemper 
of this kind and when it is once set in motion and obtains a Majority it converts every Thing good bad and 
indifferent into the dominant epidemic. Here is our 
good old New England, almost as far gone as the united 
Irishmen in Pensilvania, as some People think and say, 
I am not however of that opinion yet. 

In good sooth, my old Friend, are Pensylvania and 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, at present, in the system of their true Interests ? Has our old Friend McKean assisted in conjuring up a spirit from the vasty Deep that he is unable 
to lay ? 

Let me put a few Questions to your Conscience, for 
I know you have one. Is the present state of the Nation Republican enough? Is Virtue the Principle of 
our Government? Is honour? Or is Ambition and 
avarice, adulation, Baseness, Covetousness, the thirst of 
Riches, indifference concerning the Means of rising and 
enriching, the contempt of Principle, the spirit of Party 
and of Faction the Motive and the Principle that governs ? These are serious and dangerous Questions : 
but Serious Men ought not to flinch from dangerous 
questions. 

Mr. Thomas and I have been reading together the 
Impeachment in the State Tryals, and we find that all 
Nations are too much alike. 
My Family unite with me in presenting respects and assurances of old Regard to you and yours.

Dear Sir, — I have just now received your friendly 
Letter of the 19th. and rejoice with you sincerely in the 
Wellfare of your Family. I wish you had but named 
the Captain in the British Army who has been so fortunate as to marry your second daughter. Many of 
those officers are worthy Men, and you are much in the 
wrong to deplore her as lost to you, for Life. Neither 
Upper Canada nor England are so far off, but you may 
often hear from her, and much of her happiness. How 
many other daughters have you and what are their 
names ? John I doubt not will do well, and Richard 
with patience and perseverence indispensable in a Lawyer, sometimes and indeed commonly through a long 
Noviciate, will have no cause to fear. No civilized 
Societ)^ can do without Lawyers. 

Now for the first Part of your Letter. I have enjoyed 
as much health for the last four years as during any part 
of my Life : and my spirits have been as cheerfull as 
they ever were since some sin, to me unknown, involved me in Politicks. It must have been my own, 
for my father had certainly none towards me, and as 
little toward God or Man as any Man I ever knew 
in my Life. You hear I am still facetious upon some 
subjects. But my facetiousness you know was always awkward and seldom understood. When I was 
young I had two intimate Friends, Jonathan Sewall 
/ and Daniel Leonard — they both went away to England in 1775. These used to tell me I had a little 
capilary vein of satire, meandering about in my soul, 
and it broke out so strangely, suddenly and irregularly, 
that it was impossible ever to foresee when it would 
come or how it would appear. I have thought of this 
sometimes and have had reasons enough to do so. Certainly there is none of the Caustic of Juvenal in it : certainly none of the wit of Horace : and I fear little or 
none of his good nature or good humour. It is like 
Whitefords Punns. He made one once at my Table so 
extremely neat and pertinent but at the same time so 
far fetched, that it set the Table in a roar. Whiteford 
said I, how could you think of that ? it is so extremely 
remote and yet so exact, that I am sure I could not have 
found it in twenty years study. Lord, said he, I know 
not, I found it right before me. I stumbled on it, before 
I saw it It came of itself, I did not hunt it. At least 
in this I resemble Whiteford, the Cross Reader. I know 
/ nothing of any facetiousness in myself. If it is ever 
there it comes of itself, I hunt it not. You will expect 
from me the garrulity of narrative old age, and here 
you have it. 

Now for the latter part of your Letter. I resemble 
you and Sancho. I call for my Leavers and Iron Bars, 
for my Chissells, Drills and Wedges to split Rocks, and 
for my Waggons to cart Seaweed for manure upon my 
farm. I mount my Horse and ride on the sea shore : 
and I walk upon Mount WoUaston and Stonyfield Hill. 
Notwithstanding all this I read the public Papers and 
Documents, and I cannot and will not be indifferent 
to the Condition and Prospects of my Country. I love 
the People of America and believe them to be incapable 
of Ingratitude. They have been, they may be, and they 
are deceived. It is the Duty of Somebody to undeceive 
them. A Philosopher like Linnaeus might safely appeal 
to the Boys. But what are those to do who are to be tried 
by Boys on the Testimony of false Witnesses. Boys 
who are to have laid before them a Dozen VoUumes of 
lying Newspapers and Pamphlets edited annually for 
twenty, thirty or forty years together without any contradiction, and aggravated by as many more volumes of 
private Letters at least as lying as the Newspapers. 

An Appeal to the last day, eternal Justice and an 
assembled World, like Judge Chase, to be sure is perfect safety when it can be made. Although I have no 
doubt that able and upright Man could make it with 
sincerity as to his Integrity and good Intentions, yet I 
confess, for myself I should rather say at that Tribunal 
" God be merciful to me a sinner." Yet if called to 
such a Tryal as his I could do as he did, and I believe 
I should have done it. 

My Family join in friendly regards to yours, with 
your old 

Friend, and humble servant

Dear Sir, — I am highly gratified to possess so authentic an account of the several rising branches of your 
numerous and amiable Family, in whose welfare I feel 
so much Interest, that I ask your Permission to add my 
Benediction to yours. It is to me highly probable that 
those who have been carried Captive into the British 
Dominions, will succeed as well in Life, as those who 
may be destined to enjoy all the Honours, Glories and 
Felicities of our American Government in one Center 
and that Center the Nation. I hear the most respectable Testimonies of the arduous studies and uncommon 
Eloquence of your son Richard. But whether to congratulate you or him upon this subject I know not. It 
is very problematical whether Talents or Fame in this 
Country are desirable or not. 

I admire the Brilliancy of your Invention when asleep. 
I know not whether Esop or Phedrus or La Fontaigne, 
or Moore or Gay have given us a more ingenious Fable, 
than yours of the Man upon the Ball, of the steeple of 
Christ Church. The structure and application of the 
Fiction are very clear. But the Moral I cannot approve. I cannot quite reconcile it to Philosophy, Morality or Religion. When I was almost tempted to wish 
I could reconcile it to all that is good, I recollected unfortunately a pair of Couplets in Prior and began to 
doubt whether the Devil had not mounted on the Golden 
Ball instead of an angel of Light. 

The Truth is this : I cannot stav 
Flaring in sunshine all the Day: 
For entre nous, we hellish Sprites 
Love more the Frolic of the Nights ; 

And oftener our receipts convey 
In Dreams than any other Way. 

If however it were certain that no more Impression 
can be made upon Men, than was made upon the Wind 
and Weather by the Man upon the Ball, your Inference 
and conclusion would be logical. But when we know 
what Impressions have been made by Freeneau, Lloyd, 
Andrew Brown, Peter Markoe, Bache, Callender, Duane, 
Wood, Cheetham, Denniston, Ben Austin, Tom Paine 
and others of that stamp, shall we conclude that no Impression can be made in favour of Truth and Virtue by 
the popular Talents and scientifical attainments of Dr. 
Rush ? If so the Cause of Liberty is lost. 

Mistake me not however, my worthy Friend. It was far 
from my Intention in any Thing I have written to stimulate you to any exertions beyond your Inclination. You 
have done enough and suffered enough in the Cause of 
Liberty and Humanity. And unless your encouragements and Rewards had been greater, and unless your 
prospects of success were better you may fairly be excused. But **The Stirrs," in Pensylvania indicate the 
return of Zubly's Government, or rather the Franklinian 
System of a Government in one Center, which will be 
followed by other States. If I were a Painter I would 
sketch it. A splendid Coach drawn by six fiery 
Coursers, like those of Achilles, in full Gallop constantly lashed by a drunken Coachman, should start 
from the top of the Peak of Teneriff, down the steepest 
Pitch of the Mountain. The Gentlemen, Ladies and 
Children, of whom the Coach should be full should 
thrust their heads out of the windows before, behind 
and on each side, expressing in their Countenances the 

Passions of their hearts and especially their desire of 
leaping out, checked by the Horror of the Predpice. 
Remember ! there must be no Horses hitched on behind 
the Coach to draw up Hill, to check the progress to 
destruction. This would be too aristocratical. Perhaps it would be thought to give some Priviledge to 
Virtue, Talents, Courage, Industr)% Frugalit)" or even 
to ser\'ices, sufferings, sacrifices, or what is more 
horrible still to Propert}', Birth or Genius or Learning! 

Believe me, my Friend, a Government in one Center 
is as hostile to Law, Physick and Divinity, and even to 
Pen, Ink, Paper, Inkhoms, standishes, and even to reading and Cyphering as it is to Starrs and Garters, to 
Crown and Sceptres or any other exclusive Pri\41edges. 
It is content with no state of society that ever existed 
Negroes, Indians and Caffrarians cannot bear Democracj' any more than Bonaparte and Talleyrand. 

I thank you sir for your valuable Pamphlet on the 
effects of ardent spirits on soul and Body. I read it 
like all your other writings with much Pleasure and 
Profit 

My Family all join me in Love to you and yours. 

My Letter is shockingly written: because it was 
written in a hurr)\ You will excuse it 

From your respectful! Friend and Sen-'t 

<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">J. Adams</a>.

Your Letter, my dear Friend, of the 29th. of June, 
suggests enough of serious reflections to compose a 
longer reply than I am at present disposed to write, or 
than you could read with any satisfaction. 

John Ross, and I think some others, whom you have 
not mentioned, were in the Boat with us from Point no 
Point. I wish to ascertain if I could the Month and Day 
as well as the names of the Company. The Subject all 
the time, was Independence. It made an impression on 
me, because it seemed intended for my Instruction and 
edification. 

There is something in my Composition which restrains 
me from Rancour against any Man, with whom I have 
once lived in Friendship. Mr. McKean, is one, among 
many of my old Friends, who have been separated from 
me by political Causes. I cannot rejoice at the embarrassment he is in, or the humiliation that seems to be 
preparing for him. He is one of the last Men in the 
United States who could consistendy with his Principles 
or disposition, throw himself into the Arms of a Democratic faction. It will be very curious, if Duane should 
appear to be an overmatch for him, and his Friends. 
Yet even this may happen in Pensilvania. McKean, 
Dallas and Coxe are not at home in the democratical 
pallace. They must be ejected from that House of 
Pride, as Spencer describes it, or the House will be 
divided against itself. 

I have not seen an Aurora a long time : but last 
night I was told that in the late Papers of Mr. Duane, 
he or his writers, are elaborately answering my Defence, 
and recommending a Government in one assembly. 

This coincides with your account that the old errors on 
the subject of Government Learning and Lawyers are 
revived. There is a Body of People in every State in 
the Union, who are both in heart and head of this sect 
This Tribe will always be courted by the seekers of 
Popularity and opposers of a good systematick Government. They are properly the Sansculottes of this Country. Whoever courts them and builds upon them, will 
find himself in the situation of Danton, who made two 
speeches on the subject, which reveal the whole Mystery. ** They now cry Danton and Robespierre," said 
he, " but the moment they change the order and cry 
Vive Robespierre and Danton, off goes my head." 
Another saying of Danton was this, ** They have driven 
us into the arms of the Sansculottes ; and Sansculottism has destroyed France ; it has ruined us all, and will 
very soon destroy itself Danton however was not 
the first nor the last Demagogue who has gone down 
into the Pit with his eyes open. 

It would indeed seem as if Mankind were destined 
to be slaves, as you tell me I said 30 years ago. All 
History and all experience seem to evince such a tendency. There is Liberty, however, and there has been 
in some ages and Countries ; and if this fact is admitted, wise Men should never despair, but always remember that no effort will be lost. When I said ** the sooner 
they fulfill their Destiny the better,'' I said as peevish and 
extravagant a thing as Brutus did, when he said he 
found Virtue but a shadow, though he had worshipped 
her all his days as a Goddess. Such foolish escapes of 
ill humour ought not to be remembered : or if not forgotten they ought to be reprobated. 

Pennsylvania is not alone. Every State in the Union is in her case, in a larger or smaller degree. Patriotism 
in this Country must be tinctured with English or french 
devotion, or be without support, and almost without 
friends. Independent, unadulterated, impartial Americanism is like Hayleys Old Maid, a decayed Tree in a 
vast desert plain of sand, or like Burkes old oak, torn 
up by the roots and laid prostrate by the late hurricane. 
Every State in the Union has a Party, like your " old 
wealthy native Citizens," who are still Englishmen in 
their hearts, and will afford a mere American no support. These factions from the Mississippi to St. Croix, 
have made it a fixed Principle all along to hunt down 
every true American and every Revolutionary Character, as soon as they possibly could, and get them out of 
the way. They were all in one of these Parties taught 
to turn their eyes, for this purpose upon that Scottish 
Creole Alexander Hamilton as their head, and what he 
was to do with them or what they were to do with him 
I will not at present conjecture, but I have an opinion 
which may one day be develloped. Probably it went 
no further than an alliance with England, and an alienation from France, without well considering what must 
have been the necessary effect of such a Plan. In this 
they fundamentally departed from my system, and my 
Maxim which you know I have preached and inculcated 
for thirty years and which Jefferson has been mean 
enough to steal from me and display as his own, " Friendship and Commerce with all Nations, alliances with 
none." Washington learned it from me too, as you very 
well know, and practised upon it, as far as he could, to my 
certain knowledge and by my constant advice at a time 
when he consulted me in every thing, to the infinite 
Jealousy of Hamilton. Your Lady's Father Judge 
Stockton, knew very well that this was my Maxim on 
the day of the vote of Independence, and his son 
Horatio seems to have heard it from his Father. For 
he wrote with more Cognizance de cause, at a certain 
critical Period, than any other writer in America. Even 
he however was too fulsome to Washington. I am 
always mortified when I see my administration supported 
by the Name, Opinion or authority of that Man, great 
and good as he certainly was. If my Conduct cannot 
be justified by Reason, Justice and the public good, 
without the smallest aid from the Prejudices or Caprices 
of the People, or from the Judgment of any single Individual on Earth, I pray that it may be condemned. 

The human understanding is very well in the ordinary 
affairs of Life. In Architecture, Men consider the elements about them, the earth, the air, the water and the 
fire, and construct their houses very well to guard 
against the Dangers and Inconveniences of each. In 
Dress, in Furniture, in Equipage, they consult nature 
tolerably well, and provide for their Comfort and Decency. But in Government they seem to be destitute 
of common sense. The Nature of Men and Things is 
laid out of the Question. Experiment which is admitted 
in all other Arts and Sciences, is wholly unheeded in 
this. A strange Disposition prevails, throughout all 
stages of Civilization, to live in Hollow Trees, and Log 
Houses without Chimneys or Windows, without any 
division of the Parlour from the Kitchen, or the Garret 
from the Cellar. 

I cheerfully agree to confine your Letter to my family 
upon condition that you confine mine to yours. For 
mercy sake dont hint any thing from me to Tench Coxe 
or Tom Paine, to Pierpoint Edwards or Dr. Dana. 
My Family join in Love to yours, with your old

My dear old Friend, — Your favour of the 14th. 
gives an exact Analysis of Pennsylvania and its Parties : 
and from it a probability results, that the old Constitution will be revived. But for what reason do you call 
it Dr. Franklins? I always understood it to be the 
work of Cannon, Matlock, Young and. Paine, and that 
Franklin, though President of the Convention, had no 
greater hand in its fabrick than the painted head of a 
Ship has in her Pilotage and navigation. 

I remember to have heard, that during my absence 
from Congress, either before its departure from Phyladelphia in 1777 or after its arrival in <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, motions 
were made by R. H. Lee and Mr. Samuel Adams, for 
sending fresh Instructions to Dr. Franklin, Mr. Deane 
and Mr. Arthur Lee, authorizing them to offer to the 
French Court some additional articles of alliance, warranty or Priviledges in trade, which at my Instance had 
been carefully avoided in the Plan of the Treaty and in 
the first Instructions. I should be very much obliged 
to you, if you can recollect and write me the particulars. 

I am extreamly sorry you relinquished your design 
of writing Memoirs of the American Revolution. The 
burning of your Documents was, let me tell you, a very 
rash action, and by no means justifiable upon good Principles. Truth, Justice and Humanity are of eternal 
obligation, and we ought to preserve the evidence, 
which can alone support them. I do not intend to let 
every Lye impose upon Posterity. 

You rank Colonel Hamilton among the Revolutionary 
Characters. But why? The Revolution had its beginning, its middle and its end before he had any thing to 
do in public affairs, Col. Reed, Col. Harrison and Mr. Edmund Randolph were Secretaries to General Washington before Hamilton was in his Family, as an aid du 
camp or scribe. I never knew that such a Man or Boy 
was in his suite, nor did I ever hear the Name of Hamilton, till after the evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> this Boy 
came forward a bawling advocate for the Tories. Then 
Smith, Humphreys and Hamilton were first talked of as 
aids. They were all advocates for the Tories, and 
honorably and justly so because the Tories had clear 
rights to the stipulations of the Treaty of Peace. Hamiltons zeal in their favour procured him their votes and 
Interest not only in the city of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> but all over 
the Continent as long as he lived. He quitted the Army 
for a long time as I have heard, in a Pet and a Miff with 
Washington. Great Art has been used to propagate 
an opinion that Hamilton was the Writer of Washingtons best Letters and most popular addresses ; especially that to the Governors of the States on his resignation of the Command of the Army. This I know to be 
false. It was the joint production of Col. Humphries 
and another Gentleman a better writer and more judicious Politician, whom I will not name at present. 

The Revolution began in strict exactness from the 
surrender of <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'><a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a></a> in 1759. It took a gloomy and 
dreadful form in 1761, so as to convince me at least 
that it would be inevitable. It continued to 1776 when 
on the fourth of July it was completed. The Part we 
acted from 1761 to 1776 was more difficult, more dangerous and more disagreable than all that happened 
afterwards till the Peace of 1783. I know therefore 
of no fair tide that Hamilton has to a revolutionary 
Character. 

You say that Washington and Hamilton are idolized 
by the Tories. Hamilton is : Washington is not To 
speak the Truth they puffed Washington like an air 
balloon to raise Hamilton into the air. Their Preachers^ 
their orators, their Pamphlets and Newspapers have 
spoken out and avowed publickly since Hamiltons 
death, what I verj' well knew to be in their hearts for 
many years before, viz : that Hamilton was e\'er)' Thing 
and Washington but a Name. Even as our Massachusetts Democrats have last vear been left to acknowledge that Mr. Handcock was a Cypher and Mr. Sullivan 
the figure. Both wnth as much falshood as ingratitude. 

The ''quantum profuisti de fabula Christi" of Leo 
the tenth which you apply to the funding sj-stem with 
so much ingenuit)', I cannot think applicable with strict 
Justice. I know not how Hamilton could have done 
otherwise. To be sure it was a very lucrative turn of 
afiairs to some People. Hamiltons Talents have been 
gready exaggerated. His knowledge of the great subjects of Coin and Commerce, and their intimate Connection with all Departments of every Government, 
especially such as are so elective as ours, was very 
superfidal and imperfecL He had derived most of his 
Information from Duer, who Ti-as a Brother in Law of 
Mr. Rose, the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under 
Mr. Pitt. Duer had been long Secretary- to the Board 
of Treasury-. Lee, Osgood and Livingston were all 
Men of Abilities and kept the Books of the Treasury 
in good order. Duer became assistant Secretary of 
the Treasury to Hamilton. Our old Treasury under 
the old Congress, had its Register, its Auditor, &amp;c., so 
that little alteration was made besides abolishing the 
Board and placing a Secretar}' in its stead Wolcotts 
indefatigable Industr}' with a seven years experience at 
the Connecticutt Pay Table, came in aid of Hamilton 
and Duer. So that I see no extraordinar)^ reason for 
so much exclusive Glorj- to Hamilton. I have never 
had but one opinion of Banks. One National Bank 
with a Branch for each State, the whole inexorably 
limited to ten or fifteen millions of Dollars, is the utmost length the which my Judgment can go. The Army 
was none of my Work. I only ad\ised a few Companies 
of Artillery to garrison our most exposed forts that a 
single frigate, or Picaroon Privateer might not take 
them at the first assault. Hamiltons Project of an Army 
of fifty thousand Men, ten thousand of them to be 
horse, appeared to me to be proper only for Bedlam. 
His Friends however in Senate and the House embarassed me with a Bill for more Troops than I wanted. 

When I first took the Chair I was extreamly desirous of availing myself of Mr. Madisons abilities, experience, 
Reputation and amiable qualities. But the violent Party Spirit of Hamiltons Friends, jealous of ever}'' Man who 
possessed qualifications to eclipse him, prevented it I could not do it without quarrelling outright with my 
Ministers, whom Washingtons appointment had made my Masters, and I gave it up. Yet Hamilton himself 
intrigued in a curious manner, which I may perhaps explain hereafter, if you desire it 

Colonel Burr is another, whom I was desirous of making a Brigadier General. I proposed it to Washington, who said he had reason to believe that Burr 
would make a good officer : but the question was whether he would not be too good at Intrigue. I have reason to believe, that Washington proposed it to 
Hamilton and that he prevented it. My Reason for this belief I will also give you if you wish to know it. Upon second thought, as I have paper enough I may as 
well tell you now. Col. Burr, visited me at Phyladelphia as he always did when he came near me, and asked me whether I had authorized Hamilton to propose to him 
an appointment in the Army. As I never had mentioned or suggested the Idea to Hamilton, I answered No. Burr said that Hamilton had frequently of late 
asked him what he thought of an appointment, and whether he could cordially cooperate with Washington. Burr said he answered that he despized Washington, 
as a Man of no Talents, and one who could not spell a sentence of common English. I reproved Burr for this 
sally and said his Prejudices made him very unreasonable : for to my certain Knowledge Washington was not so illiterate. Burr said he was determined the first 
time he saw me, to ask me whether Hamilton had been moved by me, or whether his questions to him were insidious. I explained nothing to Burr and he knows not 
to this day, that I ever mentioned him or thought of him for an appointment. My Conclusion is however that Washington had mentioned it to Hamilton, but his 
Jealousy of Burr would not allow him to consent. 

Affections between the Families as usual. Injunctions will be observed.

Dear Sir, — Although it is a gratification to my feelings to write to you and a much greater Pleasure to receive a Letter from you ; yet I have no desire to give 
you any trouble, or the least anxiety on my account when your answer is delayed. I know your avocations and respect them. No Apology is ever necessary for any 
pause in our Correspondence. 

The Journals of Congress afford litde light, in develloping the real History of the years 1774, 1775, 1776 
and 1777. By the contrivance of a secret Journal, and 
another refinement of a third more select and sublimated still, the most important motions and their movers 
are still concealed from the public, and some of them 
will never be known. In a Letter I wrote to Judge 
Chase dated <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> July 9. 1776, I find these words 
"Your motion last fall, for sending Ambassadors to France, with conditional instructions, was murdered, terminating in a committee of secret correspondence, which came to nothing." 

The Truth is, that in consequence of many conversations and consultations between Mr. Chase and me, he 
made a Motion in Congress in the fall of the year 1 775 
for sending Ambassadors to France. I seconded his 
Motion. You know the State of the Nerves of Congress at that time. Although you was not then a 
Member, you had opportunities enough to have felt the 
Pulse of that Body. Whether the effect of the motion 
resembled the shock of Electricity, of Mesmerism or of 
Galvanism, the most exactly, I leave you Philosophers 
to determine. But the Grimaces, the agitations and 
convulsions were very great. Knowing the composition of Congress at that time, you will be at no loss to 
conjecture the parts which were taken in the debate, 
which ensued, which was very vehement. It was a 
measure which I had long contemplated, and as I then 
thought and have confidently believed from that time to 
this, well digested. The Principle of Foreign Affairs 
which I then advocated, has been the invariable guide 
of my conduct, in all situations, as Ambassador in 
France, Holland and England, and as Vice President 
and President of the United States, from that hour to 
this. It was indeed my unchangeable adherence to this 
principle, that turned those whom you call Tories, and 
which the Bostonians call Essex Junto against me 
in the election of 1800. This Principle was that we 
should make no Treaties of Allyance with any European 
Power : that we should consent to none but Treaties of 
Commerce : that we should separate ourselves as far as 
possible, and as long as possible from all European 
Politicks and Wars. 

In discussing the variety of motions which were made 
as substitutes for Mr. Chase's I was remarkably cool, 
and for me unusually eloquent. On no occasion before 
or after did I ever make a greater Impression on Congress. Caesar Rodney told me, I had opened an entire 
new field to his view, and removed all his difficulties 
concerning foreign Connections. Mr. Duane said to 
me ",We all give you great Credit for that speech, and 
we all agree that you have more fully considered and 
better digested the subject of foreign Connections than 
any Man we have ever heard speak upon the subject." 
Although Mr. Dickinson was then offended with me 
on account of an intercepted Letter, and never spoke 
to me personally, yet I was told that Mr. Dickinson was highly pleased with my sentiments on for^[n af&amp;irs. 

All this you will call Vanity and Egrotism. Such indeed it is. But Jefferson and Hamilton, ought not to 
steal from me mv eood Name, and robb me of the 
reputation of a system which I was bom to introduce, refin'd it first and shew'd its use, as reallv as Dean Swift did Ironv. 

After all our arcnimentation however, we could not 
carr\- our Motion : but after twenty subde projects to 
get rid of it the whole terminated in a Committee of 
Secret Correspondence. When the Ballots were taken, 
not one of the Committee was from the Eastern States. 
Franklin, Dickinson, Jay, &amp;c., were elected. On the 
same evening or the next Mr. Jay came to my Lodgings at Mrs. Yards, came up to my Chamber and said he 
came on purpose to take a pipe with me. He accordingly spent the whole evening with me over a bottle of 
wine, and many pipes of tobacco. He seemed to me 
to be apprehensive of ill Consequences, from the result 
of Mr. Chase's motion, and particularly apologized for 
mv not beinor on the Committee. I told him I had no 
more pretensions than others to be upon the Committee and had no particular desire of it. But I thought it 
extraordinarv that no Member from the Massachusetts 
nor indeed from New England was elected, and I could 
not account for it Indeed it appeared to me alarming, 
and indicated a spirit of Intrigue, and a manoeuvre of 
Part\', thar must injure the common cause. Mr. Jav said 
I was rio^ht and it was a thingr that ouofht to be explained. He added "You would undoubtedly have 
been chosen, but for one reason. Your Reputation is 

very high in Congress. To my Knowledge nothing 
prevents you from being universally acknowledged to 
be the first Man in Congress, but your known intimate 
Connection with two Gentlemen, Samuel Adams and 
Richard Henry Lee. Congress is divided and parties 
are high, and these two Men have been the cause of it." 
I answered that I had no pretension to be thought the 
first Man in Congress, nor if I had the clearest title to 
it, should I choose to have it acknowledged. There was 
too much danger in it of all sorts. That Mr. Adams 
and Mr. Lee were very intimate friends, because they 
were able and zealous friends of their Country, and 
surely I could not relinquish my friendship for them, for 
the sake of acquiring any reputation, or Influence whatever. You know I presume that the Virginians always 
had a pique against R. H. Lee, and among the secret 
Motives that produced Parties, Combinations and Intrigues in Congress and the army too, I know of none 
that had greater effect. 

Long after this came the Motion for a Committee to 
prepare a plan of a Treaty to be offered to France. I 
was of this Committee and drew up the plan. I carefully excluded every Idea of Alliance : and reported a 
mere Treaty of Commerce. This occasioned debate 
and even my friends R. H. Lee and Samuel Adams 
differed from me in opinion. They thought France 
would have no Motive to treat with us and proposed 
and Warrantees. • I opposed them ; and prevailed ; and Franklin sailed for France with only a 
Treaty of Commerce in his Portfolio. I constantly asserted that any Thing like a Treaty of Alliance would 
make us forever the Sport of the Politicks of the 
Cabinetts of Europe : whereas our Duty and Interest 



8a OZP ^,<mizy zet^e^s.="" lk="">th would exact irom us a perfect Neutrality in all 
luiix&gt;pean Wars at least as lon^^ as the European Powers 
would pennit it. If any one of them should force a 
War upon us, we must meet it like Men ; but we should 
avoid it with the utmost caution and anxiety. 

My opinion of the French Revolution has never 
varit*d frotu the Hrst assembly of the Notables to this 
hour. 1 always dreadevi iu and never had any faith in 
its sucv^ess or utility, h has carried Europe forward 
with rapid steps to the Fate of Sodom and Gomorrow, 
Tyrt* and Svvloii in its Course to Barbarity. 

My I'Viend Hrissol has recorded a Conversation he 
held with me at my House in Grosvenor Square which 
1 esteem as a Trophy, He says and says truly thatl 
told him the FrtM\ch Nation were not capable of a free 
(.iovernment. and tlvit they had no risjht or Cause to 
enj^ge in a Revolution, By this I did not mean that a 
Nation has not a ri^^ht to alter tiie Government, to 
change a Pvnastv or institute a new Constitution in the 
place of an old one : for no Man is clearer on these 
pointii than 1 am : but 1 know that the Nation was not 
disposcvl to a Revolution, and that it never could be 
ma*.le a national Act : as in&lt;,iee*.l it never was. I knew 
the Men and the Families who were at the bottom of 
it The Rochetaucaults. the Noailles. the Le Moinons» 
and Orleans with their satelites no: one Man of whom 
knew what he w"as about. 

I rejoice that you do not ^.les^xiir, A Pendulum that 
vibrates seconds must vibrate half a second one Way 
before it can return to vibrate the other, I will not 
give any opinion whether it is advisable to stop the 
watch, or let it run on. I pity McKean. He has 
sinned and has been sinned aj^unst. Many curious 
and instructive Anecdotes might be told. He was 
carried away with the french revolution, and he paid 
too much court to Dallas, Gallatin, and others of that 
stamp. But on the other hand he was not fairly treated 
by the Federalists. I say no more at present. 

Moreau's opinion of Bonaparte, that he possesses 
consummate military abilities, will not be disputed. 
Macedonias Madman or the Sweed will not be his 
Rival. His Wife, gave him his Character, as truly as 
Moreau. "The Child of Mars and of Fortune." 
Great Talents, great qualities and great Luck will not 
be denied him. But hereafter he will be thought on 
many occasions headlong and rash in full proportion to 
his other great qualities. 

I am fully convinced that the yellow fever sometimes 
and indeed often is generated in many places in America, 
especially in our great Cities, by natural Causes of 
putrefaction, but not yet quite clear that it is not contagious and frequently imported. I therefore as David 
Hume said of himself in Paris, dine with the Dinnerites 
and sup with the Supperites. I am for cleansing the 
Cities with all possible Industry, and at the same time, 
for maintaining the Quarantine Laws, to keep it out from 
abroad. At the same time I must confess my total Incapacity to judge in this Case, for want of experience 
and Theory too : and therefore that my opinion is not 
worth any thing : I would say were not worth a Rush, 
if it were not a most detestable punn. 

The Class of People in your State, who oppose you, 
have always adopted a Principle to oppose to the utmost of their Power every Man who had any conspicuous share in the Revolution. The similar Class in every 
State acts on the same Principle. Hence the universal 
agreement, and strenuous exertions of that Class to 
ascribe the whole Revolution to Washington, and the 
whole Federal Government to Hamilton. 

If my little political Anecdotes are interesting to your 
son Richard of whom I have conceived high hopes, he 
shall have as many more as he pleases. 

When the office of Treasurer of the Mint was vacant, 
I had, as nearly as I recollect about forty applications 
for it. I never had more difficulty in examining and 
comparing testimonies, qualifications, merits, &amp;c., in 
order to determine conscientiously in my own Mind, 
whom to nominate. After the most serious deliberation, and weighing every Mans pretensions I concluded 
to give the office to Dr. Rush who had not applied for 
it. Among the solicitors for this twelve hundred dollars 
a year was the Honorable Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg, who wrote me a Letter with his own hand, signed 
with his name, beseeching me to give it him. He sometime before wrote me a Letter, requesting that I would 
nominate him to some suitable appointment without 
specifying any. I was desirous of obliging him, I 
pittied his Situation, and I was very sensible of the 
Policy of attaching the Germans to the national Government. 

During the half War with France, General Peter 
Muhlenbourg applied to me directly for a Commission 
in the Army and expressly said he would make no conditions or difficulties about Rank. I concluded from 
this that General Muhlenbourg was convinced of the 
Justice and necessity of the War, and I would have 
been verj^ happy to have appointed him notwithstanding 
his Party in Politicks. Accordingly I proposed him to 
General Washington, who allowed him to be a good 

officer. But I was only Vice Roy under Washington 
and he was only Vice Roy under Hamilton and Hamilton was Vice Roy under the Tories as you call them 
and Peter Muhlenbourg was not appointed. 

Against the appointment of Augustus there were 
such remonstrances made to me and such representations of instances of his then late Misconduct and Dishonesty, that I dared not appoint him. 

Now let me propose to your son Richard, a political 
Theorem or two for his solution. 

1. If Washington had seen as I did, and consented 
to the appointment of Coll. Burr, as a Brigadier in the 
Army, a rank and command he would have eagerly 
accepted for he was then in great humiliation and near 
dispair, what would at this hour have been the situation 
of the United States? Would the Manhattan Bank 
have ever been founded ? Would the momentary union 
of the Livingstons and Clintons have ever been formed ? 
Would the State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> have been democrified 
so ? Would not the Federal Candidates have had the 
unanimous votes of the Electors for that State ? 

2. If I had appointed Augustus Muhlenberg, Treasurer of the Mint, or Peter, a Brigadier in the Army, 
would Augustus have united with Tench Coxe at Lancaster in that impudent and insolent address to the 
Public, with their Names in which I was so basely 
slandered and belied? If the Germans had been 
gratified with appointments of these their Leaders, 
would not the Electors of Pensilvania have been all 
Federal ? and consequently the Federal cause tryumphant ? 

The Case of Cooper and Priestly another time. 

As I have quoted a Letter to Judge Chase, and as 
Richard loves political curiosities I will send a Copy of 
the whole Letter. 

I doubt the exact verity of your sons oration, when 
he says that ** time never fails to do Justice to the Benefactors of Mankind." Unless he means in Kingdom to 
come. 

With usual good will, yours &amp;c., 

<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">J. Adams</a>.

P.S. — I admire Bonaparte's expression "The Scenery 
of the Business." 

The Scenery has often if not commonly in all the 
Business of human Life, at least of Public Life, more 
effect, than the Characters of the Dramatis Persona^ 
or the Ingenuity of the Plott. Recollect within your 
own times. What but the scenery did this? or that? 
or the other ? Was there ever a Coup de Theatre, that 
had so great an effect as Jeffersons Penmanship of the 
Declaration of Independence ? Or as Gages exception 
from Pardon of Mr. J. Adams and Mr. Hancock? Or 
Hamiltons demand upon pain of a Pamphlet of the 
command in the attack of the Redoubt at Yorktown ? 
Or Burrs Enterprise with Arnold up the River Kennebeck? I have a great mind to write a Book on "the 
Scenery of the Business." You could write another 
much sooner and much better. 

I know not Major Butlers evidence of his opinion, 
but it is new to me, and the most probable I have ever 
heard. 

Dr. Benjamin Rush.

Dear Sir, — I am half inclined to be very angry with 
you for destroying the Anecdotes and Documents you 
had collected for private Memoirs of the American 
Revolution. From the Memoirs of Individuals, the 
true springs of events and the real motives of actions 
are to be made known to Posterity. The Period in the 
History of the World the best understood, is that of 
Rome from the time of Marius to the Death of Cicero, 
and this distinction is entirely owing to Ciceros Letters and orations. There we see the true character of 
the times and the Passions of all the Actors on the 
Stage. Cicero, Cato and Brutus were the only three, 
in whom I can discern any real Patriotism. The two 
last were honest in the main, but with great aberrations 
at times, and neither of them very able. Cicero had 
the most Capacity and the most constant as well as the 
wisest and most persevering attachment to the Republick. Almost fifty years ago I read Middletons Life of 
this Man, with great pleasure and some advantage. 
Since that time I have been more conversant in his 
writings as well as in the other writers and  General History of that Period. Within a month past I have 
read Middletons Life of him again, and with more pleasure because with more understanding than before. I 
seem to read the History of all ages and Nations in 
every Page, and especially the History of our own 
Country for forty years past. Change the Names and 
every Anecdote will be applicable to us. I said I read 
with pleasure ; but it was a melancholly pleasure. I 
know of no more melancholly Books than SuUys 
Memoirs and Cicero's Life. 
The Tryumvirate of Caesar, Pompey and Crassus, 
and the other of Octavius, Anthony and Lepidus, the 
first formed by Caesar and the last by Octavius for the 
purpose of worming themselves into Empire, their Shifts 
and Turns, their Intrigues and Cabals have analogy 
enough with Hamiltons schemes, to get rid of Washington, Adams, Jay and Jefferson, and monopolize all 
Power to himself. You may introduce Burr and McKean 
and Clinton into the speculation if you please, and even 
Mr. Madison. You may pursue the subject if you think 
fit, — I have not patience for it. You inquire what passed 
between W. and Hamilton at <a href='/results.php?city=york town' rel='city'>York Town</a> ? Washington had ordered or was about to order another officer 
to take the Command of the Attack upon the Redoubt. Hamilton flew into a violent Passion and 
demanded the command of the Party for himself and 
declared if he had it not, he would expose  General Washingtons Conduct in a Pamphlet. Thus you see 

Its proper power to hurt each Creature feels 
Bulls aim their horns, and asses lift their heels. 

Hamiltons Instruments of offence were Libels, not true 
Libels according to the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> Doctrine, but lying 
Libells. 

The storming of a Redoubt by a Boy, was to be the 
Coup de Theatre or the Scenery of the Business, to 
make him afterwards Commander in Chief of the Army 
and President of Congress, though there is no more 
qualification for either in storming a redoubt, than there 
would have been in killing a Deer in the Woods. The 
one proved him a good Partisan the other would have 
gained him the Reputation of a good shot : but neither 
would fit him to command armies or govern States. 
I rejoice in your Prosperity and wish it may increase. 
If you have sold the Copy right of your Medical Works 
for a thousand dollars, I am confident the Bookseller 
will have a good Bargain and make twice the profit of 
it, that you will. Those works are in universal esteem 
among the Faculty, and even those who differ from you 
on so many points. 

There is a concurrence, if not a combination of events 
that strikes me. Coll. Burr at Washington,  General Dayton at Washington, General Miranda at Washington, General Hull returning from his Government, 
General Wilkinson commanding in Louisiana &amp;c., &amp;c. 
Enterprises of great Pith may be in a State of Coction. 
You may say perhaps that I am jealous. But there is 
a long History in my memory attached to several of 
those names, which suggests the Possibility of profound 
Councils and great Results, whether good or bad I will 
not conjecture. If our Government should risque the 
giving offence to France by a war with Spain, I should 
be surprised. 

If I have been as tedious in this Letter as in my last, 

I will not be so long, lest I should disgust you with a 

Correspondence which affords great pleasure to your 

Friend and humble servant

Dear Sir, — The new edition of your medical works, 
mentioned in your favour of the sixth of this month, 
have been committed to Mr. Shaw my Nephew whom 
you know, and will be sent to me from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> in due 
time. Many of those compositions I have read and 
shall read again with much pleasure, and shall make 
them as generally useful as I can among the Physicians 
in my Neighbourhood : but as I feel as few as I ever did 
in my life of those Aches and pains which you say await 
me and I know must come, I will not anticipate them. 
Sufficient for the day is its own evil. 

I never had the good fortune to meet General Miranda 
nor the pleasure to see him. I have heard much of his 
abilities and the politeness of his manners. But who is 
he ? What is he ? Whence does he come and whither 
does he go ? What are his motives, views and objects ? 
Secrecy, Mystery and intrigue, have a mighty effect on 
the World. You and I have seen it in Franklin, Washington, Burr, Hamilton and Jefferson and many others. 
The Judgment of Mankind in general is like that of 
father Bonhours, who says " For myself, I regard secret 
persons, like the great rivers, whose bottoms we cannot see and which make no noise ; or like those vast 
forests, whose silence fills the soul, with I know not 
what religious horror. I have for them the same admiration, as men had for the oracles, which never suffered themselves to be understood, till after the event 
of things ; or for the <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> of God, whose conduct 
is impenetrable to the human mind.'* 

Without criticising the taste, the piety or decency of 
comparing a man, successively to a river, a forest, an 
oracle, and providence, I shall only say that I never had 
tliis silence, nor aimed at having it ; nor the admiration 
of it, of Bonhours ; whose images however, scarcely 
express too boldly, the stupid wonder of the world, 
which is, excited by it. This quality when well managed, 
I have known to be worth more to a Man than ten 

Talents. It must nevertheless be acknowledged, there 
are times and cases, in which our Duty to God our 
Neighbour and ourselves, renders a total silence and an 
impenetrable secrecy indispensable. I have practised 
it myself when I thought it necessary, with as much 
vigour as any of them: but never for the purpose 
of giving myself an air of Grandeur, Depth or importance. 

In all my communications to Congress and to my 
friends while I was a public minister abroad, I held the 
same language with Miranda, that we had nothing to 
hope from England or France, but what we should be 
obliged to repay with Interest. And that has been my 
invariable opinion from that time to this. I am ashamed 
indeed that so many of my Countrymen entertain hopes 
of great Things from both ; some from one and some 
from the other. I see not however with Miranda, that 
we have anything to fear from either. If our Negotiations are conducted with skill we need not be afraid. 
But from the Blunders of such Men as C. Pinkney, 
Monroe, Armstrong and Livingston, we can never 
know what is to come. 

Whether Mr. Pitt has any thoughts of destroying the 
remains of Liberty in England or not, I neither know 
nor much Care. Believing him as I do an able Minister, I think he has too much sense ; but if he has not, 
it will make little difference to me or my Country, or 
Mankind. If he tries the experiment he will only ruin 
himself, and that is nothing to me. 

I think with Miranda, we shall have no war. No 
thanks however to the wisdom of our negotiations ; and 
I fear we shall be weakly obliged to pay for peace by 
the sacrifice of our commerce and by purchasing at a 
great expense more causes of European Jealousy and 
more objects of Contention. 

Miranda's anecdote of Hamiltons scorn of Washington is no surprise to me. Those who trumpetted Washington in the highest strains at some times, spoke of 
him at others, in the strongest terms of contempt 
Indeed I know of no Character to which so much 
hypocritical adulation has been offered. Hamilton, 
Pickering and many others, have been known to indulge themselves in very contemptuous expressions, 
but very unjustly and ungratefully. His Character as 
an able General, a wise Statesman and an honest Man, 
is justly established, with the present age and Posterity, 
beyond the reach of those railers and all who resemble 
them in self Conceit and ill nature. The History with 
which Hamilton threatened to destroy the Character of 
Washington, might diminish some of that enthusiastic 
exaggeration which represents him as the greatest 
General, the greatest Legislator, and the most perfect 
Character that ever lived ; but could never take from 
him the praise of Talents and Virtues labours and exertions, which will command the esteem of the wisest 
and best Men in all ages. 

Although I read with tranquility and suffered to pass 
without animadversion in silent contempt, the base 
insinuations of vanity, and a hundred lies besides 
published in a Pamphlet against me, by an insolent 
coxcomb, who rarely dined in good Company where 
there was good wine, without getting silly, and vapouring about his administration, like a young Girl about her 
brilliants and trinketts ; yet I loose all Patience, when 
I think of a bastard brat of a Scotch Pedler, daring to 
threaten to undeceive the world in their Judgment of 
Washington, by writing a history of his battles and 
Campaigns. This Creature was in a delirium of ambition ; he had been blown up with Vanity by the Tories, 
had fixed his eye on the highest station in America, and 
he hated every Man young or old who stood in his way, 
or could in any manner eclipse his laurells or rival his 
Pretensions, Col. Smith, Coll. Burr, Mr. Jay, Mr. Madison, Adams, Mr. Jefferson and Washington were but a 
part of those who were envied by him. From some 
windows in my House I see, the Capitol in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ; not 
only its dome and steeple, but the whole body of the 
Building: from other windows the view is obstructed 
by Trees, Houses &amp;c., in other Mens lands, and there 
might be Pallaces and Temples. If I should swear I 
would cutt down all those Trees and burn all those 
sacred Temples and gorgeous Palaces, in order to clear 
my view and actually attempt and accomplish some of 
this destruction, I should be an emblem of the Bairn of 
Nevis. 

The sudden rise of the public securities, after the establishment of the funding system, was no misfortune 
to the Public, but an advantage. The necessity of that 
system arose from the inconsistency of the People, in 
contracting debts and then refusing to pay them. The 
States would not adopt the five per Cent impost, and 
there were no means of paying the interest or principal 
of the public debt That obstinate and willfull ignorance of the nature of money, and of public Credit, 
which suffered the depreciation of the Continental 
Currency, effected a similar depreciation of the public 
certificates, and is now inforcing a depreciation of the 
only Currency we have, the bank bills ; and when or 
how this element of confusion will stop, I know not. 
Experience is lost upon our People. The Injustice occasioned by these Bills, will be as great, for any thing 
I can see, as that which arose from Paper Money, or 
the public Certificates. The Government of the Nation 
and of individual States will have their hands full of 
business to prevent greater evils from this, than arose 
from the other two causes. 

I have no objection to the respects shewn to Moreau 
and am pleased with those to Eaton and Decatur: but 
I mourn over the neglect of Talbot, Truxton, Litde 
and Decatur the Father. Our Statesmen committed a 
most egregious, pernicious, and indeed malicious Error, 
in discouraging those officers, and mismanaging the 
ships. But democratical ambition and vengeance, will 
never act with more Wisdom, Morality or Decency. 

I feel more interested in our public affairs now, than 
I have for some years, because we seem to be in some 
immediate danger. The Public ought to know more 
than they do about our negotiations with England, 
Spain and France too. If our disputes and difficulties 
have been brought upon us, by the imprudence of our 
Ambassadors, or by the Impolicy of our Government 
in contending for Points, which can never be obtained 
and if obtained would be of no value, we ought to 
know it. But if our Government and Ministers are 
not in fault and our Commerce is like to be destroyed, 
as much as I love Neutrality, I would let our Merchants 
make reprisals. 

You will be surprised to find this much ado about 
nothing closed by a question in natural History. Has 
the Plant that is called by the name of Soda, by some 
writers. Kali, by others and Barilla, perhaps by more, 
ever been discovered in this Countr)^? It is named 
Glasswort too, I believe by the English. I am dear Sir 

as usual, with usual regards from my Family to yours,

Dear Sir, — Your favour of the fifteenth is received. 
In a cornfield, which I had manured with seaweed and 
Marsh mud, in a compost with other materials, I found, 
last fall, two plants of an uncommon appearance which 
I suspected to be the Kali : because they resembled the 
descriptions of it which I had read in the Dictionary of 
natural History and in the QEconomical Dictionary, both 
of which quote Monsieur De Reaumur and many other 
original authorities. I had before seen several of these 
plants, springing up on banks of mud, which I had 
thrown upon the sides of the Ditches which I had made 
in my salt Marshes. It was late in the fall when I perceived them. The pods and seeds were dead and dried, 
so that I could not be certain that it was the Plant out 
of which the " Pierre de Soude*' is made in Alicante 
and formerly in Marseilles and many other parts of 
France. It is worth while for our Phylosophers to 
examine this subject for the Commodity is of great 
value. 

Thanks for the Pathetic Extract from your closing 
Lecture. It must have made a deep impression on 
the Minds of the young Gentlemen your Pupills and 
Hearers. 

I sincerely rejoice in the promotion of your Brother, 
whose Talents, Virtues and Experience, have well merited this distinction. But I cannot help laughing at 
McKean, entre nous, sub rosa, Tace. Taisez vous. I 
cannot convey the injunction in too many languages. I 
suppose McKean promoted Jacob because he is a 
Brother Monarchist. You and I remember the time 
when we heard your Brother say that in his opinion, 
** the Executive and Senate ought to be hereditary.*' 
You replied that you was ** of a different opinion." I 
have heard McKean say the same thing in the same 
words, and I know other substantial witnesses who can 
depose that he freely expressed this opinion in many 
Companies for several years. I never thought McKean 
or your Brother less friendly to our Constitution for 
these speculative opinions. I never in my Life went 
to such a length as this ; although wrap'd into future 
Times, when numbers, Wealth Luxury and Corruption 
shall have rendered this constitution insufficient to restrain the Passions of Men, I may have thought that the 
only way to preserve Liberty from an Emperor, would 
be to make the Executive and Senate more permanent 
than they are now. Mr. Madison, you say in one of 
your Letters, acquitted me of any intention to change 
the Constitution of the Union or the individual States, 
and I solemnly assure you, I never had a wish in my 
heart or a thought in my head of attempting any alteration in this respect. Now let me ask you, do you not 
think I have a right to boast of my Patience, Phylosophy 
and discretion in submitting to McKeans representations of me as a Monarchist, without retalliating upon 
him what I had heard him say and could prove he had 
said to many others. But McKean is not alone. Many 
others of the present ruling party are in the same predicament. One high in Power, office and confidence 
under the present administration, has said, not long 
before Mr. Jeffersons election that ** there ought to be a 
Monarchy in this Country, under one of the Princes of 
England, for our King/' This Idea was ever abhorrent 
to my inmost soul : yet I have never made a noise about 
it Others high in authority, Confidence and reputation 
with the present dominant sect, have often said that 
no Government was worth a Curse, but that of King, 
Lords and Commons. Yet I have never trumpetted these 
speeches. These last expressions are more susceptible 
of different interpretations. Some whom I have heard 
use them, did not I know mean the Tides of King, or 
Lords, nor the quality of hereditary Kings or Lords, 
they meant no more than that they wished the President, Senate and House of Representatives might be 
as independent branches of the Legislature as Kings 
Lords and Commons were in England, and as capable 
of ballancing each odier. This they might be under the 
present Constitution if the people would allow them to 
be so : and the People would not only allow it, but desire 
it, if they were not deceived by the Intrigues of Demagogues and the profligacy of foreign Renegado Printers. 
You ask me a Question of great Importance, far 
beyond my Capacity to answer. ** What is to be the 
Fate of Europe and of the Globe?" In Europe, according to present appearances " The Dyvels own Government" is to prevail till it changes all the Dynasties 
of Kings and Nobles and levels all Distinctions and 
Priviledges under Emperors and their Minions. Commerce, Manufactures and Science will languish under 
this gloomy Tyranny and Europe grow up into a forest 
inhabited only by Wild Beasts and a few Hunters who 
shall have fled into the wilderness from the Tyranny of 
Pen and Ink. You ask also what will be the Fate of 
our Country ? If the Phylosophers had not undermined 
the Christian religion, and the morals of the People, as 
much in America as they have in Europe, I should think 
Civilization would take its flight over the Adantic. But 
as it is, I see nothing but we must or rather that we 
shall follow the fate of Europe. Voltaire, Buffen, 
D'Alembert, Dideret, Raynal, Rousseau, Dr. Priesdy, 
Dr. Franklin, Mr. Helvetius and that miserable Dupe 
of his own vanity and their Intrigues, Frederick the 
great have made all Europe so discontented with themselves, their Government and Religion that, to abolish 
the Tide of King they are compelled to assume that of 
Emperor, and instead of the Whips of Monarchy, they 
are obliged to have recourse to the Scorpions of Despotism. 

Democracy is always so horribly bloody that it is always short lived and its atrocious cruelties, are never 
checked, but by extinguishing all popular elections to 
the great offices of State. I hope Americans will reflect upon these things before it is too late. But a War 
will bring them to a severe Tryal. To me, who must 
soon travel into another Country to return no more, 
these things are of little Consequence : yet I cannot 
throw off the habits of this world so entirely as to be 
indifferent to the future state of my Friends, Country 
and Species. I love them all and would cheerfully 
sacrifice myself to promote their happiness : but nothing 
I have done or can do, availeth any thing. I can do 
nothing more than pray for their prosperity, and weep 
over their follies and Misfortunes. I am not however 
very prodigal of my tears for I am determined to make 
the best of every thing as long as I can. 
You, my Friend I see are a greater proficient in this 

lylosophy than I am. You are grown as wise as a 

rpent and as harmless as a dove. I cannot force a 

&gt;rd of Politicks out of you ; for this discretion I blame 

u not Yet I will not adopt it yet Johnson said when 

: satt upon his Throne in a Tavern, there he dogma
ed and was contradicted, and in this he found delight 

y Throne is not in a Tavern but at my Fireside : there 

iogmatize, there I laugh and there the Newspapers 

metimes make me scold : and in dogmatizing, laughing 

d scolding I find delight, and why should not I enjoy 

since no one is the worse for it and I am the better.

Dear Sir, — Your Letter of the tenth, like all others 
jm your pen, notwithstanding all your apologies, was 
cordial to my spirits. 

I must confess to you that the Data, upon which we 
ason from the Prophecies concerning the future amelradon of the condition of Mankind, are too obscure 
id uncertain, to authorize us to build any systems 
K&gt;n them for the conduct of Nations. It is well to 
iderstand as much of them as we can : but the Rulers 
Men would presume too much, if they neglected 
istory. Experience and Philosophy and depended 
)on the Theological Interpretations of mysterious 
•edictions, which were not intended to be perfectly 
iderstood untill the time of their accomplishment 

Our Friend Priesdey believed, that France would establish a free Government because the King of France 
was the first of the ten Horns, which were to fall off. 
Whiston was disappointed, several times : and my friend 
Dr. West of New Bedford fully believed that Bonaparte 
had totally destroyed the Man of Sin, full seven years 
ago. 

I rather approve than censure your reserve upon 
political subjects. It would certainly have been better 
for me, and probably for the publick if I had been 
wise enough to have adopted some of it. 

I have read, the last Winter and Spring the debates 
in Congress with more regularity and attention than I 
ever did before, and have derived more information of 
the Motives, Principles, and designs of the present 
Majorities, than I could ever before penetrate. I must 
give to Mr. Mason, Mr. Early and many others the 
praise of system and consistency. Their fundamental 
Principle is, that the moment you raise a public force, 
you give up your Liberties ; and therefore there must 
be neither an army, Navy, Fortifications, a select Militia 
or even a revenue because if any of these exist, they 
must be entrusted to the Executive Authority, establish 
a system of Patronage, and overthrow the constitution. 
All this is very fine ! But it will fly like chaff before the 
Wind, as soon as any Nation by a series of Insults and 
depredations, shall excite a serious national resentment. 
Mr. Randolph is an unusual Phenomenon. I have read 
all his speeches. He has formed himself on the great 
Models of Wilkes, Junius, Cobbet, Tom Paine and 
Calender. 

He has introduced their modes into the Legislature, 
where I should have expected it would have produced from the Duelling Moralists and Christians, as many 
bullet holes through his body as there are cells in a 
honey comb. But I hope the gallant heroes of the 
southern and middle states are growing cooler and 
more rational. He has Wit, Fancy and memory in 
abundance. If his constitution endures till he has sown 
all his wild oats, and he begins to reason and exercise 
his Judgment, I am not without hopes he will come to 
something solid and usefuU. 

Taleyrands observation on the Character of Americans is somewhat enigmatical, or rather equivocal. If 
he meant that Americans are not attached to their 
Houses Lands and Memorials of their Ancestors like 
the European Nobility and Landholders in general, 
this is true and not very disgracefuU. But if he meant 
that Americans would universally sell their consciences 
and their honor, he lied. Although to my grief and 
indignation I believe he found some, whom he bought 
or hired and keeps still in his pay. That machivelian 
Jesuit, and Pharisee as well as the French in  General know us better than we know them. They are too 
well acquainted with our infirmities, follies and vices, 
for us to be upon equal terms with them, as long as 
we believe that the way to obtain justice of them is to 
humour them and give way to them. They will only 
do right when you withstand them to their faces when 
they are in the wrong. 

Your kind sympathy in my domestic afflictions affects 
me tenderly. <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> has been the Box of Pandora 
to me and my family. I see and feel and I hope think 
and reflect as I ought, but however pungent my grief or 
mortifying my disappointment, I do not complain. It is 
enough for me to suffer in my own Breast, and never torment others with endeavours to excite their compassion. I have no reason to hope that my name will 
contribute in the smallest degree to save the life of my 
Grandson. It is not possible for a Man to disapprove 
more decidedly than I have done the Conduct of Miranda 
and Col. Smith from the moment I heard of it, which 
was not till several weeks after the expedition had 
sailed. I impute no blame to Mr. Jefferson for dismissing Smith from his office. The absurdity of his 
conduct, throughout the whole Business cannot be too 
severly reprobated. I never saw Miranda. He came 
to London when I was there and was very intimate with 
Smith, but never visited me. I have ever disliked the 
Character of the Man, though I had always heard him 
spoken of in terms of admiration. 

If our Government knew or suspected the design I 
wonder she did not prevent it. Have they considered 
the Consequences to this Country, to France, Spain, 
Portugal or England of the Independence of South 
America. Is it an event to be desired by the U. S. ? 
I think not. It would increase and multiply the distractions of the World already too numerous. The Elements of Confusion are already too many to be soon 
exhausted. To augment them, with this additional 
source of them would be to make them interminable. 
If the headlong dashing fellow Miranda could take a 
Province, he could not hold it, without England, and 
England unless she is crazy will neither promote nor 
consent to the Independence of that country. It would 
be the means of their loosing their possessions in the 
West Indies and the East Indies too, and breaking up 
their Empire. The Consequences of our Independence 
have been so much more sudden, extensive and astonishing than we expected sanguine as we were, that I am 
by no means disposed to assist in hastening on events, 
which we know must come of themselves in the natural 
course of things. The Independence of South America 
must occasion convulsions and revulsions over the whole 
Globe, and ultimately pitt Europe against America. It 
is an abyss into which I dare not look. We stand well : 
let us stand still. 

Whatever Burr might say of Miranda, he is himself 
much such another. Bo.th qualified to flatter Col. Smith 
and lead him into scrapes. Both might be employed 
in subordinate stations but neither fit for the first responsible situations. 

From an expression in your Letter, it occurred to me 
that your son, my surgeon and Lieutenant might possibly be with my Grandson. I hope not. 

Permit me to present my congratulations on the 
Compliments you have received from Berlin. Your 
Countrymen will esteem it a great honor : for although 
they pretend to despize and hate Kings, yet they still 
gape at the honours they confer with as silly an admiration as Europeans do. 

Our Massachusetts resembles at present the Monster 
of Horace, a handsome human head, upon the Body of 
a Squallid Fish. Sic volo, sic jubeo, says the People ; 
Stet pro ratione voluntas. Absolute Power in a Majority, 
is as drunk as it is in one. 

Family Salutes Family, and blessings on it are 

supplicated by

Dear Sir, — I have two of your Letters to acknowledge at once. The Treatise on the spleen I have read, 
and been entertained by it, perhaps more than I should 
have been if I had been better acquainted with the 
sciences on which it depends. Your medical speculations are to me as entertaining as Romances of which I 
am a great lover; but they are as much in request 
among the learned of your Profession : so that I conclude they have more solid merit than I can pretend to 
be capable of estimating. One of my Family Physicians has had your medical works in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, ever since 
their arrival and I have not yet been able to get a sight 
of them. I have sent him this new work and I know 
not but you may be flattered or vexed with reviews of 
both. 

The appointment of my son to a professorship 
founded by one of his relations I hope will do no harm 
to the public, although I dread the consequences of it 
to his health. Aristotle, Dionissius, Hallicarnassensis, 
Longinus Quintilian, Demosthenes and Cicero, with 
twenty others are not easily read and studied by a Man 
of the World and a Senator of the United States. 
And after all cui bono ? Oratory in this age t Secrecy ! 
Cunning! Silence ! voila les grands sciences des temps 
moderns. Washington ! Franklin ! Jefferson ! Eternal 
Silence ! impenetrable Secrecy ! deep cunning ! these 
are the talents and virtues, which are tryumphant in 
these days. And in ancient days was it much otherwise ? Demosthenes and Cicero, the two consummate 
Masters died Martyrs to their excellence. When I 
group Washington with Franklin and Jefferson I mean 
only in the article of silence. He had integrity and 
public Virtue, as I seriously believe. Thus much for 
your Letter of the 26 of June, — that of the eleventh of 
July might be answered by a volume. 

Is there in the world at this day a Thuanus ? There 
may be, but I fear there is not. An historian who could 
look through Europe and America and detail the events 
and Characters of the World from 1760 to 1806, and 
then solemnly and truly say at the end of his work, 
"Pro Veritate Historiarum mearum, Deum ipsum 
obtestor," would, as slightly as you and I think of History in general, be a great blessing to Mankind. To 
such an Historian even the secret Memoirs of the Court 
of St. Cloud, and Cumberlands memoirs of his own 
Life might be of some use. I have the most curiosity 
to see the last. I was somewhat acquainted with Cumberland. He had a morbid Irritability in him, which 
rendered him disagreeable to the Men of Letters in 
general ; but his writings in Poetry are worthy of the 
study of Posterity and his prose style, is the most classical English of the last forty years. 

You are not the only one of my friends, who has 
very seriously urged me to write an History of my 
own times, or of my own Life. I have very serious Ideas 
of the Duties of an Historian. I think that no History 
should be written but under the oath of Thuanus. I 
know not whether his oath ought not to be extended 
farther and administered and taken in the words o\ tiie 
oath of a witness in our Courts of Justice to tell the 
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the Truth. 

Of all Men, who have acted a part in the great affairs 
of the World I am afraid I have been the most careless 
and negligent, in preserving Papers. I must write too many things from memor}% and oftentimes facts to 
which there is no other Witness left alive. The task, 
besides is so extensive, that I have not time left to execute it- To rummage Trunks, Letter books, bits of 
Journals and great heaps and bundles of old papers, is 
a dreadful bondage to old age, and an extinguisher of 
old eyes. The few letters of which I made Copies are 
preserved, but so many accidents happen to such things, 
that they may be lost : and indeed they were all written 
in so much haste, and so carelessly put upon paper that 
they are not fit for the public eye. What must I say of 
my own Vanit&gt;' and Levity ? Crimes I thank God I 
have none to record. Follies, indiscretions and trifles 
enough and too many. What of the Jealousy and 
En\y of those who have been my most intimate friends, 
Colleagues and Coadjutors ? What of the malice and 
vengeance of unprovoked enemies? It would be an 
easier emplo)Tnent to publish a Collection of my political works ; but I cannot afford to print them at my own 
expense and I dont believe a subscription could be obtained for the purpose, and no Bookseller would undertake it at his own expense and risque. These would be 
a tollerable account of my own life, and contain some 
materials for public Histor)'. 

Cobbet once said to Sam Malcolm, " There never was 
a greater difference bet\\'een two Men, than between 
Washington and Adams, in one point, the desire of 
fame. Washington had an enormous, an insatiable 
thirst for it ; but Adams was as excessively careless of 
it.'' He did not I presume intend it, and I certainly did 
not consider it, as a compliment. I am very sensible 
that I have been negligent of it, to a fault, and a very 
great fault too. There have been verj- many times in my life, when I h^Te reen so ^^Irared Ers r^y ow:: mind

Your reflections on human affairs, and particularly on 
the progress of the public opinion in the case of our 
Revolution, are as profound as they are just and true. 
I have sometimes thought that the public opinion is 
never right concerning present measures or future 
events. The secret of affairs is never known to the public, till after the event and often not then. Even in the 
freest and most popular government, events are preparing by causes that are at work in secret, known only 
to a very few, partially communicated in confidence to 
a few others, but never fully made known to the people 
till long after all is past. And very often the real 
springs, motives and causes remain secrets in the breasts 
of a few and perhaps of one, and perish with their 
keepers like the secret of Junius s Letters. Your 
Divine was more satirical than theological. God throws 
Empires and Kingdoms, as he does Rains, Plagues, 
Earthquakes, Storms, Sunshine, Good and Evil, in a 
manner that we cannot comprehend, and as far as we 
can see very often without that regard to Moralitj' 
which we think should govern the world. But although we see not as he sees, we have reasons enough 
to establish a rational belief, that all these things are 
disposed by unerring Wisdom, Justice and Benevolence. 
Nor do I see any reason to distinguish Emperors, Kings, 
Consuls or Presidents from the rest of Mankind. They 
are as good, in general, in proportion to their numbers 
as their subjects, and if worthless Men are sometimes 
at the head of affairs, it is, I believe because worthless 
Men are at the tail and in the middle. The most exalted Talents too are thrown upon the most worthless

determined and his vote is decided let Reason, Justice,

however ought not to be neglected in our seats of 
Education. Better times may arrive. My Son has 
delivered six lectures to his pupils besides his inaugural 
address, and I suppose he will deliver six or eight more, 
before he returns to Washington. At the expense of 
immense labour he has opened a field before the students and furnished the means of investigation, which 
will enable them to pursue the subject to any length 
they please and make themselves masters of all that is 
now to be known. He has and will lay open to them 
all the richest treasures of Greek and Roman, English 
and French Elegance, Sublimity and Pathos, and perhaps something from Italy and Germany. His Health 
I fear will sink under his efforts. 

Dr. Priesdeys Life I should be very glad to see, and 
hope that some of them will be sent to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> for sale. 
He was a man of very extraordinarj' Talents and incredible application. If he had written but a tenth 
part of his works he would have left a ten times greater 
reputation. If he had written nothing but his Chemistry he would have been thought a prodigy. 

Suppose a grave controversy should arise among the 
friends of Dr. Rush, Dr. Franklin and Dr. Rittenhouse, 
which of the three had the best pretensions to the honour of the discover)' of the demonstration that the 3 
angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles! 
You will say this would be ridiculous, for the discovery was made some thousands of years before either of 
those Philosophers was born. Very true, and equally 
absurd is the dispute, whether the original Idea of the 
perfectibility of Man, is to be ascribed to Dr. Price, Dr. 
Priestley or Mr. Condorcet. It is more ancient than 
either by thousands of years. Plato had it when he 
talked of imitating God. The Stoicks had it when they 
described their wise Man. Epicurus had it when he 
described his man of pleasure. The human mind is 
made capable of conceiving something more perfect 
than any created being that exists. Artists, Painters, 
Poets, Statuaries, Musicians, are all capable of conceiving and imagining something in their Arts, superiour to any thing they have done, or has been done by 
others. . It is a precept in all these arts as well as in 
Ethicks to aim at greater perfection than has ever been 
attained and perhaps than ever can be attained. The 
Christian Religion has adopted and sanctioned this 
Theory in stronger terms than any modern Philosophers have employed. Be ye perfect, even as your 
Father in Heaven is perfect. The eternal, omniscient, 
omnipotent, and all benevolent Model of perfection is 
placed before Men, for their perpetual Meditation and 
imitation. By this however it is not intended, that 
every Man can ever become eternal, almighty and 
allwise. It is an Idea of the Christian religion, and ever 
has been of all Believers in the immortality of the soul 
that the intellectual part of Man is capable of progressive improvement for ever. Where then is the 
sense of calling the perfectibility of Man an original 
Idea or a modern discovery. What is their meaning 
under these words, perfectibility of Man ? Do they 
mean that the human Body can be made immortal on Earth and incx&gt;miptible, free from Pains and diseases, 
by human reason ? Do they mean that the strength 
of the human body can be increased so as to remove 
mountains, to shake the earth and stop the planets? 
If they mean any such things as these, the discover}has not yet been made and never will be. Do they 
mean that the human Intellect can be enlarged here in 
the Body to comprehend the whole Constitution and 
course of Nature? This is not less incredible, and 
extravagant than the rest In short I consider, the 
Perfectibilit)' of Man as used by modem Philosophers, 
to be mere words without a meaning, that is mere 
nonsense. 

The continual amelioration of the condition of Man 
in this World, moral. Physical, political, civil and QEconomical, is a very intelligible Idea and no doubt is to 
be desired, meditated, laboured, and promoted by all 
Men, and those who do most for it ought to be most 
esteemed. But in this there is nothing but Simplicity 
and common sense. Nothing to excite the gaping 
wonder of a vicious mob, nor the ignorant admiration 
of superficial Philosophers. As a friend to Dr. Price 
and Dr. Priestley I will never require this honour for 
them, from any body. Condorcet is wellcome to as 
much of this honour as he pleases, and to all the 
mischievous nonsense, impudence and Cruelty that 
he instigated and promoted. Poor Price was once 
left gravely to publish in print that the progress of 
Knowledge might discover a Method of rendering Men 
immortal on Earth. 

Kant, the German Philosopher, has advanced, as I 
understand, though I never could find any intelligible 
account of his reveries, something like this notion of Derfectibility, and I believe before Priestley, Price or 
^ondorcet His System is Antagonism. And what is 
\ntagonism ? Why, all Government is to be abolished, 
is well as all Religion, and Men are to be left to their 
latural Jealousies and Competitions, till they beat and 
3ruise and murder one another, sufficiently to convince 
ind compell each other to practice perfect Justice, Hunanity and Benevolence. Are such Dreams, Visions 
md ravings any honor, to any body ? Call them 
Philosophy if you will but they are bedlamism. 

We in this commonwealth, are making great ad•rances, if not in the Perfectibility of human nature, yet 
n the great Arts of lying and libelling and the other 
\rts which grow out of them, such as wielding the Cudgel and the Pistol. When Democratical Govcrnnutntii 
^egin to produce such fruits as these in such great 
ibundance what are we to expect? A conviction in 
avour of mixed Governments ? or a Ca:sar, or HonaDarte ? To be sure it is safest in such cases to \hi on 
:he side of the Populace, because Men are safi:r from

time of the Revolution, in moments of critical distress, 
with too much levity I fear, and too little serious consideration, "Stand still and see the salvation of the 
Lord.'' I really believe I now say it with more serious 
impressions. 

If Mr. Jefferson was a Warriour, I should suspect 
that his administration was contrived to give employment to the People and turn their minds from faction 
and Politicks by involving himself and them in a War, 
with Spain, France or England or with all three. The 
Romans were obliged to practice this policy for seven 
hundred years. But Jefferson is not a Roman. If 
Peace should be concluded between France and England, we shall be in a perilous situation. I sometimes 
think that Bonaparte is making Peace with Mr. Fox, 
for the sake of Chastizing Jefferson and his Coadjutors, 
whom by this time he must despize and hate. I am as 

usual, your 

obliged friend

Dear Sir, — When I reed, your favour of the 24 Oct 
I soberly expected a grave dissertation on the Perfectibility of Man. Although I thank you for the political 
information you give me, which is amusing, and although I doubt not your Physiological researches will 
result in something usefuU to die publick, yet, as I have 
ever considered all Arts, Sciences and Litterature as of 
small importance in comparison of Morals, I was disappointed in finding nothing upon the great subject of 
the Perfectibility of human Nature, which I suppose is 
to be ranged under the head of Ethicks. I really wish 
you would tell me what you understand by this mighty 
discovery of Price, Priestley or Condorcet. Perfectibility, I should suppose to mean, capabilitj' of Perfection ; 
or susceptibility of perfection. But what is Perfection ? 
It is self evident, there cannot be more than one perfect Being in the Universe. If this Truth is not perceived by one act of intuition, the progress of reason 
is so obvious and so decisive, in the demonstration 
of it, that it may well pass for self evident. Divine 
Power is no doubt essential to Perfection. There can 
be but one being in the Universe possessed of almighty Power ; because if there were two, each would 
be able to controul the other, and indeed to annihilate 
him : and this Hypothesis would be equivalent to asserting that there was no Power at all in the Universe. 
The Absurdit)' is niultiplied in proportion as you suppose more than two almight)' Beings. These great 
Phylosophers then cannot be supposed to mean that 
every Man, Woman and Child is capable of becoming 
a Supream and all perfect Being. What then do they 
mean ? Do they mean perfection in this world or in 
a future state? Do they mean perfection of Mind or 
Body or both? Condorcet and Priestley believed in 
no soul, spirit or Mind distinct from the Body : they 
must therefore have meant that the Perfectibilitv resided in the Body or matter. Do they mean that in a 
future state, the Body may be purified from all causes 
of disease and deadi, liberated froni all Pain, Grief, 
Sorrow and Uneasiness and that forever. If this is 
all their meaning, it is- no more than the Christian 
Doctrine, and therefore certainly no discover)' of Price, 
Priestley or Condorcet. The greatest part however of 
the modern Philosophers, who have written and discoursed upon this Mysterious doctrine, have confined 
their Ideas to this terrestrial existence and have believed in no other. If they mean that Man is capable, 
by abstract meditation, and habitual practice of acquiring that self possession and command which can bear 
pain and think it no more intollerable than Pleasure, 
the Felicis Animi immota tranquilitis, this is no more 
than the Perfectibility of the Stoick Philosophy. If 
they mean that by banishing all Ideas of God or Gods, 
of future Rewards and Punishments and of moral 
Government or <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> in the Universe, every 
Man may get into an habit of taking pleasure in every 
Thing, this is no more than the Perfectibility of Epicurus or Lucretius, and certainly no discovery of Price, 
Priestley or Condorcet What then do they mean? 
Do they mean that chemical Processes may be invented 
by which the human Body may be rendered immortal 
and incapable of Disease upon Earth. This, in a fit 
of enthusiasm, resembling Instances which I shall enumerate before I finish this Letter, Dr. Price advanced 
in a printed note to one of his publications. Surely the 
good Doctor had forgot his Bible which pronounces an 
irrevocable Decree of Death on every human Being, 
allmost in every page of it. Price and Priestley were 
honest enthusiasts carried away by the popular contagion of the times, for these moral and political Histericks are at least as infectious as the small Pox or 
yellow fever; but the greater part of Politicians and 
Phylosophers who prated about the Perfectibility of 
Man, mean nothing but to seize, occupy and confound 
the attention of the Public, while they were amusing and 
of z^nssm jiiiTTiy*^. i s real*} hinniiiarin^ xr ihf nria?

them all to bart beer persons vb:tse Brains hii b«*n 
shaken out of tbefr sar::ral r»:»shicrL For the ur»rv?r region of Man is fzzrnisbed lie the rriiije repon of the 
air. Mists arise irozn the earth, steams fron: cunchiUs. 
exhalations from the sea ani smoke from nre ; Nxn all 
Qouds are the same in oc'mposition as wel: as cv^nscquences ; and fumes issuing from a lakes t^HII furnish 
as comeiv and useful! a vapour as incense from an altan 
As the iace of nature never oroduces rain, but when it is overcast and disturbed : so human understandin^j 
seated in the brain, must be troubled and overspread 
by vapours, ascending from the lower faculties to water 
the invention and render it fruitful. Two instances 
may be produced to prove and explain this Thcor\\ 
The first is that of Henr&gt;" the fourth of France, whose 
whole project of universal empire, as well as that ol 
subduing the Turk and recovering Palestine* arose from an absent female, whose eves had raised a protuberancv', and before emission she was sent into an 
ennemy's countr\\ The collected part of the semen, 
raised and inflamed became a Lust converted to choler 
turned head upon the spinal duct, and ascended to the 
brain. The \tr§ same principle that influences a bully 
to break the windows of a whore that has jilted him. 
naturaDv stirrs up a great Prince to raise might)- armies, 
and dream of nothing but sieges, batdes and \-ictories. 
In this place I cannot avoid introducing a reflection by 
way of digression. What a piry it is that our Congress 
had not known this disco ver\-. and that Alexander 
Hamiltons projects of raising an army of idx\ thousand Men, ten thousand of them to be CaA^alrx- and his 
projects of sedition Laws and Alien Laws and of new 
taxes to support his army, all arose from a superabundance of secretions which he could not nnd whores 
enough to draw off I and that the same ^-apours produced his Lyes and Slanders by which he totally destroyed his part)- forever and finally lost his Life in the 
field of Honor. But to return from this diTression. 

The second instance is that of Louis 14th. who for 
the space of above thirt\- years amused himself to take 
and lose Towns : beat armies and be beaten : drive 
Princes out of their cominions : friirht children firom 
their bread and butter : bum. lay ii-aste, plunder, dragoon, massacre subject and stranger, friend and foe, 
male and female : it is recorded that the Phyiosophers 
of each Countrj. were in grave dispute upon causes 
nauiraL moral and politfcaL to find our where they 
should assign an original solution of this Phenomenon. 
At last the \^pour or spirit, which animated the Hero's 
brain being in perperjal circuladon. seized upon that region of the human Body so reno\^Tied for furnishing 
the Zibeta occidentalis. and gathering there into a 
tumour, left the rest of the worid for that time in 
Peace. Of such mighty* consequences it is, where 
these exhalations fix ; and of so little whence thev 
proceed. The same spirits which in their superiour 
progress, would conquer a Kingdom, descending upon 
the Anus conclude in a fistula. 

And here again I feel an irresistable inclination, to 
introduce a Reflection by way of digression. How 
ver&gt;^ desirable it is that all the vapours in the heads 
of our modem Philosophers, should take a turn downwards, and relieve the world from their sillv and mischievous speculations. And above all how devoutly it 
is to be wished that Xapoleon may have a Fistula large 
enough to carr)' off all his vapours and set the world 
at peace. 

The Phylosopher from whom I have borrowed this 
ingenious Theor&gt;' is Dr. Swift, who in that great Phylosophical effort the Tale of a Tub, has in the ninth 
section given the world a profound discourse on the 
original use and improvement of madness in a Commonwealth, which whole section I earnestly recommend 
to your serious meditation, as one of the profoundest 
and most important systems of Phylosophy which the 
last Century produced, and by which I have been convinced that all modem Ideas of the Perfectibility' of 
Man will be drawn from the Brains of ever&gt;' Philosopher upon earth, as soon as a fistula shall be formed in 
its proper place, and either break or be skillfully cutt, 
so as to occasion a plentiful discharge. So no more at 
present from your loving friend 

<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">J. Adams</a>.

P.S. — What are your reflections on the Conquest of 
Buenos Aires? Is it not a great event? Will the 
English stop short of Chili and Peru? What effect 
will it have on France and Spain ? What effects from 
it have we reason to apprehend ? Will it not protect 
Portugal from France and Spain ; because the Brasils 
will certainly be in the Power of the English as soon 
as Portugal sha:ll become their Ennemy ?

Dear Sir, — I thank you for yours of the twenty fifth 
of November. I was in hopes you would have explained to me the system of human Perfectibility which 
is claimed as the Invention of Dr. Priesdey. The system 
of the French CEconomists I took some pains, more 
than five and twenty years ago, to understand ; but 
could not find one Gentleman among the Statesmen, 
Phylosophers and Men of Letters, who pretended to 
understand it. I procured the Books of Dr. Quanay 
and I could not understand much of them, and much of 
what I did understand I did not believe. He was a 
sort of Jacob Behmen, a Count Zinzendorf or German 
Kant, a Swiedenburgh or George Whitfield. He had 
a practice of Knighting his Disciples. And Dr. Franklin professing to be one of his Disciples, procured an 
introduction to him and condescended to receive this 
honor from his hands. The hand of this Man laid 
upon the head of one of his Disciples, conferred a Mark 
of distinction, a priviledged order, which for what I 
know was respected by at least as many People among 
the Philosophers as the Cross of Saint Louis, or the Ribbon of the Holy Ghost. The Perfectibility of Man 
was as I think one of the Dogmas of this sect. And 
one great Branch of this Perfectibility was a universal 
and perpetual Peace among all Nations and all Men. 
This Idea was not invented by Dr. Priestley, for the 
Abby de Saint Pierre had written two volumes upon universal and perpetual Peace an hundred years before him. 

Some who pretend to believe in these pacific systems, 
advance that it is only necessary to convince all Nations 
and Peoples and Individuals, that war is never in any 
case advantageous to them. This to be sure does not 
at first blush appear to be very easily done. But let 
us never cease to din in the ears of the people this 
great Truth and others connected with it. Let us fatigue 
them with perpetual exclamations on the enormous increase of Taxes, Imposts, Excises and duties, for the 
maintenance of Armies and Navies always on foot ; on 
the draughts from Agriculture and Industry of an immense number of hands, whose utility belongs not only 
to the Nation that produced them, but to all other 
nations who might enjoy the fruit of their Labour by 
Commerce. 

On the impossibility of preserving internal Liberty 
with the system of permanent Troops or standing 
Armies and our American Knights of Quanay would 
add Navies or any thing more powerful at sea than Gun 
Boats. 

On the immense destruction of Lives, for a dead 
Man is good for nothing, but a living Man as long as 
he can work and consume the fruits of the earth or the 
Manufactures of Industry, is useful to the whole society 
of the human Race. 

On the inconceivable Barbarity of cutting one 
anothers throats. Our Philosophers add that no other 
Being but Man is Guilty of this Crime, although he is 
the only one whose interest is connected with the Life 
of his fellow. But in this they assert facts diametrically contrary to the Truth : for the whole animal 
Creation as far as we are acquainted with it are daily 
destroying and feeding on their fellow Creatures. And 
those of the same species fight and kill, as often as 
Men. And some of them not unfrequently eat one 
another. The animals too are interested in one anothers Lives, in a very great degree if not so much as 
Men. In Sum, on the evils, absurdities, Inconsistencies 
and horrors of War. 

On the other hand we must challenge all Mankind, 
to produce one single advantage which results from 
War. 

Anciently the People sometimes appeared to derive 
some advantage by the spoils which were placed in the 
public Treasuries, to defray the expenses and exempt 
them from Taxes. This benefit however was only in 
appearance. But now the fruits of victory are so far 
from compensating the expenses of it, that we must 
support our Taxes even in time of Peace. 

Now the People arm themselves against each other, 
only to support the mad pretensions and to cherish the 
stupid Pride of an handful of Despotts, Nobles and 
Priests. Now, Commerce, the instrument of an universal alliance, establishing a Channel of communication between Man and Man, from the North Pole to 
the South renders it visible to the grossest eyesight, 
that we are made for one another, that our destination 
is to be useful reciprocally, that we are members of the 
same body and children of the same family. 

Now the Art of Printing, that Gift of Heaven, applying the reason of the present and all past Generations, 
to the benefit of all Nations, carries with the rapidity 
of Lightening these benevolent, salutary and beneficent 
sentiments, over all parts of the Globe. 

These are the arms with which we are to excite the 
holy insurrection of Nature against the Despots, who 
would stifle her voice. 

Barbarians as they are ! They have only to will and 
to write, and the accents of Equality and Fraternity 
would resound in every heart! Not one of them ever 
conceived the sublime Idea ! They collect Men together, 
only to make them fall under each others blows, like 
those who for a vile profit, exhibit spectacles of animals, 
whom they excite to lacerate one another. 

Differences may arise between nations as well as individuals, but as the latter discuss their rights before 
Trybunals, there is no difficulty moral or phisical, to 
prevent the former from following a similar procedure. 

The time will come when the whole world will cover 
with Benedictions the generous nation, which by being 
the first to pronounce that she renounced the right 
of Conquest, has displayed the standard of universal 
peace. 

I shall not essay an examination of this Revery of a 
Perfectionist. 

Of all the Patriot things that Pultney writ, 
The Earl of Bath confutes it every Bit. 

Bonaparte at the head of this generous Nation, has 
taught the world some different Lessons. 

Quanay taught before Priestley. So did the Quakers. 

Your honest Neighbours of this denomination can harrangue as eloquently on this subject as the French 
Philosophers: so could their predecessors before 
Priestley was born. 

Give me leave now to turn your attention to a set of 
Philosophers much more ancient than these. I shall 
confine myself to one of them at present, and to save 
you the trouble of consulting Concordances will quote 
Chapter and Verse. Turn then if you please to the 
eleventh chapter of Isaiah and the sixth verse ** The wolf 
shall dwell with the lamb, and the Leopard shall lie 
down with the kid, and the Calf and the young Lion 
and the fading together ; and a little Child shall lead 
them. And the Cow and the Bear shall feed; their 
young ones shall lie down together ; and the Lion shall 
eat straw like the ox. And the sucking Child shall play 
on the hole of the Asp, and the weaned Child shall put 
his hand on the Cockatrice den. They shall not hurt 
nor destroy in all my holy Mountain for the Earth shall 
be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters 
cover the sea." 

And again in Chapter sixty fifth verse 25. "The 
Wolf and the Lamb shall feed together and the Lion 
shall eat straw like the Bullock, and dust shall be the 
serpents meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all 
my holy Mountain." I am not about to write a Book 
upon the Prophecies and therefore will not be more 
particular. But there are other Prophecies which speak 
of a time to coipe when Men shall beat their Swords 
into Ploughshares and their spears into pruning Hooks 
and learn War no more. What may be the meaning 
of these highly figurative expressions. I shall not at 
present enquire. But they seem to intimate an happier and more pacific state of human Life than Reason 
or Experience would justify us in expecting. Condorcet however would pronounce them at once " Visions 
Judaiques" and pay no more regard to them than to 
the Prophecies of the Sybills. They are however as 
distinct and rational intimations of the perfectibility of 
Man abstracted from all divine authority, as any french 
Phylosopher has ever foretold. How then can Condorcet pretend to have first started the Idea. 

Price and Priestley believed these Prophecies to be 
inspired. How then can they pretend to have invented the same thing. I say Priestley believed these 
Prophecies for they seemed to be the only parts of the 
Bible that he thought inspired. 

45 years ago when I wore my Barrister Gown band 
and Tye wig a French Barber in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> was in the 
habit of shaving and dressing me. His Name I think 
was Dehon. One morning he told me he had lived 
some years in London and dressed several of the Nobility, of one of whom he related a long story of some 
very extravagant conduct, which I have forgot. Dehon 
concluded his story by observing that his Lordship was 
a little '* crack." All the Nobility in England, Mr. Adams added Dehon, are crack. He meant cracked. 
I have long thought the Philosophers of the eighteenth 
Century and almost all the Men of Science and Letters, 
crack. In my youth I was much amused with the Idea 
that this Globe of Earth was the Bedlam of the Universe. If I were now to judge of it by the Conduct 
and Writings of the Men of Science, I should be more 
disposed than ever to believe that the Sun, Moon and 
Stars send all their Lunaticks here for confinement, as 
they used to send them from Paris to Brietre. I must 
tell you that my wife, who took a fancy to read this 
letter as it lay upon my table, bids me tell you that she 
thinks my head too, a little crack, and I am half of that 
mind myself. 

Although McKean has been somewhat of a Whiffler 
and a Shuffler, I should be sorry to hear that he was 
subjected to an impeachment, of which you seem to 
think him in danger. I think him an honest Man in 
the main, though sometimes misled by his vanity and 
Ambition as so many others of our revolutionary 
Patriots have been and are. The facility and frequency of Impeachments in this Country forebode 
much evil. They are very dangerous remedies and 
should never be employed but in desperate Cases. My 
Paper allows me room to subscribe myself your affectionate Friend

My dear Doctor, — You make me very happy when 
you say that you agree with me upon the subject of 
the Perfectibility of Man. Let every Man endeavor to 
amend and improve one and we shall find ourselves in 
the right Road to all the Perfection we are capable of: 
but this rule should by no means exclude our utmost 
exertions to amend and improve others, and in every 
way and by all means in our Power to ameliorate the 
Lot of Humanity, Invent new Medicines, construct new 
Machines write new Books, build better Houses, and 
Ships, institute better Governments, discountenance 
false Religions, propagate the only true one, diminish 
the vices and increase the Virtues of all Men and 
Women whenever we can. You have done a great 
deal, and I very litde in this way. I sometimes wish 
that I had never been concerned in any public Business. 
I might then have been sure that I had done no harm. 
One of the Popes ordered an inscription upon his 
Monument, which would suit me very well. Hie situs 
est Adrian, qui nihil sibi in vita infelicius duxit, quam 
quod imperavit 

I beg that you would not spare a moment of your 
time, or one of your thoughts from your business on 
account of my Letters. If I had any useful employment I should not write them. But as Voltaire says 
"II est plus difficile de s'amuser, que de s'enricher." 
You can grow rich and do good easier than I can avoid 
ennui. 

I dont know but what I shall take your advice 
and write my own worthless Life, merely to keep myself out of Idleness. If my generous fellow Citizens, 
the wisest and best People under heaven you know, 
had discarded me from all public employment, while I 
could have spoken so as to be understood at the Bar, 
by the Court and Jury I would have thanked them. 
But they wore me out with hard service and then 
turned me adrift like an old Dray Horse. But I have 
read Dr. Isaac Barrow upon Contentment and Patience, 
and have learned of him to despize my Despizers. 
Stop ! Is there not too much pride in this last sentiment 'i I know not but I believe Dr. Barrow will bear 
me out in it. 

The Bible contains the most profound Philosophy, 
the most perfect Morality, and the most refined Policy 
that ever was conceived upon earth. It is the most Republican Book in the World, and therefore I will still 
revere it. The Curses against Fornication and Adultery, and the prohibition of every wanton glance or 
libinous ogle at a woman, I believe to be the only system that ever did or ever will preserve a Republick in 
the World. There is a Paradox for you. But if I dent 
make it out you may say if you please that I am an 
enthusiast. I say then that national Morality never was 
and never can be preserved, without the utmost purity 
and chastity in women : and without national Morality 
a Republican Government cannot be maintained. Therefore my dear Fellow Citizens of America, you must ask 
leave of your wives and daughters to preserve your 
Republick. I believe I shall write a Book upon this 
Topick before I die and if I could articulate a word I 
dont know but I would go into the Pulpit and preach 
upon it. I should be very learned : ransack Greece, 
and Rome and Judea and France and England and 
Holland &amp;c. 

What shall I say of the Democratical Vice President 
and the Federal would be President Burr. Although 
I never thought so highly of his natural Talents or his 
acquired attainments, as many of both parties have 
represented them, I never believed him to be a Fool. 
But he must be an Idiot or a Lunatick if he has really 
planned and attempted to execute such a Project as is 
imputed to him. It is even more senseless and extravagant than Mirandas. It is utterly incredible that any 
foreign Power, should have instigated him. It is utterly 
incredible that without foreign aid he should have 
thought that die transalleganian People would revolt 
with him ; or even if they should revolt, that he and they 
could maintain themselves against the United States, 
who could so easfly Uock up the Mississippi Any Man 
who has read the circular Letters to their Constituents 
fix)m Members of the House of Representatives in 
Congress from some of the Southern States, while I 
vas President, must be con\nnced that there were ver\' 
nany among them who had no more r^ard to Truth 
han the De\TL At present I suspect that this L\ing 
&gt;pirit has been at Work concerning Burr and that Mr. efferson has been too hast)' in his Message in which he 
las denounced him by name and pronounced him guilt)*. 
Jut if his guilt is as clear as the Noon day Sun, the 
irst Magistrate ought not to have pronounced it so 
)efore a Jur)' had tr)'ed him. 

Wilkinsons Conduct, as it is represented is equally 
mjustifiable. But we shall hear more about it. The 
Hrhole Thing is a kind of Waterspout a terrible WhirlX)ol, threatening to ingulph ever)* Thing. But it may 
)e as the Fable says that single Bullet shot through it, 
vill quell it all at once to the level of the sea. 

Batons relation is very strange. The President 
akes no Notice of it. Is Burr so shallow as soberly 
:o confide such a secret to him ? But why is he called 
general Eaton ? Our Laws forbid any Commission to 
3e taken under a foreign Power. He had no Commission from the President. He was only appointed by 
:he Ex Bashaw. He had no more authority than Mr. Deane had when he entered into a Contract with Du 
Coudray and his hundred officers, and assumed the 
Powers of a Plenipotentiary. You and I have seen 
enough of adventurers to be put upon our guard. I of 
ill Men in the world would be the farthest from injuring 
Eaton. I have every motive in the world to wish that 
bis reward may be equal to his merit, but reports are 
current, which suggest to me the propriety of suspending Judgment. 

I mention this to you in perfect Confidence, but with 
great reluctance. I hope all will turn out better than 
my fears. The hint may be of use to you. It cannot 
now be long before an Ecclairiessement must take place 
and we shall know better what to think of Burr and his 
designs. 

I am dear Sir with usual Compliments yours

Dear Sir, — Your favour of the third is received. I 
am willing to allow you Philosophers your opinion of 
the universal Gravitation of Matter, if you will allow 
mine that there is in some souls a principle of absolute 
Levity that buoys them irresistably into the Clouds. 
Whether you call it etherial spirit or inflammable air it 
has an uncontroulable Tendency to ascend, and has no 
capacity to ascertain the height at which it aims or the 
means by which it is to rise. This I take to be precisely 
the Genius of Burr, Miranda and Hamilton, among a 
thousand others of less or more Note. These Creatures have no prudence. If a Man is once so disarranged in his Intellect as to deliberate upon a Project 
of ascending to the seven Starrs, it is natural enough 
that he should first attempt to seize the two Horns of 
the New Moon and make her his first stage. 

Burrs project of making himself V. P. of U. S. to a 
reasonable Man would have appeared an high degree 
of extravagance, for there were ten thousand Men in 
the United States, who were as well qualified for it and 
had merited it by much greater ser\'ices, sufferings and 
sacrifices. Yet in this he succeeded. Buoyed up by 
the flattery of the Presbjterians in Connecticutt, New 
York, New Jersey, Pensilvania and all the Southern 
States, from the Veneration in which they held his 
Father and Grandfather, the Factions of Clintons and 
Livingstons alternately employed him as their Instrument, till the Virginians conceived the Project of engaging him to corrupt the State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> from the 
Federal Interest In this They and he succeeded : but 
all the rest of his Projects have been chimerical and 
without success. What could have inspired Burr with 
hopes of being an Ambassador, a Chief Justice of Pensilvania or a Governor of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, or Vice P. of U. S. 

Omnia Numina absunt, si absit Prudentia. Prudence 
is the first of Virtues and the root of all others. Witiiout Prudence there may be abstinence but not Temperance ; there may be rashness but not Fortitude ; there 
may be insensibility or obstinacy but not Patience. 

Without Prudence, to weigh and deliberate on the 
Nature and consequences of an enterprise, and to consider his means and his end, a Man who engages in it, 
commits himself to Chance, and not seldom when a 
thousand Chances are against him to one in his favour. 

I pity my old Friend McKean. Like many others of 
our Antidiluvian Patriarchs he was carried away into 
error by the French Revolution and delivered himself 
into the hands of a party with whom he never could 
cordially co-operate. 

In the Time of Robespierre and his bloodyest Cruelties I dined once in Company with McKean, Gallatin 
and Burr and they were all very loud in praise of Robespierre. " He was honest, and the Saviour of France." 
Some of the Company presumed to censure their Patriot 
and Hero, and all three of those Gendemen cried out 
" Robespierres Crime is his Honesty." How many 
Instances do we see every day which prove that Honesty 
is not the best Policy. They have all of them tried a 
different Policy, but I believe they will all come to a bad 
end and find at last that Honesty would have been a 
better Policy. 

I now come to a Mystery in your Letter. I have but 
four Grandsons : two of them are boys under seven 
years of age and have been at my House and in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> 
all Winter. They are the Children of my son John ; 
the two others are sons of my Daughter Smith, the 
youngest of whom whose name is John is now with me, 
and has not been in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> since last May ; the 
oldest is William now to my great Grief in Trinidad. 
No Letter therefore can have been left at your House 
from any Grandson of mine. I cannot unriddle this 
Mystery but by supposing that some adventurer has 
forged a Letter : but for what end I know not I thank 
you with all my heart for your kind Intentions towards 
my supposed Grandson. They are as authentic proofs 
of your Friendship, as if it had been my real Grandson. 

Pennsylvania can fall down on one broadside and 
then roll over to the other broadside, and then turn 
keel upwards and then right herself up again. She is 
a ship however so violently addicted to pitching and 
rolling that I should not wonder if she dismasted herself. 

To quit the figure and speak plain English I have 
long thought that the first serious civil war in America 
will commence in Pensilvania. The two Nations of 
Irish and Germans who compose the principal part of 
the People, are so entirely governed by their Passions, 
have so litde reason and less knowledge that it will be 
impossible to keep them steady in any just system of 
Policy. They will one day repent in Saccloth the ascendency they have given to the Transaleganian and 
Southern Atlantic States and so will <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. But 
so contagious is Folly that we in the Mass. are running 
the same course. I do not believe however that Sullivan if he should be chosen, will harmonize long with 
his Party. Not half so long as McKean has. He is in 
heart and in head no more of a Democrat than McKean. 
I have known him not much less than forty years. He 
has never been a steady nor a Man. But he is 

not malevolent enough for his Party, nor ignorant 
His general aim has been to be of the strongest side, 
and consequently he has often offended all Parties at 
times. 

I should be glad to receive your explication of the 
strange Story of my Grandson. You do not say that 
the Letter was from Col. Smith. What can the secret be ? 

My Family reciprocate the friendly sentiments of 

yours and none more heartily than

I thank you, my dear sir for the promptitude of your 
answer to my last Letter, and for inclosing the misterious one to you, which however has every appearance 
of honesty about it. My Daughter started the Idea that it might be our Friend Wm. Smith of Charlestown 
who married Miss lzz2ird : but the date of the Letter 
is <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. My Daughter, upon my receipt of 
your Letter wrote to her Husband on the subject. If 
I can persuade her to give me an extract of his answer 
I will inclose it. 

If Credit is to be given to Judge Innis's Deposition, 
and Sebastians Conviction it is certain that Spain has 
tampered in the U. S. and if she tampered once before 
with others she might a second time, with Burr. If I 
were convinced of his Guilt of treason or treasonable 
Intentions I should infer that he was employed by 
Spain. 

You ask me if I do not sometimes imprecate evils 
on the day, on which I became a Politician. I have endeavoured to recollect that day. It is a remote one. 
A mighty impression was made upon my little head at 
the Time of the Expedition against Cape Breton, 
under General Pepperel, in 1 745 and on the approach 
of the Duke D'Anvilles Armament against <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. 
But I have only my memory to testify so early. An 
odd accident has within a month brought to light the 
enclosed Letter, which has lain fifty one years and an 
half in darkness and silence, in dust and Oblivion. 
Pray tell me your Reflections on the Sight of this droll 
Phenomenon. I fancy they will be 

I. What would our Tories and Quakers and 
Proprietors have said if this Letter had been published in 1774, 5 or 6? But I will not guess at any 
more of your Observations. You shall make them 
yourself and relate them to me. But I will make my 
own Remarks first and submit them to you. 

I. Pain in common sense, says that no body in 
America, ever thought, till he revealed to them the 
mighty Truth that America would ever be independent 
I remember not the Words, but this is the sense as I 
remember it. This I have always, at all times and in 
all places contradicted and have affirmed that the Idea 
of American Independeace, sooner or later, and of, 
the Necessity of it, sometime or other was always 
familiar to Gendemen of reflection in all Parts of 
America and I spoke of my own knowledge in this 
Province. 

2. I very distincdy remember that in the War of 
1755, a Union of the Colonies to defend themselves 
against the encroachments of the French was the 
general wish of the Gendemen with whom I conversed : 
and it was the opinion of some that we could defend 
ourselves and even conquer Canada, better without 
England than with her, if she would but allow us to 
unite and exert our Strength, Courage and Skill, diffident as we were of the last. 

3. It was the fear of this Union of the Colonies 
which was indeed commenced in a Congress at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, 
which induced the English to take the war into their 
own hands. 

4. The War was so ill conducted by Shirley, Lord 
Loudun, Braddock and all other British Commanders 
till Wolf and Amherst came forward, that the utmost 
Anxiety prevailed and a thousand Panicks were 
spread lest the French should overrun us all. At 
this time I was not silone in wishing, that we were 
unshackled by Britain and left to defend ourselves. 

5. The Treatment of the Provincial officers and 
soldiers by the British officers during that War, made 
my blood boil in my Veins. 

6. Notwithstanding all this, I had no desire of 
Independence, as long as Britain would do us Justice. 
I knew it must be an obstinate struggle, and saw no 
advantage in it, as long as Britain should leave our 
Liberties inviolate. 

7. Jefferson has acquired such QAory by his declaration of Independence in 1776 that I think I may modestly enough boast of my Declaration of Independence 
in 1755, twenty one years older than his. 

8. Our Governor elect, in his Biographical Sketch of 
Samuel Adams ascribes to him the honour of the first 
Idea and Project of Independence. In 1755 when my 
Letter to Doctor Nathan Webb was written I had never 
seen the Face of Samuel Adams. 

9. The English, the Scotch, the Tories and Hyperfederalists will rebellow their execrations against me as a 
Rebel from my Infancy and a Plotter of Independence 
more than half a hundred years ago. 

10. The present Ruling Party in the United States, 
will renew, repeat and redouble their curses and sarcasms 
against me, for having meditated the Ruin and destruction of this Countr)% from a Boy, from a mere Chicken 
in the Egg shell, by building a Navy, under pretence of 
protecting our Commerce and sea ports, but in reality 
only as a Hobby Horse for myself to ride and to increase my Patronage. For there can be no doubt that 
the Boy, though not yet twenty years old, and though 
pinched and starved in a stingy Country School, fully 
expected to be King of North America and to marry 
his Daughter to the Prince of Wales and his son John Quincy to the Princess Royal of England. 

11 . There can be no doubt, that this Letter, puerile 
and childish as it is, will make a distinguished figure 
in the Memoirs of my Life. A grave and important 
question arises on a point of Clironologj* : whether it 
should be inserted in the month of October 1755 the 
time of its Birth or in the month of April 1807, the 
time of its resurrection. As you have advised me to 
write my own Life you must resolve this question for 
me, for it is too perplexed for my Judgment to determine. 

12. You may depend upon its authenticity for I have 
copied it from the original, to ever)' word and almost 
every Letter of which I can attest, and so might any 
one else who should compare it, with this from the similarity of hand and composition. 

13. Vive La Bagatelle. 

Now sir, to be serious : I do not curse the dav, when 
I engaged in public affairs. I do not say when I became 
a Politician, for that I never was. I cannot repent of 
any Thing I ever did, conscienciously from a sense of 
Duty. I never engaged in public affairs, for my own 
Interest, Pleasure, En\y, Jealousy, Avarice^or Ambition 
or even the desire of Fame. If any of these had been 
my Motives, my Conduct would have been very different. 
In every considerable Transaction of my public Life, I 
have invariably acted according to my best judgment 
for the public good, and I can look up to God for the 
sincerity of my Intentions. How then is it possible I 
can repent. Notwithstanding this I have an immense 
Load of Errors, Weaknesses, follies and sins to mourn 
over and repent of, and these are the only affliction of 
my present Life. 

But notwithstanding all. Saint Paul and Dr. Barrow 
have taught me to rejoice evermore and be content. 
This Phrase "rejoice evermore'' shall never be out of 
my heart, memory or mouth again as long as I live, if I 
can help it. This is my Perfectibility of Man. 

Your " Palace of Ice" is a most admirable Image. I 
agree, that you and I have been employed in building a 
Palace of Ice. However if we did not believe it to be 
marble or silver or Gold or Ivory or Alabaster, or stone 
or Brick, we both thought it good sound white oak 
which would shelter its Inhabitants from the Inclemency 
of the Weather and last a long time. But the heat of 
the Climate in Summer has proved it to have been Ice. 
It is all melted to Water. 

All Letters and Packetts to or from John Adams are 
exempted from Postage and the <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> Post Office

Dear Sir, — I return you the Letter of Edward Smith. 
Time may or may not unriddle this whimsical Mystery. 
It ought however in the mean time to put us on our 
guard against Intrigues. 

My not preserving a Copy of my Letter to Dr. Nathan 
Webb [for he was a Physician] is no wonder: for I 
never kept a Copy of any Letter, till I became a Member of Congress in 1 7 74, The observation of your son 
Richard is very shrewd, and unfortunately for me very 
just. There are the same marks of haste and the same 
heedless inattention to style which have characterised 
all my writings to this day. 

I have always laughed at the affectation of representing American Independence as a novel Idea, as a modem 
discovery, as a late Invention. The Idea of it as a possible Thing, as a probable event, nay as a necessary and 
unavoidable Measure, in case Great Britain should assume an unconstitutional authority over us, has been 
familiar to Americans from the first setdement of the 
Country; and was as well understood by Governor 
Winthrop in 1675 as by Governor Sam. Adams when 
he told you that Independence had been the first wish 
of his heart for seven years. I suppose he dated from 
1768 when the Board of Commissioners arrived and 
landed in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> under the Protection of Nine Ships of 
War and four thousand regular Troops. 

A Couplet has been repeated with rapture as long as 
I can remember, which was imputed to Dean Berkley. 
The first Line I have forgot : but the last was ** And 
Empire Rises where the sun descends/* This was public 
many years before my Letter of Oct. 1755 to Doctor 
Webb. In 1760 Coll Josiah Quincy the Grandfather of 
Josiah Quincy now a Member of Congress from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, 
read to me a Letter he had then just received from a 
Mr. Turner I believe, one of the first mercantile Houses 
in London, congratulating him on the surrender of <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'><a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a></a> to General Amherst and the final Conquest of 
Canada **as a great event for America not only by insuring her tranquility and repose, but as facilitating and 
advancing your [Coll Quincy's] Countries rise to independence and empire." 

Within the course of the year before the Meeting of 
Congress in 1774 on a Journey to some of our Circuit 
Courts in Massachusetts, I stopped one night at a Tavern 
in Shrewsbury- about fort)' miles from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> : and as I 
was cold and wett I sat down at a good fire in the Bar 
room to dr&gt;' my great Coat and saddlebags, till a fire 
could be made in my Chamber. There presently came 
in, one after another half a dozen or half a score substantial yeomen of the Neighbourhood, who, sitting down 
to the fire after lighting their Pipes, began a lively conversation upon Politicks. As I believed I was unknown 
to all of them, I sat in total silence to hear them. One 
said " The People of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> are distracted." Another 
answered No wonder the People of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> are distracted ; oppression will make wise Men mad. A third 
said, what would you say, if a Fellow should come to 
your house and tell you he was come to take a list of 
your Cattie that Parliament might tax you for them at 
so much a head ? And how should you feel if he should 
go out and break open your barn, to take down your 
oxen, Cows, horses and sheep ? What would I say, replied the first, J would knock him in the head. Well, 
said a fourth, if Parliament can take away Mr. Hancocks 
wharf and Mr. Rows wharf they can take away your 
Bam and my house. After much more reasoning in 
this style, a fifth who had as yet been silent, broke out 
" Well it is high time for us to rebel. We must rebel 
sometime or other : and we had better rebel now than 
at any time to come : if we put it off for ten or twenty 
years, and let them go on as they have begun, they will 
get a strong Party among us, and plague us a great deal 
more than they can now. As yet they have but a small 
Party on their side/' I was disgusted with his word 
"rebel" because I was determined never to rebel as 
much as I was to resist rebellion against the fundamental 
principles of the Constitution whenever british Generals 
or Governors should beo^in it. I mention this Anecdote . 
to shew that the Idea of Independence was familiar even ! 
among the common People much earlier than some persons pretend. I have heard some Gentlemen of Education say that the first Idea of Independence was 
suggested to them by the Pamphlet Common Sense, and \ 
others that they were first converted by it to that Doctrine : but these were Men of very litde Conversation 
with the World and Men of ver)' narrow views and very 
little reflection. 

Your ennemies are only your would be rivals. They 
can never hurt you. Envy is a foul Fiend, that is only 
to be defyed. You read Sully. His Memoirs are a 
pretty specimen. Every honest, virtuous and able Man 
that ever existed, from Abel down to Dr. Rush, has had 
this enemy to combat, through Life. " Envy does merit 
as its shade pursues." You need not fear the charge 
of vanity. Vanity is really what the French call it, 
amour propre, self Love, and it is an universal Passion. 
All Men have it in an equal degree. Honest Men do 
not always disguise it. Knaves often do, if not always. 
When you see or hear a Man pique himself on his 
Modesty, you may depend upon it he is as vain a fellow 
as lives, and very probably a great Villain. I would 
advise you to communicate freely all the Compliments 
you have had or may receive from Europe. Defy the 
foul Fiend. Do not infer from this that I think there 
is no such thing as Modesty or Decency. On the contrary it is the Duty of every Man to respect the self 
love of every other Man, and not to disgust him by any 
ostentatious displays of his own. But in your case, 
surrounded as you are by jealous Competitors, always 
intriguing to depress you, it is your right and your 
Duty to mortify their invidious impertinence by a free 
communication of all your Trophies to your Friends, 
without any injunctions of secresy. 

I have not seen the Pamphlet entitled the dangers of 
the Country, but my Mind is deeply impressed with a 
sense of the Dangers of our Countries and all other 
Countries ; of France as well as England, Of all Countries there is none more to be pitied than France. England in my opinion is in a less dangerous situation than 
her Rival. 

The ominous dissolution of Morality both in Theory 
and Practice throughout the civilized World, threatens 
dangers and calamities of a novel species, beyond all 
Calculation : because there is no Precedent or Example 
in History which can shew us the Consequences of it 
Perhaps you may say Tyre and Sidon, Sodom and 
Gomorra are examples in Point. But we have no relations of their rise, progress or decline. You may say 
the old World, when it repented God that he had made 
Man, when it grieved him in his heart that he had made 
so vile a Creature is a Case in Point. I know not what 
to say in answer to this, only that the same authority 
we have for the fact, assures us that the World shall 
never be again drowned. I am my 

dear sir yours

Dr. Sir, — I received at an exhibition of Musick in 
our polite village of Mount Woollaston, on Thursday, 
your Letter relative to Mr. Loude, and sent it immediately to Dr. Tufts by his Lady, that the young Gendemans Friends might be informed of his situation. I 
lament the untimely decline of a youth, although I never 
saw him, who has been represented to me, as one who 
injured his health by too intense an application to study. 
I never heard his Name, but once when my Brother Cranch mentioned him to me, before he embarked on his voyage. 

And now I have mentioned my Brother Cranch, a 
Gentleman of fourscore, whose Memory is better than 
mine, I will relate to you a conversation with him last 
evening. I asked him if he recollected the first Line of 
a Couplet, whose second Line was •' And Empire rises 
where the sun descends." He paused a Moment and 
said 

The Eastern Nations sink, their glory ends 
And Empire rises where the sun descends. 

I asked him if Deane Bercley was the author of them. 
He answered No. The Tradition was, as he had heard 
it for sixty years, that these Lines were inscribed, or 
rather drilled into a Rock on the shore of Monument 
Bay in our old Colony of <a href='/results.php?city=plymouth' rel='city'>Plymouth</a>, and were supposed 
to have been written and engraved there by some of 
the first emigrants from Leyden who landed at <a href='/results.php?city=plymouth' rel='city'>Plymouth</a>. However this may be, I may add my Testimony to Mr. Cranch's that I have heard these verses 
for more than sixty years. I conjecture that Berkley 
became connected with them in my head by some re
port that the Bishop had copied them, into some publication. There is nothing in my little reading, more 
ancient in my Memory than the observation that Arts, 
Sciences and Empire had travelled Westward : and in 
Conversation it was always added, since I was a Child 
that their next Leap would be over the Atlantick into 
America. 

The Claim of the 1776 Men to the honour of first 
conceiving the Idea of American Independence, or of 
first inventing the project of it, is as ridiculous as that 
of Dr. Priestly, to the discovery of the Perfectibility of 
Man. 

I hereby disclaim all Pretensions to it, because it was 
much more ancient than my Nativity. 

Your Friend

Dear Sir, — I have received your favour of the ninth 
of this Month and conveyed to Dr. Tufts your Letter 
to him, who desires me to express to you the high sense 
he has of your Benevolence and Humanity to Mr. John Loude. The Doctor will write you as soon as he can 
find means for conveying to the Parents of that unfortunate Youth the money you enclosed. What shall we 
say, my Friend ? A pious and virtuous youth, struggling 
from his Cradle with Poverty, impressed with an unquenchable Thirst of knowledge, and through every 
difficulty forcing his way to universal Love and Esteem 
wherever he went, cutt off in his Career and thrown 
into the Grave, like an useless or a noxious Weed, 
when such Men as you and I can recollect in abundance, 
live to threescore years and ten and even fourscore and 
fourscore and ten ? This Child neither was guilty of 
Perjury to the Gods, nor Impiety to his Parents, nor 
Treason against his Country, nor Murder of his fellows, 
nor any of those Crimes, which ancient and Modern 
Phylosophers and Legislators have taught us to believe 
the most calculated to draw down divine Vengeance. 
He had no guilt directly nor indirectly in the Slave 
Trade. He was neither principal nor accessory, neither 
aider, abettor or accomplice in depriving any human 
Being of his Liberty, Life or Property. We must not 
ascribe his Misfortunes and Death, Vindictae Divinae. 
We must have recourse to our good Religion for the 
solution of the difficulty, for there only we shall find it. 

From Reflections like these the Transition is easy tp 
" The Danger of the Country," a Pamphlet for which I 
thank you and which I have read with great Pleasure 
and much advantage. It abounds with observations of 
the greatest importance and with Information much of 
which was new to me. 

I was provoked to hear it lately mentioned with a 
certain slight, and charged with declamation. The allusions might be to his reflections on the Slave Trade : 
and although there is not a word that he says upon that 
subject which I did not read with delight, I must acknowledge that I cannot concur in his Conclusions. 

That the Calamities of Europe are a punishment for 
her vices, I have not doubt. But she has sinned against 
the whole Decalogue and the Crimes of Sodom might 
be assigned as the procuring Cause of the anger of 
Heaven as well as the Slave Trade. We are too much 
byased by our self love and our private Interests and 
afTeclions as well as by our peculiar turn of thinking; 
and our Information is too contracted for us to be competent Judges of the designs of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> in the distribution of good and evil, Rewards and Punishments 
to Nations or Individuals in this World. I could adduce 
facts and arguments in a particular Case, to prove the 
interposition of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> to punish the enemies of 
one Man, as plausible as those of Mr. Stevens to shew 
that Bonaparte has been raised up to scourge the 
Traders in Slaves. I ought not to introduce my essay 
without something like a Preface. 

The saying of Vitellius that " the Body of a dead 
ennemy always smells well" was always as abhorrent 
to my moral sentiments as the expression was loathsome to my senses. I have often heard Dr. Franklin 
say that " one of the Pleasures of old age was to outlive ones ennemies." This sentiment also never failed 
to disgust and shock me. Possibly I might think there 
was more Inhumanity and Indelicacy in it than he felt 
or intended. But I have never allowed myself to rejoice 
in the Death of ennemies, and I know not that I ever 
heard of the death of any enemy without pain. If this 
could have been a source of pleasure to me, I should 
have had a surfeit of it. You will not suspect that I 
am weak or presumptuous enough to believe or even 
to conjecture that <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> has ever specially interposed to vindicate me or to discountenance my ennemies. 
The Thought strikes me with horror. Yet for what I 
know there may have been Fanaticks in the World, 
who would have flattered themselves that they were 
Favourites. 

Soon after I took my Seat in the Chair of the Senate 
as Vice President of the United States, a certain Edward Church, who made himself my enemy for no 
reason that I know of, unless it were because his Brother 
Benjamin was accused of Treason, published a scandalous and scurrilous Libel against me in verse, for which 
Washington ought to have punished him : but instead 
of frowning upon Wm he appointed him Consul at Lisbon, where his Conduct \i'as so bad that the Government 
complained against him, and he was removed and became 
a vagabond. A certain Loyd was then at New Yoric 
and was employed as I was informed to write Libells 
against me in the Newspapers. But he found so litde 
encouragement that he returned to England, where I 
soon heard that he ^I'as imprisoned in the Kings Bench 
and sett in the Pillory for Libells against the Government Greenleaf too a Printer of a Jacobin Paper in 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, who filled his Columns for years with libellous Paragraphs against me, was at length carried off 
by the Yellow Fever. In <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, a certain Peter 
Marcou, a drunken Poet, discarded by his father from 
all the apartments in his House but his kitchen, who 
was frequendy seen drunk and asleep in the Streets, 
was hired from time to time with Potts of strong Beer, 
by Andrew Brown, to step aside into a Closet in his 
House and write virulent Libells against me, for the 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> Gazette. It was not long before this insolent sott drank himself into his Grave. Andrew Brown 
himself when he first opened his printing office came 
out to Bush Hill in the most cringing manner to beg 
of me the Loan of Tom Paines Rights of Man, the 
two first Copies of which were received by me from 
Brand Hollis and Billy Franklin. He not only kept my 
Pamphlet which he solemnly promised to return, but 
immediately commenced in his Newspaper the most vilainous Course of Lies against me that his own Ingenuity 
added to that of the Toper Marcou could invent. 
Pickering who had him in his Power took him in hand 
and brought him to the most abject submission and the 
most solemn Promises of Amendment. But he could 
not long refrain from abusing me, till his House was 
burnt and his Wife and ' Children in it, and himself 
scortched to such a degree that he died in a few days. 
This looks the most like the Vindicta Divina, for some 
Crime or other. Benjamin Bteclfttoo in his Aurora, in 
revenge for Washingtons neglect of his Father and his 
Family was converted from a zealous Federalist to an 
abandoned Jacobin and became of course one of the 
most malicious Libellers of me. But the Yellow Fever 
arrested him in his detestable Career, and sent him to 
his Grandfather, from whom he inherited a dirty, envious, jealous and revengefull spight against me, for no 
other cause under heaven than because I was too honest 
a Man to favour or connive at his selfish schemes of 
ambition and avarice. Next to him I will mention John 
Fenno the younger, who after his Fathers death, threw 
himself into the arms of an English Faction, and with 
the utmost ingratitude to me, not only published his 
own abuses but the Libells of Macdonald the British 
Commissioner, and some of his Tools, such as Will. 
Smith and others. Well ! what became of John Fenno 
junior ? Why the Yellow Fever soon disposed of him. 
Cobbet too, from being a prodigious admirer of me 
became a Libbeller not only of you but of me. And of 
me for no other reason but because I would not involve 
my Country in a foreign and civil War, merely to make 
Alexander Hamilton Commander in Chief of an army 
of fifty thousand Men. This compleated Cobbets ruin 
in America, when he had once a prospect of making a 
fortune. Alexander Callender, for that I believe was 
his name, though he assumed that of Stephens Thompson Mason, his great Patron and Protector, to disguise 
his real name and Character, for I presume he was the 
Rascal who fled from a criminal prosecution in Scotland and left his Bail in the Lurch. This Fellow who 
knew nothing of me was bribed to publish the most infamous calumnies against me. His Fate is well known. 
Discarded by the Party who had bribed him, he became 
as arrant a Libeller of them and was evidently preparing to become the Instrument of his Co Patriot, his 
Brother Scotchman Alexander Hamilton, in order to 
procure him to be elected President of the United 
States. This Miscreant, after spending half his time in 
the lowest Intoxication in the streets, and in the vilest 
places, after getting his head broken and suffering 
every Insult was found drowned in the sea or a River 
whither he dropped in a fit or was plunged in by an 
enemy. 

Thus ended Callender, and his Namesake and Countryman Alexander Hamilton came to an end not much 
more to be envied. Of all the Libellers of me this was 
the most unprovoked, the most ungrateful and the most 
unprincipled. Under the most specious appearances 
and Professions, of the most cordial, respectful and 
affectionate attachment to me, and after having received 
a thousand favours and obligations from me, I have now 
evidence enough that he had concealed the most insidious schemes and plotts to undermine my reputation and 
deprive me of the favour of the Public. Finding he 
could not succeed in this, he took advantage of a moment of fermentation wickedly excited by himself and his fellow Conspirators to come out with the most false, 
malicious and revengefull Libell that ever was written. 
To this he had no Provocation but because I would make 
Peace with France, and could not in conscience make 
him Commander in Chief of an Army of fifty thousand 
men. But this Caitiff too came to a bad end. Fifteen 
years of continual slanders against Burr great numbers 
of which I heard myself, provoked a Call to the Field of 
Honor as they call it, and sent him, pardoned I hope in 
his last moments, to his long home by a Pistol Bullet 
through his spine. 

Burr, I never considered as my personal enemy. He would not have been my political enemy, if Hamilton 
would have permitted Washington to allow me to nominate him to the Senate as a Brigadier in the Army. 
But Burr must and would be something, and flectere 
sine queo superos Accharonta movebo, was as excusable 
a Maxim in him, as it was in Hamilton, McKean, Fred 
Muhlenbourg, Tench Coxe, and fifty more that I could 
name in one breath. Burr became my political enemy 
and Jeffersons political Friend, not from any affection to 
him or disaffection to me, but merely to make way for 
himself to mount the Ladder of Ambition. The most 
efficatious enemy and Friend to be sure he was. By 
intriguing with Clintons and Livingstons against Hamilton he turned the State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and consequendy 
the Ballance of the Continent. But what has been Burrs 
reward? It is doubtful whether Hamilton, Andrew 
Brown, or Alexander Callender, are so signal Monuments of divine vengeance and whether their destiny is 
not to be preferred to his. At the same time that I say 
this, I am not insensible of the Possibility that he may 
yet be President of the United States. 
I could swell this Catalogue to much greater Length, 
by enumerating Instances of Individuals and Parties who 
have been marked with signal Misfortunes after having 
been guilty of Injustice and Baseness to me : but thes6 
are enough. If I could take pleasure in the death or 
Calamities of my Enemies, I might have a surfeit of it. 
But I have not a disposition so vindictive : and if I had 
I would exert all my Philosophy and summon all my 
Religion to subdue and suppress it. 

Now let me ask you have I not proved that <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> has frowned upon my enemies by Fate as certain 
and arguments as conclusive as those by which Mr. Stevens attempts to prove the Calamities of Europe to 
be punishments for her sins against Africa. 

General Inferences should never be drawn from single 
Facts, or even from several Instances, especially in contemplating the inscrutable and incomprehensible Councils of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>. I should rejoice in the Prospect of 
the Abolition of the Slave Trade as sincerely as any 
Man : but I am apprehensive, if England suppresses 
their share of it, Napoleon at the head of France, Spain 
and Holland will not only monopolize it, but extend it, 
still more. 

I am affectionately yours

Dear Sir, — ^John Bunjan, if he had written my last 
Letter to you would have called it an history of Gods 
Judgments against Lyars and Libellers. Such indeed 
it seems to be. A great Number of others might have been added, and two or diree at least ought to have 
Phillip Freneau is one of the Number : but I know 
not in what Light to consider him. A Libeller he certainly was not only against me but against the whole 
Administration of the GoYemment at that time. But 
he seems to have been an instrument in the hands of 
others, and not well satis5ed with his employment or 
his employers. He has retired for many years into 
total obscurit}' ouxainly neglected by the Party which 
seduced him and I hope repenting of his wickednesSb 
If ths is the Case he ought to be k&gt;igiven by all whom 
he has urjured or ocended. as he oertainly has been 
long since by me. 

A certain man named Wood, undertook to writeand 
piini an History of my Administration in two octavo 
volumes. To be sure it was a Mass of Lves finom the 
lErst Page to the last. This Man has suSered a most 
righieons Punishment. — and such a Punishment as 
wioujd gradi}' my re\~enge if I had any. more than the

fTJiTTjue of a M&amp;n who t believe hi^ ;usdy ^cquiz^ 
the honourable Distinction of being the greatest Lyar I 
of the age. I am convinced he has written and printed ? 
more Lies than any Man in America at least. For 
eighteen or Nineteen years this Man, hardened in impudence has distinguished me with a course of his 
Calumnies. But what has been his reward ? I really 
know not a single Man of good Character who does 
not hold him in abhorrence, and many if not all the 
most sensible Men of his own Party cannot conceal 
their Contempt of him. He has received every Insult 
in the Streets, and his unconquerable Propensity to 
slander and his impudent refusal to give reasonable 
satisfaction, got him posted as a Lyar and Coward. 
Not having spirit to resent this himself he is said to 
have encouraged his son to attack Selfridge on Change 
who shot him upon the spot. It gives me pain to write 
this. But it ought to be considered by the slanderers 
a terrible Rebuke and Chastisement of his long continued and aggravated Guilt. 

Dennison has got his quietus : Duane and Cheetham 
have theirs to come, and they certainly will come. 

A certain John Williams who assumed the Name of 
Anthony Pasquin fled from the Laugh and the Wrath 
of England, and coming to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> became the Editor 
of the Democrat and afterwards of the Chronicle. He 
was soon siezed with the epidemical Distemper among 
Libellers, an ambition of the honour of venting Billingsgate against me. But even the Democratick 
Party, disgusted with his vileness compelled their own 
Newspapers to discard him. What is become of him 
I know not. Gifford and Erskine had stigmatized him 
to such a degree that I believe his Capacity to do mischief is at an end. 
I might have mentioned another, a David Williams, 
who as he told me had been upon very intimate Terms 
with Dr. Franklin in London. He came to see me in 
Grosvenor Square, but Dr. Price put me on my guard 
against him. He had been a Priest of the Church of 
England, but was unfrocked, if not excommunicated 
for his vices and Crimes and then became an Infidel 
filling his Writings with Contempt of the Christian 
Religion. In a Pamphlet of real Taste and Merit 
which he called Advice to a young Prince, he gave me 
a stab behind my Back with his Italian stilletto. 

He went to France and was praised by Madam Roland, 
but he was not a Man to succeed anywhere and I suppose made the French as weary of him as they were of 
Tom Pain. I could forgive these Williams's, profligate 
as they were to the rest of the World, for all the Injury 
they did me, for a smattering at least which they possessed of Classical Taste and Learning. 

The Rear of this black Host shall be brought up by 
Tom Pain. You know that I made the motion for his 
appointment to Congress to the Secretary to the Committee of foreign affairs, and carried it in opposition to 
Dr. Witherspoon who gave him publickly what has 
since been found to be his true Character, though at 
that time wholly unknown to me. His Gratitude to me 
for thus laying the foundation of his fortune, has been 
like all his moral sentiments and Conduct through Life. 

Immediately after the Publication of my " Thoughts 
on Government'' in 1776 since known as my Letter 
to Mr. Wythe, Tom came to my Chambers at Mrs. Yards, to rebuke me for my Pamphlet, and especially 
for recommending two assemblies in the Legislature, 
and more pointedly still for advising to a Negative on 
the Laws in the Executive authority. I vindicated my 
opinions in cool good humour with very solid Reasons, 
and then began to laugh at him in the same Straine of 
Pleasantry upon his ridiculous plan of Government in 
his Pamphlet called " common sense." You remember 
his Project was that afterwards adopted by Mr. Turgot, 
of all authority in one Center, a single Representative 
Assembly. I went farther and laughing in his face, 
asked him how he could be such a Pharisaical Hypocrite 
as to employ his thoughts through one other third Part 
of his Pamphlet, to prove from the Old Testiment that 
Monarchy was unlawful and solemnly prohibited by the 
Law of God. When he certainly must have sense 
enough to know that there was nothing like it in the 
Bible. Upon this he laughed out and said that he did 
not believe in the Bible, and added these memorable 
words ** I have had thoughts of publishing my sentiments upon Religion : but upon the whole I have concluded to postpone that subject to the latter part of 
Life.'* In some of his late Libells upon me. Pain 
alluded to this Conversation, and said that he had long 
suspected me, because I had found fault with his sentiments against Monarchy in his Pamphlet, Common 
Sense. The Provocation, however that excited his 
Malice and Revenge against me, was this. He went to 
England in 1787 I believe and carried with him a Copy 
of the new Constitution of the United States. He 
appeared to be very proud of it, and I was frequently 
disgusted with his Boasts to Stockdale and De Brett 
that he was the author of it. De Brett published it, 
from a Copy furnished him as he said by the author of 
it. Pain told me that it was taken from a Draught of 
his, which he gave to Governour Morris. I thought it would be no recommendation of it in England to have 
it pass for a Production of Tom Paine, a Tale which I 
did not believe. Pain however called several times to 
see me, and was invited to dine. His Conversation 
always disgusting was one day uncommonly vain, rude, 
and arrogant at Table, and in some dispute about 
Government he talked so much like a Villain and a 
Blockhead as to excite me to wrath, and I called him, 
not jocularly, but bona fide and in sober earnest " A 
Fool/' Although ** A Fool" he certainly was and ever 
has been, I must confess, that to call him so to his Face 
in my own house and at my own Table was such a 
violation of his Rights and my Duties of Hospitalit)*, 
that I would very readily ask his Pardon, even at this 
day if his pardon was worth having. Although he expressed no anger at the time he came no more to my 
house and I have never seen him since. He reser\^ed 
his Resentment for many years, and at last poured it 
out in Libells. As far as I am concerned I am ready 
to ballance the account by setting my calling him a 
Fool against all the Injuries his Libells have done me. 

But this is a Libeller whose guilt is of a deeper crimson than all the others. He has libelled, besides all 
the Souvereigns of the Earth, the Souvereign of the Universe, and to him I leave his Punishment or his Pardon. 

I have given you a Scroul of Wretches more worthy to be immortalized in Infamy by a Dunciad than all the 
Heroes of Popes exquisite Satyr : but if I had the Wit, and Talents of that great Poet, I would employ 
them to better purpose than by writing such a Book. 

I am affectionately yours

Dear Friend, — It is rare, that a Letter of yours remains so long upon my Table unacknowledged as has 
that of July 9th. Crudens Apophthegm is well worthy 
of your Remembrance and that of your Posterity for 
forty times forty years more. It is the only clue to the 
Labyrinth of the World ; the only Key to the Riddle 
of the Universe. "Some Crimes are punished to 
prove a <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> ; others escape to teach a future 
state/* In attempting to shorten it, I see I have weakened it 

When General Lee called Prudence " a rascally virtue" his meaning was good. He meant the spirit which 
evades danger, when Duty requires us to face it. This 
is Cowardice not prudence. Or he meant that subtilty 
which consults private Interest, ease, or safety, by the 
sacrifice or the neglect of our Friends or our Country. 
This may be Cunning, but is more properly called 
Knavery than Prudence. 

Your Complaint against the Director might be prudent and necessary and probably did much good by 
checking abuses, notwithstanding its apparent ill success. Caveat successibus apto, quisquis ab aventu 
facta notanda putat. Luther and Harvey were prudent, 
because they saw farther into the state of things than 
those who reproached them. You was prudent in discharging your own mind and Character of all responsibility for the Consequences of those errors in Theory 
and practice, which you saw prevailing in the management of the Yellow Fever. Those who gave their 
advice for a defensive War in 1775 had more carefully 
attended to the Character and Conduct of the Government and People of England on one hand, and the. 
People of the Colonies on the other, and had penetrated 
deeper into the designs and Power of both, than those 
who were afraid of War and advised against it. The 
Event has shewn that their prudence was consummate. 
Those who advised to early overtures of Friendship to 
France, had considered the State of France, humiliated 
by the Commerce and Naval Power of Great Britain, 
and the irresistable temptation which the opportunit)' 
presented to the former, to disarm the latter of half her 
Power and acquire a share of it to herself. They had 
better information and a clearer foresight, and therefore 
more Prudence than their Antagonists. You heard in 
Congress I believe in 1776 the debate between Mr. Dickinson and me upon the question of Independence. 
Recollect the arguments of both and then say, which 
of us discovered the most prudence. No honest Man 
can read the Historj'of your Executorship without pronouncing your conduct infinitely more prudent than 
that of your Colleague. 

Bv Prudence I mean tiiat deliberation and caution, 
which aims at no ends but good ones ; at good ones by 
none but fair means and then carefully adjusts and proportions its good means to its good ends. Without 
this virtue there can be no other. Justice itself cannot 
exist without it. A disposition to render to ever)' one 
his right is of no use without prudence to judge what 
is his right and skill to penbrm it. 

When in 1797, S and 9 I promoted the Fortification 
of our seaports, the Purchase of Na\y Yards, the Building of Na\y. &amp;c., I think I was more prudent than those 
who opposed me : thougli my Popularit)' was sacrificed 
to it, and my ennemies rose to Power by their imprudent 
opposition. Their Prudence, I agree with Lee, was a 
rascally virtue. 

I am anxious to see the Progress of Burr*s Tryal ; 
not from any Love or hatred I bear to the Man, for I 
cannot say that I feel either. He is, as you say a Nondescript in natural History. But I think something 
must come out on the Tryal, which will strengthen or 
weaken our Confidence in the General Union. I hope 
something will appear to determine clearly, whether 
any foreign Power has or has not been tampering with 
our Union. If it should appear that he is guilty of 
Treason and in Concert with any foreign Power, you 
and your twelve thousand Copetitioners might petition 
as earnestly as you did for Fries, if I was President, 
and the Gallows should not lose its prey. An ignorant 
Idiot of a German, is a very different Being from a 
Vice President of the United States. The one knew 
not what Treason was ; the other knows all about it. 
The one was instigated by Virginians and Pensilvanians 
who deserved to be hanged much more than he did. 
The other could be instigated only by his own ambition, 
avarice or Revenge. But I hope his Innocence will be 
made to appear, and that he will be fairly acquitted. 

War? or no War? That is the question. Our Monarchical, An ti republican Administration conceal from 
us the People all that Information that I a zealous Republican was always prompt to communicate ; so that we 
can only say "What can the matter be ?" If an express 
stipulation is demanded and insisted on by us, that our 
Flagg on board Merchantmen as well as ships of War 
shall protect all British subjects, Deserters from their 
Navy and all others, I am apprehensive the English will 
not agree to it. A little Prudence such as I have defined above might accommodate matters. But our 
People will not suffer their Government to be prudent. 
They w*ill clamour for the Protection and Hospitalit)^ of 
ever}' foreign Miscreant. Prudence would dictate that 
our Government should forbid all its Na\'al officers to 
recruit a Deserter from any Nation in any Case : and if 
the President has not the Power Congress should enact 
iL But our People have such a Predilection for Runaways of ever)* description except Runaway Negroes 
that I suppose Congress would think it too unpopular, 
to abridge this right of Man. 

How we shall get out of the scrape I know not I 
would not give up the Principle by any express stipulation. But I see no necessity* for stipulation on either 
side. The Principle is already sufficiendy established 
by the Law of Nations. And I think the Question 
might be waived by a litde skill and mutual understanding tho' I carrj' the Principle by the Law of Nations, to 
as great an extent as Mr. Jefferson does. 

If the Enorlish flv into a Passion and with or without 
declaring War seize ever\- ship and Cargo we have at 
sea, I dont believe our present Congress would declare 
War against them. I am sure they cannot consistendy 
with their avowed system, which is to defend Nothing 
but our Farms. If our Commerce is captured and our 
seaports destroyed, taken or laid under contribution we 
shall have a scene of universal distraction: but unless 
the People alter their sentiments, I see no Remedy. I 
do not believe however that any necessit)' exists to give 
a Colour to the Pretension of the English. They have 
the means of preventing the desertion of their own 
seamen. 

Parting with your Daughters and their suit must have 
been a tender scene in your Family, and the more affecting for the present critical state of our affairs. I have 
suffered these Pangs so often that I know how to sympathize with every sufferer in any such occurrences. 

We are so ready for War that many of our Country 
Towns have voted five dollars bounty and sixteen dollars pay a month to all their Proportion of the hundred 
thousand Militia. You may judge what a pleasant scene 
is opened to our view. We shall have the most cosdy 
army of Defenders that ever existed, in this world, or 
any other I believe. 

Your Fellow Citizens were disappointed as I am informed in not having you for their Moderator as they 
wished and intended. I think however you was right. 

I am as ever

Dear Sir, — I want to write an Essay. Whom shall 
I choose for a Model ? Plutarch, old Montaigne, Lord 
Bacon, Addison, Johnson, or Franklin ? The last, if he 
had devoted his Life to the study might have equalled 
Montaine in essays or La Fontaine in Fables ; for he 
was more fitted for either or both than to conduct a 
Nation like Rony or Colbert. I am however too round 
about to imitate the close, sententious manner of any 
of them. I am stumbled at the very Threshold. My 
subject is Disinterest or Disinterestedness. I must 
leave you to decide, for I cannot say which is the most 
proper word. 

Mirabeau said of LaFayette " II a affich^ desinteressement," and he added " this never fails.'* You know 
the sense of the word "affiche" ? It is as much as to 
say "he advertised" his Disinterestedness. That is 
equivalent to saying that he employed a Crier to proclaim through the streets O Yes ! O Yes ! O Yes I 
All Manner of Persons may have the benefit of my services, Gratis, provided allways and only, that they will 
yield me their unlimited and unsuspecting Confidence, 
and make me Commander in Chief of five hundred 
thousand Men, and after I shall have gained a few victories make me a King or an Emperor, when I shall 
take a fancy to be either. This has been the amount 
and the result of most of the Disinterestedness that 
has been possessed in the world. I say most, not all. 
There are exceptions and our Washington ought to pass 
for one. LaFayette imitated his example. So have 
Jefferson, Hamilton, Governor Strong, Fisher Ames and 
many others ; some with and others without success. 

Washington had great advantages for obtaining 
Credence. He possessed a great Fortune, immense 
Lands, many Slaves, an excellent Consort, no Children. 
What could he desire more for Felicity here below? 
His Professions therefore of attachment to private Life, 
fondness for Agricultural employments and rural amusements were easily believed : and we all agreed to believe him and make the World believe him. Yet we 
see he constantly betrayed apprehensions, that he 
should not be seriously believed by the World. He 
was nevertheless believed, and there is not an example in History of a more universal acknowledgment 
of Disinterestedness in any Patriot or Hero, than there 
is and will be to the latest Posterity' in him. LaFayette had not the same Felicity. His Fortune in France 
bore no proportion to Washingtons in America; and 
frenchmen had not the same faith with Americans, 
n the existence or Possibility of Disinterestedness, 
n any Man. His Professions therefore did not proluce such an enthusiasm as Washingtons. Jefferson 
esigned his office as Secretary of State and retired 
tnd his Friends said he had struck a great stroke to 
)btain the Presidency. I heard some of them say this, 
)articularly Edmund Randoph who was his great friend. 
The whole Antifederal Party at that time considered 
his retirement as a sure and certain step towards the 
ummit of the Pyramid ; and accordingly represented 
lim as unambitious unavaricious and perfectly disnterested in all parts of all the states in the Union. 
,Vhen a Man has one of the two greatest Parties in a 
elation, interested in representing him to be disinterested, even those who believe it to be a lie will repeat 
t so often to one another that at last they will seem to 
)elieve it to be true. Jefferson has succeeded, and 
nultitudes are made to believe that he is pure Benevoence : that he desires no Profit : that he wants no 
i^atronage : that, if you will only let him govern, he will 
ule only to make the People happy. But you and I 
enow him to be an Intriguer. Hamilton had great disidvantages. His original was infamous : his Place of 
3irth and Education were foreign Countries : his Forlune was Poverty itself: the Profligacy of his Life; his 
bmications, Adulteries and his Incests were propagated far and wide. Nevertheless he **affiched'* Disnterestedness as boldly, as Washington. His Mirmllons asserted it, with as little shame, tho' not a Man 
)f them believed it. All the rest of the World ridi:uled and despized the Pretext. He had not therefore 
:he same success. Yet he found means to fascinate some and intimidate others. You and I know him also 
to have been an Intriguer. Governor Strong retired 
and succeeded. He acquired the Reputation of being 
destitute of ambition and was chosen Governor by &amp;ir 
means and was a ver\- orood one. 

Ames miscarried. He was obnoxious to one Party, 
and by placing all his hopes on Hamilton, lost the Confidence of the soundest Portion of the other Pirty, and 
is now d)nng, as I fear, under the gloomy feelings of 
two disappointments. 

I have sometimes amused myself with inquiring where 
Washington got his S)-stem. Was it the natural Growth 
of his own Genius ? Had there been any examples of 
it in Virginia ? Instances enough might have been found 
in Histor)- of excellent H)*pocrites, whose Concealments, 
Dissimulations and simulations had decdved the world 
for a time. And some great examples of real disinterestedness, which produced the noblest effects and have 
alwa}*s been acknowledged. But yoM know that our beloved Washington was but ver\- superficially read in Histor\- of any age. Nation or Country. Where then did he 
obtain his Instruction ? I will tell you what I conjecture. 

Rollins ancient Historj- you know is very generally 
diffused through this Country-, because it has been and 
is in Enorland. The Readinor of most of our Men of 
Letters extends little further than this Work and Prideaux s Connection of the old and Xew Testament 
From Rollin I suspect Washington drew his Wisdom, 
in a great measure. In the third Chapter of the third 
Book, i.e. in the second volume page fortj- three, in the 
Histor}' of the Kingdom of the Medes, there are in the 
Character of Dejoces. several strokes, which are very 
curious^ as they resemble the Politicks of so many of our Countrymen, though the whole Character taken 
together is far inferiour in Purity and Magnanimity to 
that of Washington. " He retired from Public Business, 
pretending to be over fatigued with the Multitude of 
People that resorted to him." "His own Domestic 
affairs would not allow him to attend those of other 
People" &amp;C. " The licentiousness which had been restrained for some time by the Management of Dejoces, 
began to prevail more than ever, as soon as he had 
withdrawn himself from the administration of af&amp;irs, 
and the evil increased to such a degree, that the Medes 
were obliged to assemble, and deliberate upon the 
means of curing so dangerous a Disorder/' 

•' There are different sorts of ambition : some violent 
and impetuous carry every Thing as it were by storm, 
sticking at no kind of Cruelty or Murder : another sort 
more gentle, puts on an appearance of moderation and 
Justice, working under ground, and yet arrives at her 
pcnnt as surely as the other/* 

*' There is nothing certainly nobler or greater than 
to see a private Person eminent for his merit and virtue, 
and fiued by Us excellent Talents for the highest empkmnents, and yet thrcKigh indinatSon and OKidesty

Nothing can shew him so perfecdy worthy of that important Charge, as the opinion he has of his not being 
so, and his fears of not being equal to it But when 
he generously sacrifices his own quiet and satisfaction 
to the welfare and tranquility of the Publick, it is plain 
he understands what that Sovereign Power has in it 
really good, or truly valuable ; which is that it puts a 
Man in a Condition of becoming the Defender of his 
Country, of procuring it many advantages, and of redressing various evils ; of causing Law and Justice to 
flourish, of bringing Virtue and Probity into reputation, 
and of establishing Peace and Plenty : and he comforts 
himself for the cares and troubles, to which he is exposed, by the prospects of the many Benefits resulting 
from them to the Publick. Such a Governor was Numa 
of Rome, and such have been some other Emperors, 
whom the People have constrained to accept the Supreme Power." 

" It must be owned [I cannot help repeating it] that 
there is nothing nobler or greater than such a disposition. 

** He commanded his subjects to build a City, marking out himself the Place and Circumference of the 
Walls.*' " Within the last and smallest enclosure stood 
the Kings Palace. In the next were several appartments 
for lodging the officers. The Name of the City was 
Ecbatana,'* &amp;c. Tom Paine represents me as exulting 
at Washington " Is not this great Babylon that I have 
builded," &amp;c. The Scoundrel knew it was Washington 
and Jefferson that built this Ecbatana ; and he might 
have known that I opposed it in every step of its Progress and voted against it in Senate on all occasions. 
But Truth has no esteem in his eyes. No more. 
Tell me, has not our American System of Politicks and 
ambition been copied from this very passage ? If not 
from whence did it come ? Read the Chapter in Rollin. 
Washington was more sincere than Dejoces ; but I am 
persuaded he had read this description of him.

My dear Phylosopher and Friend, — I have, long 
before the receipt of your favour of the 31 of October 
supposed that either you were gazing at the Comet or 
curing the Influenza ; and in either case, that you was 
much better employed than in answering my idle Letters. Pray ! have our Astronomers at Phyladelphia, 
observed that stranger in the Heavens ? Have they 
noted its Bearings and Distances, its Course and 
Progress ? whence it came and whither it goes ? Or 
are Astronomers in America as rare as they are in other 
parts of the World ? Franklin has several times related 
to me an Anecdote concerning Astronomers in England. Government had occasion to send an Astronomer 
abroad upon some service. The Ministry asked the 
Royal Society to recommend one : they appointed a 
Committee to enquire for a suitable Character. Franklin who was one of the Committee, said that he and all 
his Colleagues, upon looking over the List of the Society 
were astonished to find how few had ever studied that 
Science. I am very much afraid that our scientific societies in America, are at least as deficient in Numbers 
of Students of the Universe and the sum of Things as 
England. Have our Physicians in Phyladelphia made any new observations on that horrid endemical Distemper that has employed you so much. It seems to have 
become a Complaint of every year, and of two or three 
times in a year. This last has been the most universal 
and the most irksome and the most unmanageable of 
any I ever knew. 

I presume the Lawyer whom you mention has founded 
his opinion upon that of Rochefaucault, Mandeville, 
Hobbs, Machiavel, and I had almost said Tacitus, that 
there is no such thing in Nature, actual or possible as a 
disinterested action, and that the Testator must have 
been non Compos, when he supposed such a Thing possible. Brother Lawyer! thou art not sound. Thou 
hast no Faith in Virtue ! Butler, Hutchinson or even 
Shaftesbury might have taught thee Better. Perhaps 
you will say that God alone can judge, what is or is 
not a disinterested action. Though this is true in an 
absolute sense, yet Men can judge according to their 
best information and discernment, and if the Testator 
made his Executor the judge, he must determine according to his own understanding and Conscience. I 
should deprecate a solemn Judgment of any Court, 
that such a Legacy was void. 

Self taught or Book learned in the Arts, our Hero 
was much indebted to his Talents for "his immense 
elevation above his Fellows." Talents ! you will say, 
what Talents ? I answer, i . An handsome Face. That 
this is a Talent, I can prove by the authority of a 
thousand Instances in all ages : and among the rest 
Madame DuBarrj- who said Le veretable Royaute est 
la Beaute. 2. A tall stature, like the Hebrew sovereign chosen because he was taller by the Head than 
the other Jews. 3. An elegant Form. 4. Graceful

modes: :n Con: 


Washington of course was extolled without bounds. 

7. Washington was preceeded by favourable Anecdotes. The English had used him ill in the expedition of 
Braddock. They had not done Justice to his Bravery 
and good Council. They had exaggerated and misrepresented his defeat and Capitulation ; which interested the 
Pride as well as compassion of Americans in his favour. 
President Davis had drawn his Horroscope by calling him 
•'that Heroic Youth, Col. Washington." Mr. Lynch of 
South Carolina told me before we met in Congress in 
1774 that ** Colonel Washington had made the most 
eloquent speech that ever had been spoken upon the 
Controversy with England, viz That if the English should 
attack the People of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, he would raise a thousand 
Men at his own expense and march at their head to New 
England to their aid." Several other favourable stories 
preceeded his appearance in Congress and in the Army. 

8. He possessed the Gift of Silence. This I esteem as 
one of the most precious Talents. 9. He had great 
Self Command. It cost him a great exertion sometimes, and a constant Constraint, but to preserve so 
much equanimity as he did, required a great Capacity. 
10. Whenever he lost his temper as he did sometimes, 
either Love or fear in those about him induced them to 
conceal his Weakness from the World. Here you see 
I have made out ten Talents without saying a word 
about Reading, Thinking or writing, upon all which 
subjects you have said all that need be said. You 
see I use the word Talents in a larger sense than usual, 
comprehending every advantage. Genius, Experience, 
Learning, Fortune, Birth, Health are all Talents, though 
I know not how, the word has been lately confined to 
the faculties of the Mind. 

Did not Ratcliff Give a Library to the University of 
<a href='/results.php?city=oxford' rel='city'>Oxford</a> ? He had Wit at will. Riding one day by a 
new brick building, he saw the scaffolding give way 
under a Mason who was laing Bricks and the work 
which had been laid following the scaffold, buried the 
workman and crushed him to death. Ratcliff cried out 
before the Man or the Bricks had reached the ground 
** Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord for they 
cease from their Labours, and their works shall follow 
them.*' A thousand other stories are told of his wit. 
Whether he read or not he affected to be a profound 
Metaphisician. I read in England, at Mr. William 
Vossalls of Clapham, in Manuscript, a Demonstration of 
Atheism written by this Dr. Ratcliff, as abstruse and 
profound as the writings of Condorcet. The writer at 
least seemed to think it profound, or to wish that 
others might think it so ; but it was a miserable piece of 
Sophistry, worthy of Diderot. 

I admire the subject of your intended Lecture. A 
story goes of our Universalist Murray, It is said that 
more than twenty years ago he preached upon the subject of Animals in a future State and asserted that they 
would all be saved, even down to the Ladies Lapdogs. 
He told the Ladies they need not fear the loss of their 
favourite animals, for he could assure them that even 
Bounce should wag his Tail in Glory. I once told 
Murray the story and asked him if it was true. Ah ! 
said Murray, you will hear a thousand such stories 
about me. 

Pray cannot you contrive to get the Trees and Plants 
into a future state too? I should like to think that 
Groves and Forests, Apple, Peach, Pear, and Plumb 
trees oranges &amp;c., might be seen in the abodes of the 
blessed The Earl of Shelboume's Bishop Watson, 
while he was still a Chymist, which I wish he had been 
to this day, printed a ver&gt;' respectable Pamphlet, to 
shew that Vegetables were animated He did not publish it, but I made interest enough with him to obtain a 
Copy of it. Who knows but vegetables and animals 
are all in a course to become rational and immortal 
There is room enough in the universe. Hershell digs 
up Starrs in the heavens, fixed Starrs, all suns with 
Planetts, Satilites and Comets, layer after layer and 
stratum under stratum, ten million times faster and 
more numerous than my Men dig Potatoes out of the 
Earth. Why should we set limits then to our benevolence, or the predominant benevolence in the Universe. 
Let Sensibilit}', Animation, Intelligence, Virtue and 
Happiness be universal, with all my heart Think not 
that I am laughing. I assure you I soberly approve 
your subject and your manner of treating it as far as 
you have communicated it to me. 

Now for that resolute word " No." I ought to have 
said No to the appointment of Washington, and Hamilton and some others : and yes to the appointment of 
Burr, Muhlenburg and some others. I ought to have 
appointed Lincoln and Gates and Knox and Clinton 
&amp;c. But if I had said yes and no in this manner the 
Senate would have contradicted me in every Instance. 
You ask what would have been the Consequence. I 
answer Washington would have been chosen President 
at the next election, if he had lived, and Hamilton 
would have been appointed Commander in Chief of the 
Army. This would have happened as it was, if Washington had lived and this was intended. With all my 
Ministers against me, a great Majorit)^ of the Senate, 
and of the House of Representatives, I was no more at 
Liberty than a Man in a Prison, chained to the floor and 
bound hand and foot, an Idea that was once held up 
by a Parson Burr of Worcester an ancestor of Aaron as 
I suppose, as an illustration of human Liberty. I was 
perfectly at Liberty to stay there. I have given you 
Paradoxes enough under this word No. But I will 
justify any of them if you desire it. Washington ought 
either to have never gone out of Public Life, or he 
ought never to have come in again. 

I have a great Curiosity to know what Richard saw 
and heard at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> which it is not lawfull to tell. 
Symptoms of a Corruption allarming to the Friends of 
national Liberty appear in every Part of our Country. 
They will have their usual course and their usual termination. We are like other Men.

My dear Philosopher and Friend, — I thank you for 
your printed Lecture on the Humanity, CEconomy and 
other Virtues which require of us more attention to 
our Domestick animals and especially to their diseases. 
We see our Horses, horned Cattle, Sheep, Swine, and 
other species as well as our Cats and Dogs, sick or 
wounded and no body knows what to do with them or 
for them, so that a broken bone or a fit of sickness is 
almost certain death. The animal economy in all of 
them is in general I suppose nearly the same in them as 
in us, and the Science of Anatomy and Medicine might 
be studies in the same manner in their Cases and in ours. 

The Clamour in your City is too late. Pensilvania 
may thank herself for the evil she feels. She has not 
only established the permanent residence of Congress 
at Washington but she has established a perpetuity of 
absolute Power at the southward of Potomack under 
which, however she may complain, she must suffer. 
The Union is not a pallace of Ice, nor a Castle of 
Glass. There must be an intense heat to melt it, and 
very hard blows to break it. One war will not dissolve 
it. Deep and Strong are its roots in the Judgment 
and hearts of the People. A dozen Hamiltons and 
Burrs will be killed in Duels or hanged before the 
Union will be broken. Washington believed bona fide 
that the Federal City would be the Nexus utriusque 
Mundi, and bind together not only the Northern and 
Southern States, but the Transalleganian with the 
Adantic States. How far his Interest and the consideration of the rise in the value of his Lands might 
influence him in the formation of this opinion I leave to 
the Searcher of all hearts. My Judgment was in favour 
of an established Residence at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and I consequently voted against every Project of a permanent 
Residence and a federal City, till Mr. Robert Morris 
deserted me, and left me in a minority or rather made 
a Majority in Senate, and left me without a vote. 

*' Great Abilities," "extraordinary Abilities,*' "great 
Talents," "Brilliant Talents," ''Splendid Talents,** 
" Extraordinary Man," ** The most extraordinary Man 
that this or any other age has produced," ** Acute and 
elegant Mind," ''able and eminent Man," "Overwhelming Eloquence, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.," are the modest 
epithets, which became the commonplace expressions 
concerning every Virginian from Patrick Henry and 
R. H. Lee down to J. Randolph and Mr. Munroe. 
Huzza for Virginia ! 

Knowing as I did the humanity, delicacy and Piety 
of your sentiments on the subject of Duels I felt so 
much distress for you and your Family that I could not 
write you for fear of renewing your Grief. I rejoice 
with you in the alleviations of it you have received. 
Your son was remarked when he was in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> for his 
manly discretion among his Brother Officers, Instances 
of which were repeated to me, by a Gentleman who 
was once present and observed it with pleasure. The 
Custom is too much considered as a Law especially in 
the Army and Navy. It is certainly a remnant of a 
barbarous superstition but whether the world will ever 
be rid of it, I know not 

The Resemblance you remark between the arguments 
in 1774 and 1775 and this time really exists. Who will 
argue and what will be the arguments in favour of 
the Sovereign of the World to apply to Napoleon, the 
epithet which Dryden applies to Alexander, in his 
Feast ? The Dutch once declared War against England, France, and Spain all at once, and fought them all 
with great Intrepidity. Shall we follow their example ? 
fight them all with 240 Gun boats ? 

I wish you would cure our Rulers of the Hydrophobia? Yet, if they should get well of it now, it 
seems to be almost too late. I suppose they have 
thought with Gen. Lee that Prudence was a rascally 
Virtue. I wish their Inattention and want of Foresight 
may not expose them to Capture and Imprisonment by 
the Enemy, as his did him. If ever a Nation was 
guilty of imprudence, ours has been so in making a 
Naval Force and maritime preparations unpopular. 
But any thing, no matter what, to turn J. A. out and 
come under the Dominion of Virginia. Huzza again 
for Virginia! Hail Massachusetts, <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and 
Pensilvania! Sacrifice loyally your Commerce and 
dank your Chains in harmonious Concert with Virginia ! 
She tells you that Commerce produces money, monej' 
Luxur)' and all three are incompatible with Republicanism! Virtuous, simple, frugal Virginia hates Money 
and wants it only for Napoleon, who desires it only to 
establish Freedom through the World ! 

My Friend the times are too serious. Instead of 
the most enlightened People, I fear we Americans shall 
soon have the Character of the silliest People under 
Heaven.

My dear Philosopher, — Your two last Letters have puzzled me. In one you tell me that your Citizens are clamourous against the Residence of Congress at 
Washington. Now Washington was the Father of the Columbian Territor)-, the Cit)' of Washington and the 
Residence of Congress in it ; and Washington, Jefferson 
and L* Enfant were the Triumvirate who planned the 
City, the Capitol and the Princes Palace. In your last 
Feb. 18 you tell me, that your Citizens are making 
preparations for celebrating a kind of adoration to 
Divus Washington. How can these two Clamours be 
reconciled? The Celebration of the Birthday I can 
account for, by Blounts Motion to repeal the Funding 
system, because Hamiltons adulation can be supported 
only by Washington's adoration. Another obvious 
Motive is to cast disgrace upon Washingtons two successors, Adams and Jefferson. Similar Motives have 
produced a Phenomenon in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. On the fourth of 
July Washingtons Picture is placed behind the Table 
of the Principal Magistrates, Hamiltons opposite to him 
in the most conspicuous spot in the whole Hall while 
the Pictures of Samuel Adams and John Hancock are 
crowded away in two obscure corners. This is Fanuel 
Hall which ought to be as sacred in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, as the 
Temple of Jupiter was on the Capitol Hill in Rome 
made the Head Quarters of Fornication, Adultery, 
Incest, Libelling and electioneering Intrigue. Yet 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> is the head Quarters of good Principles. One 
of the most superb Blocks of Brick Buildings too, 
erected lately by the richest Man in the Town is called 
Hamilton Place, and twenty other proud Palaces deserve 
the name as well. 

The Clamours against the Embargo are no doubt 
intended to disgrace Jeffersons administration. France 
and England had embargoed our Trade before we embargoed it. No prudent Merchant would send a ship 
to sea, unless she had the Mark of one or other of the 
Beasts, perhaps both, for some are capable of making 
their Court to both. 

My old acquaintance King George has broke his 
word. He promised me he would be the last to disturb our Independence. But his Tyrannical Proclamation for impressing seamen from our Merchant Ships is 
a flagrant disturbance of our Independence. He has 
selected the hereditary Remnant of the old Butran 
Administration for his Ministry and they are reviving 
his old feelings. We must revive ours. 
Charge as much Ignorance, Folly and Pride as you 
please upon the City of Washington. But lay none of 
it to me. Not one shilling was spent upon it by me. 
I could not get Wires put up to my Bells when I lived 
in the Royal Palace. 

You ask how different were our Feelings and Conduct in 1774? Different indeed. We then loved Liberty better than Money. Now we love Money better 
than Liberty. Then Liberty meant security for Life, 
Liberty Property and Character. Now the word has 
changed its meaning and signifies Money, electioneering, Tricks and Libels, and perhaps the Protection of 
French Armies and British Fleets. 

When my Parson says " Let us sing to the praise 
and Glory of G. W/' your Church will adopt a new 
Collect in its Liturgy and say " Sancte Washington ora 
pro nobis.*' 

But you know that all this adulation in the Leaders 
of it, is sheerly hypocritical. It would have added at 
Washington a Mausoleum of an hundred feet square 
at the base, and an hundred feet high to the other 
Monuments of "Ignorance, Folly and Pride*' to be left 
in that place when Congress shall remove from it. 

I told my Friend Powell of Virginia at my own Table, 
that if that Bill for a Mausoleum passed I should be 
obliged to do the most unpopular act of my whole unpopular Life, by sending it back with a Negative and 
Reasons. Oh ! said Powell I hope not 

I hope that when Anarchy shall invade us, it will 
stumble on that Rock and break its shins. 

At the time of Hamiltons Death, the Federal Papers 
avowed that Hamilton was the soul and Washington 
the Body, or in other words that Washington was the 
painted wooden head of the ship and Hamilton the 

Pilot and steersman. 

Thus the World goes, has ever gone, and ever will 

go. And so let it go.

Dear Rush, — I have your favour of the 5th. My 
dear Mrs. Adams bids me present her friendly regards 
to you and Mrs. Rush and all your family, and to say to 
you that she has read your Letter with pleasure excepting what relates to a Gentleman for whom she had before a great Esteem, and all she can say upon that 
subject is that she wished she had not read it. 

In my jocular prayer to the saint I meant no reflection or insinuations against your Church or any 
other. 

I shall esteem you the more for having become a 
Christian on a large scale. Bigotry, Superstition and 
enthusiasm on religious subjects I have long since sett 
at Defyance. I have attended public Worship in all 
Countries and with all sects and believe them all much 
better than no religion, though I have not thought myself obliged to believe all I heard. Religion I hold to 
be essential to Morals. I never read of an irreligious 
Character in Greek or Roman History, nor in any 
other History, nor have I known one in Life, who was 
not a Rascal. Name one if you can living or dead. I 
shall be very glad to receive your Creed as you give me 
encouragement to hope. 

You have heard the mercantile Maxim **If it is necessary in the Course of commerce to send a ship 
through the fire, you must run the risque of burning 
your sails." Not all the Politicians of the World, the 
Pharisees, the Jesuits, the Bramins, the Druids, the 
Romans, the Carthaginians, the Britons or the French, 
have ever employed more Subtilty in Negotiation than 
Merchants. We may depend upon it that every device 
that human wit can conceive will be employed to evade 
the embargo. The 2&gt;1 Cargoes of Flour at the Havanna 
therefore are no surprise to me. I fear that a practice 
and habit of smuggling too, will be introduced by this 
irksome stagnation. 

Tell Mrs. Rush that Mrs. A. and Mr. A. felicitate 
themselves in Retirement but not much for that retirement. We have both been enough at sea to know that 
the Midshipman and even the Passengers and common 
sailors in a leaky, crazy ship in a Hurricane in the 
Gulph Stream, are as anxious as the Captain and the 
Helmsmen. The higher Duty and the greater vigilance 
and activity, are a relief from terror, rather than an increase of it. I know not that I was ever more attentive 
to public affairs, or more concerned about them. You 
and I have been deceived in conceiving too high an 
opinion of the sense and ^Honesty of our Nation. We 
are driven up in a corner, can retreat no further. 
Bayonetts and cannon mouths are at our Bosoms. We 
are insulted and injured, ridiculed and scorned by the 
Belligerent Powers. We have no Defence prepared 
by sea and Land ; and all this because Tench Coxe and 
a few other foolish knaves like him would have it so, 
and the People would say amen. 

Mr. Jefferson has reason to reflect upon himself. 
How he will get rid of his remorse in his Retirement I 
know not He must know that he leaves the Government infinitely worse than he found it and that from his 
own error or Ignorance. I wish his Telescopes and 
Mathematical Instruments, however, may secure his 
Felicity. But if I have not mismeasured his ambition, 
he will be uneasy and the sword will cutt away the 
scabbard. As he has however a good Taste for Letters 
and an ardent curiosity for Science, he may and I hope 
wiU find amusement and consolation from them ; for I 
have no resentment against him, though he has honoured 
and salaried almost every villain he could find who had 
been an enemy to me. 

Our People will not suffer the Constitution to operate 
according to its true Principles, spirit and design. The 
Presidents office ought to mediate between the rich and 
the Poor. But neither will have it so, each Party will 
have the Executive, and Judiciary too wholly and exclusively to itself. The Consequence has been and will be 
that our Government is a Game of Leap frog. Once 
in a dozen years there will be a Revolution in Administration. The Democrats will reign for about that Period, 
and make the President their slave, then the Aristocrats 
will leap over their backs and shoulders, and reign in 
their turn making the President their Machine. I think 
instead of opposing systematically any administration, 
running down their Characters and opposing all their 
Measures right or wrong, we ought to support every 
administration as far as we can in Justice. For my part 
I always thought and am still determined to support 
every administration whenever I think them in the right. 
I care not whether they call me Federalist, Jacobin or 
Quid, 

That elegant Monument which your Friendship has erected to the Memory of Dr. Rebman has given much 
pleasure to your 

Friend and servant 

J. Adams, 

P.S. — I have omitted to answer your close question, 
** Whether such a Country is worthy of the Patriotism 
of honest Men?" I answer, such a Country is as 
worthy as any other Country. Our People are like 
other People. Our obligations to our Country never 
cease but with our Lives. We ought to do all we can. 
Instead of being Frenchmen or Englishmen ; Federalists 
or Jacobins, we ought to be Americans and exert ever)nerve to convince and persuade our Country to conquer 
its sordid stinginess, to defend our exposed Cities and 
prepare a Naval Force. This must be our ultimate resort. The miserable struggle for place and power, must 
be laid aside, and heart and hand united for defence. 

The Judgments of heaven cannot be averted, but 
Dr. Rush can mitigate the yellow Fever, and he can 
do much to guard against that avarice which is our 
national sin, which is most likely to draw down Judgment. An Aristocracy of Wealth, without any Check 
but a Democracy of Licentiousness is our Curse. I 
wish that Aristocracy was in a hole, guarded by Hercules with his Club on one side and an honest People 
with their Millions of hands on the other. The eternal 
Intrigues of our monied and Landed and Slaved Aristocracy, are and will be our ruin. I will be neither 
Aristocrat nor Democrat, without a Mediator between 
the two. With such a Mediator I will be both. Answer 
me candidly to this.

My dear Physical and Medical Philosopher, — 

I give you this Tide for the present only. I shall scarcely allow you to be a political, moral, or Christian 
Philosopher, till you retract some of the Complaints, Lamentations, Regrets and Penitences in your letter of the 13th. But more of this presendy. 

Mr. John Reed, the first Lawyer who left a great Reputation in our State, in the administration of Governor Shirley was a Councillor, or in the style of that 
day, one of his Majesty's Honourable Council, according to our Charter. Shirley proposed a Law, that was inconsistent with Liberty and the public good, and Reed 
who was a Man of great Integrity and Fortitude, as well as Talents opposed it with such unanswerable reasons as prevailed with the Council to reject the .Bill. 
Shirleys sychophants, a numerous host, were in such a rage, that at the next election they exerted themselves in Caucus's and Intrigues so successfully that they 
turned out Father Reed, as he was then called. After the Result of the Election was declared, the old Gendeman coming down the stairs from the Council Chamber 
met one of his Friends and said to him '' I am dead, and it is well with me." My son may say the same for the same reasons. 

Our good old Massachusetts has undergone an instantaneous Conversion. Last year the Federalists 
were about Ninety in four hundred and fifty. This year 
they have a Majority, of about the number of the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> 
seats. Have you never known or read of a good, 
sober honest religious Man, who had passed his days 
in general in rational Piety and steady virtue, who falling in his old age into bad Company had become a litde 
debauched both with Wine and Women, till all of a 
sudden some great Calamity befidling him he was instantaneously converted into a flaming Fanatic and became a furious Persecutor of all his old sober Friends. 
Just so our good old Massachusetts, for a few years 
past has been declining into the rankest democratical 
Debauchery ; but the embargo, like a Plague, Pestilence 
or Famine, has awakened her from her vicious dream 
and turned her into a furious persecuting enthusiast for 
hyper federalism . 

Now sir, for your Groans. You and I in the Revolution acted from Principle; we did our Duty, as we 
then believed, according to our best Information, Judgment and Consciences. Shall we now repent of this ? 
God forbid ! No ! If a banishment to Cayenne, or to 
Bottany Bay or even the Guillotine were to be the 
necessary Consequences of it to us, we ought not to 
repent Repent ? This is impossible : how can a Man 
repent of his virtues ? Repent of your sins, and Crimes 
and willfull Follies, if you can recollect any : but never 
repent of your Charities, of your Benevolences, of your 
Cures in the Yellow Fever, no, nor of the innumerable 
hazards of your Life you have run, in the prosecution 
of your duty. 

I can say with you, that I do not r^nret my sons rejection from the next Senate nor his Resignation of this. 
His Resignation I (iilly approve. A station in public 
Life is not desirable at this time, though perhaps a Man 
ought not to refuse it when called to iL 

You ask. in case of a Rupture with Britain or France; 
iriiat shall we ^^t for ? I know of no better answer 
to give than this» to get rid of the embargo. This object as I understand the Politicks of the times is worth a 
war with all the World. But where are we to trade, 
when we are at war with all the world ? 

My friend! Our Country is in Masquerade! No 
Party, No Man dares to avow his real sentiments. All 
is disguise, Visard, Cloak. The people are totally puzzled and confounded. They cannot penetrate the views, 
designs or objects of any Party or any Individual. If 
I was only forty year old, I would as I did at that age, 
sett all Disguise and fear at Defyance, and once more 
lead my Country. But now it would be Madness in me 
to attempt any Thing. I have not any Confidence in 
my own Judgment. My Strength of Body and Capacity 
of application to Business or study, are gone. But 
such is the Constitution of my Mind that I cannot avoid 
forming an opinion. It is happy and fortunate I believe 
for my Country, that I have no call to explain myself. 
But I have an opinion that there is but one course for 
my Country to pursue in the present Crisis. That 
course I would indicate to you if I could converse with 
you in secret Confidence, but I ought not to put it on 
Paper. I even doubt whether you would agree with 
me. I know not whether one Man in the Union would 
support me. Indeed I fear that the critical moment is 
past 

Our Constitution operates as I always foresaw and 
predicted it would. It is a Game at Leap-frog. The 
Federalists ruled for twelve years, by very small Majorities : then the Republicans leaped over their heads 
and shoulders and have reigned seven years : it is even 
uncertain whether their Dominion will last another year : 
but every appearance indicates that it will not continue 
beyond twelve years, when the Federalists will leap over their heads and shoulders again. Thus from twelve 
years to twelve years we are to have a total revolution 
of Parties : and the Principle seems to be established 
on both sides that the Nation is never to be governed 
by the Nation ; but the whole is to be exclusively governed by a Party. Integrity is as Tacitus says Certissimum exitium, most certain destruction, and Impartiality is Treason. 

You ask " shall we rally round the standard of a 
popular Chief?" I know not whom you mean. I am 
determined to rally round the standard of the President^ 
as far as I can in honour, whether Mr. Pinkney, Mr. Clinton or Mr. Madison be the Man. I will engage in 
no systematical and universal opposition to any Man. 
We must rally round our Government or be undone. 
Since the death of Washington, you say there has been 
no center of Union. But what Center was Washington ? He had unanimous votes as President, but the 
two Houses of Congress and the great Body of the 
People were more equally divided under him than they 
ever have been since. Jonathan Dickenson Serjeant 
and Dr. Hutchinson would have turned him out of his 
House, if the yellow fever had not been sent to save 
him, and a Majority of the People of the Union would 
then have applauded Genet, untill John Quincy Adams 
turned the Tide of popular fury and Delusion. Never 
was Man under greater obligation to another, than 
Washington was to that youth, and no Man was more 
sensible of it, than Washington himself, as I can prove 
by indisputable evidence. 

Commerce and Wealth have produced Luxury, 
Avarice and Cowardice. Luxuria incubuit, victamque 
reluscitur Britaniam. Our bedollared Country has become a Miser and a Spendthrift, alien! appotens sui 
profusus. Former ages have never discovered any 
Remedy against the universal Gangrene of avarice in 
commercial Countries, but setting up Ambition as a 
Rival to it. Military Honours have excited Ambition, 
to struggle against Avarice, till Military Honours have 
degenerated into hereditary Dignities. You and I have 
no Military Ambition, nor any great Wealth, and both 
of us wish that Ambition and Avarice may be restrained 
by Law, and be subservient to Liberty. But Nature 
will have her Course and Corruption is coming in like 
a flood, accellerated by English Influence in the greatest 
degree and by French Influence in a very considerable 
Degree, and still more by the eternal internal struggle 
between Debtor and Creditor, which has overturned 
every Republic from the Beginning of time. 

You have puzzled me with an enigma, which I pray 
you to explain. You say the Quids have united with 
the Democrats in favour of Snyder, because J. Q. 
Adams was left out of the Senate of U. S. Pray unriddle this. What connection could there be between 
my sons election and the election of your Governor ? 
Did my old Friend McKean and his whimsicals whom 
you call Quids consider J. Q*s rejection as a Tryumph 
of Republicanism, and take Courage from it to join in 
it ? or as a Tryumph of Federalism, and intimidated by 
it join the Republicans to check the Progress of it I 
have not Penetration enough to see through it. 

Family regards as usual.

Dear Benjamin, — Handsome Bradford of thy City, allarmed me the other day at our Athenaeum in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, by telling me, that Dr. Rushes Business had amazingly 
encreased and was encreasing. Knowing thine ardor in thy Profession, I was apprehensive that thy zeal for 
the health of the sick would soon eat thee up^ and consequently that thine Ether would escape from this 
of Humanity to the Regions of Divinity before mine. As Charity " commence par soi-meme," I charge thee from regard to my own self as well as thine own self to 
take care of thine own health, in preference to that of any of thy Patients. 

But to change the style a litde — not much. I look at 
the Presidential election as I do at the squabbles of little 
Girls, about their Dolls and at the more serious wrangles 
of little Boys which sometimes come to blows, about 
their Ratdes and Whisdes. It will be a mighty Busde 
about a mighty Bauble. 

In one of your Letters you say that one half the People think the Government too strong and the other half 
too weak. The Truth is it is too strong already, without being just. In the hands of Aristocrats it has been 
too strong without being sufficiently wise or just: in the 
hands of Democrats it has been too strong without 
being either wise or just Wisdom and Justice can never 
be promoted till the Presidents office instead of being a 
Doll and a Whisde, shall be made more independent 
and more respectable : capable of mediating between 
two infuriated Parties. Till this is done, the Government will be ride and tye, a game at leap frog, one Party 
once in eight or twelve years leaping over the head and 
shoulders of the other, kicking and spurring when it 
rides. 

If the President must be the head of a Party, and not 
the President of the Nation, we have no hope of long 
escaping a civil Contest. 

You jusdy observe that the embargo operates in 
favour of a Revolution of Power. That is the Embargo 
will enable the Aristocrats to leap over the heads and 
shoulders of the Democrats, as Taxes &amp;c. enabled the 
Democrats eight years ago to leap over theirs. But if 
the Aristocrats get the Power how will they use it? 
Will they submit to the Proclamations, Orders in Council &amp;c. of the English, and go to war with France, Spain, 
Portugal, Holland, Italy, Germany, Prussia, Denmark &amp; 
Russia. Such a war I think would be worse than the embargo. Though my system has always been Neutrality 
and I have sacrificed every Thing to it yet I have always 
been convinced that it was our true Policy to preserve 
as long as possible a good understanding with France, 
and that if we were driven to extremities, we had better 
preserve Peace with France. Notwithstanding this I 
would not bear Insult and Injury from France. If we 
get into a Quarrel with France, and the war Passions 
are once excited between our People and the People of 
France and her allies, our Presidents will be mere statholders danced upon British Wires. All Naval Defence will be discountenanced as it has been in Holland 
since King William, and we shall have no Commerce 
but the Miserable Pittance which British Avarice will 
allow us. 

Though the Life of Hamilton will be a made up Picture, like Dean Swifts Coelia, and Rags will be contrived 
to prop the flabby dugs lest down they drop, I shall be 
very glad to see it I hope his famous Letter which 
produced the Army, the Sedition Law &amp;c., in which he 
recommends an Army of fifty thousand Men, ten thousand of them Horse, will not be omitted. 

The Death of Dr. Shippen has revived many scenes 
in my Mind of ancient times. In more modern days he 
was too much of a Virginian to care much about me. 
His son too, became a Democratic Dunce, though he 
had been under obligations to me in England as another 
Father. 

I thank you for the two Pamphlets. Mr. Cuthberts 
is ingenious but I do not agree with him. Your Medical Department shines with great Glory. I wish ours 
at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a> would emulate you but I despair of it. 
Mark I do not wish yours worse, but ours better than it 
is. So I am not guilty of envy. 

My Family all salute yours, all yours. 

The Coup de Theatre. 

The Aristocratical Tricks played off in the Funerals 
of Washington, Hamilton and Ames are all in Concert 
with the Lives and Histories written and to be written, 
all calculated like Drums and Trumpets and Fifes in an 
Army to drown the unpopularity of speculations, Banks 
Paper Money and mushroom fortunes. You see through 
these Masks and Veils and Cloaks, but the People are 
dazzled and blinded by them and so will Posterity be. 
The Aristocrats know how to dupe the Democrats better 
than the latter to deceive the former, though both will 
lie with the most invincible front. 

Adieu 

<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">J. Adams</a>.

I have read Spences " Britain independent of Commerce." Who could have expected to see the Doctrine 
of Artaxerxes, Aristotle, Mr. Lock and Dr. Quesnay conjured up by a British Ministry to reconcile the People to 
their Measures? The Principle seems to be the same 
with Harringtons political Axiom, that Mankind are led 
by the Teeth and that Dominion follows the Ballance of 
Property in Land. The foundation is true, but the 
superstructure erroneous. Agriculture must be encouraged by Manufactures, and both by Commerce. 
The three by their reciprocal Action and Reaction on 
each other, produce national Prosperity. I doubt however whether we for want of Manufactures, can say that 
America is independent of Commerce, so truly as the 
English. 

This our beloved Country, my dear Friend is indeed 
in a very dangerous situation. It is between two great 
fires in Europe, and between two ignited Parties at 
home, smoking, sparkling and flaming ready to burst 
into a Conflagration. In this state of embarrassment 
Confusion and uncertainty, no Genius appears : no comprehensive mind : no exalted Courage. What shall we 
do ? What will become of us ? To you and me these 
Things are of little Consequence. But we have Children and Grand Children and shall soon have Great 
Grand Children. And indeed the Nation ought all to 
be dear to us, and tenderly cherished as our offspring. 

The embargo is a cowardly measure. We are taught 
to be cowards both by Federalists and Republicans. 
Our Gazettes and Pamphlets tell us that Bonaparte is 
omnipotent by land, that Britain is omnipotent at sea : 
that Bonaparte will conquer England, and command all 
the British Navy, and send I know not how many hundred thousand soldiers here and conquer from New 
Orleans to Passamaquoddy. Though every one of these 
Bugbears is an empty Phantom, yet the People seem to 
believe every article of this bombastical Creed and 
tremble and shudder in Consequence. Who shall 
touch these blind eyes ? The American People are not 
Cowards nor Traitors. 

J. A.

My dear Sir, — Instead of preparing for Commencement I am answering your delicious Letter of the 24th. 
But where to begin or where to end ! I will follow your 
own order. 

If I had ever heard that a Pen of Tacitus had been 
preserved among the Reliques of antiquity, I should 
swear you had stolen it to draw the Character of the 
most conspicuous moral political and military Phenomenon of the age. I tremble not however at his name. 
All the ships in Europe he can procure, could not transport an Army to hurt us. I see in him a Conqueror, 
who resembles Alexander, Caesar, Mahomet and Kouli 
Khan and the vices. Follies and Madness, as well as the 
Genius, Courage and desperation, which belonged to 
them all. In attention to the Arts and Sciences he is 
equal to any of them. His Religion and Morality are 
very like that of all of them. I see nothing in him so 
very much superior to Dumourier or Pichegru, or 
several others, of the Generals now under him. The 
Impetus of the Revolution, setting all things at Defyance operated like a Steam Engine to bend the Character of the french soldiers to the severest military disdpline the world ever witnessed. All dus was done and 
the french Nation and armies formed by the national 
assemblies and their Committees to the most absolute 
submission before he came to the Command. With these 
instruments he has defended himself against a series 
of Coalitions and Combinations against him. In one 
Point he has been more hardy and impudent than Caesar 
or Cromwell : he has thrown off a Masque which they 
were obliged to wear and openly avowed his personal 
and Family ambition. But what is he now ? I believe 
him to be the most miserable Individual of the human 
species. He must be conscious that he is brandishing 
a Beetle round his head upon the Pinnacle of a Steeple. 
His whole system must crumble under him. He is contending with England for a superiority of Power, a glittering object for which the English and French Nations 
have incessantly wrestled and fought for many ages. It is 
in vain to say the English are acting in self defence, for so 
is Napoleon, and he is in more danger than the English. 
The Truth is the English are contending to be the dominant Power of the World, or if you will for universal 
empire as much as the French. The Trident of Neptune is the Scepter of the World ; and that unlimited 
Despotism on the ocean for which Britain avowedly and 
openly contends would be a more dangerous Domination over the civilized World than any that Napoleon 
ever can accomplish. 

What is now the Power of Napoleon ? Compare it 
with that of the House of Austria under Charles the 5th. 
and his successors. The Contention between the House 
of Austria under Charles and the House of Bourbon 
under Francis kept Mankind in a fire as consuming as 
this in our day. Charles as ambitious and restless as 
Napoleon ran about Europe by sea and Land setting 
up and pulling down as notably as the Frenchman or 
Corsican. No longer ago than 1630 The Successor of 
Charles was Master of Spain, Portugal all the Treasures 
of America, the Low Countries, the Milanese, the Kingdom of Naples, of Bohemia, of Hungary, and even 
Germany was become his patrimony. All this was a 
greater Power by far than Napoleon now possesses. 
The Cry of universal Empire was as loud then as it is 
now. 

Compare the Power of France now to that of Louis 
14th. who was hated and dreaded by all Europe as much 
as Bona is now, and whose armies of 400 thousand Men 
bore a greater proportion to the standing armies of 
Europe then, than those of France do now, and whose 
Generals Conde, Turenne, Villars, Luxembourg and 
many others were equal to any of Napoleons. Not to 
trouble you to read many books to refresh your memory, 
only run over the 14th. Chapter of Voltaires age of 
Louis 14 and see the Pride of the Monarch and the 
terror of the world. His Navy was then terrible even 
to the English, and his armies invincible till Marlborough 
checked him as I hope some gallant English or Spanish 
officer will the Napoleons. 

Compare the Napoleons with the Capitian Rou in 
the time of Charlemaine who had as vast views as much 
skill in arms and Policy and was as cruel as the present 
Hairbrain.

Perceptions. Retentions* Judgment, Reason, Passions, 
Imaginations and Prejudices, in comfJaisance to him. 
Whoever he is I pronounce him a weak Man too. He 
never was c2^&gt;able of understanding even me. I never

there is one such Magistrate, there will be two or three. 
The U. S. will be divided into two or three sections, and 
all of them become vassalls to Uropean Powers. Call 
them statholders if you wilL Another Thing ! Whenever there is an hereditary* ChieC there must be an 
hereditary* Senate to check him, or he will soon be either 
guillotined like Charles i and Louis the i6or become a 
Deq&gt;ot, like Napoleon. If I had not been a weak Man 
I should have explained myself, so as to be better understood : and if your Man had not been a weak Man 
he would have understood me better. All I have contended for, has been that the first Magistrate should 
be made so respectable and so independent as to be 
able to mediate between the two great Factions of Aristocrats and Democrats which always has existed and 
always will tear Mankind to Pieces. Here I want but 
have not time, to introduce a new Theory of Vanity 
which I have discovered. If I should not forget it, I 
may hereafter explain it. It would be somewhat to the 
Purpose in this place. 

The Nomination to the Treasury of the Mint, is one 
of the actions of my Life, which I have ever recollected 
with the most entire satisfaction, though it made me about thirty nine enemies and among the rest Frederick 
Augustus Muhlenbourg. 

Every spriggof Laurell you receive at home or from

be another Benefaction to Mankind, I doubt not.

I once said, in answer to a Virginia address that it 
would depend upon Virginians to determine, whether 
we should have a Faction to crush and humble. Virginians did determine, and the Faction was crushed 
and humbled in dust and ashes. Every Man convicted 
was obliged to pay Fines and Costs, to Germans the 
severest of Punishments, and four of them were obliged 
to obtain twelve thousand Petitioners for their Lives. I 
think this was dust and ashes, expressly as they were all 
obliged to confess their faults, express their penitence 
and promise Reformation. Shall I mention the names 
of Virginians and Pensilvanians who fomented this 
Insurrection ? If you desire it, I will.

Mt deak Fja£!a&gt;, — I -mill not stand iipon Ceremonies vitb you and vait for the Return of a Msii, or an 
answer to my last Lener. 

Wliate^'er proportian of Loyally to an establisbed 
Dinasty of Kings, or vbaierer taint of caxboLc superstition there may be in the present sensations of the 
Spanish People; or however their Conduct may have 
been exdted b\- British or Austrian Goli I revere the 
Mixture of pure Patriotism that appears to be in :i and 
mseparable from it : and I wish to know the sentiments 
of your Pensilvanian Statesmen concerning it. 

The Contest between the Houses of Austria and 
Bourbon in the beginning of the last Centur\\ for the 
succession to the throne of Spain is welj known. Phillip the 5th. and Charles the sixth were Ri\^s, as Ferdinand the 7th. and Joseph the isL are now. Charles 
was supported by the Emperor, England and Holland 
and Phillip by France and her Allies. The Earls of 
Gallovayand Peterborough ran about Spain with Armies 
at their beds and proclaimed Charles at Madrid and 
many other Places, till Louis 14th. and his Grandson 
Phillip were in despair. In this situation Vauban the 
great Teacher of Fortification and one of the profound 
statesmen as well as honest Patriots of France, proposed to his Court to send Phillip to reign in America, 
that the Commerce of Mexico and Peru might be secured to the French. The English seem to have 
adopted this Project of Vauban and to aim at securing 
the Commerce of South America to themselves. Have 
your <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> Politicians considered what will be the 
Consequence of this to the United States ? How will 
it affect our Louisiana Claims, our West India Commerce ? I am almost afraid to ask so bold and hazardous a question, as whether it will not make France the 
natural Ally of the U. S. 

The Inclination of the Spaniards were in favour of 
Phillip and the fortitude of the Castillians turned the 
scale in his favour. They made great efforts when they 
found him in danger. It is a very arduous enterprise 
to impose upon a Nation a King in spight of their Taste. 
The Austrians, the Dutch, the English and the Portuguese were harrassed in Spain, suffered for want of 
provisions and were consumed by degrees. 

By some accounts certain Provinces in Spain have 
proclaimed Prince Charles. This looks like a desire to 
revive the old Connection of Spain with the House of 
Austria, which might check the House of Napoleon for 
the present, but would lay a foundation for interminable 
future wars in Europe. 

Is there room to hope that the French will meet with 
effectual obstructions in Spain ? How will they procure 
Provisions ? Not by sea. The English fleet is in the 
way. By Land from France and Italy will be almost impossible, and die Spaniards have not Onions and Turnips enough for themselves. An army of two or three 
hundred thousand Frenchmen will consume a great 
lany Bushells. The Spaniards had better fight and 
lie in Battle, than perish with Famine. 

These occurrences In Spain open wide views to those 
irho have more Information and Sagacity than I have, 
rhey will give Trouble to Napoleon, employ a great part 
)f his force and be a powerful temptation to Nations 
[ie has humbled to avenge their disgrace. The French 
have always been chased out of Italy. Germany and 
the North of Europe must be allarmed at the Prospect 
of having Spain and the Indies in the Power of the 
Corsicans. In short I know not but the Spaniards may 
produce in England a Marlborough, and in Germany a 
Eugene to give Napoleon a Fistula, what think you ? 

I have always called our Constitution a Game at Leap 
frog. New England is again converted to Federalism. 
The Federal Administration lasted twelve years. The 
Republicans then leaped over their heads and shoulders, 
and have ruled eight years. They may possibly hold 
out four years more and then probably the Federalists 
will leap again. But neither Party will ever be strong 
while they adhere to their austere exclusive Maxims. 
Neither Party will ever be able to pursue the true Interest, honor and Dignity of the Nation. 

1 lament the narrow, selfish spirit of the Leaders of 
both Parties but. can do no good to either. They are 
incorrigible. We must adopt the Dutch Motto, Incertum quo Fata ferant.

Dear Sir, — That Rosicrusian sylph, diat Fairy 
Queen Mab, or that other familiar spirit whatever it is, 
that inspires your nightly dreams, I would not exchange, 
if I had it, for the Daemon of Socrates. You have more 
wit and humour and sense in your sleep, than other 
People I was about to say, than you have yourself when 
awake. I know not whether I have ever read two finer 
allegories than the two you have given me from your 
nocturnal slumbers. I agree well enough with you in 
the moral of them both. 

I believe with you, " a Republican Government," 
while the People have the virtues, Talents and Love of 
Country necessary to support it "the best possible 
Government to promote the Interest, dignity and Happiness of Man." But you know that Commerce, Luxury 
and avarice have destroyed every Republican Gk&gt;vemment. England and France have tryed the experiment, 
and neither of them could preserve it for twelve years. 
It might be said with Truth, that they could not preserve 
it for a Moment ; for the Commonwealth of England 
from 1 640 to 1 660 was in reality a succession of Monarchies under Pym, Hambden, Fairfax, and Cromwell. And 
the Republick of France was a similar monarchy under 
Mirabeau, Brissot, Danton, Robespierre, and a succession of others like them down to Napoleon the Emperor. The Mercenary spirit of Commerce has recendy 
destroyed the Republicks of Holland, Switzerland, and 
Venice. Not one of these Republicks however dared 
at any time to trust the People with any elections whatever, much less with the election of first Magistrates. 
In all these Countries the Monster Venality would instantly have appeared and swallowed at once all security of Liberty, Property, Fame and Life. 

When public virtue is gone, when the national spirit 
is fled, when a Party is substituted for the Nation, and 
faction for a party, when venality lurks and skulks in 
secret, and much more when it impudently braves the 
public Censure, whether it be sent in the form of emissaries from foreign Powers, or is employed by ambitious 
and Intriguing domestic Citizens, the Republic is lost in 
essence, though it may still exist in form. The Form of 
a Senate is still preserved in Rome. The Prince Rezzonico was presented to me in London under the Title 
of " Senatore di Roma." But what sort of a republick 
is Rome at present ? 

When Commerce and Luxury and Dissipation had 
introduced Avarice among the Greeks, the artfuU Policy 
and military discipline of Phillip and his son, prevailed 
over all the Toils, Negotiations and Eloquence of Demosthenes. The People, who in virtuous times, or if 
you will in times of national Pride had set the Hosts of 
Persia at Defyance, now sold themselves and bowed 
their necks to the yoke of a petty Prince of Macedonia. 
And poor Demosthenes, abandoned, persecuted while 
he lived was pursued to an ignominious Death, as the 
only Reward of his Patriotism. Immortal Glory has 
followed his eloquence : but this he could not enjoy 
while he lived : and we know not that he enjoys it since 
his death. I hope he has enjoyments superiour to 
this. 

The same Causes produced the same effects in Rome, 
and the Labours, Eloquence and Patriotism of Cicero, 
were to as little purpose as those of Demosthenes, and 
were equally rewarded. 

We Mortals cannot work Miracles : we struggle in 
vain against the Constitution and Course of Nature. 

Americans, I fondly hope and candidly believe are 
not yet arrived at the age of Demosthenes or Cicero. 
If we can preserve our Union entire we may preserve 
our Republick. But if the Union is broken we become 
two petty Principalities litde better than the Feudal 
ones, one of France and the other of England. 

If I could lay an embargo or pass a new importation 
Law against Corruption and foreign Influences, I wouW 
not make it a temporal but a perpetual Law, and I 
would not repeal it, though it should raise a Clamour as 
loud as my Gag Law or your Grog Law or Mr. JefTersons embargo. 

The Majorities in the five states of New England, 
though small are all on one side. <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> has fortified the same Party with half a dozen Members, and 
anxious are the expectations from New Jersey, Pensilvania and Maryland. There is a body of the same 
party in every other state. The Union I fear is in some 
danger. Nor is the danger of foreign War much diminished. An alliance between England and Spain is 
a new aspect of Planets towards us. Surrounded by 
Land on the East, North, West and South by the Territories of two such Powers, and blockaded by sea by 
two such Navies as the English and Spanish, without a 
Friend or Ally by sea or Land, we may have all our 
Republican virtues put to a Tryal. 

I am weary of Conjectures but not in despair.

My dear Sir, — The three Classes of People in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, who direct our public af&amp;irs are the same as those 
you describe in your &amp;vour of 22 of Sept 

It gives me great pleasure to learn that our old 
Friend Mr. Clymer is as he always was a pure American. I cannot however boldly defend the long Continuance of the embargo. I thought it at first a necessary 
Measure, but was fully apprehensive it could not be 
long continued. I am neither an advocate nor an 
accuser of Mr. Jefferson without discrimination. I can 
acquit him of Partiality to Napoleon, but not entirely to 
the french Nation. I have long known his bias to the 
French and his bitterness to the English. Of Napoleon 
I have reason to believe he thinks justly. 

Mr. Jefferson in my opinion has long ago adopted 
two very erroneous opinions, i. That England was 
tottering to her falL That her strength and resources 
were exhausted. That she must soon be a Bankrupt 
and unable to maintain her naval superiorit&gt;\ This I 
never believed and we shall yet have proofs enough and 
to spare of her tremendous Power, though I dread it 
noL Tom Paines Reflections on the Rubicon and his 
other Prophecies of British Ruin I personally know 
were Mr. Jeffersons opinions and continued to be so 
even when he was V^ice President 2. But the second 
opinion was still more erroneous and still more fatal. 
He did not study the French Nation, nor consider the 
Character of her Court, her Nobilit)', her Clergy, her 
Lawyers, her Institutions, and much less the nature of 
her common People, not one in fifty of whom could 
write or read. He had studied so litde the nature of 
Man and still less the nature of Government, that he 
came from France and continued for years, fully persuaded that the Nation would establish a free Republican Government and even a levelling Democracy, and 
that Monarchy and Nobility would be forever abolished 
in France. I have reason to remember these Things, 
for I have heard him assert them and enlarge upon them 
with the utmost astonishment. I have reason to remember them moreover, because these were the first Topicks 
upon which we ever differed in opinions upon political 
subjects. I have reason to remember them too because 
his opinions recommended him to the French Revolutionary Government and Nation, and especially to all 
the Friends, Ambassadors Consuls and other agents as 
well as to all other Frenchmen in America, even to Talleyrand and the Duke de Liancourt, who all exerted all 
their influence and all their Praises to exalt Mr. Jefferson 
over my shoulders, and to run me down as an Aristocrat 
and a Monarchist. I have reason to remember it too 
because my opinion of the French Revolution, produced 
a coldness towards me in all my old Revolutionary 
Friends, and an Inclination towards Mr. Jefferson, which 
broke out in violent Invectives and false imputations 
upon me and in flattering Panegyricks upon Mr. Jefferson, till they ended in a consignment of me forever to 
private Life and the elevation of him to the Presidents 
Chair. My Writings were but a Pretext. They knew 
that neither Aristocracy or Monarchy were recommended to this Country in any of them. 

December 19th. 1808. Thus far had I written, on 
the loth. of October and had planned in my head a 
Letter to be composed of more History and of observations upon my Friend Mr. Whartons Prophecies, 
which I found would take four or five sheets of Paper 
and this Idea frightened me. Tell Mr. Wharton that 
the Prophecies in the Old and New Testament were not 
intended to make us Prophets. 

Your Favour of December 14 has reminded me of 
the Project I had begun. My right hand has not been 
palsied by Pain or sickness, to such a degree as to be 
wholly incapable of holding a Pen, nor have I ceased to 
contemplate the Crisis of our affairs. Nor am I fearful 
of committing my Thoughts to Paper. I could trace 
back our errors, but to what purpose? It would be 
weakness to exult over my ennemies. It would be vanity 
to sett up my own system as the only one that could 
have saved us. When a Man has been led by a Will 
with a Whisp into a salt pond and has sunk like Marius 
up to his Chin in mud, it would be madness to waste his 
time in Disquisitions on the Nature and Properties of 
those Meteors, in questions whether they are composed 
of Sulphur, or Mephitic Air or fixed air or Phosphorus 
or what else. The Question first in order, and which 
demands immediate attention is. How shall he get out ? 

To what Purpose, my Friend, is it for me to give my 
opinion, when every appearance indicates that it will not 
be followed now any more than it was in 1800. My 
opinion will not be regarded by any or either Party. 

Si velis Pacem para bellum, is by the Federalists said 
to be Washingtons Doctrine. So it was and so it has 
been the Maxim of every Patriot and Hero and indeed 
of every Man of sense, who knew the Power of Jealousy 
and Envy in the human breast, since Cain murdered his 
Brother because he was a more pious Man and more 
approved by his Maker than himself. 

My system has always been to prepare for war so far as to fortify our most important and most exposed Places 
on the Frontier and on the Seaboard, and to prepare 
for war by sea so far as to build Frigates and other 
smaller vessels Schooners and Brigantines, by degrees 
as our Revenues could afford, so that in case of an 
unforeseen rupture our immense Commerce might not 
be all liable to be swept at once into the Coffers of our 
Ennemies. To what use are 100,000 Militia to defend 
our Merchandise at sea? To what end are 2 or 300 
Gun boats to protect our Commerce ? For what purpose are Ten thousand regular Troops on the Continent 
of America, for the protection of our ships in the Mediterranean the Baltic the English Channel the Bay of 
Biscay, or the West Indian or East Indian oceans? 
The embargo I presume must be relaxed. If not it will 
either produce a general violation of it, which will cost 
more than foreign war to suppress it, or it will turn out 
of office, at least in New England every Man who supports it. There will not be a select Man nor a Representative left who will advocate the administration. The 
same spirit will increase in the middle and even in the 
southern and western States. Mr. Madisons Administration will be a Scene of Distraction and Confusion if 
not of Insurrections and Civil War, and foreign war at 
the same time both with France and England if the 
embargo is not lightened. Why then are not orders 
given to equip and Man all the Frigates we have and 
to build more in all our great seaports ? 

It is in vain for me who stand unconnected and alone, 
the object of the jealousy and aversion of both Parties, 
to repeat the opinion which I have uniformly held and 
always inculcated for more than thirty years that a Navy 
is our natural and our only Defence. It is infinitely 
more economical as well as consistent with our Liberties 
than any other. But as long as the People are encouraged in that penurious spirit which will hazard 
anarchy, foreign and domestic war, rather than pay the 
expense of wooden walls, though these are infinitely 
cheaper than regular Troops or Militia which can do 
nothing we must be the sport of Fortune. 

The Chapter of Accidents can alone save us. Those 
who believe that that Fortune and that Chapter of Accidents are under a wise controul, as you and I do must 
have recourse to their Religion and that alone for their 
Comfort. 

My opinion of Embargoes, Non Importation and Non 
Exportation Agreements, Non Intercourse Laws, Non 
Importation Laws &amp;c., &amp;c., has never varied. In 1774 
Congress was unanimously sanguine two only excepted, 
that the Non Importation Agreement would procure the 
ample redress of all our Complaints. I went with the 
rest because the People everywhere were of the same 
opinion. But at that very time I said, in conversation 
with " The greatest orator that ever spoke" as Mr. Randolph calls him, ''I look upon all this as labour lost 
These Measures will be despized and we must fight" 
" By God" said P. Henry ** I am of your Mind." When 
Mr. Madison sent up to Senate his Resolutions of Non 
Importation, I decided the Question in a divided Senate 
against them. When the present embargo was laid I 
was of the same opinion, that we could give Laws neither 
to England nor France by such means. Yet I have 
raised no clamour against these Measures, being determined to support the Government in whatever hands as 
far as I can in Conscience and in honour.

My dear Sir, — I know not whether I shall make you 
smile or weep, excite your ridicule or pity or contempt 
when I reveal to you the mister)^ of my long delay to 
answer your last Letters. But before I unriddle that 
unusual negligence. I must say a few words concerning 
our Friend Whartons Attachment to Prophecies and his 
habit of applying them to passing events. I have no 
objection to the Study, but I am aware of extream 
dangers in applying the Predictions to Characters and 
occurrences as they appear or approach, and before they 
are complete and at an end. Public Men especially 
would make wild steerage were they to judge of Men 
and things, by their sense of the Prophecies. 

Politicians, such as Pharisees, Machivilians and Jesuits 
have often employed interpretations of the Prophecies 
to excite superstitious Princes and enthusiastic Nations 
to engage in enterprizes, in no wise calculated for the 
good of Mankind. The Crusades which lasted two 
hundred years intoxicated all Europe and cost the Lives 
of three millions of Men were excited and supported by 
the Prophecies. The French Prophets too excited great 
troubles and brought horrible Persecutions upon themselves as well as great Calamities upon others by their 
presumptuous Prognostications. The Dissenters in 
England, some of them I mean and Dr. Tower among 
others, contributed I fear to assist and propagate that 
democratical Fury which desolated France and has subjugated the continent of Europe, and came very near 
producing in England a Revolution similar to that of 
France. 

The most Atheistical Philosophers of France and of 
Europe encouraged in secret this engine to work upon 
popular Credulity and excite popular passions. 

Bonaparte and his Politicians are manifestly holding 
out the Idea of the Restoration of the Jews to Jerusalem, 
and this delusion preceeded and accompanied his expedition to Egypt, and is still propagated far and wide. 
Fabers very fashionable Book I consider as a mere 
British political Pamphlet calculated to excite religious 
abhorrence in England against Napoleon. The Man 
may be pious and sincere, so might Archbishop Sand 
for what I know, but sincerity in error cannot convert 
it into Truth, and a Mans Passions, Prejudices and even 
his Patriotism often induce Men to adopt opinions without sufficient evidence. 

It grieves me to relate an Anecdote of our Friend 
Dr. Priestley whom I greatly esteemed and sincerely 
loved, though I think he was seduced by a hot headed 
Friend Cooper to injure me very grossly. At Breakfast with me alone when I was Vice President, he talked 
very freely of the French Revolution and with great 
satisfaction. I heard him a long time in silent wonder, 
but in perfect good humour, till at last, when he pauzed, 
I asked him very cooly ** Dr. Do you really believe that 
tlie French Nation will succeed in establishing a free 
Government?" He answered me with a good natured 
smile ** Yes I do believe they will.** I then enquired 
" Upon what principles and by what Reasons do you 
ground your opinion ? Is not all experience and all 
History against it?" "Why I fear it is," said the Dr. 
" but I found my Judgment wholly upon the Prophecies. 
I understand the King of France to be the first of die 
ten horns of the great Beast which were to fall of? and 
I believe that the nine others will fall off after him at no 
very distant period of time." " I am very glad to know 
your Reason, sir, and it is impossible for me to say that 
it is not sufficient : but it would be dangerous for puUic 
Men to hazard any great and decisive critical Measure 
upon such Information only** was my answer. The Doctor after a Htde pause added, with a smile " There is however I confess still some uncertainty attending it; for I 
was but yesterday reading The Travels of a French 
Gentleman in England in the year 1659. He had visited all parts of England, and said he found the Nation 
universally engaged in Deliberations upon the permanent form of Government they were to assume for the 
Preservation of Liberty for their Posterity. Various 
Parties were for different forms of a Republick, but all 
Parties unanimously agreed in this that there should 
never be Kings, Nobles or Bishops any more in England. Monarchy, Nobility and Prelacy were to be abolished forever. This was in 1659 when the Nation was 
so unanimous against Monarchy yet in 1660 the whole 
Nation went mad for Monarchy, Nobility and Prelacy 
again." Thus the Dr. I thought as he did that this example had great weight. I was not unacquainted with 
the passage in the French Traveller, tho I have forgot 
his name ; and the rise, progress and Termination of 
the civil war in England was very familiar to me. I 
read very early in Life Clarendon and Whitelock and 
all the principal writers upon that Period, and I know 
of no Book of mere History that was ever of more 
service to me than Clarendon or gave me so much in
sight into Men and Government, though I knew him to 
be partial. If our youth would read Clarendon more 
tho they should be obliged to read Johnson, Hume and 
Gibbon less there would be no loss. 

Whether the Prophesies, my Friend, are divine, as 
you and I believe them to be, or whether they are mere 
human Inventions of learned and ingenious Men as 
Voltaire his Masters and Disciples represent them to 
be they profess to comprehend a vast dispensation of 
<a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> beginning with the Creation and ending 
with the Conflagration of the World. The Universal 
History of the whole Family of Mankind therefore 
comes within the limits of this incomprehensible system. 
Not only the Hebrews, the Christians and Mahometans, 
but all the other Nations of the earth for all these have 
been more or less connected with the others, may be 
traced with a view to illustrate some passage or other 
in these ancient Predictions. A subject so sublime 
never fails to engage the attention, and often wholly 
engrosses it, of every Man of Learning and Genius 
who indulges himself in turning his Thought that way. 
It always excites enthusiasm and often transporting 
visions, and not infrequently Delirium. I do not think 
it an unlawful study, but I believe it to be a very dangerous one to any Man who is not well fortified with 
Philosophical as well as Theological Caution. To me 
it appears Presumption, I had almost said Impiety to 
pretend to foresee future events through this Telescope. 

Having named Voltaire I may now explain my long 
silence. For three or four months I have been in company with such great Personages as Moses, Zoroaster, 
Sanchoniathan, Confucius, Numa, Mahomet and others 
of that Rank. In that period I have read four volumes 
of Vcdtaires Essai sur les Moeuis et Te^Mit des Nations and three of his Louis 14 and fifteen, and these 
led me to read his Bible expliquee, his Philosophy of 
History, his Sermons, Homilies, Dialogues and a multitude of other Pieces in whidi his whole stock of 
Learning, wit, humour, satyr, scurrility. Buffoonery 
were exhausted. Many of these I had seen before. 
Indeed all his Materials have been ^uniliar to me for 
more than fifty years. Morgans Moral Philosopher 
and some others of the same stamp fdl into my hands 
at Worcester in 1755 and before and after that I had 
been acquainted with Leiands View of the Deisdcal 
Writers. And aU my Life time some Deisdcal writer 
or other has fallen from time to time into my hands. 
Nothing new to me therefore has occurred from reading this Fatrass of Voltaire. Indeed I have been somewhat surprized to find that there is nothing new in him. 
He borrows ever&gt;' Thing from Herbert Blount, Tindal, 
Collins, Woolston, Shaftsbury, Bolinbroke, and the 
other English Infidels with a few additions from his 
Countryman Boulanger and two or three others. 

The vast extent and variety of Talents which this 
mortal possessed had given him a Reputation, through 
the world and his wit and style attracted readers of all 
Nations. Every Body read his works. His Dramatic 
Compositions, his Epick Poems, his Historical Works, 
his astonishing Multitude of fugitive Pieces, his favourite Doctrines of Liberty temporal and spiritual and his 
daring attacks upon the Pope, the Monastic orders, and 
the whole Hierarchy of the Romish Church occasioned 
him to be more universally read than any other author 
that ever lived. This reputation gave him power to 
propagate through the world the miserable spoils which 
he borrowed or stole from the English Infidels with an 
effrontery more unjustifiable and inexcusable than that of 
the Hebrews which he censures so bitterly, when they 
borrowed Gold and Silver and Jewells of the Egyptians. 

In opposition to him I have been consulting the Letters of the Jews of Portugal, Holland, Germany and 
Poland. 

Never was poor Culprit more genteely whipped at 
the whipping post They have convicted him of ignorance of every Thing he pretended to know and in 
multitude of Instances proved him to be guilty of the 
grossest Lies and Impostures as well as of inconsistencies and contradictions innumerable. 

Although I have been so highly entertained as to 
neglect my most precious Correspondent I would not 
advise him ever to spend his time so idly, at least unless 
he should ever have as much Leisure as I have, and 
that I am very sure can never happen. 

I have no Amanuensis and if I had I would not copy 

this Letter and therefore I pray you to burn it

Dear Sir, What signify Clamours against Commerce, Property, Kings, Nobles, Demagogues, Democracy, the Clergy, Religion ? For to each and all of 
these has the Depravity of Man been imputed by some Philosophers. Rousseau says the first Man who fenced 
a Cabbage yard ought to have been put to death. Diderot says the first Man who suggested the Idea of a God 
ought to have been treated as an ennemy of the human Race. Tom Quelqu'un of Clapham in England said 
He believed in no God, No <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, no future state, but he loved Life so well that if he could but be assured 
of immortal existence, he would consent to be pitched about in fire and Brimstone by the Devils with their forks to all eternity. Some of our Religionists say that 
before a Man can be fit to be saved he must be willing 
to be damned to all Eternity. It is a Pitj" that Men of 
Sense will give any attention to any of these Ravings 
which are fit only for Bedlam. Phylosophy, Morality, 
Religion, Reason, all concur in your Conclusion that 
" Man can be governed only by accomodating Laws 
to his Nature." 

Your Lancet is so much and so usefiiUy employed 
that it seems to be hard to request you to meddle with 
your Pen. I have sometimes scruples lest I am doing 
an Injurj" to some of your Patients or Pupils when I 
provoke you to read or write a Letter. But as I know 
your political Pen to be as salutiferous as your medical 
or Chirurgical Instruments, I will run the risque to ask 
you, why in this momentous Crisis you and other Hiilosophers in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> will not write sometimes to 
help us out of our Difficult)\ The embargo must be 
removed. It is Pensilvania and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> who still 
keep it on. If it is kept on till I&gt;oomsday it will not 
bend France or England. We are in a shocking Delusion not only in our opinion of the efficacy of the 
embargo, but in our unaccountable aversion to Naval 
Preparations. The one Thing needful is a Navy. The 
expense is held up as a Bugbear. Mr. Searle told me 
in Holland that the accounts of our whole Naval armaments and Preparations during the Revolutionary War 
had been made up. And the United States shares in 
the Prizes they had made amounted to thirteen millions 
of Dollars more than their whole Cost. These were 
paper dollars no doubt, but if they paid their way, besides the necessary military Munitions and Protection 
to our Shores and Commerce they procured and afforded this was a great Thing. 

Whatever Vices there are, Federalism and Republicanism will cover them all. An infamous Birth, a 
more infamous Life, and a contemptible death, will at 
any time be cannonized as a saint by the former, and 
Folly, Ignorance, Stupidity and Debauchery will be 
adored in their Life time by the latter. No Virtues, 
No Talents will make atonement with either, for 
Honor and Justice when maintained against the Party 
Will. 

We may flatter ourselves that a Numerous Legislature will be favourable to the People and Bulwarks to 
Liberty, but it will be found that in all Countries and 
under all forms of Government a very few Men rule 
the whole. In Company with Mr. Eden at a Diplomatic Dinner he took me aside and said " I am anxious 
about affairs between my Country and yours.'* So am 
I. " Two honest Men sitting down together might in 
two or three hours arrange every thing to mutual satisfaction." I am fully of that opinion, but this Nation by 
what I can observe does not think so. '^ This Nation ! 
This Nation thinks exacdy as two or three of us would 
have it think, at most four or five of us." 

The same I fear may be said of our complicated 
Government of seventeen sovereignties within one 
sovereignty. 

Our Parties would not be dangerous if it were not 
for foreign Influences. To deny that there has been a 
French Influence and an English Influence in this Country ever since the Peace is to deny that the son and 
Moon have shone upon the earth. They have played 
with our Parties and run the Game of Leap fix^ with 
them. Lxx&gt;k bguJc upon the History of Europe for the 
last thirty years. You wili see French Influence and 
English Influence constandy at work in Russia, Sweden, 
Denmark^ Prussia, Germany, Holland, Spain, Portugal, 
Sardinia, N^Ies and Turkey. When two Nations so 
powerful and rich as England and France have been 
for ages in the habit of negotiating and intriguing with 
aU Nations how can we eicpect to be out of r«uji of 
dieir Arts ? They have played die Game of Leap frog 
with all the Nations I have mentioned as well as with 
usw The Great Body of our Nadon is divided in afiection or by fear between the two. Very few Men are 
really tmpgurtial and they have no Influence because 
nodiing but Party has influence. There is a French 
I^uty and an Ei^riish Party in every Nation of Europe. 
Wlule the opposite Winds are struggling for the so* 
periority we shall be tossed upon the bcQows. When 
either gets the Mastery we shall be driven incertum 
quo £ata ferant. 

A Navy is the only object that can form an indepexxient American I^irty. France and Englaod are 
both sensible of this tho we are not. and accordingly 
both Powers sec their laces against a Navy in ibis 
Country and do all they can to ciscourage it. 

Our Legisiatore meets the day after tomo im w and 
we shaE have stormy weather. Federattsoi grows 
every day more and more tr\"^mphanc and Mr. Je^ 
foffsom and his successor more and onre oopopa^. Nothiog will check thss Career but a Repeal of 
the Embargo Laws. Noa Lz^MrtadiixL Laws. Noa ict* 
tercourse Laws, and beginning in earnest a Naval 

force. 

I am sincerely yours

My dear Sir, — When you informed me that Mr. Cooper in his life of Dr. Priestley had ascribed to that 
Philosopher, the first hint of the Perfectability of the 
human mind, I answered you that this was the Doctrine 
of the Ancient Stoicks. My Memory did not serve me 
with details and I referred to no authorities, not thinking it worth while to search Books upon such a subject. 
But within a day or two I have accidentally met with a 
passage in Seneca a Disciple of Zeno to this effect that 
the human mind is a portion of the divine spirit immersed in Body, the same in God and in Man, with this 
difference only that in God it is perfect, in us capable of 
perfection. In corpus humanum, pars divini spiritus 
mersa. Diis hominibusque communis. In illis consummata est ; in nobis consummabilis. It was a Maxim 
of that school, that the human soul is divine and all 
divine natures are the same. Divinorum una natura 
est. Similar Ideas are found among all the ancient 
Philosophers as Pythagoras, Plato and their followers. 
The Christian Fathers adoped some of them. St. 
Austin says, Nothing is superior to the human soul but 
God. Nihil est potentius, nihil est sublimus. Quicquid 
supra illam est, jam Creator est. 

All Sectaries and especially all Innovators in Religion 
and Government have recourse to the marvellous to 
inflame the Imaginations and to Flattery of the human heart, to engage the aflfections of their followers. And 
no sect of Religion or Politicks that ever existed in the 
world, ever carried these Jesuitical artifices to greater 
extravagance than the late Faction of Atheistical Philosophers in France. 

But I am weary of Contemplating the phantasdc 
Theories and mad Practices of Divines, Philosophers, 
Legislators, Politicians and Conquerors. 

Experimental is the only Knowledge. 

Our beloved Country is becoming as delirious as all 
others. If you have time to read the Paper you will 
see what our Towns and Legislatures are doing, and 
why should an embargo be continued to produce such 
Proceedings as I am afraid to write, till it becomes 
ridiculous. The Southern States and the Northern 
States appear to me to be all going wrong to the utmost danger of our Union as well as Independence. The 
Town of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> and the other Towns and States in 
which it has most influence, are glowing, and the Legislature imbibes too much of their heat. And the 
Southern States have inflamed them all by venturing on 
Measures which cannot be justified. Measures which I 
believe no People in Europe could bear. Fury instead 
of Reason, will soon determine what shall be done, if a 
Change does not take place in our Councils. 

I wrote you on the 23rd. of January, since which I 
have received none of your favours. I am as ever your 
Friend without Interruption for five and thirty years.

Rush, — If I could dream as much wit as you, I think ' 
I should wish to go to sleep for the rest of my Life, 
retaining however one of Swifts Flappers to awake me 
once in 24 hours to dinner, for you know without a 
dinner one can neither dream nor sleep. Your Dreams 
descend from Jove, according to Homer. 

Though I enjoy your sleeping wit and acknowledge 
your unequalled Ingenuity in your dreams, I can not 
agree to your Moral. I will not yet allow that the 
Cause of " Wisdom, Justice, order and stability in 
human Governments" is quite desperate. The old 
Maxim Nil desperandum de Republica is founded in 
eternal Truth and indispensable obligation. 

Jefferson expired and Madison came to Life, last 
night at twelve o'clock. Will you be so good as to take 
a Nap, and dream' for my Instruction and edification a 
Character of Jefferson and his Administration ? 

I pity poor Madison. He comes to the helm in such 
a storm as I have seen in the Gulph Stream, or rather 
such as I had to encounter in the Government in 1797. 
Mine was the worst however, because he has a great 
Majority of the officers and Men attached to him and I 
had all the officers and half the Crew always ready to 
throw me overboard. Our Candidate for Governor 
Mr. Gore has brought forward in our Legislature a 
proposition for war against France. I hope their Constituents are not for that Measure. But if a Majority 
of them is, I am not. I am not for a Division of the 
Union. Neither by the Potomack nor by the Hudson, 
nor by the Delaware. 

Mr. Lincoln our Republican Candidate is one of our

Senators and Judges. The Royal appointments in New 
England before the Revolution were as respectable as 
Mr. Jeffersons appointments have been. 

I wish that some of the Choice Spirits in each of those 
four States could form a Connection that might unite 
those four great States in one plan or system of domestic or foreign affairs. Without this our seventeen sovereignties in one sovereignty, our seventeen wheels 
within one wheel, our seventeen Imperia in one Imperio 
will not work well. 

If Mr. Sneider discards Duane and Lieb, McKean 
and Dallas and depends wholly on his Quadroons, I 
have a strong Curiosity to know who they are ? what 
their systems ? what their Principles ? Can they be the 
old Constitutional Party ? I should suppose that Dallas 
and Duane had all them in their Friendship. Mr. Binns, 
your active and intelligent Printer, I suppose is a Foreigner. Of what Country is he? Pensilvania must 
always it seems be governed by Foreigners. 

The Birth of Washington was celebrated in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> 
too. The Feasts and Funerals in Honour of Washington, Hamilton and Ames are mere hypocritical Pageantry to keep in Credit, Banks, Funding Systems 
and other Aristocratical Speculation. It is as corrupt 
a system as that by which saints were canonized and 
Cardinals Popes and whole hierarchical systems created. 
I allow Washington, Hamilton and Ames all their real 
Merit but many others much more important and deserving than either of them instead of being honoured, 
are studiously, and systematically driven into oblivion. 

Our New England Federal Papers have been celebrating the dear Love of Old England towards us and 
the horrible dangers that Napoleon will conquer England and then conquer America till they have frightened 
the People into their Party. As I believe none of these 
Tales, I cannot approve much of the Conduct that has 
been produced by them. I have Children and Grandchildren and little to leave them besides their Liberty. 
I am sometimes more anxious for this than my Philosophy approves. I wish you could allay my fears. 

With great regard 

always yours

My sensible and humorous Friend, — I agree with 
Sidney as quoted in your favour of the 13th. That Civil 
War is preferable to Slavery and I add that foreign war 
and civil war together at the same time are preferable 
to slavery. 

We hear very often declamations on the demoralizing 
tendency of war, but as much as I hate war, I cannot be of 
the opinion, that frequent wars are so corrupting to human Nature as long Peaces. In a Peace of an hundred 
years and sometimes of fifty, and I have some suspicions 
of twenty five a Nation looses its honor, Integrity and 
most of its other virtues. It sinks into universal avarice. Luxury, Volupty, Hypocrisy and Cowardice. War 
necessarily brings with it some virtues and great and 
heroic virtues too. Holland, Denmark and Italy ought 
to be warnings to us. Those Nations by long Peace 
were sunk below the Character of Man. What horrid 
Creatures we Men are, that we cannot be virtuous widh 
out murdering one another ? 

The Honours done to Mr. Pickering I suppose were 
upon a similar Principle to those formerly done to Mr. Gallatin. 

I was not displeased to see by Mr. Madisons nomination of my son that he was not totally renounced, abjured and abhorred by all Parties like his Father : but I 
have no inclination to see him banished into Siberia. I 
rejoice that he is not to go, though I thank not the 
Senate for preventing it. That vote was an Aristocratical usurpation. There has been a constant Inclinatioa 
in the Senate for twenty years to interfere with the 
President in appointments to foreign Embassies. In

I see our American Parties precisely in the same 
Ugfat vidi )-ou. 1 am determined to swallow American Garlick enough to defend me against French and English, Federal and Republican Onions, let their odor be 
as strong as it will. 

The most modern Reproach against me that has come 
to my Knowledge is that " Misinterpretations and Misrepresentations of my opinions have done great Injuries 
to "my Country." And what has not been misunder&gt; 
stood and misrepresented? The spirit of God could 
not or would not dictate words that could not be misunderstood or perverted. Misinterpretations of the 
Scriptures of the old and new Testaments have founded 
Mosques and Cathedrals, have made saints Cardinals 
and Popes, Tyrants and Despots without Number, and 
deluged three quarters of the Globe I mean all Christian and Mahometan Countries at times in blood. Must 
not a Man write or speak lest his words should be misunderstood ? 

I am weary, my Friend of that unceasing Insolence 
of which I have been the object for twenty years. I 
have opposed Nothing to it but stoical Patience, unlimited submission, passive obedience and Non Resistance. 
Mausauleums, Statues, Monuments will never be erected 
to me. I wish them not. Panegyrical Romances will 
never be written, nor flattering orations spoken to transmit me to Posterity in brilliant Colours. No nor in true 
Colours. All but the last I loath. Yet I will not die 
wholly unlamented. Cicero was libelled, slandered, insulted by all Parties : By Caesars Party, Catalines Crew, 
Clodius's Mirmidons, aye and by Pompey and the Senate 
too. He was persecuted and tormented by turns by all 
Parties and all Factions and that for his most virtuous 
and glorious actions. In his anguish at times and in the 
consciousness of his own Merit and Integrity he was 
driven to those assertions of his own actions which have 
been denominated vanity. Instead of reproaching them 
with vanity I think them the most infallible demonstration of his Innocence and Purity. He declares that all 
honors are indifferent to him because he knows that it 
is not in the Power of his Country to reward him in any 
proportion to his services. 

Pushed and injured and provoked as I am I blush not 
to imitate the Roman, and to say to these snarlers against 
me that if to avoid misrepresentations of my words I 
had omitted to speak and write they would never have 
been wealthy and powerful as they are. This Country 
would never have been independent. Three hundred 
Millions of acres of excellent Land which she now holds 
would have been cutt off from her Limits. The Cod 
and Whale Fisheries those inexhaustible sources of 
wealth and power would have been ravished from her, 
the Massachusetts Constitution, the United States Constitution, the Constitution of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, that of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> and every other Constitution in the United States 
which is fit for any but Brutes to live under, would never 
have been made. Our Armies could not have been fed 
or cloathed for a long time nor our Ambassadors 
Franklin and Jefferson supported but with my Money ; 
an American Navy would never have existed the Barberry Powers would have captivated and plundered, 
and without my Treaty in 1800 which I made by force 
against all the Arts and opposition of those who pretended to be my Friends we should have been now involved in a foolish War with France and a slavish alliance 
with Great Britain. All this in my Conscience I believe 
to be true. 

Let the Federalists then talk about Misinterpretations 
and Misrepresentations of my words or actions. None 
have done more of them than themselves. I appeal to 
foreign Nations. I appeal to my own Countrymen within 
a year after my death. And there let the appeal rest 
for the present. 

Adieu, fireside to fireside as usual.

Dear Rush, — Thank you for your favour of the isL 
I might have quoted Job as well as St Paul, as a Precedent : but as I mix Religion with Politicks as little as possible, I chose to confine myself to Cicero. You advise 
me to write my own Life. I have made several attempts but it is so dull an employment that I cannot 
endure it. I look so much like a small Boy in my own 
eyes that with all my vanity I cannot endure the sight 
of the Picture. I am glad you have resolved to do yourself Justice. I am determined to vindicate myself in 
some points while I live. Inclosed is a whimsical specimen. In future I shall not be so Goguenard. 

The Dialogue between Diodati and me is litteral 
Truth. That is it is a litteral Translation from the 
French in which Language the Conversation was held, 
and which I reduced to writing. You may ask what 
Reasons I had for foreseeing such Consequences. I 
will give you a few hints among a thousand. 

I. When I went home to my Family in May 1770, 
from the Town Meeting in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, which was the first 
I had ever attended, and where I had been chosen in 
my absence without any solicitation one of their Representatives, I said to my wife, I have accepted a seat in 
the House of Representatives and thereby have consented to my own Ruin, to your Ruin and the Ruin of 
our Children. I give you this warning that you may 
prepare your Mind for your Fate. She burst into a 
Flood of Tears, but instantly cried out in a transport of 
Magnanimity " Well I am willing in this Cause to run 
all risques with you and to be ruined with you if you 
are ruined." These were times my Friend in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> 
which tried Womens souls as well as Mens. 

2. I saw the awefuU prospect before me and my 
Country in all its horrors, and notwithstanding all my 
vanity, was conscious of a thousand defects in my own 
Character as well as health which made me despair of 
going through and weathering the storms in which I 
must be tossed. 

3. In the same year 1770 My Sense of Equity and 
Humanity impelled me against a torrent of Unpopularity and the Inclination of all my Friends to engage in 
Defence of Captain Preston and the soldiers. My successful exertions in that Cause, though the result was 
perfectly conformable to Law and Justice, brought upon 
me a Load of Indignation and unpopularity which I 
knew would never be forgotten nor entirely forgiven. 
The <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Newspapers to this day shew that my apprehensions were well founded. 

4. You can testify for me that in 1774 My Conduct 
in Congress drew upon me the Jealousy and Aversion 
not only of the Tories in Congress who were neither 
few nor feeble, but of the whole Body of Quakers and 
Proprietary Gentiemen in Pensilvania. I have seen and 
felt the Consequences of these Prejudices to this day. 

5. I call you to witness that I was the first Member 

of Congress who ventured to come out in public as I did in January 1776 in my Thoughts on Gk&gt;vemment in 
a Letter from a Gentleman to his Friend, tliat is Mr. Wythe, in favour of a Government in three Branches 
with an independent Judiciary. This Pamphlet you know 
was very unpopular. No Man appeared in Public to support it, but yourself. You attempted in the public Papers 
to give it some Countenance but without much success. 

Franklin leaned against it. Dr. Young, Mr. Timothy 
Matlock and Mr. James Cannon and I suppose Mr. George Bryant were alarmed and displeased at it. Mr. Thomas Paine was so highly offended with it, that he 
came to visit me at my Chamber at Mrs. Yards to remonstrate and even scold at me for it, which he did in 
very ungenteel terms. In return I only laughed at him 
and rallied him upon his grave arguments from the old 
Testament to prove that Monarchy was unlawful in the 
sight of God. " Do you seriously believe Paine," said I 
" in that pious Doctrine of yours ?" This put him in 
good humour and he laugh t out. " The old Testament !" 
said he, ** I don't believe in the old Testament. I have 
had thoughts of publishing my sentiments of it ; but 
upon deliberation I have concluded to put that off till the 
latter part of Life." Paines wrath was excited because 
my Plan of Government was essentially different from 
the silly Projects that he had published in his Common 
Sense. By this means I became suspected and unpopular with the Leading Demagogues and the whole 
Constitutional Party in Pensilvania. 

6. Upon my return from France in 1779 I found myself elected by my native Town of <a href='/results.php?city=braintree' rel='city'>Braintree</a>, a Member 
of the Convention for forming a Constitution for the 
State of Massachusetts. I attended that Convention 
of nearly four hundred Members. Here I found such 
a Chaos of absurd sentiments concerning Government, 
that I was obliged daily before that great assembly and 
afterwards in the Grand Committee, to propose Plans 
and advocate Doctrines which were extreamly unpopular with the greater Number. Mr. Cushing was 
avowedly for a single assembly like Pensilvania, Samuel 
Adams was of the same Mind, Mr. Hancock kept aloof 
in order to be Governor. In short I had at first no 
support but from the Essex Junto who had adopted my 
Ideas in the Letter to Mr. Wythe. They supported me 
timorously and at last would not go with me to so high 
a Mark as I aimed at which was a compleat Negative 
in the Governor upon all Laws. They made me however draw up the Constitution, and it was finally adopted 
with some Amendments, very much for the worse. The 
bold, decided and determined Part I took in this Assembly in favour of a good Government, acquired me 
the Reputation of a Man of High Principles and Strong 
Notions in Government scarcely compatible with Republicanism. A foundation was here laid of much 
Jealousy and unpopularity among the democratical 
People in this State. 

7. In Holland I had driven die English Party and the 
Statholders Party before me like Clouds before the 
Wind and had brought that Power to unite cordially 
with America, France and Spain against England. If 
I had not before alienated the whole English Nation 
from me, this would have been enough to produce an 
eternal Jealousy of me and I fully believed that whenever a free Intercourse should take place between 
Britain and America I might depend upon their perpetual ill will to me and that their influence would be 
used to destroy mine. 

8. In all my Negotiations in France and Holland in 
1778, 1779, 1780, 1 781, 1782, 1783 and 1784 I had so 
uniformly resisted all the Arts and Intrigues of the 
Count de Vergennes and Mr. De Sardne and all their 
satellites, and that with such perfect success that I well 
know, although they treated me with great external respect, yet in their hearts they had conceived an ineradicable Jealousy and aversion to me. I well knew therefore that French Influence in America would do all in 
its Power to trip me up. 

9. Dr. Franklins behaviour had been so excessively 
complaisant to the French Ministry and in my opinion 
had so endangered the essential Interest of our Country that I had been frequendy obliged to differ from him 
and sometimes to withstand him to his face, that I knew 
he had conceived an irreconcilable hatred of me, and that 
he had propagated and would continue to propagate Prejudices if nothing worse against me in America from one 
end of it to the other. Look into Benjamin Franklins 
Baches Aurora and Duanes Aurora for twenty years 
and see whether my expectations have not been verified. 

With all these Reflections fresh in my Mind you may 
judge whether my anticipations in the good humoured 
Conversation with Deodati were rash, peevish or ill 
grounded. In short I have every reason to acknowledge 
the protecting <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> of God from my Birth and especially through my public Life. I have gone through 
Life with much more safety and Felicity than I ever expected. With devout Gratitude I acknowledge the 
divine favour in many Instances and among others for 
giving me a friend in you who though you would never 
follow me as a Disciple have always been my Friend.

Dear Sir, — ^I rejoice to find that Pensilvania has 
returned to reason and Duty in the affair of the Miss 
Writtenhouses. Our Massachusetts Legislators have 
not gone so far as yours did : but they have gone too 
far. 

I rejoice too at the Honourable acquittal of your 
worthy Brother, but lament the allarming attack upon 
the choicest Institution of Liberty the Tryal by Jury. 
Without this there can be no legal Liberty. 

Present my Compliments to Major Buder and tell 
him that though in former times our political Horses 
could not draw kindly together in the same Car, I recollect many a social hour with pleasure. 

What is to be the Destiny of our Country. It is 
Sampson struggling against the Blandishments of Delilah 
and the Chains of the Philistines. I hope he will neither 
brake his own Neck nor pull down the House upon his 
Head. I cannot and you will not do any Thing to deliver him out of the Toils. 

I hear Clergymen preach in a style I do not like. 
" A corrupt Capitol" &amp;c. Congress is no more corrupt 
than our Town of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> or our Massachusetts Legislature. At least I have as much Charity for them.

Dear Sir, — Your Letters are not apt to lie a month 
unacknowledged. That of May 5th. is before me since 
which I have reed, an Aurora under your envellope. I 
thank you for both. Thanks too for your sons inaugural 
Dissertation. I wish him success in his studies Travels 
and Practice. May he become as eminent, as skilful, as 
humane, as virtuous and as successful as his father. I 
rejoice that your son Richard is becoming eminent in 
his Profession. May he become as renowned in Law 
and State as his father is and I hope his Brother will 
be in Medicine. 

It would divert you if I were to amuse myself with 
writing an answer to the Tory Ennemy you mention. 
That wretches father stepped into my Practice in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> 
when I was sent to Congress and by my Business made 
a fortune of two or three hundred thousand dollars. 
Left him a splendid fortune, a Palace in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, a superb 
Country seat and very large sums in Banks and Stocks. 
' A fortune accumulating now every day whereas I have 
not added a shilling to my Property these eight years. 
He is worth I suppose four times as much as I am. His 
uncle by my appointment made as Navy Agent in three 
or four years more than I am worth. If I was allowed 
two and an half Per Cent on a Million Sterling that I 
borrowed and passed thro my hands in Holland as he 
was for 4 or 500 thousand dollars he spent as Navy 
Agent it would amount to twice the sum I am worth. 
For this I was never allowed a farthing. Two others 
of his Connections I promoted. This is Essex Junto 
Gratitude. 

I suspect Mr. Duane will be weary before he fulfills 
his Promise of republishing all my Letters. I fear I 
shall be too voluminous for him. 

Frederick the Great sent word to the Emperor Joseph 
the Second before the War of Bavaria ** To remember 
that tho he mounted his Horse with Difficulty, it was 
with equal Difficulty that he dismounted when once he was on." 

I should be glad to know how the British subjects, 
the American Oligarchs and the Democratical Republicans judge of my Revelations. 

With usual Love Esteem and Respect to all 

<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">J. Adams</a>.

I wish I were in a situation to see the Aurora.

Dear Sir, — A thousand thanks to Richard for his Auroras and ten thousand to you for your Letter of the 14th. 

I am not subject to low spirits, but if I was one of your Letters would cure me at any time for a Month. 

Voltaires Brain I shall never get out of mine. It will make me laugh whenever I think of it. The Jews 
and Nonotte have pickled his Brain in a more durable Manner and kept it in a more perfect state of Preservation than his Niece. I cannot help respecting in 
some degree however the wretch and his Brains too. 
There is something so fine and so wonderful about him. 
Why may we not believe that he and Hamilton too 
were converted in Articulo Mortis and admitted into 
Celestial Mansions ? If so they will both be now thanking us for exposing the Turpitude of their Hearts and 
the Perversion of their Intellects in the state of their 
high health. 

If "the Diversions of Quincy" were as scientifick and as useful as " the Diversions of Perley" I should never be ashamed of them. But 

Pretty in amber to observe the Forms 
Of Flies and Wasps and Scrubs and Dirt and Worms ; 
The Things themselves are neither rich nor rare 
But wonder ! How the Devil they came there. 

I am in a fair way to be examined upon Interrogatories 

by all the Lawyers and Politicians. But I must not be 

diverted from my Course by Wandering Lights.

My dear Friend, — I thank you for your favour of 
July 26 and its enclosures. 

You have frequendy in a most friendly manner advised me to write my own Life. I shall never have 
Resolution or Time to accomplish such a Work ; but 
having been called before the Publick most undesignedly and unexpectedly, and excessively reproached 
with one of the wisest most virtuous most successful 
and most important actions of my Life, the Peace with 
France in 1800 I undertook an Apology for it You 
may see by the manner in which that is executed, how 
large a work it would require to vindicate all the actions 
of my Life. 

I am now upon the Peace of 1783. That I shall exhibit chiefly in Copies of Document and a few extracts 
from my own Letters. How it will be received I know 
not The Printers in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> talk of an edition of them 
in a Book. That is their affair. I have nothing to do 
with it 
I wish your Lady and Daughter a Joyful! Return to 
you. I rejoice in James's success and Richards Happiness. 

John's Misfortune I deplore. I sympathize with you, 
and with the keener sensibility as I have experienced 
the Feelings and Reflections of a Father in Circumstances perhaps still more desperate calamitous and 
afflicting. 

Parents must have their Tryals. I am now experiencing another. My oldest son sailed on Saturday the 
5th. of this Month for St. Petersbourg with his Family. 
The separation was like tearing me to Pieces. A more 
dutiful and affectionate son there cannot be. His society was always a cordial and a Consolation under all 
Circumstances. I maintain my serenity however. I 
can only pray for his safety and success. 

The objects of his Mission I know only by Conjecture. I have thought these thirty years that we ought 
to have a Minister at that Court 

As Hamilton was the Sovereign Pontiff" of Federalism 
all his Cardinals no doubt will endeavor to excite the 
whole Church to excommunicate and Anathematize me. 
Content It was time for a Protestant Separation. 
Their avarice and Ambition their servility to England 
and Menaces of the Union were misleading the Nation. 
Fundamental Errors in Doctrine and Practice drew me 
once more out of my obscurity ; and it will be sometime before they hear the last, if Life and health endure of

My dear old Friend, — If I were not as disinterested 
as a Patriot, I should answer every Line from you as 
soon as reed, in order to get another. Your favour of 
Aug. 14 is yet, to my Grief unacknowledged. 

Neither Colonel Duane nor any other Newspaper 
will follow me through the long Journey I have undertaken. I am not certain that the Patriot will have Patience and Perseverance enough. In short I shall be so 
tedious that I shall have neither Readers nor Printers. 
I dare say that as much as you love me you have not 
ready and it will be impossible you should read all that 
I have published, much less all that I shall publish. The 
Duties of your Profession will not allow you time ; nor 
can I say it is worth your while if you had more Leisure. 

I have very solemn notions of the sanctity of History. 
Every Historian ought to be able to take the Oath 
of Thuanus, Pro Veritate Historiarum mearum Deum 
ipsum obtestor. This was an oath taken to I know not 
how many volumes, forty or fifty perhaps. I should not 
dare to take such an oath to any History I could write. 
I pretend to nothing more than to furnish Memorials to 
serve Historians. It is their Business and Duty to 
detect my errors and appreciate every Thing according 
to its true value. Amid all my avocations I have found 
time to read Mr. Fox's Morsell of History ; and I can 
scarcely refrain from wishing that his whole Parliamentary Life had been employed in writing History. It is 
but a Morsell of one single year of James the Second; 
but it displays an Industry a decernment a reflection 
beyond Robertson Hume Gibbon and all the rest 
The style too is more pure and genuine English, notwithstanding the parentheses, than any of the pompous 
and elegant fine Gentlemen I have mentioned with 
Johnson added to the number. I doubt whether faithful History ever was or ever can be written. 300 years 
after the event it cannot be written without offending 
some powerful and popular Individual Family Party some 
Statesman, some General, some Prince, some Priest or 
some Philosopher. The World will go on always ignorant of itself, its past History and future destiny. If you 
were to write the History of our Revolution how different it would appear from the Histories we have ! 

The Anecdotes you mention I have no doubt are true. 
In Holland I wrote some observations on my Friend 
the Abby Raynal, in which an account is given of the 
sending back the ships and destroying the Tea very 
conformable to what you remember I said to you. If I 
had time I would sent it you. 

Mr. Cheethams project is of uncertain utility. The 
sooner Pain is forgotten perhaps the better. I fear he 
has done more harm than good. This is however 
speaking after the manner of Men, with submission to 
higher Powers. 

The News of your son John gives me great pleasure. 
I hope his gloom will wear off; when it has excited the 
Reflections and prompted the Resolutions which it ought. 

I had a Mind to deposit in some Print, my Negotiations under the Commissions for the Peace of 1783. 
But I must omit one half and the other half will weary 
the patience of all Readers. I should look back like 
Gifford on the Labours of these years, with scepticism, 
if my own hand writing did not rise before my eyes to 
silence all doubt.

Dear Doctor, — ^Thanks for yours of Aug. 25 and 
the Papers enclosed. They are very high and very 
warm. You pretend that you have outlived your 
Patriotism ; but you deceive yourself. Your feelings 
contradict your Assertions. You can never get rid 
of your Amor Patriae and attachment to your Natale 
solum. At your age and mine it would perhaps be 
better for our Tranquility if we could outlive all our 
public Feelings. Yet the very thought of this strikes 
us both with horror. 

Mr. Boudinot and Mrs. Bradford have given us the 
Pleasure of their Company for one day and I have 
returned their kind visit in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. I found them sociable, friendly and agreeable. The aged Gendeman 
though afflicted with the Gout and has been confined 
for some time with it, has lost none of his vivacity or 
his Memory or his understanding as I could perceive. 
You remind me of a story which I heard in my youth of 
a young Priest who said of Dr. Tillotson 

Nothing but his Table 
Makes him considerable. 

Pray how comes Parson Caldwell to be so very rich ? 
I suppose he was another Witherspoon or another 
McWhorter who thought a part of Christs Kingdom 
was of this World. My Friend, the Clergy have been 
in all ages and Countries as dangerous to Liberty as 
the Army. Yet I lo\je the Clergy and the Army. 
What can we do without them in this wicked world. 
But to dismiss all this, what shall we say of Public 
affairs ? The Hounds have all been in fault : wholly 
lost and bewildered. They could not yet Scent the 
Track of the Fox. They know not which way to pursue the Game. I expect the Master Huntsmen will 
soon point out the Path : one will cry War with France 
and the other War with England. But they cannot get 
a vote in Congress for either. 

I have no hope of any settlement with France or 
England at present. It is impossible. England asserts 
a Sovereignty at sea and France almost claims an absolute Dominion at Land. We ought not to agree to 
either. We never can agree to the Claims of England. 
What shall we do. 

I am not pleased with embargoes or Non Intercourses : our People will not bear them. 

The Unum Necessarium is a Navy : but such is tlie 
Division and the Folly of our Country, that no public 
Man will bear to think of Floating Castles. We shall 
be the Sport, Scorn and Ridicule of all Nations till we 
do think in earnest of covering the seas with our armed 
schooners and Brigantines. One year would produce 
at less expense than the Gun Boats a little Power that 
would secure us more consideration than an hundred 
Thousand disciplined veteran land Forces. 

I have not yet got out of my head Fox's litde History. Some one of our Poets said how sweet an Ovid 
was in Murray lost ? I say how noble a Livy or Davila 
was lost in Fox ? 

You know that all my Vagaries are locked up in 
your own Breast. There let them rest. I shall stand 
by the Government as well as I can, whether I approve 
their Measures or not, if they are not too bad to be 
borne. But this I know the most active energetic Portion of Mankind, as the Americans undoubtedly are 
cannot be long restrained by Embargoes and Non Intercourses. They will have the free use of their Limbs 
whether the Consequence is foreign War or civil War, 
or what you will. 

Burn these Rhapsodies and Crudities lest they one 
day rise up in Judgment against 

your Friend

Dear Friend, — I reed, in course yours of the 7th. 
Fox was a remarkable Character. I admire the Morsell of History. Pitt was another. He has left nothing 
but speeches taken down by stenographers. I cannot 
pronounce either of them wise statesmen : yet perhaps 
they were as wise as they could be in their Circumstances. Great Men they both were, most certainly. 
Pitt I think was more correct in his Knowledge of the 
English Constitution and of the subject of Government 
in General than either Fox or Burke. Both of these 
have uttered and published very absurd Notions of the 
Principles of Government. 

I have seen and read Gregoires Letter with great 
Pleasure. Have a Care! Deceive not thyself ! There 
is not an old Fryar in France not in Europe who looks 
on a blooming young virgin with sang froid. Your 
Naturam expellas furca is mere infallible Nature. I 
do and will insist upon it you are still a Patriot, and 
you never can cease to be so. 

Give my Compliments to your son Richards Lady 
and tell her I love her. I congratulate you most sincerely on the acquisition of such a Daughter in Law, 
and your son on the inestimable felicity of such a Companion for Life. 

If a Button Maker becomes a Button at last ; the 
Lord knows what I am to be : A Newspaper I fear. I 
had rather be anything else. You are infinitely better 
off, if you are to become Sydenhams and Rushes Works. 
Oh! what would I not give to be a Sydenham or a 
Rush in Preference to being a Newspaper Writer ! 

Your present employment is Patriotism and what is 
more and better Philanthropy : far superiour to mine, 
as I not only fear but believe. In my Line I fear it is 
impossible to do any good. I hope I shall do no harm. 
Adieu.

My dear Sir, — Bacon the great Bacon was fond of 
Paradoxes. What could the old Hunks mean by Great 
Men having neither Ancestors nor Posterity? Was 
not Isaac the son and Jacob the Grandson and Joseph 
the Great Grandson of Abraham? Was not Julius 
Caesar the Posterit&gt;' of Anchises and Eneas ? Was not 
King William the Posterity of the Great William, 
Prince of Orange and of the still greater Admiral 
Coligni? Was not William Pitt, a great soul surely, 
the son of Chatham ? And Richard the son of Benjamin I hope will be as great a Man as his Father. But 
my Muse sobrius esto. 

Be pleased to present my kind Thanks to Mr. Rush 
for the Present of his Pamphlet which I have read with 
great and sincere Pleasure. It is very well written ; 
and with a degree of Candour Moderation and Modesty 
which is very uncommon at his age and with his fire. 
His argument is every way unanswerable and if it has 
not a great effect in Pensilvania I am greatly mistaken 
in my Conjectures. The Arbitration Law is so completely absurd that Party and Faction powerful as they 
are cannot long support it Mrs. Adams has read it 
and with so much approbation that she has read it over 
again to her Children and Grand Children. She thinks 
it one of the best Pamphlets she ever read. 

Your State of Pensilvania does great Injury to the 
Union by her strange Conduct If she goes on as she 
has done, she will ultimately ruin the Cause of Republicanism and produce the Division of the Union. You 
claim for her the Merit of sending back the Tea Ships 
and she has had great Merit on several occasions. But 
her Conduct has been so anomalous her March so much 
by Fits and Starts, that the rest of the Union knows 
not the Motives or Principles that govern her, nor when 
it is safe to depend upon her. 

I am as ever yours

My dear Sir, — I received yesterday your new edition on Animal Life and Madam read it in the evening 
to me and all the Family, to the great delight and 
edification of us all. Whether it is all solid or not we 
cannot say : but there are Ideas enough thrown out to 
excite and employ the attention and investigation of all 
the Philosophers, Physicians and Surgeons. Accept 
of all our Thanks for this favour. 
Whether there are more instances in favour of Bacons 
observation or against it, I believe that almost all Great 
Men have Mothers at Least I read in a Journal de 
Paris many years ago a List of almost all the Great 
Men who had lived and been famous in France, with 
an account of their Births, and they were almost all the 
sons 6f Tradesmen, Bakers, Brewers, Masons, Carpenters, Clothiers, Shoemakers, Cabinet Makers and some 
of them from Labourers, Livery, Servants and the 
lowest and meanest occupations in society. I regret 
that I did not preserve and copy this Catalogue. It 
was a Proof irrefragable that there is some Truth in 
Bacons Apophthegm. I believe however that there is 
in all such instances something more of mind in the 
father or Mother than is common. Have you never 
observed that Weavers, Shoemakers and Taylors are 
the most thoughtful Trades, because they are the most 
sedentary ? Do they not at least produce the most inquisitive and talkative People? This is a Topick of 
inexhaustible speculation. But I believe there is as 
much in the Breed of Men as there is in that of Horses. 
I know you will upon reading this cry out Oh the Aristocrat! The Advocate for hereditary Nobility! For 
Monarchy ! and every political Evil ! But it is no such 
Thing. I am no advocate for any of these Things. As 
long as sense and virtue remain in a Nation in sufficient 
Quantities to enable them to choose their Legislatures 
and Magistrates, elective Governments are the best in 
the world. But when Nonsense and Vice get the ascendency, command the Majority and possess the whole 
Power of a Nation, the History of Mankind shews that 
sense and virtue have been compelled to unite with 
Nonsense and Vice in establishing hereditary Powers 
as the only security for Life Property and the miserable 
Liberty that remains. Let my Countrymen therefore 
have a Care how they confide in Callender, Paine, Burr 
or Hamilton for their political Guides. If they do not, 
Calamities, Devastations, Bloodshed and Carnage will 
convince them that there is no special <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> for 
them. They will go the way of all the earth. 

A Dream again ! I wish you would dream all day 
and all Night, for one of your Dreams puts me in spirits 
for a Month. I have no other objection to your Dream, 
but that it is not History. It may be Prophecy. There 
has never been the smallest Interruption of the Personal 
Friendship between me and Mr. Jefferson that I know 
of. You should remember that Jefferson was but a 
Boy to me. I was at least ten years older than him in 
age and more than twenty years older than him in Politicks. I am bold to say I was his Preceptor in Politicks 
and taught him every Thing that has been good and 
solid in his whole Political Conduct. I served with him 
on many Committees in Congress in which we established some of the most important Regulations of the 
Army &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. 

Jefferson and Franklin were united with me in a 
Commission to the King of France and fifteen other 
Commissions to treat with all the Powers of Europe 
and Africa. I resided with him in France above a year 
in 1784 and 1785 and met him every day at my House 
in Auteuil at Franklins House at Passy or at his House 
in Paris. In short we lived together in the most perfect Friendship and Harmony. 

I was sent to England in 1785. He came to me in 
England and I travelled over the Kingdom with him. 
He met me afterwards in Holland. I there instructed 
him in the situation of all my money Matters before I 

left Europe. I have a Bushel! of Letters from him. If 

I were disposed to be captious I might complain of his 

open Patronage of Callender, Paine, Brown and twenty 

others my most abandoned and unprincipled enemies. 

But I have seen Ambition and Party in so many Men 

of the best Character of all Parties that I must renounce 

almost all Mankind if I renounce any for such Causes. 

Fare them all well. Heaven is their Judge and mine. 

I am not conscious that I ever injured any of them in 

thought word or deed to promote my own Interest or 

Reputation or to lessen theirs. Let them one and all 

say the same if they can. 

I am &amp;c.,

My dear Sir, — I thank you for the pleasing account 
of your Family in your favour of the 5th. As I take a 
lively interest in their Prosperity and Felicity, your relation of it gave me great Pleasure. We have Letters 
from our Colony navigating the Baltic, dated at Christiansand. They had been so far as prosperous, healthy 
and happy as such Travellers could expect to be. 

Pope said of my Friend General Oglethorpe 

Some driven by strong Benevolence of soul 
Shall fly like Oglethorpe from Pole to Pole. 

But what was a Trip to Georgia in Comparison with 
the Journeys and Voyages that J. Q. Adams has performed ? I do not believe that Admiral Nelson ever 
ran greater Risques at sea. 
Tell Richard that I hope Mrs. Rush will soon present 
him with a son that will do him as much honour in proportion, as the first born of his Genius has already done 
him in the opinion of the world. W. S, S. our Guardian 
of the Athenaeum has obtained it and proclaimed it 
loudly every where the best Pamphlet that ever he 
read. Be sure you do not hint this to Mrs. Rush Sear. 
It would allarm her Delicacy. 

I really do not know whether I do not envy your 
City of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> for its Reputation for Science, Arts 
and Letters and especially its Medical Professor. I 
know not either whether I do not envy you your Genius 
and Imagination. Why have not I some Fancy ? some 
Invention? some Ingenuity ? some discursive Faculty? 
Why has all my Life been consumed in searching for 
Facts and Principles and Proofs and Reasons to support them? Your Dreams and Fables have more 
Genius in them than all my Life. Your Fable of Dorcas would make a good Chapter or a good Appendix 
to The Tale of a Tub. 

But my Friend there is something very serious in this 
Business. The Holy Ghost carries on the whole Christian system in this earth. Not a Baptism, not a Marriage 
not a Sacrament can be administered but by the Holy 
Ghost, who is transmitted from age to age by laying the 
hands of the Bishops on the heads of Candidates for 
the Ministry. In the same manner as the holy Ghost is 
transmitted from Monarch to Monarch by the holy oil 
in the vial at Rheims which was brought down from 
Heaven by a Dove and by that other Phyal which I have 
seen in the Tower of London. There is no Authority 
civil or religious : there can be no legitimate Government but what is administered by this Holy Ghost 
There can be no salvation without it. All, without it is 
Rebellion and Perdition, or in more orthodox words 
Damnation. Although this is all Artifice and Cunning 
in the secret original in the heart, yet they all believe it 
so sincerely that they^iwould lay down their Lives under 
the Ax or the fiery' Fagot for it. Alas the poor weak 
ignorant Dupe human Nature. There is so much King 
Craft, Priest Craft, Gentlemens Craft, Peoples Craft, 
Doctors Craft, Lawyers Craft, Merchants Craft, Tradesmens Craft, Labourers Craft and Devils Craft in the 
world, that it seems a desperate and impracticable Project to undeceive it. 

Do you wonder that Voltaire and Paine have made 
Proselytes ? Yet there was as much subdety, Craft and 
Hypocrisy in Voltaire and Paine and more too than in 
Ignatius Loyola. 

This Letter is so much in the tone of my Friend the 
Abby Raynal and the Grumblers of the last age, that 
I pray you to burn it. I cannot copy it. 

Your Prophecy my dear Friend has not become 
History as yet. I have no Resentment or Animosity 
against theGendeman and abhor the Idea of blackening 
his Character or transmitting him in odious Colours to 
Posterity. 

But I write with difficulty and am afraid of diffusing 
myself in too many Correspondences. If I should receive a Letter from him however I should not fail to 
acknowledge and answer it. 

The Auroras you sent me for which I thank you, are 
full of Momentous Matter. 

I am Dear Sir with every friendly sentiment yours

Learned, ingenious, benevolent, beneficent old Friend of 1774, — Thanks for "the Light and Truth" as I used to call the Aurora, which you send me. You 
may descend in a Calm : but I have lived fifty years in a storm and shall certainly die in one. 

I never asked my son any questions about the Motives, Designs or Objects of his Mission to Petersbourg. If I had been weak enough to ask, he would have been 
wise enough to be silent : for although a more dutiful or affectionate son is not in existence he knows his obligations to his Country and his Trust are superiour to all 
Parental requests or Injunctions. I know therefore no more of his errand than any other Man. If he is appointed to be a Sampson to tie the Foxes together by 
their Tails with a Torch or Firebrand between them I know nothing of it One thing I know. We ought to have had an Ambassador there these thirty years and 
we should have had if Congress had not been too complaisant to Vergennes. Mr. Dana was upon the Point of being received, and had a solemn promise of a 
Reception when he was recalled. Under all the Circumstances of those Times however I cannot very severely blame Congress for this Conduct tho I think 
it was an error. It is of great Importance to us at present to know more than we do of the views, Interests and Sentiments of all the Northern Powers. 
If we do not acquire more knowledge than we have of the present and probable future state of Europe, we shall be hood winked and bubbled by the French and English. 

Of Mr. Jackson, his Talents, Knowledge manners or Morals I know nothing but am not unwilling to think favourably of them all. His Conduct to our President 
and his Minister is not however a Letter of Recommendation of his Temper, Policy or Discretion. His Lady was an intimate acquaintance of my Daughter and 
consequently well known to both my sons at Berlin. Thomas speaks very handsomely of her Person and accomplishments. 

I have not seen but am impatient to see Mr. Cheethams Life of Mr. Paine. His political writings I am 
singular enough to believe have done more harm than 
his irreligious ones. He understood neither Government nor Religion. From a malignant heart he wrote 
virulent Declamations, which the enthusiastic Fury of 
the Times intimidated all Men even Mr. Burke from 
answering as he ought. His Deism as it appears to 
me has promoted rather than retarded the Cause of 
Revelation at least in America and indeed in Europe. 
His Bilingsgate stolen from Blounts oracles of Reason, 
from Bolinbroke, Voltaire, Berenger &amp;c. will never discredit Christianity : which will hold its Ground in some 
degree as long as human Nature shall have any Thing 
Moral or intellectual left in it. The Christian Religion 
as I understand it, is the Brightness of the Glory and 
the express Portrait of the Character of the eternal 
self existent independent benevolent all powerful and 
allmercifuU Creator, Preserver and Father of the Universe ; the first good first perfect and first fair. It will 
last as long as the World. Neither Savage nor civilized 
Man without a Revelation could ever have discovered 
or invented it. Ask me not then whether I am a Catholic or Protestant, Calvinist or Armenian ? As far as 
they are Christians, I wish to be a Fellow Disciple with 
them all. 

I am my Dear Rush your affectionate

Dear Sir, — Thanks for yours of the first and the 
two Packetts. Who are they who furnish the Aurora 
with such an infinite quantity and variety of Compositions ? There must be many hands of no small Capacity or Information. In one you sent me before, 
there was an Anecdote of a Plan of Washington to 
attack <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> which was communicated to General Howe by a Person in his Confidence. The Narrator 
affirms he was intimate with Washington and daily at 
his Quarters. I have a Curiosity to know who this old 
Man may be. I can think of no human Being, who can 
support the Pretension. 

Your Letter is so grave a Mixture of Religion and 
Politicks, that I wish I had eyes Fingers and Time to 
write you an answer to it of a mile long. 

You will "patiently submit to our Rulers, let them 
do what they will.*' Not so Tittle Top I. No factious 
opposition for me. No lying down of Government for 
me. But if our Government will substitute Virginia 
Fence for the Wooden Walls of Columbia as our Friend 
Jefferson did, I will not applaud. I will disapprove and 
modestly complain : and I cannot answer for myself 
that I shall not say in some unguarded Moment to a 
confidential Friend who may betray me, Midas ! Le 
Roy Midas a Les Oreilles d'Ane. 
You seem to have borrowed, my Friend, from Tom 
Paine a kind of hatred to Government and to take 
Pleasure in representing it in an odious and disgusting 
Light " Was not Government one of the Curses of 
Adams Fall" If I were disposed to be merry, I would 
ask you was not the Fall of Man owing to the want of 
Government in Paradise ? Had Adam possessed and 
exerted the proper Authority and Power of Government he would have tamed the shrew who betrayed 
him and us. Pardon this appearance of Levity on a 
subject which ought always to be treated with Reverence. 

Are not Doctors, Lawyers, Priests, Merchants, 
Armies, Navies, Commerce, Manufactures, Fisheries, 
Wheat, Rye, Barley, Buckwheat, Wine, Oyl, Cyder, 
Beer, Punch, Flip, Slings, Drams, Shirts, Sheets, Wool, 
and Silk all the Curses of the Fall of Man ? Yes every 
one of them ; as much as Government, Jails, Stocks 
and Whipping Posts. Why should we loose ourselves 
in Lucubrations about allegories or Mysteries which 
never can be explained or comprehended in this world : 
when all our Brains ought to be employed upon the 
present Means of extricating us out of our Difficulties ? 
It is altogether beyond the Grasp, and out of the sphere 
of. human understanding to comprehend what would 
have been the state of this Globe and what the Condition of the human Race if the state of Innocence had 
been continued. We shall only loose ourselves and 
fall into absurdities by Conjectures. 

Feb. 23. 1 8 10. The Christian Religion is to flame 
through the universe in universal Love, excepting the 
Devil and his angels, and their Imps and Dupes. What 
is to become of these ? Will they be annihilated ? or 
will they repent, reform and be forgiven ? or will they 
remain ? Some of them seem to deserve unlimited Punishment : but I dare not dogmatize on this subject 

I have not found in my Walks that Paine has made 
Infidelity general among the common People, They 
have seemed to me rather allarmed. They asked are 
these the Notions in which we are to bring up our 
Children ? This will never do. It will be fitting them 
for the Gallows. 

It is very true as you observe England and The 
Tories have become very demure since France and the 
Jacobins so impudendy insulted Religion. 

All my Theology is summed up in your sentence 
" They only who have done good shall come forth to 
the Resurrection unto Life." 

I have never regularly read the works of Dr. Hartley. My Fire side to yours send Greeting. 

<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">J. Adams</a>.

Our Electioneering Racers have started for the Prize. 
Such a whipping and spurring and Huzzaing! Oh 
what rare sport it will be ! Through thick and thin, 
through Mire and Dirt, through Bogs and Fens and 
Sloughs dashing and splashing and crying out, the 
Devil take the hindmost 

How long will it be possible that Honor, Truth or 
virtue should be respected among a People who are 
engaged in such a quick and perpetual succession of 
such profligate Collisions and Conflicts. 

Mr. Gerry vs Mr. Gore and Mr. Gray vs Mr. Cobb

My DEAR Sir, — ^What can I say to my Friend in return 
for his Letter of 26 April ? My Grief for the melancholly Fate of my Friend John is only equalled by my 
sympathy with his amiable Family. In the midst of 
Grief remember Mercy. Richard remains to you as 
well as another son and several Daughters who do 
honor to their Parents and their Country. 

Oh that John had imitated the example of his Father, 
and answered ^ I am not afraid to die but I fear God." 

Dr. Rush and his son have exhibited to Mankind two 
examples, which ought to discredit Duelling more than 
any I have ever heard or read. The one by pleading 
Principle against the barbarous Custom : and the other 
by the terrible Remorse and fatall Consequences of 
violating that Principle. I still pray and will hope that 
he will be recovered and restored and remonstrate to 
the end of his Life against a practice which is not only 
against the Laws of God and Man ; but is peculiarly detestible in this Country because I believe it to be totally 
incompatible with a really free Republican Government It is as despotic a Tyranny over the freedom of 
thinking, speaking and writing as the Bastile the Inquisition or the Police of the Bourbons or Napoleons. 

How can I turn my Thoughts from this sublime and 
pathetic subject in which Morality Religion Laws Liberty and Government are so deeply interested to that 
Gossamour that idles in the wanton summer air John 
Randolph ! The Character of him in the Aurora is well 
drawn and in some respects just ; but makes too much 
of him. You have expressed in two or three Lines the 
Truth the whole Truth and Nothing but the Truth. A 

Boy with a mischievous syringe in his hand full of dirty 
water. The only good or great Thing he ever did in 
his Life that I know of was his refusal of Wilkinson's 
Challenge. His example and that of Harper, whatever 
were their motives ought to be sett up for Imitation. 

This Letter will be full of sentiment sympathy and 
Feeling. The day before yesterday I went to Hingham 
to convoy to the Tomb my ancient my invariable and 
inestimable Friend Lincoln. Six Skelletons or walking 
shadows among whom I was one, were the Paul Holders. 
Mr. Millville and Lieut. Gereker Cob, Mr. Cranch and 
Dr. Tufts, one 84 the other 80, Judge Paine at 80 and 
John Adams at 74 were the Men. 

A cold unanimated and ignorant sketch of his Life 
and Character was pronounced by his own Parson in a 
funeral sermon. A long Train to be sure of Relations 
and Neighbours walked in Procession. No Arms ; No 
Militia, no Regulars ! A few, very few Gentlemen from 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. Governor Gore, to do him Justice, attended. 

Recollect the Mock Funerals of Washington Hamilton and Ames. Lincolns Education, his Reading his 
general Knowledge, his Talent at Composition was 
superiour to Washingtons : his services more arduous 
dangerous and difficult than Washingtons. 

How long will fraud prevail over Honesty? Hypocrisy over Sincerity in this sublunary Chaos ? 

But my Friend there is a subject that hangs with 
more weight upon my Mind than all these, at present 

South America is an object of immense Magnitude. 
Its Independence will for what I know produce greater 
Convulsions and Revolutions upon this Globe than that 
of North America. 

It is a Question which will now force itself upon the 
Consideration of our Nation. It is of vast Importance 
that we should form correct Ideas and obtain accurate 
Information on this subject. The human universe is 
asleep, but it must awake. How will the Independence 
of S. America affect the Destiny of the U. S. ? How 
will it affect all the Powers of Europe ? How will it 
affect the whole of Asia and Africa ? The whole Globe 
the whole human Race is interested, deeply interested 
in it. Let us be cool and sober if we can. It is a more 
difficult Question than our own Independence. 

I could write to you a volume upon this subject, if I had 
eyes and fingers. But I must soon follow my Friend 
Lincoln and leave to young Men, who seem to me to 
have no Ideas nor any desire to acquire any, but for 
getting Money and writing in a pretty style. Such at 
this moment is the peevish Temper of your old Friend 

<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">John Adams</a>.

Have you seen Bristeds broad Hints ? If you ever 
see or hear of The <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Patriot, you will see something in that of last Saturday and next Wednesday you 
will see something relative to him and South America. 
I should be glad to see the Aurora speculations upon it, 
if any, and to know the small Talk of the <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> 
Politicians. Does S. A. make any great Figure in Mr. Whartons system of Prophecies ?

Friend, — I acknowledge my fault in neglecting to 
answer two or three of your last favours. I now thank 
you for the Letters and the " Light and Truth" as I used 
to call the Aurora. 
What are we to think of all these adventurers ? Tom 
Paine, Cobbet, Duane, Carpenter, Walsh, Bristed ? wiA 
twenty &amp;cs. Are they all sent out here, by administrations or opposition, French or English, Scotch or Irish ? 

Our Country, my dear Friend, is an object of speculation in Europe among Politicians as much as the poor 
soldiers Certificates were among Hamiltons Patriots in 
America, 

Duane and Cobbet are in a &amp;ir way I think to cooperate in the same great Cause of Sir Francis Burdet, 
Col. Wardle, Democracy and Revolution. They seem 
to be greeting each other, as Callender and Colman did, 
after the former had declared war against Jefferson. 

Is our Country, my Friend, to be the Puppet danced 
on the Wires of such Men ? Has America no soul ? 
Is there no Genius in it ? Is there no Feeling ? Is there 
none to mount the Breach ? 

All that you and I could do would be to fall upon our 
swords like Cato : but that would do no good. 

Time was, when Men were not wanting to expose 
themselves to danger. Young Men, who had Forces 
of Mind and Body. 

In your last Letter, June 20, you do not say whether 
Napoleone or Nerone Neronior as we sometimes called 
our Great Hammer 30 or 40 years ago, is now meant 
by Jeremiahs Hammer of the whole earth. Britain is 
the Hammer of Asia Africa and America as well as 
Europe. France is a Hammer to Europe only and to 
America when she sends her sons and Ships to Europe. 

Come out of the Clouds, Doctor and let me see your 
Face and shape. I know you will not : and I do not, I 
cannot blame you. 

The two Hammers maul the world, the sea as well as 
the Land. Our United States are mauled by both. I 

am no Pn&gt;|^t But I believe that Jeremiah if he could 

be consulted, would say that both those Hammers 

whether of Brass or Iron or Steel or Adamant must 

sooner or later be cut asunder and broken bv America. 

Empire marches Westward and will carry its Arms 

with it, for without them it cannot exist in spight of all 

the Pacific Philosophy of your Friend Jefferson and 

yourself. 

Now, I know you will not say one word to me, in 

answer to thb Rapsody. I shall continue ignorant of 

your sentiments. But I shall not love you the less. 

Continue to love me, let me know the progressive 

Happiness and good Fortune of your Ciiildren. send 

me now and then a Dream, or a Fable or an Epigram 

with a good Point and a pure Moral, and you will be 

sure of the Gratitude of vour old Friend

Dear Sir, — I have been entertained and diverted 
with the Humour and the Wit of my old Friend 
O Brian as you call him. The JackAss and the Cow are 
most excellent animals in their own way and their own 
sphere. Xone more usefuU. But neither is verj- well 
qualified for Legislators or Politicians: or to pursue 
the figure and hunt down the allegorj' Neither would 
make a Figure at the New Markett Races or in drawing his Britannic Majesty's Coach of State, or even 
along side The Lord Mayors Horse. 

And these curious Figures bring to Mind The Lectures for which you thank me. I have no Pretensions to your Gratitude or Politeness on this occasion. The 
Books were sent you by Thomas Boylston Adams in complyance with positive orders from his Brother 
John Quincy Adams in writing, before his Departure for St Petersbourg. I am very angry with Thomas for 
not writing you a formal and ceremonious Letter when he sent the Books explaining all these important Circumstances. 

I have not seen the Port Folio for several years. 
Who is the Editor of it now ? Is Mr. Dennie still the 
Editor ? Do you know that Man ? There is not in 
England a more zealous Englishman : and as J. Q. A has 
now every Englishman in the Universe for his Enemy, 
it is not wonderful that an Englishman should slurr the 
Productions of an American. The Scotch and English 
are now united. They all agree that if all Dr. Rush's 
works were annihilated, human knowledge would receive no Diminution. 

When we recollect that those Lectures were the work 
of but about two years, and the greatest part of those 
years spent in the Senate at Washington, and when he 
was at home encumbered with the Cares of a Family, 
and the Management of a considerable share of Business at the Bar and his private Property : When we 
recollect that Blairs Lectures were the Work of four 
and Twenty years and Professor Wards of sixteen 
years, our American Homespun will not appear a contemptible Manufacture. I would hazard my Life that 
Longinus Quintilian and Cicero in Counsel would pronounce it vastly superiour to Blair Ward or any other 
work upon oratory English or Scotch. 

Originality is not to be expected from a Teacher of 
Oratory in this age of the World. Yet I am confident 
there is more originality in these Lectures than in all 

the other writings upon oratory now existing in English 

Scotch or Irish. 

I have an urgent Curiosity to know who is Mr. Walsh 

of <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> ? is he a Scot, or the Son of a Scot ? I 

know he is a Pupill of the Edinborough Reviewers: 

and that he is employed to teach Doctrines which they 

profess too much Candour and Impartiality to avow. 

Who is also Mr. Bristed who has published such broad 

Hints? 

I am as ever yours 

<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">John Adams</a>.

Dear Sir, — I am much obliged by your favour of 
the 8th. Oh how I wish I had time to write and you 
Patience to read The Anecdote I could dictate concerning '*Chapmans" in New England. All **able bodied 
Men." 

I deceived you a little by an Inference of my own from 
what the Edinborough Reviewers had written. I know 
not that they have mentioned you by Name or your 
Works by their Titles : but I read in them ** If every 
Thing which has ever been written in America [if you 
except perhaps the Works of Franklin] were annihilated 
the sum total of human knowledge would in no degree 
be lessened," I drew the Inference, for Dr. Rush's 
Works have been written and printed in America. 

I have felt as well as you The Odium Theologium, the Odium Politicum, and The Odium Mercatorium. 
Happily I have escaped as far as I know The Odium 
Philologium, The Odium Medicum and The Odium 
Sangniphobium. I have escaped these Hatreds because 
I never knew enough about any of them to excite any 
other Mans Jealousy or Envy. 

But now I must tell you a great and grave Truth. 1 
am one among your most serious haters of the Philological Species. I do most cordially hate you for writing 
against Latin Greek and Hebrew. I never will forgive 
you untill you repent, retract and reform. No Never! 
It is impossible. 

I thank you for the Sketch of Mr. Walsh. His Pamphlet is but a Second Edition of the Cabinet of H. Cleod, 
a little disguised. It is all a Phantastical Delusion. 
The Religion of his Father and The Praeceptors of his 
Education are enough to convince us with whom he 
conversed in France. And his Residence in Scodand 
and Connection with The Edinborough Reviewers sufficiently explain his Information on British Affairs. 

There is one Gentleman whose Name is Richard Rush 
quite capable of answering Mr. Walsh. But I do not 
think it worth while. There is a French Pamphlet by 
my old Friend Sir Francis D'lvernois " Effets Du Blocus 
Continental sur le Credit, et La Prosperity Des Isles 
Britanniques leur Commerce et Finances" of much more 
Importance. He proves to a Demonstration as he thinks 
that our Embargo and Bonapartes Continental System 
have greatly assisted and increased the Commerce 
Credit Wealth Manufactures Agriculture and Power of 
Great Britain ! ! ! 

Votre Blocus ne bloque point 
Et grace a votre heureuse adresse 
Ceux que vous affaraez sans cesse 
Ne i^eriront que D' Embonpoint. 
All the Political Pamphlets I see, of modern date, are 
Paradoxes. Some whimsical Maxim or other, like Jean 
Jaques Philippic against Arts and Sciences, is the Theme 
of every one. I see nothing like a sober investigation 
of the Truth. 

•* My Family Name" ! Why my Family Name, to my 
Knowledge is scattered all over Europe and America : 
in Spain, France, England, Scotland, Ireland, Germany, 
Italy : there are Millions of them. What are they to 
me? No more than all the Posterity of Adam our 
common ancestor. The Whistling of a Name does as 
much hurt as good as the Rushes as well as The Adamses 
and Hancocks will find. We shall be damn'd like Cromwell if a conspiracy of Nations especially English and 
French with The Tories can effect it, to everlasting 
Purgatory. 

I wish Richard would read Bristed. Let him see 
what emmisaries are sent here, and for what purpose. 
Let him inquire too into his Bristeds Connections in 
America. I do not ask you to read him. I know you 
cannot. Your Professional Duties forbid it. 

Your Volume of Lectures will be very acceptable 
here, not only to your Friend Mrs. Adams but to the 
Physicians and Philosophers here. For "The Family 
Name of Rush" is respected here more than it is in 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 

Rush ! Every persecuted Man, persecuted because 
he is envied, must be an Egotist or an Hypocrite. You 
and I must therefore cordially embrace the Character of 
Egotists and acknowledge the Imputation of Vanity, or 
be totally overborne or become lying Hypocrites, which 
you will swear you will not. So will I. 

Pardon me for concluding this Rhodomontade by a 
very serious Paragraph. Yesterday were committed to 
the Tomb the Remains of William Gushing a Judge of 
the National Supreme Court. Fifty nine years, has he 
been known to me and esteemed and beloved as an 
invariable Friend. A Judge for Forty years of unblemished Character. My Contemporaries are almost 
all gone and left me almost alone. I wait in silence 
and Resignation for my Turn. Untill it arrives I shall 
cherish Rush at least, as another invariable 

Friend to 

<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">John Adams</a>.


P.S. — I have read the Criticisms in The Port Folio on 
The Lectures and been much disappointed. They are 
almost entirely litteral grammatical and Typographical 
and in general just and remark faults that ought to be 
corrected. 

His Discussion of The Question about '* Purity*' I 
have not considered attentively enough to form an 
opinion. His observation that the Plan is not original but the same with that of Quintilian is not as I believe exactly just, but if it were I should think it no 
fault nor Imperfection. The Writer is sparing of Praise. 
He is probably no Friend to The Professors Politicks, too much of an Englishman perhaps. But there 
is another Cause. <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> are 
as frugal of Praise to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> as Britons are to Americans. It is an instinctive antipathy. If you are well 
informed and really candid and impartial you must 
acknowledge that there is a dirty and ignorant Jealousy 
and Envy of New England in Pensilvania and New 
York, which must soon be eradicated or the Union will 
soon feel Calamities which will remove those Prejudices 
when it may be too late, or rivet them into National 
Hostilit}-.

Dear Sir, — Mrs. Adams says she is willing you 
should discredit Greek and Latin, because it will 
destroy the foundation of all the Pretensions of the 
Gendemen to superiorit\' over the Ladies, and restore 
Libert}-, Equalit\- and Fratemit\- between the sexes. 
What does Mrs. Rush think of this ? 

Hobbes calumniated the Classicks because thev filled 
young Mens heads with Ideas of Liberty, and excited 
them to rebellion against Le\nathan. 

Suppose we should agree to study the oriental Languages especially the Arabic, instead of Greek and 
Latin. This would not please the Ladies so well, but 
it would gratify Hobbes much better. According to 
many present appearances in the world many useful 
Lessons and deep Maxims might be learned from the 
Asiatic writers. There are great Models of Heroes 
and Conquerors fit for the Imitation of the Emperors 
of Britain and France. For example in the Life of 
Timur Bee, or Tamerlane the Great we read vol. i. p. 
202 *'It was Timurs ambition of universal empire 
which caused him to undertake such glorious actions. 
He has been often heard to sav, that it was neither 
agreable nor decent that the habitable world should 
be governed by two Kings : according to the words of 
the Poet, as there is but one God, there ought to be but 
one King, all the earth being ver\' small in comparison 
of the Ambition of a great Prince." Where can you 
find in any Greek or Roman writer a sentiment so sublime and edifying for George and Napoleon. There 
are some faint Traces of it in the Conduct of Alexander 
and Caesar but far less frank and noble, and these have 
been imprudently branded with Infamy by Greek and 
Roman orators and Historians. There is an abundance more of such profound Instruction in the Life of 
this Tamerlane as well as in that of Gengizcan, both of 
which I believe Napoleon has closely studied. With 
Homer in one Pocket, Caesars Commentaries in the 
other, Quintus Curtius under his Pillow, and the Lives 
of Mahomet, Gengizcan and Tamerlane in his Port 
Folio, and Polybius Folard, Montecucculi, Charlemagne, 
Charles Twelfth, Charles 5th. cum multis aliis among his 
Baggage this Man has formed himself: but the Classics 
among them have damped his ardor and prevented his 
rising as yet to the lofty Heights of the Asiatic Emperors. Would it not be better that George and Napoleon should forget all their Classicks and mount at 
once to all sublimities of Mahomet, Gengizcan and 
Tamerlane ? In that case one or the other must soon 
succumb : and would it not be better that one such 
should govern the Globe than two ? 

Oct. 15. Thus far I had written when your favour 
of the 8th. with your Invention a Tranquillizer was given 
to me from the Post Office. The Tranquillizer is a very 
ingenious Mechanical Invention and I hope will be beneficial to that most deplorable portion of our species for 
whom it is intended. But to be serious, if I were possessed of sovereign Power over your Hospital, [provided I could do it secretly so that no Mortal should 
know it, but you and I] I would put you into your own 
Tranquillizer, till I cured you of your Fanaticism against 
Greek and Latin. 

The Greek Testament cannot be read to effectual 
advantage, without a comprehensive knowledge and 
critical skill, in all the Grecian Litterature. 

The World had never seen a Mihon if a Homer and 
Virgil had not lived before him : nor any one of the 
Poets orators or Historians you mention among the 
English, Scotch or Irish or French if Greece and Rome 
had not furnished them Models. 

My Friend you will labour in vain. As the Love of Science and Taste for the Fine Arts increases in the 
World, the admiration of Greek and Roman Science 
and Litterature will increase. Both are increasing very 
fast. Your Labours will be as useless as those of Tom 
Paine against the Bible, which are already fallen dead 
and almost forgotten. 

Our Financial System and our Banks are a species 
of fraudulent oppression upon the Community. But 
you would think me mad enough for your Tranquillizing Chair if I should say there is no Remedy but to 
return to a circulating Medium of Gold and Silver 
only. 

Commerce has in all times made wild work with elections, but it never invented so artful a scheme of Corruption for that purpose as our American Banks. 

I am almost as gloomy as Ames. At times I see 
nothing to prevent our Country both North and South 
America from becoming in another Century if not in 
this, a Theatre for Gengizcans, Mahomets, Tamerlanes, 
Charlemagnes, Napoleons, Burrs and Hamiltons. Our 
People are the shrewdest and most sagacious that I 
know, but yet they are so easily deceived, and are in fact 

SO universally deceived in many essential Points, that 
they afford no certain Resource for honest and able 
Men : and for what I see they will not open their eyes 
till they themselves will be obliged to have recourse to 
the Ratio Ultima Populorum, Rerum Publicarum et 
Regum. We know how this always ends. 

Of the Strictures on Ames's Works we have not a 
Copy in the World. The Printer sent us two or three 
at the Time : but Mrs. Adams has given them all away 
to one friend or another who wished to have them. I 
will endeavor to procure one for your son : but am not 
certain that it is to be had. 

I am as ever

Dear Sir, — It was but yesterday that I was able to 
obtain the enclosed Review of Works of Mr. Ames, 
which you or rather your son wished to see. 

You and I are so much better employed that I presume Political Pamphlets are beneath your Notice as 
well as mine. You are employed in healing the sick 
and extending the Empire of Science and Humanity. 
I, in reading Romances in which I take incredible Delight. I have read within a few weeks : let me see : in 
the first Place Oberon in two Translations, one by John Quincy Adams and the other by Sotheby two refined 
Translators, though neither has as yet acquired a reputation as an original Poet. This Romantic, Heroic 
Poem of Wieland is all enchantment in every sense of 
the word. In the next Place. The Scottish Chiefs, 
which is superiour to Oberon, and beyond all Comparison the noblest Romance in the world. It is better tho 
not so classical as Don Quixotte or Telemachus or Sir 
Charles Grandison. In the third Place The Lady of the 
Lake. In the fourth place The Lay of the last Minstrel. 
In the fifth Place, I intend to read Marmion as soon as 
I can get it. In the sixth Place, The Edinburg Reviews, 
as entertaining Romances to me as any of the former. 
These Fellows pretend to all knowledge and they have 
a great deal. But they resemble their Creolian Countryman Alex Hamilton. They can hammer out a 
Guinea into an Acre of Leaf Gold. 

I read with Pleasure, in their Review of the fourth 
Report of the Directors of The African Institution, Vol. 
16. p. 434 an honourable Tribute of Respect to Dr. 
Rush President of the Abolition Society &amp;c. 

Have the Scotts monopolized all the Genius of the 
three Kingdoms? All the Litterature comes from 
them at present. I neither read nor hear of any Englishman of any fame. 

These Scottish and German Romances show in a 
clear light the Horrors of the Feudal Aristocracy as 
the Histories of Gengizcan and Tamerlane shew the 
same Anarchy in the Asiatic Aristocracy. In Europe 
and in Asia they all ended in Despotism or in Simple 
Monarchy. 

And how will our Aristocracy proceed and end? 
Will our State Governors become Abthanes? Virgina, Pensilvania and Massachusetts have given broad 
Hints. 

Every Government is an Aristocracy in Fact. The 
Despotism of Gengizcan was an Aristocracy. The 
Government of the most popular French Convention 
or National Assembly was an Aristocracy. The most 
democratical Canton in Switzerland was an Aristocracy. 
The most levelling Town Meeting in New England is 
an Aristocracy. The Empire of Napoleon is an Aristocracy. The Government of G. Britain Is an Aristocracy. But as they The Aristocrats are always ambitious 
and avaricious The Rivalries among them, split them 
into Factions and tear the People to Pieces. The great 
secret of Liberty is to find means to limit their Power 
and control their Passions. Rome and Britain have 
done it best. Perhaps we shall do better than either. 
God knows. 

The pretty little warbling Canary Bird Fisher Ames 
sang of the Dangers of- American Liberty. I had 
preached in **The Defence'' and the "Discourses of 
Davila'' and held up in a Thousand Mirrors all those 
Dangers and more twenty years before him. Ames 
had got my Ideas and examples by heart. There was 
not a Man in the world who read my Books with more 
ardour, or expressed so often an admiration of them. 

But Ames's Misfortune was that the sordid Avarice 
which he imputes to the whole Body of the American 
People belongs chiefly if not exclusively to his own 
Friends The Aristocrats or rather The Oligarchs who 
now rule the Federal Party. 

But I forbear and spare your Patience. 
I am as ever, and I think more 

and more your Friend

Dear Sir, — I sent my wife to the Post Office this 
morning with a Letter to you enclosinfj a Review of 
Fisher Ames and as she brought me back yours of the 
21 you will receive this by the same mail. 

I am well and my good Madam is well at the present 
Hour but she is a Weather Glass. 

I am afraid your prejudices are too fixed to be removed by any arguments : but I do not find that you 
make many Proselytes. In Europe the Classicks are 
more studied than they have been for an hundred years. 
Sothebys Translation into English and iJeLisles into 
French of the Georgicks, and innumerable Translations 
-yi other Greek and Roman OriiUjn&gt; Poets and Ilibtorians as well as Philosophers have brought them into

as not to be hurt, for he is a most useful! and necessary 
animal in his Place. Nothing can be done without him. 

It is to no purpose to declaim against the Crimes of 
Kings. The Crimes of Aristocrats are more numerous 
and more atrocious. And are almost universally at 
least generally the Cause of the Crimes of Kings. Bind 
Aristocracy then with a double Cord. Shut him up in 
a Cage. From which however he may be let out to do 
good but never to do Mischief. 

The Banking Infatuation pervades all America. Our 
whole system of Banks is a violation of every honest 
Principle of Banks. There is no honest Bank but a 
Bank of Deposit. A Bank that issues Paper at Interest 
is a Pickpocket or a Robber. But the Delusion wll 
have its Course. You may as well reason with a Hurricane. An Aristocracy is growing out of them, that will 
be as fatal as The Feudal Barons, if unchecked in Time. 

The Banks were anteriour to Funding System, and 
therefore I cannot attribute all our evils to that Paper 
Money was better than this Bank Money, because the 
Public reaped the benefit of the Depreciation : but the 
Depreciation of Bank Money accrues wholly to the 
Profit of Individuals. There is no honest Money but 
Silver and Gold. 

Think of the Number, the Offices, Stations, Wealth. 
Piet)^ and Reputations of the Persons in all the States, 
who have made Fortunes by these Banks, and then you 
will see how deeply rooted the evil is. The Number 
of Debtors who hope to pay their debts by this Paper 
united with the Creditors who build Pallaces in our 
Cities and Castles for Country Seats, by issuing this 
Paper form too impregnable a Phalanx to be attacked 
by any Thing less disciplined than Roman Legions, 
If you or I were to attempt Uy prca/;h a^;ifn&lt;^t thift

Dear Sir, — Your favour of the 10th, is just come from the Post Office. I thank you for reading the 
Pamphlet, which considering the more interesting Studies and Labours of your Profession, I consider as a 
favour. With your Letter I received a Packet of Letters from my son and Daughter at Petersbourg, dates as late as 25 October. I wish I could print these Letters, but I dare not 

A Fathers Partiality will no doubt concur with you 
and your son, in your favourable opinions of The 
Review of Ames. The English, The Scotch and the 
Irish may boast of themselves as they will, and despise 
America as much as they can : but I know of no Productions of Robertson, Hume, Gibbon or Johnson, 
which exhibit a more entire Mastery of The English 
Tongue, and all its Graces, ornaments and elegance, 
than this little Pamphlet and several other Productions 
of the same Pen. 

Ames was ingenious, had read a good deal, and was 
a fair Character and a good Man : but he owed his 
Rise, and was buoyed up by a British Faction and the 
Remnants and Shreds of old Toryism, as an ^gg is 
borne upon the surface of a strong Lie. It was not in 
him, nor in the Citizens who removed to Nova Scotia, 
Canada and England in 1 776, a monarchical Mania but a 
Mania of fear and ambition : Fear that we should be 
conquered and beheaded ; and ambition to obtain wealth 
and Power by the favour of Great Britain. 

I have received with great pleasure your sons opinion ; and in a style equal to the subject of his Panegyrick. I hope I shall receive more of his favours. 
What shall I say to you on the subject of Corruption ? 
Elections engender it as naturally and I fear as unavoidably as excessive Heat in Summer sours bread or taints 
meat You may trace it in a thousand Instances and in 
various ways already : besides Dr. Donne's in his fourth 
Satyr as versified by Pope. 

Who in the secret deals in stocks secure 

And cheats th' unknowing Widow and the poor : 

Who makes the Trust of Charity a job, 

And gets an Act of Parliament to rob : 

Why turnpikes rise, and now no Cit or Clown 

Can gratis see the Country or the Town. 

Shortly no lad shall chuck or Lady vole, 

But some excising Courtier will have Toll. 

He tells what Strumpet places sells for Life 

What Squire his Lands, what Citizen his Wife. 

I will give you an Anecdote to answer yours of the 
Bribe offered to General Muhlenbourg for his vote in 
favour of the Funding System. J. Q. A. was offered 
fifty shares in our <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Bank for his vote in favour 
of it. He refused and opposed the Institution, which 
first provoked the eternal vengeance of the Junto. His 
opposition in the Senate would have prevailed if the 
Federalists had not won over Skinner and Bidwell 
the two famous uncorrupted Republicans who made 
them a bare Majority of one vote. I can give you another Anecdote of a more allarming kind. Mr. King 
told me, that General Gun assured him that Mr. Swan 
offered him Ten Thousand Dollars for his vote and Influence, in a Question in the Senate, and I have been 
informed that a large sum of Money was shipped in 
Hambourg for <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> for the express purpose of 
promoting and securing the first election of Mr. Jefferson as President. Venal Presses and venal Scriblers 
have undoubtedly been supported by French and English Intrigues. Corruption from abroad and Corruption 
at home we shall no doubt have in abundance. 

I will barely hint at two Instances of Corrupt Influence of Banks. Dr. Tufts one of the best Men in the 
world, had been chosen a Senator for near twenty 
years I believe, and the last year he had an unanimous 
vote in the Town of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and with an abatement of 
only two or three in the whole County. In short there 
was not a Senator half so popular for half so long a 
Time. But a Posse petitioned for The Union Bank. 
Tufts was a Man of sense and voted against it At 
the next election all the engines of speculators were set 
to work in all the Towns in the County, and the pious, 
virtuous, learned, ingenious, upright and incorruptible 
Tufts was turned out, and has never been in since. 

The same year my Brother Peter Boylston Adams 
Esqr. was chosen Representative for the Town of 
<a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>, it being the first year after it was separated 
from <a href='/results.php?city=braintree' rel='city'>Braintree</a> and erected into a Town by itself. He 
also was a Man of Sense, Spirit and Honour. Upon 
the Question of the Union Bank he saw its corrupt 
Tendency and gave his Nay against it. The Gallery 
was full of Speculators, and upon his Nay being pronounced The Cry in the Gallery, loud enough to be 
heard by Many, was ** God damn the Nays, who would 
have expected a Nay from that Quarter." All their 
Engines were set to work in all the Taverns and Dram 
Shops of our Town of <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>, and at the next election My Brother was turned out and has never been in 
since. Since that we have been constantly represented 
by an Irishman, a Liverpool Man or a <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Man. 
The Cry against Peter at our Dram Shops was, he voted 
against the new Bank and is a Dupe of his Brother the 
Vice President. Any Cry will do when reinforced by 
Rum Whiskey or Toddy or Porter enough, at Alehouses Taverns dram shops or Nanny Houses in England or America. 

What shall we say ? The most unblemished Characters in this Country, have been and are as deep in this 
Mire, of Banks, Stocks and Speculation of all sorts, as 
the most profligate and abandoned. Phillips has erected 
a magnificent Block of Brick Buildings in one of the 
most conspicuous spots in the Town and called it Hamilton Place, in Honour of his System of Funds and 
Banks by which his Phillips's Father and himself have 
made immense Fortunes. And where can you find 
purer Characters than the Phillips's? Hancock and 
Gill, Jarvis Austin and all the Democrats were engaged 
the Union Bank. Again what shall we say? who shall 
throw the first stone ? 

I am disgusted with this nauseous subject. Adieu. 
Adieu. <a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">John Adams</a>.

Dear Sir, — As I am never weary of writing to you, because I write always without thinking, I am not sorry to be obliged to begin another Letter and another sheet. 

J. Q. A. in a Letter to his Brother T. B. A. dated St. Petersbourg 27 October 1810 has these words, viz: 

I wish you to procure and send to me a specimen of every one of the Coins of the Mint of the United States, of Gold — Silver — and Copper, viz : an Eagle, 
Half Eagle, Quarter Eagle. Dollar, half dollar, quarter dollar. Ten Cent and five Cent piece — Cent and half Cent, as new as you can procure, or at least perfect in 
execution and undefaced. I want them for a Collection. Perhaps by the Friendship of Dr. Rush you can procure them new from The Mint And to save the 
trouble of forwarding them to you, perhaps he will be kind enough to send them to me by some spring vessel from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. You wll transmit to him the amount 
of their value, and charge it in account to me." 

Now, my good Friend, will you be so good as to let 
me know whether you will undertake this kind office. 
Whether you send them from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> direcdy to 
Petersburg which will probably be the best way, or 
whether you send them to me or my son here at 
<a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a> I will be answerable that the Money shall be 
remitted to you immediately by myself or by Thomas Boylston Adams. 

Since I have been obliged to begin a new sheet for 
this Little Piece of Business, I may say a few words in 
answer to your last Concerning the Resurrection of 
Letters. You allow that "an attention to the dead 
Languages has revived in Europe," but alledge that 
" Napoleon is at the head of the Junto confederated to 
restore them." 

I will not deny him the Glorj- that is due to him. It 
is true that no Man, Prince or subject, has distinguished 
himself more by the Patronage of Science, Litterature 
and the fine Arts than Napoleon. This and Toleration, 
are the brightest Jewells in his Crown. I cannot however do so much honour to him as to ascribe this second Resurrection of Learning to him, it is rather due to 
the American Revolution. That great event turned 
the Thoughts and studies of Men of Learning to the 
ancient Greeks, their Language, their Antiquities, their 
Forms of Government. Anacharsis Gillies, Mitford, La 
Harpe, and a thousand other works in France, England, 
Holland, Germany and Italy were produced by the American Revolution before Bonaparte made any Figure. 

The Darkness and Ignorance of the fourteenth and 
fifteenth Centuries were dispelled, and a new Glory 
spread over Mankind by the discovery of the Classics 
and the Corpus Juris at Constantinople and Amalphi: 
how then can you imagine that the same Darkness and 
Ignorance can be brought back by the very studies 
which scattered them : i. e. by a new Resurrection of the 
same Learning. 

We need not fear that Latin and Greek will ever be 
too much studied. Not one in ten thousand of those 
who study them in schools and Colledges ever make 
any great Proficiency in them. In general Scollars are 
enabled to understand their own Languages the better 
for the smattering they acquire in the Classicks, and to 
examine a Passage occasionally in. Latin, &amp;c. 

But you must be weary by this time of common Place 

thoughts of your Friend

Dear Sir, — In your Favour of the 4th. according to 
my Judgment you have given up the whole Controversy, You have no objection you say to teaching the 
youth in our schools to read the dead Languages. By 
reading them, no doubt you meant that they should so 
read them as to understand them, and they can be read 
to be understood in no way so well as by writing and speaking them. I therefore regret very much the discontinuance, in the Universities of Europe and America, 
of the Practice and Fashion of talking in Latin. I regret 
too the exchange of French for Latin as the Language 
of Courts, Camps, Travellers, Merchants, Science and 
Letters. If Franklins division of the Labour of acquiring a Language into ten Parts be correct, I think 
the five for reading, the two for speaking and the three 
for writing should all be employed, and the whole Ten 
will be little enough to acquire a Language as it should 
be mastered. The late wonderful increase of knowledge in all useful Arts and Sciences, will facilitate the 
acquisition of Languages as much as other Things. 
The profound Investigations of the Principles of all 
Languages, and universal Grammar, and the great variety of excellent Translations into English, French, 
Italian, German, &amp;c. will make the Progress more easy 
and delightful than ever it has been. 

I most cordially congratulate you and my Friend Mr. Rush, on his unsolicited and unexpected appointment 
to the very respectable and very important office of 
Attorney General of the State of Pensilvania. Gentlemen of his Talents, Accomplishments, Wisdom and 
Moderation, I fear are very rare : but among those who 
might be found, it appears to me that neither the 
People, nor their Government have been very fortunate in their Elections or Selections. Parties have too 
much Influence and are too monopolizing and exclusive 
in their dispositions. 

I rejoice in the appearance on the stage of another 
Benjamin Rush. May he live as long as his Grandfather has lived or shall live and serve his Species and 
his Country as meritoriously. 
The Rage for Banks is a Fever a Mania. I wish you 
would invent a Tranquillizer to tame it. Every Bank 
in America is an enormous Tax upon the People for 
the Profit of Individuals. All the salaries of all the 
officers of all our Government, State and National, do 
not cost the People so much Money as these Banks. 
But I despair of ever seeing Common Sense prevail in Money Matters in America. No People ever 
had so much Experience of the Injustice, Impolicy and 
Inhumanity of Paper Money : but Experience and 
Demonstration is lost upon us. Our Banks are the 
Madness of the Many for the Profit of a Few. If the 
Termination of the National Bank is to be a Precedent 
for the demolition of all the rest I should rejoice in its 
end : but if it is to be a signal for augmenting the 
number of State Banks it will cure no distemper, prevent no evil. Our Banks are all founded upon a fundamental Principle of Iniquity. It requires, however, 
great Prudence, Moderation and Delicacy to extricate 
us from these Briars without scratching the Skin and 
lacerating the Flesh. 

I will write to my Neighbour Mr. Quincy in Congress and ask the favour of him to take The Coins with 
him to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> when he returns ; unless you should 
receive a different advice from me or my son Thomas 
before Mr. Quincy arrives at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. Mr. Quincy
is my Neighbour and Friend, though we are not precisely in the same system of Politicks, at present. 

I wish to be informed of the amount of the Coins, 
that we may remit it to you. I am my dear Sir, as 

ever yours

My dear Friend, — I thank you for the Trouble you have kindly taken in procuring the Samples of Coins 
for my Son J. Q. A. which Mr. Quincy was so good as to deliver with his own hand : and am glad to learn 
from your Letter that Mr. Erving in behalf of my Son T. B. A. has paid you the amount of them. 

I thank you for your Letter of the 4th. of March 
and your Congratulations on the Appointment of my 
Son to a seat on the Bench ; a situation more agreable 
to me, as it places him out Politicks as well as Negotiation,' than any other to which he could be appointed. 
But sub Rosa I have doubts whether he will like it so 
well : because I apprehend he will feel as his Father felt 
on his Return from Europe. I would not have accepted 
the office of a Judge for this reason and no other, that 
I apprehended myself after an inattention to the science 
and practice of Law for fourteen years, not sufficiendy 
familiar with its Principles, Precepts and Forms to 
qualify me for a station so momentous to the dearest 
Interests of my Fellow Citizens. 

Above all I thank you for The Volume of your Lectures ; to me a very precious Present. Your writings 
are always as entertaining as The Lady of The Lake 
and much more instructive. They are a vast Magazine 
of Ideas novel and original calculated to excite and assist every enquiring Mind in the pursuit of Branches 
of Knowledge the most useful to Mankind and most 
essential to their Happiness. 

The Legislature of Massachusetts in their last session, created a Corporation for the purpose of establishing a Public Hospital and were pleased without my 
Knowledge to appoint me a most useless and unworthy 
Member of it I know of but service I can possibly 
render to this honourable Institution and that is by 
presenting them with your learned and experienced 
Lecture up this humane and noble subject. And 
this will be a very minute service, because I have no 
doubt my excellent and honourable Colleagues will be 
possessed of the Book, long before we meet. I hope 
your Bookseller will transmit a number of these Volumes to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> for sale. 

I am not prone to Flattery : and if I were you would 
neither love me the better nor esteem me the more for 
indulging the disposition. It is no more than Justice 
to say that your Reputation as a Physician is jusdy 
higher and more extensive than that of any one who 
has ever lived in America : and as a Lecturer you certainly stand unrivalled. If my son could be thought 
the second Sublimi feriam Sidera Vertice. 

I want to write a Line to your Attorney General who 

is worthy of his Father. Health and Long Life, not so 

much for your enjoyment as for the general good of 

Mankind and for no Individual out of your own Family 

more than

As Charite commens par soi mfime, or as we more 
elegantly express it, as Charity begins at home, I shall 
first resent the domestic part of your dramatic Dialogue 
of the 13th. 

The prosperous and promising Circumstances of 
every Branch of your Family gives me unfeigned Pleasure. The only excepdoa rs to be deplored, bat not in 
desrain Richard is mv Friend hv a sort of Inheritance. He carLnoc tiii to do weil if he is careful to preserve his health, an article as r^uch in danger at the Bar 
as in sick Chambers and rnidnight visits. 

Xow tor my riirru My Companion in Prosperity

quainred with her: bcr tire same inde&amp;tigable exertions tor her Familv. and all her Friends as weii as her 
Children and Grand Children, still continue, and her 
Friendship ibr \i?u aad voiirs is not diminished. 

My son Thomas Boylston. has much ill healtru and 
has lately met an unrbrrsinarre accident which has coanned him 6?r se\-eral weeks, bv a Fail of his Horse. 
His wound is now in a ^oc way and he has been twice 
our to ri.de. once to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> and once ro \Ve\Tnoutfa. He 
has three pretr\^ Children, two daughters and a son: 
and ceradvenrjre a 5?urth bv this time whose Birth we 
expect to hear every Momen:! Our Le^'slature have 
i^'v^n him a seat in CounseL where I hope he will girt 
diitiinil o-dvioe to The C-ovemor according to the oath 
which he lias nken.

Her Dauorhner Caroline is with her Parents, and is a 
charming Girl. Charles's Widow and two Daughters 
arc with me. The Daughters are grown up, and are 
good Girls : one has remarkable Abilities. The other 
not deficient. 

I expect John Quincy, with some little scepticism 
however, in all October or November. 

I am well. My Appetite is as good as ever. I sleep 
well o Nights. No Burdens, whether Grashoppers or 
Mammoths of Body or Mind afifect me. I still enjoy a 
Chair in this Study: but avoid close Thinking from 
Principle. My natural vision is not bad, but I use 
Glasses for ease to my eyes, which you have known to 
be weak and subject to Inflammations for almost forty 
years. My Hearing, for any Thing that I perceive or 
my Friends have remarked to me is as good as ever. 
So much for the bright side. On the other I have 
a "Quiveration.'* What in the Name of the Medical 
Dictionary, you will say, is a " Quiveration ?'* A wild 
Irish Boy, who lives with my son T. B., let a Horse run 
away with a Chaise. One of the Family ran out and 
cryed out Nat ! why did you not scream out and call for 
help ? Sir ! Sir ! said Nat, I was seized with such a 
Quiveration that I could not speak. Nat's Quiveration 
is the best word I know to express my Palsy. It does 
not as yet much incommode me in writing, though my 
hands are chiefly affected. Another Circumstance on 
the dark side is my organs of speech are gone. It 
would divert you to witness a Conversation between 
my ancient Friend and Colleague Robert T. Paine and 
me. He is above eighty. I cannot speak and he cannot hear. Yet we converse. Thus I have given a particular answer to every one of your Questions. 

And now how shall I turn my Thoughts from this 
good humoured Small Talk to the angry turbulent 
stormy Science of Politicks. 

But previously I am in no fear of forgetting or being 
forgotten by my old Friend Rush. 

I am quite at my ease about the Battle. Regretting 
the honest Fellows however who were killed and 
wounded, it is a matter of indifference to me which ship 
fired first. I feel as I did after the Battle of <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a>. 
A great solicitude appeared in Congress to ascertain 
by oaths affidavits and Depositions, which fired first 
I was thought to aim at Independence, because I declared in Congress that I did not care a Farthing about 
this Question. Since it was become apparent that a 
War was inevitable, it was of no moment which commenced Hostilities, for Hostilities alone could decide 
the Controversy between the two Countries. Yet certainly they were better Politicians than I because they 
studied and laboured to have appearances on their side. 

I am sorry to find from your Letter that The <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> 
Tories who gave the Tone to those of all the Continent from 1 761 to 1783, continue to give it to those 
of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> in 1811. At the same time forget not, 
that the Whigs of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> gave the Tone to the Whigs 
of the Continent. Let not the importance of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> 
to this Union be forgotten. 

You ought to read Gerrys speech. It is in the genuine Whiggish style of 1765 and 1775. He is the same 
enlightened, indefatigable and persevering Patriot. 

"Louis 14, if not the greatest King, was the best 
Actor of Majesty that ever wore a Crown" said Bolinbroke. 

Our Citizens in our great commercial Cities, if they 
are not the greatest Politicians that ever lived, are 
great Masters of the Theatrical Exhibitions of Politicks. 
Were there ever more striking Coups de Theatre than 
Mock Funerals? Or our Celebrations of The Rock 
on which my great, great, great, great, [and I know 
not how many more greats] Grandfather John Alden 
at twenty years of age first leaped at <a href='/results.php?city=plymouth' rel='city'>Plymouth</a> in 
1620. This Institution however is dying away because it was found to excite too much Calvinism and 
Puritanism : and perhaps too high a spirit of Liberty. 
Washington understood this Art very well, and we may 
say of him, if he was not the greatest President he was 
the best Actor of Presidency we have ever had. His 
address to The States when he left the Army: His 
solemn Leave taken of Congress when he resigned his 
Commission : his Farewell Address to the People when 
he resigned his Presidency. These were all in a strain 
of Shakespearean and Garrickal excellence in Dramatic Exhibitions. 

We Whiggs attempted somewhat of the kind. The 
Declaration of Independence I always considered as a 
Theatrical Show. Jefferson ran away with all the stage 
effect of that : i. e. all the Glory of it. 

The Exception from Pardon of Hancock and Adams, 
had a like effect. This however was not their Contrivance nor any Device of our Party. It was an Incident in the Play that was not prepared by the author or 
actors. It was considered by the People and justly as 
decisive Proof of Sin, in the sense of their Enemy, and 
of saintship in their own sense. 

We never instituted Mock Funerals for Warren, 
Montgomery, Mercer, Wooster, or Hancock or Franklin or Sam Adams or Patrick Henry or R. H. Lee, or 
James Otis or John Dickinson. 
This IS a more modern Discovery and Improvement 
of the great Art of Aristocratical Trick, Intrigue, Manoeuvre or what you please to call it. The Usury of 
Roman Senators must be inforced by military force, or 
Roman Catholick Jesuitism. 

But all these Arts are not equal to that of making 
immense fortunes however scandalous, per saltum, in a 
twinkling of an eye, by a financiering operation, which 
substitutes a Paper Money, whose immense depreciations go into the Pocketts of a few Individuals in Lieu 
of a Paper Money whose depreciations are in favour of 
the whole People. A curse on Paper Money of all 
kinds ! 

But enough ! Enough ! of this ill Nature. It restores 
all my good Nature to bid you adieu as your old 
Friend. 

I wish you would come and see me in Reality, in my 

Room, Chamber Study, Office or whatever you please 

to call it. Why not? with Mrs. Rush or the young 

Ladies, or both, or all ?.

My venerable Friend, — Be pleased to accept my 
cordial congratulations on the felicity of your Family 
in the arrival of your Son and Daughter from Europe. 
The Doctor will be the staff of your age and you will be 
the Guide of his youth. The Daughter and her infants 
will be the delight of her Mother as well as her Father. 

For myself, clothed as I am in sable, I may without 
repining acknowledge the seventy sixth year of my age 
to have been the most afflictive of my life. 
In January 1811 died very suddenly, leaving a distressed and helpless Family of eight children, Mrs. Norton, a Niece of my Wife, a Daughter of my Brother 
and sister Cranch who was always as dear to us as a 
child. 

In April a Horse took fright in a Brook, reared and 
fell against a Stone Bridge, and bruised and wounded 
my son T. B. A. in his Thigh, in such a manner as to 
lay him up for several Months under the Care of his 
Surgeons in great danger of being a Cripple for Life. 

In June my sister Cranch, in her seventieth year 
oppressed with Grief for the loss of her Daughter and 
with anxiety, Care and exertion for her orphan Children fell sick of a Fever and lingered under the Consequences of it for four Months. 

Mr. Cranch my Guide Philosopher and Friend for 
sixty years, at the age of eighty five, borne down by 
the Loss of his Daughter and sickness of his wife fell at 
last very suddenly on the 16 Oct. and his wife expired 
the next day. Both were buried together in my Tomb. 

In June my Daughter in Law, Charles's Widow who 
with her two Daughters lives with me, was taken with 
a vomiting of blood, which has confined her under the 
constant Care of Physicians for three or four months 
and reduced her to extream weakness. She is now 
however somewhat better. 

My Daughter Smith's case you know, a source of 
great anxiety to us for more than a year was at last 
happily terminated by your advice as we hope, but at 
a time when so many calamities concurred as to make 
the excision of a Ladys Breast appear but a small 
affliction. 

Two Months since going out in the dark in my Garden 
to look for the Comet I stumbled over a Knot in a 
Stake and tore my Leg near the shin in such a manner 
that the surgeon with his Baths, Cataplasms, Plaisters 
and Bandages has been daily hovering about it and 
poor I, deprived of my Horse and my walks have been 
bolstered up with my Leg horrizontal on a Sopha. 

Mr. Smith a near Relation and most intimate Friend 
of ours in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> had a son of most promising Hopes 
educated at the University and the Bar an officer in a 
Cadet Corps of Militia, in the unprecedent heat of 
the 4th. of July got a Fever that left him in a Consumption of which he died. 

The News of the Death of Mrs. Johnson and Mr. Buchannan her son in Law, and the dangerous sickness 
of her Daughters and the dangerous sickness in the 
Family of Judge Cranch at Washington arrived in the 
midst of all our other distresses. 

It is scarcely decent after all this to mention the disappointment of our hopes of the return of our Children 
from Russia. 

Such my Friend is the Lott of humanity. But the 
Case of our Calamities has rarely been equaled since 
the days of Job. Yours however in the time of the 
yellow Fever were more distressing. 

Several of our tenderest Connections and most essential Friends at and near fourscore remain to keep 
up a constant apprehension in our Minds of their and 
our approaching departure. 

The Reflections dictated by Philosophy and Religion 
upon these events need not be suggested to you, to 
whom they are quite as familiar as to your Friend 

<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">John Adams</a>.

Dr. Sir, — You have forgotten old Dr. Shippen, Dr. Franklin, and many others : I have known many Instances. Not to mention General Oglethorp or Mrs. Cope or many others. I knew a Miss Sarah Mills married first to Mr. Neal and afterwards to Mr. Thayer. 
She pretended to have been one of my Fathers boyish 
Flames, and upon the strength of this great merit she 
made me a visit once a year riding down six or seven 
miles upon a Pillion behind a Boy. She loved wine, with 
moderation, and we gave her her fill. She wanted 
Money to help her thro' the year and we always gave 
her a little. She staid as long as she pleased, and had 
the best Beds and Tables our house afforded. Her 
Health of body and mind was as perfect as ever it had 
been. She was always profuse in her expressions of 
gratitude to her human Benefactors, not forgetting her 
divine. Her concluding Sentence always was " God is 
wonderful to me !" She visited us annually till she was 
One hundred and two. I may adopt her pious Motto. 

Conclude not from this that I flatter my self with the 
hope of long life. No such thing. My constitution is 
a orlass bubble : an hollow licecickle. A blast from the 
South West or North East may break or dissolve it in 
an hour. A slight Irregularity or one intemperate dinner might finish the Catastrophy of the Play. A French 
Bishop said to me speaking of Franklin ^yhen he was 
younger than I am ** II ne faudra, que tres peu de chose, 
a son age, pour abbatre un colosse.'' 

Vanity is one of your ** diseases of the Mind." You 
and all the world know to what a scandalous degree I 
have been infected with it all the days of my life. Jones 
and Barry were leprous with it when the first said " My 
hand first hoisted the American Flag :" and the last was 
not less distempered with it when he said ** The British 
Naval Flag first struck to me." Both these boasts 
were vain and false. Both were true only in the mouth 
of John Manly ; whose Prizes were of more importance 
to this Country than all that Jones or Barry both ever 
performed. 

I respect your Science and Humanity as a Veterinarian : but is there not a little " disease of the mind*' in 
your and Howards and Burkes enthusiasm for old 
Horses. The weakness is amiable : but I doubt the 
real rational humanity of it. The old Farmers maxim 
is founded in more judicious experience " If you would 
have an old Man or an old horse good for any thing 
you must keep him always going, always in use." This 
is conformable to my experience of Man and Horse. 
Burkes affection was not for the horse but for his son, 
whom from a distemper of the mind he adored, and to 
whom he had hoped to transmit that Peerage which was 
the object of his invariable Aim and pursuit : as really 
as a Bishoprick in England was that of Dr. Swift 
Would not the expence of keeping old useless Horses 
be mare humanely employed in relieving Prisoners, 
Orphans and Widows ? 

The old white Charger is a different story. I never 
heard of but one Charger in America : nor of more 
than one banquetting room. Were not both these 
Titles given from some little lurking disease of the 
Mind? 

Your Book has made it very clear and very certain 
that we all labour under diseases of the Mind. When 
I lived in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, an ingenious French Peruquier who 
made and dressed my Barristers Wiggs, and shaved 
my face, once told me a story of an English Nobleman, 
who came to his shop in London where he had dressed 
heads and shaved faces some years before he came 
over and talked and behaved very extravagantly. But 
said the Barber ** His Lordship was a leetle crack : indeed all de Mylors in England are crack." 

You have proved that we are all crack, insomuch 
that I am almost afraid to read it all, least I should see 
my own Character in the mirror and see more symptoms of mental Malady. The Book is in so much 
request among my five inquisitive Females, that I could 
not keep it, and then my Neighbour Dr. Vinton one of 
your ardent admirers, must have it, and he has let others 
read it, and I cannot get it. But I have read enough 
to make me tremble. 

Other Things however more seriously alarm me. 
My son in Law is chosen to Congress, and by a vast 
majority against a formidable Competitor. The Consequence of this I know not. You shall divine from the 
inclosed Letter to me, which upon your Friendship you 
must return to me by the next Post or two. His election is a demonstration of the Confidence and affection 
of two large Counties containing near 50,000 souls in 
which he has lived in Poverty and Obscurity for many 
years. He must now meet on the same Floor the most 
malicious and insidious Tool in Tim. Pickering, of the 
most jealous envious and malicious enemy he ever had, 
Alexander Hamilton: both of whom together accomplished his Ruin. 

I mourn for our Friend Clymer. With him I admit 
the outrages of both France and England: but I dread 

the Power of neither. I dread nothing but the disease 

20 
of the Mind in my own dear beloved Nation. But that 
must and will be cured. So wishes, so prays, so hopes 
and so undoubtingly believes 

the same semper idem 

<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">John Adams</a>.

I am glad Waterhouse has a son with you. The 
Father commands one of the most elegant and masterly pens in America. He is a Jewell of a Man and 
has been most cruelly used because he is a Friend of 
the national Government and because he writes better 
books than any of his Profession here.

Friend, — I agree with you that The Ocean ought to be and must be The Theatre of the War. Our Government will come by degrees to the right system. 

I have toasted the Wooden Walls, the Floating 
Castles, the floating Batteries and the floating Citidels 
of The United States for six and thirty years : and I 
now rejoice to find that many Persons now begin to 
drink my Toasts with Huzzas. 

I am quite of The Controulers Mind, that there is no 
doubt of Mr. Madisons Re-election. Who can stand 
in Competition ? Gen. Pinkney, Gen. Armstrong, Vice 
President Clinton? Oh No. Respectable worthy 
Men, but far inferiour in Talents, Industry and especially Popularity. No Man in the Union can compete 
with The Locum Tenens at present 

I am really grieved for you, under the Loss of your 
Son. But I am deeply impressed with an Idea that 
your Loss will be his and his Country's Gain. 

Mr. Gerry's speech is too long, because it tells too 
many solemn Truths. I know of no other Man in the 
United States whose nerves would have borne him out 
in telling so many. I should not have dared : and yet 
I do not think myself a very timorous Politician. Yet 
it was necessary. Gerry is a Wedge prepared by <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> to split a lignum vitae knot here, as hard as 
Luther had to split in Germany. 

Let me introduce to you, Mr. Richard Cranch Norton 
an amiable and ingenious young Gentleman of education and to beg a Line of Introduction to The Con
trouler. _ _ 

I am forever yours 

<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">John Adams</a>.

P.S. — My Rib says I have not been particular enough. Mr. Norton is a Grandson of my Brother and her Brother and Sister Cranch, a Nephew of Chief Justice Cranch of the Columbian District under whom he is studying Law. You I think and the Controuller too must I think be pleased with his Modesty, Civility and 
Ingenuity. He was the first Man in America who discovered the Commet last May. He is the Son of a Learned Divine in Weymouth.

Dear Sir, — I shall expect your long Letter: but I 
ought not to wish it with Impatience : for you have 
such demands upon you for your Time : that I wonder 
how you can spare any to write answers to my Impertinences. The Astonishment of your Family at my 
Vivacity is very just. Rochefaucault says when a 
Mans Vivacity increases with years it becomes Frenzy 
at last. Nothing is indeed more ridiculous than an 
old Man more than three quarters of a hundred, rattling like a Boy of fifteen at School or at Colledge. I 
am ashamed of it, yet ten to one I shall fall into it 
again, before I finish this Letter : for I feel at least forty 
years younger when I am writing to you. Martinus 
Scriblerus would pronounce my Imagery to be drawn 
from a lower deep than the lowest deep of the Bathos. 
There is no Delicacy in it. Swift whose wild Imagination could create Brobdignagians and Lilliputians and 
the thousand wonders of his Travels and Fables calculates every Figure with mathematical exactness and 
not an Image or a Metaphor is admitted that is not 
neat, exact and compleat. Though every word in his 
Prose and Verse, comes as natural and flows as easy 
as water down an uniform inclined plain, yet I cannot 
conceive it possibly could be accomplished without the 
most profound patience, and obstinate determined 
study. I dare say he copied over all he wrote as often 
as Demosthenes copied Thucidides. I would not undertake to write one Page of Swift's Poetry or Prose 
under half a year. And yet Dr. Blair has convicted 
him of breaking Priscians head in a Number of Instances. I thank you sir and your Lady for your kind 
Civilities to my modest, amiable and ingenious young 
Nephew Mr. Richard Cranch Norton. He has gratefully acknowledged his obligations to your Family in 
his Letters to his own here. 

The Renovation of an ancient Correspondence has 
been an agreeable Circumstance. It cannot last long 
for one Party must very soon yield to Nature her dues. 
But I am surprized to find that a Winter Journey on 
Horseback of Ninety Miles is performed to visit a Plantation ! I would not undertake it for the Fee Simple 
of the United States with unlimited Dominion over 
their Inhabitants with their own Consent. I am afraid 
my Friend Jefferson has become worldly minded. 

For myself I care nothing about this world, except 
as it is a Part of a system of which the remotest fixed 
star in the Gallaxy or in Herschells Nebulae and every 
Satilite about it is as essential as ours. Yet I am as 
anxious for my Children, Grand Children, Country, 
Europe at times as Fisher Ames. Such incongruous 
Creatures we are. And such we must be till we take 
our Lessons from the great Teacher to whom I am 
desirous of going to school as soon as eternal Wisdom 

shall think fit.

Dear Sir, — Mrs. Rush may be assured that I have 
no doubt of her Friendship for me. The Familiarities 
and Jocularities in question have been too often experienced by me for fifty years, for me to be ignorant of 
the spirit of them. I must confess that I have received 
much good advice and many wholesome Admonitions 
and Remonstrances in this way : as I believe you have 
too. And we must both of us confess that we have 
often wanted them. 

What are we to think of History ? What dependence can we have on Tradition ? It lay as a confused 
recollection in my head, that the little Flirt between 
Jefferson and me [the only one that ever happened 
during our Lives] was occasioned by a Motion for Congress to sit on Sunday. If your Memory and mine 
differ in so recent a transaction, what are we to think 
of the Traditions of the Roman Church? What of 
the Traditions of the North American Indians? The 
latter I believe are the least fraudulent. 

You also have misremembered another Circumstance. It was not Mr. Grenville, but The Earl of 
Hilsborough, who held the Dialogue with Mr. Laurens. 
Hilsborough said "it was not the Revenue they expected to obtain from America, but you spread too 
much Canvas upon the Ocean. Do you think we will 
let you go on with your Navigation and your Forty 
thousand Seamen ?'' But even in this last sentence 
there is a variation between your Memory and mine. 
I think his Lordship said, " Do you think we will suffer 
those New Englandmen to go on with their Navigation 
and their forty thousand Seamen ?'* Meaning to accomodate himself to Mr. Laurens's local views, and 
partial prejudices as a Southern Man and a South 
Carolinian, by insinuating that the Controversy was 
not with his Country, but with New England : and 
thereby contribute something to prevent or break the 
Union of The Colonies. 

To correct the Sentiments and rectify the Conduct 
of a Nation, it is necessary to employ a propriety and 
precision of intelligible Language. Why then my 
Friend, do you speak of a Democratic Ticket ? Mr. Madison nor Mr. Jefferson ever pretended to be Advocates for a Democratical Government. The great Body

Never were three words better coined or applied* 
than your ''bebanked, bewhiskied, and bedollared*' 
Nation. 

The Profits of our Banks to the ad\*antage of the 
few, at the loss of the many, are such an enormous 
fraud and oppression as no other Nation ever invented 
or endured. Who can compute the amount of the 
sums taken out of the Pocketts of the Simple and 
hoarded in the Purses of the cunninor in the course of 
every year. Yet where is the Remedy ? The Republicans are as deep in this absurdity' and this Guilt as the 
Federalists.

I have read nothing from Congress witli so much 
pleasure or Profit as the motion to raise annually a 
Revenue of six millions of dollars, on four and twenty 
Millions of Gallons of Whiskey. 

Adieu.

My dear Friend, — I beg you would not consider yourself obliged to answer my Letters. Your Time is precious, mine of no value. 

I thank you for the contrast. Striking it is.  General Mifflin behaved nobly. But Muhlenbourgs, Coxes &amp;c. 
&amp;c. how did they? In Strong and Goodhue you see 
the Whiggism or rather the Republicanism of Strait 
Hair : as well as in Pickering. Liberty sometimes 
wears Strait Hair : but strait hair is not the infallible 
Costume of Liberty. 

A hint for your History. Lincoln and Strong were 
fellow students in Major Hawleys office at Northampton in 1773, 4, 5. Lincoln was the brightest Genius, 
the most studious and the most learned, and the most 
enterprizing. He distinguished himself by his Writings 
as early as 1774 or 1775. But there has been a Rivalry 
between them to this hour. How great an effect has 
this "Rivalite** produced! And what Historian but 
you will ever know any Thing about it ? 

There is an alliance between our Essex Junto and 
our New England Theologians, Unitarians and Athanasians, Hopkintonians and Freewillers and all ; Bos, 
Fur, Sus atque Sacerdos : with a few bright exceptions. 
If a Galladns Rebellion or a Fries's Rebellion should 
be excited by this Coalition \\ \\\\\ not call it strange] 
Madison will have nothing to do but imitate my example [proud and impudent as it is in me to say it] he 
need not put the Nation to the expense nor make the 
ostentatious Parade of Washington to suppress it My 
opinion however is clear there will be no Commotion 
at all. The object of all this spiritual and temporal 
Bluster is to get Madison out But who to get in? 
lav? Clinton? Pinknev? higrhlv as I esteem the first 
and ignorant as I am of any objection to the other t\i'o 
I own I prefer Madison to all three at the present 
Moment. John Randolph's Conscience recollects the 
Insolence of himself and Part)* on their Trjumph. But 
I am the less anxious on this point because I know that 
bring in who they will, he cannot essentially or materially 
depart from Madisons present system. Madison and 
Madisonians however should consider that whoever 
succeeds him will cherrish a Naval Defense. And if he 
is rejected, it will be because he has not sufficiendy 
advocated, as I was turned out because I too explicidy 
recommended, it. 

There are several Members of the House who have 
attracted my attention, and convinced me that our 
Country abounds with Intelligence and Talent A Calhoun, a Lounds. a Cheves, a Clay, a Porter. These 
appear to me to be sensible Men and honest. Grundy 
and Harper too. John Randolph appears to be so 
tormented by his Conscience in recollecting his own 
Conduct in the i8th. Centur)^ that he is nearly fit for 
your Chair. 

I know not whether you have read the Address to the 
people of the State by our H. of Reps, or that of the 
Minority in the H. of Rep. in Congress to the People 
of the Union. I wish my eyes would suffer me to 
write Commentaries on these two studied Compositions. They would however be of no use to you. 
Your own sense will perceive them all. I am really 
grieved : I am ashamed : I am confounded to read such 
Sophistry, such Insincerity, such want of Candor or 
want of Information in such Bodies of American Citizens. If Jugurtha should see this to be the  General Character of American Citizens what would he say? 
We know what he said on taking Leave of Rome, 
** Urbem venalem, mature perituram, si mode emptorem 
invenerit." Both Parties in the United States have exhibited strong symptoms, made bold and daring advances beyond the Boundaries of Morality into the 
Regions of Ambition, Selfishness and Rapacity. And 
who or what shall stop them in their Career ? The Lawgivers of Antiquity, Solon, Lycurgus, Numa, Zeleucus 
legislated for single Cities. But who can Legislate for 
1 8, 20 or 30 States, each of which is greater than all 
Greece or Rome at those times. No human Mind I 
believe, certainly none that has yet appeared in America 
is equal to it. 

Neither Party will bear a third Power as an Umpire. 
It is tolerated only as a Tool. Aristocratia and Democratia will still pull caps : will tear each others eyes and 
scratch each others visages, I will not be so gross as to 
say suck each others blood, till some Alexander, Caesar, 
Zingis, Mahomet, Cromwell, Napoleon, Hamilton or 
Burr with an Army of Conscriptions shall make Peace: 
or rather make a Solitude and call it Peace. Solitudinem faciant Pacem appellant. Great long bloody and 
terrible will be the Conflict before this is all effected. 
Yoo and I shaD not see iL But I could snivel like 
Ames for my Children and Grand Children. But what 
are my Posterity more than others ? If ever}' one who 
sprung trom my Lmns was split and broiled like a 
Maccarei what is that to the Fate of Mankind, or to 
the future, or the present Millions oi America ? The 
Dangers of American Libert&gt;-, of French Liberty, of 
Dutch Liberty, of English Liberty, of Genevan Liberty 
and of Swiss Libert\*. were ^ring enough in my Boudoir, long before Fisher Ames's babyish sobs were 
heard In the Wo rid. 

There is a Comet in our political system. In its progress it sff*ms to be now at Xew York. .A. Burr has 
advertised a Barristers Ottkre. How diiierent and vet 
how similar is this Being to Hamilton, .Ames, H. G. 
Otisc If you were Cicero or I A^cus or vice versa 
these characters might be develloped. But Correspoodence between the most coandendal Friends cannot be so free here, and now, as it was there and then. 
You know Facts in Burrs history that you would not 
communicate :.: me. I know Facts that I have never 
commcnkared t:^ ^"oa. If voa dare, I wiH cslt^ to tefl 
the Trwith. the whole Tnth and aoching but the Truth. 

Vanity and Egodsm is and must be my perpetual 
Theme. Petere Fontres : Pedro Pontes : Pete F«3ates : 
Petite Fonres, rias been my Precepc my Maxim, my 
polar star dirocgh Ud'^ I have uniibrmly sought Prhidpies. Bur where are Principles ? and what are Prlnrcipies ? Take any Principle of Religion. Morals. Poucy. 
Philosophy or comni«oa sense, and compare it -a^lrh

: I wiZ enumerare no niore : and then sav. 
what Principle has governed ? Every one of these will 
say, as I do, and as you will do, ** I have acted on 
Principle." 

There is one Being, who understands the Principles 
of the Universe, and never deviates from them, " I am 
the Lord, I change not" and to him I appeal. I will 
add no more. Except 

Mr. Calhoun speaks as I think. I will not charge 
Jefferson or Madison with Cowardice. I believe it of 
neither. I will not call it weakness, for they are strong 
Men. 

But I say this Country ought to have been better 
prepared for War, especially by sea. This egregious 
defect was want of Judgment and Foresight at least 

In mercy to you and to myself, let me finish by subscribing

P.S. — Do you recollect the outrageous Insolence of 
Tom Paine, Callender, Duane, and John Randolph after 
their Tryumph in 1800, and what was that Tryumph? 
After Millions of Lies, and all their Wit, Genius and 
Talents, aided by every Frenchman on the Continent, 
Wade Hampton and old Sumpter cheated South Carolina out of the real Choice of her People: and after 
seven and thirty Tryals in the House between Jefferson 
and Burr, the former came in by one vote, and I know 
how that vote was obtained, because I obtained it 
This History has not yet been disclosed : but it shall 
not perish. 

If such was the Tryumph of the Democracy, by one 
vote in 1800, and such its Insolence and Impudence, 
what would be the Tryumph of Aristocrac}' in 1S13, 
if it should efteci a Change of Administration in the 
Midst of War ? Our Elxecutive is made a mere Testa 
di Legno. A mere head of wood. A mere Football, 
kicked and tossed by Frenchmen, Elnglishmen or rather 
Scotchmen, and ignorant michievous Boys. And yet 
you and Jefferson think our Execudve too strong.

My dear Friekd, — How shall I, how can I, express 
the gratefull Feelings of my heart for your Friendship 
and Benevolence to me, communicated in your kind 
letter of the twentieth of August? 

I assure you I had some scruples of Conscience, and 
wanted the Aid of a Casuist, to instruct me, whether I 
ought to accept it. If you had allowed me to pay the 
freight Insurance and Duties &amp;c. this would have removed some of the embarrassment If I could convert it into a statue or Picture of Dr. Rush, this would 
afford me and my Family more Pleasure, more admonition and more Information than all the statues Pictures 
and Mausoleums in the world : more than all the wine 
of Samos, Malaga, Madeira or Constantia, or TockaL 
But what need have I of pictures of Dr. Rush. I have 
his works : which in my opinion are of far greater value 
than all the Writings of Franklin, let the roundabout, 
rambling, circumlocutory, everlasting Edinborough Reviewers say what they will. 

After all, knowing and Feeling that the Gift proceeded from pure unadulterated Friendship, I have on 
this third day of September 1812, the twenty ninth Anniversary of the definitive Treaty of Peace of 1 783, 
sent to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> for the Cask. 

And as long as we Antediluvians can drink we will 
toast Dr. Rush his Family and Friends, the 3d. of Sept. 
1783 and the third of Septr. 1812. 

Pray send me the first News you have of your son 
Benjamin, and his Travels in the Countrys of Homer 
and Paul. I am, dear sir your obliged Friend 

<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">John Adams</a>.

My dear Friend, — In the good old English Phrase, 
I give you ten thousand Thanks for the Muscat Wine 
of Samos, which is now in my Cellar, in good order 
and of good Quality. You did not forsee one effect of 
it. It will increase my love of Greek and Latin more 
than my Patriotism. Oh! How I heard a Circle of 
Ladies of the first quality, old and middle aged, and 
young, praise it last evening ! If indeed there is any 
such Thing as qualit)' in our Country. 

When you thanked me, in strict propriety you was in 
error. You did wrong. I gave you nothing. I was 
Trustee for our Country. Had I known a Man more 
fit, more deserving, you would not have been selected. 
You have given me your own. I have accepted your 
own. I ought therefore to give you ten thousand, 
thousand Thanks, and you ought to have given me none 
at all. You have a head metaphisical enough to discern, and an heart suscescible enough to feel these nice 
distinctions : and therefore to be convinced that I ought 
not always to lay under the Weight of this great obligation. 

I feel the Force of all your " But", ** Butt". - Butts". 
I know of but one ** Butt" however, that ought to have 
been decisive. This is the rash Insult to Jefferson and 
Madison, in the Address to Congress. This I give up. 
I would have done as Jefferson did. I could have done 
no otherwise. And this I consider as an eternal sentence against the Man to Poverty and Obscurity and\ 
Inutility. \ 

I never heard him speak of either \Vs. with any Con- I 
tempL He has always been cautious before me. He I 
once sent me when I was President a Bundle of Papers I 
of Complaint against Wilkinson, from Detroit Upon I 
the calmest coolest most impartial and deliberate Con- \ 
sideration of them I thought they did more honor than \ 
any thing else to Wilkinson. The amount of them all * 
was that he had proclaimed Martial Law at Detroit. 
This I believed to be necessary' because the Inhabitants 
there were Tories, and I fear they remain Tories still. 
I therefore acquitted Wilkinson and continued him in 
Command all my time. 

I rejoice in the success of your son Benjamin, and in 
the happiness of all your Family. Benjamin will return 
laden with knowledge and experience. 

You have done wisely in avoiding Controversy about 
the questions whether Apostate Angells, fallen Angels, 
or in other words Devils, possessed the Demoniacs of 
the New Testament or whether Demons, and Belzebub 
the Prince of Demons, possessed People in Judea. 
The great Question whether Demons and their Prince 
are the same spirits as the Devil and his Angels, did 
not necessarily fall within the Compass of your Inquiry. 
Shakespeare and Pringle were not adepts in the 
science of Biblical Criticism, which is now in the full 
tide of successful experiment. [Where will it end?] 
See our <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a> General Repository. 

Have you treated of St. Anthony's Fire, St. Vitus's 
dance, and the Night Mare ? these are all Madness, or 
at least produce Madness. 

The Antients seem to have thought all Madness, 
Possession. The Devil is not once in the New Testament said to possess Man, Woman, Child or Hog. 

The word ^a^/xowov occurs fifty two times : daiixGiv three: 
daifxo),i^oixai thirteen, dta^okoq not once. Search then the 
Distinction between Demon and Devil, and you will 
find it as great as between Heathenism and Christian it)'. 

But what is all this to your purpose? Unless it be 
to give you suspicion that I am in danger of becoming 
a fit subject for your Treatise and your Chair ? 

For my part I am of Opinion, with mad Johnson, that 
all Mankind are a little mad. You cannot therefore 
describe all the species of this distemper nor cure them 
all. I believe none possessed, either by Devil or 
Demon. It is all Vice or distemper, moral or physical 
evil. 

To be sober, I believe Mr. Madison will be again 
elected : and upon the whole, I wish it, because I see 
no Man who will be likely to do better. The Nation 
it is true is greatly and justly allarmed at the Imbecility 
of the last twelve years. But those who brought us 
into this Confusion are the best qualified to bring us 
out of it, if they can be made to attempt it in the right 
way. Madisons private opinions and Jeffersons too, 
are more correct than their public Conduct has been, 
for that has been dictated by their Party. 
Neither Mr. Clinton nor Mr. Jay, nor Mr. Martial, 
nor any other Man that occurs to me could in the 
present Circumstances serve us so effectually as Mr. Madison, if Congress will let him. But if Congress at 
their next session do not commence some serious efforts 
for a Navy, though Mr. Madison may be chosen, a dissaffection will be so deeply radicated in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and 
all the northern States as to parrallyze all the Measures 
of Government and produce a disastrous War, by sea 
and Land, and possibly a rupture of the Union. Besides Mr. Madisons Majority will be very small. 

I am perfectly of your opinion that the federal denial 
of the Justice of the War, by which they identify themselves with the Tories and the English is as great a 
blunder on their part, as any that has been committed 
by their antagonists these twelve years. The Federalists are as apt to stumble as the Republicans, and are 
no more to be trusted than they : yet as the latter are 
in possession of the fond affections of the People they 
can do better, if they will, than the former. I speak 
with defference however, having been so long out of 
the World. 

I am, dear sir, as ever your affectionate and obliged 
Friend

Dear Sir, — If you had investigated the Question, 
concerning Possessions or that about matter and spirit, 
in your Treatise on the Diseases of the Mind it could 
have been only by way of digressions like Swifts digressions concerning Criticks, his digression of the 
modern kind, his digression in praise of digressions, his 
digression concerning Madness, in the Tale of the Tub: 
which although they are all inexpressibly entertaining 
and ineffably ridiculous, I have always wished out of the 
Book, when my Mind has been engaged in the Characters and Conduct of Peter Martin and Jack. 

Whether the Mind, the Intellect, be matter or spirit, 
can never be determined till we know what Matter is 
and what spirit is, and untill we can give a logical or 
mathematical deffinition of both. We know nothing of 
either. We can define neither. We know nothing but 
attributes, qualities and effects. Therefore I think 
Berckley had more sense than Leibnitz, Clark, Bolingbroke or Priestley. Bercley never denied the existence 
of Matter. And Priestley had been wiser, had he not 
denied the existence of spirit. 

You have therefore wisely determined to avoid this 
question as well as the other. The Phenomina which 
you I suppose will call symptoms are certainly all that 
is within your reach. Madness is certainly a distemper 
both of Body and Mind as we distinguish in common 
parlance and vulgar language. 

I agree in all your opinions of Banks, systems, suffrage and Washington City : tho I am not absolutely 
against a Bank and a Fund. Washington City and the 
ten mile square Territory was as corrupt and selfish an 
Intrigue and bargain as any yet occurred, or recorded 
in our history. This never will be recorded, unless it 
should be by me. If I have never related it to you in 
Conversation, I will state it in a Letter if you wish it 

To borrow your own Words ** Wealth, Family Influence, Talents, Industry, Ambition, and Avarice have 

oversett every Republick that has ever yet existed on 
this Globe :" and it may be added in my own, written 
between 20 &amp; 30 years ago, There is no special <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> for us. We are not a chosen People, that I 
know of. If we are, we deserve it as little as The Jews. 
The ignorant, corrupt Coxcomb, who abused me for 
that sentiment did not convince me of its error. I still 
assert we have no reason to believe, that there is a 
special <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> for us. We must and we shall go 
the Way of all the Earth. We ought to contend, to 
swim, though against Wind and tide as long as we can, 
and the poor injured, deceived, mocked and insulted 
People will struggle till Battles and Victories and Conquests dazzle the Majority into adoration of Idols. 
Then come Popes and Emperors, Kingdoms and Hierarchies. 

I wish I could exchange visits of Daughters or grand 
Daughters with you for a few Months or weeks or 
days, but my poor Girls are confined to one narrow 
spot. I congratulate Miss Dexter on her good fortune 
in visiting your Family. 

Last night brought me a report of another act of a 
single day. Van Ranselaer ! I hope it is only fiction. 
But whether true or false : how long shall we blunder 
on ? I am accused of saying last Fall when Canada 
was conquered by a Word or a Thought, We are beginning the War ** Tail foremost.'' I will not plead 
guilty to this charge, but acknowledge I said ** We 
begin at the wrong end.'' Instead of repenting or 
apologizing I almost wish I had used and avowed an 
expression more in the stile of Rabelais and Swift, 
which would have been propagated to the ends of the 
earth : for Mankind are sure to remember expressions 
of vulgar Buffoonery and to forget everything else. 
This sublime and profound expression shall remain 
blank * * * * deest valde desideratum. 

I sometimes meet an old grey headed Man, with 
trembling Tongue and Limbs and shaking quavering 
voice, whose countenance lights up at the sight of me, 
and says '' Do you remember the time in our Revolutionary War when I met you, and said to you, What 
shall we do? Things look so dark I am in despair. 
You answered me quick, Never fear! We shall 
BLUNDER THROUGH !" This was indeed my constant 
Maxim through the whole Revolution. That we did 
blunder, through the whole, both in Congress and in 
the Army is most certain. That we blundered through 
cannot now be denied. I wish H. had written his history' 
of Ws. Battles and Campains ! You or I could write 
the Blunders in Congress. 

The Word " Peace'' according to your Postscript has 
done great Things. But do you know how our Federalists account for the fondness of the Southern States 
including Pensilvania for War? They say **Your 
Commerce is free, but ours is ruined by the War, and 
you hate us so heartily that you rejoice in any thing 
that can destroy us.'* There is in truth a rancorous 
Malignity in Pensilvania against New England. 

My Friend Gray, who made me a visit yesterday, is 
sanguine, is confident, that Congress, as soon as they 
meet, will order thirty Frigates to be built as soon as 
possible. When I see this vote, I shall think Common 
Sense is resuming its Empire, and Astraea returning to 
the World. If a solid Peace, equal Commerce, and 
common Justice, are ever to return, even for a period 
of any duration, the U. S. must restore them. The 
litde young shepherd with his sling must get the better 
of the great Goliah. 

Achilles, offended at the seizure of his virgin, has retired to his ships. The Greeks are no longer a match 
for Priam and his sons Hector and iEneas. Do you 
understand the figure? I believe not. I must then be 
Commentator. Achilles is New Engrland : his Girl is a 
Navy. There is no Patroclus, whose deatii would bring 
the Hero out. Agamemnon must restore the Beauty. 

The wine which Saint Paul found so good for the 
stomack is not less delightful to the Ladies. Oh ! how 
they love it. I foresee it is not to be long lived. It 
will not be permitted to meliorate or pejorate by age. 
So much the more grateful ought we all to be for the 
blessing. 

I close by an earnest exhortation, to all Friends of 
our Country to cry aloud and spare not, for an irresistable naval power on the Lakes and water communications from Michillimachinae to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'><a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a></a>. 

Without this nothing but defeat, disgrace, distraction 
and Ruin will be our portion, besides endless Murders, 
Massacres and Butcheries by the Indians on all our 
Frontier. If ever the English are again suffered to 
have a superiority on those waters, I shall think my 
Countrymen the stupidest of all Nations. I would not 
disdain to borrow the finest flight of Fisher Ames's imagination and call upon every Father and every Mother 
in every Log house upon the Continent to demand a 
Navy on the Lakes to protect the blood of their sons 
and Daughters. 

I am as ever your obliged Friend

My dear Doctor in Law, Divinity, Pouticks, Medicine, AND Surgery &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c., — I am in great perplexity. Every day, something occurs to puzzle my 
feeble Intellect. To whom can I apply for instruction 
so properly as to you, who are so great a Master. 

A nation of Bees, in the Wilderness in a State of 
Nature, has sagacity enough to wander about till they 
find a hollow Tree, in which they can be screened and 
sheltered, both from the scorching beams of the sun in 
Summer, which would melt their wax and drown them 
in their own honey : and from the fierce Winds and 
sharp Frosts of Winter which might scatter, divide and 
blow them away, or freeze them to death in half an 
hour, in one heap. They thus protect themselves too 
from the King Birds, and from inimical neibouring 
Nations of the same Species with themselves, perhaps 
from the parent Hive or from a sister Hive, older or 
younger. When they have thus prepared and accomplished their system of national defence, they turn their 
attention to their internal and domestic policy. What 
public order ! What mathematical accuracy ! What 
security of private property ! What Industry ! What 
Enterprize ! And to crown all, what inexorable Justice, 
in banishing all the idle banking drones, who in idleness 
and luxury fatten on the pillage of industrious Bees ! 

A Nation of Ants, will look forward into Futurit}', 
and spare no labour or expence in raising a mountain 
in comparison with their own size and stature, higher 
than Wachusett, Allegany or the Andes, to defend 
themselves and families from the predatory Birds and 
Insects and to shelter them from Storms and snows and 
frosts. With indefatigable Toil, with incessant labour 
through the whole summer, will they replenish their Magazines with Provisions and Comforts, upon speculation 
against the Winter. 

A Wood Pecker, from a prognostication of dangers 
from storms and ennemies, will almost break her neck 
and wear out her Bill in pecking a vault in a Tree, for 
the safety of herself her eggs and her young ones. 

A Swallow seeks a barn and a Martin a Chimney, 
from a foresight of Danger from Birds of Prey, from 
rats and mice, as well as from winds and storms. 

The Squirrills have penetration into futurity. They 
seek an assylum in Hollow Trees, in caves of the rocks, 
in Crevices in stone walls, and hoard up magazines of 
Provisions in Nutts against Winter, when they know 
they cannot steal com" from the fields or Cribbs of any 
of the neighbouring Farmers. 

The wild Geese speculate into futurit)': so do the 
Brants and Ducks. They foresee storms and Winter 
and take great care in season to fly to the Southward 
in Autumn. In Spring they foresee scalding heats of 
summer approaching and have the wisdom to return to 
the Northward to avoid them. 

The Swine foreseeing Rain will run about and labour 
hard though ever so fat, heavy and lazy to gather and 
collect straws and husks to make diem a warm and dry 
bed to sleep in. 

There is a Bugg : have you ever observed him ? He 
will labour like an Ant or a Bee, to collect a certain 
species of Matter, and to roll it up into a Ball. He 
will round, smooth, and polish it into a Globe as perfecdy spherical as DeMoivre or Sir Isaac could do it, 
till it is ten times more bulky than himself. It is truly admirable to see with what dexterity activity and strenuous exertion, he will toil to roll it over and over till he 
stores it away in his Cave for his Winters Nourishment 
and Sustenance. This provident, speculating litde Animal goes by a Name that Doctor Swift would not hesitate 
to write at full length. But as it would offend Dr. 
Rushes delicacy it shall not pollute my page. I may say 
it begins with the two syllables Tumble. 

I lately read in a national Intelligencer, to my great 
edification a learned and ingenious address to the People 
signed by a Committee of half a dozen or half a score 
Democrats of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, among whom the notable 
Mr. Binns, the associate of McCorkle, is one. 

Part of the address seems to be intended as a Justification, it is more than an Apology, for our Want of 
Preparation for War by Land and Sea and our consequent Defeats and disappointments. And it gravely 
and solemnly asserts that ** a Republican Government, 
or a Democratical Government, cannot make Preparations for War, upon speculation.'' 

Now this is my Puzzle. I dare not apply my carnal 
Reason to this Doctrine and inferr from it, that the 
Democrats of Pensilvania have less sense than the wild 
Geese, the swallows, or the Tumble 

What then shall I think ? The first Man if he had 
been created in the woods among wild Beasts, if he 
knew their carnivorous Nature would arm himself 
against them with stones and Clubbs. 

Si velis Pacem para Bellum is as old as the Latin 
Tongue. But if the wisdom of all ages and Nations 
had declared against it, the authority of Divus Washington, one would think, would be sufficient to overrule 
it all, with these People. 
Our country exhibits, a spectaculum dignum ! If the 
enterprise at Queenstown was as imprudent as that at 
Louisburg in 1745 or that of Bunkers Hill in 1775, it 
was as bravely fought as either. 

I stand astonished at the sight of our Country ! If 
effectual Measures are not soon taken for a Navy on 
the Lakes and a Navy on the Ocean, it will fly to Pieces 
like a Glass Bubble. 

I feel for the Government however: well knowing 

by costly experience, that Binn*s Apology is too well 

founded in this Nation. 

your anxious friend 

<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">John Adams</a>.

The passage referred to in this Letter is in an address **To the democratic Republicans of Pensilvania," 
signed by John Holgate, John Binns, John Geyer and 
John Porter, Oct. 12. 1812. 

"While our national Government preserves its Republican form and spirit, there can be no accumulation 
of Treasure, no enlistment of Armies, no equipment 
of Navies, in the time of Peace, upon the speculation 
of War: and it is, perhaps, the concomitant inconvenience of the inestimable blessings of such a Government, that its Wars will always commence in a state 
comparatively unprepared for the supply, as well as for 
the discipline of its public Force/'

Dear Sir, — I have reed, your valuable volume, on 
the diseases of the mind, which will run Mankind still 
deeper into your Debt. You apprehend ** Attacks.*' 

I say, the more the better. I should like the sport so 
well, that, if I could afford the expence, I would advertise a reward of a gold Medal to the Man of Science, 
who should write the best essay upon the question 
whether the Writings of Dr. Franklin or Dr. Rush do 
the greatest honour to America, or the greatest good 
to Mankind. I have no doubt, but such a point mooted, 
would produce a salutary Controversy. You would 
not have been so industrious nor so useful, if you had 
not been persecuted. These afflictions are but for a 
moment and they work out greater Glory. 

Dream for Dream. When it was proposed to institute a Democracy in France, I dreamed that I was 
mounted on a lofty scaffold in the Centre of a great 
plain in Versailles, surrounded by an innumerable congregation of five and twenty Millions at least of the 
Inhabitants of the Royal Menagerie. Such a multitude 
is not to be described or enumerated in detail. There 
were among them the elephant. Rhinoceros, the Lion, 
the Hyaena, the Wolf, the Bear, the Fox, and the Wild 
Cat, the Rat, the Squirrel, as well as the Calf, the 
Lamb, and the Hare. There were Eagles, Hawks, and 
Owls of all sorts and storks and Cormorants and Crows, 
and Ducks, Geese, Turkies, Partridges, Quails, Robbins, Doves and Sparrows. There were Whales, 
Sharks, Dolphins, as well as Cod, Mackerel, Herrings 
and even Minims and shiners. 

My design was to persuade them to associate under 
a free soverign Annimatical Government, upon the 
unadulterated Principles Liberty, Equality and Fraternity, among all living Creatures. I had studied a long 
speech, arranged it in exact Method, with a Beginning, 
a middle and an end, with an exordium and a very 
padiedc Peroradon, according to die most orthodox 
rules of the most approved Rhetoricians. Throwing 
my eyes round and gracefully bowing to my respectable audience, I began 

My beloved Brothers ! We are all Children of the 
same Father, who feeds and cloaths us alL Why 
should we not respect each others rights and live in 
peace and mutual Love ? 

I had not pronounced all these words, before the 
elephant pouted his Probosis at me in contempt, the 
Lion roared, the Wolf howled, the Cats and Dogs were 
by the ears, the Eagles flew upon the Turkies, the 
Hawks and Owls upon the Chickens and Pidgeons. 
The Whale rolled to swallow twenty at a mouthful, and 
the Shark turned on his side to snap the first he could 
reach with his adamandne Teeth. In a word such a 
scene of Carnage ensued as no eye had ever seen, and 
no Pen or Pencil ever described. Frightened out of my 
Witts, I leaped from the stage and made my escape : 
not however without having all my Cloaths torn from 
my back and my skin lacerated from head to foot. The 
terror and the scratches awakened me and convinced 
me forever, what a Fool I had been. 

The quesdon concerning Canada is so great and 
complicated with so many considerations present and 
future, that I do not like to form any setded opinion 
upon it : — knowing that the result must be uncertain I 
leave it to the Counsels of the Nadon, acquiescing in 
whatever they may determine. Of one Thing I am 
certain that a decided superiority of Force upon the 
Lakes will henceforward be indispensable for us, or a 
sdpuladon that neither Nadon shall have any. It was 
easy to foresee at the Peace of 1 783, that as long as 
neither Party should have any military Power upon 
those waters, none would be necessary, but as soon as 
one should begin the other must follow. This necessity will now excite an emulation, that will cost us as 
much to maintain, perhaps as it will to conquer the 
Province, when no Artillery will be wanted so far from 
the Ocean. 

The Christian Religion was intended to give Peace 
of Mind to its Disciples in all cases whatsoever : but not 
to send civil or political Peace upon earth but a sword, 
and a sword it has sent : and peace of Mind too to Millions, by conquering death and taking away his sting. 

Anecdote for Anecdote. I recollect to have heard 
in 1774, the sagacious Prediction of Isaac Norris of 
Fair Hill : and I well remember another of another 
sachem of equal Reflection and Penetration. 

Colonel James Otis, the sire of all the Otis's you 
have ever seen or heard, told me, that in 1758 in company with many Members of our Provincial Legislature, when the conversation turned upon the expedition against <a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, John Choate of Ipswitch a  Colonel of Militia and Member of the House said ** The Army 
was gone against <a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a>k, but he hoped they would 
never take it.** The whole Company cried out in astonishment, " What do you mean ? No Man has been 
more active in forwarding every measure to promote 
the Enterprize, and now not wish it success ! What 
can have got into your head ?'* " It is true I have done 
every Thing to give a Check to the French Power: 
but as soon as the English conquer Canada, they will 
take hold of us, and handle us worse than the French 
and Indians ever did or ever can.'* Two years had not 
passed before the British Cabinet ordered Charles Paxton and his Sub. Cockle to apply for Writts of Assistants to break open Houses, Cellars, Ships, Shops and 
Casks to search for uncustomed Goods. 

Our English Cousins, by Adam and Eve, may laugh 
at our uneducated sages and Heroes : but what then ? 
His forecast was as sure and his Bravery; as great and 
his education as Classical for any thing that I know as 
the Duke of Marlborough's. He was one of our Massachusetts Colonels who conquered Cape Breton in 
1745. You may judge of his Modesty as well as of 
his Taste by an Inscription on a Bridge which he built 
and I have often read, when I rode Circuits and attended Courts at Ipswitch. 

I always hear the name of George Clymer with pleasure, and am happy that he still thinks with us. 

I congratulate you upon the certain prospect of the 
reelection of Mr. Madison. I have nothing to say, because I know nothing, against Mr. Clinton. I read 
Panegyricks upon him and Phillipicks against him : but 
these are the common lot of all Candidates. His election at this time would have produced such an unnatural confusion of administration and opposition as would 
have been very dangerous. I am grieved and ashamed 
at the Apostacy of so many People in our Northern 
States. But the French Revolution, its Anarchy first 
and its military Despotism at last, have frightened them 
out of their habitual cool good sense. 

I am once and forever yours

Dear Sir, — On horseback, on my way to Weymouth 
on a visit to my Friend Dr. Tufts I met a Man leading 
a Horse, who asked if I wanted to buy a Horse. Examining the Animal in his eyes, ears, head, Neck, 
shoulders, Legs, Feet and Tail, and enquiring of his 
Master his age, history. Temper habits &amp;c. I found he 
was a colt of three years old that month of November, 
his sucking Teeth were not shed, he was seventeen or 
eighteen hands high, bones like massy timbers, ribbed 
quite to his Hipps, every Way broad strong and well 
filled in Proportion : as tame, gende, good natured and 
good humoured as a Cosset Lamb. Thinks I to myself. This noble Creature is the exact Emblem of my 
dear Country. I will have him and call him my hobby. 
He may carry me, five and twenty or thirty years if I 
should live. I ride him every day when the weather suits : 
but I should shudder, if he should ever discover or feel 
his own Power. By one vigorous exertion of his strength, 
he might shake me to the ground, on the right hand or 
the left, pitch me over his head, or throw me back over 
his rump. In either case, I might get scratches or bruises 
which you know are not easily healed at my age. 

One day after a long ride upon Hobby I came home, 
well exercised, in good health, and gay spirits, went to 
bed, fell asleep, and dreamed. 

An open Theatre was erected in the Centre of a 
vast plain in Virginia, where were assembled all the 
Inhabitants of U. S. eight millions of People, to sec 
a new Play, advertised as the most extraordinary that 
ever was represented on any Stage, excelling Menander 
Terence, Shakespeare, Corneille and Moli^re. 
I shall not give you the Dramatis Personae at length : 
but Garrick, Mrs. Siddons and Cook were conspicuous 
among a Company proportionally excellent I shall 
not give you the play, because I should have to compose one : and you must be sensible, that I have small 
pretensions to the Genius of Euripides and Racine. I 
shall only give you a hint of a part of one scene. 

A distant View of the Ocean was presented with 
Hull and his Constitution blazing away his horrizontal 
volcano of a broadside at the Guerri^re, which is soon 
seen to explode : after the explosion, the Constitution 
sails majestically but slowly along the whole length of 
the Theatre and comes to anchor, in full sight of the 
Audience : then Jones with his Frolick succeeded and 
anchored near the Constitution and it was remarkable 
that the audience applauded him with as much enthusiasm as Hull. Next came Decatur in The United States 
followed by The Macedonian, and anchored in their 
order, in fair sight of the whole Nation. After a pause 
for the spectators to gaze and admire, Mrs. Siddons 
was selected to address the audience. Slowly and 
gracefully swimming over the stage she approached 
near enough to be beared by all, with all the advantages 
of her Face, Figure, Gestures and intonations, pointing 
with her hand to the glorious spectacle of the Navy, in 
the words of Adam to Eve when she first saw her face 
in the clear stream, she only said 

** America I This, fair Creature, is th}*self!'* 

*• Sampson ! There, is thy Lock of divine Power !" 

" Hercules ! Behold the emblem of thy Strength, which is to subdue 

" Monsters and conquer Oppressors." 

" David ! Lo thy sling, which is to bring Goliah to Reason !" 

Observing that this overgrown Colt of a Nation had, 
after all this, no feeling of its strength nor any sense 
of its Glory, any more than my Hobby, I obtained a 
speaking Trumpet, and made a Motion, which was carried, that the Play should be dismissed and The Nation 
resolve itself into a Committee of the whole House on 
the State of the Nation, Dr. Rush in the Chair. It 
was my intention to record the Phizzes of the Tories, 
about one-third : the speeches of the deep Democrats, 
about another Third who abused me so much a dozen 
or fourteen years ago on account of my Navy which is 
now saving them from destruction. 

The Exultations of the remaining third, who had been 
always friendly to naval defence, which indeed after all 
amounted to little more than " Did we not always tell 
you so?" 

The sensations and Reflections of Jefferson, Madison, 
Giles &amp;c. as well as their orations you may imagine. 
Jay King Morris and DeWitt spoke at length. McKean 
Clymer &amp;c. spoke from Pensilvania. Cheves and 
Lounds from S. C. Pope and Clay from Kentucky. 

I shall give a sketch only of the speech of John 
Randolph, and that only on a separate Piece of Paper 
which I conjure you by our Friendship to burn, tlie moment you have read it, for it is fit only to be seen by 
your eye. Nimrod Hughes and Christopher Macpherson spoke next after John Randolph. The vote was 
called and a small Majority, heavily and languidly appeared for a few 74s and twent)' Frigates. 

Oh ! The Wisdom ! The Foresight and the Hindsight, the rightsight and the Leftsight! The Northsight and the Southsight, the Eastsight and the Westsight, that appeared in that august assembly! Many 
Quaker women. Dr. Dwight and Dr. Esgood spoke. 
and had Joel been there no doubt he would have delivered an epic Poem. 

So much Business could not be done in a short time. 
The sun now blazed through the Windows upon my 
eyes and awoke me. 

Vive la Bagatelle. Dulce est desipere. 

In my dream Porter and his Alert, Chauncey and his 
Flotilla on the Lake were not forgotten, they were all 
at anchor with the Frigates : but in reducing the Thing 
to writing in the morning, in haste I inadvertently 
omitted them. The History of the Hobby Horse is 
litteral Truth.

Dr. Sir, — Never! Never be weary in the ways of well dreaming ! Any one of your Dreams is worth to the Moralist and the Statesman any Fable of Esop or 
Phedrus, La Fontaigne, More or Gay. And why should your ancient wisdom deny itself the relaxation of a little folsttre, Gayety, when it gives so much pleasure to your 
Friends, hurts the feelings of nobody, and communicates useful Instruction to all. My dream of an Animalical Constitution, had no squint at the American Republick. 
De Republica Gallicana narrabatur, or narrata fuit : I am not critick enough in the Language to determine which tense, is the most grammatical, or conformable to statuary Modesty. 

There is a Gentleman here, more unfortunate than 
you are, from the same Causes. I assure you my sensibilities are rent and torne for him. Such another Instance of persevering and overwhelming Persecution 
of Merit, I have never yet known in America. Dr. 
Waterhouse I mean. Can nothing be done to save an 
amiable Family and a Man of first rate Merit from oppression, from becoming a sacrifice to Tory Vengeance, 
and professional envy ? 

Your curious fact, as you observe, is not singular. 
My Case is like yours. *' Those who owe me most 
obligations are the most hostile to me.*' The Essex 
Junto owe their existence and all their Consequence to 
me. They adopted my sentiments and plan of Government in 1 779 and in 1788, and availed themselves of 
my writings and my Influence and of my Patronage, to 
lay the foundation of all that Power which they are now 
abusing to the danger of the Nation. Of all our Revolutionary Colleagues and Coadjutors I was invariably 
the most tender, the most compassionate the most indulgent to the Tories, as I could exemplify to you in a 
hundred Instances which would fill a volume. This 
Conduct was dictated to me, not only by Humanity and 
Candour, but by a desire to unite the American People, 
who, you know, were divided in their hearts, as much as 
they are now, through the whole Revolution. 

You have given me more pleasure than you can 
conceive, by your account of your Independence and 
Affluence. But I can by no means unite with your excellent Lady in her advice. Your Pupils will lose by 
your Retirement advantages both in reputation and instruction of greater value to their future Lives, than 
your Modesty or their Inexperience can now estimate. 
Your Patients will lose what no young Physician can 
supply : perhaps no old one. Your son James will be 
established in practice under your protecting wing, 
sooner than without you. Your own health will be 
better preserved by a continuance in your established 
habits of thinking and acting, of studies and exercises, 
than by the great and sudden Changes they must 
undergo in a Country retirement. Your Daughters 
Husband must do his dut)' and we must all be resigned to his fate, whether prosperous or adverse. He 
will be, I doubt not a generous enemy and I hope 
and believe that he will meet with none but generous 
enemies. 

Our Xaval Victories will mark an Era in the History 
of the World. Thev have revealed to Mankind two 
most important Truths, which, tho' I have believed them 
these fort)' years, few other Men ever suspected and 
fewer still would believe, viz. 

1. That the British Xavv is vulnerable, and 

2. That the American Na\y is the only one able to 
check and limit its Power. 

What effects will the splendid and immortal examples 
of our American Xaval Conquerors have upon the 
Minds of the French, the Dutch, the Russian, the Spanish, the Danish, the Swedish and the Portuguese officers 
and Men ? The effect upon British officers is obvious. 
Instead of seeking us. as they do all other Nations, they 
run away. 

My mind is however not at ease. The Disgrace 
upon disgrace the disasters following disasters which 
have attended our officers and troops upon the Inland 
waters: the disposition manifested by the Southern 
States, during the first twelve years to weaken the 
Government and embarrass all its operations : too faithfully imitated by the Northern States, during the twelve 
last : appear to tend towards a general dissolution. 
Comfort me if you can. My hopes are all in a Navy. 

Adieu.

Dr. Sir, — I have not done with your Letter of the 
19th. I care not half so much about Red Heiffer, as I 
do about The Taureau Wane, the White Bull of Voltaire. "All volition the effect of his will, operating 
upon Mind." My pious learned Parson Wibirt, once 
said to me ** I believe God is the Author of Sin : but I 
would not say it, because of the dangerous tendency 
of it." My Friend ! read in Virgil, Jupiters acknowledgment that though Fate had given him the command 
of Gods and Men, yet he and the whole universe, were 
only instruments of Fate. Read Edwards, read Priestley, read Jaques le Fataliste et son Maitre, and after 
all ask yourself whether you have not a Conscience, 
that still tells you, that you have sometimes done wrong, 
and sometimes right. There is not now, never was, 
and never will be more than one Being, who will understand the universe. Sixty years have I puzzled myself, with Clark and Leibnitz and Baxter &amp;c. to no 
purpose. I know no more now than I did at 1 7 years 
of age. 

Hunc solem et Stellas et decedentia certis 
Tempora momentis, sunt qui formidine nulla 
Imbuti spectent. 
Let us descend to earth where it is our duty to crawl. 
You must know that I have the honor to be President 
of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, of the 
Massachusetts Society for promoting Agriculture, and 
of the Board of Trustees of this Society and of the 
board of visitors of the Professorship of Natural History at the University. There are twelve of us of 
these boards. We meet once a Month, on the last Saturday at each others houses at our own expense. 
Every one, but myself, is a stanch Anti-Jeffersonian 
and Anti-Madisonian, and at the late election, Clintonian. These are all real Gentlemen : all but me very 
rich : have their City Palaces and Country Seats, their 
fine Gardens and greenhouses and hot houses &amp;c. &amp;c. 
&amp;c. Men of Science, Letters and Urbanity, even 
Spartacus, out of a Newspaper, or a Pamphlet, is all 
this. 

On the last Saturday of October at Mr. Pomroys of 
Brighton, the Gentlemen were in good spirits and indulged in a little political Conversation, the detail of 
which would be too long. I had not agreed to the 
selection of Mr. Clinton,* though I should acquiesce, if 
he should be chosen. 

Spartacus the Slave ! Spartacus the Rebel ! Spartacus the Rebel Slave ! Spartacus the Rebel Leader 
of Rebel Slaves ! asked me with an air of candour. What 
Course I would have pursued, had I been continued 
President to this time? I said that must have depended on Congress. The Gentlemen expressed a 
wish to know my single opinion of the best plan. I 
said the time would fail me to give details, but I could 
give in short hand, a sketch of a few principal strokes. 
The Gentlemen wished to hear them. I said, I would 

not have repealed the taxes: no, not a shilling of 
them. With that Revenue I would have fortified the 
Frontiers on the Lakes and Rivers as well as on the 
Ocean. I would have gradually increased the Navy, 
by additional ships every year that we might be in a 
condition to meet the mighty Mistress of the Ocean on 
her own element, and convince her that she is not all 
powerful there. I would have declared war against 
Great Britain five or six years ago when the King 
issued that most atrocious of all violations of the Law 
of Nations, his Proclamation for impressing seamen 
from our ships. I would not have said a word about 
Canada : but would have employed all our resources at 
sea. If the war had continued for years and the Nation 
become hot enough to demand Canada, I would not 
have invaded it till we had a decided supremacy of 
Naval Power upon all the Lakes and waters from

Honoured and learned Sir, — Be pleased to accept 
my humble Duty for the notice you have condescended 
to take of me. I will do my best to shake a little animation into my Master for a few days or months or 
possibly years. But what is the prospect before him ? 
What can he expect? or hope? or wish? He is *]*] 
and more: three and twenty years will make him 100: 
thirteen years will make him 90 : three years will bring 
him to fourscore. And what are three, thirteen, or three 
and twenty years, at any stage of Life, m Infancy, Manhood or old age ? especially in extream old age ? How 
many Pains and Aches, which I cannot shake away, has 
he to endure? How much low spirits? how many 
gloomy anxious moments for the dangers, disgraces, 
disasters, degeneracy, vices, Follies, Ignorance, Stupidity, 
and Vanity of his Country ? How many Wives, Daughters, Sons, Grand Children, Brothers, Cousins may he 
lose in 23, 13 or 3 years? How many of the few remaining public political Friends must disappear ? Even 
Dr. Rush himself? Oh ! if he were to read this he 
would shed many Tears ! Pray conceal it from him ! 
But there are other things. How much Ecclesiastical 
Bigottry superstition and Persecution may he have to bewail? How much Calumny, Intrigue, Party spirit, 
political Fury and civil war may he have to deplore ? 
I will leave the rest sir, to your profound Reflections. 
I will only compare the foregoing periods with some 
of his past Life. Fifteen years he spent at schools, 
Male and female Grammar and A. B. C. When he 
played Truant, and when he did not he spent all his 
mornings Noons and Nights in making and sailing Boats, 
in swimming, skaiting, flying kites and shooting in marbles. Ninepins, Bat and Ball, Football &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Quoits 
Wrestling and sometimes Boxing &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and what 
was no better running about to Quiltings and Huskings and Frolicks and Dances among the Boys and 
Girls ! ! ! These 1 5 years went off* like a Fairy Tale. 
Apply such a 1 5 years to his present age and it will 
make 93. 

He then spent 4 years at Collidge. He had begun 
to love a Book. Farewell shooting skaiting swimming 
and all the rest. Oh ! the Mathematicks the Metaphysicks, the Logick not forgetting Classicks ! Seeking 
Books and Bookish Boys, devouring Books without 
advice and without Judgement. The 4 years were gone 
like a tale that is told. Add such a 4 years to his present 
age and it will make him 81. 

He then passed 3 years at Worcester, among black 
Letter French and Latin Law and kept a school to pay 
for the priviledge. The 3 years were gone seemingly 
in the twinkling of an eye. Add such a three years to 
his present age and it will make him 80. He then removed to <a href='/results.php?city=braintree' rel='city'>Braintree</a> County of Suffolk in Massachusetts, 
where he spent 17 years at the Bar, riding Circuits, 
getting Money and a Wife and Children. But the 17 
years flew away like the Morning Cloud. Add 1 7 such 
years and you will make him 90. Four years were then 
spent in Congress, you know how. But they Ayere gone 
like a dream. Add 4 such years to his present age and 
you make him 81. Then he was ten years in Europe : 
on the Mountain, Wave, over the Hills and far away. 
But the 10 years were gone he scarcely knew how. 
Add 10 such and they will make him 87. He had then 
an Interval of eight or nine months. Then he was 8 
years V. President : a Target for the Archers : a Constant object of the Bilingsgate, scurrility, Misapprehensions, Misconstructions, Misrepresentations, Lies and 
Libels of all Parties. These 8 went away like a nauseous Fog. Add such an 8 to his age and you make 
him 85. He was then President for 4 years. A Tale 
told by an Idiot full of sound and fury signifying 
Nothing. Vanity of Vanities all was Vanity! Add 
such a four years and you would infallibly kill him long 
before he would be 81. Twelve years have passed in 
solitude, far the pleasantest of ail : yet where are they ? 
gone like the Dew, the blossoms, the Flowers and the 
Leaves. Add such another 1 2 and you make him 89 : 
withered, ^ded, wrinkled, tottering, trembling, stumbling, sighing, groaning, weeping ! Oh ! I have some 
scruples of Conscience, whether I ought to preserve 
him : whether it would not be Charit)' to stumble, and 
relieve him from such a futurity'. 

Add only 24 such years as have passed since his return from Europe to America and you make him loi, 
an object of wonder and of Pit)', to a gaping, staring 
World ! 

And now my venerable, learned^ philosophical religious virtuous excellent sir, permit me to ask whether 
this axidress is not as monitory a moral essay as any in Johnsons Rambler or his Prince of Abyssinia ? Remember too it is a Horse that asks the question, and 
that Horse is Hobby.

Dear Sir, — You have enough of Smiths Letters e'er 
this and Waterhouses too : all which you will be so good 
as to return. What the consequence of Smiths election may be I know not. I anticipate no advantage to 
him, but he will either correct the Policy and War of 
the Administration, in some degree, or he will ruin it, 
and himself with it, most probably. 

Manleys Ship was not a " private Ship of War." It 
was a public National Ship, under a national Flagg, 
under the Authority and in obedience to the Command 
of Congress, then the Sovereign of the Nation. She 
was fitted out by General Washington, at the public expence by order of that Assembly in which was vested 
and concentrated the Supream, Sovereign and absolute 
Authority and Power of the Nation : an authority more 
absolute and Power more decisive at that time and the 
next year, than has ever been possessed since by any 
legislative and Executive Body in the United States. 

The next year, 1776 Captain Talbot was fitted out, 
in other ships from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, by General Washington 
at the public expence by virtue of the same Powers, 
and in obedience to the same orders of Congress, and 
took more ships, made more Prisoners, and captured 
more property, than Jones and Barry both ever did in 
their lives. I was about to indulge my vexation in a 
peevish paragraph. But I will put it on a separate 
Paper which I enjoin you to burn. 
Our Brother Clymer is pretty severe upon us. But 
whose Flour, Tobacco and Cotton " makes honour kick 
the Beam ?" I hope the Penetent Saint will be forgiven 
his Anti Novangliasm ! But that is a Prejudice, a Distemper of the Mind, a contagious one too : with which 
The Quakers, The Irish, and the Scotch and the whole 
Body of Presbyterians have infected the soul of every 
Man, Woman and Child in Pensilvania : your own pure, 
philosophical and Christian Soul not excepted. 

As to perpetual motion, I will give you my opinion. 
When it shall repent the Almighty, and it shall grieve 
him to the heart that he has made the material, intellectual and social universe : determine to return to his 
eternal solitude : annihilate the whole Creation except 
one 24 Pounder well loaded, one Man to fire it and air 
enough to discharge it : and when that one Man shall 
discharge his 24 Pound Ball that Ball will move to all 
eternity in a right Line : unless the Man, Gun and Ball 
should be annihilated too. Then and not till then will 
perpetual Motion of Matter stirred by matter be discovered. 

Having prognosticated the time and manner of the 
Invention and discovery of perpetual Motion, I will now 
give you the Pedigree of Redheffer. He is descended 
from the White Bull into which Nebuchadnezzar was 
metamorphosed. That was a beautiful Bull. All the 
Heiffers black, blue, white, brown, brindled and red 
loved him. The <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> Inventor of perpetual 
motion is descended from the red. 

A Pin, or a Pun is honour enough for the Invention 
and the Inventor. Why did he not demand a Patent ? 
Dr. Thornton would have detected and exposed him. 

But to return to sober sense. Your Character of 

The Hon. William Jones Esquire, the new Secretar&gt;' of 
the Navy, gives me great and sincere pleasure. I shall 
probably have occasion to write to him on several occasions: for I am determined not to be bashfull in 
recommending Men of Merit whom I know, but in 
whom I have no personal Interest. Upon this Principle I shall write in behalf of Dr. Waterhouse : and I 
pray you to write to Secretary Smith and pray him to 
have Dr. Waterhouse on his Mind and give a candid 
and impartial attention to such Recommendations as 
may be sent him. 

As to your Book, you must give it and all your other 
Writings, as Lord Bacon did " to your Country after a 
few Generations are overpas'd." No early and active 
Agent in the revolution ever was or will be forgiven, till 
all the early and active enemies of it and their Children 
and Disciples are dead, if then. I always knew it and 
expected it. 

Our Seamen continue to act like themselves : but I can 

never cease to lament the twelve years neglect of them. 

I am ever

Dear Sir, — I congratulate you, and your State and 
our Nation on the acquisition of such a Secretary of 
the Navy as you represent The Honourable William 
Jones to be. I shall certainly write him a Letter before 
long : for I am recommender General of Midshipmen 
and Pursers and Ensigns. I have not dared as yet to 
rise to a Lieutenant in Navy or Army. Talk not of 
Dignity. Nothing can be more ridiculous and contemptible than the dig^it&gt;' of a President or a Governor, whom every Puppy in the Streets, and every profligate scribbler in a prostituted Newspaper can call a 
Cheat, a Lyar, a Scoundrel, a Villain, a Knave and an 
Impostor when he pleases with Impunity. However 

I hope Pensilvania will no longer complain that they 
have not their share of Power. You have the Secretary of the Treasury : the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy and the Controuler of the Treasury, 
and I presume will soon have The Surgeon and Physician General of the Army. And how many Officers 
of the Navy and Army ? Do you not see that Pensilvania is to be pitted against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ? And who can 
blame it? 

I know your prudence too well, not to know that you 
will not answer these questions : and I approve of that 
Prudence. 

Feathers and Straws shew which Way the Wind 
blows. Such Beings as Jones and Barry sett up Pretensions ! And such Pretensions are abetted and trumpetted by State Pride ! 

I inclose you a Letter from Governor Langdon which 
you will be so good as to return to me, as you have 
those of Smith and Waterhouse by the next Post 

Have you read Waterhouses Botanist? His independent Whig? or any other of his Writings? How 
these Things all go by Nation, by soil, by Climate, by 
Country, by State, by Cit\'. by Part}* ! Let me illustrate by a familiar example. Had you been born in 
Scotland, composed and published your medical works 
there, and all your other Writings, mutatis mutandis, 
you would have been trumpeted throughout all Europe 
and celebrated in all Languages as a greater Man than 
Sir John Sinclair, or Walter Scott or Burns the other 
Poet: nay as a more usefuU Author than Hume or 
Robertson. Had Waterhouse been born, educated, 
studied, wrote and published in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, he would 
have been a Rival of Dr. Rush. 

Six, of the remaining nine, subscribers of the declaration of Independence will soon take their flight after 
Clymer. Jefferson, Gerry and Rush, have yet probably a longer run. Jefferson is as tough as a lignum 
vitae knot. He rides Journeys on Horseback. I have 
within a few days a Letter from him, a very obliging 
one, written with all the precision of his best years. 
Not one symptom of decay or decline can I discern in it. 

Adieu.

Mv DEAR Phiix/Sopher, — Youf Exhortation to Punctuallit\' and vour Tic douloureuse had scarcely been read 
to my Family before a Lady Mrs. Quinc\- came in and 
took them awav. This Ladv, one of the best and 
wisest, had a Relation Mrs. Sturgis afflicted with this 
tormenting Tic, to whom she carried your Pamphlet, 
who has circulated it in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, till I am told ever&gt;' 
Physician in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> has read it I haye heard of two 
other Cases, Mrs. Crofts an old Lady and Miss Elizabeth Smith a young one haye something yer\' like it, 
and haye had the Benefit of your Friendship in sending 
this yaluable Publication to me. 

You Physicians are growing so familiar \i"ith Hemlock, and Arsenick, and Mercur}* Sublimate, and Laudanum, and Brandy and eyerv Thincr that used to 
frighten me, that I know not what you will do with us. 

For my Part I adhere to my old Regimen which I 
learned of Dr. Cadogan and especially Doctor Cheyne 
in my Youth. Milk and \'egetabies, and Air and Exercise, "with a yer}' little animal Food and still less 
spirituous Liquors, will last a Man almost seyent\' fiye 
Years. I am therefore contented without much assistance from your dangerous and scientific modem Discoyeries. I should prescribe Milk and Water instead 
of Hemlock and Arsenick : but you know besL I must confess you have almost annihilated many diseases 
which within my Memory have made great ravages 
among Men. 

Have your warlike <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>ns considered that 
War with Napoleon is War with all Europe? And 
who are to be their Friends ? The English ? Would 
a Flock of Sheep who had been invaded by a Wolf, fly 
to an African Drove of Panthers for Protection ? Have 
they determined the Question, who began first to violate Neutral Rights? and who has done tlie most mischief in Europe, Asia, Africa and America? But this 
is Politicks which you very rationally and Philosophically and Christianly hate. So do I. — There is one 
Comfort, in the other world, to which I am soon to 
travel, there are No Politicks. 

I rejoice with you in the Happiness of your Children. 
Mine are not so fortunate. They are comfortable However, all but one. I wish Matthew Lion or John Randolph had been sent to Russia. 

With invariable Friendship 

yours

Dear Sir, — I have several sweet letters from you, 
the last of which is of 20th. of this month. 

The Table of Cyder and Health and Poison and 
Death. I have given to Dr. Tuft, who will propagate it 
It is a concise but very comprehensive Result of long 
Experience, attentive observation and deep and close 
Thought 

I was too wise to go to the great Celebration, live 
Heat would have killed me. It was here, as with whu 
The Fashion rules alL 

I remember I spoke on the day the \\&gt;te \va« t;\kon. 
But it was only a Recapitulation of Argimionts which 
had been worn thread bare in die House by fiTijumt 
Repetitions for a long time before. The grtwt (.\&gt;iunw 
versy between Mr. Dickinson and ine» on ihc question 
of Independence, I believe was before yyw came inio 
Congress. I think you did not hear it. It was thri\ 
that I was somewhat ** carried out in spirit*' as rnlhuslastic Preachers sometimes express thcmsolvos. 

You may remember I wrote you twenty years ajfo 
that the Whigs had succeeded too well ever to he lorgiven. 

At the Moment when Independence was declared yon 
know there were full one third of the People who K\rtested it in their hearts, though they dared tiot &lt; (infesq 
it. In Pennsylvania and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> I have nlwayi^ 
thought there was at least one half At the tijnr, I 
believed that these two States would have abandcMied 
Us, if they had not been afraid of the Uni(;n 'a\m\ their 
Neighbours on both sides. 

Among our Secret Enemies, were xwAny old J^amih^'«» 
and very wealthy People, who with their f\fA(A\ut\My\^ 
and connections, were, are and will 1/e Mafer^; of «ll 
who early acted a part in the kevolntion, 'I b'!^;^: h;r/^» 
sometimes had the Government of th/j N'^itK/ri in fh^ir 
hands, as well as many of the i/^rtioilnr ^UU-^. 1 h/ y 
always have and always -ulll ^n^eavMir f// h\?tf^f th^' 
Characters of all, who they tWxr^k h^d ^^rr/ 'a/u/^- ^irrd 
efficient agexicy in the k^r^f^.nuori . 7ry/V' V^^/f^tf ^h 
oblitterate all Gratita&lt;^:e. E&gt;te/!m au\ AH^^n^^t ift rWA 
People towards the really operative Whigs, by lavishing 
an hypocritical adoration on Washington whom they 
have always considered as the mere painted head of 
the Ship. 

I hear and see these Things I believe with as much 
Indifference as you do. My Brother Cranch, to whom 
I shewed your Letter very shrewdly asked me whether 
you did not mean to include me in the list of those 
** most preeminent in the general mental disease. Those 
who by Writing and Reasoning attempt to cure" the 
delirious ? What say you to this ? 

Mr. Marshalls distinction is a great Consolation. 
Success is not in our Power : Fidelity is. And I believe 
his compliment to you was very just. 

Mr. Smiths Pamphlet, like Mr. Randolphs Pamphlet, 

Mr. Monroes Pamphlet, and Mr. Pickerings Pamphlet 

will shout its hour upon the stage, furnish Conversation 

to the idle and the partial for a few days, and then be 

heard no more. It is however scandalous that such 

attacks should be countenanced and encouraged upon 

Presidents whose hands are tied, and cannot defend 

themselves. 

Yours forever

Upon honor, now, Rush ! you cannot be serious in 
callirf^ me mad to my Face. I learned a proper answer to you in Bedlam in England. In one of the 
visits I made to that Hospital, I took a few Turns in 
the Area, where some of the most harmless of the 
patients are permitted to walk. One of them, a decent 
looking Man joined me, and conversed very sensibly 
but with much animation for some time : but prt\sontly 
he began to complain, "He was a much injured Man.*' 
"Great Injustice was done him.** ** He was crurlly 
treated.*' " He was brought here very wron^^fully.** 
** They might with equal Reason have brought \\v.n\ the 
most rational Man in England.** *'Sir, I am as rational 
a Man as ever existed.** This is my first answ<!--r to 
you, Rush. My second is, Nat. Lee, who was mad himself, says somewhere, " there is a pleasure in Ixiing Mad, 
that none but Madmen know.** As you, Rush, at 
present are not mad, however wrong you mayjiave 
been formerly, you cannot at present conceive this sublime pleasure, and you have forgotten what it was. 

You also have forgotten one Phrase, or one member 
of the Period in my old Letter. ** Sacrificed too much/' 
The sentence was "The Whigs have done too mur:h, 
suffered too much, sacrificed too much, and succeeded 
too well, ever to be forgiven." 

However you know there were but two Whi^/** in f he 
Revolution, Franklin and Washingt/^^n. Franklins %i\t'rifices we learn in your account of Richard Ba'.he'^ 
Fortune of 530,000 Dollars : and Wa-->hingt/;n«; &lt;;;irrifices we learn from his will, in which it apj/^rar^ he left 
four or five hundred thou^nd dollars Vf hi^ N&gt;f/h^"^^; 
and from the ¥edf:T^l Civ: v/ -j^'hlrh h^, r^W-A th^- y^hi*: 
of his property and that o: h:^ i^^mWy x tho-i^^od j^er 
cent at an Expenvi to the P/oi:/: of r^or^. tW^u W\^ 
whole Fortune. 

Poor Hancock who im^ on^y^ vorrh Ui^if ^iro^- ; m/zf 
than both of them ttsu r.ot a 7/n /. H^ -^^^^uf ;• f//f n#a^ 
instead of makinr one. 

X)x. Rush ! I request you, or your Son Richard, to 
write a Treatise or at least an Essay, on the Causes of 
the Corruption of Tradition and consequently of the 
Corruption of History. For myself I do believe that 
both Tradition and History are already corrupted in 
America as much as they ever were in the four or five 
first Centuries of Christianity; and as much as they 
ever were in any Age or Country in the whole History 
of Mankind. This is bold and strong, but is it exaggeration ? I know your Prudence, your Reserve, your 
Caution, your Wisdom ; and therefore, as I cannot 
blame you, I have for a long time given up all hope and 
expectation of frank answers to such home Questions. 

I have been severely attacked for too much Candor 
in acquitting Franklin in the affair of the " Secrete de 
Cabinet" and in the affair of Beaumarchais. I met a 
Gentleman in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Streets, a Friend of Franklin if 
ever he had one. He seemed staggered in his Faith. 
Sir, said he, I was conversing with John Coffin Jones 
upon your Character of Franklin. Jones said, "if any 
Man will shew me any possible means by which Franklin could have accumulated such a Property as he left at 
his Death, I will acquit him of the million, the secret of 
the Cabinet etc. But till then I must have suspicions." 
I answered " I believe I could suggest or at least conjecture, Means whereby Franklin might have accumulated that Fortune without Crime or Guilt.** But I had 
no idea of 530,000 Dollars. 

However your account of Lots and Houses in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> and my knowledge and conjectures of other 
Things, may still account for the whole, without the 
supposition of Peculation. 

How shall we account for the selfishness, the avarice, 
the all grasping cupidity of those sublime Gcniu8*!i. 
Boerhaave left a Fortune, as great or greater than 
Franklin or Washington. — And never spent a Doit. 

John Adamh, 

p.S. — Have you received from travelling John Stewart 
In England his Sophiometer ? I am honoured with one, 
in gay Morocco. He is the only Man of Nature that 
ever existed, he says. He is one of your Madmen to be 
sure. He raves against Napoleon, and represents John 
Bull as all natural — i.e. all divine.

Dear Rush, — If I could be considered as a Friend to 
the Family I should advise the Grand Children of Dr* 
Franklin to divide the Real Estate among them in their 
several proportions rather than to sell it in ov\^.t to 
divide the Monev. 

Not a Liver or a Saver wa.^ ever committe/I to T)f. 
Franklin or any other Minister of the United States in 
Europe **to be emoloytd in .Secret Services to hk 
Country.'* The Million of iJvres, that have excited %o 
much speculanoo, were a Part <a t!r,^.="" w="" ^m="" vr="" u^mn&fff="" die="" king="" of="" france="" cr=""> the ^Sr\\tAA States, -/irhich w^f^ 
found wandng in our ''j:^x\<ftr'^ txcira="">&lt;^. who ^id he h^d 
accounted for all he iia^ r*ceiv-^d. Dr. Franklin -^/r^fe 
to the Comte de Ver^enne^ jtx^ the v&gt;M^/*^ ;*nd received for answer that uh;«t \fiili^^ w^&lt;; ' f&gt;e Se^r'^f' dt» 



Mr. ilorns's disov/er/ mo*;*: •&gt;''oh^M7 ■^-^'^ t\o rnOf^ 
dian a suspidon whicii wne y^r^^n ^&gt;r Vo^f' '^/rrn'riMnf 
cated to him. I presume he has no evidence : and that 
none will ever be obtained. Franklin's hands were 
pure as I believe in this Business. 

The Anecdotes of Col. Griffin and Col. Reed ought 
to be published. " Suum cuique Posteritas rependi:'" 
cannot be true unless the Truth is somewhere or other 
recorded by Contemporaries. 

I wish you would try your hand at an enumeration of the Causes of the Corruption both of Tradition and History in our day. 

Your observation on the Characters of the Heroes in the Bible is as profound as it is correct. There is no 
Divus Julius, Divus Augustus or Divus Tiberius in that Book. 

In Massachusetts as in Pensilvania, those who were 
active in the Revolution have died poor. Hancock 
once owned Houses, Lands, Lots and Wharves in the 
Town of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> and landed Estates in allmost all Parts 
of New England which if he had held them to this day 
would be worth more than Washington and Franklin 
were both worth, as I believe. Yet he died, not absolutely but comparatively poor. Cushing S. Adams 
died poor. Paine, J. Adams and Gerry will die poor 
enough, though I hope not insolvent. Lincoln, Knox. 
Brooks, Sullivan, were not rich. The great James Ods 
Junior added nothing to his Property, but sacrificed 
immensely to the Public. 

I hope you will excuse me if I say a few words of 
myself, because you have read in some of our candid

though our Fees in those Times were not so high as 
they are now, and as they were in the Revolutionary 
times when Rum, Sugar and Molasses, Madeira Wine 
and English Goods were given in Profusion to the 
Lawyers, yet I got money as I thought very fast, as 
fast as I desired. This I laid out in a House in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, 
now of great value, in Lands in my own neighbourhood 
in the Country and in the purchase of my brothers 
share of my Fathers Estate, and lent at legal simple 
interest on Bonds and Mortgages to private Persons. 
When our Continental Currency had depreciated four 
or five or six hundred per cent, my Debtors tendered 
to my wife payment of their debts. I advised her to 
receive them and put them into the Loan Office of the 
United States, where they lay sometimes dead and 
sometimes alive till Mr. Gallatin has paid them off, and 
for want of knowing what to do with them I have 
placed very injudiciously I fear. In 17S3 my revered 
Father in Law died and left my wife one half of a 
Patrimonial Farm in Milford near <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, which has 
always produced an handsome rent, and her share of 
his personal Estate. 

In 1803 my wifes Uncle Norton Quincy Esqr. died and left my wife her full proportion of his Estate with his other relations. When I was called to Congress in 
1774 I left as full Practice as any Lawyer ever held in this State. I left Debts due to me on Books to a large amount, and many other Debts on Notes and Bonds. 
My friend and Agent collected what he could and lent to the Publick. I have been ten years Ambassador abroad, eight years Vice President of the United States 
and four years President.

Your Letter of the 20th., My dear Friend, has filled 
my Eyes with Tears, and, indurated stoick as I am, my 
heart with sensations unutterable by my tongue or pen. 
Not the feelings of Vanit)', but the overwhelming sense 
of my own Un worthiness of such a Panegyrick from 
such a Friend. Like Louis the 16 I said to myself 
Qu'est ce, que j'ai fait pour le meriter. Have I not 
been employed in Mischief all my days ? Did not the 
American Revolution produce the French Revolution ? 
and did not the French Revolution produce all the 
Calamities and Desolations to the human Race and the 
whole Globe ever since ? I meant well however. My 
conscience was clear as a Christal Glass without a 
scruple or a doubt. I was borne along by an irresistable sense of duty. God prospered our labours : and 
awful, dreadfull and deplorable as the Consequences 
have been, I cannot but hope that the Ultimate Good of 
the World, of the human Race, and of our beloved 
Country is intended and will be accomplished by it 
While I was in this Reverie I handed your letter to my 
Brother Cranch, the Postmaster of eighty-five years of 
Age, an Israelite indeed, who read it with great Attention and at length started up and exclaimed •' I have 
known you sixty years and I can bear Testimony as a 
Witness to everj^ Word your Friend has said in this 
Letter in your Favour.*' This compleated my humiliation and Confusion. Your Letter is the most serious 
and solemn one I ever received in my Life. It has 
aroused and harrowed up my soul. I know not what 
to say in answer to it, or to do in consequence of it 

It is most certain that the end of my Life cannot be 
remote. My eyes are constantly fixed upon it, according to the Precept or advice of the ancient Philosopher. 
And if I am not in a total delusion, I daily behold and 
contemplate it without dismay. 

If by dedicating all the rest of my days to the Composition of such an address as you propose I could have any 
rational assurance of doing any real good to my fellow 
Citizens of United America, I would cheerfully lay aside 
all other occupations and amusements and devote myself 
to it But there are difficulties and embarrassments in 
the Way, which to me, at present, appear insuperable* 

1. '*The sensibility of the Public Mind" which you 
anticipate at my Decease, will not be so favourable to 
my Memor&gt;' as you seem to foresee. By the treatment 
I have received and continue to receive I should expect 
that a large Majority of all Parties would corrlially 
rejoice to hear that my head was laid low, 

2. I am surprised to read your opinion that '* my Integrity has never been called in Question/' and that 
** Friends and Enemies agree in believing me Uf F^e an 
honest man.'* If I am to judge by the N'ew&lt;;paper^ and 
Pamphlets that have been printed in America fV&gt;r twenty 
years past, I should think that both Parties believed me 
the meanest Villain in the World. 

3. If they should not .aspect me of sinning in tlv^ 
Grave" they will char&gt;;e me with .VJnshn-^?^ ;^nd Hypocrisy before my death, -n preparing an ad^lress Xfy 
move the Passions of the P^^opie 'AT^A excite th^m rty 
promote my children and perhaps x&lt;, mnk^, my v&gt;n a 
King. Washington an^l Franklin rr^u'wl nev^r '-lo ;»ny 
Thing but what wa.s impute/J to yyr^. ^isin*&lt;^r'^*t'/^d 
Patriotism. I aev^tr ^x&gt;n\ri 4o any 7's\\ri':4 .v&gt;t jrlv^t pta^ 

to Sinister &gt;fotiv^,^. 

4. I agree with you in Sentiment that ReHgion and 
Virtue are the only Foundations, not only of Republicanism and of all free Government, but of social felicity 
under all Governments and in all the Combinations of 
human Society. But if I should inculcate this doctrine 
in my Will, I should be charged with Hypocrisy and a 
desire to conciliate the good will of the Clergy towards 
my Family as I was charged by Dr. Priestley and his 
Friend Cooper and by Quakers, Baptists and I know 
not how many other sects, for instituting a National 
Fast, for even common Civility to the Clergy, and for 
being a Church going animal. 

5. If I should inculcate those " National, Social, domestic and religious virtues*' you recommend, I should 
be suspected and charged with an hypocritical, Machiavilian, Jesuitical, Pharisaical attempt to promote a national establishment of Presbyterianism in America, 
whereas I would as soon establish the Episcopal Church, 
and almost as soon the Catholic Church. 

6. If I should inculcate Fidelity to the Marriage Bed, 
it would be said that it proceeded from Resentment to 
General Hamilton, and a malicious desire to hold up to 
Posterity his Libertinism. 

7. Others would say that it is only a vain glorious 
ostentation of my own Continence. For among all the 
Errors, Follies, Failings, Vices and Crimes which have 
been so plentifully imputed to me, I cannot recollect a 
single Insinuation against me of any amorous Intrigue, 
or irregular or immoral connection with Woman, single 
or married, myself a Batcheller or a married Man. 

8. If I should recommend the Sanctification of the 
Sabbath like a divine, or even only a regular attendance 
on publick Worship as a means of moral Instruction 
and Social Improvement like a Phylosopher or Statesman, I should be charged with vain ostentation again, 
and a selfish desire to revive the Remembrance of my 
own Punctuality in this Respect, for it is notorious 
enough that I have been a Church going animal for 
seventy six years i.e. from the Cradle; and this has 
been alledged as one Proof of my Hypocrisy. 

9. Fifty three years ago I was fired with a Zeal, 
amounting to Enthusiasm against ardent spirits; the 
Multiplication of Taverns, Retailers, dram shops and 
tippling houses ; grieved to the heart to see the number 
of idlers, Thieves, sots and consumptive Patients made 
for the Phisicians in those infamous seminaries. I applied to the Court of Sessions, procured a Committee 
of Inspection and Inquiry, reduced the number of 
licensed Houses &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c. But I only acquired the 
Reputation of a Hypocrite and an ambitious Demagogue 
by it: the Number of licensed Houses was soon reinstated, drams, grog and sotting were not diminished 
and remain to this day as deplorable as ever. You 
may as well preach to the Indians against Rum as to 
our People. Litde Turtle petitioned me to prohibit 
Rum to be sold to his Nation ; for a very good reason, 
because he said I had lost three thousand of my Indian 
Children in his Nation in one year by it 

Sermons, moral discourses, Phylosophical dissertations, medical advice are all lost upon this subject. 
Nothing but making the Commodity scarce and dear 
will have any Effect. And your Republican Friend, 
and I had almost said mine, Jefferson, would not permit Rum or Whiskey to be taxed. 

If I should then in my Will, my Dying Legacy, my 
posthumous Exhortation, call it what you will, recommend heavy, prohibitory Taxes upon Spirituous Liquors, 
which I believe to be the only Remedy against their 
deleterious Qualities in society, every one of your 
Brother Republicans and nine tenths of the Federalists 
would say that I was a canting Puritan, a profound 
Hypocrite, setting up standards of Morality, Frugality, 
Economy, Temperance, Simplicity and Sobriety that I 
knew the age was incapable of. 

10. Funds and Banks. I never approved or was 
satisfied with our Funding System. It was founded on 
no consistent Principle. It was continued to enrich 
particular Individuals at the public expense. Our 
whole banking system I ever abhorred, I continue to 
abhor, and shall die abhorring. But I am not an ennemy 
to Funding Systems. They are absolutely and indispensably necessary in the present state of the World 
An attempt to annihilate or prevent them would be as 
Romantic an Adventure as any in Don Quixot or in 
Oberon. A national Bank of deposit I believe to be 
wise, just, prudent, economical and necessary. But 
every Bank of discount, every Bank by which interest 
is to be paid, or Profit of any kind made by the Deponent is downright Corruption. It is taxing the public for the benefit and profit of Individuals. It is worse 
than old time continental Currency, or any other Paper 
Money. 

Now sir, if I should talk in this strain after I am 
dead, you know the people of America would pronounce that I had died mad. 

11. My opinion is that a circulating Medium of Gold 
and silver only ought to be introduced and established, 
that a National Bank of Deposit only, with a branch in 
each State, should be allowed ; that every Bank in the 

Union ought to be annihilated, and every Bank of Discount prohibited to all Eternity. Not one farthing of 
Profit should ever be allowed on any Money deposited 
in the Bank. Now, my Friend, if in my posthumous 
Sermon, Exhortation, Advice, Address or what ever 
you may call it, I should gravely deliver such a Doctrine, nine tenths of Republicans as well as Federalists 
will think that I ought to have been consigned to your 
tranquillizing Chair, rather than permitted to write such 
extravagances. 

Franklin, Washington, Hamilton, and all our disinterested Patriots and Heroes it will be said, have 
sanctioned Paper Money and Banks, and who is this 
Pedant and Bigot of a John Adams who from the ground 
sounds the toxin against all our best men, when every 
Body knows he never had any Thing in View but his 
private Interest from his Birth to his Death. 

1 2. Free schools, and all Schools, Colledges, Academies and Seminaries of learning I can recommend from 
my heart ; but I dare not say that a suffrage " should 
never be permitted to a Man, who cannot read and 
write." What would become of the Republic of France 
if the Lives, Fortunes, Charities of twenty four Millions 
and an half of Men who can neither read nor write, 
should be at the absolute disposal of five hundred 
thousand who can read ? 

1 3. I am not qualified to write such an address. The 

style should be pure, elegant, eloquent and pathetick in 

the highest degree. It should be revised, corrected, 

oblitterated, interpolated, amended, transcribed twenty 

times, polished, refined, varnished, burnished. To all 

these employments and exercises I am a total stranger. 

To my sorrow I have never copied nor corrected nor embellished. I understand it not. I never could write 
Declamations, Orations or popular Addresses. 

14. If I could persuade my Friend Rush, or my Friend 
Idy, my Friend Trimbul or my Friend Humphrys, or 
perhaps my Friend Jefferson to write such a Thing for 
me, I know not why I might not transcribe it, as Washington did so often. Borrowed eloquence if it contains 
as good stuff, is as good as own eloquence. 

15. The example you recollect of Caesar's Will is an 
awful Warning. Posthumous addresses may be left by 
Caesar as well as Cato, Brutus or Cicero and will oftener 
perhaps be applauded and make deeper impressions, 
establish Empires easier than restore Republicks : promote Tyranny sooner than Liberty. 

Your advice my Friend, flows from the Piety, Benevolence and Patriotism of your heart. I know of no Man 
better qualified to write such an address than yourself. 
If you will try your hand at it and send me the result, I 
will consider it maturely. I will not promise to adopt 
it as my own : but I may make a better use of it than 
of any Thing I could write. 

My Brother Cranch thinks you one of the best and 
one of the profoundest Christians^ He prays me to 
present you his best Compliments, and although he has 
not the Honour nor the pleasure of a personal acquaintance, has the highest esteem of your character. He 
prays me to inclose a sermon, not for its own sake so 
much as for the Appendix, which he asks you to read 
and give him your opinion of it Will you shew it to 
our Friend Wharton and get his opinion of it. I am as 
I ever have been and ever shall be 

your admiring Friend

My Friend, — Suum cuique decus Posteritas rependit, 
has some Truth in it and you have adduced several examples of it : but it is by no means an universal Aphorism, nor do I believe it to be generally true. You 
seem to think that Integrity is less envied than Talents. 
This Question deserves consideration. Under the 
Roman Emperors nothing was envied so much as 
Integrity or even the appearance or suspicion of Integrity, ** Ob virtutis certissimum exitium.*' The vote 
to banish Aristides, because he was trumpeted for his 
Justice, I will not alledge in my favour ; because I think 
with his Fellow Citizens, that, tho a just Man in the 
main, he was not celebrated for his real Integrity so 
much as for the most unjust action of his life, in destroying the ballance of the Constitution, and giving 
that Preponderance to the Poor over the rich which 
soon produced the ruin of the Athenian Commonwealth. Aristides destroyed the ballance of Solon, and 
gave uncontrollable power to the Plebeians who immediately cryed out "Justice! Justice! Huzza for Aristides the Just.'' You, Rush! would not have borne 
this prostitution of the word Justice better than the 
Athenian did. 

To be sure honest Men have been satyrized, ridiculed, 
calumniated, belied. Sometimes the Lies have stuck, 
sometimes not. Julius Caesar, as corrupt a Rascal as 
Sallust, and as exquisite a writer, wrote Anticatones, 
i.e. Libels against Cato. Who has destroyed these 
villainous effusions of allarmed ambition? Not the 
Friends of Liberty surely ; they never had the power. 
It must have been Roman Tyrants, heathen or Christian, 
ecclesiastical or temporal. I would consent that Callender Paine and Hamilton should write ten times as 
much Billingsgate against me as they have done, if by 
this Condition I could procure a Copy of Csesars Anticatones. 

We have a beautiful specimen of your Doctrine in 
Dion Cassius. He flourished under the most Tyrannical 
of the Emperors by whom he was promoted to great 
Power and Digrnities from the time of the Antonines to 
that of Alexander Severus. Dion calls Cicero's Father 
a Fuller, who nevertheless got his Living by dressing 
other Mens vines and olives ; that Cicero was born and 
bred amidst the scourings of old Cloaths, and the Filth 
of Dunghills ; that he was master of no liberal science, 
nor ever did a single Thing in his Life worthy of a great 
Man or an Orator : that he prostituted his Wife ; trained 
up his son in drunkenness ; committed Incest with his 
Daughter ; lived in Adultery with Cerellia, whom he 
owns at the same time to be seventy years old. What 
more beautiful calumny against me can you find in Ned 
Church, Phillip Freneau. Andrew Brown, Peter Markoe, 
Calender, Duane, Cheetham, Hamilton, or the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> 
Chronicle, Repertor}% Gazette or Continental ? 

My Friend and Priest, Mr. Wibert, an admirer of 
Whitefield once in Company with him observed " Mr. Whitefield ! You have been abused in Pamphlets and 
Journals a great while, and they still continue to insult 
you every day ; does it not often affect your spirits ?" 
**Oh no," said Whitefield, "if they knew how much 
pleasure they give me they would not do it'' 

Still I insist upon it, let Whitefield say what he wiU, 
it is not a pleasant Thing to be told every day in a 
Newspaper that one is a Rascal, a Scoundrel, a Lyar, 
a Villain, a Thief, a Robber, a Traytor, an Apostate ; 
even although we know and the world in general knows 
that those who call us so are really what they call us. 

It would be very easy my Friend to compose an address which should contain nothing but obvious Truths 
that all Men would at once approve. Such was Washingtons. Religion, Morality, Union, Constitution. Who 
even among the Atheists, the despisers and abhorrers 
of the Constitution, the Disorganizers and Promoters 
of a Northern Confederacy, would dare publickly to 
attack such Topics? What good has Washingtons 
address done? Both parties quote it as an oracle. 
But neither party cares one farthing about it. With 
the knowing ones of both Parties it is known to have 
fto Weight but as Argumentum ad hominem to the ignorant of both sides. Such an address would not be 
worth my while. In all my publick writings for more 
than forty years I have sufficiently explained my sentiments and sufficiendy warned my Countrymen against 
the dangers of American Liberty, long enough before 
the pretty Pratder Ames wrote his Jeremiads. I could 
sum up and abridge all I have written ; but this would 
comprehend everything relative to Forms of Grovernment, which you expressly prohibit me from touching. In 
my opinion every Thing depends on the form of Government. Without this you may declaim on Religion, Morality, Union, Constitution to all Eternity to no purpose. 

Mr. kichardson of S. C. was much esteemed here by 
all Parties. Whoever gave him the Information that 
my Property was worth between 80,000 and an 1 00,000 
dollars infected his head with much exaggeration. My 
Estate is chiefly in Lands in this town of Qulncy ; I 
have hone anywhere else excepting a bit or two of 
Cedar Swamp in <a href='/results.php?city=braintree' rel='city'>Braintree</a> and Randolph the whole of 
which would not sell for five hundred dollars. 

I have two farms in <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>: the best would not sell 
at Vendue for twenty thousand Dollars ; the other on 
which I live, would not sell for more than Ten. My 
Personal Estate is partly in a Middlesex Canal, which 
has never produced one farthing of Rent, but a continued Augmentation of Expense ; and partly in a New 
Market which is not likely to produce any Profit soon, 
if ever. My real estate has never produced two Per 
Cent on the estimate I have given you. In short I 
have never added one farthing to my Property for ten 
years ; but on the Contrary have been obliged to make 
Inroads on my little Capital. 

The foregoing Computations have all been made in 
the present depreciated state of the value of Bank 
Bills, the most fraudulent engines that ever were invented by private Avarice to violate the Tenth Commandment. What were Woods half pence ? Oh, that 
we had a Dean Swift, or even a Thomas Hutchinson ! 

In this depreciated Currency if you compute my 
Fortune at fifty thousand dollars, you will lay it as 
high as the Truth will bear. And my Income from 
it, is far short of the Legal Interest of that sum.

Adversity of which she has had a large share has never

Dear Rush, — 

SoBRius EsTO ! Recollect your own NoN Nobis! 

Your Letter of the 20th. of September I communicated to Mrs. Adams as you advised. Mrs. Adams to 
her daughter. After a reasonable time for Deliberation 
and Reflection the Heroine determined. The Mother 
and the Daughter went to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> and consulted Dr. 
Warren Junior, Dr. Welsh, Dr. Warren Junior having 
previously consulted Dr. Tufts and Dr. Holbrook. 
The Physicians and Surgeons all unanimously pronounced Dr. Rush's opinion and advice to be exactly 
and perfectly in all Points agreeable to their own, and 
the Plan was laid and the Catastrophy resolved. 

On Tuesday the eighth of October, a day memorable 
in my little Annals, the operation was performed in 
Presence of the two Dr. Warrens, Dr. Welsh and Dr. 
Holbrook by Dr. Warren Senior. The operation was 
twenty five Minutes in performing, and the dressing an 
hour longer. 

The surgeons all agree that in no Instance did they 
ever witness a Patient of more Intrepidity than she exhibited through the whole transaction. 

They all affirm that the morbid substance is totally 
eradicated and nothing left but Flesh perfectly sound. 

They all agree that the Probability of compleat and 
ultimate success is as great as in any instance that has 
fallen under their experience. 

Yesterday October 12 the surgeons met again and 
dressed the wound and unanimously declare it in as 
good a state as they could expect. 

Had not your Letter overcome all her Scruples and 
Timidity, I believe she would have returned before now 
to Smiths Valley, which would have been to her The 
Valley of Jehosaphat. 

Oh ! that a vaccine Inoculation could be discovered 
for this opprobrium of Phylosophy and Medicine, The 
Cancer, This Physical disgrace of human Nature! 

Neither you nor I have much superstition in our 
Natures or our Creeds. But neither of us can refuse 
to acknowledge a <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> in this Instance. She accidentally as the World says read your Book wrote you 
a letter, received your answer altered her plan, postponed her Journey home, and as I sincerely hope and 
devoutly pray saved her life. 

I rejoice however still with trembling. I know the 
uncertainty that still remains, and that our only ultimate 
Resource is Resignation. 

We are all very sensible of our obligation to you 

and pray you to accept our cordial Thanks.

Dear Sir, — Shall I congratulate or condole with you 
on the appointment of your son to be Comptroller of 
the Treasury? You will lose the delightful Comfort 
of his daily society and that of his Lady and their prattling little oties, which I know by experience to be in old 
age among the sweetest enjoyments of Life, provided 
always that it be not indulged to excess. 

I should have thought too that his office of Attorney 
General and his practice at the Bar would have not 
only given him better Profits but opened to him better 
Prospects. I should have thought too that he had too 
much Genius, Imagination and Taste to be able to 
reconcile himself to a life of such painful drudgery as 
casting accounts, examining vouchers, etc. 

I presume nevertheless that he can reconcile himself 
to it ; and there are many advantages in being near the 
Fountain. Mr. Gallatin has been so long in that laborious situation that he probably will not be content to 
hold it many years. I wish Mr. Rush may be his successor. In either office he will have an opportunity of 
acquiring a general knowledge of Public affairs and 
become qualified for any employment, civil, political, 
judiciary or diplomatical at home or abroad. My best 
wishes attend him wherever he is. 

We have seen advertised in the Aurora and several 
other Southern Papers Dr. Franklins works and especially his Journal in France: and although these 
advertisements have been continued and repeated for 
years, no Man here has ever seen or heard of the 
Book. Pray tell me what this means ? 

I am told too that Colonel Duane has announced his 
Intention to take me in hand for what I have published 
concerning Dr. Franklin. He is welcome. 1 have published my proofs as well as Complaints. Let the world 
judge. 

I have hot been such a disinterested Patriot as to 
have Five hundred and thirty thousand dollars to assist 
me in my defence. 

I am as ever yours

Dear Sir, — When I was a Boy, not ten years old I heard Smith Richard Thayer, a great Authoritj'. say "When Dut\- and Interest go together, they make Staving Work." 

By your own shewing it was Richards Dut)* to be overuled or ruled over by his Wife : and by my shewing I will make it appear to be his Interest. 

He will soon be Secretarx^ of the Treasury-, or he 
may be a Judge of the Supreme Court, or an Ambassador abroad when he pleases : or perhaps Vice President or President. Pensilx-ania has not had her share, 
and Virginia a fourfold Proportion of American Honours. Virginia must now court Pensilvania and New 
York too, or these two last will soon join New England and play the Mischief with the first 

The Reason why Pensilvania had not her share in 
the first txvelve years, was that Pensilvania appeared, 
according to Farmers Daemonolog)', to be seized by 
the Spirit which entered into the swine and rushed 
down steep into the Sea. 

Mifflin, McKean, Dallas, all of you indeed, seemed 
to have adopted what The great Randolph calls ** The 
infernal Principles of French Fraternization." They 
were for going to War with England, and forming a 
close alliance with Robespierre and his forerunners and 
after followers. I thought this Project no better than 
making a League with the Devil. I have wondered 
that Jefferson did not promote Pensilvanians. I am 
glad Madison begins to think of it 

I know how it is. It is so sweet, fatigued at Night 
with Study and Business, to sit down and chat with 
Consort and Daughters and Son Richard and his fascinating wife that you cannot bear to think of losing any 
part of the Entertainment. Just so have I fretted several times when they have taken away from me my Comfort. But Non Nobis, Non nobis Solis nati Sumus. 

Mrs. Smith's Breast is "perfectly and radically 
healed." Her arm is weak and stiff, but the Surgeons 
say it will be perfectly restored by time. 

Your mute Art is far preferable to the loquacious 
ones. What becomes of all the great Talkers ? What 
happened to Cicero, Demosthenes, Burk, Fox, Pitt, 
Otis, Patrick Henry, R. H. Lee, Bayard, Ames, Dexter, Harper, and a thousand others? I sometimes 
think that orators are unfit for Judges or Legislative 
or Executive offices ; any Thing that requires cool 
deliberation and deep Judgment. A mute Franklin or 
a mute Washington or even a mute Jefferson is not to 
be found among all our orators ; at least in success and 
popular Importance. 

What will become, too, of our two great reigning orators, Randolph and Quincy? They had better hold their Tongues, 

The Winds begin to rustle, the Clouds gather, it 
grows dark: will these airy Forces rear up the ocean 
to a foaming Fury ? A Spirit seems to be rising ; a 
Spirit of Contrition and Shame at our long Apathy 
and Lethargy; a Spirit of Resentment of Injuries; a 
Spirit of Indignation at Insolence ; and what to me is 
very remarkable, a Spirit of greater Unanimity than I 
have ever witnessed in this country for fifty years. 
What say you to your Friend ?

My worthy Friend, — I have reed, your favour of 
the 26th. of Dec. You mention Cobbet. Have you 
read Mr. Randolphs speech? Was there any Thing 
in Cobbets writings more envious than that speech? 

Now I assure you upon my honour and the Faith of 
the Friendship between us, that I never saw the face of 
that Cobbet ; that I should not know him if I met him 
in my Porridge Dish ; that I never wrote one word in 
his Paper and had no more connection with him than 
with Phillip Freneau or Colonel Duane. What shall I 
say of Mr. Randolph? After a dozen years he cannot 
forget the foolish Figure he made, when after insulting 
the whole Army by calling them Raggamuffins, he 
thought himself insulted by some officers of the Army 
at the Theatre and instead of calling tliem to account 
according to his professed Principles, complained like 
a Baby to me of a Breach of the Priviledges of the 
House. I sent the Complaint to the House whose sole 
Right it was to vindicate its Priviledges, and got the 
laugh of the Universe upon him. This, such a Soul 
as his can never forgive. Pray tell me what is the 
Republicanism of this Mr. Randolph ? Has he any one 
Principle of Legislation or Government or of foreign 
Relations? I say his Republicanism is any Thing, 
every Thing and Nothing. I do not flap this Bug and 
many others, not because I fear their stings, but because I know that when crushed their odour is more 
nauseous than their stings can be painful. 

Another Thing Dr. Rush ! You know it was circulated and believed throughout the City of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
that I had set up and established John Fenns and his 
United States Gazette ; to introduce Monarchy. I say 
you know it, because you told me so yourself, and at 
the same time said that Freneaus National Gazette 
was set up to oppose the Vice President and his United 
States Gazette. 

Now I declare to you I never knew any Thing of 
Freneau till I found him established at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
and his Paper established ; that I never contributed a 
Farthing to his establishment or support, and that I 
never wrote a line in his Paper but the Discourses 
on Davila. 

You know too the Time when there was not a 
Quaker or Proprietary- Partisan in Pensilvania who 
would not gladly have seen my neck in a Halter and 
me kicking in the air as Col. Harrisons Imagination 
represented himself and Mr. Gerry ; and that long 
before the Declaration of Independence, and merely 
because I was suspected of having Independence in 
view as a last resort. 

You know too that I have lived in an enemies country in France, in Holland and in England, as well as in 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. Massachusetts and throughout the Union, and 
am so to this dav. 

What of all this ? Such are the Terms upon which 
an honest Man and real Friend to his Country must 
live in times such as these we have been destined to 
witness. And what is worse than all, we must leave 
these Prejudices and Enmities to our Children as 
their Inheritance. From the year 1761, now more than 
Fifty years, I have constantly lived in an enemies 
Country. And that without having one Personal 
enemy in the World, that I know of. I do not consider litde Flirts and Spatts and Miffs and Piques forgotten by me in a Moment as enmities, tho others may 
have remembered them longer. 

Now I hope I have prepared the way in some measure, for giving you my opinion of your enemys Country, and I humbly hope in some tho a less degree I fear, 
of my own. In my opinion there is not in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> a single Citizen more universally esteemed and 
beloved by his Fellow Citizens than Dr. Benjamin 
Rush. There is not a man in Pensilvania more esteemed by the whole State. I know not a man in 
America more esteemed by the nation. There is not 
a Citizen of this Union, more esteemed throughout the 
litterary, Scientifical, and Moral World in Europe, Asia 
and Africa. Such in my opinion is the enemies Country and enemies World in which you live and will die. 

There is nevertheless not a Tory and scarcely a Whig 
in America but talks about Dr. Rush and will tell twent)' 
absurd and ridiculous stories about him as well as John 
Adams. I will give you one example in perfect Confidence. Let the secret be as close as the grave. A 
Gentleman told me lately " That General Washington 
was a Hypocrite." A hypocrite ! What do you mean ? 
" He was a Hypocrite" — and mentioned several things, 
but " one instance alone was sufficient proof of his Hypocrisy.'* What is that? ** He appointed Dr. Rush to 
a lucrative and respectable office, that of Treasurer of 
the Mint." And what proof of Hypocrisy was that? 
** Why I know that he thought Dr. Rush a villain ; and 
believing him to be so, it was Hypocrisy to appoint him 
to such an office of Trust.*' And how do you know 
that he thought so ill of Dr. Rush ? Such a gentleman 
whom he named but I will not, '*the most intimate 
Friend of Gen. Washington, told me that he had heard 
him say, that he had been a good deal in the world and 
seen many bad Men, but Dr. Rush was the most black 
hearted scoundrel he had ever known." This is horrid 
said I, both upon Washington and Rush ; but the l^est 
of it is that Washington while President never appointed Rush to any thing. It was myself who appointed Rush Treasurer of the Mint, and so far from 
repenting of it, or thinking it a Proof of Hypocrisy, I 
thought Dr. Rush one of the best Men in the World, 
and his appointment one of the best that had been 
made. He acknowledged, that if this was so, he had 
been mistaken in the author of Rush's appointment, 
but he was not so in the account he had given of Washington's speech to his Friend, 

Your PosteritN' and mine, I doubt not my Friend, 
will be teased and vexed with a Million of such stories 
concerning us, when we shall be no more. In the 
struggles and Competitions of fift)' or sixt&gt;' years in 
times that taxed Mens Hearts and Brains and .Spina)

will be treated as she deserves. Never was there two 

such Dupes as Pensilvania and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> have been.

Dear Sir, — The greatest part of the History in your 
last Letter was well known to me, and I could write you 
six sheets for your three, full of Anecdotes of a similar 
complexion. I wanted no satisfaction. If I had, your 
Letter would have given it. 

The great Character was a Character of Convention. 
His first appointment was a magnanimous sacrifice of 
the North to the South ; to the base Jealousy, sordid 
Envy, and ignorant Prejudices of the Southern and 
Middle States, against New England. I know what I 
say, and I will not tremble like your old Friend at the 
danger of " giving offence." 

Mr. Widgery, previous to his return home from our Legislature waited on our Governor Sullivan, pour 
prendre conge. The Governor had heard from some 
Tatler of a light speech concerning himself, and reed. 
his visitor coldlv. \V. felt it and discovered some sensibility of it. S. irritated, said ** I set little value on 
these visits of Ceremony from Men who set so litde 
value upon me in other Companies." W. raised his 
head, and with great dignit)' said " Sir ! Who made 
you Governor?" An explanation ensued and a Reconciliation. 

I mentioned a Character of Convention. There was 
a time when Northern, Middle and Southern Statesmen, and Northern, Middle and Southern Officers of 
the Army, expressly agreed to blow the Trumpet of 
Panegyrick in concert : to cover and dissemble all 
Faults and Errors : to represent every defeat as a Victory, and every Retreat as an Advancement : to make 
that Character popular and fashionable, with all Parties 
in all places and with all persons, as a Centre of Union, 
as the Central Stone in the Geometrical Arch. 

There you have the revelation of the whole Mystery. 
Something of the same kind has occurred in France 
and has produced a Napoleon and his Empire. And, 
my Friend, something hereafter may produce similar 
conventions to cry up a Burr, a Hamilton, an Arnold or 
a Caesar, Julius or Borgia. And on such foundations 
have been erected Mahomet, Zingis Tamerlane Kouli 
Alexander and all the other great Conquerors this world 
has produced. 

Pray have you not often heard the Honorable Timothy Pickering speak of the Great Character ? I have. 
And at various Periods of time from 1791 when I lived in Mrs. Keppele's house at the Corner of Arch Street 
and fourth street, to 1797 after I was chosen President. 

I lament, my dear Friend, that you were not in Congress in 1774 and 1775. A thousand things happened 
there in those years that no Man now living knows but 
myself. Mr. Gerry, Mr. Lovel was not there. Gerrj', 
not till 1776. Lovel not till 1777. 1774 was the most 
important and the most difficult year of all. We were 
about one third Tories, one third timid, and one third 
true Blue. We had a code of Fundamental Laws to 
prepare for a whole Continent of incongruous Colonies. 
It was done ; and the Declaration of Independence in 
1776 was no more than a repetition of the Principles, 
the Rights and Wrongs asserted and adopted in 1774. 

Ought not your Philosophical Society to institute an 
Inquiry into the Truth of the terrible accounts of Earthquakes at the Southward and Westward. I suspect 
something very wicked at the bottom of most of those 
stories that falsis terroribus implent our good Ladies 
and innocent Children. 

<a href='/results.php?city=monticello' rel='city'>Monticello</a> owes a Letter to Maremont, or Merry 
Mount, or Mount Wollaston, for by all these names the 
Place has been called. 

If you have educated or suffered to be brought up 
your Family in Idolatry you ought to read to them that 
Chapter in the Old Testament which contains Moses*s 
tremendous Curses against Idolatry. 

If I were to write this Letter over again I could make 
it methodical and correct the grammar, without sending 
it to Petersburg. 

I am as ever yours

My dear Friend, — Omnicient Jackson said to me at 
his own Table and repeated it at mine in London, that 
Chatham flattered the vanity of the Nation and gratified 
their Passion for War, but that he was a pernicious 
Minister. David Hartley said to me often ; [it was a 
favorite observation with him] that Chatham was a 
national Minister but not a wise Minister. So far I am 
out of your debt. I have given you a Jackson and a 
Hardey for your Sanbridge, two for one. Nay I have 
repaid you fourfold ; for either of mine was worth two 
of yours ; for in very truth I have no veneration for 
Sanbridge or his Sister. With Madam Graham and 
her Husband I was well acquainted. I have read her 
History, though Johnson had not, and esteem it at least 
as much as "Taxation no Tyranny." The bellowing 
Bulls and roaring Cows of Faction deserve an equal 
estimation. But mark the Morals and Religion and 
Politicks of our own dearly beloved Country. Madam 
Graham came to America and was worse than neglected : 
Madam Hayley alias Madam Jeffrey came here and was 
more than caressed. Upon my honor, my Heart would 
prefer the latter. My understanding would be in 
doubt : quite a Pyrrhonist in the morals, Politicks and 
Religion of the Question between the two. 

Who ever called in question the Military Talents of 
Alexander, Caesar, Zingis, Tamerlane, Mahomet, Cromwell, Marlborough ? Had these no Friends ? Bonaparte, 
my Friend Rush, has as many Friends as either of them. 
Aye, and more than Amherst or Wolfe. Death is the 
great Friend Maker. Had Wolfe lived and Amherst 
died, Amherst would have been enrolled among 
Patriots, Heroes, Saints ; and Wolfe would have been 
goldstick charged with selling all the Commissions 
in the Army. Had Socrates not died by Poison he 
would never have been more than Zeno, Epicurus, 
Pythagoras or Heraclitus or Democritus. Warren or 
Montgomery would have been no more than Green, 
Mifflin or Knox. Warren however ought to have been 
more, for he was more than all of them. 

Louis 14th. was blackened by the English more than 
Napoleon is, but in Germany he was thought to be a 
Saviour, a Friend of Liberty and a Protector of the 
Rights of the Princes and Electors against the Ambition, Avarice and Tyranny of the Emperor and the 
House of Austria. In Italy he was thought to be a 
Friend of Liberty and a Protector against the Pope, 
the Emperor, the King of Spain and the grand Senior. 

Napoleon does no more than tread in his steps. He 
is treated in the same manner by the English; and 
considered in the same Light in Germany and Italy ; 
and in Spain too. Call him what you will, blacken him 
with all the Names and Epithets of Infamy if you 
please, I will neither quarrel, contradict or dispute. 
But still I will say he has been employed as an Instrument to defend France from the meditated Partition of 
Pilnits, from several Coalitions of all the great Powers 
of Europe to destroy France, Christendom from the 
Intolerance of Rome, and the human Race from that 
Inundation of bloody Jacobinical Democracy which was 
overwhelming all Liberty, Property, Religion and Morality among Men. 

Our dear Countrymen, *' the most enlightened People 
upon Earth'' you know, think themselves Masters of 
the Drama of Europe and its Actors and Actresses. 
Good souls ! They are as ignorant as Fisher Ames. 
How that warbling Bob O'Lincoln affirms and denies, 
applauds and denounces upon subjects of which he 
knows no more than the Master of his Piggery ! Nor 
than one of his old apple trees that he had sense 
enough to know would not bear transplanting from 
Dedham to <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a> Common. 

Washington had Friends, real Friends : so had 
Cromwell, and so has Napoleon, and so had Louis 14th. 
Which of the four had most hypocritical Friends, which 
most political Friends, I pretend not to conjecture, 

That Washington was not a schollar is certain. 
That he was too illiterate, unlearned, unread for his 
station and reputation is equally past dispute. He 
had derived little Knowledge from Reading, none from 
Travel, except in the United States, and excepting one 
Trip in his youth to one of the West India Islands and 
directly back again. From Conversation in publick 
and private, he had improved considerably and by Reflection in his Closet, a good deal. He was indeed a 
thoughtful Man. 

The most experienced and scientific Officers about 
him, Lee, Gates, Steuben, Conway, etc, thought little 
of him : some of them despised him too much. Green, 
Knox, Clinton, without thinking highly of him except 
for his honesty, were his sworn and invariable Friends. 
Of all his Aids and Secretaries, David Humphreys 
alone has been discreet enough to let no Levity escape 
him. Never Poet was truer to his Patron. 

Mifflin, one of his Generals, Hamilton Burr have 
been very indiscreet, Pickering, his Quarter Master, 
has at times been outragious. Now I will give you a 
little true History. 

In the year 1791 when I lived in Mrs. Keppele's 
house, at the corner of Arch street and fourth street 
in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, Colonel Pickering made me a visit, and 
finding me alone, spent a long evening with me. We 
had a multitude of conversation. I had then lately 
purchased Matthew Gary's American Museum, the 
Ninth Volume of which then lay upon my table. Colonel Pickering observing the book said he was acquainted 
with the Work and particularly with that Volume of 
it : and there was a Letter in it that he was extremely 
sorry to see there. I asked what Letter is that ? C. 
Pickering answered, it is a Letter from General Washington. I said I had read it and attended to it. You 
my Friend Rush, by looking into the 282nd. page of 
that 9th. volume will find a letter from George Washington dated <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a> July 31st. 1788.  Col. Pickering said he was extremely sorry to see that 
Letter in print. I asked him why ? What do you see 
amiss in it? What harm will it do? Col. Pickering 
said it will injure General Washington's Character. 
How will it injure him? Stratagems are lawful in 
War. Colonel Pickering answered me, it will hurt his 
moral Character. He has been generally tliought to 
be honest and I own I thought his morals were good, 
but that Letter is false and I know it to be so. I knew 
him to be vain and weak and ignorant, but I thought 
he was well meaning : but that Letter is a Lye and I 
know it to be so. I objected and queried. Pickering 
explained and descended to particulars. He said it 
was false in Washington to pretend that he had meditated beforehand to deceive the Ennemy, and to that 
end to deceive the officers and soldiers of his own 
Army : that he had seriously meditated an attack upon 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> for near a twelve month and had made 
preparations at an immense expense for that purpose. 
Washington never had a thought of marching to the 
Southward, till the Count de Grasses Fleet appeared 
upon the Coast. He knew it, and Washington knew 
it, consequently that Letter was a great disgrace. As 
I had never before heard Washingtons Veracity assailed, I was uneasy and argued and queried with him. 
But Pickering persisted, repeated, and urged Facts 
and orders which I knew nothing of, and could not 
answer. But he dwelt with most delight on Washington's Ignorance, Weakness and Vanity. He was so 
Ignorant that he had never read any Thing, even on 
military affairs : he could not write a sentence of Grammar, nor spell his words, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. To this I objected. I had been in Congress with Washington in 
I 774 and in May and part of June 1775 and had heard 
and read all his Letters to Congress in 1775, 1776, 
1777, and had formed a very different opinion of his 
litterary Talent. His Letters were well written and 
well spelled, Pickering replied **he did not write 
them; he only copied them.'' Who did write them? 
** His Secretaries and Aids," and I think he mentioned 
Reed, Harrison and Tilghman. 

Pickering had come from Wioming to solicit employment, as I suppose. He obtained the Post Office, the 
Secretaryship of War and of State under Washington, 
who could not spell or write Grammar but would lie. 
General Knox, who was his Friend, told me he had a 
dreadfull task, that was his Phrase, to get Washington 
and Hamilton to consent to his appointment to any 
Thing. Pickering in his Letter to Governor Sullivan 
acknowledges that Washington knew him, and that he 
told him when he made him Secretary of State that he 
had offered the Place to others whom he mentioned to 
Pickering but Pickering did not mention to the Publick. 
P conjecture Chancellor Livingstone and Mr. Madison 
were the persons.] 

Pickering however drudged on, as Postmaster and as 
Secretary under a President who could not spell, nor 
write Grammar, but yet would lie, till 1797 w^hen I was 
chosen P. of U. S. I had never had much intercourse 
with any of the Secretaries of Departments : but now 
it became my dut)' to look into them. Washington had 
appointed them and I knew it would turn the w^orld upside down if I removed any one of them. I had then 
no particular objection against any of them. I called 
at the Treasury and conversed with Walcott. I called 
at the office of State and conversed with Pickering. I 
was now elected and Washington, upon the Point of 
his Departure from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. Pickering to my 
utter astonishment began to talk about Washington in 
the same strain as in Mrs. Keppeles house, six or 
seven years before. He said " Washington was so extremely illiterate ! He could not write a sentence without mispelling some word ; nor three parrtigraphs without false grammar." I was displeased at this ill nature, 
and astonished that after so many years service under 
Washington he should have retained the same malevolence and Contempt which he had indulged so foolishly in my presence six or seven years before. I took 
no other notice of his Indiscretion, however than to say, 
with the utmost mildness ** Col. Pickering you seem to 
me to be too much prejudiced. Washington certainly 
was not so extremely illiterate as you represent him : his 
Letters and publick performances shew him quite otherwise. Pickering replied very sharply " He did not write 
them." I asked who did? He answered " His Aids 
and Secretaries ; in the Army his Secretaries and aitls 
wrote his Letters ; the best of them were written by 
Colonel Harrison etc." I said from all the conversations I had held with him from the year 1774, he 
appeared to me to have a good deal of Information. 
** Information !" said Pickering •* he had never read any 
Thing ; not even on the Military Art ; he told me he 
had never read any Thing but [I forget what, probably 
Sim's Military Guide] He never had read Mullen*' 

This is the Colonel Pickering, who is now holding 
himself up, as the Friend and Admirer and Lover of 
Washington ; a Member of the Washington benevolent 
Societies, affiliated with Societies under the same appellation, and for the same purposes in Canada. 

This is the same Colonel Pickering who has opened 
his Tyger Jaws upon me in the Newspapers, and 
represented me to the Universe as having sacrificed 
him to a corrupt bargain with Samuel and Robert 
Smith. 

I do not stand on equal ground with Mr. Pickering. 
A President of U. S. cannot vindicate himself setting a 
dangerous example. I have written however to the

Friend of 1774, — When I sat down to write to you 
yesterday I really intended to write a sober Letter : but 
fell insensibly into my habitual playful strain. 

I will now try the experiment, whether I can write a 
serious Letter to you without anything sportive or extravagant in it. 

I cannot see with you that a declaration of War 
against France as well as England would probably 
unite us. On the contrary it appears to me it would 
divide us ; essentially and fundamentally divide us ; and 
end in a short time in a final separation of the States 
and a civil War. Instead of filling the loan, it would 
put a stop to it. Instead of either Nations feeling our 
importance it would convince both that they can do 
without us. It would alienate our Navigation and Seamen and make them all british ships and british subjects. In such a case we could trade with no part of 
the world. Our Navigation and Commerce would be 
annihilated, which would drive the whole Continent, but 
especially the Northern half of the Nation to desperaation. For they cannot, they will not and they ought not 
to bear it or submit to it. We want no " reaction in domestic manufactures or internal commerce" to ** make us 
a great and independent People." We are both already, 
and want nothing to make it appear to all the World, 
but common sense and common courage. We deceive 
ourselves if we imagine that our People will become 
sedentary and turn manufacturers. Where lands are 
so plenty and so cheap mankind will never confine 
themselves to close rooms, hot fires, and damp Cellars 
to throw a Shuttle or swing a hammer. Besides, if 
:ou once stop the exportation of Com and Flour, there 
KTOuld be so little raised, that we should often suffer a 
amine for bread. 

You ask my opinion whether a declaration of War 
igainst England last £ill, would not have prevented so 
nuch clamour against embargoes, loans .and taxes? 
ily answer is ready. There would in that case have 
&gt;een no embargo to excite a clamor: and loans and 
axes would have exdied none at all. Espedaiiy if 
Ton^ess had voted a few ships. Frigates i niean for a 
leginniag oi a Xa\y. 

You cannot conceive what rasre and horror was 
lashed through New England and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> by the 
rmbargo and uie vote against a few additional Frigates, 
rhey new like streaks of lightning and hurled Gerr\' 
rom his Chair, and revolutionised the whole State oi 
^kew York and the whole representation of Massachusetts- Had Congress only voted six additional Frigates 
ind the tanbargo kept back one week, Gerr\* would have 
wen Governor. These vxo egregious blunders of our 
latSonal Go^'emment produced an absolute tornado, 
rhe Furv of the Whiriu-ind M-as irresistabie It blowed 
iown Palaces and tore up aged Oaks by the roots. 

My confidence in the Integrit}' of Mr. Jefferson and 
At. ^ladison. in their love of their Country, and the 
iooerit)' of th^ desires to sene its interests and pronote its prosperit}'. is sdll entire Of their Genius, 
alents, learning, Industr}*, I am fully convinced, as all 
he rest of tiie World is. But either thev are shallow 
tatesmen or I am a natural FooL There is no other 
Jtemative or Dilemma. Mr. Madison has more corect Ideas : but as he has been borne up under the 
ring of Mr. Jefferson he has been alu^ys shackled uith Mr. Jeffersons visions and Prejudices. But, my Friend, 
as this is a serious Letter, I must soberly tell you that 
the Tories of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> are now retaliating 
upon Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Madison their own policy. 
I appeal to your conscience, and I say that you know 
that Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Madison, John Taylor, John 
Langdon, Frederick and Peter Muhlenburg, Tenche 
Coxe, Pierce Buder, Thomas McKean and others, 
without number and without Name and in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
Clintons, . Livingston, Gates, Burr, &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c, sett 
themselves deliberately to spread discontent among the 
People by which were raised Mobs, Riots, Routs, Unlawful Assemblies, Seditions and Insurrections against 
me as they had done against Washington before. 
This was effected by such a Series of Libels as never 
appeared in America before. 

The Tories of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> for twelve 
years past have been retaliating upon them their own 
Policy. An uninterrupted Series of Libels for eleven 
years to be sure have been poured from the Press 
against Jefferson and Madison, and at last Rebellion or 
Quasi Rebellion has been produced. An uninterrupted 
Series of Libels in like manner had been vomited forth 
against Washington and Adams during the first twelve 
years of the national Government and produced Riots, 
Routs, unlawful Assemblies, Seditions and quasi Rebellions, if not real Rebellions against them. Compare in 
old times Freneau, Church, Brown, Beache Duane, Paine, 
Callender, &amp;c, &amp;c, with the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Gazette Repertory 
Centinel, Palladium, Colmans Paper at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> &amp;c,&amp;c, 
&amp;c, and say whether the Motives and the means have not 
been equally honest or equally diabolical on both sides. 
I look upon Cabot Parsons, Chew and Willing, Jefferson 
[adison, Hutchinson Oliver and Sewall in the same 
equally honest, equally able, equally ambitious, and 
y hurried away by their Passions and Prejudices. 
\ Republican Party are now split into four or five 
ns, exactly as the Federal Party was in 1 799, and 
: same causes and the same means. The Disction is universal as it was then. I know you 
lever read my Defence and my Davila. If you had 
^ould see that it is always so. When a party 
strong and feels its power, it becomes intoxicated, 

presumptuous and extravagant, and breaks to 
. There is not now one Man upon the Continent 
id with the Conduct of public affairs, nor was 
one in 1 799. What will set us agoing again for 
\ years to come? [For it seems it must be a 
of Leapfrog. Once in twelve years the opposilust skip over the Back of the Administration.] 
t be Fate ? Will it be chance ? No : Neither. 
: must be <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, for there is no Man, no 
capable of it. 

.0 will be President? Mr. Madison? Mr. Jay? 
[arshall ? Chancellor Livingston ? Col. Pinkney ? 
lay ? or Who ? 

Madison I believe upon the whole : but if he 
lot repeal his embargo and Non Importations, he 
ive an angry stormy time, and if he does not set 
nest about raising a Navy, he will not live out 
f his four years in office. 

s is a sober Letter, by which an honest Man may 
entiously die.

Friend of 1774 and 1812, — I am Such a miser that I cannot suffer a Letter of yours to remain a day unanswered, because my answer procures me an Interest of 
eight per cent a month. I should have said such a shaver for that is now the technical term and signifies more than miser. 

I shall mind no order. You hope the new President, if there should be one, will send back your son, and I 
hope he will call home mine. We had flattened ourselves with hopes that we should see him in the Fall but this morning a Letter of the 4th. of March informs 
us that he expects to remain another Winter in the north, news which pierced his mothers heart and produced a pathetic exclamation that tortured, mine beyond 
all expression " I shall see him no more." Gracious Heaven ! avert the omen and defeat the Prophecy! 

If New Jersey and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, Pensilvania I mean, become disaffected, Maryland will follow ; for in that 
State the ballance at the last Election were very nearly on an equipoise. The Government must all come then from beyond the Potomac. How much Wisdom and 
how much energy will there be in such a Government? 

I know so litde of the World, that, far from knowing the high standing of Stephen Girard as a Democrat, I 
am not certain I ever heard his name. Is he a Frenchman ? a relation of the quondam Minister from France? 

The thousand Houses in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> will utter groans in the night and all day long from their empty 
walls against the late and present administrations of the Government. How far they will be heard you know best. 
Men are at War with each other, and against all 
living Creatures. Beasts, Birds, Fishes and Insects are 
at War with each other and with all other species. It 
is a militant state and a militant Planet. All animals 
take more pleasure in fighting than in eating. The 
Pleasures of existence are not diminished bv iL Since 
it is the destiny of our Globe and our Rank in the 
Uni\'erse why should a Philosopher repine? Storms, 
Earthquakes. Famines, Pestilences. Georges, Napoleons 
are but light anlictions and only for a moment- There 
is Philosophy for you ! And the only Philosophy that 
can make Men happy or can keep them so. Nil admirari prope res est una, Numi Solaque <i\i^ possit="" facere="" et="" ser\-are="" beatum.="" there="" s="" philosophical="" poetrj*="" for="" you="" ;="" which="" everj-="" schoolboy="" knows="" believes="" much="" as="" vou="" or="" i.="" colonel="" duane="" it="" seems="" was="" mistaken,="" and="" i="" am="" ver\="" sorr="">' for it. You and I respect and esteem and 
love Lan^TGon : but we both know that he is no comparlson to' Gerr\' in Talents, Education or Information. 
No Man exceeds Gem* in attachment to the Constitution or Administration. No Man has more ardor for 
supporting the Independence and Rights of his Country. No Man understands better the controversies in 
which we are involved with France and England, and 
no Man presides with more calmness, patience and EHgnity in Counsel, in the Legislature, and in the Executive Seat. Besides Langdon is rich. Gerrj- has sacrificed like all the active Patriots of the Revolution his 
Fortune. Family, Time and Prospects. He is moreover 
sei'eral years younger in age. though older in public 
service." 

It is indeed reported here that Mr. Langdon yrSX decline : but I own, it is so unusual for an old Man to 
resist the combined Temptations of Salary, Dignity 
and Fame, that I doubt. But if he should Mr. Gerry 
ought not to have been subjected to the Remark of the 
Multitude, that Langdon was preferred to him. It is 
one more of the egregious blunders of the present 
Congress. I am so weary of it, that I regret it has 
another Winter to serve. I am almost of John Randolphs opinion that no change can be for the worse. 
Yet if a federal administration should come in they 
would do no better : perhaps, and indeed I fear still 
worse. 

The sketch that I have given of all the Republicks of 
the World is but an History of our own. I called it 
** A Boudoir" in which dear Country might see and contemplate her own face and figure in every posture. 

Yours ut olim

Friend, — I will not lose an hour of my Interest of 8 
per cent a Month. I have this moment received yours 
of 2 2d. I could paper my whole house with such 
ornaments as Franklin wished for his study ; and from 
Persons who owed Offices, Fortunes and all their consequence to me. 

St. Bernard, St. Loyala and St. Dominick, and many 
other saints remain in the Calender and are worshipped, 
as well as Whitefield and Westley and with as mudi 
reason, while their calumniators are forgotten, My 
Parson Wibert asked Whitefield whether the Libels 
against him in the Newspapers and pamphlets did not 
hurt him ? Oh no said W. if they knew how much 
pleasure they give me, they would not write them. 
Pope said These Things are my diversion. But Johnson says, the wrything of his Phiz while he read one of 
them shewed he was not sincere. 

I am at a loss for the sense in which the Devil is said 
to be the Prince of this World. This world with all its 
confusions and evils is much better governed than any 
Devil would govern it. 

I possess and have read a work in French in several 
volumes upon the subject of great events from small 
causes. The world is daily adding fresh examples to 
the Catalogue. The Nomination of Mr. Langdon is 
a late one. You probably know that in the convention of 1787, a compromise was atchieved between the 
Northern and Southern States upon two points. One 
was the equal Representation in the Senate of the 
small with the great states; the other was the 
Representation of the Negroes of the Southern 
states in the House of Representatives. This bargain was conducted by Langdon at the head of 
the litde states, and by Madison for the Negroes, or 
rather for their Masters. In 1 793 Langdon, who had 
till then been an ardent Federalist suddenly shifted 
sides ; and his conversion was attributed to Mr. Madison, who it was currently reported had tempted him by 
the proposal to sett him up for Vice President in opposition to me. This Report was spread so far and wide, 
that our learned and ingenious, and in the main upright 
and well meaning Essex Junto Chief Justice, Theophilus 
Parsons told me here in this house in 1 793 or 1 794, that 
the knowing ones in Congress had informed the knowing ones in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> of the Fact, and ascribed to it, Mr. Langdons alienation from the Federalists. These two 
anecdotes shew a Confidence and Intimacy between 
Mr. Madison and Mr. Langdon of ancient date and 
long standing, and will account for the nomination of 
the latter for Vice President in preference to Mr. Gerrj-. 
I am sorry for this, because I am sure, that the one cannot add one half the weight to Mr. Madisons future 
administration of the national Government that the 
other would, at home nor abroad. 

Your parallel between public and private Insanit)' is 
a beautiful and most excellent moral and political 
Morsel. 

I care nothing for the little escape and accidental 
Leak you mention. But who is McCorkle ? and what 
is his paper ? I know nothing of either. 

Our Tories crow, but their tryumph will not be of 
great consequence. They will make a few Sherriffs, a 
few Clerks and Secretaries, and few Notaries. Public, 
and a few Inspectors of Fish and Potash, fly. 

It is uncertain whether we shall have any Electors. If 
we have they will be a chequered Body, a pied horse 
half black and half white. 

Had it not been for the embargo and the vote against 
Frigates Massachusetts, under Gerry would have been 
unanimous for Madison. 

In one of your Letters you say Cobbet was my 
ennemy. I believe you are mistaken. Some of his 
last Porcupines, and the Rush light in which I was 
abused as well as you, I have been informed were 
printed not by him but after he had given up the Paper 
to some British Tools. I know that not long before his 
departure he said to my Secretary " Malcom ! I solemnly 
swear to you, that excepting my own Father and my 
King, there is not a Man upon the face of the earth 
that I revere so much as President Adams.*' And I 
have been informed that he said and wrote not long 
after his arrival in England that " John Adams was the 
greatest Politician in the World/' These were extravagant speeches, but he could have no motive for the 
adulation, for I never in my life had any communication with him and never saw his face to know it. At 
present his friendship or his enmity for me, or mine 
for him cannot be worth a farthing to either of us. I 
have no use for Puffers. They can do me no good — they

Dear Sir, — Ask the great Lady you quoted in your 
last, whether when I pray for the health of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
and that no wasting sickness may prevail there, I make 
a Girlish or a coying compliment to Doctor Rush ? 

The next paragraph requires a graver answer. But a 
Volume would not suffice. Take a hint. I have lived 
among Infidel Philosophers more than half a Century, 
and been engaged in continued disputes with them. 
This has compelled me to spend more time in reading 
Universal History but especially Ecclesiastical History, 
than has been for my Interest or Comfort While the 
Result has been an increasing Love for Christianity, as 
I understand it, a growing Jealousy of the Priesthood 
has accompanied it all the way. Levites, Magi, Faquirs, Mandarines, Mufti, Druids, Popes, Cardinals, 

Archbishops, Bishops, Bernardines, Jacobins, Dominicans, Westleys, the Prophet of Wabash, or Tippecanoe, Nimrod Hughs Christopher McPherson, and 
even Priestley and Price, even Dr. Ewing, Dr. Rogers 
and Dr. Dwight, have conspired together to rivet to 
my soul the Duty and Necessity of Tolleration. 

These general assemblies of Presbyterian Divines 
are general Councils in embrio. We shall have Creeds 
and Confessions, Church discipline and Excommunication. We shall have the civil Government overawed 
and become a Tool. We shall have Armies and their 
Commanders under the orders of Monks. We shall 
have Hermits commanding Napoleons. I agree with 
you, there is a Germ of Religion in human Nature so 
strong, that whenever an order of Men can persuade 
the People by flattery or Terror, that they have Salvation at their disposal, there can be no end to fraud, 
Violence or Usurpation. QEcumenical Councils produce OEcumenical Bishops, and both, subservient Armies, Emperors and Kings. 

The National Fast, recommended by me turned me 
out of office. It was connected with the general assembly of the Presbyterian Church, which I had no concern 
in. That assembly has allarmed and alienated Quakers, 
Anabaptists, Mennonists, Moravians, Swedenborgians, 
Methodists, Catholicks, protestant Episcopalians, Arians, 
Socinians, Armenians, &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c. Atheists and Deists 
might be added. A general Suspicion prevailed that 
the Presbyterian Church was ambitious and aimed at 
an Establishment as a National Church. I was represented as a Presbyterian and at the head of this political and ecclesiastical Project. The secret whispers ran 
through them [all the sects] '*Let us have Jefferson, 
Madison, Burr, any body, whether they be Philosophers, 
Deists, or even Atheists, rather than a Presbyterian 
President" This principle is at the bottom of the unpopularity of national Fasts and Thanksgiving. Nothing is more dreaded than the National Government 
meddling with Religion. This wild Letter, I very much 
fear, contains seeds of an Ecclesiastical History of the 
U. S. for a Century to come. 

I recollect a little sparring between Jefferson and me 
on some religious subject, not ill natured however, but 
have forgotten the time and the particular subject. I 
wish you would give me the circumstances of the whole 
Anecdote. 

The similitude between 1773 and 1774, and 1811 and 
18 1 2 is obvious. It is now said by the Tories that we 
were unanimous in 1 774. Nothing can be farther from 
the Truth. We were more divided in 74 than we are 
now. The Majorities in Congress in 74 on all the 
essential points and Principles of the Declaration of 
Rights, were only one, two or three. Indeed all the 
great critical questions about Men and Measures from 
1774 to 1778 were decided by the vote of a single 
state, and that vote was often decided by a single 
Individual. Jumble and Chaos as this Nation appears 
at this moment, I never knew it better united. It is 
always so. The History of the World is nothing but 
a narrative of such divisions. The Stuarts abdicated 
or were turned out and William came in by one or two 
votes. I was turned out by the votes of S. Carolina 
not fairly obtained. Jefferson came in by one vote, 
after 37 Trj'^als between him and Burr. Our expedition against Cape Breton and consequent Conquest of 
Louisburg in 1745 which gave peace to the World was 
carried in our House of . Representatives of Massachusetts by one single vote. The abolition of old Tenor 
in 1 750 was decided by one vote. What is more awful 
than all. The Trinity was carried in a general Council 
by one vote against a Quaternity : the Virgin Mary 
lost an equality with the Father, Son and Spirit only 
by a single suffrage. All the great affairs of the World 
temporal and spiritual, as far as Men are concerned in 
the discussion and decision of them are determined by 
small Majorities. The Repulsion in human nature is 
stronger than the Attraction. Division, Separation are 
inevitable. My Boudoir, which you sometimes honour 
with your recollection is but an exemplification in all 
ages and Nations of this repulsive Power. I know 
not whether you have ever seen a Boudoir. I never 
heard of one in G. Britain or America. I had two of 
them in my House at Auteuil, which was nothing less 
than the magnificent Hotel de Rohan. A Boudoir is a 
pouting Room. The Idea is. when the Lady has the 
vapours, and is a little out of health or humour she may 
retire to a Bath in the Centre of this apartment and 
contemplate her own Face and figure in every possible 
direction and position, rill the sight of her own irresistible Charms shall restore her good opinion of herself, 
and her usual gaiety and good humour. The Room is 
an Octagon. Eight entire and imaculate French Mirrors extending from the floor to the Ceiling compose 
the eight sides. The Ceiling too is one entire Mirror. 
So that the Lady cannot turn to any point of the 
Compass without seeing herself multiplied an hundred 
times, indeed ad infinitum. My Boudoir is such a 
room ; in which our dear United States may contemplate themselves and see their own defects as well as 
Beauties. I hope it will never be used to teach wanton 
Experiments, as it is easy to see the Ladies bathing 
room may be. As old Men are apt to repeat, I may 
have told you this story before more than once. By 
my Boudoir I mean the three volumes of ** Defence" 
and a fourth volume as an Appendix called ** Discourses on Devils." 

When I hear a Man boast of his indifference to public Censure, I think of Henry the 4th. A Braggadocio 
in his Army solicited advancement and command, and 
to enforce his Pretensions, he extolled and exalted his 
own Courage. ** Sire, I know not what fear is : I never 
felt fear in my Life.*' **I presume then. Sir,*' said the 
good natured Monarch, "you never attempted to snuff 
a Candle with your Thumb and finger." 

Let Mrs. Rush laugh at my Girlish Folly as she will 
[which I cannot in honor or conscience deny] I will 
confess and insist upon it, that your gende emolients 
feel more comfortable to my skin, than the Blisters of 
Paine, Hamilton and Callender. 

I have heard much of Washingtons impatience 
under the lash of scribblers, some of it from his own 
mouth. Mr. Lear related to me one Morning the Generals ripping and rascalling Phillip Freneau for sending 
him his Papers full of abuse. 

Many causes concurred to induce the Generals Resignation. 

1. His Ministers plagued him as they did me, afterwards. 

2. He could not get Ministers such as he wanted, to 
serve with Hamilton. Several refused, and he was compelled to take stich as he did not like, particularly Pickering and McHenry. This I know from his own Mouth. 

3. He knew there was to be an opposition to him at 
the next Election and he feared he should not come in 
unanimously. 

4. The Times were critical, the labour fatiguing, 
many Circumstances disgusting and he felt wear)" and 
longed for retirement ; though he soon found solitude 
more fatiguing, more disgusting, and longed to return 
to public Bustle again. Besides my Popularit}' \\-as 
growing too splendid, and the Millions of Addresses to 
me from all quarters piqued his Jealousy. The great 
Eulogium " First in War, first in Peace and first in the 
affections of his Country" was suspected by him and all 
his Friends to be in some danger. 

5. I believe he expected to be called in again after a 
four years respite, as he certainly would have been had 
he lived. I heartily wished he might live or had lived 
for that very purpose, and I expressed as much in my 
answer to the Senates address upon his death. 1 was 
then convinced we must have him or Jefiferson and I 
thought him then the least visionary of the two. Considering his Connection with Hamilton, I am now not 
so clear I was then right 

I must come to an end of my Letter though I shall 

never find an end of my Regards to Mrs. Rush or her 

Husband notwithstanding her just admonition to 

the incurable, incorrigible scribbler

Dear Sir, — The Decadency of Government is obvious through the World and it is tcJ be feared the 
cause of it is the general Relaxation of family discipline. 
It becomes you and me seriously to consider whether 
we have not contributed our share to this general evil. 
Within a few days my Rib had the boldness to say to 
me " When you write to Dr. Rush, you string together 
epithets and adverbs and substantives, just as the 
Boys string their Robbins eggs in long Rows in the 
Spring." Yet this exceeds but very little what yours 
said of both of us. Ought not some measures to be 
taken to teach these Ladies some reverence for their 
Lords ? 

This important observation however was not the 
object I had in view when I took up my Pen to interrupt you in your visits to your Patients. 

Some unknown one has sent me **An American 
View of American Affairs'* printed by Bronson. I 
wish to know the Writer. Some young Gentleman I 
presume, whose Pen has not ran long enough to glide 
with ease. 

The Pamphlet is full of fashionable larpia, to our 
infallible Guide : but this is not so surprising as something he says about me ; which, whether intended as a 
Compliment or a Sarcasm, required a degree of boldness very uncommon in this age. The decent Freedoms with Jefferson and Madison shew him to be a 
Federalist, but whether a Quaker or not, he is not an 
Englishman, at least if he has not put on a Mask. 
When I read my name in a Newspaper or a Pamphlet, 
unattended with expressions of Contempt or Malice, I 
esteem it an honour and receive it as a Compliment. 

It is astonishing to see how little the Policy of this 
Union is understood and how totally forgotten or misremembered is Its History. What does this Man mean 
by " the strong Features of my Character, which I im
pressed on the Counsels of my Country " ? The Prudence of an Individual is the Policy of a Nation. Self 
Preservation is the first Law of Nature to both. It is 
the first Duty of a Statesman especially of the first 
Magistrate of a Nation to watch and provide for the 
Preservation and Safety of his Country' in all her Interests ; her Agriculture, her Commerce, her Navigation, her Fisheries, all her Rights on the Ocean and on 
the Land ; nay I will add her Morals, her Religion, in 
some degree or other ; her Liberties ; and as indispensable to the preservation of all and every one of these, 
to preserve a National Consciousness of her own Rights, 
a National Feeling of her own Power, a National Resentment of National Wrongs and Injuries. 

France, under Washingtons Administration, had, in 
defiance of all Laws human and divine, plundered our 
Commerce in every sea in Europe and the West Indies, 
she had insulted us to our Faces, she had invaded your 
Delaware River and taken our ships there, she had 
entered the harbour of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, S. C. and burned a 
ship with five hundred Tons of sugar at Noon Day in 
sight of the World. She had plundered our Ships and 
Cargoes to more than twenty Millions of Dollars in 
value. When these Injuries were felt, and an Ambassador sent by Washington to remonstrate against 
these outrages, that Ambassador was rejected with 
Contempt. When Washington slipped his Neck out 
of the Collar and left me to inherit his Contentions 
and his Ministers and I sent a new Embassy of three, 
Pinckney, Gerry and Marshall, these were rejected 
with Contempt, and worse than Contempt. Attempts 
were made to terrify them as if they had been Children ; demands were made of them of insufferable

Dear Sir, — If I were as rich as Mr. Stephen Gerard 
or Mr. William Grey, I would publish and proclaim 
offers and promises of Rewards in Gold and Silver, in 
Money and in Medals, for the best essays on several 
subjects, some of which I will now hint without any 
regard to arrangement. 

1. ICO Dollars or Eagles if I could afford them and 
a Gold Medal for the best History of our American 
Navy and its exploits as well as of its rise and progress 
in 1775, 6, 7, ?, 9, 1780, 1, 2 and three. 

2. Ditto for the best Histor&gt;' of the American Na\y 
in 1797, 8, 9, 1800, iSoi, 1802. 

3. For the most compleat Histor)- of Gallatins Insurrection, its rise, progress, decline and suppression. 

4. Ditto for the best Relation in detail of the Motives, 
::auses, views, designs and actions in Fries's Insurrection ; and of the Measures civil, political, militar)- and 
judicial employed to suppress it. 

5. Ditto for the most exact, impartial and intelligible 
Comparison between these Insurrections, their Causes, 
Conduct, Suppression and consequences. 

6. Ditto for the best Histor\- of the Friendship and 
Benevolence of Great Britain towards America from 
the year 1600 to 1774. 

7. An hundred thousand eagles for a true History 
of the American Revolution. 

These are but a few of the generous projects I have 
in contemplation, but I will not trouble you with too 
many at once. I pray you to suggest to me such subjects as want and merit encouragement, that when I 
shall be worth half a Dozen million I may give full 
scope to my benevolence. I will appoint John Jay, 
Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Rush, the Judges. 

I believe with you that Wars are the natural and unavoidable effect of the constitution of human Nature 
md the fabric of the Globe it is destined to inhabit and 
to rule. I believe further that Wars, at times, are as 
necessary for the preservation and perfection, the 
Prosperity, Liberty, Happiness, Virtue and independence of Nations as Gales of Wind to the Salubrity of 
the Atmosphere, or the Agitations of the Ocean to 
prevent its Stagnation and putrifaction. As I believe 
this to be the constitution of God Almighty and the 
constant order of his <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, I must esteem all the 
speculations of Divines and Phylosophers about universal and Perpetual Peace, as short sighted frivolous 
Romances. 

Your Reflection in your Yard of Insanity, reminds 
me of mine in the Royal Menagerie at Versailles, viz. 
What should a Man say to this Assembly of Birds and 
Beasts, if he had thoughts of recommending to them 
the Institution of a Republican Government by universal suffrage ? Just the same as he could rationally 
say to the same number of Frenchmen taken at random 
or by choice from the Court, the City, the Country, the 
Army, the Navy, the Merchants, Tradesmen, Farmers, 
or the Sorbonne or the Church. The Project of a Republican Government in France was often suggested in 
conversation even there and occupied much of my 
thoughts during the whole time I was in that Countrj'. 

In my Letter of the 3rd. of this month I have corrected a Mistake of your Pen or Memory. It was 
Hillsborough not Grenville who expressed the Jealousy 
of American Canvas and Tars. 

I have not calculated with precision enough yet to 
resolve the Theorem whether the Banking Capital does 
not exceed the value of the Fee Simple of the United 
States. 

The Sunday before last I went to the next Town to 
Church, our Minister having gone to the Funeral of his 
Brother. A Mr. Shelden, the occasional Preacher one 
of our ardent spirits in Pulpit oratory told us that 
"Awakenings" and ** Revivals" produced great divisions 
in Society. They set Fathers against Sons, Mothers 
against Daughters, Brothers against Brothers, Sisters 
against Sisters, Neighbour against Neighbour and 
Friend against Friend. 

Wars do as much of this as Revivals or Awakenings, 
and I believe as innocently and piously. Your Family 
is peculiarly situated : but I doubt not every Branch of 
it will perform its duty with honor and Integrity. 

Our Massachusetts and Connecticut are a little out 
of humour and are retaliating upon Virginia and Pensilvania in 1798 somewhat grossly: but the little eddy 
in the Atmosphere will dissipate and whirl away. A 
vote to build a few Frigates would blow it off at once. 

I have made my sons and Daughters sing " There i.s 

no Comfort in the house when my good Girls awa" 

these thirty years. It is one of the best Morsels of 

Poetry that ever was conceived. 

Adieu.

Your Letter of the 8th., my dear Friend is pleasing and it is painfull to me, in a high degree. 

You are not less allarmed than I am gricrved, at the opposition to the general Government in our State. But I am more allarmed and grieved at the Apologies 
furnished for it by that general Government in their Stupid embargo and their wicked refusal to build a few more Frigates. 

You will daily read more and more of the Rage of 
New England and perhaps <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. The real Object is a Change of President. The Means they employ 
are exactly those of Virginia and Pensilvania in 1798 and nine. If they succeed, what then ? Truth, Honour, Justice will say 

Nee Jus est justior ulla 

Quam necis artifices arte perire sua. 

You may think that personal Feelings dictate these 
Reflections. God forbid. My personal Feelings are 
of no more weight with me, in such circumstances of 
the public, than the feelings of a Rosebug, that I daily 
crush between the Thumb and finger of my leather 
Glove. 

You say the physical force of my State equals that 
of yours. This is conceding too much in one sense. 
Your Numbers are superiour ; your Wealth is at least 
equal, I believe superiour. You have Knowledge and 
Talents at least equal, perhaps superiour, among you. 
What then ? 

Bring the Massachusetts and Pensilvania into Collision and Conflict, at the present moment, and we 
would drive you to the Mississippi and drown you in 
the River. 

How can this be? you will say. I will tell you. 
You are as brave as we are. I doubt it not, and as 
honest. What then. We have — System ; we have 
method ; we have order ; we have more than one hundred thousand free thinkers and free voters ; we have 
Preparation ; we have a Militia, organised, disciplined; we have Cavalry and In^try; Horse, foot and 
dragoons; and we have ArtiIIer&gt;': one hundred and 
thirty seven brass Field Pieces belonging to Companies 
of Artillery scattered through the State, stand recorded 
in the legal official Returns to the Legislature. Nay 
the two immortal Pieces, christened the Hancock and 
Adams, the only ones we possessed in 1 775 are still 
ready to pour forth their muttering and complaining 
Thunders in case of need. Our Militia have arms and 
uniforms, and System. WTiat have yours ? You had 
better not compel New England to re\'eal herself to 
herself. You had better not compell New England to 
reveal herself to her Sister States. You had better 
not compell her to reveal herself to the World. If you 
do, you will find something of which you and the Continent and the World have at present no Idea. 

With you, I think the present War with Great Britain 
just and necessary : and with you I am determined to 
stand or fall with the National Government. The War 
will be as ruinous to me as to you. I could easily shew 
you in what manner. But as I have sacrificed ever)* 
Thing to the Union through my whole Life, I shall not 
depart from that Principle at present. Intimate as we 
have been vou know but litde of the sacrifices I have 
made to that great Object. You have advised and 
urged me to write my own Life. I shall never do it. 
But if I should attempt any sketches they shall be 
addressed to vou. 

But suppose New England and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> should 
prevaQ and turn out Mr. Madison as Mr. Madison and 
Mr. Jefferson turned me out in i8oa WTiat wiU follow ? Suppose they get Mr. Jay for President and Mr. Clay for Mce President, what will they do ? Will they acknowledge the sovereignty of die seas in G. Britain ? 
Will they acknowledge die British Doctrine of Blockades ? Will they acknowledge the Right of Visitation, 
Search and Impressment of Seamen ? Will dicy give 
up the Claim of Compensation for two or three hundred vessels piratically taken and piratically condemned 
by their Puppet tool of a Judge of Admiralty deciding 
against the Law of Nations in obedience to usurping 
orders in Council ? 

Oh dear ! thus far had I written when caUed down to 
breakfast I beheld by the side of my Bowl of Chocolate 
your Letter unsealed of the 13th. I swaUowed its Paragraphs between every two spoonfuls, and it made me 
forget War, Politicks, Parties, Factions and every Feeling of ill nature. I never read a Letter from you with 
so much pleasure. And I am sure I cannot invent 
a stronger expression. You shall hear more of this 
Letter. But not now. I will return from this digression to my first subject 

What measures will the new administration that is to 
turn out, Mr. Madison adopt and pursue ? Can they 
make a Peace with England, without Humiliations and 
Concessions, surrendering the Rights of Nations, and a 
very important part of our national Sovereignty and 
Independence? I am confident they cannot. And 
will this proud Continent submit to such disgrace ? I 
feel that it will not Will this virtuous Nation be guilty 
of such Wickedness ? Can this honest People conunit 
such Knavery and Treachery? Can generous souls 
think of such baseness ? 

Again, can we submit to all this Infamy, without incurring a certain War with France and all her AHies? 
The bebritished Party would meet this consequence 
with Joy. But will the People of America ? I begin to 
doubt my own Judgment in every Thing ; but either 
I have no sense, or the American People have more 
sense and more honesty dian to exchange a War with 
Britain for a War with France and all her Allies. 

A northern Confederacy would excite and compel a 
southern Confederacy. A northern Alliance with Britain would compel a southern Alliance with France. A 
southern Alliance widi France would cede Canada to 
France. A French Standard once erected in Canada, 
and the Canadian French would do the Business. 

My northern Brothers must see this. They can 
mean nothing but to turn out Madison. In this I hope 
and believe they wfll not succeed. They may also 
mean to get a Navy. In this I hope they will succeed. 
They must, they shall succeed. A Navy of Privateers 
at least Our northern states will fit out Frigates and 
seventy fours for Privateers, rather than not have a 
maritime Protection, if the War continues. 

In 1775 &amp;C. the Flames of Charlestown and Falmouth 
and in subsequent years the Prison Church .of New 
York and the Prison Ships would have set fire to a 
marble Statue or a Palace of Ice. There will very 
soon be inflammation enough. Fredericks Reason was 
like Crom wells, Napoleons and Hamiltons. It was as 
confused as the Logos of Plato, the Ratio of Manilius, 
or the Reason of Tom Paine, and the human mind of 
Condorcet 

You are the "Friends of Peace?" And who is 
not? Would they Apostatize from the Law of Nations, acknowledge a Despotism on the Ocean, acknowledge the K. of England's Proclamation for visiting 
and seardiing ships for the purpose of impressing Men, submit to Paper Blockades of the whole Globe, give up 
the unnumbered Millions of Property piratically plundered, soUicit the Protection of the British Navy, form 
an Alliance offensive and defensive with that power 
and declare War against France. Nothing short of all 
this will procure Peace with Great Britain at present 
Is your Bar ready to subscribe to all this ? Those who 
conceive hopes from a Change of Ministry in England 
are deceived. They know not the Character, the 
dominant Passions of the English Nation. 

I thank you for Mr. Ingersols Oration, whose eloquence, and Sentiment and Prophecies are very fascinating to my Feelings. The Panegyric on the Controllers Oration in the Newspaper is no surprise to me. 
I expected as much, and expect more still from the 
Pamphlet when I can obtain it Richard has the true 
fire of the Flint. He is a genuine Branch of the old 
stock. 

I have overlooked, perhaps the most important Point 
in your Letter, to wit the Sin that has proved displeasure and brought down the Judgment of War. 
The Sins are many; Whiskey, Banks, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., 
&amp;c., &amp;c. ad infinitum. But if there is any Thing in 
Morality or Religion, the Injustice, the Ingratitude and 
the Hypocrisy to which you allude must be one black 
bead in the long rosary. 

Did you ever visit Passaick River ? Your Daughter 
has no doubt seen Niagara. The dashing and washing 
and Roaring of the Word Washington ! Washington ! 
Washington ! deafens, stuns and confounds multitudes who are spectators or within hearing. How 
many Young Ladies and Young Gentlemen? how 
many Old Ladies and Old Gendemen have been predpitated down this Cataract from sheer dizziness as 
&amp;tally as the beautiful Mrs. Cummins down the Falls 
of Passaick? 

There is no distinction of Parties here. Republicans 
and Federalists are equally guilty. There is not however one Man of sense in either Party who is sincere 
in this Idolatry. It is all pure Hypocrisy. Every one 
of them knows that Washington was neither Pilot, 
Steersman, Sailing Master or real Captain. 

I have passed over another point in this or some 
former Letter. You teach your Family that there is 
no Religion in France, but much in England* Here I 
differ. There is according to all my observation as 
much Religion and Morality in France as in England. 
There is as much Atheism, Deism, Pyrronism and every 
species of Infidelity in England as in France.

Dear Sir, — Your delightful Letter of the 13th. received yesterday now in turn must receive my grateful acknowledgements. 

Is it a dream ? Or is it Biography ? When I write 
my Life in obedience to your Commands, I ought to 
insert in it the Anecdote, that once upon a time I had 
the Pleasure and the honour, in your and your Brothers 
Company, and at the Invitation of both, to make a visit 
to your amiable Mother, at the House and Farm as I 
suppose, which you revisited on the 1 1 th. of this month. 

I am a Hopkintonian — in part — So was Fenelon ! 
So was Bishop Butler. See his sermons and his preface. So was Hutchinson the Scott: so was unkle 
Toby ; at least he felt it, if he did not think much of 
the Theory. 

What do you mean, you will say, by all this Mystic 
Talk ? I mean that I believe in the Doctrine of disinterested Benevolence. And as sincerely as Dr. 
Spring of Newbury Port Your Feeling at that House 
and on that Farm were pui;e disinterested Benevolence. 

What are the feelings ? the sensations ? the Reflections, in your Letter. "These, fair Creature, are thyself.** The Feelings of Nature ; Feelings which Nature 
irresistably excites ; Feelings which our maturest and 
most deliberate Reason approves ; Feelings which our 
consciences authoritatively command us to love ; Feelings in which we exult ; Feelings which we are intuitively, I may say instinctively certain that God and Man, 
Angels and purified Spirits must approve and applaud ; 
Feelings which make us delight and glory in existence, 
and ardendy wish and pray for Immortality. 

What a F6nelonian ! says Bossuet. Pope ! bull him to 
excommunication, and the Flames ! What a mad rant 
of enthusiasm, says Diderot and Condorcet What 
Idiots and Lunadcks are Diderot and Condorcet say I. 
And here the account is ballanced. How superstitious! 
say Hobbes Mandeville and Rochefaucault. What unfeeling Brutes ! What stupid Blocks or unprincipled Villains were Hobbes Mandeville and Rochefaucault ! say I. 

Nature has ordained that early impressions on our 
Minds should be durable. The Ideas and the sensar 
tions acquired and felt in the Cradle, in the arms of our 
Mothers, and on the Knees of our Fathers, as well as 
those afterwards acquired at school and at CoUedge 
seldom leave us till we die. 

All affections £or others ; for Father, Mother, Son, 
Daughter, Neighboiir, Friead, Country, are Benevolence ; disinterested Benevcdence. 

But I hare given you Paradoxes enough for one 
letter. 

After all, my Friend, what a Damper ? These Fedtngs are the souroes, the springs, the Princi{des of Aristocracy and Nobility among Negroes and Indians, 
Tartars and Arabs, Chinese and Hindoos, Russians 
and Germans, Italians and Moors, Germans and Hungarians, French, English, Spaniards and PcMtuguese; 
nay among our poor, degraded, divided, distracted 
States of America ! If a little of Politicks creeps in, 
I cannot help iL I did not seek it, I did not think of it. 
It rushed in with the subject. 

Retaliation, the old Jewish Doctrine of an eye for an 
eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth, has revived and taken 
possession of the Worid for a time. I shall take advantage of the Fashion so tu* as to retaliate upon 
you, your Family History. I would give more money 
than the circumstances of my Family could afibrd for 
such a Family History of my Friend jay. Such Families are for a Time the salt of the Earth, and in their 
course become its Poison and its curse: Dios d^etdioto 
Boulee. I have not Time to look in Homer for the 



Henry Adams a congr^;ational Dissenter finom the 
Church of England persecuted by the intc^erant spirit 
oi Archbishop Laud, came over to this Country with 
fiigox sons in the Reign of King Charles the first. One 
of the eight returned to England: seven remained in 
America and left Families, who by Intermarriage and 
natural Generation have multifdied like the sands on the sea shore or the Starrs in the Milky Way ; to such 
a degree that I know not who there is in America to 
whom I am not related. My Family I believe have cut 
down more Trees in America than any other Name. 
What a Family distinction ! have I not a right to glory 
in it ? There are however no Parchments to prove it 
and the Fact may be disputed. I do not therefore insist 
upon it 

This Henry and his son Joseph became original Proprietors of the Town of <a href='/results.php?city=braintree' rel='city'>Braintree</a> incorporated in the 
year one thousand six hundred and thirty nine, having 
previously settled near the foot of Mount Wollaston 
which was then incorporated with twenty seven thousand acres of Land in the new Township. This Henry 
and his son Joseph my Great Grandfather, and his 
Grandson Joseph my Grandfather, whom I knew, tho 
he died in 1739, and John my Father who died in 1761 
all lie buried in the congregational Church yard in 
<a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>, half a mile from my house. These were all 
possessed of landed Estates and all Tradesmen. They 
wrought on their Farms in Summer and at their Trades 
in Winter. All reared Families of eight, ten or a dozen 
Children, except my Father who had but three. All 
these Children were married and had numerous Families; and such was the effect of Industry, Frugality, 
Regularity and Religion, that Death was rarer among 
them than Men and Women of 70, 80, 90 and 96 years 
of age. 

You may suppose that we have as steady habits as 
the pious Folk of Connecticutt when I tell you that of 
all the Land that was ever owned by any one of the 
Breed is now owned by some one of the Name and 
Blood, excepting about ten acres of miserable stony 
land, which my Father was compelled to take for a 
Debt, and which he sold to defray part of the expense ^ 
of my education at CoUedge. 

The second House that was built by my ancestor on 
the original spot was taken down two or three years 
ago at the age of one hundred and forty years. The 
Land remains in two Men, direct descendents, of the 
same name. I would give twice the value of it, but I 
should as soon think of asking them to sell me two 
Pounds of their Flesh like Shylock. On their first settlement they erected a Malthouse pro more Anglicano, y/ 
which converted Barley into Beer for the whole Town 
and Neighbourhood. Many a time when I was a little 
Boy have I carried Barley for my Father to be malted 
by my Great Uncle, Captain and Deacon Peter Adams, 
who used to pat my Cheeks and pinch my ears and 
laugh and play and sport with me as if I were one of 
his younger schoolmates. 

In the month of March last I was called to the House 
in another part of the Town which was built by my 
Father, in which he lived and died and from which I 
buried him ; and in the Chamber in which I was bom 
I could not forbear to weep over the remains of a 
beautiful child of my son Thomas, that died of the 
whooping Cough. Why was I preserved ^ of a Century, and that Rose cropped in the Bud ? I, almost 
dead at Top and in all my Limbs, and wholly useless to 
myself and the world ? Great Teacher tell me. 

What has preserved this race of Adams's in all their 
ramifications in such Numbers, health peace Comfort ^^ 
and Mediocrity? I believe it is Religion, without which 
they would have been Rakes, Fops, Sots, Gamblers, 
Starved with hunger, frozen with Cold, Scalped by Indlans, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c, been melted away and disappeared 

Richards oration has been in such demand, snatched 
and hurried away from me by so many, that I have not 
had opportunity to read it by myself deliberately. 
That greatest Part of it has been read to me, by the 
oldest Colonel in the Continental revolutionary Army» 
now living; one who has commanded Wilkinson and 
even Brooks. The crippled Veteran cryed out " This 
young Gentleman makes my old Blood fly through my 
veins as it did in my youth/' Farewell.

Doctor Rush, — ^We have been in such hurry of late that if I have mentioned your Letter of 18th. of June, I have not taken any particular Notice of it 

You and I have both been to blame. You, for destroying your notes of the Revolution ; I, for keeping 
none and making very few. You have much Merit in 
preserving the Pamphlets you have given to the oratorical Controuler, who is a Phenomenon, for who ever 
heard before of an Orator, a Lawyer and a Mathematician and an Accountant, united in one person? I 
am much to blame for preserving no Pamphlets. I 
have been overwhelmed with such multitudes of them 
in America, France, Holland and England, that if I had 
attempted to preserve them I must have said as the 
Evangelist said in his time of the spurious Gospells, 
Acts and Epistles '' the world could not contain them." 
You were better employed in the service of your fellow 
Men, Women and Children. I was fully employed 
whether better or worse I know not I was very safe 
in bidding high for a true History of the Revolution, 
because I knew as you know that no true History- of it 
ever can be written* My Premium therefore ne\'er 
could have been awarded. 

I fasted not for strife. I eat nothing but half a 
small Pancake and a spoonful of green Pease the 
whole day : but went not to Churcfap because I knew I 
should hear notlung but the Gazette, Centinel Repertory and Palladium with something from the Pamphlet 
called " Mr. Madisons Warr/' But I will go to Church 
on the Fast for <a href='/results.php?city=concord' rel='city'>Concord</a>, but not to hear newspapers 
which I shall have read before. 

I devoudy believe in your ** Nill, Dii mortalibus, sine 
Bello." Your Sat&gt;T upon our Nation, though a moral 
Lesson, is too mean a scourge. You kish like an overseer, or a British Seijeant. 

I hate your "^ Non est ias, mihi audita loquL" I want 
tt&gt; know it alL 

In the Investigation of Principles, and the seardi of 
Springs, you have gone through as much labour, ran as 
many risques, and suffered as much hardship as Bruce 
did in pursuit of the Sources of the Nile. But you 
have done more lasting good to your Species, by these 
means dian he did. Your writings are worth much 
more than his ; and your Life has been mudi more usefull 

I would agree to every part of your Amendment of 
the Constitution. 

I suppose Miss L^-man meant that I have so many 
qx&gt;tts upon my Disk, that I must be removed to the 
distance of a fixed Starr before any Light can be distinguished from the dark. I wish that any pure Rays may ever be discemable. With all my childish Vanity, 
I have not an enemy that thinks more humbly of my 
Life than I do. 

Richards oration does honour to him and you, to his 
cause and Country. But I wish he had enlarged on 
one Topic. During the existence of the old Congress, 
during Washingtons Administration, during Adams's 
Administration, and during Jeffersons Administration 
for nearly seven years of it, the British Government 
never pretended to a Right of Impressment on board 
even our Merchant ships. They invariably cast the 
abuses upon the subordinate officers of their Navy. 
But in 1807 The King by an order in Council issued a 
Proclamation asserting his Right and commanding his 
officers of his Navy to visit and search for Men and to 
impress Men. When I saw that order in Council and 
that Proclamation I said it was a Declaration of War 
and ought to have been answered by a Declaration of 
War in Congress. I have been invariably of that opinion ever since. A thousand irregularities may be committed by individuals subjects or Citizens but when a 
Power avows a hostile Law and practice, it can only be 
answered and repelled by a counter Law and Practice. 
Protections! Certificates of Birth! or Citizenship! 
ought never to have beei&gt; granted or asked. The 
Flagg is sufficient to protect even deserters from the 
Royal Navy, in a private as well as in a public ship. 

Sam. Adams's Liberty ; was like the Liberty of Parson Burr of Worcester, an ancestor of Aaron : The 
Liberty of a Man chained hand and Foot in a Dungeon; that is a perfect Liberty to stay there. The 
Liberty of Stearne's Starling to flutter in his Cage, 
when he could not get out The Liberty of the Patient 
in your tranquillizing Chair. Sams Doctrine however 
is true ; and has a good tendency to excite Vigilance 
and Energy in defence of Freedom. The observation 
however was not original. It was not uncommon before he was born. 

One is always in danger of adopting an opinion 
that human Nature was not made to be free. No 
Nation has long enjoyed that partial and imperfect 
emancipation that we call a free Government. Banks, 
Whiskey, Panis et Circenses, or some other Frivolities, 
whims, Caprices, and above all Idolatries and Military 
Glories, Luxuries, Arts, Sciences, Taste, Mausoleums, 
Statues, Pictures, Adulatory Histories and panegyrical 
orations. Lies, Slanders, Calumnies, Persecutions, have 
sooner or later undermined all Principles, corrupted all 
Morals, prostituted all Religion ; and where then is 
Liberty ? Adieu.

P.S. — Col. Smith left us yesterday with his Wife and 
Daughter for his home in <a href='/results.php?city=lebanon' rel='city'>Lebanon</a>. They all carried 
with them Gratitude to you for your kind advice. After 
a year with us she has returned in good health. The 
veteran dwells on the scenes of War with as much 
animation as Uncle Toby and is as ardent to engage 
again. But, — I can blame nobody but him. — He is an 
Enemy to no Man but himself. 

August 3rd. Gracious God, hast thou abandoned us 
to our reprobate Minds ? Are we beginning a French 
Revolution ? What News did I hear from <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, 
at our Church Door yesterday? 

I will never cease to pour out myself to you. Speeches in Congress and State Assemblies and Town 
Meetings, Proceedings in the Legislature of Virginia, 
Libels of Callender Paine, Brown, Freneau, Duane, 
Austin and 20 &amp;cs. produced Galladns Rebellion and 
Fries's Riot and Rescue. Nor were your Presbyterian 
Clergy in the middle States guildess. What was the 
effect? I was turned out and Jefferson, Madison and 
Gallatin came in. Such success could not but encourage the practice. 

Now, Assemblages in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, votes of the Town, 
votes of the House, Speeches, Protests, Remonstrances 
&amp;c., &amp;c, &amp;c., and I must add Prayers, Sermons in 
which the Libels of Newspapers and pamphlets are 
adopted and repeated, have wrought up the spirit of 
Party to a Frenzy. And when Men are given up to 
the rule of their Passions, they murder like Weazells, 
for the pleasure of murdering, like buldogs and bloodhounds in a fold of sheep. Tell me not that the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Fever has not reached <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>. Who was Wagner ? A Clerk of Pickering. Who but Pickering first 
sett his Paper agoing ? Can you doubt that this was a 
Junto Plott ? Wagner I suppose expected to be made 
Secretary of State by Madison : but disappointed, he 
acted as disappointed ambition usually does, that is 
gives itself to Envy and Revenge. Steel expected to 
be Secretary of the Treasury : disappointed he became 
my enemy, but not having a patron like Pickering he 
did not sett up a Newspaper.

Your favour of the eighth, is another Monument to 
Virtue and Piety. I would rather have your Birth and 
descent than that of any Howard or Montmorency, any 
Bourbon or Austrian, any Guelph or Stewart. 

The Antifederalists, Democrats, Jacobins, Republicans 
and Frenchmen, for all these shades of Faction and 
gradations of Party united twenty years ago, to raise a 
popular clamour against me, for employing the term 
Wellborn. But I know not why such a phraze should 
be more odious or exceptionable, than well bred, well 
shaped, well formed, well made, well proportioned, well 
dressed, well fought or well written, well placed, well 
penned or well wrought, well flavoured, well painted, 
well drawn, well reasoned, well salted, well peppered, 
well cooked, well boiled, well roasted, well preserved, 
well pickled, well cured. A Man may believe with all 
Mankind, that there are distinctions of good, bad and 
indifferent in Birth and origin and descent, as well as in 
Beauty, Strength, Stature, figure, air, grace, Agility, 
Activity, Sense, Wit or humour, education, manners or 
morals, without advocating the senseless systems of 
Nobility in France, Germany, Geneva, Switzerland, 
Holland, Italy or England. • Tho' the last is by far the 
least irrational of them all, and even of those of Greece 
and Rome. 

Cheetham said "We Republicans respect Birth in 
Practice but not in Theory." This was Cheethams 
sense. I know not how any practice can be justified, 
that is not founded in some Theory, i.e. in some Principle. Our Friend Priesdey argued against Birth, because 
the Turks paid no regard to it. This when I read it, appeared to me like saying that Virtue was good for 
nothing because the Devil does not like it. Despotism 
stands on Wachusett Hill. All the World appears and 
is on a level below him. The tallest Poppies as well as 
the shortest must be mowed down at his Nod ; or he 
would soon be hurled from his Height. 

How is it, my Friend, that I, poor, ignorant I, must 
stand before Posterity as differing from all the great 
Men of the Age ? Priestley, Price, Franklin, Burke, Fox, 
Pitt, Mansfield, Cambden, Jefferson, Madison ? So it 
is. I shall be judged the most vain, conceited, impudent, arrogant Creature in the World. I tremble when 
I think of it. I blush, I am ashamed. But as I have 
Dr. Rush and one or two others to keep me in Countenance I hope I shall not be wholly reprobated. 

Butler and Barrow were the deepest Thinkers of all 
the Divines I have ever read in English. The latter 
had so clear a head that he was a Roman Catholick : at 
least as much as Burke or Johnson. " A clear head !" 
Aye. No clear headed Man ; no Man who sees all the 
consequences of a proposition, can be an orthodox 
Church of England Man without being a Roman Catholic : as no orthodox Catholic, who pursues his Principles to their logical consequences can refuse to justify 
Guy Faux, or the Massacres of Ireland or of Kadierine 
de Medici. The French Lady in Paris thought she had 
such a clear head, when she said, " Je ne puis pas suffrir 
les Protestans. Apr^s avoir avaler le premier chapitre 
de Gen^se, on ne doit pas s'arr&amp;ter a rien." In your 
proposed work upon madness, I hope you will give us a 
dissertation on clear heads. 

I object to your black Cloud. An infinitely blacker 
cloud hung over us in 1774; and an infinitely blacker 
cloud hung over us in 1797 when I mounted my Rosinante. Nay, a blacker Cloud hung over us in Shaises 
Insurrection, in Gallatins Insurrection, in Fries's insurrection than these flying heat lightening Clouds, that the 
Western Winds have brought over us. The Wind is 
now Northwest as it should be. We may have a 
thunder Gust and a Shower ; but fair weather must and 
will follow it that is as much settled weather as our 
Country, our People and our Government will or can 
admit. It is not the first time that this Country has 
been in a hurricane in the Gulph Stream. It is not the 
first time that Thunder or lightning have cracked our 
Mainmast so that we have been obliged to fish it. It is 
not the first time that three and twenty Men have been 
struck with lightening, four struck down upon deck and 
one mortally wounded. 

I acknowledge all the blunders you have hinted at, and 
a thousand more. But I say we do not make more mistakes now than we did in 1774, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 80, 81, 82, 83. 
It was patched and piebald Policy then, as it is now, ever 
was, and ever will be, world without end. The essential stamina remain and will remain. Health will be 
restored. The main Pillars are founded upon a Rock. 
Winds and Floods will not shake them. As I said to 
my wife 37 years ago in an intercepted Letter, You and 
I may rue. But what are you and I to 8 millions of 
People? what are you and I to the Family of Man. 
Great Britain demands of us Treason against human 
Nature. She demands of us the Repeal and Surrender 
of the Law of Nations. We project every thing, we 
conduct ever)' Thing, as well now as we did in our War, 
and we are now better united than we were then. Do you remember the Conduct of our War in Canada? 

We lost It there by the eternal opposition to it, and embarrassment thrown in the way of it, in Congress, and 
if we lose it now, it will be by the same means, and will 
be nothing new. 

Such is the Destiny of Man in his terrestrial existence that nothing good is to be obtained but by much 
tribulation. The overthrow of the horrors of papal 
superstition, and the introduction of religious Liberty 
in France, have been produced amid all the horrors of 
the last twenty years. May these Ameliorations of 
Existence never be lost. Remember our old Motto, 
Tribulatio ditat. We shall and we must be whipped 
and beaten into Wisdom and preparation. 

Can you think of an error more palpable dian to 
invade Canada without a previous preparation of a 
decided superiority of naval Force upon the Lakes? 
Recollect Hamiltons Threats of an history of Washingtons Battles and Campaigns. Recollect the Hospiul 
System ; and then talk of your black Cloud. 

The approaching election is the blackest Cloud that 
I see. I never could and cannot yet calculate the 
Eclipses of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and Pensilvania ; their conjunctions and oppositions : but one thing I know that New 
England must not much longer be despized, trampled 
on and trodden under foot. Adieu. 

<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">John Adams</a>.

Commerce must be protected. Naval Force for that 
purpose must be provided. — Or — ^fill up the blank with 
as many Clouds, Storms, Pestilences, Earthquakes as 
you will. Your inventive Genius, your creative Imagination can suggest nothing too horrible.

My dear Friend, — Little can be added to your distinctions of Principles and delineation of Parties, in 
your Letter of the 21st of August. Permit me, however, to intimate one idea. The pious and virtuous 
Hamilton, in 1790, began to teach our Nation Christianity, and to commission his followers to cry down 
Jefferson and Madison as Atheists in league with the 
French Nation, who were all Atheists. Your British 
Federalists, and your "Tory Federalists" instandy 
joined in the clamour ; their Newspapers and their Pulpits, at least in New England, have resounded with these 
denunciations for many years. At the same time, 
Great Britain has been represented as the Bulwark of 
civil Liberty and the Protestant Religion. All the pious 
Souls in the World are in England and America. 
Napoleon is Anticrist. The Milennium is near. You 
would be utterly astonished to attend one of our Federal 
Churches on a Fast or Thanksgiving day. Calvinists, 
Athanasians, Hopkintonians, Arians, Sounians, Priestleyeans, Horseleyans, Worcestrians, all most harmoniously agree in representing England as standing 
in the Breach in defense of Religion and Liberty, and 
Napoleon and the French as Despot, Oppressors, 
Tyrants, destroyers of Religion and Liberty, as sharks. 
Tigers, Wolves, Bears, toads, Aligators and Serpents. 

These things have affected and intimidated Numbers 
of your " American Federalists.*' 

At the same time, how shall we vindicate our Friends 
Jefferson and Madison ? You and I know that they 
very early read and studied Foumaux's Controversy 
with Blackstone, and Priestiey's Controversy with BlackStone, on the subject of Ecclesiastical Establishments. 
They read also Blackburnes Confessional. From these 
and Lock and Price &amp;c. they adopted a System, which 
they had influence enough to introduce into Virginia. 
They abolished the whole establishment. This was 
enough to procure them the characters of Atheists all 
over the World. I mean among the fanatical Advocates 
for Establishments, and these have been almost universally the fashionable Advocates, till very lately all over 
the Christian World. 

But how shall we defend this political Administration ? For my part I give it up. In every thing for 
twelve years it has been diametrically wrong. Their 
Friends (and I am one of them) will plead in their 
favour. Popular opinion, general sense, national sense 
and public opinion. If by all this is meant the opinion 
of a Majority of Numbers, throughout the seventeen 
or twenty States and Territories, it will not be denied 
But as such considerations never have been allowed by 
me to justify myself or reconcile measures to my own 
Conscience or honour, I cannot admit them in favour 
of Jefferson and Madison, any more than in favour of 
your British Tory, or Essex Junto's. 

As if Heaven spoke in Revelation to Jefferson and 
Madison in condemnation of their systems, this Week 
has brought us the story of the two hulls. Rogers has 
shewn the Universe that an American Squadron can 
traverse the ocean in spight of the Omnipotence Omniscience and Omnipresence of the British Navy. He 
has shewn that American Seamen can manage and 
maneuvre great ships as well as small ones. 

I am accused of having said, in the Beginning of this year, that the Government were beginning the war 


their zeal or suspected their luke-warmness for that 
essential indispensable Arm. 

You misunderstood me. I did not say that  Col Smith is still his own Enemy. Far otherwise. In total 
Retirement, in Agricultural Labour and incessant reading, his time is spent. His heart bleeds for his country, 
and burns to serve it. To you I will say in secret, 
what is Hull, what is Eustis, what is Armstrong, what 
is Dearborne, as Soldiers or as Officers, to him ? He 
is as sensible of the Justice and Necessity of this War 
as you and I are, and I fear more sensible of the improvident unskillful conduct of it ; because he understands the subject better than we do. I have no hope 
that he will be employed ; but it is to be regretted that 
such Talents, such Tacticks, such discipline and sudi 
experience should perish and be lost. But so it must 
be and I must be silent. He was not a sagacious 
Politician. He has been led astray into error by Chancellor Livingston, by Burr, and by Miranda. But who 
has not ? He absolutely refused to have any concern 
in Burr's Washita Project, and protested against it 

I long to see your Work on the Diseases of the 
Mind. Have you treated of The Demoniacs, the 
Maniacs, the Lunatics, the Epileptics, the paralytics, 
the Mysteries of the Old and New Testament? If 
you have I hope you have read Hugh Farmers essay 
on The Demoniacs of The New Testament. I read it 
with the greater Interest, because I have conversed 
with the very learned sensible, sociable, amiable and 
agreeable old Gentleman not long before his Death.

Dear Sir, — ^Will your tranquilizing Chair exorcise 
)emoniacks? Will it cure the Hydrophobia? I am 
ure our Country is possessed, — I am almost prone to 
ay, of the Devil — but Hugh Farmer, my quondam 
"riend, reinforced by Dr. Mead and his great Ancestor 
he Friend and Correspondent of Dr. Twiss, convince 
le that I ought to say only— of a Demon. 

If your Chair can cast out Demons, or if it can cure 
he Hydrophobia, I wish every Man, Woman and Child 
1 the United States were set in it long enough to heal 
hese diseases. 

That the Nation has one or both these distempers is 
nost certain from their abhorrence of a Nav&gt;^ and from 
heir beginning the War upon Land or Sea before they 
lad Army or Navy or Money, and before they posessed enough of the confidence and affection of each 
)ther to be able to procure either. 

The enclosed letter from Col. Smith will speak for 
tself. I pray you to return it by the Post. Shall I 
)ublish it ? in his Name and my own ? 

This Man, and Brooks &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., are neglected ; 
ind who and what is not promoted ? 

I know the sentiments of European officers concemng Smith's Military' Talents. There is not an Amerian officer living half so much respected by the British 
\rmy as Smith. There is none more esteemed by 
Vlilitary Men in any part of Europe, who have ever 
leard his Name. I will mention one instance. Count 
5arsefield, a \^ry learned and ingenious Man, greatly 
esteemed and admired in England and Holland, as well 
IS in France, a military Man from his youth, who was 
in the Battle of Minden and Fontenoy, who ranked high 
in the French Army, a scientific and a practical soldier, 
became intimately acquainted with Col. Smith. He 
told me he had conversed with him frequently, that he 
had sounded him thoroughly, that he had put every 
question to him that he could think of, on purpose to 
see if he could puzzle him. And he declared to me, 
that he never had conversed with an officer in Europe, 
who was more prompt and ready in his answers or a 
more perfect Master of every movement of an Army 

Iin grand or in detail. This Man is lost to his Country, 
and Hull and Wilkinson &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. are gained. But 
he is my Son in Law, and that is a sentence of eternal 
damnation against him in the Creed of all Parties. 
Pray return me Smith's Letter, without loss of time.

My dear Friend, — Your volume will not produce 
answers or examinations or refutations : but probably 
Reproaches, vilifications and Lies and slanders enough. 
For there are no greater Liars than Men of Science 
and Letters, Taste and Sense. Try this observation in 
the civil, political, ecclesiastical or rather sacerdotal and 
phylosophical History of Chaldeans, Egyptians, Jews, 
Greeks, Romans, Zingisians, Chinese, Tamerlanians, 
Indians, French, Britons, Italians, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., and you 
will find it true. Add Mahometans, Zoroastrians, Sanchoniathonians, Confucians, Druids, Bramins, Koulicanians and as many as you can have patience to hunt 
You will be accused of Materialism and consequently 
3f Atheism. They are all mad as I am, and we shall 
ill see ourselves in some or other of your Theories 
ind then we shall all call you a blockhead and swear 
Jbat we are as rational Men as ever existed, as an 
[nhabitant of Bedlam once swore to me that he was. 

Thus much concerning your rational Book upon 
Vladness before I see it. When it comes it will probibly make me rave a little more. 

But my dear Friend, let me add one observation in 
iie sincerity of my heart. The subject you have chosen 
s one of the most important, interesting, and affecting 
haX human Nature and terrestrial existence exhibit; 
md you will merit everlasting thanks of your Species, 
"or your attempt to investigate it, whatever your present 
success may be. 

You ask me for " Details of the Intrigues that led to 
the permanent establishment of Congress at Washington." I am not good at details.. My Patience has not 
enough of Marble, Steel, or Adamant in it. Summaries, 
Dr rather Hints are better adapted to my Capacity. 

Congress was scarcely assembled and organized at 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> in 1789 before Motions were made in both 
Houses to proceed to the designation of the Federal District, the Territory of ten miles square, the National City. 

One Proposition was to establish it at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
mother at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, a third at Germantown or someivhere in the neighbourhood of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, a fourth 
It Lancaster, a fifth at Yorktown, a sixth at some place 
Dn the Susquehanna River, a seventh at George Town, 
in eighth at <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a>. I know not whether Baltinore and Anapolis were not proposed publickly. 
rhey were certainly mentioned and talked about. But 
iie present site was favourable to the Fortunes of my 
Friend Carrol of Carrolton and to Washington and 
Custis, and their favourite as much as Fort Washington 
on Hudson River had been once before. 

Rhode Island had not acceded to the Union. Twelve 
States only were represented by 24 senators. The 
before mentioned Motions were all debated with great 
Zeal and at great Length. When the Question was 
put, Twelve Senators were in the affirmative and 
twelve in the negative. The Vice President must decide. I gave my opinion, in every instance promptly 
and decidedly in the negative, from the first Question to 
the last inclusively of both. This contest continued a 
long time from day to day. Never in my Life was I 
more tortured and agitated. Such a responsibility was 
a serious Thing. Hitherto I had heard all with close 
attention but said Nothing but No, No, No, No, No, 
No. At last I arose and asked leave to explain my 
reasons for the constant and persevering votes I had 
given in the negative, to every plan and project. The 
Speech was not short: but the Points that I relied on 
were — The Time was not arrived to define the Ten 
mile Territory or determine the permanent seat of 
Government. The Geography of the Country and the 
Centre of Population was not yet sufficiently ascertained. The Government was not setded : the people 
and the House were too much divided, as well as the 
Senate. No Census was yet taken. I was for an 
adjournment of Congress to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and for 
leaving to time and more deliberate Investigation and 
consideration to enlighten the Legislature before they 
should decide upon the subject. Upon this the question subsided and lay dormant for some weeks. 

Robert Morris, who was then thought to be infinitely 

rich, though I never believed him to be worth a groat 
if his debts had been paid, was extremely impatient to 
get to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. The Advocates for the Columbian 
district and the Washington City, entered into underhand Negotiation with Morris, and compromised ten 
years residence in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> for the permanent seat 
at Potomack, and were thus boosted up on their hobby 
by a single vote in Senate. Then Washington, Jefferson and L'Enfant, proceeded to plan the City, the 
Capitol and Palace. 

Though I was strenuously opposed to the whole 
system in every grade of its progress, yet Tom Paine 
has transmitted me to the World and posterity as casting my eye over the great City, its cloud capped 
Towers and gorgeous Temples and Palaces, exultingly 
exclaiming, is not this great Babylon that I have builded ! 
And I never had one Friend in the World to contradict 
the lying rascal : tho' hundreds were able to do it of 
their own knowledge. It was a great neglect and 
oversight in me, not to hire Puffers. 

I had the Anecdote of H's threat to write a History 
of W's Batdes and Campaigns, from you, who had it 
from Miranda. I know nothing of the circumstances 
that led to it. In general, I have always understood 
that Hamilton lived with Washington very much as 
Lady Teazle lived with Sir Peter, and as Lady Mary 
Wortley Montague lived with her Husband. 

Every word you say upon a Navy cheers my heart. 

Miss Dexter, three days ago requested me to present 
her grateful respects to you and your whole Family. 

I am, as always, yours

Dr. Sir, — Letters ! What shall I say of Letters? 
Pliny's are too studied and too elegant. Cicero's arc 
the only ones of perfect simplicity, confidence and familiarit)'. Madam Sevigne has created a sweet prett\- little amusing world out of nothing. Pascalls Provincials 
exceed ever&gt;' Thing ancient or modem ; but these were 
laboured with infinite Art The letters of Swift and 
Pope are dull Frederick's to Voltaire and D* Alembert 
are sickish and silly. His adulation of Voltaire is babyish. He knew nothing of Homer or Virgil. He was 
totally ignorant of the Language of both. Have mercy 
on me Posterity, if you should ever see any of my 
Letters. 

But, majora canamus ! Last evening I dined with 
about twenty of our most learned, most scientific, most 
tasty, most opulent, and most fashionable Gendemen in 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, at Mr. Peter Chardon Brookes's. As I am incontestably the greatest Man [you know] in this part 
of the World, I am always placed of course, on the 
right hand of the Lady or Gendeman Host. The rich 
and honourable Mr. Thomdyke, a very well bred Man, 
really very much of a Gentleman, the great Rival in 
Wealth of my Friend Gray, was by the Master of Ceremonies placed next to me. When the most clamourous 
demands of Appetite began to be a little appeased, Mr. Thorndyke said to me " Sir," said Mr. Thorndyke to 
me, "you have been so long and so invariably the 
Friend and Advocate of a Navy, that these late victories 
at sea must have given you peculiar pleasure." The 
most accomplished, the mostfinished Courtier in Europe, 
you see, could not have more delicately touched the 
in my system the most susceptible of flattery, 
will easily believe, it gave a spurr to my vanity, 
my imagination on the wing, freshened and quick
my memory, and set my tongue a running with 
ity volubilit)^ I assured Mr. Thorn dyke that our 
d Conquerors had given me the most complete 
faction. That I contemplated them and their imal victories with the highest delight. " I thought," 
Mr. Thorndyke, '* it could not be otherwise ; but is 
t surprising, that our Navy should have been so long 
ected by our Government?" Nothing Mr. ThornI, that I have ever experienced in life, has given 

much constant astonishment, except the French 
&gt;lution and the universal enthusiasm in favour of 
Europe and America ; as the general insensibility 
lis Nation, to the importance and necessity of a 
il Defence, upon the Ocean always, and since the 
*ct of an invasion of Canada, upon the Lakes, 
e experience we had of its utility, twelve or fouryears ago," said Mr. Thorndyke, "and since, in the 
iterranean, and indeed in the Revolutionary War, 
would have thought, should have been sufficient to 
ince the Government." My surprise, Mr. Thorn: is as great as yours, that it has not convinced the 
e Nation ; but there seems to be a general dispo
1 to forget everj'thing that has been done at sea. 
liy," said Mr. T., '* I have a general notion that the 

force we had in the Revolution was beneficial, but 
s young and I wish we knew more about it: the 
ick seems to have very little information of its 
ory. 

an old Mans Garrulity, Mr. T., could be pardoned, 
uld give you a rough sketch. A Captain John 
Manly in 1775 offered General Washington to go out 
and take him some prizes. Washington dreading the 
responsibility and doubting his authority wrote to Congress. Silas Deane made a motion to commit the Letter. I seconded the motion. But Oh ! the debate, the 
opposition, the Terror of taking the Bull by the horns. 
However in spight of all the learning, eloquence and 
Pathos of opposition we carried a vote of commitment 
by a majority, though very small. The Committee 
were Silas Deane, John Langdon and John Adams. 
We met and unanimous, in an instant agreed and reported a Resolution, authorizing Washington to fit out 
a vessel. But Oh ! the opposition ! Oh, the tedious 
debate ! At last we carried it, by a Majority of one or 
two. Manley was fitted out and took Transports with 
Soldiers, Cloathing, Arms, Ammunition and the noble 
Mortar, which was called the Congress, and drove the 
British Army from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and Navy from its Harbour. 
"Oh," said Mr. Thomdyke, '*I have seen Manley, and 
remember the Story of the Mortar.'* The Mortar is 
still in being [I continued] and this success made our 
little majority more valliant and enterprising. We 
moved for a Committee to build, purchase, equip, officer, 
Man, provision, &amp;c, a Number of Ships of War. 
After an obstinate opposition and a tedious debate, we 
carried this resolution by our small majority. John 
Langdon, John Adams, Governor Hopkins, Richard 
Henry Lee, Christopher Gadsden were chosen the 
Committee, Silas Deane having been turned out of 
Congress by his State. We met every night, and sat 
often till midnight, and in a few weeks had a Fleet at 
Sea under Hopkins who went and took the island of 
New <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> and brought home all the cannon 

nd public property. We were now able to carry a 
ote to grant letters of Mark. But the opposition was 
till as eloquent, pathetic, and tedious as ever. The 
^rivateers and publick Ships were soon so successful, 
hat Congress grew bolder. Some of the Antinavalists 
rent out, and Robert Morris came in and proved a 
espectable Reinforcement of our Naval Majority. Congress now appointed a Committee of one for each State, 
.nd ordered Twelve new Frigates to be built at one 
ote. " Astonishing,'' said Mr. Thorndyke, ** six and 
hirty years ago!" **Pray, considering the present 
Population, Wealth, extent of commerce. Number of seanen. Naval Skill, &amp;c, what Naval Force could this Counry now produce in proportion to what you had then ?'' 
Twenty ships of the Line, and Forty Frigates, Mr. rhomdyke, could in my opinion, be now provided and 
lupported with less difficulty, and be less burthensome 
o the Nation, than our Flotilla was then. " I believe 
t," said Mr. T. " Why then does not our Government 
ixert itself in this way?" Why! Ah Why! said I, 
imiling. Why does not the town of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> exert itself 
low as it did then ! One thousand British Ships were 
:ondemned as prizes in Judge Nathan Cushings Court 
&gt;f Admiralty in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> in that War. " A Thousand ! 
ifou amaze me." Look into the Records of that Court 
ind you will see a thousand and odd. <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> was then 
ill alive. Privateering was in fashion. Now that rich 
ind powerful City has not a ship, that I have heard. 
Here the Colloquy ended. I was called to the Carriage 
to return with my Family to <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>. 

You ask ** Who is the Sackville, that holds the Lion 
by the Tail ? that holds the Patriotism and valour of 
our Country by the Tail? that has clipped the Wings of the American Eagle in order to prevent her spreading them upon the Ocean ? that has broken her bill in 
order to prevent her picking out the e&gt;'es of the British 
Lion ?" Shall I answer like my Countrymen ? Who 
has held France by the Tail ? WTio has held Holland 
by the Tail ? Who would have held England by the 
Tail, if she had been a Continental Power? The 
answer is the landed interest and its jealousy of the 
commercial Interest. The great proprietors in France 
are never satisfied with armies. They would multiply 
them without end : but will never suffer much to be 
done for a Navy. They love to serve by Land but 
hate to go to sea. In Holland the four inland Provinces 
would never vote for ships, unless the three maritime 
Provinces would vote for more Troops. The Consequence of their mutual Jealous}* has been the annihiladoQ 
of their Navj-. Army and Coun trj' too. We are going the 
same way. If this answer is not the point, let me ackl 
the southern and middle states held the Lion by the 
Tail the first 8 years of this Century and the nordiem 
are now holding him. If this is not particular enough 1 
will be more personal On the i6th. Jan. 1804 wrote 
to a Correspondent "I wish Jefferson no ill ; I envy him 
not. I shudder at the Calamities which I fear his conduct 
is preparing for his Countr}% from a mean thirst of Popularit)", an inordinate ambition^ and a want of sincerity." 

Madison was his pupil held the Tail of the noble 
Animal too long, and I fear has not yet entirely let go 
his hold. Thus I have answered your Question with 
more candour than prudence : and now you ought with 
the same sincerit)' to give me your sense of the quesdoo. 

I am forever your

Dear Sir, — ^Answer or rather acknowledge my Letjrs by half a dozen at a time. I have a number of 
necdotes to write you, more for the sake of having 
lem copied by my Females and recorded in my Letter 
►ook, than for any valuable use to you, tho they may 
muse you. 

On Wednesday 13th. of this month I dined with our 
ite Lt. Governor Gray, in Company with Vice Presient Gerry, General Boyd, Commodore Rodgers, Caplin Smith and Captain Lt. Crane and other officers of 
lie Navy. Dr. Griffin was our Chaplain. What a 
rroup ! The officers of the Navy all understood the 
iisease of the Mind in old age, so well as to acknowldge me as their Father, and I understood the mental 
isease in youth so well as to profess to be, as I really 
iras proud of my Naval Family. Nothing could be 
lore pleasant than this dinner of 30 or 40 Guests. 
Jut having engaged to bring a worthy old Gentleman 
.nd Lady to <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a> I was obliged to take French 
^eave at half after four, tho I should have rejoiced to 
tay till eight, and come home by Moonlight. 

The Conversation at my end of the long Table, was 

►etween General Boyd and Dr. Griffin across the Table, 

ipon the Propagation of the Gospel in India. The 

General thought it was not in the Power of Man to 

propagate Christianity in Indostan. The Divine 

.nswered, " I believe you sir : but the Spirit of God." 

The discourse between me and Boyd was upon The 

Vophet, Tecumseh his Brother, and the Battle of Tip
)ecanoe. I overheard a few words between Gerry and 

Vladam Gray that I will not repeat at present. Boyd said to me that the Indostans are a very good People, 
a civilised People, very different from American Indians 
and African Negroes. This I knew as well as Boyd or 
Griffin ; and farther I believe tho I did not tell either of 
them of it, that all the Cruelties of their superstitions, 
have not murdered half the Number in Proportion as 
the Inquisition in Spain and Portugal, in proportion to 
numbers and time : No nor half the Number, that was 
massacred by the Laws of England in the Reigns of 
Henry 7, Henry 8, and Queen Mary. Oh God ! May 
Christians recollect the Histories of Albigenses and 
Waldenses of and Peter the Hermit ; of 

Puritans, Anabaptists and Hugonots, of Jews, Moors, 
and Turks, before they attempt to propagate enthusiasm and Superstition over the Globe. 

On the 17th. I dined with a Neighbour, Mr. Marston. 
in <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>, with Commodore Rodgers and Captain Lt 
Crane, in a Family Way. 

Here I must tell you a story. A Poet introduced 
himself to Boileau at Auteuil, next door to my Hotel 
when I lived there, and asked leave to read to him a 
Manuscript Poem which he had composed with great 
care and labour. Boileau heard in silence. When the 
Poet took his leave, and went away he met some 
Gentlemen to whom he said " I have had an Interview 
with Mr. Boileau, and I find him the most sensible, 
learned, ingenious, sociable, well bred Man I ever saw.*' 
These Gentlemen repeated these Praises to Boileau. 
" Upon my soul," said Boileau, " I know not the Man, I 
know not his Name. He came, sat down and read his 
Poem. I said not one word to him, not even Yes or 
No. He thank'd me for hearing it, and went away." 

Rodgers and Crane cannot say as Boileau did, for 
they were very sociable and bore their part in conversation very civilly and discreetly. But I know not but 
they may think I forced upon them my Poetry too 
obtrusively. 

Before dinner, Marston observed that " Europe 
would be astonished at the Exertions of our Fleet." 
I answered, Perhaps the most enlightened Naval 
People in Europe would not be so much surprised at 
them, as we were. This was a cold damper to Marstons Compliment, which was not explained till we were 
called to dinner. 

At Table I took the Liberty to enquire and was 
readily reminded that I had appointed Rodgers, the 
second first Lieutenant in the Navy and Crane a Midshipman in 1 798, soon after Decatur. Marston said to 
me ** It must be a great Pleasure to you to meet your 
Children." You may well suppose that I was not insensible to this. My answer was quick and fervid 
enough ; I assure you sir, I am very proud of my Naval 
Family. I asked the Commodore whether he had ever 
seen Monsieur Thevenot, the famous French Chef 
d'Escadre, one of the most scientific and experienced 
sea officers in Europe ? His answer was, he had not. 
You may remember sir, said I, my observation before 
dinner, that perhaps the well informed Naval officers 
in Europe would not be so much surprised at our 
Naval Victories as we are. I will now give you some 
of my reasons for that opinion. In June 1789 I dined 
with M. Thevenot then Intendant of the Royal Marine 
at L' Orient with the officers of the Navy in that Port. 
The Admiral, or the General as the French call him, 
Thevenot, addressed himself to me and said, " Your 
Country is destined to be the first maritime Power in 
the World." I pretend not to prophecy what may 
happen in two or three hundred years. " Hundred 
years ! In twenty years you will be a match for any of 
the maritime Powers of Europe.** You surprise me 
General I have no such Ideas ; pray what can be your 
reasons for such an opinion ? ** My reasons are very 
simple. You have all the means and advantages. 
You have the best of oak and Cedar for hulks, the 
best Pines for Masts and Sparrs, Tar, Pitch and turpentine, Iron and Hemp, all within yourselves. You 
have many Seamen now, and the best Nurseries : the 
Fisheries are at your door ; so much nearer to you than 
to any European Power, that you can imploy them to 
greater advantage ; you have a considerable commerce 
already, which will spread every way, and be another 
abundant Nursery of Seamen ; and you have naval 
Architects equal to any in Europe.'* I know sir, that 
we have Materials and Seamen that may be employed 
in time ; but I did not know that our Architects could 
be compared to those in Europe. " I am told that your 
Frigate Alliance, in which you came here, was built by 
an American. I have been on board of her and have 
examined her in every part, and you may depend upon 
it there is not a more perfect Frigate either in materials 
or Workmanship, in our Royal Marine nor in the King 
of Englands service.** 

If all this should be admitted. General, which is more 
than I knew before. It will be a long time, before we 
shall think much about being a Naval Power. " What 
should hinder? What can be wanting?** The Will, 
General, if nothing else will be wanting. "The Will! 
How can the Will be wanting when you have so many 
advantages before your eyes !*' The great Majority of 

our People, General, love Land so much better than 
Water ; are so much more covetous of great Tracts of 
bare Creation than of extending Commerce ; so much 
more ambitious of cutting down Trees, building Houses, 
planting Orchards, &amp;c., than of military Glory by Land 
or Sea ; that untill our Country is filled up, we shall 
never think much of Power at Sea. We have already 
had full Proof of this. You can have no Idea, General, 
of the difficulty we had in Congress to prevail upon 
them to build the Frigates we have : — indeed to suffer 
a Gun to be put afloat ! 

I returned to America, remained three Months, and 
then was sent by Congress to Europe a second time. 
A crazy, leaky ship obliged us to seek the first Port we 
could find which happened to be Ferrol in Spain, on 
the eighth day of Dec. 1789. In a few days arrived 
in the same harbour a French Squadron of five ships 
of the Line from Toulon, consisting of an 84 and 80 and 
three 74 Gun Ships, under the Command of the Comte 
De Sade, who hearing that an American Minister was 
there sent me an Invitation which I accepted to dine on 
board his Ship with all the officers of his Squadron. 
At dinner, the Comte addressed himself to me, to the 
same effect and almost in the same words, that I had 
heard 5 or 6 months before from Monsieur Thevenot 
in L'Orient. Our Materials, our Nurseries, our Architects were all enumerated and the same Prophecies of 
our approaching commercial Grandeur and Naval 
Glory. The Comte concluded with an observation 
that I shall never forget, ** We have a Maxim among 
us Seamen, that with Wood, Iron and Hemp, a Nation 
MAY DO WHAT IT PLEASES." My answers to him were the 
same in substance with those to Monsieur Thevenot 
I might have added another Anecdote, but did not, 
to convince Rogers that our Naval Conquests might 
not surprise the most intelligent officers in Europe so 
much as they do us American People. I might have 
added that in 1778 in the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Frigate  Captain Tucker, we took a rich Prize in the English Channel, a 
Letter of Marque of fourteen Guns, called the Martha, 
Captain Mcintosh, after she had cutt our rigging and 
broke our main yard by a broadside. Mcintosh had 
served twenty years in the British Royal Navy ; several 
of them as a Lieutenant His curiosity was all alive 
to examine our ship and he was allowed freely to 
search every part. When he had fully satisfied himself 
he said to me, " I am astonished ! I never saw a more 
compleat Frigate ! There is not in the Royal Navy, a 
Frigate better built or of better Materials. The Guns 
in particular are better fitted and secured than any I 
ever saw in any Ship of War." " But," he added, with 
a sigh, "You are the rising Country of the World; and 
if you can send such ships as this to sea, you will soon 
be able to do great Things." 

You and I, Dr. Rush can now add to Th6venots and 
De Sades Catalogue of our Nurseries of Seamen, a 
more extended external Commerce, an immense coasting Trade, and a growing Navigation on our enormous 
Lakes and Rivers. Look to it, ye maritime Powers, 
that you do not provoke Neptune, by your Injustice, to 
feel the disgrace of his Empire, and transfer his Trident 
across the Adantick. 

I have an old Mans fear that I have told you these 
Stories before. But to such a lover of ^lis Country 
decies repetita placebunt 

I had much more Conversation with Rogers and 
Crane and all very agreeable. I must now afflict you 
with more gloomy Prospects. The inclosed Letters 
from Smith and Waterhouse, I send you without their 
knowledge. You must return them to me immediately. 
I am you Friend

Dr. Sir, — ^Yours of the 8th. is yet unanswered. I 
beg your Pardon for hinting, tho in jest, at any Antinovanglian Prejudice. I do believe you are as free 
from it as you ought to be, or as I am. Dearly as I 
love New England, I know it, and its faults. 

Your Idea of Pensilvania is perfect. In a few days 
you will see that I have been reviewing an old scene. 
In 1775, you will see how the Committee on Trade and 
on a Navy struggled. Debates, Delays, Embarrassments, Perplexities. In 1774 and 1775, when Congress first met, the delegates from S. C. were as 
patriotick, ardent, bold and resolute as those of Mass. 
Indeed their Constituents were so. But the moment 
they arrived in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, they were besieged and 
surrounded with Quakers, Proprietarians and Anglomanes. Israel Pembertons, Drinkers, Shoemakers, 
Aliens, Penns, Chews, Bonds, Cadwalladers, Dickensons, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. 

When armed ships came in Question, you can hardly 
imagine the opposition. My zealous efforts to promote 
a Naval Force were the most decisive and obnoxious 
Proof of my Design at Independence. We could 
carrj' votes but by small Majorities. Consider who 
were there. Mr. Duane, Mr. Dickenson, Mr. Willing, 
Mr. William Livingston, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., even my own 
Colleagues, Mr. Paine, Mr. Gushing were opposed to 
me. Mr. H. was President and was silent After the 
Business was established he became ambitious of stealing the Glory of it : i. e. of the Naval Armament S. C. 
were perverted by your Quakers and Proprietarians. 
Ned Rutledge was the most earnest, the most zealous, 
the most flippant and fluent of all the opposers. He 
boarded in Dr. Bonds House. Gadsden however was 
faithfuU found. Immovable as a rock : stable as the 
mountains. Such men are born for the Public not for 
themselves. But Rudedges, Middletons and even 
Lynch flinched. 

"They are now all powerful in all our monied 
Institutions, except one, in our Libraries, Hospital and 
University ; and possess universal professional Mercantile, maritime and mechanical Patronage." These are 
your Words applied to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> and Pensilvania. 
You may apply the same Words with the same Truth 
to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> and Massachusetts. 

Mistake me not. I do not allow Waterhouse more 
splendid Talents ; on the contrary I believe with Professor Silliman that Dr. Rush has done more lasting 
honour to his Gountry, and service to Mankind, than 
Waterhouse or even Franklin, Washington, Adamses, 
Montgomeries or Warrens. There is for you, vanity 
and all! Yet as Dr. Swift said of Arbuthnot, even 
Rush has his fault 

I have no Idolatry for Politicians or Warriours. Who 
would not prefer Hippocrates to Alexander or Demosthenes ? Every Discovery, Invention or Improvement 
in Science, especially medical science is lasting. Political and military glories transient as the wind, Solon 
and Lycurgus have passed away, and what good have 
they done ? It would be Republican Blasphemy to say 
that Pisistratus the Tyrant did more good than both, 
y^et History would countenance a doubt. 

Alass ! Defeat after Defeat ! I hope these Defeats 
mil teach us the Necessity of System, Subordination, 
Discipline and Obedience. That the entire Prosperity 
3f every State depends on the discipline of its Armies ! 
3y sea and Land. Our Naval Conquerors have proved 
:his to the immortal Glory of our Nation. Boyd alone 
[las behaved like a Soldier, I mean at Tippecanoe. 

Bainbridge's Laurells are as splendid at least as any 
md ought to have a glorious station in the Fleet upon 
the Stage in a late dream. 

Quincy's Speech had too much Indelicacy, Indecorum and Vulgarity — many Truths indeed. But I cannot 
igree with him or you in the Folly, Madness or cruelty 
in the design of the Canada War. The design was 
benevolent and beneficent to Canada itself. Our 
Blunders and Defeats have been greater Misfortunes 
to Canada and Nova Scotia than to us ! as Time will 
prove. The conduct of the War in the Legislature, 
The Executive and the Army I give up. But Canada 
and Nova Scotia must be severed from Europe, or we 
never shall have repose. They would have separated 
themselves in a little Time. Now the Lakes must be 
:ommanded in all events. May favourable winds waft 
y^our son Benjamin in health, wealth and fame to the 
Bosom of his Family and Country. So prays his 
Friend.

My Friend, — I lose no time in answering your 
Letter of the 15th., that my Confidence in your Love 
to your Country, the rectitude of your Judgment as 
well as your Intentions, and your Personal Friendship 
to me, is so entire, that you are at Liberty to make 
what use you judge for the Public Good, of my Name 
and my Letters. Personal and Local and State Reflections and Allusions, in which I have indulged myself to 
you, without reserve and almost without Limits, you 
will of course suppress. 

Yesterday I put into the Post Office a Letter to you 
directly. And another of four sheets of Paper, also 
directed to you. But under cover to John Adams 
Smith, Counsellor at Law <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, with orders when 
he had read it, to seal it with a Wafer, and send it 
under my Frank to you, by the Post. It relates wholly 
to the origin of our Navy. In it a Letter from Vice 
President Gerry is quoted, but carelessly omitted. I 
inclose it with this, and you may publish what you please 
of that too. But return it to me. 

Your Letter to Waterhouse I have sent to him this 
Morning by my two Grand Daughters. I like your 
Plann for him. 

There is no Intoxication, my Friend in the Foresight 
of the Tumble Bug. There is none in the Foresight of 
the Necessity of the Dominion of the Lakes. What 
are the Lakes to me ? What to New England ? Little 
more than the Caspian Sea or Lake of Geneva. But 
they are of infinite Importance to the middle and 
southern states. Without them there can be no security against the Indians ; to say no more. 

Winchesters Defeat is a dreadful! affair to Kentucky, 
Ohio, and all of us. But you and I and our Contemporaries have no Right to reproach the present 
Government or the present Generation. We blundered 
at <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a>, at Bunkers Hill, in Rhode Island, New 
York, Long Island, Staten Island, Haerlem Heights, 
Fort Washington, <a href='/results.php?city=fort lee' rel='city'>Fort Lee</a>, Brandywine, Germantown, 
Monmouth, South Carolina, Virginia, Canada ! Where 
indeed did we not blunder ? except <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a> and York, 
where our Tryumphs redeemed all former disgraces. 

My heart bleeds for the Frontiers, and much more 
for the unfeeling Insensibility which too much prevails 
in this quarter. Are we one Nation, or i8 ? 

Yours six times

My dear Friend, — Your Letter to Waterhouse inclosed in yours of the i6th. shall be sent tomorrow. 
With them came the News of the Hornets Glory. If 
our Nation had as much religion as Jews or Gentiles, 
they would consider these victories as a Revelation of 
the Importance and Necessity of a maritime defence. 
Lawrence is now enrolled with Hull, Decatur, Jones, 
Bainbridge in the Record of our Naval Conquerors. 
Immortal Glory to them both in this Life and that which 
IS to come, both in the Heroes and the Christians 
Creed. 

For Mercy's Sake dont let Mr. Cary see my Ribaldry 
about Mr. Tompson, nor my Oath about the Committee 
of Deane, Langdon and Adams. Pray tell me what 
Work Mr. Carey is about publishing. Do not let him 
see any of my Nonsense. If you or he can find any 
sense you are wellcome to that. 

Give yourself no concern to answer my Letters. 
Your employments are better and more important. I 
cannot bear to hear that examination of candidates is a 
dull employment. The honour to your Country and 
the everlasting benefit to this Nation ought to render 
the Fatigue itself sweet and delightful!. Your pupils 
will transmit science to theirs, to the latest Generation. 

The Tories are determined to destroy the Country 
as the Jacobins and Tories too were in 1 800 by stopping 
the wheels of Government. If the good were not to be 
ruined with the evil I would not much regret it But 
no Angel will warn Lott out of Town. Indeed where 
can he go ? He must sink or swim with the Government and Nation with all the faults of both. 

It is a lamentable Thing that so litde of the Talent 
and experience in War, which remains in the Country 
has been called into service. 

Yours ut supra

My Friend, — Inclosed is a Packet. Two Papers 
marked A. B., four Numbered i. 2. 3. 4. A Letter 
from the Vice President and one from Mr. Austin to 
him, 8 documents in the whole. Considering your engagements it hurts me to trouble you with the Reading 
of these Papers ; but you will be so amused with them, 
that you would have reprehended me if I had suppressed 

them. If any of them fall within Mr. Careys Plan, he 
is welcome to use them : but in all events I insist in 
having all these Papers returned to me. Selman shall 
not be unknown to Posterity. Nor shall it be unknown 
with what metaphysical and mathematical Precision 
Congress, Massachusetts, and Washington, conducted 
our Quasi War with Great Britain in 1775 and 1776. 
The War was against the Ministry, against the Army, 
against the Navy, against their stores : but not against 
the King, the Nation, the Parliament, not against British 
subjects, nor private Property. I thought as  Captain Sddon did. All appeared to me to be duplicity, Hypocrisy, Childrens Play. But I was a wild enthusiast, 
the worst of Men, and the most dangerous. So said 
the Quakers and Proprietarians of Pensilvania, and so 
thought the Tories in all the States and in G. Britain. 
Poor Selman and Broughton were stripped of their 
Prey. The Governor, the Judge were released and all 
the Public and private Property. Who can blame them 
for their Chagrin ? or Congress or Washington for disappointing them ? But it seems the Public lost two of 
their best Naval officers by it. Pray return these 
papers to me, whether Mr. Carey will or will not make 
any use of any part of them. 

Yours, yours, yours

Dear Rush, — I thank you for the slip of a newspaper. 
On that subject my feelings are unutterable. The Day 
of the safe return of my Son and his Family, if I should 
live to see it, will be the happiest day of my Life. I 
almost envy you the Joy on the return of your Benjamin. Thank him for my Samos Muscat. Tell him my 
Girls shall all drink his Health in a Bumper of it 1 
wish my sons and grandsons had been to Samos instead 
of losing their Lives and Labours as their Father and 
Grandfather did in Diplomatick Dulness, where Knaves 
find fortune and honest Men Ruin. 

In Edis's Gazette printed in <a href='/results.php?city=watertown' rel='city'>Watertown</a>, Nov. 13. 
1775, is a Copy of "An Act for encouraging the fixing 
out of armed vessels to defend the sea coast of America, and for creating a Court to try and condemn all 
vessels that shall be found infesting the same." If Mr. Carey will print this Law, of " the sixteenth year of the 
Reign of George the third. King, &amp;c.," I will send him 
a copy of it, tho made at the expense of my worn eyes 
and trembling fingers. If he cannot or will not print 
it, printed it shall be in a <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Newspaper, if I am 
obliged to pay for it, at the rate of Advertisements. 
Although there is an unlimited Licence for Libels, there 
is the utmost difficulty in procuring the Publication of 
any Thing of real value. I say it shall be printed at 
my own expense, because I think it one of the most 
curious, interesting and important Documents in the 
History of the World. It is the first Ray of Aurora. 
It is the Commencement of an Epocha in the History 
of Mankind. It is the beginning of a System which is 
to produce a Revolution on this Globe. It is to destroy 
the Despotism of Great Britain ; the Universal Monarchy of Great Britain ; the Universal Empire of Great 
Britain over the Ocean, and consequently over the 
Globe. 

Not indeed to produce a Revolution in the Empire of the Ocean in favour of America, nor substitute one 
Despotism in the place of another, but to annihilate all 
Domination at sea and establish a universal and perpetual Liberty for all Nations Neutral and belligerent 
on that element. 

British Subjects and French Subjects, and Dutch 
Capitalists and <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Citizens and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> Citizens 
and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> Citizens and <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> Citizens and 
Geneva Citizens and Italian Subjects and Spaniards and 
Portuguese, and Russians and Germans and Prussians, 
may be more plausibly suspected than their Governments of participating in the Loan of Girard and Parrish. I have searched the hearts of Capitalists and 
Money Lenders and Usurers and Shavers, too long to 
doubt that Loans may be obtained to any amount at 
seven or eight per cent. 

The Liberty of the ocean is the Pretext ; but the 
Power of the Union The Object: as Calvinism and 
Catholicism were the Pretexts ; but the Power of France 
the Object of the civil Wars of France 200 years ago. 
So much in answer to your Question. 

Your time will be well applied in preparing your two 
Tracts for the Press. Posterity will do you Justice. 

"Sons will blush their Fathers were your Foes.** 

So wishes and so believes, without a doubt, 
one who is and who was and who will be 
your Friend

Dear Madam, — Yesterday Morning, hoping to receive a Letter from your Husband, the Messenger 
brought me a Letter from Dr. Waterhouse with the 
melancholly, the afflicting account of his Death. There 
is not a Man out of my own Family, remaining in the 
World in whom I had so much confidence, for whom I 
had so tender an Affection, and whose Friendship was 
so essential to my Happiness. My Loss, and my sensibility of it can bear no proportion however, my dear 
Madam to yours. Most sincerely do I sympathize with 
you and your Family under this severe dispensation of 
<a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>. The Worth of this dear departed Friend, 
his Talents, his Virtues, his services to his Country and to 
Mankind are far beyond my Powers to describe. They 
are fortunately recorded in his imperishable Works. 

For himself he had lived long enough. Not a doubt 
can be entertained for a Moment of his present Felicity. 
He has left you Madam for your Consolation Sons and 
Daughters worthy of him and of you ; ornaments to 
their Family and to their Country. I pray you Madam 
to present to each of them my cordial Condolence and 
best Wishes for their Prosperity. 

The Lot of Humanity cannot be changed or avoided. 
Inevitable Misfortunes must be borne, and ought to be 
welcomed as the Result of Wisdom and Benevolence, 
intended for our ultimate Benefit. So believes and so in 
this Instance prays 

Dear Madam, your sincere Friend and 

obliged servant

Madam Rush.

<a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city origin'>Quincy</a>, <a rel="month origin" value="2">Feb.</a> lo. <a href='/results.php?year=1812' rel="origin">1812</a>. 

Mr. Dreamer, — Your dream is out, and the Passage you read in the History that Richard was reading is 
come to pass, notwithstanding you said you believed no History but the Bible. 

Mr. Mediator, — You have wrought wonders ! You 
have made Peace between Powers that never were at 
War ! You have reconciled Friends that never were 
at enmity! You have brought again Babylon and 
Carthage long since annihilated, into fresh existence ! 
Like the Pythoness of Endor you have called up 
Spirits from the vasty deep of obscurity and oblivion, 
to a new acquaintance with each other ! 

Mr. Conjuror, — In short the mighty defunct Potentates of Mount WoUaston and <a href='/results.php?city=monticello' rel='city'>Monticello</a> by your 
Sorceries and Necromances, are again in being. Intercourse and Commerce have been restored by your 
Magic, between Neutrals, whose Interests and Reputation has been long sacrificed by the Systems of 
Retalliation adopted by two hostile and enraged and 
infuriated Factions. 

Huzza ! You will say, but what does all this Rhapsody mean ? Nothing more nor less than that a Correspondence of thirty five or thirty six years standing 
interrupted by various causes for some time, has been 
renewed in 1812 and no less than four letters have 
already passed between the Parties ; Those from Jefferson written with all the elegance, purity and sweetness, 
I would rather say Mellifluity or Mellifluidity, of Ws 
youth and middle age, and what I envy still more with 
a firmness of Finger and a steadiness of Chirography, 
that to me is lost, forever. 

I shall now flatter you or mortify you ; I care not 
much which. 

Two or three days ago, I met at Dr. Vinton's in this 
Town a Review of your Lectures. I lent the copy you 
sent to our Lt Governor and his Lady, and have not 
seen it since. The Review is written I know not by 
whom, but I suspect by some young Physicians of 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. I assure you we have a number of young 
Fellows in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> whom you might justly be proud to 
boast, if they had been your Pupils. I had not time to 
read the whole, nor any Part with much Attention, but 
I was pleased to see and proud to see that they did you 
as much justice as I could have done in Conscience. 
They explicitly and decidedly acknowledge your Superiority to every other Physician that is or has been in 
America ; but they remonstrate with a Modesty and 
diffidence, in them extreamly amiable and becoming, 
against your disrespect for the learned Languages. 
In this I have the honour to unite with them in heart, 
soul, understanding and voice. God forbid that Greek 
should ever be forgotten on this Globe, to which it is 
the greatest honour; the glory of all other Nations 
since it, having been derived from it 

Compose yourself, Rush. Richard will do well. 
Young men must judge for themselves in the last 
resort. The authority of Parents must not always be 
absolute. I have pested as peevishly and fretfully as 
you do, against Johns Mission to Holland ; his Mission 
to Russia, and even against his Professorship at the 

University. I always thought and believe it still not 
only that it would have been more for his Interest but 
more for the public good that he should have devoted 
himself to his Profession. I have grieved and so have 
all his Friends and enemies too that he did not indeed 
he could not accept the seat of a Judge. The World 
was not made for us old men. Young men have their 
views and feelings and must judge for themselves ; and 
I believe their decisions are more correct and impartial 
than ours. 

Adieu, 

<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">John Adams</a>.

P.S. — I have made two new words, you see, Mellifluity and Mellifluidity. As an independent nation we 
have as good a right to coin words as well as money 
as the English have or ever had. We are no more 
bound by Johnson's Dictionary, than by the common 
or statute or Cannon Law of England. I approve 
Jefferson's word " Belittle" and hope it will be incorporated into our American Dictionaries. I hope however that the English will not drive us to the necessity 
of imitating the Policy of our Ancestors, by rejecting 
Words merely because they are English, as they rejected The Word Parish for Precinct, Church for Meeting, and in many other instances. We ought to have 
an American Dictionary ; after which I should be willing 
to lay a Tax of an Eagle a Volume upon all English 
Dictionaries that should ever be imported.

Friend of 74, — Say what you will, that Man is in a poor case who is reduced to the necessity of looking to Posterity for Justice or Charity; and he who is 
obliged to fly to Newgate and to Cobbet for consolation, is in a more forlorn situation stilL 

Col. P. is entertaining and instructing the Public by a new series of Addresses to the People, the fourth number of which I read in Dr. Parks Repertory last 
night, in which he charges Jefferson and Madison with Duplicity, Falsehood, Deception, Hipocracy, Enmity to commerce, Subserviency to Napoleon, concert with him 
to destroy Great Britain, &amp;a, &amp;c*, &amp;c. 

Witherspoon had WuU and sense and taste; but his Maxim is not universally infallible. Scandal may be sometimes killed much sooner than it would die a 
natural death. You may be as wise as the old Scott with his written muffled tongue, by saying that Scandal is the Devil ; the Author of all the Evil in the Universe ; 
the cause of all the Wars ; dissendons and Revolutions, Duels, Suicides, murders, massacres on this earth. You will soon see the fruits of scandal in the votes of 
Massachusetts and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. The Northern Politicians, for twelve years past have retaliated upon the 
Southern Politicians, the scandal they published and recorded against me for twelve years before. I would subscribe 100 Guineas for a compleat edition of all the 
Scandal against me from 1789 to 1801, contained in the circular Letters of the Members of Congress from all the Southern and middle States. Do you remember 
the hellish Lies of your old Finley and your old Smilie. 

The Tory part of the northern Politicians have for eleven years past retalliated upon the Southern and middle States their Lies and Scandals, their Impudence, 
Insolence, and almost, not quite, their Seditions, Insurrections and Rebellions. 

There is a difference, Doctor Rush, between Truth 
and Falsehood, Right and Wrong, Virtue and Vice : 
Let us not endeavour to confound them. There is 
something hollow, something rotten, which if not explained will end in Blood and Division. How soon did 
the scandal of your Tench Cox, your Augustus Muhlenburg, your Peter Muhlenburg, die without being 
killed? And why was Augustus Muhlenburg my 
enemy? Because I did not comply with his servile 
abject Beggary of the Office of Treasurer of the Mint, 
which he had the creeping humility to beg of me by 
Letter under his hand : and because I bestowed that 
office upon Dr. Benjamin Rush against his, Muhlenburg s solicitations and forty others. I have told you 
in former letters why Peter Muhlenburg joined with 
Tench Cox and his Brother in propagating Scandal 
against me. Hamilton would not let Washington, and 
Washington and the Senate would not let me make 
him a Brigadier General, and therefore he united with 
Tench , Muhlenburg, Pierce Buderand another 

of your Philosophical Scoundrels whose name I have 
forgot, to libel and scandalize me. 

If you can publish a compleat Treatise of Madness, 
you will instruct Mankind in a compleat System of 
Religion, Morals, Philosophy and Policy from the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Paradise, to the last 
embargo and the last vote against an American Navy. 

By the way I ought to say one word more about 
Scandal. I know of no remedy against it, but Puffing. Ld Mansfield took a fancy tx&gt; our Copely. He sat to 
him for his picture in every stage and station of his 
life, even to that of Min. Plen. in which he had been 
employed to negotiate some trifling thing in the diplomatic way. He loved to chatt with Copeley. He said 
to him one day, ** Copeley, your reputation and your 
employments and profits are not in proportion to your 
Merit" "My Lord," said C. "I do not complain. I 
am not dissatisfied with my success." " Copeley" said 
his Lordship, "you have not learned your Art, you 
have derived no reputation from the Puffers. You 
must find out and employ the Puffers." 

These Puffers, Rush, are the only killers of Scandal. 
Washington, Franklin — I will go no farther at present 
— killed all scandal by Puffers. You and I have never 
employed them and therefore scandal has prevailed 
against us. 

I have but one more word to say. My son-in-law, 
whom you mention, I assure you never spoke in my 
hearing one disrespectful word of any Man of ten or 
fifteen or twenty talents. I have never conversed with 
any officer who uniformly mentioned his General with 
more affection and respect. Steuben told Smith that 
Washington once said to him, " Steuben, that Smith was 
a stiff-backed young man," and this anecdote Smith told 
me. But not one word did he ever utter in my presence 
of resentment and disrespect to Washington living, or 
to his memory since his death. He once explained to 
me upon my enquiry, the story that Tom Paine has 
blazened all over Europe and America of black Sam*s 
wife and a pretty girl from Jersey or <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> or 
somewhere, which he said was whispered and snickered 
a little in the Army for a time, but without one word 
expressive of his belief of the scandal. I never knew 
a more sincere Friend to Washington as far as I could 
judge, than Billy Smith. 

Jefferson has sent me his ** Batture'* a most sensible, 
learned and masterly Pamphlet. I hope Ned Livingston 
has opened Jeff's eyes on the subject of Jonathan 
Robbins, a scandal that ought to have been killed 
before it died of old age. Indeed I know not whether 
it be dead yet. A more infernal, wicked, malicious, 
unprincipled deliberate and cruel scandal never stalked 
this earth. 

Farewell Friend of 1774 for the present. 

<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">John Adams</a>.
