</p><p>
MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
THERE has been a very general apprehension during 
the last week, that a general action would happen as 
on yesterday, but we hear of none. Our army is en 
camped between Newport and White Clay Creek, on 
advantageous ground. The General has harangued 
his army, and published in general orders, in order to 
prepare their minds for something great, and has held 
up the example of Stark, Herkimer, Gansevoort and 
their troops to animate his officers and men with emulation. Whether he expects to be attacked, or 
whether he designs to offend, I can t say. 
</p><p>
A general action which should terminate in a defeat 
of Howe, would be complete and final ruin to him. 
If it should terminate only in a drawn battle, it would 
be the same thing. If he should gain a victory and 
, maintain possession of the field, he would lose so 
many men killed and wounded, that he would scarcely 
have enough left to march to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, surrounded as he would be with militia and the broken 
remains of the continental army. But if there should 
be no general battle, and the two armies should 
lounge away the remainder of the campaign in silent 
inactivity, gazing at each other, Howe's reputation 
would be ruined in his own country and in all Europe, 
and the dread of him would cease in all America. 
The American mind, which, I think, has more firmness now, than it ever had before, since this war be 
gan, would acquire a confidence and strength, that all 
the efforts of Great Britain afterwards would not be 
able to relax. 
</p><p>
You will see by the papers enclosed that we have 
been obliged to attempt to humble the pride of some 
Jesuits, who call themselves Quakers,but who love 
money and land better than liberty or religion. The 
hypocrites are endeavoring to raise the cry of persecution, and to give this matter a religious turn, but 
they can t succeed. The world knows them and 
their communications. Actuated by a land-jobbing 
spirit like that of William Penn, they have been solicking grants of immense regions of land on the 
Ohio. American independence has disappointed them, 
which makes them hate it. Yet the dastards dare not 
avow their hatred to it, it seems. 
</p><p>
The moments are critical here. We know not but 
the next will bring us an account of a general engagement begun, and when once begun, we know not how 
it will end, for the battle is not always to the strong. 
The events of war are uncertain. All that we can do 
is to pray, as I do most devoutly, that we may be victorious ; at least, that we may not be vanquished. 
Bat if it should be the will of Heaven that our army 
should be defeated, our artillery lost, our best generals killed, and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> fall into Mr. Howe's hands, 
still America is not conquered. America would yet 
be possessed of great resources, and capable of great 
exertions, as mankind would see. It may, for what I 
know be the design of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> that this should be 
the case. Because it would only lay the foundations 
of American independence deeper, and cement them 
stronger. It would cure Americans of their vicious 
and luxurious and effeminate appetites, passions and 
habits, a more dangerous army to American liberty 
than Mr. Howe's. 
</p><p>
However, without the loss of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> we must 
be brought to an entire renunciation of foreign commodities, at least of West India produce. People are 
coming to this resolution very fast here. Loaf sugar 
at four dollars a pound, wine at three dollars a bottle, 
&c., will soon introduce economy in the use of these 
articles. This spirit of economy would be more terrible to Great Britain than any thing else, and it would 
make us more respectable in the eyes of all Europe. 
Instead of acrimonious altercations between town and 
country, and between farmer and merchant, I wish 
that my dear countrymen would agree in this virtuous 
resolution of depending on themselves alone. Let 
them make salt and live without sugar and rurn. 
</p><p>
I am grieved to hear of the angry contentions 
among you. That improvident act for limiting prices has done great injury, and in my sincere opinion, 
if not repealed, will ruin the State, and introduce a 
civil war. I know not how unpopular this sentiment 
may be, but it is sincerely mine. There are rascally 
upstarts in trade, I doubt not, who have made great 
fortunes in a small period, who are monopolizing 
and oppressing. But how this can be avoided entirely, I know not, but by disusing their goods, and 
letting them perish in their hands.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
You will learn, from the newspapers, before this 
reaches you, the situation of things here. Mr. Howe's 
army is at Chester, about fifteen miles from this town. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a>'s is over the Schuylkill, awaiting 
the flank of Mr. Howe's army. How much longer 
Congress will stay is uncertain. I hope we shall not 
move until the last necessity, that is, until it shall be 
rendered certain that Mr. Howe will get the city. If 
we should move, it will be to Reading, Lancaster, 
York, Easton, or <a href='/results.php?city=bethlehem' rel='city'>Bethlehem</a>, some town in this State. 
It is the determination not to leave this State. Don t 
be anxious about me, nor about our great and sacred 
cause. It is the cause of truth and will prevail. If 
Howe gets the city, it will cost him all his force to 
keep it, and so he can get nothing else. 
My love to all friends. 
</p><p>
Yours.

MY BEST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
IT is now a long time since I had an opportunity of 
writing to you, and I fear you have suffered unnecessary anxiety on my account. In the morning of the 
19th instant, the Congress were alarmed in their beds 
by a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Hamilton</a>, one of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a>'s family, that the enemy was in possession of 
the ford over the Schuylkill and the boats, so that they 
had it in their power to be in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> before 
morning. The papers of Congress belonging to the Secretary's office, the War office, the Treasury office, &c., 
were before sent to Bristol. The President, and all the 
other gentlemen were gone that road, so I followed 
with my friend Mr. Marchant, of Rhode Island, to <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, in the Jerseys. We stayed at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> until the 
21st, when we set off to Easton, upon the forks of 
Delaware. From Easton we went to <a href='/results.php?city=bethlehem' rel='city'>Bethlehem</a>, from 
thence to Reading, from thence to Lancaster, and 
from thence to this town, which is about a dozen 
miles over the Susquehannah river. Here Congress 
is to sit. In order to convey the papers with safety, 
which are of more importance than all the members, 
we were induced to take this circuit, which is near a 
hundred and eighty miles, whereas this town, by the 
direct road, is not more than eighty-eight miles from 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. This tour has given me an opportunity 
of seeing many parts of this country which I never 
saw before. 
</p><p>
This morning <a href='/results.php?tla=rot' rel='met'>Major Troup</a> arrived here with a 
large packet from <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel=''>General Gates</a>, containing very 
agreeable intelligence, which I need not repeat, as 
you have much earlier intelligence from that part 
than we have. I wish affairs here wore as pleasing 
an aspect. But alas, they do not. 
</p><p>
I shall avoid every thing like history, and make no 
reflections. However, <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> is in a 
condition tolerably respectable, and the militia are 
now turning out from Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania in small numbers. All the apology that can 
be made for this part of the world is, that Mr. Howe's 
march from Elk to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, was through the 
very regions of passive obedience. The whole country 
through which he passed is inhabited by Quakers. 
</p><p>
There is not such another body of Quakers in all 
America, perhaps not in all the world. 
</p><p>
I am still of opinion that <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> will be no 
loss to us. I am very comfortably situated here in the 
house of General Roberdeau, whose hospitality has 
taken in Mr. S. Adams, Mr. Gerry and me. My 
health is as good as common, and I assure you my 
spirits not the worse for the loss of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. Bid- 
die in the continental frigate, at South Carolina, has 
made a noble cruise and taken four very valuable 
prizes.

I HAVE no time nor accommodation to write of late ; 
besides, I. seldom know what to write, and when I do, 
I don't love to write it. One thing is now becoming 
more and more certain every day, that is, that our 
people will and do fight. And although they make a 
clumsy hand of it, yet they do better and better. 
</p><p>
I am lodged in the house of General Roberdeau, an 
Israelite indeed, I believe, who with his sisters and 
children and servants does every thing to make us happy. We are highly favored. No other delegates are 
so well off. I am as well as usual. Your dream 
will never come to pass. You never can be coolly 
received by me while my heart beats and my senses 
remain.

I had no letter from you by the last post.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE not been able of late to keep up my correspondence with you so constantly as my heart inclined 
me to do. But I hope now to write you oftener; but 
I don t incline to write very particularly, lest my letters should be intercepted. I am in tolerable health, 
but oppressed with a load of public cares. I have 
long foreseen that we should be brought down to a 
great degree of depression before the people of America would be convinced of their real danger, of the 
true causes of it, and be stimulated to take the necessary steps for a reformation. Government and law in 
the States, large taxation, and strict discipline in our 
armies, are the only things wanting as human means. 
These with the blessing of Heaven will certainly produce glory, triumph, liberty, and safety, and peace ; 
and nothing but these will do. 
</p><p>
I long with the utmost impatience to come home. 
Don t send a servant for me. The expense is so 
enormous that I cannot bear the thought of it. I will 
crawl home upon my little pony, and wait upon my 
self as well as I can. I think you had better sell my 
horse. 
</p><p>
The people are universally calling for fighting and 
for blood. Washington is getting into the humor of 
fighting, and Howe begins to dread it. And well he 
may. Fighting will certainly answer the end, al 
though we may be beaten every time for a great 
while. We have been heretofore greatly deceived 
concerning the numbers of militia. But there are 
numbers enough, if they knew how to fight, which as 
soon as their Generals will let them, they will learn. 
I am, with every tender sentiment, 
</p><p>
Yours forevermore.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
IT is with shame that I recollect that I have not writ 
ten you more than two or three letters these five weeks, 
and those very short. News I am afraid to write, be 
cause I never know, until it is too late, what is true. 
From last Sunday to this moment, Friday afternoon 
four o clock, we have been in a state of tormenting 
uncertainty concerning our affairs at the northward 
On Sunday, we had news from the committee of 
<a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> through <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel=''>Governor Clinton</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> of a capitulation of Burgoyne and his whole 
army. To this moment we have no express from 
Gates nor any authentic confirmation. 
</p><p>
Howe has drawn his army into the city, and Washington is at Germantown. Supplies will be cut off 
from the British army in a great measure. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., yours forever. 
</p><p>
We shall finish a plan of confederation in a few 
days.

</p><p>
MY BEST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THIS town is a small one, not larger than <a href='/results.php?city=plymouth' rel='city'>Plymouth</a>. 
There are in it two German churches, the one Luther 
an, the other Calvinistical. The congregations are pretty numerous and their attendance upon public worship is decent. It is remarkable that the Germans-, 
wherever they are found, are careful to maintain the 
public worship, which is more than can be said of the 
other denominations of Christians, this way. There is 
one Church here erected by the joint contributions of 
Episcopalians and Presbyterians, but the minister, who 
is a missionary, is confined for Toryism, so that they 
have had for a long time no public worship. Congress have appointed two chaplains, Mr. White and 
Mr. Duffielcl, the former of whom, an Episcopalian, 
is arrived, and opens Congress with prayers every 
day. The latter is expected every hour. Mr. Duche, 
I am sorry to inform you, has turned out an apostate 
and a traitor. Poor man ! I pity his weakness and 
detest his wickedness. 
</p><p>
As to news we are yet in a painful suspense about 
affairs at the northward, but from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, we 
have accounts that are very pleasing. Commodore Hazelwood with his galleys, and Lieutenant Colonel Smith in the garrison of fort Mifflin, have behaved in 
a manner the most gallant and glorious. They have 
defended the river and the fort with a firmness and 
perseverance which does honor to human nature. If 
the news from the northward is true, Mr. Howe will 
scarcely venture upon winter quarters in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
We are waiting for news from Rhode Island. 
</p><p>
I am wearied with the life I lead, and long for the 
joys of my family. God grant I may enjoy it in 
peace. Peace is my dear delight. War has no charms 
for me. If I live much longer in banishment I shall 
scarcely know my own children. Tell my little ones, 
that if they will be very good, papa will come home.

</p><p>
MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
MR. COLMAN goes off for <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> to-morrow. I have 
seized a moment to congratulate you on the great and 
glorious success of our arms at the northward and in 
Delaware river. The forts at Province Island and 
Redbank have been defended with a magnanimity 
which will give our country a reputation in Europe. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=chg' rel=''>Colonel Greene</a> repulsed the enemy from Redbank and 
took Count Donop and his aid prisoners. Colonel Smith repulsed a bold attack upon fort Mifflin, and 
our galleys disabled two men of war, a sixty-four and 
a twenty-gun ship, in such a manner, that the enemy blew them up. This comes confirmed this even 
ing, in letters from <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a>, enclosing 
original letters from officers in the forts. 
</p><p>
Congress will appoint a thanksgiving ; and one 
cause of it ought to be, that the glory of turning the 
tide of arms is not immediately due to the Commander-in-chief nor to southern troops. If it had been, 
idolatry and adulation would have been unbounded ; 
so excessive as to endanger our liberties, for what I 
know. Now, we can allow a certain citizen to be 
wise, virtuous and good without thinking him a deity 
or a saviour.

</p><p>
MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
WE have been three days soaking and poaching in the 
heaviest rain that has been known for several years, 
</p><p>
allusion to the position of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> in Congress at 
this time. It is very well known that the Conway cabal, in its 
origin exclusively a military intrigue with very base motives, 
obtained its greatest source of influence in Congress from the 
coincidence in time between the defeats of Washington at 
Brandywine and Germantown, and the victory of Gates over 
Burgoyne in the north. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='me'>Mr. Adams</a> does not appear ever to 
have favored that cabal, but he always looked with some ap 
prehension upon the powers with which Washington had been 
invested. In a manuscript sketch of his character, drawn by 
Or. Benjamin Rush, it is stated that a motion was made in 
Congress, on the I Jth of February, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>, to surrender to the 
General the power of appointing his officers, but no such motion appears on the Journal. It is more probable that the pro 
position was made in the course of the debate that took place 
on that day upon going into the election of five Major Generals, but was never put into form, and therefore was not record 
ed. Upon that proposition Dr. Rush reports <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='me'>Mr. Adams</a> to 
have said these words : " There are certain principles which 
follow us through life, and none more certainly than the love 
of the first place. We see it in the forms in which children sit 
at schools. It prevails equally to the latest period of life. I 
am sorry to find it prevail so little in this house. I have been 
distressed to see some of our members disposed to idolize an 
image which their own hands have molten. I speak of the 
superstitious veneration which is paid to <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a>. 
and what adds to the gloom is, the uncertainty in 
which we remain to this moment, concerning the fate 
of Gates and Burgoyne. We are out of patience. It 
is impossible to bear this suspense with any temper. 
</p><p>
I am in comfortable lodgings, which is a felicity 
that has fallen to the lot of a very few of our members. Yet the house where I am is so thronged, that 
I cannot enjoy such accommodations as I wish. I 
cannot have a room as I used, and therefore cannot 
find opportunities to write as I once did. 
</p><p>
The people of this country are chiefly Germans, 
who have schools in their own language, as well as 
prayers, psalms, and sermons, so that multitudes 
are born, grow up and die here, without ever learning 
the English. In politics they are a breed of mongrels 
</p><p>
I honor him for his good qualities, but in this house, I feel my 
self his superior. In private life, I shall always acknowledge 
him to be mine." These sentiments were the offspring of 
a jealousy which had been nourished by the study of his 
tory and the observation of those examples in which it abounds, 
of the abuse of great powers by military chieftains. They par 
took of no hostility to the man. This will appear more fully 
by reference to the letter in this collection of the 21st of February of this year, written almost in the hour of the debate, 
where <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> is particularly excepted from a censure passed upon several other officers. The same feeling which 
prompted the speech reappears in the present letter. Had 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> proved to be merely on the level of ordinary military heroes, and like them, had lie attempted the liberties 
of his country, his course would have earned for <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='me'>Mr. Adams</a> 
a high reputation. As it turned out, it came very near implicating him, in the popular judgment, with the unworthy personal 
intrigues for precedence of English adventurers in the American army, whose admission into it he had disapproved. 
or neutrals, and benumbed with a general torpor. If 
the people in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and 
Jersey had the feelings and the spirit of some people 
that I know, Howe would be soon ensnared in a trap 
more fatal than that in which, as it is said, Burgoyne 
was taken. Howe is completely in our power, and if 
he is not totally ruined, it will be entirely owing to 
the awkwardness and indolence of this country. 
Fighting, however, begins to become fashionable. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=chg' rel=''>Colonel Greene</a> has exhibited a glorious example in 
the defence of Red Bank. But this must be done by 
a New England man at the head of two New England regiments, Rhode Islanders. Colonel Smith, 
however, is a Marylander from <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>. He has 
shown another example of magnanimity which gives 
me the most agreeable hopes. Commodore Hazel- 
wood, too, has behaved in a manner that exceeds all 
praise. This spirit will be caught by other officers, for 
bravery is epidemical and contagious as the plague. 
This army suffers much for want of blankets and shoes. 
I celebrated the 25th of this month in my own 
mind and heart much more than I shall the 30th,be 
cause I think the first a more fortunate day than the 
last. My duty to your father and my mother, to uncles and aunts. Love to brothers and sisters ; but 
above all, present all the affection that words can express to our dear babes.

MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
I ARRIVED here last evening, in good health. This 
morning General Whipple made me a visit at the tavern, Tilton's, and insisted upon my taking a bed at his 
house, in so very affectionate and urgent a manner, 
that I believe I shall go to his house. 
</p><p>
The cause comes on to-morrow before my old friend 
Dr. Joshua Brackett as judge of admiralty. How it 
will go, I know not. The captors are a numerous 
company, and are said to be very tenacious, and have 
many connexions; so that we have prejudice and influence to fear. Justice, policy and law are, I am 
sure, on our side. 
</p><p>
I have had many opportunities, in the course of 
this journey, to observe how deeply rooted our righteous cause is in the minds of the people ; and could 
write you many anecdotes in proof of it. But I will 
reserve them for private conversation. On second 
thoughts, why should I ? One evening, as I satin one 
room, I overheard a company of the common sort of 
people in another, conversing upon serious subjects. 
One of them, whom I afterwards found upon inquiry to be a reputable, religious man, was more eloquent 
than the rest. He was upon the danger of despising 
and neglecting serious things, and said, " Whatever per 
son or people made light of them, would soon find them 
selves terribly mistaken." At length I heard these 
words : " It appears to me the eternal son of God is 
operating powerfully against the British nation for 
their treating lightly serious things." 
</p><p>
One morning I asked my landlady what I had to 
pay ? " Nothing," she said, " I was welcome, and 
she hoped I would always make her house my home. 
And she should be happy to entertain all those gentlemen who had been raised up by <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> to be 
the saviours of their country." This was flattering 
enough to my vain heart. But it made a greater impression on me, as a proof how deeply this cause had 
sunk into the minds and hearts of the people. 
</p><p>
In short, every thing I see and hear indicates the 
same thing.

MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
I ARRIVED here last evening, in good health. This 
morning General Whipple made me a visit at the tavern, Tilton's, and insisted upon my taking a hed at his 
house, in so very affectionate and urgent a manner, 
that I believe I shall go to his house. 
</p><p>
The cause comes on to-morrow before my old friend 
Dr. Joshua Brackett as judge of admiralty. How it 
will go, I know not. The captors are a numerous 
company, and are said to be very tenacious, and have 
many connexions ; so that we have prejudice and influence to fear. Justice, policy and law are, I am 
sure, on our side. 
</p><p>
I have had many opportunities, in the course of 
this journey, to observe how deeply rooted our righteous cause is in the minds of the people ; and could 
write you many anecdotes in proof of it. But I will 
reserve them for private conversation. On second 
thoughts, why should I ? One evening, as I sat in one 
room, I overheard a company of the common sort of 
people in another, conversing upon serious subjects. 
One of them, whom I afterwards found upon inquiry to be a reputable, religious man, was more eloquent 
than the rest. He was upon the danger of despising 
and neglecting serious things, and said, " Whatever per 
son or people made light of them, would soon find them 
selves terribly mistaken." At length I heard these 
words : " It appears to me the eternal son of God is 
operating powerfully against the British nation for 
their treating lightly serious things." 
</p><p>
One morning I asked my landlady what I had to 
pay ? " Nothing," she said, " I was welcome, and 
she hoped I would always make her house my home. 
And she should be happy to entertain all those gentlemen who had been raised up by <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> to be 
the saviours of their country." This was flattering 
enough to my vain heart. But it made a greater impression on me, as a proof how deeply this cause had 
sunk into the minds and hearts of the people. 
</p><p>
In short, every thing I see and hear indicates the 
same thing.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
MONSIEUR CHAUMONT has just informed me of a vessel bound to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, but I am reduced to such a moment of time, that I can only inform you that I am 
well, and enclose a few lines from Johnny to let you 
know that he is so. I have ordered the things you de 
sired to be sent you, but I will not yet say by what conveyance, for fear of accidents. 
</p><p>
If human nature could be made happy by anything 
that can please the eye, the ear, the taste, or any 
other sense, or passion, or fancy, this country would 
be the region for happiness. But if my country were 
at peace, I should be happier among the rocks and 
shades of Penn's hill ; and would cheerfully exchange 
all the elegance, magnificence, and sublimity of Eu 
rope, for the simplicity of <a href='/results.php?city=braintree' rel='city'>Braintree</a> and Weymouth. 
</p><p>
To tell you the truth, I admire the ladies here. 
Don t be jealous. They are handsome, and very 
well educated. Their accomplishments are exceedingly brilliant, and their knowledge of letters and arts 
exceeds that of the English ladies, I believe. 
</p><p>
Tell Mrs. Warren that I shall write her a letter, as 
she desired, and let her know some of my reflections 
in this country. My venerable colleague enjoys a 
privilege here, that is much to be envied. Being 
seventy years of age, the ladies not only allow him to 
embrace them as often as he pleases, but they are 
perpetually embracing him. I told him, yesterday, 
I would write this to America.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
ON the 13th of February I left you. It is now the 
3d of June, and I have not received a line, nor heard 
a word, directly nor indirectly, concerning you, since 
my departure. This is a situation of mind in which I 
never was before, and I assure you, I feel a great deal 
of anxiety at it ; yet I do not wonder at it, because I 
suppose few vessels have sailed from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> since 
ours. I have shipped for you the articles you re 
quested, and the black cloth for your father, to whom present my most affectionate and dutiful respects. 
Captain Tucker, if he should not be unlucky, will 
give you an account of your things. 
</p><p>
It would be endless to attempt a description of this 
country. It is one great garden. Nature and art 
have conspired to render every thing here delightful. 
Religion and government, you will say, ought to be 
excepted. With all my heart. But these are no 
afflictions to me, because I have well fixed it in rny 
mind as a principle, that every nation has a right to 
that religion and government, which it chooses, and 
as long as any people please themselves in these 
great points, I am determined they shall not displease me. 
</p><p>
There is so much danger that my letter may fall 
into malicious hands, that I should not choose to be 
too free in my observations upon the customs and 
manners of this people. But thus much I may say 
with truth and without offence, that there is no people 
in the world who take so much pains to please, nor 
any whose endeavors in this way have more success. 
Their arts and manners, taste and language, are 
more respected in Europe than those of any other nation. Luxury, dissipation and effeminacy are pretty 
nearly of the same degree of excess here, and in 
every other part of Europe. The great cardinal virtue of temperance, however, I believe, flourishes here 
more than in any other part of Europe. 
</p><p>
My dear countrymen ! how shall I persuade you to 
avoid the plague of Europe ! Luxury has as many 
and as bewitching charms on your side of the ocean 
as on this ; and luxury, wherever she goes, effaces 
from human nature the image of the Divinity. 
If I had power I would forever banish and exclude 
from America all gold, silver, precious stones, alabaster, marble, silk, velvet and lace. 
</p><p>
0, the tyrant ! the American ladies would say. 
What ! Ay, my dear girls, these passions of yours 
which arc so easily alarmed, and others of my own 
sex which are exactly like them, have done, and will 
do the work of tyrants in all ages. Tyrants different 
from me, whose power has banished, not gold indeed, 
but other things of greater value, wisdom, virtue and 
liberty. My son and servant are well. I am, with 
an ardor that words have not power to express.

Yours,

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
SINCE my last, I have had the inexpressible pleasure 
of yours of the 25th of March by the way of Holland, 
which is the first and the last letter as yet received 
from you. This will be delivered to you by a young 
gentleman of the name of Archer, who is going to 
America to serve in our army as a volunteer. He is 
a promising youth, and will tell you all the news both 
in England and France. Germany seems at the eve 
of war. The Emperor and King of Prussia are at 
the head of armies, and on tiptoe to strike the blow. 
England seems to be lost in a stupor. Byron's fleet 
is not yet sailed. D Estaing's passed the straits of 
Gibraltar the 16th of May. 
</p><p>
We long to hear from America the ratification of 
the treaty with France, the captivity of <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel=''>General Clinton</a>'s army, and of Lord Howe's fleet. John is very 
well at school. Stevens is also well and behaves 
well. My love to all my little ones. 
</p><p>
I want a few pamphlets here ; " The thoughts on 
Government," " The <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> Constitution," " An 
essay of a constitution of government for Pennsylvania," said to have been written by Mr. Dickinson. 
Look them up and send them. 
</p><p>
I cannot learn that any reinforcement is to be sent 
to America this summer. They can spare none. 
They are in a panic from an apprehension of an invasion. Ireland is grown tumultuous, is concerting a 
non-importation agreement, and gives symptoms of an 
insurrection.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
A VERY idle, vain conversation at a dinner has produced you this letter from a venerable old lady in 
this neighborhood, the wife of Monsieur Grand the 
banker. As the subject was introduced, and according to the turn the conversation really took, there was 
not so much vanity and ostentation on my part as you 
will suspect from her account of it. But as I speak 
French very imperfectly, and she understands not a 
syllable of English, I suppose she did not fully under 
stand me. All that I maintained was, that it was the 
duty of a good citizen to sacrifice all to his country in 
some circumstances. God grant, I may never be 
called to do this again so often as I have done already, 
for I have hazarded all, very often, and done as much 
as sacrifice all, sometimes. You will have a deli 
cate task to answer her. Write to her in English. 
She has a son about five and twenty, who is a master 
of English, and will interpret. It is a virtuous family, 
and very civil to me and my dear Johnny, of whom 
the whole family is very fond. 
</p><p>
We are in deep concern for America ; the last ac 
counts having left D Estaing going to Rhode Island 
and Lord Howe after him. 
</p><p>
It is high time for me to write to my children, but 
hitherto I have not had time. I hope you have received twenty letters from me, in which I have desired 
you to draw upon me for what money you want. 
</p><p>
Yours,

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
WE have received information that so many of our 
letters have been thrown overboard, that I fear you 
will not have heard so often from me as both of us 
wish. I have written often, but my letters have not 
been worth so much as other things which I have sent 
you. I sent you a small present by Captain Niles, 
but he is taken by a Jersey privateer. I sent you also 
some other things by Captain Barnes ; and what affects 
me quite as much, I sent the things that my dear 
brother Cranch requested me to send, by the same 
vessels. These vessels were chosen because they 
were fast sailers, and so small as to be able to see 
danger before they could be seen ; but all is taken 
and sent into Guernsey and Jersey. By Captain 
Tucker, I sent you the whole of the list you gave me 
of articles for the family. These, I hope, have ar- 
rived safe, but I have been so unlucky that I feel 
averse to meddling in this way. The whole loss is a 
trifle, it is true. But to you, in the convenience of the 
family, and to Mr. Cranch in his business, it would 
have been of value. If the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> arrives, the little 
chest she carries to you will be of service. 
</p><p>
My anxiety for you and for the public is not diminished by time or distance. The great number of 
accidental disappointments in the course of the last 
summer are afflicting. But we hope for better luck 
another year. It seems to be the intention of Heaven 
that we should be taught the full value of our liberty 
by the dearness of the purchase, and the importance 
of public virtue by the necessity of it. There seems 
to be also a further design, that of eradicating forever 
from the heart of every American, every tender sentiment towards Great Britain, that we may, sometime 
or other, know how to make the full advantage of our 
independence by more extensive connexions with other 
countries. Whatever syren songs of peace may be sung 
in your ears, you may depend upon it from me, (who 
unhappily have been seldom mistaken in my guesses of 
the intentions of the British government for fourteen 
years,) that every malevolent passion and every insidious art will predominate in the British cabinet 
against us. Their threats of Russians and of great 
reinforcements are false and impracticable, and they 
know them to be so ; but their threats of doing mis 
chief with the forces they have, will be verified as far 
as their power. 
</p><p>
It is by no means pleasant to me to be forever impuling malicious policy to a nation that I have ever 
wished and still wish I could esteem. But truth must 
be attended to ; and almost all Europe, the Dutch especially, are at this day talking of Great Britain in 
the style of American sons of liberty. I hope the unfortunate events at Rhode Island I will produce no 
heart-burnings between our countrymen and the <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague met acquaintance'>Comte D Estaing</a>, who is allowed by all Europe to be 
a great and worthy officer, and by all who know him to be a zealous friend of America. 
</p><p>
I have enjoyed uncommon health since my arrival 
in this country, and, if it was peace and my family 
here, I could be happy. But never, never shall I en 
joy happy days without either. My little son gives 
me great pleasure both by his assiduity to his books, 
and his discreet behavior. The lessons of his mamma are a constant lesson to him, and the reflection 
that they are so to his sister and brothers are a never- 
failing consolation to me at times when I feel more 
tenderness for them than words can express, or than I 
should choose to express, if I had power. Remember 
me in the most affectionate manner to our parents, 
brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, and what shall I say 
children. 
</p><p>
My respects where they are due, which is in so 
many places that I cannot name them. With regard 
to my connexions with the public business here, which 
you will be naturally inquisitive to know something of, 
I can only say, that we have many disagreeable cir-

wishes of our constituents, and to give satisfaction to 
certain half-anglified Americans, and what is more 
serious and affecting, to real and deserving Americans, 
who are suffering in England, and escaping from 
thence. But from this court, this city and nation, I 
have experienced nothing but uninterrupted politeness. It is not possible for me to express more tenderness and affection to you than will be suggested by

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
MR. BROWN is here, and I cannot miss the opportunity by him to write you a line. I know not how 
often you receive letters from me, so many are taken 
or sunk ; but I write as often as I can. 
</p><p>
I have received some letters from you, which will 
occasion your name to be classed with Mrs. Macaulay and Madame Dacier, for aught I know. Johnny 
is very well. Stevens had a fall yesterday, which 
hurt him a little, but not very badly. He is in a good 
way this morning. The things enclosed, which were 
a present to me, you will do as you please with. 
Europe is the dullest place in the world. No news 
but the lies which the emissaries of England are 
making and spreading in every part. We get no 
news from Congress, or any part of America. By 
hints in some letters which I have heard of, I expect 
that the first vessel will bring us news of some new regulations of Congress concerning foreign affairs. It is 
said that Congress has determined to have but one 
commissioner at this court. If this is true, as I sup 
pose it is, as it comes from Mr. D., I am uncertain 
what is to be done with me. It is said that I am to 
be sent to some other court, and that the Doctor is to 
be here alone. If this should be the case, I should be 
puzzled what to do. The motives of Congress are 
very good to save expenses, but this motive will not 
have its effect, if I am to be maintained here in idleness, or sent upon my travels to other countries, 
where I shall not be received, which will be the most 
painful situation imaginable to me. In this case I 
should be at a loss whether to return home immediately, or wait until I could write to Congress and obtain leave. Some of my friends here are of opinion 
that I ought not to return without leave. I would not 
take any step that should give any just cause of of 
fence to Congress or the people. But I cannot eat 
pensions and sinecures. They would stick in my 
throat. I wish some honest vessel would arrive and 
resolve my doubts.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
LAST night an express from M. de Sartines, whose politeness upon this occasion was very obliging, brought 
me your letters of September 29th and October 10th. 
The joy which the receipt of these packets afforded 
me, was damped by the disagreeable articles of intelligence, but still more so by the symptoms of grief 
and complaint which appeared in the letters. For 
heaven's sake, my dear, don t indulge a thought that 
it is possible for me to neglect or forget all that is 
dear to me in this world. It is impossible for me to 
write as I did in America. What should I write ? It 
is not safe to write any thing that one is not willing 
should go into all the newspapers of the world. I 
know not by whom to write. I never know what conveyance is safe. Vessels may have arrived without 
letters from me. I am five hundred miles from Bordeaux, and not much less distant from Nantes. I 
know nothing of many vessels that go from the sea 
ports, and if I knew of all, there are some that I should 
not trust. Notwithstanding this, I have written to you 
not much less than fifty letters. I am astonished that 
you have received no more. But almost every vessel 
has been taken. Two vessels by which I sent goods 
to you for the use of your family, and one by which I sent Mr. Cranch's things, we know, have been taken. 
In every one of these I sent large packets of letters 
and papers for Congress, for you, and for many 
friends. God knows I don t spend my time in idleness, or in gazing at curiosities. I never wrote more 
letters, however empty they may have been. But by 
what I hear, they have been all, or nearly all, taken 
or sunk. My friends complain that they have not received letters from me. I may as well complain. I 
have received scarcely any letters from America. I 
have written three where I have received one. From 
my friend, <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='me'>Mr. Adams</a>, I have received only one 
short card ; from Mr. Gerry, not a syllable ; from Mr. Lovell, only two or three, very short. What shall I 
say ? I doubt not they have written oftener, but letters miscarry. Drs. Cooper and Gordon write to Dr. 
Franklin, not to me. My friend Warren has been 
good as usual. I have received several fine, long 
letters, full of sound sense, useful intelligence, and 
reflections as virtuous, as wise as usual from him. 
I have answered them and written more, but whether 
they arrive, I know not. 
</p><p>
I approve very much of your draught upon me in 
favor of your cousin. The moment it arrives, it shall 
be paid. Draw for more as you may have occasion. 
But make them give you gold and silver for your 
bills. Your son is the joy of my heart, without abating in the least degree of my affection for the young 
rogue that did not seem as if he had a father, or his 
brother or sister. Tell Abby her papa likes her the 
better for what she tells her brother, viz, : " that she 
don t talk much," because I know she thinks and 
feels the more. I hope the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> has arrived. She 
carried many things for you. 
</p><p>
Last night a friend from England brought me the 
King's speech. Their delirium continues, and they 
go on with the war, but the speech betrays a manifest expectation that Spain will join against them, 
and the debates betray a dread of Holland. They 
have reason for both. They have not and cannot get 
an ally. They cannot send any considerable reinforcement to America. 
</p><p>
Your reflections upon the rewards of the virtuous 
friends of the public are very just. But if virtue was 
to be rewarded with wealth, it would not be virtue. If 
virtue was to be rewarded with fame, it would not be 
virtue of the sublimest kind. Who would not rather 
be Fabricius than Csesar ? Who would not rather be 
Aristides than even William the Third ? Who ! No 
body would be of this mind but Aristides and Fabricius. These characters are very rare, but the more 
precious. Nature has made more insects than birds, 
more butterflies than eagles, more foxes than lions, 
more pebbles than diamonds. The most excellent of 
her productions both in the physical, intellectual and 
moral world, are the most rare. I would not be a 
butterfly because children run after them, nor because 
dull philosophers boast of them in their cabinets. 
</p><p>
Have you ever read J. J. Rousseau ? If not, read him. 
Your cousin Smith has him. What a difference between him and Chesterfield and even Voltaire ? But 
he was too virtuous for the age and for Europe. I wish I could not say for another country. 
</p><p>
I am much disappointed in not receiving despatches from Congress by this opportunity. We expect alterations in the plan here. What will be done 
with me I can t conjecture. If I am recalled, I 
will endeavor to get a safe opportunity home. I 
will watch the proper season, and look out for a good 
vessel. And if I can get safe to Penn's hill, shall 
never repent of my voyage to Europe, because I have 
gained an insight into several things that I never 
should have understood without it. 
</p><p>
I pray you to remember me with every sentiment 
of tenderness, duty and affection to your father and 
my mother, your and my brothers and sisters, uncles, 
aunts, cousins, and every body else that you know 
deserves it. What shall I say too of my dear young 
friends by your fireside ? May God Almighty bless 
them and make them wise !

THIS moment I had, what shall I say ? the pleasure or the pain of your letter of 25th October. As a letter from my dearest friend it gave me a pleasure that 
it would be in vain to attempt to describe ; but the 
complaints in it gave me more pain than I can express. 
This is the third letter I have received in this com 
plaining style. The former two I have not answered. 
I had endeavored to answer them. I have written 
several answers ; but upon a review, they appeared to 
be such as I could not send. One was angry, another 
was full of grief, and the third with melancholy, so 
that I burnt them all. If you write me in this style, 
I shall leave off writing entirely. It kills me. Can 
profession of esteem be wanting from me to you ? 
Can protestation of affection be necessary ? Can tokens of remembrance be desired ? The very idea of 
this sickens me. Am I not wretched enough in this 
banishment without this ? What course shall I take, 
to convince you that my heart is warm ? You doubt, 
it seems. Shall I declare it ? Shall I swear to it ? 
Would you doubt it the less ? and is it possible you 
should doubt it ? I know it is not. If I could once 
believe it possible, I should not answer for the consequences. But I beg you would never more write to 
me in such a strain, for it really makes me unhappy. 
Be assured, that no time nor place can change my 
heart ; but that I think so often and so much of the 
blessings from which I am separated, as to be too unmindful of those who accompany me ; and that I 
write to you as often as my duty will permit. 
</p><p>
I am extremely obliged to the <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague met acquaintance'>Comte D Estaing</a> and 
his officers for their politeness to you, and am very 
glad you have had an opportunity of seeing so much 
of the French nation. The accounts from all hands 
agree, that there was an agreeable intercourse and 
happy harmony, upon the whole, between the inhabitants and the fleets. The more this nation is known, 
and the more their language is understood, the more 
will narrow prejudices wear away. British fleets and 
armies are very different from their's. In point of 
temperance and politeness, there is no comparison.

because it is done by a hand l as dear to you as to

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
MR. GREENLEAF is about to set off towards Nantes, and from thence to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>.

Last night I walked to Paris and saw the illumination for the birth of the princess Maria Theresa Charlotte, Fille du Roi. Splendid indeed ! My little friend,
who was with me, will write you a description of it. 
</p><p>
The military schools, the hospital of invalids and the 
palace of Bourbon were beautiful and sublime indeed ; 
as much so as an illumination can be. I could scarcely 
have conceived that an illumination could have such 
an effect. I suppose the expense of this is a million 
of livres. As much as I respect this country, particularly the King and royal family, I could not help reflecting how many families in another country would 
this tallow make happy for life ; how many privateers 
would this tallow fit out for chasing away the Jersey- 
men and making reprisals on Messieurs les Anglois. 
But taste will have its way in this country. 
</p><p>
The Queen and her illustrious infant are very well, 
and this nation is very happy to have discovered a 
way by which a dauphin may come to them next year 
or the year after. The King and Queen are greatly 
beloved here. Every day shows fresh proofs of it. 
On the other side the channel there is a King, who is 
in a fair way to be the object of opposite sentiments 
to a nation, if he is not at present. If Keppel should 
be destroyed in life or reputation, I shall expect to 
hear that all restraints are taken off, and passions al 
lowed to sport themselves without reserve. Keppel 
told the King he would not fight against America ; an 
unpardonable offence. He will be ruined if possible. 
However, I think that Keppel was wrong even to accept 
a command against the French. If Britain is wrong in 
this war against America, she is wrong in that against 
the French, for France and America have the same 
object in view and no other. France is right if America is right, because France only assisted the American cause, for which John Bull abused and fought 
her. But John will come off wretchedly. He will be 
beaten. He has been beaten. There have been 
more British men of war already taken and destroyed 
than they lost in two former wars, and more sailors, 
prisoners.

MY DEAREST FRTEND, 
</p><p>
WE wait, and wait, and wait forever, without any 
news from America. We get nothing but what comes 
from England and to other people here, and they 
make it as they please. We have had nothing from 
Congress an immense while. Every merchant and 
every merchant's apprentice has letters and news 
when I have none. In truth, I have been so long 
from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> that every body there, almost, has for 
gotten me. I have expected, every moment for al 
most two months, my recall. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=carlisle' rel='city'>Carlisle</a>, Cornwallis and Eden are arrived in England, but bring no good news for the English, or we 
should have had it in the Gazette. The two houses 
of Parliament join ministry and commissioners in 
threatening fire and sword. They seem to think it 
necessary to threaten most, when they can do least. 
They, however, show their disposition, which they 
will indulge and gratify if they can. But be not dismayed. They can do no great things. Patience, 
perseverance and firmness will overcome all our difficulties. Where the <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague met acquaintance'>Comte D Estaing</a> is, is a great 
mystery. The greater, the better. The English 
fancy he is returning to Europe. But we believe he 
is gone where he will do something. The English 
reproach the French with gasconade, but they never gasconaded as the English do now. I suppose they 
will say as Burgoyne did, " Speak daggers but use 
none." But I believe, however, that they and he 
would use them if they could. Of all the wrong 
heads Johnstone is the most consummate. The Tories 
at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> have filled his head 
with a million lies. He seems to have taken a <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> newspaper for holy writ. Parliament is adjourned to the 14th January. Of this you may be 
assured, that England can et no allies. The new 
secretary at war makes a vast parade of the number 
of men in their service by sea and land. But it is a 
mere delusion. They intend to byngify Keppel to 
all appearance ; but killing him will not mend rotten ships nor make sailors. 
</p><p>
I dined to-day at the Dutchess D Enville's. When I saw the companies of militia on their march to fight her husband, I did not expect this. Did you ?

I WISH you a happy new year and many happy years,

year may be more prosperous for our country than 
any we have seen ? For my own part I have hopes 
that it will. Great blessings are in store for it, and 
they may come this year as well as another. You 
and I, however, must prepare our minds to enjoy the 
prosperity of others, not our own. In poverty and simplicity we shall be happy, whenever our country is so. 
Johnny sends duty. Mr. Williams waits. I knew of 
his going but this moment. I think I shall see you 
this year in spite of British men of war. If it should 
be otherwise ordered, however, we must submit.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
IT is now a year, within a day or two, of my departure from home. It is in vain for me to think of writing of what is passed. The character and situation 
in which I am here, and the situation of public affairs 
absolutely forbid my writing freely. I must be excused. So many vessels are taken, and there are so 
many persons indiscreet, and so many others inquisitive, that I may not write. God knows how much I 
suffer for want of writing to you. It used to be a cordial to my spirits. 
</p><p>
Thus much I can say with perfect sincerity, that I 
have found nothing to disgust me, or in any manner 
disturb me, in the French nation. My evils here 
arise altogether from Americans. If I would have 
enlisted myself under the banner of either party, I 
might have filled America, I doubt not, with panegyrics 
of me from one party, and curses and slanders from 
another. I have endeavored to be hitherto impartial, 
to search for nothing but the truth, and to love no 
body and nothing but the public good, at least not 
more than the public good. I have hoped that animosities might be softened, and the still small voice 
of reason heard more, and the boisterous roar of pas 
sions and prejudices less. But the publication of a 
certain addressto the people has destroyed all such 
hopes. Nothing remains now, but the fearful looking 
for of the fiery indignation of the monster party, 
here. 
</p><p>
My consolation is that the partisans are no more than 
</p><p>
" bubbles on the sea of matter borne, 
They rise, they break, and to that sea return." 
</p><p>
The people of America, I know, stand like Mount 
Atlas, but these altercations occasion a great deal of 
unhappiness for the present, and they prolong the war. 
Those must answer for it who are guilty. I am not.

MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
YOURS of 15th December was sent me yesterday by 
the Marquis, whose praises are celebrated in all the 
letters from America. You must be content to receive 
a short letter, because I have not time now to write a 
long one. I have lost many of your letters, which 
are invaluable to me, and you have lost a vast number of mine. Barnes, Niles, and many other vessels 
are lost. 
</p><p>
I have received intelligence much more agreeable 
than that of a removal to Holland ; I mean that of 
being reduced to a private citizen, which gives me 
more pleasure than \ ou can imagine. I shall there 
fore soon present before you your own good man. 
Happy happy indeed shall I be, once more to see 
our fireside. I have written before to Mrs. Warren, 
and shall write again now. Dr. J. is transcribing your 
Scotch song, which is a charming one. Oh, my 
leaping heart ! 
</p><p>
I must not write a word to you about politics, be 
cause you are a woman. 
</p><p>
What an offence have I committed ! A woman ! 
</p><p>
I shall soon make it up. I think women better 
than men, in general, and I know, that you can keep a 
secret as well as any man whatever. But the world 
don t know this. Therefore if I were to write my 
sentiments to you, and the letter should be caught 
and hitched into a newspaper, the world would say, I 
was not to be trusted with a secret. 
</p><p>
I never had so much trouble in my life as here, 
and yet I grow fat. The climate and soil agree with 
me. So do the cookery and even the manners of the 
people, of those of them at least that I converse with, 
churlish republican as some of you on your side 
the water call me. The English have got at me in 
their newspapers. They make fine work of me 
fanatic, bigot, perfect cipher, not one word of the 
language, awkward figure, uncouth dress, no address, 
no character, cunning, hard-hearted attorney ; but the 
falsest of it all is, that I am disgusted with the Parisians. Whereas I admire the Parisians prodigiously. 
They are the happiest people in the world, I believe, 
and have the best disposition to make others so. If I 
had your ladyship and our little folks here, and no 
politics to plague me, and a hundred thousand livres 
a year rent, I should be the happiest being on earth. 
</p><p>
Nay, I believe I could make it do with twenty thousand. 
</p><p>
One word of politics. The English reproach the 
French with gasconade, but I don t believe their 
whole history could produce so much of it as the 
English have practised this war. The commissioners proclamation with its sanction from the ministry 
and ratification by both houses, I suppose is hereafter 
to be interpreted like Burgoyne's, " Speaking daggers 
but using none." They cannot send any considerable reinforcement, nor get an ally in Europe. This, 
I think, you may depend upon. Their artifice in 
throwing out such extravagant threats was so gross, 
that I presume it has not imposed on any. Yet a nation that regarded its character never could have 
threatened in that manner. 
</p><p>
Adieu.

IN the margin are the dates of all the letters I have received from you. I have written you several times that number. They are almost all lost, I suppose by 
yours. But you should consider, it is a different 
thing to have five hundred correspondents and but 
one. It is a different thing to be under an absolute 
restraint and under none. It would be an easy thing 
for me to ruin you and your children by an indiscreet 
letter, and what is more, it would be easy to throw 
our country into convulsions. For God's sake never 
reproach me again with not writing or with writing 
scrips. Your wounds are too deep. You know not, 
you feel not the dangers that surround me, nor those 
that may be brought upon our country. Millions 
would not tempt me to write you as I used. I have 
no security that every letter I write you will not be 
broken open, and copied, and transmitted to Congress 
and to English newspapers. They would find no 
treason nor deceit in them, it is true, but they would 
find weakness and indiscretion, which they would 
make as ill a use of. 
</p><p>
There are spies upon every word I utter, and every 
syllable I write. Spies planted by the English, spies 
planted by stockjobbers, spies planted by selfish 
merchants, and spies planted by envious and malicious politicians. I have been all along aware of this, 
more or less, but more so now than ever. PJy life 
has been often in danger, but I never considered my 
reputation and character so much in danger as now. 
I can pass for a fool, but I will not pass for a dishonest or a mercenary man. Be upon your guard, there 
fore. I must be upon mine, and I will.

A NEW commission has arrived by which the Dr. is 
sole minister. Mr. Lee continues commissioner for 
Spain, but I am reduced to the condition of a private 
citizen. The Congress have not taken the least notice 
of me. On the 11th of September they resolved to 
have one minister only in France. On the 14th they 
chose the Dr. In October they made out his com 
mission, the Alliance sailed on the 14th January, and 
in all that interval they never so much as bid me 
come home, bid me stay, or told me I had done well 
or done ill. Considering the accusation against Mr. Lee,how unexpected it was, and how groundless it 
is, I should not be at all surprised if I should see an 
accusation against me for something or other, I know 
not what, but I see that all things are possible. 
</p><p>
Of all the scenes I ever passed through, this is the 
most extraordinary. The delirium among Ameri 
cans here is the most extravagant. All the infernal 
arts of stockjobbers, all the voracious avarice of 
merchants have mingled themselves with American 
politics here, disturbed their operations, distracted 
our councils, and turned our heads. 
</p><p>
The Congress, I presume, expect that I should come 
home, and I shall come accordingly. As they have 
no business for me in Europe, I must contrive to get 
some for myself at home. Prepare yourself for re 
moving to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, into the old house, for there you 
shall go, and there I will draw writs and deeds, and 
harangue juries, and be happy.

YOURS by Mr. Williams I have received. The little 
bill must be paid, but I confess it alarms me a little. 
The expense of my son here is greater than I ever 
imagined. Although his company is almost all the 
pleasure I have in life, yet I should not have brought 
him if I had known the expense. His expenses, together with what you have drawn for, and a little collection of books I have bought, will amount to more 
than will ever be allowed me. My accounts must 
not be drawn into intricacy or obscurity. I must not 
be involved in suspicions of meddling in trade, or any 
thing else but my proper business. 
</p><p>
You complain that I don t write often enough, and 
that when I do, my letters are too short. If I were 
to tell you all the tenderness of my heart, I should 
do nothing but write to you. I beg of you not to be uneasy. I write you as often and as much as I ought. 
If I had a heart at ease, and leisure enough, I could 
write you several sheets a day, of the curiosities of this 
country. But it is as much impossible for me to think 
of such subjects as to work miracles. Let me entreat 
you to consider, if some of your letters had by any 
accident been taken, what a figure would they have 
made in a newspaper, to be read by the whole world ? 
Some of them, it is true, would have done honor to 
the most virtuous and most accomplished Roman matron ; but others of them would have made you and 
me very ridiculous. In one of yours you hint that I 
am to go to Holland. But I think you must be misinformed. By all that I can learn, some gentlemen 
intend to vote for me to Holland vs. Mr. D. ; others 
to Spain vs. Mr. Lee. Neither, I think, will succeed ; 
and therefore I think I have but one course to steer, 
and that is, homewards. But I can determine nothing 
absolutely. I must govern myself according to the 
intelligence which may hereafter arise, the orders of 
Congress and the best judgment I can form of my 
own duty and the public good. 
</p><p>
I am advised to take a ride to Geneva, or to <a href='/results.php?city=amsterdam' rel='city'>Amsterdam</a> ; and I have been so confined from exercise, having never been further from Paris than Versailles since 
my arrival here, that some such excursion seems necessary for my health ; yet I cannot well bear the thought 
of putting the public to an expense merely for the sake 
of my pleasure, health or convenience. Yet my situation here is painful. I never was in such a situation 
before as I am now, and my present feelings are new 
to me. If I should return, and in my absence any 
orders should arrive here for me to execute, in that 
case nobody would be here to execute them, and they 
might possibly fail of success for want of somebody 
with power to perform them ; at least, this may he 
suspected and said and believed. However, upon the 
whole, as Congress have said nothing to me good or 
bad, I have no right to presume that they mean to 
say anything, and therefore, on the whole, it is my 
duty to return by the first opportunity, unless I should 
receive counter orders before that occurs. If ever 
the time should arrive, when I could have a little lei 
sure and a quiet mind, I could entertain you with ac 
counts of things which would amuse you and your 
children. There are an infinity of curiosities here, 
but so far from having leisure to describe them, I have 
found none even to see them, except a very few. 
</p><p>
The climate here is charming. The weather is 
every day pleasant as the month of May ; soft, mild 
air ; some foggy days, and about ten or twelve days 
in January were cold and icy. But we have had 
scarce three inches of snow the whole winter. The 
climate is more favorable to my constitution than 
ours. The cookery and manner of living here, which 
you know Americans were taught by their former ab 
surd masters to dislike, is more agreeable to me than 
you can imagine. The manners of the people have 
an affection in them that is very amiable. There is 
such a choice of elegant entertainments in the theatric way, of good company, and excellent books, 
that nothing would be wanting to me in this country 
but my family and peace to my country, to make me 
one of the happiest of men. John Bull would growl 
and bellow at this description. Let him bellow if he 
will, for he is but a brute.

THE weather continuing fine, I went to Saint Denis, 
a little village about eight miles from this place, 
where are the tombs of all the kings and queens. 
The statues of all lie in state in marble. The church 
is called the royal Church of Saint Denis, is magnificent, and there is an apartment in a chamber, where 
the crowns and many other curiosities are preserved. 
It is curious to see such a collection of gold, ivory 
and precious stones ; as there is every species, I sup 
pose, that is mentioned in the Revelation. The diamonds and rubbies glitter. But I confess I have so 
much of the savage sachem in me, that these things 
make no great impression upon me. There are several little crucifixes here, which the ecclesiastic, who 
showed them, told us, were made of bits of the true 
cross. This may be, for any thing that I know. 
</p><p>
In my return, I took a circuit round by Montmartre, 
and dined at home with the Dr., who has a fit of the 
gout, but is getting better. 
</p><p>
The situation in which my masters have left me 
puzzles me very much. They have said nothing to 
me. But one set of gentlemen write that I am to go 
to Spain, another to Holland, a third to Vienna ; but, 
upon the whole, I believe they don t intend to send 
me to either, but leave me to stay here in a ridiculous 
situation, or return home if I can get there. I shall 
return unless I should receive, before the time arrives 
for the vessel to sail, orders which I can execute with 
honor, and with a prospect of rendering some service 
to the public. But of these two last points, I will 
judge for myself.

MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
WHEN I left Paris, the 8th of March, I expected to 
have been at home before this day, and have done 
my utmost to get to sea, but the embarrassments and 
disappointments I have met with have been many, 
very many. I have, however, in the course of them, 
had a fine opportunity of seeing Nantes, L Orient 
and Brest, as well as the intermediate country. 
</p><p>
By the gracious invitation of the King, I am now 
to take passage in his frigate, the Sensible, with his 
new Ambassador to America, the Chevalier de la Luzerne. I hope to see you in six or seven weeks. 
Never was any man in such a state of uncertainty 
and suspense as I have been from last October, entirely uninformed of the intentions of Congress concerning me. This would not have been very painful 
to me if I could have got home. Your conversation 
is a compensation to me for all other things. 
</p><p>
My son has had a great opportunity to see this 
country ; but this has unavoidably retarded his education in some other things. He has enjoyed perfect 
health, from first to last, and is respected wherever 
he goes, for his vigor and vivacity both of mind and 
body, for his constant good humor, and for his rapid 
progress in French as well as his general knowledge, 
which, for his age, is uncommon. I long to see his 
sister and brothers. I need not add

enough, as usual. Pray strive not to have too much. 
I will write by every opportunity I can get.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
WE have had an escape again ; J but are arrived safely in Spain. As the frigate will probably not get 
from this place these two months, I must go by land 
to Paris, which I suppose is a journey of between 
three and four hundred leagues. That part of it 
</p><p>
1 The frigate sprung a leak, and was compelled to make for 
the first harbor, which proved to be <a href='/results.php?city=ferrol' rel='city'>Ferrol</a>, in Spain. 
which is in Spain is very mountainous. No post, bad 
roads, bad taverns, and very dear. We must ride mules, 
horses not being to be had. I must get some kind 
of carriage for the children, if possible. They are 
very well. Charles has sustained the voyage and 
behaves as well as ever his brother did. He is much 
pleased with what he sees. Sammy Cooper, too, is 
very well. These young gentlemen give me a vast 
deal of trouble in this unexpected journey. I have 
bought a dictionary and grammar, and they are learning the Spanish language as fast as possible. What 
could we do, if you and all the family were with 
me ? 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=ferrol' rel='city'>Ferrol</a> is a magnificent port and harbor. It is fortified by nature, by rows of lofty rocky mountains on 
each side the narrow entrance of it, and the public 
works, the fortifications, barracks, arsenals, &c., 
which are of stone very like <a href='/results.php?city=braintree' rel='city'>Braintree</a> stone, exceed any thing I have seen. I dined the day before yesterday with Don Joseph Saint Vincent, the Lieutenant General of the Marine, who is the commandant of this 
port, with four and twenty French and Spanish officers. 
The difference between gravity and gaiety was an amusing speculation. Yesterday, I dined on board the Triomphant, an eighty-gun French ship, commanded by 
the Chef d Escadre, M. Sade, and have engagements 
for every day for a much longer time than I shall 
stay. The French consul and vice consul have been 
particularly polite and obliging to me. In short, I 
never was better pleased with a reception at any 
place. 
There is no news. Nothing has been done in Eu 
rope. England is as insolent in language as ever; 
but this is only ridiculous, as it is apparently impotent.

THE French consul had agreed to carry me, Mr. Dana, Mr. Allen, and my three children and our three 
servants, this day to <a href='/results.php?city=corunna' rel='city'>Corunna</a>, which is about five 
leagues from this place, by water, in a barge of four 
teen oars, but the weather proved so boisterous that 
it was impossible to go. 
</p><p>
To give you some idea of the place where we are, 
Cape Finisterre and Cape Ortegal are two long arms 
of land stretched out into the sea, which embrace a 
large body of water. Within this bay are two other 
points of land, within one of which is <a href='/results.php?city=ferrol' rel='city'>Ferrol</a>, where 
we now are, and within the other is <a href='/results.php?city=corunna' rel='city'>Corunna</a>, where 
we intended to have gone this day, if the weather had 
permitted ; but we hope to go tomorrow. We can 
get neither horses, nor mules, nor carriages, in this 
place, for ourselves or our baggage, which I am much 
surprised at, as it is so grand a port. Living and conveniences for conveyance are very dear in this place, 
which will run my expenses very high. There is 
nothing remarkable here but the natural strength of 
the place and the artificial fortifications, together with 
the arsenals, dry docks, barracks and military matters by sea and land. The city is small, not very 
well built nor accommodated. Very little commerce 
or manufactures, industry or diversions. There are 
two or three elegant churches, and there is an Italian 
opera. There is the appearance of much devotion, 
and there are many ecclesiastics. 
</p><p>
It is dull enough to be in a country, so wholly ignorant of the language and usages ; but we have furnished ourselves with a dictionary and grammar, and 
are learning every hour. Charles is much pleased 
with what he sees and hears, and behaves very discreetly. John is writing to you and his sister and 
brother. I excused myself from dining today on 
board the Souverain and on board the Jason, two 
French men-of-war. Yesterday I dined on board the Triomphant, and the children on board the Jason. 
The French officers appear today with cockades in 
honor of the triple alliance a large white ribbon 
for the French, a smaller red one for the Spaniards, 
and a black one for the Americans, which makes a 
pretty appearance. 
</p><p>
Upon looking a little into the Spanish language, I 
find it so very nearly like the Latin, that I am persuaded we shall learn more of it in a month than we 
did of French in half a year. The manners of the 
Spaniards and French are as opposite as grave and 
gay. The dress of the Spanish officers is much like 
the French. That of the people a little different. 
Men and women, gentlemen and ladies, are very fond 
of long hair, which often reaches, braided in a queue 
or bound round with a black ribbon, almost to their 
hams. The ladies wear cloaks, black or white, which 
come over their heads and shoulders and reach down 
to their waists. They have fine black eyes, and con 
sequently dark, but yet lively complexions. 
</p><p>
When, O when shall I see you again and live in 
peace ? 
</p><p>
The Russian ambassador lately appointed to relieve 
the one lately in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, passed through France and 
was a fortnight or three weeks at Paris, from whence 
the shrewd politicians have conjectured that peace 
was about to be mediated by that power. But it is 
said that England is as reluctant to acknowledge the 
independence of America as to cede Gibraltar, the 
last of which is insisted upon as well as the first. 
But this is only bruit.

MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
LAST night we all arrived in this place from <a href='/results.php?city=ferrol' rel='city'>Ferrol</a>. 
The distance is about twenty miles by land, over high 
mountains and bad roads. You would have been diverted to have seen us all mounted upon our mules 
and marching in train. From the mountains we had 
all along the prospect of a rich, fertile country, cultivated up to the tops of the highest hills and down to 
the very edge of water, all along the shore. 
</p><p>
I made my visit last night to the governor of the 
province, who resides here, and to the governor of 
the town, and was politely received by both. I have 
a long journey before me of a thousand miles, I sup 
pose, at least, to Paris. Through this kingdom we 
shall have bad roads and worse accommodations. I 
don t expect to be able to get to Paris in less than 
thirty days. I shall have an opportunity of seeing 
Spain, but it will be at a great expense. I am advised 
by every body to go by land. The frigate, the Sensible, is in so bad condition as to make it probable 
she will not be fit to put to sea in less than three or 
four weeks, perhaps five or six ; and then we should 
have the storms and enemies of the Bay of Biscay to 
escape or encounter. After this wandering way of 
life is passed, I hope to return to my best friend and 
pass the remainder of our days in quiet. 
</p><p>
I cannot learn that Great Britain is yet in temper 
to listen to propositions of peace, and I don t expect 
before another winter to have much to do in my present capacity. My tenderest affection to our dear 
children, and believe me 
</p><p>
Ever yours.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
WE arrived here last night, all alive, but all very near 
sick with violent colds taken on the road for want of 
comfortable accommodations. I was advised on all 
hands to come by land rather than wait an uncertain 
time for a passage by sea. But if I had known the 
difficulties of travelling in that part of Spain which I 
have passed through, I think I should not have ventured upon the journey. It is in vain to attempt a 
description of our passage. Through the province of 
Gallicia, and again when we came to that of Biscay, 
we had an uninterrupted succession of mountains ; 
through that of Leon and the old Castile, constant 
plains. A country tolerably good by nature, but not 
well cultivated. Through the whole of the journey 
the taverns were inconvenient to us, because there 
are no chimneys in their houses, and we had cold 
weather. A great part of the way, the wretchedness 
of our accommodation exceeds all description. 
</p><p>
At <a href='/results.php?city=bilboa' rel='city'>Bilboa</a> we fare very well, and have received 
much civility from Messrs. Gardoqui and Sons, as we 
did at <a href='/results.php?city=ferrol' rel='city'>Ferrol</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=corunna' rel='city'>Corunna</a> from M. de Tournelle and 
M. Lagoanere. I wish I could send you some few 
things for the use of the family from hence, but the 
risk is such, that I believe I had better wait until we 
get to France. I have undergone the greatest anxiety for the children through a tedious journey and 
voyage. I hope their travels will be of service to 
them, but those at home are best off. My love to 
them.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE the honor to be lodged here with no less a 
personage than the Prince of Hesse Cassel, who is 
here upon a visit. We occupy different apartments 
in the same house, and have no intercourse with each 
other, to be sure ; but some wags are of opinion, that 
if I were authorized to open a negotiation with him, 
I might obtain from him as many troops to fight on 
our side of the question as he has already hired out 
to the English against us. 
</p><p>
I have found every thing agreeable here as yet. 
The children are happy in their academy, of which I 
send you the plan enclosed. 
</p><p>
The English bounce a great deal about obtaining 
seven thousand troops from the petty German princes 
and ten thousand from Ireland to send to America, 
but this is only a repetition of their annual gasconade. 
We are in pain for <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, S. C., being apprehensive that they have made or will make an effort to 
obtain that ; which will be a terrible misfortune to 
that people, and a great loss to the United States, but 
will be no lasting advantage to our enemies. 
</p><p>
The channel of correspondence you propose, by 
way of <a href='/results.php?city=bilboa' rel='city'>Bilboa</a> and Cadiz, will bring many letters no 
doubt, and I have received one of the 10th of December, but the postage is so expensive, being 
obliged to pay forty-four livres for the packet that 
came with yours, that I would not advise you to send 
any thing that way, unless it be a single letter or any 
thing material in the journals of Congress, or letters 
from my friends in Congress or elsewhere, that contain 
any thing particularly interesting. The house of Joseph Gardoqui and Sons have sent to you, by Captain Babson, of <a href='/results.php?city=newburyport' rel='city'>Newburyport</a>, belonging to Mr. Tracy, 
some necessaries for the family, and you may write to Mr. Gardoqui for any thing you want by any vessel belonging to your uncle, to Mr. Jackson, or Mr. Tracy, provided you don t exceed one hundred dollars by any one vessel. Mr. Gardoqui will readily send them and draw upon me for the money. 
</p><p>
I had a great deal of pleasure in the acquaintance 
of this family of Guardoquis, and was treated by 
them with the magnificence of a prince. They will 
be very glad to be useful to you in any thing they 
can do. You will remember, however, that we have 
many children, and that our duty to them requires 
that we should manage all our affairs with the strictest economy. My journey through Spain has been 
infinitely expensive to me, and exceeded far my in 
come. It is very expensive here, and I fear that I 
shall find it difficult to make both ends meet ; but I 
must and will send you something for necessary use 
by every opportunity. If Mr. Lovell does not pro 
cure me the resolution of Congress I mentioned to 
him, that of drawing on a certain gentleman or his 
banker, I shall soon be starved out. Pray mention it 
to him. 
</p><p>
I shall write as often as possible, but conveyances 
will be very rare, I fear. 
</p><p>
I am, as I ever was and ever shall be, 
</p><p>
Yours, yours, yours.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE children made me a visit to-day, and went with 
me to dine with my old friends, the two Abbes, whom 
you have often heard me mention, Chalut and Arnoux, who desire me to mention them to you in my 
letters as devoted friends of America, and particular 
friends to me and to you, notwithstanding the difference of religion. The children are still in good 
health and spirits, and well pleased with their academy. Ah ! how much pain have these young gentle men cost me within these three months ! The mountains, the cold, the mules, the houses without chimneys or windows, the will not add. I wish for 
</p><p>
a painter to draw me and my company mounted on muleback, or riding in the calashes, or walking, for we 
walked one third of the way. Yet by the help of 
constant care and expense, I have been able to get 
them all safe to Paris. The other moiety of the family is quite as near my heart, and therefore I hope 
they will never be ramblers. I am sick of rambling. 
If I could transport the other moiety of the family 
across the Atlantic with a wish, and be sure of returning them, when it should become necessary, in the 
same manner, how happy should I be ! 
</p><p>
I have been received here with much cordiality, and am daily visited by characters who do me much 
honor. Some day or other you will know, I believe, but I had better not say at present. Your friend, the <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague met acquaintance'>Comte D Estaing</a>, however, I ought to mention, because you have been acquainted with him. I have 
dined with him, and he has visited me and I him, and I hope to have many more conversations with him, 
for public reasons, not private, for on a private account great men and little are much alike to me. 
</p><p>
Mr. Lee and Mr. Izard are going home in the Alliance, and, I hope, will make you a visit. How 
many vicissitudes they are to experience, as well as 
I and all the rest of our countrymen, I know not. 
The events of politics are not less uncertain than those 
of war. Whatever they may be, I shall be content. 
Of one thing I am pretty sure, that if I return again 
safe to America, I shall be happy the remainder of 
my days, because I shall stay at home, and at home 
I must be to be happy. There is no improbability 
that I may be obliged to come home again soon, for 
want of means to stay here. I hope, however, care 
will be taken that something may be done to supply 
us. My tenderest affection to Abby and Tommy. 
They are better off than their brothers, after all. I 
have been taking measures to send home your things. 
I hope to succeed by the Alliance. It shall not be 
my fault, if I do not. If I cannot send by her, I will 
wait for another frigate, if it is a year, for I have no 
confidence in other vessels. 
</p><p>
Yours, forever yours.

MY DEAR PORTIA. [<a href='/results.php?year=1780' rel="origin">1780</a>]
</p><p>
THE enclosed dialogue in the shades was written by 
Mr. Edmund Jennings, now residing at Brussels, a 
native of Maryland. I will send you the rest when 
I can get it. How I lament the loss of my packets 
by Austin! There were, I suppose, letters from 
</p><p> 
Congress of great importance to me. I know not 
what I shall do without them. I suppose there was 
authority to draw, etc. Mr. T.'s letter from his 
father hints that Mr. L. is coming here. This will be 
excellent. 
</p><p>
Since my arrival this time, I have driven about 
Paris more than I did before. The rural scenes 
around this town are charming. The public walks, 
gardens, &c., are extremely beautiful. The gardens 
of the Palais Royal and the gardens of the Tuileries are 
very fine. The Place de Louis XV., the Place Vendome or Place de Louis XIV., the Place Victoire, the 
Place Royale, are fine squares, ornamented with very 
magnificent statues. I wish I had time to describe 
these objects to you, in a manner that I should have 
done twenty-five years ago, but my head is too full 
of schemes, and my heart of anxiety, to use expres 
sions borrowed from you know whom. To take a 
walk in the gardens of the palace of the Tuileries, 
and describe the statues there, all in marble, in which 
the ancient divinities and heroes are represented with 
exquisite art, would be a very pleasant amusement and 
instructive entertainment, improving in history, mythology, poetry, as well as in statuary. Another 
walk in the gardens of Versailles would be useful 
and agreeable. But to observe these objects with 
taste and describe them, so as to be understood, would 
require more time and thought than I can possibly 
spare. It is not indeed the fine arts which our 
country requires ; the useful, the mechanic arts, are 
those which we have occasion for in a young country 
, as yet simple and not far advanced in luxury, 
although perhaps much too far for her age and 
character. I could fill volumes with descriptions of 
temples and palaces, paintings, sculptures, tapestry, 
porcelain, &c., &c., &c., if I could have time ; but I 
could not do this without neglecting my duty. The 
science of government, it is my duty to study, more 
than all other sciences ; the arts of legislation and 
administration and negotiation, ought to take place of, 
indeed to exclude, in a manner, all other arts. I must 
study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. My sons 
ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history and naval architecture, navigation, 
commerce and agriculture, in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and porcelain.

MY DEAR PORTIA, [<a href='/results.php?year=1780' rel="origin">1780</a>]
</p><p>
YESTERDAY we went to see the garden of the King, Jardin du Roi, and his cabinet of natural history, 
cabinet d histoire naturelle. The cabinet of natural history is a great collection of metals, minerals, shells, insects, birds, beasts, fishes and precious 
stones. They are arranged in good order and pre 
served in good condition, with the name of every 
thing, beautifully written on a piece of paper, annexed 
to it. There is also a collection of woods and marbles. The garden is large and airy, affording fine 
walks between rows of trees. Here is a collection, 
from all parts of the world, of all the plants, roots 
and vegetables that are used in medicine, and indeed 
of all the plants and trees in the world. A fine scene 
for the studious youths in physic and philosophy. It 
was a public day. There was a great deal of company, and I had opportunity only to take a cursory 
view. The whole is very curious. There is a hand 
some statue of M. Buffon, the great natural historian, 
whose works you have, whose labors have given fame 
to this cabinet and garden. When shall we have in 
America such collections ? The collection of American curiosities that I saw at Norwalk, in Connecticut, 
made by <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel=''>Mr. Arnold</a>, which he afterwards, to my 
great mortification, sold to Governor Tryon, convinces me that our country affords as ample materials 
for collections of this nature as any part of the world. 
</p><p>
Five midshipmen of the Alliance came here last 
night, Marston, Hogan, Fitzgerald, and two others, 
from Norway, where they were sent with prizes, 
which the court of Denmark were absurd and unjust 
enough to restore to the English. They, however, 
treated the officers and people well, and defrayed 
their expenses. They say the Norwegians were 
very angry with the court of Copenhagen for delivering up these vessels. It was the blunder of ignorance, I believe, rather than any ill will. 
</p><p>
Every day, when I ride out without any particular 
business to do or visit to make, I order my servant to 
carry me to some place where I never was before, so 
that, at last, I believe, I have seen all Paris and all 
the fields and scenes about it that are near it. It is 
very pleasant. Charles is as well beloved here as at 
home. Wherever he goes every body loves him. 
Mr. Dana is as fond of him, I think, as I am. He 
learns very well. 
</p><p>
There is a volume in folio just published here, 
which I yesterday ran over at a bookseller's shop. 
It is a description and a copper-plate of all the engravings upon precious stones in the collection of 
the Duke of Orleans. The stamps are extremely 
beautiful, and are representations of the gods and 
heroes of antiquity, with most of the fables of their 
mythology. Such a book would be very useful to 
the children in studying the classics, but it is too 
dear ; three guineas unbound. There is every thing 
here that can inform the understanding or refine the 
taste, and indeed, one would think, that could purify 
the heart. Yet it must be remembered, there is every 
thing here, too, which can seduce, betray, deceive, 
deprave, corrupt and debauch it. Hercules marches 
here in full view of the steeps of virtue on one hand 
and the flowery paths of pleasure on the other, and 
there are few who make the choice of Hercules. 
That my children may follow his example is my ear 
nest prayer ; but I sometimes tremble when I hear 
the siren song of sloth, lest they should be captivated with her bewitching charms, and her soft, insinuating music.

MY DEAR PORTIA, 
</p><p>
I YESTERDAY received a letter of the 26th of April 
from brother Cranch, for which I thank him and will 
answer as soon as possible. He tells me you have 
drawn a little bill upon me. I am sorry for it, be 
cause I have sent and should continue to send you 
small presents, by which you would be enabled to do 
better than by drawing bills. I would not have you 
draw any more. I will send you things which will 
defray your expenses better. The machine is horribly dear. Mr. C. desires to know if he may draw on 
me. I wish it was in my power to oblige him, but it 
is not. I have no remittances, nor any thing to depend 
on. Not a line from Congress, nor any member, since 
I left you. My expenses through Spain were beyond 
all imagination, and my expenses here are so exorbitant, that I can t answer any bill from any body, not 
even from you, excepting the one you have drawn. 
I must beg you to be as prudent as possible. Depend 
upon it, your children will have occasion for all your 
economy. Mr. Johonnot must send me some bills. 
Every farthing is expended and more. You can 
have no idea of my unavoidable expenses. I know- 
not what to do. Your little affairs and those of all 
our friends, Mr. Wibird, &c., are on board the Alii-, and have been so these four months, or ready 
to be. Pray write me by way of Spain and Holland, 
as well as France. We are all well. My duty to 
your father, my mother, and affection and respects 
where due. My affections, I fear, got the better of 
my judgment in bringing my boys. They behave 
very well, however. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> is in the horrors. Governor Hutchinson fell 
down dead at the first appearance of mobs. They 
have been terrible. A spirit of bigotry and fanaticism mixing with the universal discontents of the nation has broken out into violences of the most dreadful nature, burned Lord Mansfield's house, books, 
manuscripts ; burned the king's bench prison and 
all the other prisons, let loose all the debtors and criminals, tore to pieces Sir George Saville's house, insulted all the lords of Parliament, &c., &c. Many 
have been killed, martial law proclaimed, many 
hanged. Lord George Gordon committed to the 
Tower for high treason, and where it will end, God 
only knows. The mobs all cried, peace with America, and war with France. Poor wretches ! as if this were possible ! 
</p><p>
In the English papers they have inserted the death 
of Mr. Hutchinson with severity, in these words. 
" Governor Hutchinson is no more. On Saturday last 
he dropped down dead. It is charity to hope that his 
sins will be buried with him in the tomb, but they must 
be recorded in his epitaph. His misrepresentations 
have contributed to the continuance of the war with 
America. Examples are necessary. It is to be 
hoped that all will not escape into the grave with 
out a previous appearance either on a gibbet or a 
scaffold." 
</p><p>
Governor Bernard, I am told, died last fall. I wish 
that, with these primary instruments of the calamities 
that now distress almost all the world, the evils them 
selves may come to an end. For although they will 
undoubtedly end in the welfare of mankind, and accomplish the benevolent designs of providence towards 
the two worlds, yet, for the present, they are not joyous but grievous. May heaven permit you and me 
to enjoy the cool evening of life in tranquillity, undisturbed by the cares of politics or war, and above all, 
with the sweetest of all reflections, that neither ambition nor vanity, nor avarice, nor malice nor envy, nor 
revenge nor fear, nor any base motive or sordid passion through the whole course of this mighty revolution, and the rapid, impetuous course of great and 
terrible events that have attended it, have drawn us 
aside from the line of our duty and the dictates of 
our consciences. Let us have ambition enough to 
keep our simplicity or frugality, and our integrity, and 
transmit these virtues as the fairest of inheritances to i 
our children.

MY DEAR PORTIA, 
</p><p>
I WISH you to write me by every opportunity to this 
place as well as to France. It seems as if I never 
should get any more letters from America. I have 
sent you some things by Captain Davis, but he has no 
arms and I fear they will be lost by capture. I sent 
things by the Alliance. 
</p><p>
The country where I am is the greatest curiosity in 
the world. This nation is not known any where, not 
even by its neighbors. The Dutch language is 
spoken by none but themselves. Therefore they 
converse with nobody, and nobody converses with 
them. The English are a great nation, and they despise the Dutch because they are smaller. The 
French are a greater nation still, and therefore they 
despise the Dutch because they are still smaller in 
comparison to them. But I doubt much whether there 
is any nation of Europe more estimable than the 
Dutch in proportion. Their industry and economy 
ought to be examples to the world. They have less 
ambition, I mean that of conquest and military glory, 
than their neighbors, but I don t perceive that they 
have more avarice. And they carry learning and 
arts, I think, to greater extent. The collections of 
curiosities, public and private, are innumerable. 
I am told that Mr. Searle is arrived at Brest ; but I 
have learned nothing from him as yet, nor do I know 
his destination. The French and Spanish fleets have 
made a sweep of sixty upon the English East India 
and West India fleets. This must have great effects. 
We are all well. Don t expect peace. The English have not yet forgotten the acquisition of Charles 
ton, for which they are making the most childish exultations. The new parliament will give ministry a 
run. Mark my words, you will have no peace but 
what you give yourselves by destroying, root and 
branch, all the British force in America. The English cannot bear the thought that France should dictate the terms of peace, as they call it. They say 
they must make a dishonorable peace now, a shameful 
peace, a degrading peace. This is worse than death 
to them, and thus they will go on, until they are 
forced to sue for a peace still more shameful and humiliating.

MY DEAREST PORTIA, 
</p><p>
I HAVE this morning sent Mr. Thaxter with my two 
sons to Leyden, there to take up their residence for 
some time, and there to pursue their studies of Latin 
and Greek under the excellent masters, and there to 
attend lectures of the celebrated professors, in that 
university. It is much cheaper there than here. 
The air is infinitely purer, and the company and conversation are better. It is perhaps as learned a university as any in Europe. 
</p><p>
I should not wish to have children educated in the 
common schools in this country, where a littleness of 
soul is notorious. The masters are mean spirited 
wretches, pinching, kicking and boxing the children 
upon every turn. There is besides a general littleness 
arising from the incessant contemplation of stivers 
and duits, which pervades the whole people. Frugality and industry are virtues every where, but avarice and stinginess are not frugality. The Dutch say 
that without a habit of thinking of every duit before 
you spend it, no man can be a good merchant, or 
conduct trade with success. This I believe is a just 
maxim in general, but I would never wish to see a son 
of mine govern himself by it. It is the sure and certain 
way for an industrious man to be rich. It is the only 
possible way for a merchant to become the first mer 
chant or the richest man in the place. But this is an 
object that I hope none of my children will ever aim at. 
It is indeed true, every where, that those who attend 
to small expenses are always rich. 
</p><p>
I would have my children attend to duits and far 
things as devoutly as the merest Dutchman upon 
earth, if such attention was necessary to support 
their independence. A man who discovers a disposition and a design to be independent seldom succeeds. 
A jealousy arises against him. The tyrants are 
alarmed on one side lest he should oppose them. 
The slaves are alarmed on the other lest he should 
expose their servility. The cry from all quarters is, 
" He is the proudest man in the world. He cannot 
bear to be under obligation." I never in my life ob 
served any one endeavoring to lay me under particular obligations to him, but I suspected he had a de 
sign to make me his dependent, and to have claims 
upon my gratitude. This I should have no objection 
to, because gratitude is always in one's power. But 
the danger is, that men will expect and require more 
of us than honor and innocence and rectitude will 
permit us to perform. 
</p><p>
In our country, however, any man, with common 
industry and prudence, may be independent. But to 
put an end to this stuff, 
</p><p>
Adieu most affectionately adieu.

MY DEAREST FRIEKD, 
</p><p>
YOUR favors of September 29 and October 21 are 
before me. I avoided saying any thing about Charles 
to save you the anxiety, which I fear you will now 
feel in its greatest severity, a long time. I thought 
he would go directly home in a short passage in the 
best opportunity which would probably ever present. 
But I am disappointed. Charles is at <a href='/results.php?city=bilboa' rel='city'>Bilboa</a> with 
Major Jackson and Colonel Trumbull, who take the 
best care of his education, as well as his health and 
behavior. They are to go hence with Captain Hill in 
a good vessel of twenty guns. Charles's health was 
so much affected by this tainted atmosphere, and he 
had set his heart so much upon going home with Gil- 
Ion, that it would have broken it to have refused him. 
I desire I may never again have the weakness to bring 
a child to Europe. They are infinitely better at home. 
We have all been sick here, myself, Mr. Thaxter, Stevens and another servant, but are all better. Mr. Thaxter's indisposition has been slight and short, mine 
and Stevens's long and severe. 
</p><p>
I beg you would not flatter yourself with hopes of 
peace. There will be no such thing for several years. 
Don t distress yourself neither about any malicious 
attempts to injure me in the estimation of my country 
men. Let them take their course and go the length 
of their tether. They will never hurt your husband, 
whose character is fortified with a shield of innocence 
and honor ten thousand fold stronger than brass or 
iron. The contemptible essays made by you know 
whom will only tend to his own confusion. My letters have shown them their own ignorance, a sight 
they could not bear. Say as little about it as I do. 
It has already brought them into the true system, and 
that system is triumphant. I laugh and will laugh 
before all posterity at their impotent rage and envy. 
They could not help blushing themselves if they were 
to review their conduct. 
</p><p>
Dear Tom, thy letter does thee much honor. Thy 
brother Charles shall teach thee French and Dutch at 
home. I wish I could get time to correspond with 
thee and thy sister more regularly, but I cannot. I 
must trust <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> and thine excellent mamma for 
the education of my children. Mr. Dana and our 
son are well at Petersburg. Hayden has some 
things for you. I hope he is arrived. I am sorry to 
learn you have a sum of paper. How could you be 
so imprudent ? You must be frugal, I assure you. 
Your children will be poorly off. I can but barely 
live in the manner that is indispensably demanded of 
me by every body. Living is dear indeed here. 
My children will not be so well left by their father as 
he was by his. They will be infected with the examples and habits and tastes for expensive living 
without the means. He was not. My children shall 
never have the smallest soil of dishonor or disgrace 
brought upon them by their father, no, not to please 
ministers, kings or nations. At the expense of a little of this, my children might perhaps ride at their 
ease through life, but dearly as I love them, they shall 
live in the service of their country, in her navy, her 
army, or even out of either in the extremest degree of 
poverty, before I will depart in the smallest iota from 
my sentiments of honor and delicacy ; for I, even I, 
have sentiments of delicacy as exquisite as the proudest minister that ever served a monarch. They may 
not be exactly like those of some ministers. 
I beg you would excuse me to my dear friends, to 
whom I cannot write so often as I wish. I have in 
dispensable duties which take up all my time, and re 
quire more than I have. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> has done me great honor and 
much public service by sending me authentic ac 
counts of his own and <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel=''>General Greene</a>'s last great 
actions. They are in the way to negotiate peace. 
It lies wholly with them. No other ministers but 
they and their colleagues in the army can accomplish 
the great event. 
</p><p>
I am keeping house, but I want a housekeeper. 
What a fine affair it would be, if we could flit across 
the Atlantic as they say the angels do, from planet to 
planet ! I would dart to Penn's hill and bring you over 
on my wings ; but, alas, we must keep house separately for some time. But one thing I am determined 
on. If God should please to restore me once more 
to your fireside, I will never again leave it without 
your ladyship's company no, not even to go to Congress at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and there I am determined to 
go, if I can make interest enough to get chosen, when 
ever I return. I would give a million sterling that 
you were here ; and I could afford it as well as Great 
Britain can the thirty millions she must spend, the 
ensuing year, to complete her own ruin. 
</p><p>
Farewell, farewell.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE letters from Mr. Dana and his young attendant at St. Petersburg. Both well and in good spirits. 
Letters to Mrs. Dana and to you go by Captain Trowbridge and by Dr. Dexter. I have no certain news as 
yet of Charles's sailing from <a href='/results.php?city=bilboa' rel='city'>Bilboa</a>, but I presume 
he is sailed. You will have suffered great anxiety on 
his account, but I pray he may arrive safe. I acted 
for the best when I consented he should go with Gil- 
Ion, little expecting that he would be landed in Spain 
again. Keep him to his studies, and send him to 
college, where I wish his brother John was. 
</p><p>
My health is feeble, but better than it was. I am 
busy enough, yet not to much perceptible purpose as 
yet. There is no prospect at all of peace. Let our 
people take care of their trade and privateers next 
year. They have not much of a land war to fear. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> has struck the most sublime 
stroke of all in that article of the capitulation which 
reserves the tories for trial by their peers. This has 
struck toryism dumb and dead. I expect that all the 
rancor of the refugees will be poured out upon Corn- 
wallis for it. Our enemies now really stand in a ridiculous light. They feel it, but cannot take the 
resolution to be wise. The Romans never saw but 
one caudine forks in their whole history. Americans 
have shown the Britons two in one war. But they 
must do more. Remember, you never will have 
peace, while the Britons have a company of soldiers 
at liberty within the United States. <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> must 
be taken, or you will never have peace. All in good time. 
</p><p>
The British army estimates are the same as last 
year. The navy less by several ships of the line. 
What can these people hope for ? I fancy the southern States will hold their heads very high. They 
have a right. They will scarcely be overrun again, I 
believe, even in the hasty manner of Cornwallis. 
Burgoyne don t seem to be affronted that his nose is 
out of joint. He is in good spirits. Experience has 
convinced him, so I hope it has Cornwallis, that the 
American war is impracticable. The flower, the 
choice of the British army was with him. The King 
of England consoles his people under all their dis 
graces, disasters and dismal prospects, by telling them 
that they are brave and free. It is a pity for him that 
he did not allow the Americans to be so seven years 
ago. But the great designs of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> must be 
accomplished. Great indeed ! The progress of so 
ciety will be accelerated by centuries by this revolu 
tion. The Emperor of Germany is adopting, as fast 
as he can, American ideas of toleration and religious 
liberty, and it will become the fashionable system of 
all Europe very soon. Light spreads from the day 
spring in the west, and may it shine more and more 
until the perfect day! Duty to parents. Love to 
brothers, sisters and children. It is not in the power 
of worlds to express the tenderness with which I bid 
you farewell.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
IN this country, as in all others, men are much addicted to " hobby horses." These nags are called in 
the language of the Dutch " Liefhebbery," as they are 
called in French " Marotte." I had rather ride a 
Dutch hobby horse than an English one, or a French. 
It is the wholesomest exercise in the world. They 
live to great age by the strength of it. 
</p><p>
My meaning is this. They pitch in early life upon 
some domestic amusement, which they follow all their 
days at leisure hours. I shall give you the history of 
several. yesterday made a visit to one, aM. Lionet, 
a venerable old man of seventy-five, in full health, 
strength and vivacity, respectable for several offices 
which he holds, but more so for vast learning in various kinds, and great ingenuity. His hobby horse has 
been natural knowledge. We went to see a collection of marine shells. We were two hours, and had 
not got half through. The infinite variety of figures 
and colors is astonishing. 
</p><p>
But his curiosity has not been confined to shells. 
It has extended to insects, and he has had it in contemplation to write as full an account of these, as Buffon has written of birds, beasts and fishes. But 
beginning with caterpillars, he has filled a folio upon 
that species, and he drew and engraved the plates 
himself. Thus he rode his hobby horse and lived. 
Without it he would have died fifty years ago. Have 
you an inclination to read and inspect cuts of the 
anatomy of caterpillars their nerves, blood, juices, 
bones, hair, senses, intellects, &c., &c., their moral 
sense, their laws, government, manners and customs. I 
don t know whether he teaches the manner of destroying them and saving the apple tree. I doubt not 
the book is worth studying. All nature is so. But I 
have too much to do to study men and their mischievous designs upon apple trees and other things, ever to 
be very intimate with Monsieur Lionet (whom I respect 
very much, however,) or his book. 
</p><p>
Adieu.

ALL well you will send these papers to some

We have found that the only way of guarding

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I have transmitted money to the young men whom 
you mentioned to me, and have expected, every day 
for a long time, to hear of their sailing in a cartel for 
America. They have been better treated since the 
change of ministers. My respects to their parents. 
</p><p>
It is now five months since my public reception 
here, but we have not yet learned that any news of it has arrived in America. The refugees in England 
are at their old game again. Andrew Sparhawk 
has published, in the Morning Post, that his brother 
has received a letter from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, that Massachusetts and several other States were upon the point of 
overturning the new government, throwing off the authority of Congress, and returning to the government 
of Great Britain. Their blood-thirsty souls are not 
yet satiated. They are laboring to bring on again an 
offensive war. But I think they can t succeed. I 
suppose the unhappy affair of the county of Hampshire is the thing that gave occasion to this representation. Our countrymen must be very unreasonable if they can t be easy and happy under the government they have. I don t know where they will 
find a better, or how they will make one. I dread 
the consequences of the differences between chiefs. 
If Massachusetts gets into parties, they will worry 
one another very rudely. But I rely on the honesty 
and sobriety as well as good sense of the people. 
These qualities will overawe the passions of individuals and preserve a steady administration of the laws. 
</p><p>
My duty to my mother and to your father. I hope 
to see them again. Love to the children and all 
friends. What shall I say of my brother Cranch ? 
I long, and yet I dread to hear from him. 
</p><p>
I hope to sign the treaty this week or next, or the week after. All points are agreed on, and nothing 
remains but to transcribe the copies fair. This government is so complicated, that months are consumed 
in doing what might be done in another in an hour. 
</p><p>
I don t know what to do with the list of articles 
you send me. It would be better for you to write to Ingraham and Bromfield. I will pay.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YOUR proposal of coming to Europe has long and 
tenderly affected me. The dangers and inconveniences are such, and a European life would be so dis 
agreeable to you, that I have suffered a great deal of 
anxiety in reflecting upon it. And upon the whole, I 
think it will be most for the happiness of my family, 
and most for the honor of our country, that I should 
come home. I have, therefore, this day written to 
Congress a resignation of all my employments, and as 
soon as I shall receive their acceptance of it, I will 
embark for America, which will be in the spring or 
beginning of summer. Our son is now on his journey from Petersburg, through Sweden, Denmark, 
and Germany, and if it please God he come safe, he 
shall come with me, and I pray we may all meet once 
more, you and I never to separate again. 
Yours most tenderly,

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I DARE say there is not a lady in America treated 
with a more curious dish of politics than is contained 
in the enclosed papers. You may show them to dis 
creet friends, but by no means let them go out of your 
hands or be copied. Preserve them in safety against 
accidents. 
</p><p>
I am afraid we shall have another campaign ; but do 
not. despair, however, of a peace this winter. America has nothing to do but to be temperate, patient, 
and faithful to her ally. This is as clearly her duty 
as it is her interest. She could not trust England if 
her honor was not engaged to France, which it is 
most certainly ; and when this is said, all is said. 
Whether there should be peace or war, I shall come 
home in the summer. As soon as I shall receive 
from Congress their acceptance of the resignation of 
all my employments, which I have transmitted many 
ways, I shall embark, and you may depend upon a 
good domestic husband for the remainder of my life, 
if it is the will of heaven that I should once more 
meet you. My promises are not lightly made with 
any body. I have never broken one made to you, 
and I will not begin at this time of life. 
</p><p>
My children, I hope, will once at length discover 
that they have a father, who is not unmindful of their 
welfare. They have had too much reason to think 
themselves forgotten, although I know that an anxiety 
for their happiness has corroded me every day of my 
life.

am theirs and yours forever,

MY DEAREST FRIEND,

THE peace, which sets the rest of the world at ease, 
increases, I think, my perplexities and anxiety. I 
have written to Congress a resignation, but I foresee 
there will not be a speedy decision upon it, and I 
shall be left in a state of suspense that will be intolerable. Foreseeing this, I am determined not to 
wait for an acceptance of my resignation, but to come 
home without it, provided it does not arrive in a reasonable time. Don t think, therefore, of coming to 
Europe. If you do, we shall cross each other, 
and I shall arrive in America about the same time 
that you may arrive in Europe. 
</p><p>
I shall certainly return home in the spring. With 
or without leave, resignation accepted or not, home I 
will come, so you have nothing to do but wait to receive your old friend

It is Montesquieu who draws this picture, and I 
think it is drawn from the life, and is an exact resemblance. You cannot wonder, then, that I am weary, 
and wish to be at home upon almost any terms. 
Your life would be dismal in a high degree, you 
would be in a hideous solitude among millions. None 
of them would be society for you that you could endure. Mrs. Jay is in this situation, ardently longing to 
come home. Yet she is much better circumstanced 
than you are, to be abroad, as her family is smaller 
and younger. You must leave a part of your family. 
</p><p>
No. Let us live in our own country, and in our 
own way, educate our children to be good for some 
thing. Upon no consideration whatever would I have 
any of my children educated in Europe. In con 
science I could not consent to it. 
</p><p>
If Congress had been steady and continued in force 
my commission to make a treaty of commerce with 
Great Britain, I should have gone to <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, and 
have finished the treaty before now ; but I should not 
have thought of residing in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> long. I should 
have resigned and returned to America in a year or 
two at farthest. If Congress should now revive my 
commission and send me a new one, which I think 
altogether improbable, but believe they will complete 
their work by sending another man upon that errand, 
I would not stay longer in England than a year or 
two at farthest. I cannot bear the thought of a long 
banishment from my own native soil where alone I 
can ever be happy or comfortable. 
</p><p>
I write you by every opportunity, lest you should 
embark for Europe when I am upon my passage 
home, which would be a terrible disappointment to 
both. My intention, is to come home, whether I receive the acceptance of my resignation or not, unless 
1 receive a commission to St. James's. Don t you 
embark, therefore, until you receive a letter from 
me desiring you to come. If I should receive such 
a commission, I will write you immediately by way 
of France, Holland and England, and shall wish you 
to come to me on the wings of the wind. But the 
same influence, French influence I mean, which induced Congress to revoke my commission, will still 
continue to prevent the revival of it. And I think it 
likely, too, that English influence will now be added to 
French, for I don t believe that George wishes to see 
my face. In this case I shall enjoy the satisfaction 
of coming, where I wish most to be, with all my 
children, living in simplicity, innocence and repose. 
</p><p>
What I write you upon this subject is in confidence, 
and must not be communicated but with great discretion.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
HERE I am out of all patience. Not a word from 
America. The British ministry lingering on. Mr. Hartley uncertain what to do. No regulation of 
commerce agreed on. No definitive treaty of peace 
signed, nor likely to be signed very soon. My spring 
passage home lost. To embark in July or August 
would be the worst season of the whole year, on ac 
count of heats and calms. I don t see a possibility 
of embarking before September or October. The 
total idleness, the perpetual uncertainty we are in, 
is the most insipid and at the same time disgusting 
and provoking situation imaginable. I had rather be 
employed in carting street dust and marsh mud. 
Neither do I know how or where I shall get a pas 
sage. I could now go with Mr. Van Berckel in a fine 
new sixty-eight gun ship. In the fall, I suppose I 
shall be obliged to step on board a merchant ship 
loaded down to the brim ; but whether from Holland, 
or from some port in France, I know not. So many 
vessels will run away to England that I fear it will 
be difficult to find a passage from France or Holland. 
But we must bear it all if we can. 
</p><p>
Our son is at the <a href='/results.php?city=hague' rel='city'>Hague</a>, pursuing his studies with 
great ardor. They give him a good character wherever he has been, and I hope he will make a good 
man. It is unaccountable that not one vessel should 
have arrived from any part of New England since 
the peace, nor for so long a time before. But all is 
mystery. Pray write me. Don t omit to write, until I arrive home. Direct to the care of Mr. Dumas, 
a r/iotel des Etats Unis d Amerique, at the <a href='/results.php?city=hague' rel='city'>Hague</a>, 
or to the care of <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>, at Paris. These gentle

MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
WHAT would I not give for an arrival from America, 
or for certain advice from <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> of the appointment 
of a ministry, or for the arrival here of a minister to 
sign the definitive treaty ? 
</p><p>
9 June. 
</p><p>
What would I not give for an arrival from America, or for advice from <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> what the ministry in 
tend to do ? Mr. Hartley is now here, but we ad 
vance slowly to the definitive treaty. I can now have 
no hopes of seeing you before late in the fall. If the 
acceptance of my resignation arrives, as I expect, 
and we finish the peace as soon as I can reasonably 
hope, I shall not now be able to embark before October. The affairs of the world have little complaisance for my happiness or yours, but it is not worth our 
while to be impatient, because it will do us no good. 
I am astonished, however, that we have nothing from 
Congress nor from you. If you and your daughter 
were with me, I could keep up my spirits ; but idly 
and insipidly as I pass my time, I am weary, worn, 
and disgusted to death. I had rather chop wood, dig 
ditches and make fence upon my poor little farm. 
Alas, poor farm and poorer family, what have you 
lost, that your country might be free, and that others 
might catch fish and hunt deer and beaver at their 
ease ? 
</p><p>
There will be as few of the tears of gratitude or 
the smiles of admiration or the sighs of pity for us 
as for the army. But all this should not hinder me 
from going over the same scenes again upon the 
same occasion, scenes which I would not encounter 
for all the wealth, pomp and powers of the world. 
Boys ! if you ever say one word or utter one com 
plaint, I will disinherit you. Work, you rogues, and 
be free. You will never have so hard work to do as 
papa has had. Daughter ! get you an honest man for 
a husband and keep him honest. No matter whether 
he is rich, provided he be independent. Regard the 
honor and the moral character of the man, more 
than all other circumstances. Think of no other 
greatness but that of the soul, no other riches but 
those of the heart. An honest, sensible, humane 
man, above all the littlenesses of vanity and extravagances of imagination, laboring to do good rather 
than be rich, to be useful rather than make a show, 
living in a moderate simplicity clearly within his 
means, and free from debts or obligations, is really 
the most respectable man in society, makes himself 
and all about him the most happy. 
</p><p>
I long to see my dear John, as much as the rest, 
but he is well at the <a href='/results.php?city=hague' rel='city'>Hague</a>, and I cannot go to him, 
nor do I think it prudent to bring him to Paris. 
</p><p>
I have accomplished a correspondence between the 
Royal Society of Medicine here and the republican 
one at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, at the desire of Dr. Tufts, but have 
not yet found a careful hand to send the diploma. 
Adieu, adieu, adieu.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE legion of Lauzun has arrived, and we hope 
has brought the orders of Congress for us, but we 
have not yet received them, and are as much at a 
loss as ever. I know not whether my resignation is 
accepted, and consequently can give you no conjecture 
when I shall be able to get away. As the spring and 
summer passage is lost, I cannot now embark before 
September, or October, or November. Whether I 
shall embark from France, Holland, or England, I 
don t know. It will be according as I hear of a convenient passage. Write me by all these ways. I 
have received no line from you dated since December. 
</p><p>
The definitive treaty may be signed in three weeks, 
and it may as probably be trained on till Christmas. In 
the last case, provided the acceptance of my resignation should not arrive, it may be spring before I can 
embark. In this state of suspense and perplexity 
you may well suppose I do not sleep upon a bed of 
roses, especially as the public affairs are as uncertain 
as our private ones. I should like very well to take 
a short tour to <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> before my return, for the sake 
of taking a look at that country, and seeing some personages there, because if I waive this opportunity it 
is not likely I shall ever have another. Once more 
at home, it is not probable I shall again go abroad. 
Indeed, it is more for the sake of Mr. John than for 
my own that I wish to see England at all. 
</p><p>
I was at Versailles the day before yesterday, and 
paid my respects to the King arid Queen, Monsieur 
and Madame his lady, the Comte d Artois, Madame 
Elizabeth, and the Mesdames of France, Adelaide 
and Victoire. As the weather was more like a spring 
equinox than a summer solstice, the number of ambassadors was smaller than usual, and the attendant 
crowd less, so that I had a better opportunity of viewing the royal family at leisure than I ever had before. 
</p><p>
I dined and breakfasted, indeed, with the ambassadors, and found them um versally more sociable than 
ever they were before. They begin now universally to consider and treat us as members of their body. 
</p><p>
It is forbidden, I suppose, to princes and princesses 
upon these occasions to utter a sentiment, lest they 
should betray a secret of state, or say something 
which might lead a sagacious ambassador to political 
consequences. Accordingly no one word is ever said, 
except asking a question about some common thing, 
as the weather, the " spectacles," or, have you 
come from Paris to-day ? I know an ambassador 
who has been fourteen years at a court, who has 
attended regularly once a week, who says that a 
prince has never failed to ask him the same question 
every time "Did you come from home to-day ?" 
and never any other. This ambassador, too, is of the 
highest rank. Among all the officers who come in 
play upon these occasions, such as introducers of ambassadors, secretary of the presentations of ambassadors, &c., there ought, I think, to be one preceptor to 
teach the princes and princesses the art of asking 
questions and making observations upon these occasions. 
</p><p>
The Prince of Orange's court is a miniature of that of 
Versailles. The ceremonials and the conversation of 
princes and princesses is much the same. The English gentlemen here, particularly Mr. Hartley, tells 
me I must be presented at court, if I should go to 
<a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> only for a visit, in my public character as a 
minister at the peace. This is rather a discouraging 
circumstance, as I should wish to go incog, as much 
as possible, and my appearance at court would make 
more talk than I wish. I should be stared at as a 
sight. I should be treated, however, complaisantly 
enough, I doubt not. The case is altered. I had 
rather make my court to my princesses at Penn's hill 
than to all the others in the world. This honor I 
hope for, but cannot promise myself so soon as I 
wish.

</p><p>
MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THIS morning, for the first time, was delivered me the 
resolution of Congress of the first of May, that a com 
mission and instructions should be made out to me, Dr. 
Franklin, and <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>, to make a treaty of commerce 
with Great Britain. If this intelligence had been sent us 
by Barney, who sailed from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> a month after 
the first of May, and has now been sailed from hence 
on his return home above a month, it would have 
saved me and others much anxiety. I am even now 
at a loss. It is of great importance that such a treaty 
should be well made. The loan in Holland must be 
attended to, and when the present one is full, another 
must be opened, which cannot be done but by me or 
my successor. There are other things, too, to be 
done in Europe of great importance. Mr. Laurens 
has leave to go home, and Mr. Dana is gone, so that 
there remain in service only <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Franklin</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>, 
and myself. In these circumstances I must stay 
another winter. I cannot justify going home. But 
what shall I do for want of my family ? By what I 
hear, I think Congress will give us all leave to come 
home in the spring. Will you come to me this fall 
and go home with me in the spring. If you will, 
come with my dear Abby, leaving the two boys at 
Mr. Shaw's, and the house and place under the care 
of your father, Uncle Quincy, or Dr. Tufts, or Mr. Cranch. This letter may reach you by the middle of 
October, and in November you may embark, and a 
passage in November or all December will be a good 
season. You may embark for <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, <a href='/results.php?city=amsterdam' rel='city'>Amsterdam</a>, 
or any port in France. On your arrival, you will 
find friends enough. The moment I hear of it, I 
will fly with post horses to receive you, at least ; and 
if the balloon should be carried to such perfection in 
the mean time as to give mankind the safe navigation 
of the air, I will fly in one of them at the rate of 
thirty knots an hour. This is my sincere wish. Al 
though the expense will be considerable, the trouble 
to you great, and you will probably have to return 
with me in the spring, I am so unhappy without you 
that I wish you would come at all events. You must 
bring with you at least one maid and one man servant. 
</p><p>
I must, however, leave it with your judgment. 
You know better than I the real intentions at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and can determine better than I whether it will 
be more prudent to wait until the spring. I am determined to be with you in America, or have you 
with me in Europe, as soon as it can be accomplished, 
consistent with private prudence and the public good. 
I am told that Congress intend to recall us all as soon 
as a few affairs are finished. If this should be the 
case, all will be well ; I shall go home with infinite 
pleasure. But it may be longer than you think of 
before all their necessary affairs will be despatched. 
The treaty of commerce with Great Britain must take 
time. A treaty will be wanted with Portugal and 
Denmark, if not with the Emperor and Empress. 
If you come to Europe this fall, in my opinion you 
will be glad to go home in the spring. If you come 
in the spring, you will wish to return the next fall. 
I am sure I shall. But six months of your company 
is worth to me all the expenses and trouble of the 
voyage. 
</p><p>
This resolution of Congress deserves my gratitude. 
It is highly honorable to me, and restores me my feelings, which a former proceeding had taken away. I 
am now perfectly content to be recalled whenever 
they think fit, or to stay in Europe until this business 
is finished, provided you will come and live with me. 
We may spend our time together in Paris, <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, or 
the <a href='/results.php?city=hague' rel='city'>Hague</a> for six or twelve months, as the public 
business may call me, and then return to our cottage 
with contented minds. It would be more agreeable 
to my inclinations to get home, and endeavor to get 
myself and my children into a settled way, but I 
think it is more necessary for the public that I should 
stay in Europe until this piece of business is finished. 
You don t probably know the circumstances which 
attend this proceeding of Congress. They are so 
honorable to me that I cannot in gratitude or decency 
refuse. 
</p><p>
I must submit your voyage to your discretion and 
advice of your friends. My most earnest wishes are 
to see you ; but if the uncertainties are such as to 
discourage you, I know it will be upon reasonable 
considerations, and must submit. But if you postpone 
the voyage for this fall, I shall insist on your coming 
in the spring, unless there is a certainty of my going 
home to you. Congress are at such grievous expense that I shall have no other secretary than my 
son. He, however, is a very good one. He writes 
a good hand very fast, and is steady to his pen 
and his books. Write me by every ship to Spain, 
France, Holland or England, that I may know. You 
give me more public intelligence than any body. 
The only hint in Europe of this commission was from 
you to

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
WE have received from Congress a resolution by 
which we are to be empowered to negotiate a treaty of 
commerce with Great Britain, myself, <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Franklin</a> 
and <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>. This will detain me in Europe this 
winter. If this letter arrive in season that you can 
come to me this fall with Miss Abby, I shall be supremely happy to see you. But still things are so 
unsettled in Congress that you may expect to return 
with me in the spring. You may come to <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, 
<a href='/results.php?city=amsterdam' rel='city'>Amsterdam</a>, or L Orient, to either of which places I 
will soon go to receive you after hearing of your arrival. 
</p><p>
It is, however, attended with so many inconveniences that I must submit it to your discretion, with 
the advice of your friends, whether to come this fall, 
or stay till spring and then come, in case things 
should not be so altered as to oblige me to come home 
then to you. I have written more fully by Mr. Thaxter, who sails the 20th of this month from L Orient, 
in the French packet to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. If you come, 
leave the boys at their school. Bring a maid and a 
man servant. Leave the place in the care of Dr. 
Tufts or your father. John is well.

Yours unfailingly,

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE this day, by special permission from their majesties, obtained by Mr. West, the painter, who with 
Mr. Copley does so much honor to our country, seen 
the apartments in the Queen's house, as it is called, 
or Buckingham House. It is a great curiosity indeed. 
There is an inestimable collection of paintings by the 
greatest masters, Raphael, Rubens, Vandyke and 
many others. There is one room which the King 
calls Mr. West's, as it is ornamented with a collection 
of his works the return of Regulus the death of Epaminondas the death of Bayard the death of 
General Wolf, &c. 
</p><p>
The cartons of Raphael are a wonderful production of art. The library is the most elegant thing I 
ever saw. But the King's military and naval room 
pleased me best, as it is a collection of plans and 
models of every dockyard and man of war in his 
empire. Come to Europe with Abby as soon as possible, and satisfy your curiosity, and improve your taste 
by viewing these magnificent scenes. Go to the 
play. See the paintings and buildings. Visit the 
manufactures for a few months ; and then, if Congress 
pleases, return to America with me to reflect upon them. I am in earnest. I cannot be happy nor tolerable without you. Besides, I really think one trip 
across the sea would be of service to you and my 
daughter, to whom my love. I shall expect you constantly until you arrive. 
</p><p>
I mourn the loss of my father, but it was time to 
expect it from his age. You must be melancholy and afflicted, and I hope that the voyage will divert your 
thoughts. Mr. Thaxter is in America before this, no 
doubt. My dear son is the only secretary I have or 
propose to have at present. I believe I shall go to 
the <a href='/results.php?city=hague' rel='city'>Hague</a> and reside chiefly there ; but write to me, 
until you embark, by Portugal, Spain, France, England or Holland. The nearer you arrive to the 
<a href='/results.php?city=hague' rel='city'>Hague</a>, the nearer I believe you will be to me, yet I 
may be in Paris. I shall stay but a short time in 
<a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>. You will read in the newspapers innumerable lies about Jay and me. Regard them as little 
as I do. I have met with an agreeable reception 
here, as agreeable as I wish ; in short I have been received here exactly as I wished to be.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YOUR letter of the 23d Has made me the happiest 
man upon earth. I am twenty years younger than I 
was yesterday. It is a cruel mortification to me that 
I cannot go to meet you in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, but there are a 
variety of reasons decisive against it, which I wilt 
communicate to you here. Meantime I send you a 
son who is the greatest traveller of his age, and with 
out partiality, I think, as promising and manly a 
youth as is in the whole world. He will purchase a 
coach, in which we four must travel to Paris. Let it 
be large and strong, with an imperial and accommodations for travelling. I wish you to see the <a href='/results.php?city=hague' rel='city'>Hague</a> 
before you go to France. The season is beautiful 
both here and in England. The journey here will be 
pleasant, excepting an hour or two of sea-sickness between Harwich and Helvoetsluys. You may come 
conveniently with your two children and your maid 
in the coach, and your man may ride on horseback 
or in the stage coach. 
</p><p>
I can give you no counsel about clothes. Mr. Puller will furnish the money you want upon your order 
or receipt. Expenses I know, will be high, but they 
must be borne, and as to clothes for yourself and 
daughter, I beg you to do what is proper, let the expense be what it may. Every hour to me will be a 
day, but don t you hurry or fatigue or disquiet your 
self upon the journey. Be careful of your health. 
After spending a week or two here, you will have to 
set out with me to France, but there are no seas between, a good road, a fine season, and we will make 
moderate journeys, and see the curiosities of several 
cities in our way ; Utrecht, Breda, Antwerp, Brussels, 
&c. &c. It is trie first time in Europe that I looked 
forward to a journey with pleasure. Now, I promise 
myself a great deal. I think it lucky that I am to 
go to Paris, where you will have an opportunity to 
see that city ; to acquire its language, &c. It will be 
more agreeable to you to be there than here, perhaps, 
for some time. For my own part, I think myself 
made for this world.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THIS moment, returning from Mr. Bridgen's, where 
I had been to deliver him a letter to you, written 
this morning, I found your very acceptable favor 
of the 23d. I am very glad you are so well situated, so much pleased with your journey and present accommodations. Don t be solicitous about me. 
I shall do very well. If I am cold in the night, and 
an additional quantity of bed clothes will not answer 
the purpose of warming me, I will take a virgin to 
bed with me. Ay ! a virgin. 
</p><p>
What ? Oh ! Awful ! what do I read ? 
</p><p>
Don t be surprised. Do you know what a virgin 
is ? Mr. Bridgen brought me acquainted with it this 
morning. It is a stone bottle, such as you buy with 
spruce beer and spa water, filled with boiling water, 
covered over or wrapped up in flannel, and laid at a 
man's feet in bed. An old man, you see, may com 
fort himself with such a virgin as much as David did 
with Abishag, and not give the least jealousy even to 
his wife, the smallest grief to his children, or any 
scandal to the world. Tell Mr. Bridgen, when you 
see him, that I am indebted to him for this important 
piece of knowledge, which I would not sell for a 
great deal of money. 
</p><p>
Tell Colonel Smith I am half disposed to be almost 
miffed with him, for going off without giving me his 
letter about the Indians ; and what completes the mis 
chief is, that he has all the books locked up in his 
room. Pray him to write me if it is possible to get 
at the letter or the books ; both are what I want. My 
love to Abby Smith and her knight, and to all the 
party. Mr. Shippen is with you ere now. He was so good as to pick a bone with me once, and Mr. Cutting is very good. We now talk politics all alone, 
and are much cooler and more rational than when we 
</p><p>
dispute in company.

MY DEAREST, 
</p><p>
MR. MURRAY, whom I am glad to see out again, will 
carry to Bath this memorandum, that we are all very 
well. He will arrive, for what I know, before Mr. Bridgen. The weather is very cold, but by a good 
fire and a good walk, I have not yet been obliged to 
recur to my expedient of an immaculate virgin bottle 
of hot water. I sent yesterday packets to Colonel Smith, from Paris. 
</p><p>
The news from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> is very well. The court 
has set at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a> in great pomp, guarded by three 
thousand men and a train of artillery. The General Court have passed an amnesty, with some exceptions, 
to all who will take the oath of allegiance in a certain 
time. The governor reviewed the troops and made 
them a speech. In short, government appears now 
in its majesty, supported by those in whom all majesty 
originally resides, the people. I have not seen the papers, but Colonel Trumbull gives me this account. 
Colonel Smith's toast, " Common sense to the common people," is already verified. 
</p><p>
Make your observations. Keep your journal, and 
make Abby Smith do so too, and let me see all when 
you return.

MY DEAREST FRIEND.

I HAVE passed through the ceremonial of taking leave 
of the States General, the prince and princess, &c., 
to the satisfaction of all parties, and have been feasted 
at court, and all that ; made my compliments to the 
prince on the 8th of March, his birth day, and to the 
princess at her drawing room, &c., &c., &c., and 
should have been in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> at this hour, if you 
had not laid a plot which has brought me to this 
town. <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, at the receipt of your letter, 
came post to meet me, and he cuts out so much business for me, to put the money matters of the United 
States upon a sure footing, that I certainly shall not 
be able to get into the packet at Helvoet before Saturday, and I much fear not before Wednesday, the 
nineteenth. This delay is very painful to me, and you must blame yourself for it altogether. I thought 
myself dead, and that it was well over with me 
as a public man ; but I think I shall be forced, after 
my decease, to open an additional loan. At least, 
this is <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>'s opinion and that of Mr. Van Staphorst. 
</p><p>
1 hope you will have every thing ready, that by 
the twenty-first or second of March, we may set off 
together for Falmouth from <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>. My love to Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and kiss my dear boy. Compliments 
to all friends. I am very impatient under this unforeseen delay ; but our bankers, as well as <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, think it absolutely necessary for the public. 
I must, therefore, submit ; but if, in consequence of 
it, you should meet southwesters on the coast of 
America, and have your voyage prolonged three 
weeks by it, remember it is all your own intrigue 
which has forced me to open this loan. I suppose 
you will boast of it as a great public service. 
Yours forever,

MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
I HAVE received yours of the 7th. I have written 
you on every post day. <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> is so anxious 
to obtain money here to enable him to discharge 
some of the most urgent demands upon the United 
States, and preserve their credit from bankruptcy for 
two years longer, after which he thinks the new government will have money in their treasury from taxes, 
that he has prevailed upon me to open a new loan by 
virtue of my old power. I was very much averse to 
this, but he would take no denial. I shall, therefore, 
be detained here till Monday, but if my health continues, I shall cross over in the packet of next Wednesday. I hope every thing will be ready for us to take 
post for Falmouth. 
</p><p>
The rich complain at present in Holland, that the 
poor are set over them in the regencies, and the old 
families that they are set aside by new ones. Discontent 
rankles deep in some places and among some sorts of 
men, but the common people appear to be much 
pleased. The patriots in this country were little read 
in history, less in government ; knew little of the human heart and still less of the world. They have, 
therefore, been the dupes of foreign politics and their 
own indigested systems. Changes may happen and 
disorders may break out, though at present there is 
no apparent probability of either ; but as there is no 
sense of the necessity of uniting and combining the 
great divisions of society in one system, no changes 
can happen for the better.

My love to the children, and believe me very anxious to see you.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
BEFORE this time I hope you have the happiness to 
see your daughter J out of all danger, and your son- 
in-law and your two grandchildren in perfect health. 
I have no letter from you since that you wrote at 
<a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, and I cannot find fault, because this is the 
first I have written to you. We are all very well, 
and go on very well. We are all in a flurry with 
politics. Mr. Dalton and Mr. Strong are senators, 
and Mr. Lowell will be representative for the district 
of Suffolk, as is generally supposed. Mr. Varnum, 
Mr. Partridge, Colonel Leonard, Mr. Grout? Mr. Sedgwick or Mr. Lyman, Mr. Jackson, or Mr. Dane, 
or Mr. Goodhue, Mr. Thatcher or Colonel Sewell, are named for other districts. 
</p><p>
My love to our children, and respects and regards 
wherever you please. Don t be uneasy on account 
of your family here, nor in haste to come home before 
a good opportunity presents. I don t enter into any 
political details. My mind has balanced all circumstances, and all are reducible to two articles vanity 
and comfort. I have the alternative in my own power. 
If they mortify my vanity, they give me comfort. 
They cannot deprive me of comfort without gratifying my vanity.

I am, my dearest friend, yours forever,

MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
I HAVE been so diligent on the road, and so much interrupted by company at the taverns, that this is the 
first time I have been able to get an opportunity to 
write to you. We arrived at this house last night 
(Saturday), shall rest here to-day, and go into New 
York to-morrow. At <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, the manufacturers 
presented me with a piece of broadcloth for a suit of 
clothes. At New Haven, the corporation presented 
me with the freedom of the city. At both these towns 
the gentlemen came out to meet us, and went out 
with us. At Horseneck, we were met by Major Pintard and Captain Mandeville, with a party of horse 
from the State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and there is to be much parade on Monday. Before this, I presume the 
printers in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> have inserted in their gazettes the 
debates of the House of Representatives, which are 
conducted with open galleries. This measure, by 
making the debates public, will establish the national 
government or break the confederation. I can conceive of no medium between these extremes. By the 
specimens that I have seen, they go on with great 
spirit in preparing the impost, which is a favorable 
omen.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE received yours of the 5th. If you think it 
best, leave Thomas at college, but I pray you to 
come on with Charles, as soon as possible. As to the 
place, let my brother plough and plant as he will, 
as much as he will. He may send me my half of 
the butter, cheese, &c., here. As to money to bear 
your expenses, you must, if you can, borrow of some 
friend, enough to bring you here. If you cannot 
borrow enough, you must sell horses, oxen, sheep, 
cows, any thing at any rate rather than not come on. 
If no one will take the place, leave it to the birds of 
the air and beasts of the field, but at all events break 
up that establishment and that household. As to 
Daniel, he has a wife and cannot leave her ; besides, 
he makes great wages where he is ; but if you have 
a mind to bring Daniel, you may. We can do with 
out him. 
</p><p>
I have as many difficulties here, as you can have, 
public and private ; but my life from my cradle has 
been a series of difficulties, and that series will continue to the grave. I hope Briesler will come, but if 
he cannot, we can do without him. I have taken Moustier's house, on the North River, a mile out of 
town. There is room enough and accommodations 
of all sorts, but no furniture. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., tenderly,

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
IN your letter of December 23d, you say, " Faxon wants 
money to buy three cows and four young cattle." I 
know not the price of stock, but if you can purchase 
him what he wants, at a reasonable rate, and can find 
means to pay for them, I shall be content ; but I 
would employ some one to purchase them in Bridge- 
water or Abington. Faxon himself is not so judicious as he ought to be in some things. 
</p><p>
I have the same aversion to the multiplication of 
banks, and the same apprehension of their pernicious 
tendency, as you express. But so many people 
live upon them that they will have their course. We 
shall soon be perplexed and distressed in consequence of them. I consider myself already as taxed one 
half of my salary and one half of all the interest of 
my money to support bankers and bankrupts. In 
short, debtors and men of no property will find means 
in our state of society to compel others who have 
something, not only to pay their debts for them, but 
to support them. It falls hardest on widows, orphans, salary men, and those who have money at 
interest, except such of these last as are at liberty 
to speculate. They are able to make what money 
they please. 
</p><p>
I received yesterday the votes from Kentucky. 
They are said to be all for <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>. Let us, 
my dear, prepare our minds, and as well as we can, 
our circumstances, to get out of this miserable 
scramble. 
</p><p>
It gives me pleasure to read that you are making 
preparations of timber for a corn-house, and I hope 
Shaw will be as attentive as he can through the whole 
winter to all my manufactures of manure, that we 
may make a good cornfield in the summer. 
</p><p>
I had yesterday a charming letter from Charles. 
According to him, had the electors of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
been chosen by the people, their votes would have 
been very different. The representation of the people in their present legislature is very unequal and 
partial in favor of the Antis and Clinton, as he has 
explained very intelligibly. Mr. Taylor, the new 
senator from Virginia, has made a motion for opening our doors and building a gallery ; but he will not 
be assisted in his argument by the late example of 
Virginia, where the electors at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> opened 
their doors and held debates and made philippics be 
fore " the Marseillois," by which means six votes are 
said to have been converted either by reasoning or by 
fear. This example will not convince the majority 
of the senators of the necessity, expediency or propriety of opening their doors. 
</p><p>
I have a warm chamber with a southern exposure, 
and have a fire in it day and night. I am warm 
enough o nights, but cannot sleep as I ought. I have 
scarcely had a complete night's sleep since I left 
you, which keeps me apprehensive of the fever and 
ague in the spring. I hope, however, to escape it. I 
shall not be able to leave this place until the fifth or 
sixth of March. The roads will be bad and the journey by the stage fatiguing, but I, who was born to be 
a slave must fulfil the end of my creation. 
Tenderly,

MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
THIS day I received yours of the 2d. I have received all the votes from all the States. It is known 
that Georgia voted with North Carolina, Virginia and 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ; and Kentucky voted for Jefferson. There 
is no other newspaper circulated in the back country of 
the southern States than Freneau's National Gazette, 
which is employed with great industry to poison the 
minds of the people. The federal court has again 
had a sitting in Virginia, and by reason of <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>'s 
sickness, the great cause is again continued, which 
serves to keep up the rage in that State and North 
Carolina, which is its echo. 
</p><p>
If you hire the man you mention, you should 
know before hand what kind of skill and experience 
he has in farming, as well as his integrity and good 
disposition. I shall leave it, however, to you. Twenty-six pounds are too high. Twenty-four are enougrf ; 
but if you cannot get one for less, we must give 
twenty -six. 
</p><p>
I expect, ere long, to hear that Paine is split and 
sliced for an aristocrat; perhaps roasted, or broiled, 
or fried. He is too lean to make a good pie, but he 
is now in company with a number who are admirably 
qualified and disposed to feed upon each other. The 
foolish vote of the constituting assembly in favor of 
a rotation and excluding themselves from being re- 
elected has cost every man of weight and talents 
among them his life, or his country and his fortune. 
All are murdered, banished and confiscated. Danton, 
Robespierre, Marat, &c., are furies. Dragon's teeth 
have been sown in France and come up monsters. 
The army has behaved better, and the people seem to 
be zealous ; but if they have not some system by 
which they can be united, what is to be expected ? 
We have our Robespierres and Marats, whose wills 
are good to do mischief, but the flesh is weak. They 
cannot yet persuade the people to follow them. If 
the National Assembly can subdue the mutinous rabble at Paris as well as Dumourier has driven the 
Prussians, they may be free, and do something, but 
what, I know not.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
OUR good friend, <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague met friend'>General Lincoln</a>, gave me this 
morning your favor of the 7th, which compensated in 
part for my disappointment by Monday's post. I set 
my heart on one letter a week, and as many more as 
you please. 
</p><p>
I cannot say that my desire of fame increases. It 
has been strong in some parts of my life, but never 
so strong as my love of honesty. I never in my life, 
that I know of, sacrificed my principles or duty to 
popularity or reputation. I hope I am now too old 
ever to do it. But one knows not how trials may be 
borne till they are made. The hell-hounds are now 
in full cry in the newspapers against the President, 
whom they treat as ill as ever they did me. The 
same insolent and impudent Irishman who is said to 
have written so much against me, is now suspected 
to be writing against him. 
</p><p>
Both houses of Congress are making strict inquisition into the treasury, with upright and patriotic 
views, no doubt. Hamilton will find ho more mercy 
than is due from a generous nation to a faithful servant. But I presume his character will shine the 
brighter. However, it is still but an experiment 
whether the ministers of state under an elective executive, will not be overborne by an elective legislature. I believe it to be certain that two elective 
houses of legislation, or even one, have it in their 
power whenever they shall have it in their will, to 
render any minister of state, or even any elective executive, unpopular, though he may be possessed of 
the best talents and most perfect integrity. I presume 
that neither of our houses will be disposed to such 
injustice, but the time may come. 
</p><p>
I am so well satisfied with my present simplicity, 
that I am determined never to depart from it again, 
so far as I have. My expenses in future, forever, 
shall at all events be within my income, nay, within 
my salary. I will no longer be the miserable dupe 
of vanity. My style of life is quite popular. What 
say you to living with me in lodgings next winter ? 
This shall be my plan, if I cannot hire a house for 
six months only. Your friends, who are very numerous, inquire tenderly after your health. Benson 
says he is for making <a href='/results.php?tla=aba' rel='spouse met friend'>Mrs. Adams</a> Autocratrix of the 
United States. This, however, must be secret, be 
cause it is a sort of treason.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE this minute received your favor of the 22d. 
The report of the President's resignation is probably 
designed to prevent the rise of the stocks ; but the 
insolence which appears every day in Bache's and Freneau's papers, proceeding from the same persons 
who are tired of abusing me, may be carried to a 
point that he will not bear. He has not been used to 
such threshing, and his skin is thinner than mine. 
</p><p>
Citizen H. and Citizen A. I presume will grace 
the civic feast. Cit and Citess is to come instead of 
Gaffer and- Gammer, Goody and Gooden, Mr. and Mrs., I suppose. 
</p><p>
Congress, I presume, will not sit after the second 
of March. I shall not be able to set off till the 5th, 
but I will not wait, if I travel but ten miles a day. 
We shall see, in a few months, the new French constitution, which may last twelve months, but probably not more than six. Robespierre and Marat, with 
their Jacobin supporters, I suspect, will overthrow the 
fabric which Condorcet, Paine and Brissot will erect. 
Then we shall see what they, in their turn, will erect. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Washington requests me to present to you her 
very particular regards. Many other ladies do the 
same. Citizen Briesler and Citizen V. P. are very 
happy together. Since they are equal and on a level, 
it is proper that sometimes, one should be named first, 
and sometimes, the other. Our countrymen are 
about to abandon the good old, grave, solid manners 
of Englishmen, their ancestors, and adopt all the 
apery, levity, and frivolity, of the French.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I RECEIVED yesterday your kind favor of the 1st of 
this month, and thank you for its agreeable contents. 
I have now to congratulate you on the arrival of your 
son and daughter and two grandsons, in fine health, at 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. They have done wisely to fly from the evil 
to come in Europe ; although it is somewhat dubious 
whether our fellow citizens will have the wisdom to 
abstain from similar evils in this country. My friend 
Malesherbes is about to crown the end of his life with 
greater glory than he gained in his youth or middle 
age, though this was splendid. Such a character as 
that great magistrate ought to wish to die on so great 
a theatre in defence of his prince, and struggling 
against the disgrace which enthusiasm is about to 
bring upon the nation. 
</p><p>
The spirit of ambition and of conquest, which the 
French republic in its cradle has already discovered, 
has alarmed England and Holland. France has been 
execrated in Europe for their ambition for universal 
monarchy ; but the passion was imputed to their kings, 
Henry 4th and Louis 14th. But the people are already 
giving unequivocal proofs of an equal lust after a 
universal republic. The passion is, and always has 
been, in the people, the nation, and their leaders will 
ever be infected with it, whether they call them 
kings, or presidents, or citizens. I can only sigh at 
the prospect of calamities opening on the human race 
and pray God to avert them. 
</p><p>
We have to-day a deep snow, which I hope will 
last till I can reach <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a> in a sleigh and there enjoy a felicity, which will never be allowed me any 
where else.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I AM so anxious for your health since you informed 
me of the return of your intermittent, that I shall 
take the stage on Monday for <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, but whether 
I shall go by the packet to <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, or continue in

at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
Colonel Smith is here in good health. He is re 
turned from France and England almost a revolutionist, 
if not quite. The fermentation in Europe distresses 
me, lest it should take a turn which may involve us 
in many difficulties. Our neutrality will be a very 
delicate thing to maintain, and I am not without ap 
prehension that Congress, at least the Senate, may be 
called together in the summer, if not earlier. How 
ever, we must be prepared as well as we can for 
events. 
</p><p>
The Attorney General, in opening the information 
to the jury, at the trial of Mr. Paine, was pleased to 
quote large passages from Publicola, with some handsome compliments, so that Publicola is become a law authority. Mr. Erskine in his answer, cried, 
" Well, let others do like Publicola, answer the book, 
not prosecute the author." 
</p><p>
I am weary of reading newspapers. The times 
are so full of events, the whole drama of the world 
is such a tragedy that I am weary of the spectacle. 
O ! my sweet little farm, what would I not give to en 
joy thee without interruption ! But I see no end to 
my servitude, however the nations of Europe, and 
even of Africa, may recover their liberty. 
</p><p>
Hamilton has been sufficiently fatigued with demands for statements and information. I hope his 
health will hold out and his character be supported. 
But we have broad hints of what may be expected 
by executive officers who depend upon an elective 
head, from elective legislatures. Ambitious members of a legislature will too easily run down the popularity of ministers of state, or I am egregiously mis 
taken. But ga ira. France will soon show us examples enough of ministers falling before ambitious 
legislatures, if she has not exhibited enough already. Galon ne, Necker, Montmorin, and twenty others, 
where are they ?

YOUR letter from your sick chamber, if not from your 
sick bed, has made me so uneasy, that I must get 
away as soon as possible. Monday morning, at six, I 
am to set off in the stage, but how many days it will 
take to get home will depend on the roads or the 
winds. I don t believe Abby will go with me. Her 
husband is so proud of his wealth that he would not 
let her go&gt; I suppose, without a coach-and-four, and 
such monarchical trumpery I will in future have no 
thing to do with. I will never travel but by the stage, 
nor live at the seat of government but at lodgings, 
while they give me so despicable an allowance. 
Shiver my jib and start my planks if I do. 
</p><p>
I will stay but one night at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. Smith 
says that my books are upon the table of every member of the committee for framing a constitution of 
government for France, except Tom Paine, and he is 
so conceited as to disdain to have any thing to do 
with books. Although I abused Smith a little above, 
he is very clever and agreeable : but I have been 
obliged to caution him against his disposition to boast 
ing. Tell not of your prosperity, because it will 
make two men mad to one glad ; nor of your adversity, for it will make two men glad to one sad. He 
boasts too much of having made his fortune, and 
placed himself at his ease, above all favors of government. This is a weakness, and betrays too little knowledge of the world ; too little penetration ; too little discretion. I wish, however, that my boys had a little 
more of his activity. I must soon treat them as the 
pigeons treat their squabs push them off the limb, 
and make them put out their wings or fall. Young 
pigeons will never fly till this is done. Smith has acquired the confidence of the French ministry and the 
better sort of the members of the national convention ; but the executive is too changeable in that 
country to be depended on, without the utmost caution.

MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
I WROTE you from <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and once 
from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> ; but have not yet had the pleasure 
of a letter from you since I left home. The night 
before last we had a deep snow, which will probably 
extinguish all remaining apprehensions of infection, 
We hear of no sickness, and all seem at their ease, 
and without fear. 
</p><p>
The President's speech will show you an abundance of serious business which we have before us. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> called on me last night, and informed 
me that to-day we should have the whole budget of 
foreign affairs, British as well as French. He seems 
as little satisfied with the conduct of the French minister, as any one. Thomas spent the last evening 
with me. He has had an opportunity of seeing the 
courts, judges, lawyers, &c., of New Jersey, in the 
course of the last fall, and has, I hope, employed his 
time to advantage. This day, he is to be examined, 
and this week, sworn in. May a blessing attend him. 
Although I have attended and shall attend my duty 
punctually in senate, I shall not run about upon visits, 
without caution. Yet I believe there is little or no 
danger. 
</p><p>
The Viscount Noailles called on me, and I enquired after all his connexions in a family, which I 
knew to be once in great power, wealth and splendor. 
He seems to despair of liberty in France, and has 
lost apparently all hopes of ever living in France. 
He was very critical in his enquiries concerning the 
letters which were printed as mine in England. I 
told him candidly that I did not write them, and as 
frankly in confidence, who did. He says they made 
a great impression upon the people of England. That 
he heard Mr. Wind ham and Mr. Fox speak of them, 
as the best thing that had been written, and as one of 
the best pieces both of reasoning and style they had ever read. The marquis, he says, is living, but injured in his health. Your old friend, the marchioness, 
still lives in France, in obscurity in the country. He 
thinks that a Constitution like that of England, would 
not last three days in France, and that monarchy will 
not be restored in a dozen years, if ever. The partitioning and arbitrary spirit of the combined powers, 
will contribute more than any thing towards uniting 
the French under their old government. Frenchmen 
cannot bear the partition of their country ; and rather 
than see it divided among their neighbors, they will 
unite in something or other. 
</p><p>
It will require all the address, all the temper, and 
all the firmness of Congress and the States to keep 
this people out of the war; or rather, to avoid a 
declaration of war against us, from some mischievous 
power or other. It is but little that I can do, either 
by the functions which the constitution has intrusted 
to me, or by my personal influence ; but that little 
shall be industriously employed, until it is put beyond 
a doubt that it will be fruitless, and then, I shall be as 
ready to meet unavoidable calamities as any other 
citizen.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
MRS. OTIS arrived, with her little rossignol, in good 
health and spirits, the night before last, and brought 
me your favor of 7th December. Why am I not so 
fortunate as to be able to receive my best friend and 
to spend my days with her, whose society is the principal delight of my life ? If I could make twelve 
thousand dollars at a bargain, and several of such 
bargains in a year : but silence. So it is ordained, 
and we must not complain. 
</p><p>
If a suitable season should occur for ploughing, 
our men may plough ; if not, they may leave it till 
spring, I like your plan very well to stock one place 
with young cattle, and to apply to Shaw, if Humphreys and Porter decline to take care of the dairy 
in the other. I am pleased with Dr. Tufts's plan. 
</p><p>
Citizen Genet made me a visit yesterday while I 
was in Senate, and left his card. I shall leave mine 
at his hotel tomorrow, as several of the senators have 
already hastened to return their visits. But we shall 
be in an awkward situation with this minister. I write 
you little concerning public affairs, because you will 
have every thing in print. How a government can 
go on, publishing all their negotiations with foreign 
nations I know not. To me it appears as dangerous 
and pernicious as it is novel ; but, upon this occasion 
it could not, perhaps, have been avoided. You know 
where, I think, was the error in the first concoction. 
But such errors are unavoidable when the people in 
crowds out of doors undertake to receive ambassadors, and to dictate to their supreme executive. 
</p><p>
I know not how it is, but in proportion as danger 
threatens I grow calm. I am very apprehensive that 
a desperate anti-federal party will provoke all Europe 
by their insolence. But my country has, in its wisdom, contrived for me the most insignificant office 
that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived : and as I can do neither good nor 
evil, I must be borne away by others and meet the 
common fate. 
</p><p>
The President has considered the conduct of Genet 
very nearly in the same light with <a href='/results.php?city=columbus' rel='city'>Columbus</a>, and has 
given him a bolt of thunder. We shall see how this 
is supported by the two houses. There are who 
gnash their teeth with rage which they dare not 
own as yet. We shall soon see whether we have any 
government or not in this country. If the President 
has made any mistake at all, it is by too much partiality for the French republicans and in not preserving a neutrality between the parties in France as well 
as among the belligerent powers ; but although he 
stands at present as high in the admiration and confidence of the people as ever he did, I expect he will 
find many bitter and desperate enemies arise in con 
sequence of his just judgment against Genet. Be 
sides that a party spirit will convert white into black 
, and right into wrong, we have, I fear, very corrupt 
individuals in this country, independent of the common spirit of party. The common movements of 
ambition every day disclose to me views and hopes 
and designs that are very diverting, but these I will 
not commit to paper. They make sometimes a very 
pretty farce for amusement after the great tragedy or 
comedy is over. What I write to you must be in sacred confidence and strict discretion. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Washington prays me every time I see her to 
remember her to you very affectionately. 
I am, as ever, your

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
OUR anti-federal scribblers are so fond of rotations 
that they seem disposed to remove their abuse from 
me to the President. Bache's paper, which is 
nearly as bad as Freneau's, begins to join in concert with it to maul the President for his drawing 
rooms, levees, declining to accept of invitations to 
dinners and tea parties, his birth day odes, visits, 
compliments, &c. I may be expected to be an advocate for a rotation of objects of abuse and for equality 
in this particular. I have held the office of Libellee General long enough. The burden of it ought to be 
participated and equalized according to modern re 
publican principles. 
</p><p>
The news from France, so glorious for the French 
army, is celebrated in loud peals of festivity, and 
elevates the spirits of the enemies of government 
among us more than it ought, for it will not answer 
their ends. We shall now see the form of the 
French republic. Their conventions will have many 
trials to make before they will come at any thing permanent. The calamities of France are not over. 
I shall claim the merit of some little accuracy of 
foresight when I see <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague met friend'>General Lincoln</a>, who, you re 
member, was inclined to think the Duke of Bruns 
wick's march to Paris certain, while I Was apprehensive that the numerous fortified towns in his way 
would waste his army and consume the campaign. 
</p><p>
We shall soon see the operation in France of elections to first magistracies. My attention is fixed to 
this object. I have no doubt of its effects ; but it is 
a curious question how long they can last. We have 
lately seen how they have succeeded in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
and what effect that election has had upon the votes 
for President. Cabal, intrigue, manoeuvre, as bad as 
any species of corruption, we have already seen in 
our elections, and when and where will they stop ? 
Tenderly,

MY DEAREST FRIE1YD, 
</p><p>
THE anxiety you express in your kind letter of 31st 
December, which I received this morning, for your 
country and the happiness of your children, is very 
amiable. The prospects of this country are gloomy, 
but the situation of all Europe is calamitous beyond 
all former examples. At what time, and in what 
manner, and by what means, the disasters which are 
come, and seem to be coming on mankind, may be 
averted, I know not. Our own people have been imprudent, as I think, and are now smarting under the 
effects of their indiscretion ; but this, instead of a 
consolation, is an aggravation of our misfortune. Mr. Genet has been abusive on the President and all his 
ministers, beyond all measure of decency or obligations of truth, and in other respects not yet publicly 
investigated, his conduct has been such as to make it 
difficult to know what to do with him. But I cannot 
explain myself fully. You must wait for time to bring 
forth events and eclair cissements. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Washington always inquires affectionately 
after your health, and I never forget to present your 
respects. 
</p><p>
The news of this evening is, that the Queen of 
France is no more. When will savages be satiated 
with blood ? No prospect of peace in Europe, and 
therefore none of internal harmony in America. We 
cannot well be in a more disagreeable situation than 
we are with all Europe, with all Indians, and with all 
Barbary rovers. Nearly one half the continent is in 
constant opposition to the other, and the President's 
situation, which is highly responsible, is very distress 
ing. He made me a very friendly visit yesterday, 
which I returned to-day, and had two hours conversation with him alone in his cabinet. The conversation, 
which was extremely interesting, and equally affectionate, I cannot explain even by a hint. But his earnest 
desire to do right and his close application to discover 
it, his deliberate and comprehensive view of our affairs 
with all the world, appeared in a very amiable and 
respectable light. The anti-federalists and the frenchified zealots have nothing now to do that I can conceive of, bat to ruin his character, destroy his peace, 
and injure his health. He supports all their attacks 
with great firmness, and his health appears to be very 
good. The Jacobins would make a sortie upon him 
in all the force they could muster, if they dared. 
I run on and say nothing, so I will conclude. 
Your ever affectionate 
</p><p>

MY DEAREST FRIEND,

KNOWING your taste for political speculations, I send 
you a couple of pamphlets for your amusement. 
The American production is said to have been writ 
ten by a senator from Virginia, Mr. Taylor ; I know 
not how truly. It is like his style, spirit, opinions, 
and sentiments. 
</p><p>
There is too much foundation for some of his observations ; but, although he has told some truth he 
has not told the whole truth, and he has told some 
thing that is not truth. One Bank of the United 
States, with its branches strictly limited in its operations, would be useful, but the State legislatures have 
multiplied banks to such a degree that one knows 
not how far the evil has already gone, nor where it 
will stop.

MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
I AM weary of this scene of dulness. We have done 
nothing and shall do nothing this session, which ought 
to be done, unless we should appropriate a sufficient 
sum of money for treating with the Algerines. We 
are afraid to go to war, though our inclinations and 
dispositions are strong enough to join the French re 
publicans. It is happy that our fears are a check to 
our resentments ; and our understandings are better 
than our hearts. 
</p><p>
One day spent at home would afford me more in 
ward delight and comfort than a week or a winter in 
this place. We have frequent rumors and alarms 
about the yellow fever, but when they come to be 
traced to their sources, they have hitherto proved to 
be false. There is one at present in circulation which 
is not quite cleared up, and the weather is extremely 
warm, muggy, foggy, and unfavorable for the season. 
The river is open and, some say, is never frozen over 
after this time. Others say there have been instances 
in the last week in January. 
</p><p>
Thomas visits me of evenings, and we converse 
concerning Hambden and Falkland, Charles and Oli 
ver, Essex and Rupert, of whose characters and con 
duct he reads every day in Lord Clarendon. I fear 
he makes too many visits in families where there are 
young ladies. Time is spent and nothing learned. 
Pardon me ! Disciple of Wolstoncraft ! I never relished conversations with ladies, excepting with one at 
a time, and alone rather than in company. I liked 
not to lose my time. I begin now to think all time 
lost that is not employed in farming ; innocent, heal 
thy, gay, elegant amusement ! Enchanting employ-ment ! how my imagination roves over my rocky 
mountains, and through my brushy meadows.

So ! the tables are turned on the French faction ! and 
the English faction will exult, in their turn, in the 
prospect of the West India Islands, a conquest to 
England, the French navy wholly ruined, and insurrection spreading from province to province. Alas ! 
I see no cause of joy in all these exultations in either 
side. I am compelled to console myself as well as I 
can.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
VIVE la bagatelle ! Dulce est desipere. I have no 
other resource in my solitude amidst all my gloomy 
forebodings of the future miseries of my beloved 
species. Our allies, our only allies, as the demi crazies pathetically call them, have completed their system by turning all their churches into Je ne seals quoi, 
and if they should have any government erected 
among them either by themselves or others, they may 
substitute choruses of boys and girls to chant prayers 
like the Romans 
<block>
" Hie bellum lacrimosum, hie miseram famera 
Pestemque, a populo et principe Caesare, in 
Persas atque Britannos 
</p><p>
Vestra motus aget prece." 
</block>
Their prayers will probably be heard, and war, 
pestilence and famine may be ready to seize the 
Austrians and Britons as soon as they have satiated 
themselves with havock in France. I hope, however, 
that the awful example of that country, whether it 
shall be like to those of Tyre and Sidon, Sodom and 
Gomorrah, or whether it shall terminate less fatally, 
will be a warning to all other nations and to ours 
especially. The Britons and Spaniards, by taking the 
West India Islands, and attempting to hold them, will 
only lay foundations for future wars to restore them. 
In short, I see no end of war. It is a comfort to reflect that they can do no greater evil than put an end 
to their lives. 
</p><p>
What think the clergy of New England ? What 
says Mr. Wibird? Do they still admire the French 
republicans ? Do they think them virtuous ? Do 
they wish to see them imitated by all nations ? Do 
they wish to resign all their salaries, and to have 
their churches all turned into riding houses, the 
Sabbath abolished, and one day in ten substituted 
to sing songs to the manes of Marat ? O, my soul, 
come not thou into the secrets of such republicans! 
The guillotine itself would not make me a sincere re 
publican upon such conditions. 
</p><p>
The spirit, principles and system of rational liberty 
to all nations, is my toast ; but I see no tendency to 
any thing but anarchy, licentiousness and despotism. 
Mankind will not learn wisdom from experience.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE birth day was celebrated yesterday with as much 
joy, affection and festivity as ever, and as it happened, 
the new French minister was then presented. Poor 
Genet, I fear, is undone. Bad as his conduct has 
been, I cannot but pity him. What will become of 
him, I know not. The name of his successor is Fauchet. Gloomy as I was in expectation daily of afflicting news from home, I contented myself with 
paying my respects to the President with the Senate, 
but I thought it would not become me to be present 
at the ball of a Saturday night, especially at a time 
when I could not get it out of my thoughts that my 
venerable parent might be closing her eyes forever. 
</p><p>
The Senate has been several days trying a con 
tested election of Mr. Gallatin with their doors open. 
It is at length determined that a gallery is to be built, 
and our debates public at the next session of Congress. What the effect of this measure, which was 
at last carried by a great majority, will be, I know 
not ; but it cannot produce greater evils than the con 
test about it, which was made an engine to render 
unpopular some of the ablest and most independent 
members. Some of the younger members may descend from their dignity so far, perhaps, as to court 
popularity at the expense of justice, truth and wisdom, by flattering the prejudices of the audience, 
but I think they will lose more esteem than they will 
acquire by such means. 
</p><p>
If my mother still lives, present her my duty and 
tender sympathy under her affliction. I am, with 
every tender sentiment,

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE Senate were obliged to spend the whole of the 
last week, in a solemn trial of the election of Mr. Gallatin, and I find that a great impression has been 
made upon the public by the learning, eloquence, 
and reasoning of some of the senators. The decision has given general satisfaction. That popularity was more courted than truth by a few individuals, I fear will be the judgment of some of the most 
enlightened and independent spectators. 
</p><p>
I have again been unfortunate at sea. The vessel 
in which I shipped my grass seeds and two barrels of 
rye flour for you, has been run down and sunk in the 
river by a large ship. Most of the cargo was saved, 
but whether my adventure was saved or lost, I have 
not yet learned. The weather to-day has been very 
warm, and the snow, which generally covered the 
earth this morning, is, I presume, nearly gone. The 
spring will advance with rapid strides, and I shall 
be impatient to be at home ; but I cannot prevail 
upon myself to ask leave of absence from my post 
at this critical time, when we know not what questions or events a day may bring forth. 
</p><p>
The new French minister, M. Fauchet, is about 
thirty-three. He is not quite so unreserved as his 
predecessor, but he seems to me to be in great distress. He was received by the galleries in the theatre with three cheers, but the people have not ad 
dressed him or made much noise about him. At the 
birth-night ball he was placed by the managers on 
the right hand of the President, which gave great of 
fence to the Spanish commissioners ; and it is said 
Mr. Hammond has left the theatre, offended or dis 
gusted at some partial popular distinctions there. My 
melancholy anxiety for my mother prevents me from 
visiting theatres and assemblies, so that I know no 
thing but by hearsay. 
</p><p>
The discussions of last week kept me five or six 
hours a day in so close a confinement, and the crowd 
of hearers injured the air so, that I was almost sick ; 
but a day or two of rest has relieved me in some degree. I long for my home, but that is not to be my 
felicity for some time.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE all along flattered myself with hopes that I 
might with propriety have taken leave of the Senate 
and returned home as soon as the roads might be settled, but such is the critical state of our public affairs, 
and I daily hear such doctrines advanced and supported 
by almost and, sometimes, quite one half of the Sen 
ate, that I shall not prevail on myself to abandon my 
post. This day, the senators were equally divided 
upon a question, which seemed to me to involve no 
thing less than peace and war, and I was obliged to 
decide it, to the no small chagrin of a number. If 
this country is involved in war, it shall not be by my 
fault ; but if it comes either from the malice of our 
enemies or the imprudence of our own people, it may 
perhaps be found that I shall not shrink from its difficulties sooner than some who now seek it in disguise. 
Business is now carried on with rapidity in both 
houses, and I shall have a month of severe duty. I 
have not been absent a day. It is, to be sure, a punishment to hear other men talk five hours every day 
and not be at liberty to talk at all myself, especially 
as more than half I hear appears to me very young, 
inconsiderate, and inexperienced. 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> town meetine, as it terminated, did a 
service to the public. If government must be affronted or intimidated by popular clubs and partial 
meetings of the people, it is a pity that our cities are 
not all as capable as <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> of discussing great questions. But in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> there is 
meeting against meeting, and club against club, to 
the utter confusion of the public opinion. 
</p><p>
It is rumored that we are to lose two ministers of 
state l by resignation, but I would not have the report 
propagated from me. I suffer many melancholy 
hours on account of my dear mother, and as many 
on your account. Your trial must be severe, and I 
often wish I were with you to cheer up your spirits 
and share a part of your cares. The spring opens, 
the birds sing, the weather is fine, and all things cheerful, but my thoughts about my home and our public 
prospects.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
CHEESEMAN has at length arrived, and I have received 
my trunk in much better order than I expected. 
</p><p>
The people here are much cooler than they were 
last week. The embargo begins to be felt by many 
who have been the most noisy and turbulent. Speculation mingles itself in every political operation, and 
many merchants have already made a noble spec of 
the embargo by raising their prices ; but the foolish 
tradesmen and laborers, who were so ready to follow 
the heels of their scheming leaders, are now out of 
employment, and will lose thirty dollars a head by 
this embargo. If they had been taxed half the sum 
to the most necessary and important measure, they 
would have bitterly complained. I can see little benefit in the embargo, except that it may cool down the 
courage of such kind of people. It may be expected 
that we shall soon have a clamor against the renewal 
of it, if not to have it repealed. 
</p><p>
The Assembly of Pennsylvania have this day 
chosen a senator; Mr. James Ross, of Washington 
county, in the place of Mr. Gallatin. 
</p><p>
A violent measure has been proposed in the House, 
to sequester all debts due from American citizens to 
British subjects. Such a motion will do no honor to 
our country. Such laws are injurious to the debtor as 
well as the creditor, for they cannot dissolve the con 
tracts. It will not pass the House, and if it did, it 
would stop in the Senate. 
</p><p>
We are rejoiced that the civic feast in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> succeeded no better. It is astonishing that Mr. A. should ever have thought of implicating the government in 
so indecent and hostile a frolic. We have had an 
incessant struggle all the winter to restrain the internperate ardor of the people out of doors and their too 
accurate representatives in both houses. Too many 
of our good federalists are carried away at times by 
their passions, and the popular torrent, to concur in 
motions arid countenance sentiments inconsistent with 
our neutrality and tending directly to war. But I 
hope we shall be able to make a stand against all 
fatal attempts. 
</p><p>
I long to be at home, but I dare not ask leave to 
go. The times are too critical for any man to quit 
his post without the most urgent necessity. Ways 
and means must be provided to defray the expenses 
incurred, and I expect this will be put off till May. I 
shall be very uneasy through this whole month, but 
I must take patience. I hope <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='me'>Mr. Adams</a>, of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, 
the lawyer, is full of business and making his for 
tune. I hear so seldom from him, that I must sup 
pose him busy. 
</p><p>
Tell my dear mother that I hope to have the plea 
sure of seeing her in the month of May. Love to 
my brothers and sister and cousins, &c. 
</p><p>
I am most tenderly yours, 
</p><p>

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE post of the day brought me your kind letter of 
26th ultimo. The more I am charmed with your 
bravery and activity in farming, the more I am mortified that my letters in answer to yours are so insignificant and insipid. I must leave all your agriculture to your judgment and the advice of your assist 
ants. I sent you more grass seeds with the furniture, 
which I hope has arrived before now. 
</p><p>
The times are so critical and parties so nearly balanced that I cannot in honor, nor consistently with 
my duty, abandon my post. There are so many 
wild projects and motions, and so many to support 
them, that I am become of more importance than 
usual, in the opinion of the soundest part of the community. We have very disagreeable business to do 
in finding ways and means for the expenses we have 
already incurred. It grieves me to the heart to see 
an increase of our debts and taxes, and it vexes me 
to see men opposing even these augmentations, who 
are every day pushing for measures that must involve us in war, and ten times greater expenses. 
But the inconsistencies and absurdities of men are no 
novelties to me. 
</p><p>
I have pleased myself with a hope that I should get 
home in April, but the general opinion is, we shall 
be obliged to remain here till the middle of May. I 
have little expectation of seeing you before election. 
You are so valorous and noble a farmer that I feel 
little anxious about agriculture. Manure in hills if 
you think best, but manure your barley ground and 
harrow it well. I have now the pleasing hope of seeing my honored mother again in comfortable health. 
I have suffered many melancholy hours both on her 
account and yours, and I think myself indebted, under <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, to your tender care and indefatigable 
assiduity for the prolongation of her life. 
</p><p>
If the yellow fever should make its appearance 
here, we shall soon fly ; but there is no symptom of 
it as yet. I am sometimes obliged to give critical 
votes, which expose me to the passions of parties ; 
but I have been wonderfully spared this session. They 
find it best to let me alone, for I get credit by their 
abuse. I am, most sincerely and most kindly, 
</p><p>

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE weather is cooler, and the minds of men are 
calmed by the enclosed communication ; but a soured 
party will plunge us [in war] if possible. The most un- 
candid, the most hypocritical part is acted, to take us 
in. Protestations against war by those who are pushing every thing that can force war, are not the worst. 
The southern men have art enough to dupe northern 
ones to bring forward measures, that the northern 
part may have the odium of bringing on a war. In 
short, the knavery of some is so abominable, and the 
stupidity of others so contemptible, that I am almost 
brought to Raynal's wish. The old debtors to Britain uniting with those who are bribed to France, and 
both operating upon the populaces of our great towns, 
will devote this country to calamities as unnecessary 
as they will be dismal, unless the vigilance and patience of those who have no object but their country's 
good is supported by the sound part of the people out 
of doors. 
</p><p>
My good and worthy son, I presume, sees all I send 
you. All my hopes are in him, both for my family 
and country. 
</p><p>
Yours, most affectionately,

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YOUR favor of the 28th ultimo arrived this morning. 
Before this time I hope you have received your furniture. 
</p><p>
We are still endeavoring to preserve peace ; but 
one moves a series of commercial regulations, an 
other, a sequestration of debts, a third,to prohibit 
all intercourse with Britain, a fourth, to issue letters 
of marque against Algerines, all tending to excite 
suspicions in Britain that we are hostile to her, and 
mean ultimately to join her enemies. One firebrand 
is scarcely quenched before another is thrown in ; 
and if the sound part of the community is not uncommonly active and attentive to support us, we shall be 
drawn off from our neutral ground and involved in 
incomprehensible evils. In danger of a war that will 
be unnecessary, if not unjust, that has no public object in view, that must be carried on with allies the 
most dangerous that ever existed, my situation is as 
disagreeable as any I ever knew. I should have no 
fear of an honest war, but a knavish one would fill 
me with disgust and abhorrence. 
</p><p>
At nine o clock at night I suppose your election is 
over, and another fortnight will enable us to guess 
whether an Adams or a Gushing is to be the great 
man. Although the old gentleman's conduct is not 
such as I can approve in many things of late years, 
yet I find it difficult to believe that the people of Massachusetts will forsake him in his last moments. 
Alas ! his grandeur must be of short duration, if it 
ever commences. I shall be happier at home, if 
Gushing succeeds ; and the State, I believe, will be 
more prudently conducted. 
</p><p>
The federalists have ventured on a dangerous manoeuvre. I am afraid the delicacy which has usually 
attended elections in New England will be injured if 
not destroyed by these elections of governors and 
senators, so as to be never regained even in the choice 
of representatives. But we must fulfil our destiny. 
I am afraid I shall not see you till election. I never 
longed more to be at home. 
</p><p>
Yours, most tenderly, 
</p><p>

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE House yesterday passed a resolution in committee of the whole, whose depth is to me unfathomable. The Senate will now be called upon to show 
their independence, and perhaps your friend to show 
his weakness or his strength. The majority of the 
House is certainly for mischief, and there is no doubt 
they represent the people in the southern States and 
a large number in the northern. Vox populi, vox Dei, they say, and so it is, sometimes ; but it is some 
times the voice of Mahomet, of Caesar, of Catiline, 
the Pope and the Devil. Britain, however, has done 
much amiss, and deserves all that will fall thereon. 
Her insolence, which you and I have known and felt 
more than any other Americans, will lead her to ruin 
and us half way. We, indeed, are, in point of insolence, her very image and superscription, as true a 
game cock as she, and I warrant you, shall become 
as great a scourge to mankind. 
</p><p>
Our furniture has had its last removal. Your distress and distraction at its landing are very strongly 
described. Whatever crashes have happened shall 
be the last from removals. My countrymen are 
going into a career that I shall not long follow. I 
don t expect another election, if I should, peradventure, ride out the remainder of my term. I long 
to see you, but I fear it will be late in May if not the 
beginning of June.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
SENATE has been three days in debate upon the appointment of <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a> to go to <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>. It has this 
day been determined in his favor eighteen versus eight. 
</p><p>
You cannot imagine what horror some persons are 
in, lest peace should continue. The prospect of peace 
throws them into distress. Their countenances length 
en at the least opening of an appearance of it. 
Glancing gleams of joy beam from their faces when 
ever all possibility of it seems to be cut off. You 
can divine the secret source of these feelings as well 
as I. The opposition to <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a> has been quickened 
by motives which always influence every thing in an 
elective government. Pretexts are never wanting to 
ingenious men, but the views of all the principal 
parties are always directed to the election of the first 
magistrate. If Jay should succeed, it will recommend him to the choice of the people for President, 
as soon as a vacancy shall happen. This will weak 
en the hopes of the southern States for Jefferson. 
This I believe to be the secret motive of the opposition to him, though other things were alleged as ostensible reasons; such as, his monarchical principles, 
his indifference about the navigation of the Mississippi, his attachment to England, his aversion to France, 
none of which are well founded, and his holding the 
office of Chief Justice, &c. 
</p><p>
The day is a good omen. May the gentle zephyrs 
waft him to his destination, and the blessing of heaven succeed his virtuous endeavors to preserve peace. 
I am so well satisfied with this measure, that I shall 
run the venture to ask leave to go home, if Congress 
determines to sit beyond the middle of May. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='me'>Mr. Adams</a> is to be Governor, it seems, by a great 
majority of the people; and I am not surprised at it. 
I should have thought human nature dead in the Massachusetts if it had been otherwise. I expect now he 
will be less anti-federal. Gill is to be Lieutenant. 
We will go to <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a> again to congratulate him. 
I thought, however, that Gerry would have been the man. 
</p><p>
We are ill-treated by Britain, and you and I know 
it is owing to a national insolence against us. If they 
force us into a war, it is my firm faith, that they will 
be chastised for it a second time, worse than the first. 
I am, with an affection too tender to be expressed,

I MUST remain here, because my friends say I must 
not go. Those whose principles are the same with 
mine, whose views of public good coincide with mine, 
say that if we keep together, we shall succeed to the 
end of the session as we have hitherto done, in keeping off all the most pernicious projects. 
</p><p>
The ways and means before the House of Representatives is a very important and a very difficult system. 
While I confess the necessity of it, and see its importance in giving strength to our government at 
home and consideration to our country abroad, I lament the introduction of taxes and expenses which 
will accumulate a perpetual debt and lead to future 
revolutions.

MY DEAREST FRIEND,

WE go on as usual, Congress resolving one thing and 
the democratical societies resolving the contrary ; the 
President doing what is right, and clubs and mobs re 
solving it to be all wrong. 
</p><p>
We had in Senate, a few days ago, the greatest 
curiosity of all. The senators from Virginia moved, 
in consequence of an instruction from their constituents, that the execution of the fourth article of the 
treaty of peace, relative to bona Jide debts, should 
be suspended, until Britain should fulfil the seventh 
article. When the question was put, fourteen voted 
against it, two only, the Virginia delegates, for it, and 
all the rest, but one, ran out of the room to avoid 
voting at all, and that one excused himself. This is 
the first instance of the kind. 
</p><p>
The motion disclosed the real object of all the wild 
projects and mad motions which have been made during the whole session. O ! liberty. O ! my coun 
try. O ! debt, and O ! sin ? These debtors are the 
persons who are continually declaiming against the 
corruption of Congress. Impudence ! thy front is 
brass. 
</p><p>
The House is upon ways and means, which will 
take us the rest of the month, I fear.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE long continuance of the session, and the uncommon heat and drought of the weather, have made this 
to me an unpleasant spring, and to increase my mortification, I have this week received no letter from 
you. I have not, for several months before, failed to 
receive a delicious letter, worth a dozen of mine, 
once a week. 
</p><p>
Well ! <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> comes on. Mr. M. is now to be its 
leader. How changed in reputation since <a href='/results.php?year=1788'>1788</a> ! I 
wonder not at the choice of Well-born Winthrop. 
He might, I suppose, have been chosen at any time. 
His father was one of my best friends, and the son 
was a good son of liberty. I know of nothing to his 
disadvantage. The federalists committed an egregious blunder in a very unwarrantable and indecent 
attempt, had almost said, upon the freedom of elections, at their previous meeting for the choice of governor. The opposite party, to be sure, practise arts 
nearly as unwarrantable in secret, and by sending 
agents with printed votes. But this is no justification, 
unless upon Cato's principle : In corrupta civitate corruptio est licita ; i. e., in a corrupt city, corruption 
is lawful. Elections are going the usual way in our 
devoted country. O ! that I had done with them. 
We shall realize the raving in the Tempest, which C. 
quoted to me in his last letter : 
</p><p>
" I the Commonwealth" we shall "by contraries 
Execute all things ; for no kind of traffic 
Shall we admit ; no name of magistrate ; 
Letters will not be known ; wealth, poverty 
And use of service, none ; contract, succession, 
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none ; 
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil ; 
No occupation ; all men idle, all; 
And women too ; but innocent and pure ; 
No sovereignty : 
</p><p>
All things in common nature should produce 
Without sweat or endeavor ; treason, felony, 
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine, 
Would I not have ; but nature should bring forth 
Of its own kind, all foizon, all abundance, 
To feed my innocent people." 
</p><p>
This is lubberland, indeed, Le pays de Cocagne, 
I believe the French call it ; but it is terra incognita. 
I am afraid we shall have too many of its qualities 
without its innocence. 
</p><p>
I have no hope of Congress rising, before the last 
of May. Never in my life did I long to see you 
more.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I SHALL enclose with this some letters between Randolph and Hammond, which will show you how quarrelsome they are. Poor fellows ! They both desire 
peace, but think themselves obliged to wrangle 
for their countries. It is fashionable to charge wars 
upon kings, but I think " le peuple souverain" is as 
inflammable and as proud, and at the same time less 
systematic, uniform, and united, so that it is not easy 
for them to avoid wars. We have labored very hard 
to preserve our tranquillity, but the peuple souverain 
is continually committing some intemperance or in 
discretion or other, tending to defeat all our precautions. If we are involved in a war, my head, heart 
and hands shall be guiltless of the crime of provoking it. But it will be my duty to submit to the legal 
voice and decree of my country. 
</p><p>
We have fine rains here for three days past, and I 
hope you enjoy a similar blessing. I shall take leave 
on Saturday, 31st of May, but cannot hope to get 
home before the 10th or 12th of June. The journey 
lies before me like a mountain. I am too old and too 
feeble for these long journeys, dry sessions, and un 
comfortable scenes. I am at an age when I ought to 
be at home with my family. 
I wish you an agreeable election. Who will be 
Lieutenant Governor, Gill or Gerry ? I wrote to Dr. 
Willard, sometime ago, a resignation of the chair of 
the Academy of Arts and Sciences. It would be a 
farce for rne to hold it any longer. My duty to my 
mother. Tell my brother that I suppose he was for 
war to make himself popular ; but I am very sorry to 
find that warlike sentiments are popular in <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>. 
I am glad he is chosen, however, and hope he will 
get our town back to the county of Suffolk.

IT is proper that I should apprize you that the President has it in contemplation to send your son to Holland, that you may recollect yourself and prepare for 
the event. I make this communication to you in confidence, at the desire of the President, communicated 
to me yesterday by the Secretary of State. You 
must keep it an entire secret until it shall be announced to the public in the journal of the Senate. 
But our son must hold himself in readiness to come 
to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> to converse with the President, Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, &c., and 
receive his commissions and instructions without loss 
of time. He will go to <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> in the stage, and 
thence to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> by water, and thence to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> in the stage. He will not set out, however, 
until he is informed of his appointment. Perhaps 
the Senate may negative him and then his journey 
will be unnecessary. 
</p><p>
I shall go in the stage on Saturday to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
and be at home, I hope, by the 12th of June.

MY vote, I believe, will never be again given for an 
adjournment of Congress to an earlier day than that 
which is designated by the constitution, because I 
find that gentlemen cannot conveniently leave their 
plantations and professions in season to be here sooner. 
A fortnight has been already lost and we have no certainty of making a Senate on Monday. 
</p><p>
By the papers that wrap Dumouriez's Memoirs, you 
will see the drooping state of a silly and wicked rebellion. Lee, assisted by Hamilton perhaps, appears with dignity, moderation and decision. The 
triumph of Smith, Ames, and Dexter, is very exhila 
rating to the friends of peace, and equally mortifying 
to the unblushing advocates of confusion.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YESTERDAY I attended the dedication of a temple. 
The Presbyterian congregation in Market street have 
taken down their old meeting house and erected a 
new one in the same place, much larger, higher, 
more light, airy and elegant. They assembled in it 
for the first time yesterday, when Dr. Ewing preached 
in the morning, and Dr. Blair in the afternoon. 
</p><p>
I recollected with pleasure, upon this occasion, the 
course of sermons delivered in rotation by the ministers of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> in the new church in Brattle street, and 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> got nothing by the comparison. Dr. 
Blair, however, entertained us with an elegant and 
sublime discourse, in which, among other good things, 
he gave Tom Paine a hearty reprobation. 
</p><p>
I dined at Mr. O's. All well. I hope to receive a 
line to-day. A journal or diurnal register of farming 
would be very, very refreshing and entertaining. 
O ! the tedious solitude that awaits me for three or 
four months amidst the noise, smoke, wealth, luxury, 
eloquence, learning, wit and wisdom, of this proud 
city and our venerable Congress ! To me, one week 
of domestic felicity and rural amusement would be 
worth it all.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE President's speech is so important to the public, 
that I know you will be anxious to see it as early as 
possible. When the answers of the two Houses come 
to be debated, we shall see whether there are any 
apologists for rebellion in these sanctuaries. 
</p><p>
As Mr. Edwards of Kentucky appeared in Senate 
to-day, we can do business if one member should be 
sick, but it will be very inconvenient to have so small 
a majority. Mr. Potts of Maryland, and Mr. Taylor 
of Virginia have resigned. The Senate seems really 
to be too small a body for so important a branch of 
the legislature of so great a people. 
</p><p>
I feel, where I am, the want of the society of Mr. O.'s family, but much more that of my own. I pore 
upon my family at <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>, my children in Europe, 
and my children and grandchildren in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, till 
I am melancholy, and wish myself a private man. 
That event, however, would not relieve me, for my 
thoughts would be at the <a href='/results.php?city=hague' rel='city'>Hague</a> and at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, if 
I was at <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>. Your meditations cannot be more 
cheerful than mine, and your visit to our afflicted sister will not, I fear, brighten your views or soften your 
anxiety. I hope we shall be supported, but there is 
no plan that occurs to me, that can relieve us from 
our solicitude. We must repose ourselves upon those 
principles in which we were educated, and which, I 
hope, we have never renounced nor relinquished. 
</p><p>
I would resign my office and remain with you, or I 
would bring you next winter with me, but either of 
these plans, the public out of the question, would in 
crease our difficulties, perhaps, rather than lessen 
them. This climate is disease to me, and I greatly 
fear would be worse to you, in the present state of 
your health. Mrs. Jay, poor lady, is more distressed 
than we are. I pray you to take care of your health 
and of L's too. She is a good girl : but I sometimes 
wish she would run about a little more, if it was even 
to look at the young men.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
IT is a common observation of old people, that as 
they advance in life, time appears to run off faster, 
and the year grows shorter. I cannot, I am sure, 
say the same of the time which has passed of late. 
I took possession of this chamber on the eighth of 
this month, and the time has seemed at least as long 
to me, as any fifteen days of my whole life. Tedious 
days and lonesome nights ! I am weary of ye ! 
</p><p>
Enclosed is the address of the Senate and the President's reply. You will be pleased with both, but 
wry faces, and shrill voices enough will be seen and 
heard in the House, the cities arid in some places in 
the country. What do you make of the intelligence 
from France ? They seem to be weary of clubs, but 
as yet unable to do without them. The explosion of 
their powder works and men seems as desperate as 
dreadful. Dreadful, awful revenge, I expect, will be practised in a thousand ways ; and as revenge excites 
revenge, where will it stop ? They seem at present to 
be unable to confine their enemies, or to set them at 
liberty. Sin and death seem to have deserted the 
place where Milton saw them, and taken their abode 
in Paris. 
</p><p>
I did not expect any letter from you last week, be- 
cause of your visit to Haverhill, and I was not disappointed, but if I should not receive one this week I should be mortified. 
</p><p>
The spirit in the two Houses has hitherto appeared 
well disposed to support the government, but whether 
the House will venture to censure a great number of 
their constituents so freely as the President and Senate 
have done, I know not. <a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Madison</a></a> and Mr. Scott 
upon the committee would not admit the clause into 
their report, and whether the House will insert it is 
not yet certain. An army of fifteen thousand militia 
so easily raised from four States only, to go upon 
such an enterprise ought to be a terrible phenomenon 
to anti-federal citizens as well as to insolent Britons. 
If our old stepmother continues to provoke us, till our 
patience is exhausted, she will soon see mischief to 
her dominions in America. But they will cost us 
infinitely more than they are worth. 
Adieu.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I RETURNED this day the visit of the cA-devant Due 
de Liancourt. He is a sensible man. He is cousin 
german of the late Due de la Rochefoucauld, and inherited his estate and, for what I know, his titles, but 
neither the estate nor the titles are of any use at present. What will be the future destiny of these high 
personages is a curious problem. I endeavored to impress upon him as I have upon all other Frenchmen, 
the necessity of an independent senate in France, 
incapable of being warped by ministers of state on 
one hand, or by popular demagogues on the other. 
</p><p>
I begin now to entertain hopes of soon hearing 
from our sons, to whom I have written by Mr. Green- 
leaf. 
</p><p>
This session of Congress is the most innocent I 
ever knew. We have done no harm. The English are so beaten and the French so triumphant, that 
I wonder there are not some projects for war. But it 
seems popularity is not now to be gotten by spirit. 
</p><p>
I know not what to write to you, unless I tell you 
I love you and long to see you ; but this will be no 
news. I wish I had a farm here. I would give you 
my chronicles of husbandry in return for yours. 
Three long months before I can see you. Oh ! what 
to do with myself I know not. 
</p><p>
My duty to my mother, and love to brothers and 
sisters and cousins. <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Morris</a> inquired of me the 
character of William Cranch. Be sure I gave him a 
good one. How is Mr. Wibird's health, and Mr. <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>'s ?

MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
ALTHOUGH the -weather is the most beautiful I ever 
knew in December, the time seems longer to me than 
ever any time did in America. The business of Congress this session is dulness, flatness, and insipidity 
itself. 
</p><p>
I have been much engaged in reading the trials of 
Muir, Margarot, Watt, Downie, and Walker. Mr. Walker, of Manchester, appears to have been very 
ill used by the church party ; but he was honorably 
acquitted. The others, I suppose, could not be held 
guiltless according to the laws of Scotland and England. The severity, however, of their sentences 
may excite rather than suppress discontent and mu 
tiny. Self-created societies must be circumspect. It 
is very easy for them to trangress the boundaries of 
law, and as soon as they do, they become unlawful 
assemblies, seditious societies, mischievous conventions, pernicious associations, dangerous and destructive combinations, and as many such hard appellations as you choose to give them. I take it for 
granted that political clubs must and ought to be lawful in every free country. I belonged to several in 
my youth, and I wish I could belong to one now. It 
would save me from ennui of an evening, which now 
torments me as bad as the blue devils would if I had 
them, which, by the way, I never had, and so can t 
say by experience. Low spirits and blue devils are 
not the same. 
</p><p>
I think I will read Svvedenborg's works. I dare 
say they are as entertaining as the Pilgrim's Progress, 
or Robinson Crusoe, or the Seven Champions. Any 
thing that shows a strong and strange imagination, 
and is neither melancholy nor stark mad, is amusing. 
I fear the atheistical and theistical philosophers, lately 
turned politicians, will drive the common people into 
receptacles of visionaries, enluminees, illuminees, 
&c., &c., &c., for the common people will undoubtedly insist upon the risk of being damned rather than 
give up the hope of being saved in a future state. 
The people will have a life to come and so will I. 
</p><p>
I fear you will think me a little crazy, so I conclude. I send you a history of Geneva.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
BY this day's post I have your letter of the 26th ultimo. I believe that some incomprehensible sympathy 
or other, made me low-spirited all the time you were 
sick, though I neither knew nor suspected it. I rejoice to be informed of your recovery. If I were 
not afraid of every change in your situation that 
might endanger your health, I would plan a project 
for next winter ; but I must leave that for a tete d 
tete. 
</p><p>
To a heart that loves praise so well, and receives 
so little of it, your letter is like laudanum, which <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='colleague'>Mr. Henry</a> the senator, says, is the Divinity itself. 
</p><p>
The French Convention has passed a number of 
resolutions for the regulation of Jacobinical clubs or 
self-created societies, founded in eternal reason, 
perpetual policy and perfect justice, which every 
other nation must adopt or be overthrown. I wish 
Mr. O. and every other minister would preach a sermon, once a quarter, expressly on that text. Affiliations, combinations, correspondences, corporate acts 
of such societies must be prohibited. A snake with 
one head at each end, crawling opposite ways, must 
split the snake in two, unless one head is so much 
stronger than the other as to drag it along over 
thorns and stones till it loses its headship. So the 
King of France's constitution acted. A man drawn 
between two horses is a neat image of a nation drawn 
between its government and self-created societies acting as corporations and combining together. 
</p><p>
Hay for the horses I know you must purchase, and 
I always expected it. Buy the best and enough of it. 
The weather is here this day as fine as you describe 
the day before Christmas, when our friends were so 
good as to visit you, bright, clear, mild ; farmers 
ploughing every where. Letters from Connecticut 
say the cankerworm millers, and slugs, are going up 
the apple trees. Tar our trees in the garden and see 
if you catch any. 
</p><p>
There is an unusual calm and dearth of news at 
present. Most important events are expected to be 
imported by the first vessels. I am myself much inclined to doubt whether the French will get to <a href='/results.php?city=amsterdam' rel='city'>Amsterdam</a>. There are obstacles in their way very 
serious and which may be made invincible. <a href='/results.php?city=amsterdam' rel='city'>Amsterdam</a> may be defended by an inundation. Even with 
out an inundation, it is capable of a good defence. 
A strong wall, a wide, deep ditch, a numerous artillery, and I am not willing to believe that the people 
are asleep or will be idle. I am, with the tenderest 
of all sentiments, 
</p><p>
Ever yours,

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE public prints announce the death of my old, 
esteemed friend General Roberdeau, whose virtues in 
heart-searching times endeared him to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> 
and to his country. His friendly attention to me 
when Congress held their sessions at <a href='/results.php?city=yorktown' rel='city'>Yorktown</a>, I can 
never forget, and it excites a more lively interest in 
his loss than that of some others who have lately 
gone before him. 
</p><p>
Mr. King is re-elected by the legislature of New 
York, by a majority of five in the house and two in 
the senate, in opposition to Mr. Tillotson, whom you 
know to have married a sister of Chancellor Livings 
ton. This is a great point gained. <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>, Chancellor Livingston, <a href='/results.php?tla=aab' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Burr</a>, Mr. Yates, and <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Hamilton</a>, are mentioned as successors to <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel=''>Governor Clinton</a>, who has resigned, <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>, if he should not 
return, will not run very fast. <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Hamilton</a>, it is 
said, will not serve. Chancellor will stand no chance, 
as I hear, and it is doubted whether Burr or Yates 
will prevail. We are still at uncertainties whether 
<a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>, or despatches from him, will arrive before 
the fourth of March, which makes me still dubious 
whether it will be right for me to go away. I am 
most earnestly and ardently desirous of it, but will it do? 
</p><p>
Mrs. Washington is very happy at present in a visit 
from her two granddaughters, N.'s sisters, as I suppose 
they are. One of them is a fine, blooming, rosy girl, 
who, I dare say, has had more liberty and exercise 
than Nelly. I dined yesterday at <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Morris</a>'s, whose 
hospitality is always precious. A company of venerable old rakes of us, threescore years of age, or 
a little over or a little under, sat smoking cigars, 
drinking Burgundy and Madeira, and talking politics 
till almost eleven o clock. This will do once in a great 
while, not often for me. 
</p><p>
In Senate, we have no feelings this session. All is 
cool. No passions, no animation in debate. I never 
sat in any public assembly so serenely. What storm 
may be preparing I know not. A great calm at sea, 
or an uncommonly fine day at land, is called a 
weather-breeder. But if Jay's despatches don t arrive, we shall have no tempestuous weather this session. I wish you a pleasant thanksgiving, though I 
fear I shall not be with you according to my wishes. 
</p><p>
Adieu. 
</p><p>
Instead of an additional snow and a return of cold, 
as I hoped this morning, we have now a warm and plentiful rain, which is melting the snow and 
spoiling the sleighing. I hope you have more snow, 
more steady cold, and good sledding. The post to 
day brought me no letter. I don t always very sanguinely look for a letter on Thursday. I should be 
inconsolable on a disappointment, on Monday.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THIS morning I received your favor of the 21st of 
January. I am sure your people do a great deal of 
work, so don t be concerned. I am very well satisfied with your agricultural diary. 
</p><p>
The venerable governor made the best speech he 
ever made, but the old leven ferments a little in it. 
I wonder you had not received two letters from T., 
which I enclosed to you. I now enclose you one from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>, which shows that our sons were arrived in 
Holland, and had passed through their ceremonies at 
the <a href='/results.php?city=hague' rel='city'>Hague</a>, and gone to <a href='/results.php?city=amsterdam' rel='city'>Amsterdam</a> to look, as I sup 
pose, after the imprudent Van Staphorst and American money in his hands. 
</p><p>
The enclosed postscript to Dunlap will show you 
that the expectation of a treaty hourly to arrive, will 
not allow me to leave my chair till the fourth of 
March. I shall be charged with deserting the President, forsaking the Secretary of State, betraying my 
friend Jay, abandoning my post, and sacrificing my 
country to a weak attachment to a woman, and a 
weaker fondness for my farm, if I quit at this moment. So, be thou thankful alone, that thou hast a 
good husband here, that thy children are safe and in 
honor in Europe, and that thy daughter has given 
thee a fine grand-daughter; besides innumerable blessings to thy country. I will be thankful and joyous 
here all alone. 
</p><p>
We momently expect the treaty ; but it may not 
arrive this month. When it does, I expect to see 
wry faces as well as smiling ones. Perhaps much 
debate may take place. Let us know what it is first, 
however, before we oppose, or criticise, or applaud, 
or approve. Your son John says it is better than war. 
That is all I know about it.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THIS is the coldest day we have felt this winter, and 
H it were not for the hope I have of a letter from you 
to-morrow, I should freeze, for what I know, to-night. 
This month has been all unpleasant weather, but 
none severe. You have had a north-east storm, I perceive, which raised the tides, but I hope, brought 
in a fresh and abundant supply of seaweed. 
</p><p>
It is the dullest time we have seen this winter. No 
arrivals, no news from abroad, nor from any part of 
our own country. The treaty appears not, and when 
it will, no man can tell. Are we to wait here till 
May for it ? I won t. There is not the smallest 
reason for my waiting. I can, in no possible case, 
have any voice in its ratification, as two thirds of the 
senators must agree. Nor will any opinion or reasoning of mine have the smallest weight with any 
one of the senators. If I were disposed to wait, how 
long must I wait ? I am tired of reading and writing. 
My eyes complain ; I want exercise ; I must have my 
horse ; and I must be at home. You say I must stay 
a few days at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ; but I shall be uneasy and 
impatient. No business, no books, no amusement, 
no society much suited to my taste. Good cheer is 
not enough for me. Balls, assemblies, hunting, are 
neither business, pleasure, nor diversion for me. 
What do you say, shall I resign my office when I am 
three-score, or will you come with me in a stage 
wagon, and lodge at a tavern in Fourth street ? I 
must contrive something new against next winter. 
The old routine grows too insipid. 
</p><p>
I shall never be weary of my old wife, however ; 
so declares

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE Senate assembled yesterday at eleven, twenty- 
five members present. The new senators were 
sworn, and a committee waited on the President, who 
immediately sent a message with the treaty, which 
was read, together with part of a volume of negotiations which accompanied it. Mr. Butler and Mr. Green arrived last night, as I hear, so that we shall 
be very full.

I can form no conjecture of the time when the Sen

THE Senate are now in possession of the budget. It 
is a bone to gnaw for the aristocrats as well as the 
democrats, and while I am employed in attending the 
digestion of it, I send you enclosed an amusement 
which resembles it only in name. I can form no 
judgment when the process will be over. We must 
wait with patience. 
</p><p>
I dined yesterday, in the family way, with the 
President. He told me that the American minister 
at the <a href='/results.php?city=hague' rel='city'>Hague</a> had been very regular and intelligent in 
his correspondence. The whole family made the 
usual inquiries concerning you and sent you the usual 
compliments.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
IT is painful to feel an impulse to write where there 
is nothing to say. I write merely to let you know 
that I am alive and not sick. The weather has been 
cold for several days, which is more tolerable, at least 
to me, than the heat which we suffered for a day or 
two the beginning of the week past. The new French 
minister is arrived. Whether he has any budget to 
disclose has not yet appeared, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a> is in fine spirits and his health improves. 
I should suppose he will remain here till the fate of 
his treaty is determined, which we hope, with some 
doubts however, will happen before the end of this 
week. Twenty-nine senators attended yesterday, 
and the thirtieth is expected to-morrow. We shall 
meet for the future at an earlier hour in the morning. 
The deliberations have been temperate, grave, decent 
and wise hitherto, and the results judicious. My absence from home at this season would be less distressing or rather less insipid, if my presence here was 
more necessary, or indeed of any utility, but to the 
mortification of separation from my family and affairs 
at a time when they would be most agreeable to me, 
is added the consciousness that I can do no good to 
others any more than to myself. I have no voice, 
and although the fate of the treaty will not be justly 
imputable to me in any degree, yet there is reason to 
expect that many will suspect me and others charge 
me with a greater share of it than would belong to 
me if I had a voice. All these things terrify me little.

A Mr. Millar, a son of a Professor Millar of Glasgow, known by his "Historical view of the English 
Government" last night brought me a letter of introduction and recommendation from Dr. Kippis, who 
desires his " sincere respects to every part of my 
family." In the midst of the desolations of Europe, 
he " rejoices in the prosperity of America, and in the 
wisdom and moderation of its two chief Governors." 
So much for compliment. Moderation, however, is 
approved only by the moderate, who are commonly 
but a few. The many commonly delight in some 
thing more piquant and lively. I am, with desires 
rather immoderate to be going home with you,

Yesterday I dined at Mr. Bingham's with a large 
company. While at table a servant came to me with 
a message from Mr. Law, who desired to speak with 
me in the anti-chamber. I went out to him and 
found that he wanted to enquire of me concerning a 
young lady of amiable manners and elegant education, whom Mr. Law and Mr. Greenleaf had found 
in Maryland, in great distress and a little disarranged, 
and brought with them to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. She is connected with families in Marblehead. I knew nothing 
of her. Governor Bradford says she has been some 
weeks in Rhode Island. I sent Mr. Law to Mr. Cabot.

Mr. Brown came in yesterday. He keeps with all 
the horses at the Rising Sun, between the fourth 
and fifth milestone in the country, at Mr. John Dove's. 
His horses are in fine order, but I shall not be in a 
condition to use them this week, I fear.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
LAST night the Consul General, de Etombe, made me 
a visit with your kind letter of the 18th. He looks 
older than when I last saw him, and he is indeed a 
fortunate man. He gave me many details of affairs 
in France ; a gloomy picture of the reign of terror, 
and a smiling one of the present reign of moderation ; 
but he is not without inquietude on the subject of a 
constitution. 
</p><p>
By the turn which the debates and deliberations in 
the Senate took yesterday, we must sit next week, 
and I have now little hope of liberty till the last day 
of it. Some members, perhaps, wish to give time 
to Mr. Adet to open his budget, which, it is conjectured, may contain propositions on the part of France. 
</p><p>
The sun is terrible here as well as at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
I beg you to be afraid of him, and keep out of his 
beams. I dread going out to Lansdowne to dinner at 
<a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Morris</a>'s, on Sunday, according to his invitation. 
</p><p>
The news you mention from <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a> is very disagreeable. I wish that misfortune and adversity could 
soften the temper and humiliate the insolence of 
John Bull ; but he is not yet sufficiently humbled. 
If I mistake not, it is to be the destiny of America 
one day to beat down his pride. But the irksome 
task will not soon, I hope, be forced upon us. 
</p><p>
All this is under the rose. My love to the family.

MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
I HAVE just received from the post office your letter of 
the 20th by Briesler, who went to carry one for you. 
I write by every post, i. e., by Monday's and Thurs 
day's, which are the only ones on which mails are 
made up for any place beyond <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and the only 
ones on which letters arrive here from any place be 
yond that city. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=aba' rel='spouse met friend'>Mrs. Adams</a>, your new daughter, behaves prettily in 
her new sphere. I dined with them one day, and 
promised to take my lodgings with them the next 
time. <a href='/results.php?tla=aba' rel='spouse met friend'>Mrs. Adams</a> showed me an elegant bed, 
which she politely said she had made up for me. As 
to the details in which you say the ladies excel us, I 
have not patience. I, who have the patience of Job, 
have not patience to write letters in the style of Grandison and Lovelace. You would admire to see with 
what serenity and intrepidity I commonly sit and hear. 
Not all the froth can move my contempt, not all the 
sedition stir my indignation, nor all the nonsense and 
delirium excite my pity. If dignity consists in total 
insensibility, I believe my countenance has it. B., 
however, tells me he can always perceive when I 
don t like any thing. It must be by reasoning from 
what he knows to be my opinion. My countenance 
shows nothing, for the most part. Sometimes I believe it may be legible enough. The reflections upon 
peace, by Madame de Stael, are not here. 
</p><p>
The President and Presidentess always send their 
regards to you. Madame invites you to come next 
summer to <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a> and visit the federal city. 
I am almost afraid to write it to you for fear it should 
turn your head, and give you thoughts and hopes of 
accepting the invitation. I told Madame la Presidente that, after the year <a href='/results.php?year=1800'>1800</a>, when Congress should sit at Washington, and that city became very great, I 
thought it not impossible that you and your sister Cranch might seriously entertain such a project, for 
the sake of making a visit to <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a> as well 
as seeing Mrs. Cranch's grandchildren. 
</p><p>
Always write me how Mrs. Briesler and her children are. It makes the good man's countenance 
shine so bright when I tell him of it, that I take a 
great pleasure in reading these paragraphs to him. 
My mother I am anxious to hear of. My duty to 
her, and love, compliments, &c., &c., to whom you 
please.

Always yours,

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
ENCLOSED is another production of Porcupine, whose quills will stick. 
</p><p>
" And Midas now neglected stands 
With ass's ears and dirty hands." 
</p><p>
The President appears great in Randolph's vindication throughout, excepting that he wavered about signing the treaty, which he ought not to have done 
one moment. Happy is the country to be rid of Randolph ; but where shall be found good men and true 
to fill the offices of government ? There seems to be 
a necessity of distributing the offices about the Stales 
in some proportion to their numbers ; but, in the 
southern part of the Union, false politics have struck 
their roots so deep that it is very difficult to find gentlemen who are willing to accept of public trusts, and, 
at the same time, capable of discharging them. The 
President offered the office of state to several gentlemen who declined : to Mr. Patterson, Mr. King, 
<a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='colleague'>Mr. Henry</a> of Virginia, Mr. Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, of South Carolina, and three others whose names 
I don t recollect. He has not been able to find any 
one to accept the war office. The expenses of living 
at the seat of government are so exorbitant, so far 
beyond all proportion to the salaries, and the sure re 
ward of integrity in the discharge of public functions 
is such obloquy, contempt, and insult, that no man of 
any feeling is willing to renounce his home, forsake 
his property and profession, for the sake of removing 
to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, where he is almost sure of disgrace and ruin. Where these things will end I know not. 
In perfect secrecy between you and me, I must tell 
you that I now believe the President will retire. The 
consequence to me is very serious, and I am not able, 
as yet, to see what my duty will .demand of me. I 
shall take my resolutions with cool deliberation. I 
shall watch the course of events with more critical 
attention than I have done for some time, and what 
<a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> shall point out to be my duty, I shall pursue with patience and decision. It is no light thing 
to resolve upon retirement. My country has claims, 
my children have claims, and my own character has 
claims upon me ; but all these claims forbid me to 
serve the public in disgrace. Whatever any one may 
think, I love my country too well to shrink from danger in her service, provided I have a reasonable prospect of being able to serve her to her honor and ad 
vantage. But if I have reason to think that I have 
either a want of abilities or of public confidence to 
such a degree as to be unable to support the government in a higher station, I ought to decline it. But 
in that case, I ought not to serve in my present place 
under another, especially if that other should entertain sentiments so opposite to mine as to endanger 
the peace of the nation. It will be a dangerous crisis in public affairs if the President and Vice President should be in opposite boxes. 
</p><p>
These lucubrations must be confined to your own 
bosom. But I think, upon the whole, the probability 
is strong that I shall make a voluntary retreat, and 
spend the rest of my days, in a very humble style, 
with you. Of one thing I am very sure it would 
be to me the happiest portion of my whole life. 
I am, with unabatable affection,

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THIS is one of my red letter days. It is the anniversary of the signature of the declaration of an armistice between the United States and Great Britain in 
<a href='/results.php?year=1783'>1783</a>. There are several of these days in my calendar, which I recollect as they pass in review, but 
which nobody else remembers. And, indeed, it is 
no otherwise worth my while to remember them than 
to render an ejaculation of gratitude to <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> 
for the blessing. 
</p><p>
We are wasting our time in the most insipid manner, waiting for the treaty. Nothing, of any consequence, will be done till that arrives and is mauled 
and abused, and then acquiesced in. For the antis 
must be more numerous than I believe them, and 
made of sterner stuff than I conceive, if they dare 
hazard the surrender of the posts and the payment for spoliations, by any resolution of the House 
that shall render precarious the execution of the 
treaty on our part. 
</p><p>
I am, as you say, quite a favorite. I am to dine 
to-day again. I am heir apparent, you know, and a 
succession is soon to take place. But, whatever may 
be the wish or the judgment of the present occupant, 
the French and the demagogues intend, I presume, to 
set aside the descent. All these hints must be secrets. 
It is not a subject of conversation as yet. I have a 
pious and a philosophical resignation to the voice of 
the people in this case, which is the voice of God. 
I have no very ardent desire to be the butt of party 
malevolence. Having tasted of that cup, I find it 
bitter, nauseous, and unwholesome. 
</p><p>
I hope Copeland will find his six loads to complete 
the meadow, and take the first opportunity to cart 
or sled the manure from the yard at home up to the 
top of Stonyfield hill. The first season that happens 
fit for ploughing, should be employed in cross ploughing the ground at home over the way. The news 
of my mother's arm growing better has given me 
great pleasure. Of the four barrels of flour I have 
shipped to you, present one of them to my mother 
from me, with my duty and affection. Tell my brother 
I hope he has seen his error, and become a better 
friend of peace and good government than he has 
been somewhat inclined to be since the promulgation 
of the treaty.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE House of Representatives will do no business, 
with any spirit, before the treaty arrives. The disaffected are intriguing, but accounts from all quarters 
are very discouraging to them. We have been very 
unfortunate in the delays which have attended the despatches of our ambassadors. Very lucky, <a href='/results.php?tla=jqa' rel="child met">Mr. John Quincy Adams</a>, that you are not liable to criticism upon this occasion ! This demurrage would 
have been charged doubly, both to your account and 
that of your father. It would have been a scheme, a 
trick, a design, a contrivance, from hatred to France, 
attachment to England, monarchical manoeuvres, and 
aristocratical cunning ! Oh ! how eloquent they would have been ! 
</p><p>
The southern gentry are playing, at present, a very 
artful game, which I may develope to you in confidence 
hereafter, under the seal of secrecy. Both in conversation and in letters they are representing the Vice 
President as a man of moderation. Although rather 
inclined to limited monarchy, and somewhat attached 
to the English, he is much less so than Jay or Hamilton. For their part, for the sake of conciliation, 
they should be very willing he should be continued as 
Vice President, provided the northern gentlemen 
would consent that Jefferson should be President. I 
most humbly thank you for your kind condescension, Messieurs Transchesapeakes.

YESTERDAY I came to the Senate, as usual on a Monday morning pleasing my imagination and my heart 
with the hope and expectation of a letter from 
my dearest friend. No letter for the Vice President!

All day in bad humor. Dirty weather wet walking nothing good nothing right.

I have had the agreeable society of Josiah Quinsy and Martin Lincoln to assist in consoling me a little of late.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
IT is Monday, the time to expect the eastern mail. 
Other men have letters, I have none. Humiliated 
and mortified, and, at the same time, irritated, I feel 
sometimes a disposition to abuse the post offices, 
sometimes to make a rash vow never to spend an 
other winter separated from my small family that re 
mains to me, but never once harbor a suspicion that 
madame may have omitted to write. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, however, my health and spirits 
have been better this winter than at any time since I 
had the ague, a blessing which I attribute to the free 
use of my horse the last summer. Health, and spirits, 
and leisure, have revived my old passion for reading 
to such a degree as, diverting me from my usual exercise of walking when I cannot ride, alarms me for 
the continuance of my health. A gloomy prospect, 
moreover, of four months longer attendance upon 
Congress, aggravated by the recollection that a few 
days later than this the last year, on the 19th of February, I got my release and liberty, makes a great defalcation from my philosophical serenity. While we are 
informed that you have plenty of snow and fine sled 
ding and sleighing, we have weather as mild as April, 
arid streets as dirty as March. 
</p><p>
No further news of the treaty, or any thing else, 
from Europe. Business in Congress as languid, as 
gaping and yawning as if Morpheus had poured out 
all his soporifics upon the two houses. The voice of 
faction, even, is scarcely heard. I suppose, however, 
when the treaty comes, he will lift up his notes like a 
trumpet. <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel=''>General Wayne</a> has returned and enjoyed 
his triumph. Judge Chase is here with the rest. Mr. Lee, the Attorney General, a brother of our friend 
the late member of the House and the late Governor 
of Virginia, married to a daughter of Richard Henry 
Lee, is arrived with his family. So is Mr. Me Henry, 
the Secretary at War. The offices are once more 
full. But how differently filled than when Jefferson, 
Hamilton, Jay, &c., were here ! The present incumbents not being much thought of, or at least talked 
of, for President, Vice President, or substitute for 
both, the public may be less disposed to fight for them 
or against them. The first situation is the great object of contention, the centre and main source of all 
emulation, as the learned Dr. Adams teaches in all 
his writings, and every body believes him, though no 
body will own it. 
My letters to you must never be seen by any body 
else. And I ought here to caution you to be very 
careful and reserved in showing our son's letters, for 
thousands are watching for his halting, as well as 
mine and yours. Mrs. Green, with her two daugh 
ters, is here, and mourns, in pathetic accents, that her 
friend, <a href='/results.php?tla=aba' rel='spouse met friend'>Mrs. Adams</a>, is not here, and so does

MR. NECKER, in his essay on the true principles of executive power in great states, chapter xii., says 
<block>
" C est apres avoir etc quelques annees au centre 
des affaires publiques, c est apres avoir ete, pour ainsi 
dire, im des axes autour duquel tous les interets per 
sonnels se mettent en mouvement, que Ton est in- 
struit, par soi-meme. de Pactivite de ces interets, et 
qu on apprend en meme-tems comment les hommes 
sont tour-a-tour animes, adouciset toujours enchaines 
par Pesperance. Souvent ils pensent a eux au mi 
lieu de toutes les negligences qu ils affectent, et au 
milieu meme des sacrifices, auxquels ils sont conduits 
par les circonstances. Ils ont, pour les jours de pa 
rade, ies sentimens les plus magnifiques ; mais, dans 
leurs habitudes journalieres, et dans leur confidences 
secretes, on voit qu ils sont preoccupes, les uns de 
leur fortune, et les autres des distinctions auxquels ils 
peuvent pretendre. Ainsi, n en doutons point, plus 
on reduit le cercle des encouragemens et des recompenses dont le monarque doit avoir la disposition, et 
plus on affoiblit entre ses mains Faction du pouvoir 
executif." 
</block>
A man who, like myself, has been, many more 
years than Mr. Necker ever was, in the centre of pub 
lic affairs, and that in a young country which has 
ever boasted of its simplicity, frugality, integrity, 
public spirit, public virtue, disinterestedness, &c.,can 
judge from his own experience of the activity of 
private interest, and perceive in what manner the hu 
man heart is influenced, irritated and soothed by 
hope. Neglects and sacrifices of personal interests 
are oftener boasted than practised. The parade and 
pomp, and ostentation, and hypocrisy, have been as 
common in America as in France. When I hear 
these pretensions set up, I am very apt to say to my 
self, this man deceives himself, or is attempting to 
deceive me. 
</p><p>
The various elections of the United States will 
soon call forth these personal interests in all their 
vigor, and all the arts of dissimulation to conceal 
them. T am weary of the game, yet I don t know 
how I could live out of it. I don t love slight, 
neglect, contempt, disgrace, nor insult, more than 
others. Yet I believe I have firmness of mind 
enough to bear it like a man, a hero, and a philosopher. I might groan like Achilles, and roll from 
side to side abed sometimes, at the ignorance, folly, 
injustice and ingratitude of the world, but I should 
be resigned, and become more easy and cheerful, 
and enjoy myself and my friend better than ever I 
did.

Charles came upon me by surprise last evening, 
by express from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, with the Algerine treaty

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE only time to inform you that Monday and 
Thursday have passed away without bringing me a 
letter from you. It is the first week that has failed 
me in the whole, though sometimes the letters have 
not arrived on the proper day. 
</p><p>
There is a Dr. somebody here from Connecticut, 
who pretends, with an instrument made of some kind 
of metal or composition of metals, by a sort of mesmerian rubbing, or stroking, or conjuration, to cure rheumatisms, headaches, pleurisies, and I know not 
what. Ellsworth will not say that he believes in it, 
but he states facts and tells stories. I expect the 
heads of all the old women, (males I mean, you 
know,) will be turned. They have got him into the 
President's house among some of his servants, and 
Mrs. Washington told me a story on Tuesday, before 
a number of gentlemen, so ineffably ridiculous that I 
dare not repeat it in writing. The venerable lady 
laughed as immoderately as all the rest of us did. 
</p><p>
A barrier is erected between Europe and America. 
It seems as if no vessel could get through or over it. 
I went with Charles last night to the drawing room. 
As the evening was fair and mild, there was a 
great circle of ladies and a greater of gentlemen. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel=''>General Wayne</a> was there in glory. This man's 
feelings must be worth a guinea a minute. The 
Pennsylvanians claim him as theirs, and show him a 
marked respect. 
</p><p>
W T e are now near the middle of February. Last 
year I left this place on the 19th. Now, I must 
stay through the long months of March, <a rel="month origin" value="4">April</a>, 
and May. Long ? Nothing is long ! The time will 
be soon gone, and we shall be surprised to know what 
is become of it. How soon will my sands be all run 
out of the glass ! After sixty, the days and hours 
have additional wings, which they wave and beat 
with increasing rapidity.

Dr. Priestley is here. I drank tea with him at the 
President's on Thursday evening. He says he always 
maintained against Dr. Price, that old age was the 
pleasantest part of life, and he finds it so. I think so 
too. One knows not what infirmities may come on, 
what pains, griefs or sorrows ? I am determined to 
make my small remainder as easy as I can, and en 
joy the hours as they pass, but do a little good as I 
have opportunity. 
</p><p>
You have not informed me whether you have let 
the farms. Duty and love as usual.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THIS morning I have your favor of the 3d, which 
raised my spirits again after the mortification of passing the whole of last week without one. 
</p><p>
Benjamin has grown very dull. No abuse no 
lies no terrors, no panics, no rant, in comparison 
of what he used to have. 
</p><p>
The subject which you think will excite all their 
feelings is well known to every body in public life, 
but is talked of by nobody but in confidence. I could name yon, however, as good federalists, and as good 
men as any, who think and say that he will retire, 
and that they would if they were he. And who 
would not? I declare upon my honor I would. After 
twenty years of such service with such success, and 
with no obligation to any one, I would retire, before 
my constitution failed, before my memory failed, be 
fore I should grow peevish and fretful, irresolute or 
improvident. I would no longer put at hazard a character so dearly earned, at present so uncontarninated, 
but liable by the weakness of age to be impaired in 
a moment. He has, in the most solemn manner, 
sworn before many witnesses at various times and on 
several occasions, and it is now, by all who are in the 
secret, considered as irrevocable as the laws of Medes and Persians. Your comments to Knox were perfectly delicate and perfectly wise. You need not tremble to think of the subject. In my opinion there is 
no more danger in the change, than there would be 
in changing a member of the senate, and whoever 
lives to see it, will own me to be a prophet. If Jay 
or even Jefferson (and one or the other it certainly 
will be) if the succession should be passed over, 
should be the man, the government will go on as well 
as ever. Jefferson could not stir a step in any other 
system than that which is begun. Jay would not 
wish it. The votes will run for three persons. Two, 
I have mentioned ; the third, being the heir apparent, 
will not probably be wholly overlooked. If Jefferson 
and Jay are President i nd Vice-President, as is not 
improbable, the other retires without noise, or cries, or 
tears to his farm. If either of these two is President 
and the other Vice-President, he retires without 
murmur or complaint to his farm forever. If this 
other should be President and Jefferson or Jay Vice- 
President, four years more, if life last, of residence 
in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> will be his and your portion, after 
which we shall probably be desirous of imitating the 
example of the present pair ; or if, by reason of 
strength and fortitude, eight years should be accomplished, that is the utmost limit of time, that I will 
ever continue in public life at any rate. 
</p><p>
Be of good courage therefore, and tremble not. I 
see nothing to appal me, and I feel no ill forebodings 
or faint misgivings. I have not the smallest dread of 
private life nor of public. If private life is to be my 
portion, my farm and my pen shall employ the rest 
of my days. 
</p><p>
The money of the country, the paper money is the 
most unpleasant object I see. This must have a 
remedy, and I fear it will be reserved for me to stem 
the torrent, a worse one than the western rebellion, 
or the opposition to the treaty. 
</p><p>
This is all in confidence and affection.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
LAST year I took French leave of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> to go 
home. This year I have the mortification to think 
we are not half way through the session. I see no 
prospect of getting away before the middle of June. 
</p><p>
There is nothing new, foreign or domestic. Electioneering begins to open her campaign. The letter 
from Jay, in the enclosed pamphlet, is called by the 
southern gentlemen, an electioneering letter. The 
toasts in the enclosed paper, are no doubt electioneering toasts. If Washington continues, I suppose Jeffer 
son and Jay may both be set up for Vice President. 
If he renounces, they will be set up for President and 
Vice President both, and let the lot come out as it 
will, the chief contest will be between these two, ac 
cording to present appearances. 
</p><p>
My mind, you know, is made up, and I am much 
at my ease. I am impatient and distressed while my 
mind is in suspense. Once decided, I have no longer 
any uneasiness. 
</p><p>
It cannot be long before we shall have news from 
Europe. My mother's relief from her fears respecting her arm is a great pleasure to me. I hope to see 
her in good health in June. Have you given her my 
barrel of flour ? You have had a fine season for your wood. I hope you have hoarded enough to last the year. 
</p><p>
Adieu.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I DINED yesterday with <a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Madison</a></a>. <a href='/results.php?tla=dol' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Madison</a> is a fine woman, and her two sisters are equally so. 
One of them is married to George Washington, one of the two nephews of the President who were some 
times at our house. <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Washington</a> came and civilly inquired after your health. These ladies, whose name was Payne, are of a Quaker family, once of North Carolina. 
</p><p>
The treaty with Spain is arrived, and is according 
to our wishes. The Algerine treaty is horridly costly. 
It is worse than the British, but will not be so fiercely 
opposed. 
</p><p>
There is no vessel here for <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. I cannot yet 
send any seeds. 
</p><p>
The great affair is as it was. I hear frequent reflections which indicate that Jefferson, although in 
good hands, he might do very well ; yet, in such 
hands as will hold him, he would endanger too much. 
Some persons of high consequence have spoken to 
me confidentially, but in general there is great delicacy on that head, and I hold an entire reserve. The 
question with me is between entire ease and entire 
disquietude. I will not fly from the latter, nor will I 
court it. I can live as happily without a carriage as Hamilton. 
</p><p>
Two great political questions have been agitated in 
the Supreme Court, one about Virginia debts paid 
into the treasury, the other, the constitutionality of 
the carriage tax. Hamilton argued this last with his 
usual splendor of talents and eloquence, as they say. 
In the course of his argument he said no man was 
obliged to pay the tax. This he knew by experiment ; for after having enjoyed the pleasure of riding 
in his carriage for six years, he had been obliged to 
lay it down again and was happy. 
</p><p>
There is no hope of getting away till June. The House never went so slowly on.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YESTERDAY the President sent his carriage for me to 
go with the family to the theatre. The Rage and 
the Spoiled Child were the two pieces. It rained 
and the house was not full. I thought I perceived a 
little mortification. Mr. George Washington and his 
fair lady were with us. 
</p><p>
Yours of the 21st gives me a satisfactory account 
of farming. I think I would engage Billings if I 
could. I must leave it to you to give him what you 
think fit. There is no vessel up for <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and seeds 
are very scarce and uncommonly dear. 
</p><p>
As to the subject of yours of the 20th, I am quite 
at my ease. I never felt less anxiety when any considerable change lay before me. Aut transit aut iinit. 
I transmigrate or come to an end. The question is 
between living at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> or at <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a> ; between 
great cares and small cares. I have looked into my 
self and see no meanness nor dishonesty there. I see 
weakness enough, but no timidity. I have no con 
cern on your account but for your health. A woman 
can be silent, when she will. 
</p><p>
After all, persuasion may overcome the inclination 
of the chief to retire. But, if it should, it will 
shorten his days, I am convinced. His heart is set 
upon it, and the turpitude of the Jacobins touches 
him more nearly than he owns in words. All the 
studied efforts of the federalists to counterbalance 
abuse by compliment don t answer the end. 
</p><p>
I suspect, but don t know, that Patrick Henry, <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>, and <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Hamilton</a>, will all be voted 
for. I ask no questions ; but questions are forced 
upon me. I have had some conversations purposely 
sought, in order, as I believe, indeed as I know, to 
convince me that the federalists had no thoughts of 
overleaping the succession. The only question that 
labors in my mind is, whether I shall retire with my 
file-leader ? I hate to live in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> in summer, 
and I hate still more to relinquish my farm. I hate 
speeches, messages, addresses and answers, procla 
mations, and such affected, studied, constrained 
things. I hate levees and drawing rooms. I hate to 
speak to a thousand people to whom I have nothing 
to say. Yet all this I can do. But I am too old to 
continue more than one, or at most more than two 
heats, and that is scarcely time enough to form, con 
duct and complete any very useful system. 
</p><p>
Electioneering enough we shall have. The en 
closed scraps will shew specimens.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I DINED yesterday with <a href='/results.php?tla=aab' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Burr</a>, who lives here in 
style. A number of members of the House, the 
Speaker Mr. Dayton, among the rest. It seems to be 
the general opinion that the House will express some 
opinions unfavorable to the treaty ; but finally carry 
it into effect. There is a good deal of apprehension 
expressed for the Union in conversation. Some think 
and say it cannot last. Such is the repugnance between the east and the west. 
The death of my aunt H., for by that name it is 
most natural for me to call her, is an event that was 
every day to be expected, and as her days of usefulness and satisfaction were past, can be no cause of 
rational grief to her nearest relations. It has not, 
however, failed to revive the remembrance of the 
scenes of my youth, of my father, my uncles, my 
aunts, and my cousins, many of whom were gone 
before her, and to affect me with many tender sentiments and serious reflections. Alas ! she was little 
more than thirty years older than myself. I shall 
never see her years. But why should I regret such 
a prospect as that ? Although I am convinced that 
human life is a happy and agreeable scene, a charming, delightful state, upon the whole, and although my 
share of it has been chequered with perplexities, difficulties, dangers and distresses, which fall to the lot 
of but few, yet it has been sweet and happy on the 
whole, and calls for gratitude to my Maker and Pre 
server. Yet every year, according to my opinions 
and persuasions and expectations, brings me nearer 
to a state of superior excellence and more unmixed 
enjoyment, where I hope to meet all my relations and 
other friends who may have done their duty in this. 
There, my dearest friend, may we meet, and never 
be again separated by any necessities to go to Eu 
rope, or <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, or elsewhere. 
</p><p>
My duty to my mother, and congratulate her on 
the recovery of her arm. I hope to see her again in 
June. But the House of Representatives will keep 
me here as long as possible. 
Your amanuensis improves in her hand-writing. 
She superscribes your letters elegantly. My love to 
her. I am not sorry that John went to England. 
He will have opportunities of improvement and gaining information there.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I COVET the harp of Amphion. What would I not 
give for the harp of Amphion ? 
</p><p>
In my walks in the cedar grove, in rocky run, and 
on Penn's hill, I should play upon my lyre, and the 
merry rocks would dance after me and reel into 
walls. This would be to me a very pleasant and 
profitable private amusement. But there is another 
use I could make of my instrument in my public 
employment, more grateful to a benevolent heart 
because more useful to mankind. In no age of the 
world was it more wanted. 
</p><p>
" Amphion thus bade wild dissension cease, 
And softened mortals learned the arts of peace. 
Amphion taught contending kings 
From various discords to create 
The music of a well tuned state ; 
</p><p>
Nor slack nor strain the tender strings 
Those useful touches to impart 
That strike the subject's answering heart, 
And the soft, silent harmony that springs 
From sacred union and consent of things." 
</p><p>
Alas ! I am not an Amphion. I have been thirty 
years singing and whistling among rny rocks, and not 
one would ever move without money. I have been 
twenty years saying if not singing, preaching if not 
playing 
</p><p>
" From various discords to create 
The music of a well tuned state ; 
And the soft, silent harmony that springs 
From sacred union and consent of things," 
</p><p>
but an uncomplying world will not regard my uncouth discourses. I cannot sing nor play. If I had 
eloquence, or humor, or irony, or satire, or the harp 
or lyre of Amphion, how much good could I do to the 
world ! What a mortification to my vanity ! What 
a humiliation to my self-love ! 
</p><p>
The rocks in the House of Representatives will not 
dance to my lyre. They will not accord to a " well 
tuned state." They will not endure " the harmony 
that springs from sacred union and consent of things." 
They are for breaking all the instruments hut that of 
the thorough bass, and then blowing you deaf and 
dumb. There are bold and daring strides making to 
demolish the President, Senate, and all but the House, 
which, as it seems to me, must be the effect of the 
measures that many are urging. Be not alarmed, 
however, they will not carry their point. The treaty 
will be executed, and that by the consent of the 
House. 
</p><p>
I am going to hear Dr. Priestley. His discourses 
are learned, ingenious, and useful. They will be 
printed, and, he says, dedicated to me. Don t tell 
this secret though, for no other being knows it. It 
will get me the character of a heretic, I fear. I presume, however, that dedicating a book to a man will 
not imply that he approves every thing in it. 
</p><p>
The weather is so fine that I long to be upon my 
hills. Pray, since my harp cannot build walls, how 
do my friends go on who are obliged to employ their 
elbows in that laborious work ? 
</p><p>
I sometimes think that if I were in the House of 
Representatives, and could make speeches there, I 
could throw some light upon these things. If <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> should be President, I believe I must put up 
as a candidate for the House. But this is my vanity. 
I feel sometimes as if I could speechify among them, 
but, alas, alas ! I am too old. It would soon destroy 
my health. I declare, however, if I were in that 
House, I would drive out of it some demons that 
haunt it. There are false doctrines and false jealousies predominant there at times that it would be 
easy to exorcise. 
</p><p>
You see I mind no order in what I write to you. I 
know your criticism will not be cruel to

MT DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
WE have a turn of weather as cold as any we have 
had through the whole winter. The violence of the 
north-west wind, which has thrown down chimneys 
and blown off roofs in this city, we suppose, has pre 
vented the eastern mail from crossing the North River 
and deprived me of my Thursday's letter as yet. I 
hope it will come to-day. 
</p><p>
A thousand and one speeches have been made in 
the House of Representatives upon the motion for 
petitioning the President for papers. Twenty complete demonstrations have been made of the constitutionality of it, and twenty more of its unconstitutionally. Ten of its expediency, and as many of its in 
expediency. Five of its utility, and the same number of its inutility. After all, they will ask and receive, and then lash and maul awhile, and then do the 
needful. I dined on the 17th with the friendly sons 
of St. Patrick, and to-day I dine with Rush. Judge 
Gushing departs this morning, and Mrs. Gushing will 
call upon you. Ellsworth embarks in a day or two 
for South Carolina and Georgia. 
</p><p>
We have a party business from Kentucky ; a strange 
complaint against Mr. Marshall, which obliges us to 
sit to-day, Saturday. I regret this, because it is too 
exhausting to me to sit so constantly. My task is 
pretty severe, especially in cold weather. This wind 
will delay intelligence from Europe for ten days or a 
fortnight. Liancourt is going with Ellsworth, and 
Talleyrand talks of embarking for Hamburg. Having no horse, and reading more and walking less than 
usual, I am solicitous about my health. The birds, in 
numbers and variety, began to sing, and the grass to 
grow green, before this last gripe of Queen Mab. 
The poor birds have hard times now. 
</p><p>
I cannot see a ray of hope before June. If the 
House should be frenzical, we must sit till next March, 
and leave it to the people to decide by choosing a new 
President, Senate and House, who will harmoniously 
go all lengths, call George a tyrant to his face, the 
English nation pirates, break the treaty, enter into an 
alliance offensive with France, and go to war with 
spirit, consistency and dignity. But I believe the 
House will adopt the language which says that the 
just keep their promises though they have made 
them to their hurt, and that they must make the best 
of a bad bargain, and come off thus, as well as they 
can, by abusing Jay, President, and Senate, and 
treaty, without pretending to annul it.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
ON Wednesday I dined with Mr. Russell, the friend 
of Dr. Priestley, and while we were at table, in came 
large packets of letters and newspapers from Eng 
land. The ladies at table had letters from their 
friends, and the scene was so lively, so much like 
what I had often felt, that it put me into very good 
humor. The news was what you will see in Fenno's 
paper. 
</p><p>
Yesterday I dined at the President's, with ministers 
of state and their ladies, foreign and domestic. After dinner the gentlemen drew off after the ladies, 
and left me alone with the President in close conversation. He detained me there till nine o clock, and 
was never more frank and open upon politics. I find 
his opinions and sentiments are more exactly like 
mine than I ever knew before, respecting England, 
France, and our American parties. He gave me intimations enough that his reign would be very short. 
He repeated it three times at least, that this and that 
was of no consequence to him personally, as he had 
but a very little while to stay in his present situation. 
This must be a confidential secret. I have hinted it 
to no one here. The President told me he had that 
day received three or four letters from his new minister in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, one of them as late as the 29th of 
December. <a href='/results.php?tla=tip' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Pickering</a> informs me that Mr. Ad 
ams modestly declined a presentation at court, but it 
was insisted on by Lord Grenville ; and, accordingly, 
he was presented to the King, and I think, the Queen, 
and made his harangues and received his answers. By 
the papers I rind that Mr. Pinckney appeared at court 
on the 28th of January, after which, I presume, <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='me'>Mr. Adams</a> had nothing to do but return to Holland. The 
appearances of peace are as yet but faint. 
</p><p>
The House of Representatives have applied for 
papers, and the President has their request under 
consideration. He is not at all pleased with this. 
A motion is now before the House, made by Mr. Harper, that it be resolved that provision be made 
to carry into execution all the treaties yet published. How long this will be debated I know not. 
There is danger that the delay on our part will occasion delays on the part of Britain, but I hope not. 
Three of our representatives, Lyman, Dearborn, and Varnum, voted against all New England, except one, 
I believe, in Vermont. The loss of Mr. Ames and 
Mr. Dexter, has been much lamented. Varnum, 
and Lyman, and Dearborn, are as inveterate as Giles, 
by all that I hear. 
</p><p>
I have not yet seen my son's public letters. There 
is such rancor of party that the prospect of a change 
in administration quite cures me of all desire to have 
a share in it. Repose and poverty, I say. Yet I am 
not intimidated. Renegadoes and adventurers from 
foreign countries acquire such an influence among 
the people, although there is no attachment in their 
nature to us or our country, and there is every reason 
to suspect the worst influence over them ; and sensible 
people are so fearful of provoking their wrath and 
impudence by exposing them, that it is really disgusting to enter on any public stage. The people are so 
abused and deceived, and there is so little care or 
pains taken to undeceive and disabuse them, that the 
consequences must be very disagreeable. I am, with 
undiminished attachment, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE House of Representatives have not yet deter 
mined. The question is to be called up on Monday. But the opposition, who now call themselves 
the virtuous majority, will endeavor still to postpone 
it. It is now avowed by Mr. Bond, the British charge 
d affaires, that the surrender of the posts is suspended 
upon the determination of the House of Representatives. And who could expect it would be otherwise ? 
I have read " the minister s" despatches from Lon 
don. The King could not help discovering his old 
ill humor. The mad idiot will never recover. Blunderer by nature, accidents are all against him. Every 
measure of his reign has been wrong. It seems they 
don t like Pinckney. They think he is no friend to 
that country, and too much of a French Jacobin. 
They wanted to work up some idea or other of introducing another in his place, but our young politician 
saw into them too deeply to be duped. At his last 
visit to court, the king passed him without speaking 
to him, which you know will be remarked by courtiers of all nations. I am glad of it ; for I would 
not have my son go so far as <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>, and affirm the 
friendly disposition of that country to this. I know 
better. I know their jealousy, envy, hatred, and revenge, covered under pretended contempt.

I am so fatigued and disgusted with the insipidity 
of this dull life, that I am half of a mind to vow that 
if Washington don t resign, I will. The old hero 
looks very grave of late. However, there is a high 
probability that I am upon my last year of public 
life, for if there should not be a choice by the people, 
I will not suffer a vote to be given for me in the 
House of Representatives. I will never serve in that 
high and responsible situation without some foundation of people to stand on. If I should be chosen 
Vice President only by a plurality, I will refuse. In 
short, there are so many probable cases in which I 
am determined to retire that the probability of it is, 
upon the whole, very strong. Indeed, I feel myself 
to be a fool to serve here at all. 
</p><p>
I am glad that you cast off the fret upon your mind. 
You received some post notes soon after the date of 
yours of 28th of March, which enabled you to face 
your creditors and gave you more courage, I hope.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I DINED on Monday at the Presidents with young La Fayette and his preceptor, tutor or friend, whatever 
they call him, whose name is Frestel. I asked them 
with Mr. Lear to breakfast with me this morning and 
they agreed to come ; but last evening, Mr. Lear 
came with a message from the President to ask my 
opinion whether it would be advisable for the young 
gentleman, in the present circumstances of his father 
and mother and whole family, and considering his 
own tender years, to accept invitations and mingle in 
society ? Whether it would not too much interrupt 
his studies ? The youth and his friend had proposed 
these questions to the President and asked his advice, 
and expressed their own opinion, that retirement 
would be more advisable and more desirable. I agreed 
in opinion with the President and his guests, and as I 
had been the first who had invited them, at the President's request agreed to excuse them from accepting 
my invitation, that they might have it to say as a 
general apology that they had accepted none. There 
is a resemblance of father and mother in the young 
man. He is said to be studious and discreet. I hope 
he will live to become as respectable, and a more 
fortunate man than his father. You must have 
known him at five or six years of age, as well as his 
sister Anastasia, who is now with her parents. 
</p><p>
The majority of the House of Representatives appear to be resolute to do nothing. In fact they have 
done nothing, and Mr. Giles boasts that he has a majority of ten determined to do nothing concerning the 
treaty with England. For my own part, I see no 
thing better than a crisis working up, which is to determine whether the constitution is to be brought to 
its end this year, or last a few longer. Not the tavern at Cowes, not the tavern at Harwich or at Helvoet, not the taverns at Nantes, L Qrient, and Brest, 
nor the calms, storms and contrary winds of a long 
voyage at sea, nothing but a journey through Spain, 
from <a href='/results.php?city=ferrol' rel='city'>Ferrol</a> to Fontarabia is more tedious than the 
operations of our government under this constitution. 
</p><p>
I have received your's of April 1. You must get 
labor as reasonably as you can. But I almost wish 
we had let our homestead upon shares as well as the 
others. Another year I will, if I don t stay at home 
to take care of it.

I am, affectionately,

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE Doctor may have the steers if he wishes to have them. 
</p><p>
The people of the United States are about to be 
stirred up in every quarter of the union. The House 
of Representatives are determined to go all lengths. 
The merchants of this city have had the most numerous meeting that has been known for a long time, 
and unanimously voted to petition, that the faith, the 
honor, and the interest of the nation may be preserved. They have appointed committees to correspond 
with the merchants in all the seaports. I expect that 
the citizens will also be called together in the state 
house yard and it is said that the gentlemen will turn 
out, but the event will be doubtful. The state parties 
will all be agitated, and party spirit will be carried 
to the highest pitch. It must be a national determination, and if the nation solemnly determines upon 
war and confusion, they ought not to charge it to the 
government. These critical situations are familiar 
to me, and I always feel calmest in the midst of them. 
A few outlandish men in the House have taken the 
lead, and Madison, Giles and Baldwin are humble fol 
lowers. If the voice of the nation should be finally 
and decidedly in favor of the treaty, there will be a 
mortified party, so bitter, rancorous and desperate, 
fomented by foreign influence, in opposition, that the 
government will be very much embarrassed, and the 
public service very uncomfortable. 
</p><p>
When I take a walk out of town and see the young 
clover beautifully starting, I long to see my own. 
Pray how fares it ? 
</p><p>
I have always thought it injudicious to make any 
attempt against the governor, knowing as I do, the 
habitual attachment to him, as well as the difficulty 
of uniting people in another. The countenance he 
gives to a very profligate party, is very pernicious to 
the public, but he is stimulated to it in part by the 
opposition to him, and he would not do less out of 
office. The constitution of our government is calculated to create, excite and support perpetual parties 
in the States, mixing and crossing alternately with 
parties in the federal government. It will be a perpetual confusion of parties. I fear we do not deserve 
all the blessings we have within our reach, and that 
our country must be deformed with divisions, contests, 
dissensions and civil wars as well as others. 
</p><p>
As the people of Rome scrambled for power 
against the senate ; as the people of Athens scram 
bled for more power than was reserved for them by 
the laws of Solon ; as the people of Carthage scram 
bled for power against their senate ; as the people of 
England scrambled for power against the king and 
lords, and set up Oliver; as the people of France 
scrambled for power against every majority and set 
up Robespierre ; so the House of Representatives of 
the United States will scramble for power against the 
President and Senate. And the frequency of popular elections will corrupt all before them. May God 
of his infinite mercy grant that some remedy may be 
found before it be too late, in the good sense of this 
people. 
</p><p>
Mr. C. desires me " to present his most profound 
respects, not daring to send by a husband, any more 
affectionate regards." 
</p><p>
I will venture to present you with my most affectionate regards, my earnest wishes and longing de 
sires to see you.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE sensations of 19th <a rel="month origin" value="4">April</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1775'>1775</a>, and those of this 
morning, have some resemblance to each other. A 
prospect of foreign war and civil war in conjunction, 
is not very pleasant. We are a poor, divided nation, 
in the midst of all our prosperity. The House of 
Representatives, after debating three weeks about 
asking for papers, are now beginning another discus 
sion, which may last as long, on the merits and de 
merits of the treaty. If the House refuse to make 
the appropriations, it is difficult to see how we can 
avoid war, and it is not easier to find out how we can 
preserve this government from dissolution. We must, 
however, coolly and patiently study and search for 
the means and resources which may be left to avoid 
war and support government. Mr. Swift and Mr. Good hue have spoken ably in favor of the treaty, 
and Mr. Nicholas and Mr. Giles spoke more moderately against it than was expected. 
</p><p>
I had no letter from you yesterday. Briesler says 
the mail goes now three times a week, on Tuesdays, 
Thursdays, and Saturdays. I shall endeavor to write 
by each, though it may he but a line of remembrance. 
I hope your indisposition was not a grave one ; but 
the omission of a letter yesterday gave me some 
fears. 
</p><p>
I cannot deny the right of the House to ask for 
papers, nor to express their opinions upon the merits 
of a treaty. My ideas are very high of the rights arid 
powers of the House of Representatives. These 
powers may be abused, and in this instance there is 
great danger that they will be. Such a combination 
of party motives as debts, anti-federalism and French 
influence, seldom occurs to overawe the members and 
lead them into party violence. But the faith and hon 
or of the nation are pledged, and though the House 
cannot approve, they ought to feel themselves bound. 
Some persons still think the House will comply. But 
there is an inveteracy and obstinacy on this occasion 
such as I scarcely ever saw. The pride of Madison, 
Giles, Baldwin, ill brooking the superior powers of the 
Senate, emulating the dignity and lustre of members 
of that body, ardently struggling to rival an Ellsworth, 
a King, &c. These are feelings that our law-givers, 
in framing our constitution, did not advert to. The 
elections of the two Houses by such different bodies 
as the people and their legislators, will always leave 
this difficulty in full force. The leading members of 
the House, such as Madison, and Baldwin, should have 
been ere now senators. 
</p><p>
But I must not speculate. I must come to some 
thing more pleasing, assurances of the perpetual affection of

MY DEAREST FRIEND,

I HAVE received in your favor of the 15th an entertaining account of Vortigern and Rowena.
</p><p>
Our wagon is mired to the axletree in a bog, and 
unable to advance or retreat. The people only can 
draw it out ; but whether it will be backwards or for 
wards I know not. The horses upon Portland hill 
employed to draw up hill, are so equally matched 
with the load and those behind, that the wheels can 
roll neither up nor down. Pegged like Ariel in a rifted oak, we can only sprawl in the air with our 
arms and legs, and fill the atmosphere with our cries 
and clamors. 
</p><p>
I forgot to mention the young men's land. I must 
have it. I always understood there were but eleven 
acres. The price is exorbitant. But pray the doc 
tor to make the best bargain he can, and finish the 
business. I mean the land of the young Haydens.

The charming letter from our son I return. I 
know very well all his meaning. He will see man 
kind in his youth.

Yours of the 18th reached me in four days, i. e., 
on the 22d. I know your difficulties. I mean to do 
very little at farming. I will let out on shares all I 
have next year. I see no prospect of leaving this 
city before the fifth or sixth of June. Obstinacy 
must be resisted with rational firmness and steadiness.

MT DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I AM not surprised at your anxiety expressed in your 
letter of the 25th, which I received yesterday. The conduct of certain mules has been so gloomy and obstinate for five months past, as to threaten the most 
dangerous effects. The proceedings of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, New 
York, and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> now, compared with their in 
temperate folly last July or August, is a curious specimen of negotiations with foreign courts and nations 
by the people at large in town meetings. Those 
cities have disgraced themselves and their leaders. 
</p><p>
The House yesterday, in committee, voted to make 
the appropriations, but in the House they will disgrace 
themselves again by party manoeuvres to-day, and by 
factious preambles or preparatory resolutions. Our V , who is as cross a goat as any from Virginia, not excepting Rutherford, was out of the way. An 
other member, Patten from Delaware, was absent. 
Both will vote to-day against the resolution ; so that 
the business is still in suspense, and the anxiety and 
vigilance of the people ought not to relax. Mr. Ames, the day before yesterday, in his feeble state, 
scarcely able to stand upon his legs, and with much 
difficulty finding breath to utter his periods, made one 
of the best speeches he ever produced, to the most 
crowded audience ever assembled. He was attended 
to with a silence and interest never before known, 
and he made an impression that terrified the hardiest 
and will never be forgotten. Judge Iredell and I 
happened to sit together. Our feelings beat in unison. " My God ! how great he is," says Iredell, 
" how great he has been !" " He has been noble," 
said I. After some time Iredell breaks out, " Bless 
my stars, I never heard any thing so great since I 
was born ! " " It is divine," said I ; and thus we 
went on with our interjections, not to say tears, till the 
end. Tears enough were shed. Not a dry eye, I 
believe, in the House, except some of the jackasses 
who had occasioned the necessity of the oratory. 
These attempted to laugh, but their visages " grinned 
horribly ghastly smiles." They smiled like Foulon's 
son-in-law when they made him kiss his father's 
dead and bleeding head. Perhaps the speech may 
not read as well. The situation of the man excited 
compassion, and interested all hearts in his favor. 
The ladies wished his soul had a better body. 
</p><p>
We are told Harri. Otis excelled at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and 
displayed great oratorical talents. I cannot give 
encouragement, nor entertain any hope, of getting 
away before the fifth of June, unless the hard hearts 
should be softened. The heart of Pharaoh was judicially hardened and so are those of . Massachusetts has three of the worst.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE result of Saturday's debate in the House of 
Representatives removes all anxiety for the remainder 
of this session, and leaves me at liberty to ask leave to 
go home. The state of my own health, which requires 
relaxation, and the sickness in my family and neighborhood, would have well justified me if I had retired 
even before the great question was decided. I shall ask 
leave this day, unless something unforeseen should 
happen to prevent me. If I should obtain leave of 
absence after Thursday next, I shall be at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
on Sunday. Whether I shall go by water or land 
from thence, will depend upon circumstances. Some 
time in the course of the week after next, I hope to 
see you, but there are so many circumstances of 
wind and weather, as well as other things, which may 
intervene, that I cannot make any disposition by which 
I can calculate to a day or a week when I shall get home. 
</p><p>
It is a mortifying consideration that five months 
have been wasted upon a question whether national 
faith is binding on a nation. Nothing but the ignorance and inexperience of this people can excuse 
them. Really, we have not a right sense of moral 
or national obligation. We have no national pride, 
no national sense of honor. I suppose the decision 
of the House has determined the President's resignation and retirement. And the question who shall succeed him may occasion as much controversy and animosity as the treaty with Great Britain, which was 
ultimately determined by no proper considerations of 
merit, but merely by fear of constituents in many. 
</p><p>
If my plan should be altered in any respect, I shall 
write you an account of it. I must spend a little 
time with the children at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I have been 
five months without once mounting a horse and with 
out one long walk, so that, although I have walked 
every day more or less, I am under some fears of the 
effect upon my health of a journey of a hundred 
miles a day in a stage.

The enclosed letters please to file away carefully 
with the others.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
WE lodged at Monroe's, in Marlborough, on Wednesday night ; at Hitchcock's, in Brookfield, Thursday 
night ; at David Bull's, in <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, Friday night, and 
at Lovejoy's, in Stratford, last night. I have been to 
hear sound orthodox Calvinism from Mr. Stebbins, 
this morning. 
</p><p>
At <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a> I saw Mr. Adet's note, in folio, to our 
Secretary of State, and I find it an instrument well calculated to reconcile me to private life. It will purify 
me from all envy of <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, or Mr. Pinckney, or <a href='/results.php?tla=aab' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Burr</a>, or Mr. any body who may be chosen President or Vice President. Although, however, I think 
the moment a dangerous one, I am not scared. Fear 
takes no hold of me and makes no approaches to me 
that I perceive, and if my country makes just claims 
upon me, I will be as I ever have been, prompt to 
share fates and fortunes with her. I dread not a war 
with France or England, if either forces it upon us, 
but will make no aggression upon either with my free 
will, without just and necessary cause and provocation. In all events of peace or war, I think prices 
must fall considerably before spring, lands, labor, pro 
visions and all. 
</p><p>
We have had so cold a journey thai I fear our 
stone wall stands still. If it does, however, I sup 
pose manure, or ploughing, or cutting and carting 
wood, will furnish employment enough. 
</p><p>
Nothing mortifies me more than to think how the 
English will be gratified at this French flight. John 
Bull will exult and shrug his shoulders like a French 
man, and I fear, show us some cunning, insidious 
kind of kindness upon the occasion. I should dread 
his kindness as much as French severity, but will be 
the dupe of neither. If I have looked with any ac 
curacy into the hearts of my fellow citizens, the 
French will find, as the English have found, that feelings may be stirred which they never expected to find 
there, and that, perhaps, the American people them 
selves are not sensible are within them. 
</p><p>
I shall write you from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. This cold weather makes me regret the loss of my bed and fireside, and especially the companion and delight of both.

MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
to this city on Friday night, after a cold ride 
of eighty miles from Elizabethlown. There are 
great complaints of want of water, for grinding, for 
cattle and for families, through the whole country. 
</p><p>
Yesterday I dined with the President, in company 
with John Watts, the king of the Cherokees, with a 
large number of his chiefs and their wives ; among 
the rest the widow and children of Hanging Maw, a 
famous friend of our's who was basely murdered by 
some white people. The President dined four sets of 
Indians on four several days the last week. 
</p><p>
The French manoeuvres have gained the votes of Pennsylvania, and how many others is unknown. The election will be a meagre one and I shall not envy it. 
I showed the letters of Mr. <a href='/results.php?tla=jqa' rel='met colleague child'>J. Q. A.</a> to the President, who told me that things appeared to him exactly as they did to his minister. To-day he has sent me a letter 
to him from Mr. T. Paine, dated at Paris, 20 of September, <a href='/results.php?year=1795'>1795</a>, which he said was the most insulting letter he ever received. Paine accuses the President 
of connivance at his imprisonment in France, thinks he ought to have interposed in his behalf and reclaimed him. 
</p><p>
" I ought not to have suspected you of treachery, 
but I must continue to think you treacherous, till you 
give me cause to think otherwise. I am sure you 
would have found yourself more at your ease if you 
had acted by me as you ought, for whether your desertion of me was intended to gratify the English government, or to let me fall into destruction in France that 
you might exclaim the louder against the French revolution, or whether you hoped by my extinction to 
meet with less opposition in mounting up the American government, either of these will involve you in 
reproach, you will not easily shake off." These are his words. 
</p><p>
Mr. Paine's long threatened pamphlet against the President, it is supposed, is arrived, and Mr. Bache is 
to publish it in the form of a letter to George Washington. It is even said that a patent is to be obtained 
for the exclusive privilege of publishing it. 
</p><p>
Whether the French Directory have only been 
drawn in to favor the election of a favorite, or whether 
in their trances and delirium of victory they think 
to terrify America, or whether in their sallies they 
may not venture on hostilities, time will discover. 
Americans must be cool and steady if they can. 
Some of our people may be cured of their extravagant love and shaken in their unlimited confidence. 
The French character, whether under monarchical or 
republican government, is not the most equitable nor 
the least assuming of all nations. The fire, impetuosity and vehemence of their temperament is apt to 
be violent, immoderate and extravagant. The pas 
sions are always outrageous. A Frenchman in love 
must shoot himself or succeed. A Frenchman in 
anger must shed the blood of his object, and so of 
the rest. 
</p><p>
I hope we shall make two houses to-morrow. My 
duty to my mother and love to all.

MY DEAREST FRIEND,

ENCLOSED are some signal accomplishments of prophecies. Be cool and discreet in your communications 
of them. No such person as Jasper D wight is known 
to either of the senators of Vermont. The signature 
is thought to be fictitious. I have no letter from you 
later than the Sunday after my departure. Major 
Butler has indeed resigned. 
</p><p>
They kept back Paine's letter several weeks, presuming no doubt that it would not promote their election. It appeared for the first time, this morning. I 
think, of all Paine's productions it is the weakest, 
and at the same time, the most malicious. The man 
appears to me to be mad, not drunk. He has the 
vanity of the lunatic who believed himself to be Jupiter, the father of gods and men. There is a Dr. 
E. here, a relation of <a href='/results.php?tla=aab' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Burr</a> and Pierpont Ed 
wards, who has lately returned from Paris. Perhaps 
he may be the Pennsylvanian of whom you read. 
</p><p>
I can say nothing of election. I have received 
to-day the votes of New Jersey, but know not for 
whom they are, as they are under seal,

The feelings of friendship excite a curiosity to 
know how McKean will vote. By that I shall guess how Governor Adams would have voted. But I have 
seen friendships of S. Quincy, Jonathan Sewall, Daniel Leonard, General Brattle, Treasurer Gray and fifty others go away like a vapor before political winds ; 
and a constant succession of others go the same way 
from that time to this, that I cannot depend upon any 
judgment I can form from any feelings of my own. 
No private friendships would induce me to spare a 
wrong political character. But McKean and Adams 
can never believe the lies that are told. If they could 
vote against me, it must be because they think I 
should not be supple enough to the French. I have 
known the time when both of them would have been 
as stiff as myself. 
</p><p>
I feel myself in a very happy temper of mind ; perfectly willing to be released from the post of danger, 
but determined, if called to it, to brave it, if its horrors were ten times thicker than they are. I have 
but few years of life left, and they cannot be better 
bestowed than upon that independence of my country, in defence of which, that life has ever been in jeopardy.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE prospect that opens upon me presents troubles 
enough of every kind. I have made some inquiry 
concerning horses and carriages and find that a common chariot of the plainest sort cannot be had under 
twelve hundred dollars, and if you go to a little more 
ornament and elegance, you must give fifteen hundred. The President has a pair of horses to sell, one, 
nine, the other, ten years old, for which he asks a 
thousand dollars, and there is no probability of pro 
curing a decent span for less than six hundred dollars. House rent, another indispensable article, will 
be extravagantly high. The plenty of paper has unsettled every thing. Nothing has a price. Every 
one asks and every one cheats as much as he can, I 
think. I wish I knew what would be asked for a 
chariot in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. 
</p><p>
The President says he must sell something to en 
able him to clear out. When a man is about retiring 
from public life, and sees nothing but a ploughshare 
between him and the grave, he naturally thinks most 
upon that. When Charles the fifth resigned his empire and crown, he went to building his coffin. 
When I contemplated a retirement, I meditated the 
purchase of Mrs. Vesey's farm, and thought of building a tomb on my own ground adjoining to the burying yard. The President is now engaged in his speculations upon a vault which he intends to build for 
himself, not to sleep but to lie down in. So you see, 
my little head is made like two great heads, and I 
have ambitiously placed myself between them. Mrs. 
Blodget, who, I dare say, is more desirous that you 
should be Presidente than that I should be President, 
says she is afraid <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>President Washington</a> will not live 
long. I should be afraid too, if I had not confidence 
in his farm and his horse. He must be a fool, I think, 
who dies of chagrin when he has a fine farm and a 
Narraganset mare that paces, trots and canters. But 
I don t know but all men are such fools. I think a 
man had better wear than rust. 
</p><p>
The boyish language of the emissaries from Monroe's academy is not confined to Boston market. 
Captain B is holding the same cant. John Adams must be an intrepid to encounter the open assaults 
of France and the secret plots of England in concert 
with all his treacherous friends and open enemies in 
his own country. Yet I assure you he never felt more serene in his life. 
</p><p>
Yours most tenderly,

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I DINED yesterday with Dr. Rush, who desired me to send the enclosed oration upon a weak democrat 
whom he is pleased to call a great philosopher, astronomer and republican. We must put up with the vagaries of our flighty friend. Mr. and Mrs. Listen, the 
Britons, dined there, the first time I had met the lady. 
They are Scotch, genteel people. Mr. and Mrs. Regal dined there too. Mr. Regal brought a letter, you 
remember, from <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='me'>Mr. Adams</a>. A man of sixty, perhaps, married to a handsome girl of thirty. A man 
of learning, but I presume enthusiastical. He talks 
much of the philosophy of Mr. Kant or Kent, or some 
such name, a German of great fame. He speaks of 
him sometimes very extravagantly. I heard him say that he thought Kant would make a third from Socrates and Jesus Christ. 
</p><p>
Mankind seem to me to have lost their senses. 
</p><p>
I yesterday received yours of the 25th of December. The cold has been as constant and severe as with 
you. I hope you will get wood enough, yet it is uncertain how much will be necessary. Stones cannot 
be sledded in too great numbers. They will not be 
stolen. Have you seen the second " Guillotina" from 
Connecticut, in its usual strain of wicked satire ? 
</p><p>
Neither Virginia nor any other State, except the 
wise Pennsylvania and the wise Georgia, Tennessee, 
and Kentucky, ever intended B. should be Vice. I 
have received one set of votes from each State, and 
the highest number is seventy-one, according to the 
accounts. The votes are all sealed up. 
</p><p>
I say, too, " If thou, O Lord ! go not up with us, 
carry us not up thither."

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
ON Tuesday, when I waited, as usual, on Mrs. Washington, after attending the levee, she congratulated 
me very complaisantly and affectionately on my election, and went farther and said more than I expected. 
She said it gave them great pleasure to find that the 
votes had turned in my favor, &c. I doubted whether 
their prudence would have ventured so far. I believe it sincere. Kidd, however, the steward, was very active and busy for Jefferson. This was from 
jealousy of Briesler, no doubt. He expected that 
Jefferson would have taken him, I suppose, and his 
principle was as good as McKean's. Gerry is 
steady, while so many prove as slippery as eels. 
</p><p>
Dined yesterday with Major Jackson, in company 
with <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague met friend'>General Lincoln</a> who lodges there. Married to 
Miss Willing who is an agreeable woman, and comfortably provided for by an office, he lives in a neat 
and elegant taste, but I believe prudently. Mr. Ames 
and a few more made a very social set, and we en 
joyed ourselves without alloy. 
</p><p>
The most unpleasant part of the prospect before me is 
that of remaining here until June or July. I can t see 
my grass and barley grow, nor my wall rise. I have, 
however, almost forgotten my farm. It appears very 
differently to me. It seems as if I ought not to think 
about it. The river is frozen so that nothing can get 
out. Besides, flour is dearer here than at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> by 
one third. It has rained to-day like a flood, but the 
weather must be very warm, and continue so many 
days before the river can open. There is no probability of it for some time. If it opens in season, I 
shall send some grass seeds. I will not suffer the 
bushes I have cut down to grow again ; but I shall 
not attend much to my farm. My whole time and 
thoughts must be devoted to the public. 
</p><p>
I think of you and dream of you and long to be 
with you. But I suppose this must not be yet. My 
duty and love to all.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
You say Mr. H. is very full of his praises of <a href='/results.php?tla=jam' rel='colleague'>Mr. Monroe</a>. So is Dr. Edwards. He says <a href='/results.php?tla=jam' rel='colleague'>Mr. Monroe</a>'s correspondence will do him infinite honor when 
it comes to be published, and all that. Monroe's house has been a school for scandal against his country, its government and governors, <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a> and his 
treaty, &c. Edwards says, as Dr. Rush told me, 
that Washington's character was in total contempt in 
France. This I shall not believe till I have better 
evidence than that of any or all these great person 
ages ; nay, than all the Directory, Ancients and five 
hundred. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Madison</a></a> is to retire. It seems the mode of becoming great is to retire. Madison, I suppose, after a retirement of a few years, is to be President or 
Vice President. Mr. Cabot, I suppose, after aggrandizing his character in the shade a few years, is to be 
some great thing too ; and Mr. Ames, &c., &c., &c. 
It is marvellous how political plants grow in the shade. 
Continual daylight and sunshine show our faults and 
record them. Our persons, voices, clothes, gait, air, 
sentiments, &c., all become familiar to every eye 
and ear and understanding, and they diminish in pro 
portion, upon the same principle that no man is a hero 
lo his wife or valet de chambre. These gentlemen 
are in the right to run away and hide. Tell Mr. Cabot so if you see him. His countrymen will soon 
believe him to be a giant in a cave, and will go in a 
body and dig him out. I wish, but don t tell Cabot 
so, that they would dig up Gerry. 
</p><p>
I have bespoken a chariot, and am treating for 
horses. We read of a vessel from Rotterdam arrived 
at Lisbon, or its neighborhood, by which I hope there 
may be letters from our young friends, as late as the 
middle of November. My anxiety for letters from 
them increases every day. They have more accurate views and intelligence than any others, and, 
what is of more importance still, more application 
and industry. 
</p><p>
The weather has moderated a little. I am, with 
anxious desires to see you, which I fear cannot be 
gratified before July, 
</p><p>
Yours forever,

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE only time to enclose you something. Dr. Priestley breakfasted with me. I asked him whether 
it was his opinion that the French would ultimately establish a republican government. He said it was, 
and his opinion was founded upon the prophecy. 
France appeared to him to be one of the horns that 
were to fall off. He acknowledged, however, the 
uncertainty, and related a paragraph from a French 
writer who travelled in England immediately before 
the restoration of Charles the second. " That the 
people were much engaged in disputing about a form 
of government, but that all agreed there would never 
be any kings in England again." 
</p><p>
When statesmen found their judgments upon prophecies I can never confide in their opinions.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HOPE you will not communicate to any body the 
hints I give you about our prospects ; but they appear 
every day worse and worse. House rent at twenty- 
seven hundred dollars a year, fifteen hundred dollars 
for a carriage, one thousand for one pair of horses, 
all the glasses, ornaments, kitchen furniture, the best 
chairs, settees, plateaus, &c., all to purchase, all the 
china, delph or wedgewood, glass and crockery of 
every sort to purchase, and not a farthing probably 
will the House of Representatives allow, though the 
Senate have voted a small addition. All the linen 
besides. I shall not pretend to keep more than one 
pair of horses for a carriage, and one for a saddle. 
Secretaries, servants, wood, charities which are demanded as rights, and the million dittoes present such 
a prospect as is enough to disgust any one. Yet not 
one word must we say. 
</p><p>
We cannot go back. We must stand our ground 
as long as we can. Dispose of our places with the 
help of our friend Dr. Tufts, as well as you can. 
We are impatient for news, but that is always so at 
this season.

moderate one, with very moderate furniture.

MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
YOUR dearest friend never had a more trying day 
than yesterday. A solemn scene it was indeed, and 
it was made more affecting to me by the presence of 
the General,whose countenance was as serene and 
unclouded as the day. He seemed to me to enjoy a 
triumph over me. Methought I heard him say, " Ay ! 
I am fairly out and you fairly in ! See which of us 
will be happiest." When the ceremony was over, 
he came and made me a visit, and cordially congratulated me, and wished my administration might be 
happy, successful, and honorable. 
</p><p>
It is now settled that I am to go into his house. It 
is whispered that he intends to take French leave tomorrow. I shall write you as fast as we proceed. 
My chariot is finished, and I made my first appearance in it yesterday. It is simple but elegant enough. 
My horses are young, but clever. 
</p><p>
In the chamber of the House of Representatives 
was a multitude as great as the space could contain, 
and I believe scarcely a dry eye but Washington's. 
The sight of the sun setting full orbed, and another 
rising, though less splendid, was a novelty. Chief 
Justice Ellsworth administered the oath, and with 
great energy. Judges Gushing, Wilson, and Iredell, 
were present. Many ladies. I had not slept well 
the night before, and did not sleep well the night 
after. I was unwell and did not know whether I 
should get through or not. I did, however. How 
the business was received I know not, only I have 
been told that Mason, the treaty publisher, said we 
should lose nothing by the change, for he never heard 
such a speech in public in his life. 
</p><p>
All agree that, taken altogether, it was the sublimest thing ever exhibited in America. I am, my 
dearest friend, most affectionately and kindly yours,

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE no letter this week, and begin to fear that 
your respect to our late President has laid a foundation for a sick spring and summer. Sometimes, too, 
I am jealous of unfair play in the post office to pre 
vent me from hearing from you at the most critical 
period of my life. The public papers must give you 
an account of proceedings which I am wholly unable 
to describe. What judgment is formed of my part 
in the late transactions by my friends or my enemies, 
I know not. There is a reserve in both, beyond my 
comprehension. 
</p><p>
The President and Mrs. Washington go off this 
morning for <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. Yesterday afternoon he 
came to make me his farewell visit, and requested 
me, in his own name and Mrs. W.'s, to present 
" their respects" to <a href='/results.php?tla=aba' rel='spouse met friend'>Mrs. Adams</a>. I believe that I 
envied him more than he did me, and with reason. 
The house is to be cleared and cleaned, and I am 
to go into it on Monday next, if possible. I shall 
make a small establishment for myself, for the present, and wait your advice for ulterior arrangements. 
It is now generally understood that I am to go home 
before midsummer and bring my family in October. 
The business of all kinds, and writing particularly, 
out of the habit of which I have been so long, press 
upon me very severely, and would endanger my 
health, if I did not make conscience of riding every 
day. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Gushing will call upon you, and give you an 
account of what they call the inauguration. It is the 
general report that there was more weeping than 
there has ever been at the representation of any 
tragedy. But whether it was from grief or joy, 
whether from the loss of their beloved President, or 
from the accession of an unbeloved one, or from the 
pleasure of exchanging Presidents without tumult, or 
from the novelty of the thing, or from the sublimity 
of it arising from the multitude present, or whatever 
other cause, I know not. One thing I know, I am a 
being of too much sensibility to act any part well in 
such an exhibition. Perhaps there is little danger of 
my having such another scene to feel or behold. 
</p><p>
The stillness and silence astonishes me. Every 
body talks of the tears, the full eyes, the streaming 
eyes, the trickling eyes, &c., but all is enigma beyond. No one descends to particulars to say why or 
wherefore ; I am, therefore, left to suppose that it is 
all grief for the loss of their beloved. Two or three 
persons have ventured to whisper in my ear that my 
speech made an agreeable impression. I have ventured to say things both in that speech and in my fare 
well address to the Senate, so open to scoffs and sarcasms that I expected them in abundance. I have 
not yet seen any. The more may come. I have 
been so strangely used in this country, so belied and 
so undefended, that I was determined to say some 
things as an appeal to posterity. Foreign nations and 
future times will understand them better than my enemies or friends will own they do. The vanity and 
egotism which is so apparent, or at least to seeming, 
may be pardoned for what I know, lest satirical re 
flections on it, should provoke some one to produce 
proofs that if it is egotism, it is no vanity. 
</p><p>
My dear wife, your society is invaluable to me, 
and yet I cannot enjoy it before July, I fear. All will 
depend upon public events. I shall come to you as 
soon as possible. I am, with an affection that can 
end only with my life, and I hope not then, your 
faithful friend and husband,

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YESTERDAY only I received yours of March 1. I 
am surprised you should have received none from me 
from 11th February. I have written never less than 
once a week, seldom less than twice, and nine weeks 
out of ten three times, ever since I left you. The roads, or some irregularity of the post, must have occasioned your disappointment. I hope you will obtain Mr. Hears, but I must leave every thing to you. 
The load of business that now compels my attention 
every day is such, that I cannot think a moment about 
my farm. Mr. Maund writes me that he has sent 
me a barrel of seed oats, of a superior quality, to 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, by a Captain Allen, who was to sail in the be 
ginning of March from Virginia. The family is gone. 
Mr. Lear and Mr. Dandridge remain, but it is a great 
work to arrange and clean the house. I can t get 
into it before the middle of next week. I hope Billings will sow the barley and grass seed well. What 
will become of my meadow cornfield I know not. 
However, I must leave that and all the rest to you, 
and I could not trust it better. 
</p><p>
My aunt Vesey's death was unknown to me. I am 
very glad you went to the funeral. The feast that 
succeeded was one of those things which are not 
much to my taste. I am glad you went. I went too. 
But these things give offence to the plain people of 
our country upon whose friendship I have always de 
pended. They are practised by the elegant and the 
rich for their own ends, which are not always the 
best. If I could have my wish, there should never 
be a show or a feast made for the President while I 
hold the office. My birthday happens when Congress will never sit, so that I hope it will never be talked of. These are hints, entre nous. I am, my 
dearest friend,

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I AM so constantly engaged in business, most of which 
is new to me, that it seems as if it was impossible to 
find time to write even to you ; yet I believe I write 
every post. 
</p><p>
It proves to be a tedious business to clear the 
President's house for me. I am now told it will 
not be ready this week. You will see by the Gazette how the new Pennsylvania house is disposed of. 
The weather is bad. I have a great cold. The news 
is not pleasant, and I have no society but statesmen. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> has been here and is gone off to-day 
for Virginia. He is as he was, 
</p><p>
I cannot write to you about any thing at home. 
You must do as you judge best. I like all that you 
have proposed to me. I must not write about public 
affairs. I must go to you or you must come to me. 
I cannot live without you till October. But all will 
depend upon events and intelligence to come. My 
regards to the neighbors, duty to my mother, love to 
relations, &c. Oh ! my poor meadow and wall, &c., 
&c., &c. It would do me good like a medicine to 
see Billings one hour at any sort of work.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HOPE to get into the house on Monday next, but 
shall purchase no nice furniture till you come. I 
shall make a little establishment for myself and keep 
bachelors hall for some time. I have procured 
some horses and a carriage, and ride on horseback as 
often as the weather will permit. 
</p><p>
We have no authentic news from Europe. These 
long east winds may bring us something. I sent you 
the last letters from our sons dated about the middle 
of December. Mr. Murray is to go to Holland arid 
Mr. Dandridge as his secretary, so that Thomas will 
come home directly, I hope. I would not even ad 
vise him to go to France. I hope to have one of my 
children near me. It would have given me great 
pleasure to have had some ( f my family present at my 
inauguration, which was the most affecting and over 
powering scene I ever acted in. I was very unwell, 
had no sleep the night before, and really did not know 
but I should have fainted in presence of all the world, 
I was in great doubt whether to say any thing or not 
besides repeating the oath. And now, the world is 
as silent as the grave. All the federalists seem to be 
afraid to approve any body but Washington. The 
Jacobin papers damn with faint praise, and undermine 
with misrepresentation and insinuation. If the federalists go to playing pranks, I will resign the office, 
and let Jefferson lead them to peace, wealth and power if he will. 
</p><p>
From the situation where I now am, I see a scene 
of ambition beyond all my former suspicions or imaginations ; an emulation which will turn our government topsy-turvy. Jealousies and rivalries have been 
my theme, and checks and balances as their antidotes 
till I am ashamed to repeat the words ; but they 
never stared me in the face in such horrid forms as 
at present. I see how the thing is going. At the 
next election England will set up Jay or Hamilton, 
and France, Jefferson, and all the corruption of Po 
land will be introduced ; unless the American spirit 
should rise and say, we will have neither John Bull nor 
Louis Baboon. 
</p><p>
Silence.

MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
THIS day you promised me to begin your journey ; 
but if the weather is as disagreeable with you as it is 
here, I could not exact the fulfilment of the engagement. I fear you will have bad roads and unpleasant weather. You talk of your perplexities and say 
you must get out of them yourself. Do you think 
mine less severe, public or private ? 
</p><p>
My dear and venerable mother! alas, I feel for 
her. She can compliment her daughter yet that 
is a good sign. As to the husband, it seems to me 
that the mother and the daughter ought to think a little of the president as well as the husband. His 
cares! his anxieties ! his health ? Don t laugh. His 
comfort ; that his head may be clear and his heart 
firm, ought to be thought on more than the husband. 
Provide every thing for my aged and worthy mother. 
I hope to see her yet again before October. 
</p><p>
You, and such petit maitres and maitresses as you, 
are forever criticising the periods and diction of such 
great men as presidents and chief justices. Do you 
think their minds are taken up with such trifles ? 
There is solid, keen, deep sense in that morsel of Ellsworth's. You ought to be punished for wishing it 
not published. 
I warrant you, I shall soon be acquitted of the crime 
of Chronicle, Argus and Aurora praise. Let it run 
its rig, however, and say nothing at present. Your 
moral reflections on worldly possessions and earthly 
comforts, your look into futurity for brighter scenes 
and fairer prospects, are wise. 
</p><p>
You can t imagine what a man of business I am. 
How many papers I read and how much I write every 
day. I fear you will effeminate me when you come. 
I have determined to send my coachman and horses 
to Paul us Hook for you. As soon as I know the day 
you will be ready to get your coach over to the hook, 
I will endeavor to contrive that the horses shall be 
ready to be harnessed at your command. You will 
find the coachman very attentive, sober, skilful and obliging. 
</p><p>
I am forever your

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YOUR letters of the 21,22, 23, and 26th of April, are 
all before me. They have inspired me with all the 
melancholy in which they were written. Our mother and our niece are gone to rest. The first a fruitfully 
ripe, the last but a blossom or a bud. I have suffered 
for you as much as you have suffered, but I could 
give you no aid, or amusement, or comfort. I pray 
God that these dispensations may be for our good. 
My mother's countenance and conversation was a 
source of enjoyment to me that is now dried up for 
ever, at <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>. Our ancestors are now all gone, 
and we are to follow them very soon to a country 
where there will be no war or rumor of war, no envy, 
jealousy, rivalry, or party. 
</p><p>
You and I are now entering on a new scene, which 
will be the most difficult and least agreeable of any 
in our lives. I hope the burden will be lighter lo 
both of us, when we come together. 
</p><p>
I am, as long as life lasts, your ever affectionate

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE received yours of the 18th, and none later. 
Your company here is much desired by every body, 
but by none so much as me. My occupation in business is so incessant that I could have little time to 
pass with you, but that little every day would be precious and invaluable. You express a willingness to 
come on ; but the thought of attempting it without 
consulting your friends and physicians distresses and 
terrifies me lest it should prove fatal to a life that is 
dear to me beyond all expression. If, however, your 
physicians are of opinion that you can come on by 
easy journeys, in any way you can think of, your arrival here will be an inexpressible satisfaction to me. 
But if you attempt to come without a fixed resolution to take care of your health and renounce those 
fatigues of public places, drawing rooms, great dinners, &c., I am very apprehensive that this winter 
will be your last. A constitution so wrecked and 
exhausted as yours has been by a three months confinement, may be easily overset 
</p><p>
We are all well and every thing goes on very well. 
We had the ministry and general officers to dine on 
Monday, and all agreeable. 
</p><p>
I am, with tenderness inexpressible, ever yours,

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YOUR letters of November 29, December 2 and 3, 
affect me very tenderly. The low spirits, effects of 
long and exhausting sickness are apparent ; but these are evils of a serious nature. I pray you to banish 
as much as possible all gloomy thoughts, and be very cautious to avoid every thing which may endanger a return of your old disorders. 
</p><p>
To reconcile you to your fate, I have a great mind 
to give you a detail of mine. A peck of troubles iu 
a large bundle of papers, often in a hand-writing 
almost illegible, comes every day from the office of 
</p><p>
, office of , office of , &c., &c., &c. 
</p><p>
Thousands of sea letters, Mediterranean passes, and 
commissions and patents to sign; no company no 
society idle, unmeaning ceremony, follies, extravagance, shiftlessness, and health sinking, for what I 
know, under my troubles and fatigues. You and I 
seem to have arrived prematurely at the age when 
there is no pleasure. 
</p><p>
All this is not the resignation of Socrates. 
</p><p>
I cannot encourage the idea of your coming on to 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. The horrid roads, and cold, damp 
weather, would put an end to you. I hope our dear 
son will arrive and cheer you up.

I am, with unalterable affection,

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I RECEIVED to-day your favor of the 24th, and it 
made the day more tolerable. Your health and spirits 
always promote mine. 
</p><p>
We have had more company to-day than ever upon 
any occasion. Thirty or forty gallons of punch, wine 
in proportion and cake in abundance. The news by 
the America, Captain Jenkins, arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=newburyport' rel='city'>Newburyport</a>, made every body gay but me. Not a word of 
T. B. A. I shall be uneasy till I hear further. He 
could not be so imprudent as to omit that opportunity. 
</p><p>
You have an admirable faculty of employing your mind, and in the affairs of the farm, materials for it. 
I want my talkative wife, but fear, if she should attempt to come here, she would not talk farther than 
Worcester or Springfield. But my wife was too studious and addicted to scribbling, to talk much to me when she was here. 
</p><p>
Our people grow amazingly fearless and valiant in 
proportion as they hear the English beat the French ; 
and that formidable combinations are forming against 
them by Turkey, Russia, Austria, and England. I 
don t like this bravery which grows in proportion as 
danger appears to lessen. I like that fortitude which 
increases as danger grows, in a good cause. The 
English have exhibited an amazing example of skill 
and intrepidity, perseverance and firmness at sea. 
We are a chip of that block, and we could do as we 
pleased, at least as we ought, upon the watery element, 
if it were not that we shall excite jealousy in the 
English navy. We must, however, stand for our 
right. We must adopt their motto, " Dieu et mon droit." 
</p><p>

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I AM as much of a solitudinarian as Frederick the 
Conqueror. He was constantly saying at sixty, " Jesuis vieux, casse, surannee," &c., &c., &c. I may 
say the same and have the honor to resemble him in 
this particular, but I shall never imitate his idolatry 
for Voltaire. His materialism appears to me very 
superficial. He insists upon being all matter, without 
knowing what matter is. The monades, the etres 
simples, the atoms, the molecules organiques, all 
these guesses and fictions, are as nonsensical as the 
occult qualities. Human knowledge cannot penetrate 
so deep. I was profoundly learned in all that jargon 
at twenty years of age, but found it all useless, and 
renounced it for fee simple and fee tail. 
</p><p>
Thomas is my delight and I know not how to re 
sign him ; but as I know you will not be quite well 
till you see him, I shall consent to his going next 
week.

TO HIS DEAREST FRIEND : 
</p><p>
YOURS of 25th ult. is received. Thomas is to set off 
from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to-day for <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>, and I wish him a 
pleasant journey, which the fine weather and convenient snow promises. A happy sight of his friends 
will come of course without accidents. He found his 
father forty years older than when he left him, and if 
he finds his mother advanced only ten, it may be an 
agreeable disappointment to him. But if we should 
live ten years longer, I suppose we shall begin, like 
the hero of Prussia, to think ourselves young, at 
least not old. I rejoice that President Willard is re 
stored to his family, friends, and the public. Mr. Gerry has seen the communication and the annotations. I should be glad to know the public opinion of 
both. I shall not commit to writing any remarks 
upon the conduct of such great men as ministers of 
state and ambassadors. I agree with you that voluble old women or handsome young ones are the best 
ambassadors to some courts and governments. I wish 
some power or other would send you to me in the 
first character. 
</p><p>
Tell Mr. Porter that I wish to have the best manure upon the hill, and enough of it to give the land 
a good dressing.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I WENT last night to the ball, where the company suffered more by the cold, which was excessive, than I ever 
knew any company suffer in my life. The dancers 
only were comfortable. I came home and went into 
a warm bed and had a fine perspiration, occasioned, 
I believe, by my drinking three glasses of Madeira 
wine at supper, and. two more after I came home, 
which has relieved me from all cold and I feel very 
well this morning. The company, owing to the 
weather, was not large. 
</p><p>
I am very anxious to hear from you, having no letter since the 10th. Your sickness last summer, fall, 
and winter, has been to me the severest trial I ever 
endured. Not that I am at this moment without 
other trials enough for one man. I may adopt the 
words of a celebrated statesman, whom, however, I 
should not wish to resemble in many things : " And 
now, good judge," says he, " let me ask you whether 
you believe that my situation in the world is perfectly as I could wish it ; whether you imagine that I 
meet with no shock from my superiors, no perverseness from my equals, no impertinence from my inferiors ? If you fancy me in such a state of bliss 
you are wide from the mark." 
</p><p>
I have planned out so much work for myself that 
I shall not be able to go eastward till some time after 
the rising of Congress. But every day will seem 
long. I am, my dearest friend, 
</p><p>
Yours forever,

MY DEAREST FRIEND.

I AM favored this morning with yours of the 22d. 
This is accession day, you know. I shall always 
consider it as a red letter day ; a fortunate day. I am happy to know that you are comfortably situated. 
I am pretty well recovered of my cold, but it has reduced my flesh. James has found a beautiful pair 
of black horses, a perfect match for ours, and is distracted to persuade me to buy them. One is six 
years old, the other eight. I think with you that the 
second week in November will be soon enough for 
us to enter the city. I am looking out for Briesler now 
every day. You alone might possibly live here with 
me for a week ; but L. and B. could not be accommodated. You might all be well at Van Tilsburg's, 
but I think it will not be worth your while to leave 
your present situation. When Briesler comes on I 
shall write you more particularly. 
</p><p>
The next winter will be the last we shall ever 
spend in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. You will leave it early in 
April if you are wise, and you will come no more to 
the southward for one year and a half at least. You 
will never think of going to <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> upon uncertainties, or rather upon the certainty of leaving it 
on the fourth of March, with five hundred and fifty 
or six hundred miles to ride through the mud. An 
election is approaching which will set us at liberty 
from these uncomfortable journeys, I am, as for 
thirty-five years I have been,

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE received yours of 24th, and thank you for 
your relation of our little domestic affairs at <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>. 
Briesler did not arrive last night, as you calculated. 
His children may detain him longer than you expected. Some of the public offices are about re 
moving to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> this week. I can send James 
with my horses and chariot to meet you at Hoboken 
ferry or <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a>, or any other place you may 
appoint, and at any time you will appoint, if you can 
be sure of your plans and measures. 
</p><p>
I have been, forenoon and afternoon, to church to 
hear Parson Waddell, who gave us two discourses 
good and wholesome for soul, body, and estate. He 
is a good picture of " stalled theology," and is said to 
have a good estate. Last Sunday I went to the Presbyterian church and heard Mr. Grant, an ingenious 
young gentleman. There is something more cheerful and comfortable in an Episcopalian than in a 
Presbyterian church. I admire a great part of the 
Divine service at church very much. It is very humane and benevolent, and sometimes pathetic and 
affecting, but rarely gloomy, if ever. Their creeds 
I could dispense with very well, because the Scriptures being before us contain the creed the most certainly orthodox. But you know I never write nor 
talk upon divinity. I have had more than I could do 
of humanity. Benevolence and beneficence, indus 
try, equity and humanity, resignation and submission, 
repentance and reformation, are the essence of my 
religion. Alas ! how weakly and imperfectly have I 
fulfilled the duties of my own religion ! I look back 
upon a long life very poorly spent in my own estimation. Busy as it has appeared to some, to me it ap 
pears to have been very much too idle, inactive, 
slothful, and sluggish. I fear it is too late to amend. 
My forces are far spent, and by too much exertion I. should soon exhaust them all. I am not in the 
vapors, but in very good spirits, notwithstanding this 
penitent confession of my faults.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I RECEIVED your favor of the 2d by Mr. Dexter, and 
this morning from Mr. Gerry an account of your 
health on the 4th, which have relieved me from some 
anxiety, as I had received no letter from you since 
you were in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
I have seen many cities and fine places since you 
left me, and particularly <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. Mrs. 
Washington and her whole family very kindly inquired after your health and all your children, and 
sent many friendly greetings. I like the seat of government very well, and shall sleep or lie awake next 
winter in the President's house. I have slept very 
well on my journey, and been pretty well. An abundance of company and many tokens of respect have 
attended my journey, and my visit here is well received. Mr. Marshall and Mr. Dexter lodge with me 
at Tunnicliff's City Hotel, very near the capitol. The 
establishment of the public offices in this place has 
given it the air of the seat of government, and all 
things seem to go on well. 
</p><p>
I am particularly pleased with <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a>. Mr. Lee lives very elegantly, neatly and agreeably there, 
among his sisters and friends, and among his fine

WE arrived here last night, or rather yesterday, at 
one o clock, and here we dined and slept. The 
building is in a state to be habitable, and now we 
wish for your company. The account you give of 
the melancholy state of our dear brother Mr. Cranch 
and his family, is really distressing, and must severely 
afflict you. I most cordially sympathize with you 
and them. 
</p><p>
I have seen only Mr. Marshall and Mr. Stoddert, 
General Wilkinson and the two commissioners, Mr. Scott and Mr. Thornton. I shall say nothing of public 
affairs. I am very glad you consented to come on, 
for you would have been more anxious at <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a> 
than here, and I, to all my other solicitudines mordaces, as Horace calls them, i. e., " biting cares," 
should have added a great deal on your account. 
Besides, it is fit and proper that you and I should re 
tire together, and not one before the other. Before I 
end my letter, I pray heaven to bestow the best of 
blessings on this house, and on all that shall hereafter 
inhabit it. May none but honest and wise men ever 
rule under this roof ! I shall not attempt a description of it. You will form the best idea of it from inspection. 
Mr. Briesler is very anxious for the arrival of the 
man and women, and I am much more so for that of 
the ladies. I am, with unabated confidence and affection, your

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
SATURDAY night, nine o clock, and not before, I received yours of 13th, and the letter to Thomas with 
it, brought here no doubt by mistake. I regret very 
much that you have not a gentleman with you. The 
skittish young colt with you is always timorous, but 
no harm will befall you or her, I trust. The weather 
and roads here on Saturday, Sunday, and to-day, are 
the finest we have seen this year. 
</p><p>
The election will be decided this day in favor of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, as it is given out by good authority. 
</p><p>
The burden upon me in nominating judges and 
consuls and other officers, in delivering over the furniture, in the ordinary business at the close of a session, 
and in preparing for my journey of five hundred miles through the mire, is and will be very heavy. 
My time will be all taken up. I pray you to continue to write me. My anxiety for you is a very distressing addition to all my other labors. 
</p><p>
Our bishop gave us a good discourse yesterday, 
and every body inquired after you. I was able to 
tell them you had arrived on Friday night at Baltimore. I sleep the better for having the shutters open, 
and all goes on well. I pray God to bless and pre 
serve you.

I give a feast to-day to Indian kings and aristocrats.
