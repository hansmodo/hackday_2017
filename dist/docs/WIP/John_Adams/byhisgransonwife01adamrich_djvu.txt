PREFACE. 

Vfi 

c* 

THE publication of a number of letters by 

the wife of John Adams, which had been ad- 
c dressed to him as well as to others, is understood 
^ to have excited some curiosity to see his replies. 
v Apart from the general and natural desire to 
o" read both parts of any interesting correspond 
ence, a wish has been expressed by some per 
il^ sons to the Editor, that the mode and degree in 
^ which the affection and sensibility of the lady 
~ were returned should be shown. Intimations 
have even been made that she has been pre 
sented in a favorable light samewhat at the ex 
pense of her husband, and that something should 
be done to restore his reputation as well in his 
public as in his domestic relations. Although 
the Editor can scarcely be expected to admit 
that any apprehensions of this, kind are well 
founded, he knows of no reason why the letters 
themselves should be withheld from publica- 



Yl PREFACE. 

lion, let the desire to see them proceed from what 
motive it may. Notwithstanding that they 
were in their nature private and confidential, 
they differ very little in their general charac 
ter and tone from those papers of Mr. Adams, 
which have been long before the world. As 
there was little that was artificial about him 
in his life time, there is no danger that his 
most secret communications will be at vari 
ance with his declared opinions, or that for 
this reason alone it is desirable that anything 
should be suppressed. The volumes now pub 
lished contain a very full selection from the let 
ters addressed by him to Mrs. Adams, during 
the period of twenty-five years, in which long 
and frequent separations from her were the 
consequence of his public duties. 

In submitting these papers to the public, it is 
not deemed necessary to prefix any biographi 
cal notice of the writer. Such a work has been 
long expected from far more experienced and 
skilful hands than those of the Editor, and may 
yet be executed. The present undertaking is 
designed in no way to interfere with that, or to 
be other than, perhaps, an incidental aid to its 
accomplishment. As a public man, the leading 



PREFACE. Vll 

events in the life of Mr. Adams are already too 
well known to require explanation. But wher 
ever it has been thought that information might 
prove useful to the reader, which was not al 
ready indirectly supplied by the Memoir of Mrs. 
Adams, it has been conveyed in the form of 
notes at the foot of the page. Such references 
to various historical works, in which the events 
and persons here casually mentioned are more 
fully described, have been added, as may facili 
tate the researches of the curious. To the labors 
of no single individual in this department of 
knowledge are they already more indebted than 
to those of Professor Sparks. No one who has 
ever had occasion to examine the mass of papers 
relating to the revolution can fail to appreciate 
the extent of patient and minute investigation 
that must have been necessary to establish facts 
and dates in such a manner that the results 
may be relied upon with tolerable certainty by 
subsequent generations. The Editor is the 
more anxious to acknowledge the great aid he 
has derived from this gentleman in the particu 
lars specified, as he finds himself very fre 
quently compelled, whenever the application of 
general principles to the facts so carefully de- 



Till PREFACE. 

tailed is involved, to dissent from the conclu 
sions which he has drawn. 

It can scarcely he supposed that the letters 
of Mr. Adams will prove quite as attractive to 
the public as those of his wife which have been 
published, or that they will equally amuse pre 
cisely the same class of readers. There is less 
of novelty about them and less of that species 
of sentiment which appeals at once to the heart 
of numbers of both sexes. Yet if it be a recom 
mendation to letters that they are exponents of 
personal character, these may be not wholly 
without interest Moreover, the tone and spirit 
which run through them will not be found upon 
a level at all beneath that which prevails in 
Mrs. Adams s productions. Very early in the 
period of the Editor s labor a grave question 
sprung up for his decision, how far he had a 
right to use his judgment in altering or omitting 
such portions of these papers as might for vari 
ous reasons appear to him to be unsuitable for 
publication. The difficulty seemed much more 
serious in the present case than it had done 
in preparing the letters of Mrs. Adams, because 
the opinions and acts of Mr. Adams were those 
of a leading historical character, and therefore

necessarily bore a more extensive influence upon 
a much larger circle of cotemporaries than hers 
could be expected to do. There were some 
passages which, although well enough when 
considered as written in the careless way of 
confidential correspondence, yet looked too tri 
fling for a grave character when publication was 
in question. Others presented him as holding 
opinions upon various subjects which clash 
with the fashionable sentiments of the present 
day and with the prevailing political dogmas 
of the sovereign majority in the United States. 
And still others contain reflections upon indi 
viduals which might by possibility and not 
withstanding that all the parties have been 
long removed from the scene, offend the feel 
ings of sensitive descendants or friends. These 
considerations pressed the Editor very strongly 
to a thorough revision of the letters, to pro 
ceed in which he could feel himself the more 
justified by the idea that as they had not origi 
nally been designed for publication, he should 
in so doing only be executing what the writer 
himself would have done if he could have fore 
seen the use that was now about to be made of 
them. Yet, however strong these arguments 



X PREPACK. 



appeared, obstacles of a very serious character 
presented themselves to the performance of the 
duty which they recommended. In the first 
place, it is a matter of doubt to the Editor how far 
any person, by virtue of a self-constituted office, 
has a right to alter and modify the language of 
another so as to make him appear before the 
public as saying more or less than he really 
thought Secondly, admitting such a right to 
exist in its full extent, the exercise of it, to any 
great degree, appears to be of questionable expe 
diency. For however it may effect the intro 
duction of a tolerable share of uniformity in 
literature, this benefit can be gained only at the 
expense of all its vitality. The evils attending 
it appear to be of two kinds. The first, that it 
inevitably makes the character and opinions of 
an Editor the standard for judging those of the 
writer, and thus confounds all ability to discrim 
inate bet ween them. The second, that it tempts 
him to too great subserviency to the popular doc 
trines of the existing generation at the hazard 
of sacrificing what may after all be truth. If 
there is one recommendation to a literary work 
more than any other to be prized, it is that 
it should present the miud of the writer in as 



PREFACE. XI 

distinct a shape and as free from all extrin 
sic modeling as possible. The varieties that 
exist among mankind in temper, disposition prin 
ciples and affections, are so infinite, that wher 
ever such do not appear in books professing to 
describe individuals, the inference is almost 
irresistible that some attempt or other has been 
made to obliterate those marks by which the 
difference between them is made visible to all. 
Having given to these opposing suggestions 
all the consideration which they appeared to 
deserve, the Editor at last determined to adhere 
closely to the text before him, never varying 
from it by alteration, and doing so by omission 
only when the case was of such obvious neces 
sity, from the nature of the subject treated, as to 
make it an imperative duty. In practising 
under this rule, the consequences may be, that 
he has retained many details so trivial that they 
would have been better omitted, as notices of 
the weather, of the writer s health, of his child 
ren, of his barber, &c. &&amp;lt;:., and that he may be 
thought not to have properly lopped the bold 
ness of expression of which Mr. Adams was 
often guilty, when, to borrow his own applica 
tion of the phrase of James Otis, " the zeal pot 



Xll PREFACE. 

boiled over." For errors of judgment, if such 
have been committed, his only apology is to be 
found in a perhaps over earnest desire to retain 
the characteristic features of his author in all 
their freshness. At no time of his life was John 
Adams a man of many concealments. It would 
therefore be strange affectation in any of his 
descendants now to strive to make him appear 
other than he was or to dilute his strength with 
a portion of their weakness. There was no 
hypocrisy in him whilst alive and it would 
scarcely be doing him justice to invest him 
with a share of it after his death. His charac 
ter and that of his compeers must go down to 
be judged by posterity, with whom there is no 
chance of the fear or favor that affects the ver 
dicts of cotemporary generations. To that ul 
timate tribunal the Editor is willing to submit 
what evidence passes through his hands with 
out making any puny effort of his own to influ 
ence the decision. 

The great recommendation of this correspond 
ence, in a historical point of view, is that, as 
connected with the period of which it treats, 
it is probably unique. Nothing of the same 
kind has thus far appeared from any quarter, 



PREFACE. Xlll 

much less from persons so actively interested in 
the management of affairs. The letters of Gen 
eral Washington to his wife were all, with a 
single trifling exception, destroyed by her a short 
time before her decease, and her own, if she 
ever wrote many, probably shared the same 
fate. Mr. Jefferson lost his wife early, and very 
little allusion to her is found among his pub 
lished papers. Other distinguished persons, 
though of less note, may have written and 
probably did write letters which would now 
be very interesting if they had been saved from 
destruction; but as none such have yet been 
published, it is to be feared that they have per 
ished. America is not the place for preservation 
of papers in the hands of families. The modes of 
life are too migratory, and the means of subsist 
ence too precarious to be favorable to this ob 
ject. For this reason is it, that the domestic 
feelings of the revolution are already rapidly 
eluding the grasp of investigators. The de 
cline of day is the signal for all great objects 
to throw long shadows, perplexing to just ideas 
of proportion, and preparatory to a general and 
dusky twilight. We are beginning to forget that 
the patriots of former days were men like our- 



PREFACE. 

selves, acting and acted upon like the present 
race, and we are almost irresistibly led to ascribe 
to them in our imaginations certain gigantic pro 
portions and superhuman qualities, without re 
flecting that this at once robs their characters of 
consistency and their virtues of all merit It 
is imitating the conduct of those poets and ro 
mancers who laud their heroes for courage 
after having made them invu.nerable. Fancy 
may do what it pleases as its purpose is only to 
amuse, but history has a nobler object The 
veneration which attaches to great men should 
not be barren of all emulation in those who 
feel it The present race of Americans may 
not be called to make precisely the same exer 
tions in the field that were made by their pre 
decessors, but it will be subjected to internal 
struggles perhaps even more violent than theirs. 
Struggles, success in which makes the glory 
that distinguishes the patriot from the dema 
gogue, and the attaining a victory in which 
renders the path of rectitude and of honor 
equally hard to tread in every age and under 
every clime. 

The letters of Mr. Adams will be found to 
differ in many particulars from those of his wife. 



PREFACE. XV 

They are generally shorter, more desultory, and 
written in more sententious paragraphs. There 
is, besides, a spice of humor about them which 
is never perceived in hers. Occasionally two 
and even three separate sheets of paper were 
used on the same day, which might have justi 
fied the Editor in regarding them as making 
but one letter and moulding them into one form, 
had he not preferred exactly to follow the manu 
scripts. The celebrated letters of the 3d of 
July, 1776, have been already treated by some 
one else in that manner, and it may be thought 
that the effect of them is injured by reestab 
lishing the shape in which they were origin 
ally written. It was not deemed advisable in 
that instance to depart from the general rule 
which had been applied to all of the unpub 
lished letters. The great object has been to 
mark the character of the writer through a me 
dium purely of his own making. This may 
take off a little, it is true, from his reputation 
of exact prediction in the case in question, but 
it has a counterbalancing advantage in restor 
ing the characteristic tone of familiar letters to 
what had been made to look a little like studied 
declamation. Had Mr. Adams, when address- 



+ PREFACE. 

V 

ing letters to his wife, been in the practice of 
formal essay writing, he would doubtless have 
combined and concentrated his thoughts in a me 
thodical and sustained style. This might have 
been very good in itself, but would have been 
out of place when considered as the style of 
familiar letters. It is the disjointed, irregu 
lar chat, now relating the most trivial inci- 
/ dents of common life, and now rising with 
the subject treated into lofty speculation, yet 
dwelling long upon nothing, which consti 
tutes their peculiar recommendation. No 
reader can fail to understand at once, that the 
writer was in the midst of occupations of a 
public nature, from which he could only now 
and then snatch a few moments to give loose to 
his meditative humor. This must explain the 
cause why the letters are so short, and why 
many, which at first sight would appear from 
their brevity and want of importance scarcely 
to merit a place in the collection, have been in 
troduced. It is believed that even these will 
be found to have some bearing upon the gene 
ral character of the correspondence. For if the 
object in publishing letters is to place in strong 
relief the individual who writes them, it surely 



\ 

PREFACE. . XVII 

is of almost as great importance to put in the 
small traits as the great ones. 

It will be perceived that the published cor 
respondence has been carried down to the very 
last date in the collection, including a consider 
able number written during the stormy period 
of twelve years that the federal party was in 
the ascendant. By inserting these letters, the 
editor has had no wish or design to awaken 
animosities or revive party prejudices. He did 
not hold it at all inconsistent with such a pro 
fession to admit many strong expressions of in 
dividual sentiment upon the political questions 
of a period long since passed away, which can 
have no bearing whatever upon persons or par 
ties in the present day. Mr. Adams s opinions 
upon government were his own. There was a 
time when they were much misrepresented for 
the sake of producing temporary political ef 
fects. That time is passed, and no reason now 
exists why they should not be fairly judged from 
his own explanations of them. They are not 
probably much more in imisohi with the pre 
vailing sentiments in the United States at this 
time, than when they were first written, but they 
had been maturely formed, and were sincerely

held, and there is no reason why they should not 
be fairly declared. Their ultimate correctness 
remains to be tested by experience. Servility to 
popular opinion, merely because it was the judg 
ment of the majority, was never the character 
istic of Mr. Adams, nor is it the desire of his de 
scendant now to try to build up any fame for him 
upon that foundation. The editor has not made 
his selection simply upon the ground of inserting 
whatever might be perfectly in accordance with 
the convictions of others or his own. Such a 
principle of action would seem entirely destruc 
tive of all individuality of character in families. 
His object has been to prepare an amusing, and 
it is hoped at the same time, a not wholly un- 
instructive compilation, divested of all material 
which might be deemed just cause of offence 
to any one, and yet retaining a sufficiently 
marked character, to fix the attention of gen 
eral readers. And this has been done, it is 
proper to add, solely by himself, upon his own 
responsibility, without advice or consultation 
with any person. 

With these volumes as embracing not all that 
could be furnished, but as much as the public 
is desirous to see, the editor proposes to finish 



PREFACE. XIX 

his labors. It is, however, due to the descend 
ants of Mrs. "Warren, of Plymouth, and of Mrs. 
Norton, the niece of Mrs. Adams, to acknow 
ledge their great kindness in furnishing him 
with copies of many interesting letters, and 
with liberty to use them whenever he should 
deem it advisable. It is not his intention to 
abuse the indulgent favor, already granted by 
the public, in pressing upon them letters to 
satiety, or he should have availed himself of 
their permission at once.

gave me of the return of your disorder. I fear you

it, and have the pleasure to think I have had some 
success. I rise at five, walk three miles, keep the

4 LETTERS. 

We live, my dear soul, in an age of trial. What 
will be the consequence, I know not The town of 
Boston, for aught 1 can see, must suffer martyrdom. 
It must expire. And our principal consolation is, that 
it dies in a noble cause the cause of truth, of virtue, 
of liberty and of humanity, and that it will probably 
have a glorious resurrection to greater wealth, splen- J 
dor and power than ever. 

Let me know what is best for us to do. It is ex 
pensive keeping a family here, and there is no pros 
pect of any business in my way in this town this 
whole summer. I don t receive a shilling a week. 
We must contrive as many ways as we can to save 
expenses ; for we may have calls to contribute very 
largely, in proportion to our circumstances, to prevent 
other very honest worthy people from suffering for 
want, besides our own loss in point of business and 
profit 

Don t imagine from all this that I am in the dumps. 
Far otherwise. I can truly say, that I have felt more 
spirits and activity since the arrival of this news than 
I had done before for years. I look upon this as the 
last effort of Lord North s despair, and he will as sure 
ly be defeated in it, as he was in the project of the tea. 
I am, with great anxiety for your health,

LETTERS. O 

LETTER IT. 

York, 1 29 June, 1774. 

MY DEAR, 

I HAVE a great deal of leisure, which I chiefly em 
ploy in scribbling, that my mind may not stand still 
or run back, like my fortune. There is very little 
business hero, and David Scwall, David Wyer, John 
Sullivan and James Sullivan and Theophilus Bradbury 
are the lawyers who attend the inferior courts, and 
consequently, conduct the causes at the superior. 

I find that the country is the situation to make es 
tates by the law. John Sullivan, who is placed at Dur 
ham in New Hampshire, is younger both in years and 
practice than I am. He began with nothing, but is 
now said to be worth ten thousand pounds lawful 
money, his brother James allows five or six or per 
haps seven thousand pounds, consisting in houses and 
lands, notes, bonds and mortgages. He has a fine 
stream of water with an excellent corn mill, saw mill, 
fulling mill, scythe mill and others, in all, six mills, 
which are both his delight and his profit. As he has 
earned cash in his business at the bar, he has taken 
opportunities to purchase farms of his neighbours, who 
wanted to sell and move out farther into the woods, at 
an advantageous rate, and in this way has been grow 
ing rich ; under the smiles and auspices of Governor 

1 Mr. Adams was riding the circuit of the Court according 
to the practice of lawyers at this time. 



6 LETTERS. 

Went worth, he has been promoted in the civil and mil 
itary way, so that he is treated with great respect in 
this neighbourhood. 

James Sullivan, brother of the other, who studied 
law under him, without any academical education 
(and John was in the same case), is fixed at Saco, alias 
Biddeford, in our province. He began with neither 
learning, books, estate nor anything but his head and 
hands, and is now a very popular lawyer and growing 
rich very fast, purchasing great farms, &c., and a justice 
of the peace and a member of the General Court. 

David Sewall, of this town, never practises out 
of this county ; has no children ; has no ambition nor 
avarice, they say, (however quaere.) His business 
in this county maintains him very handsomely, and 
he gets beforehand. 

Bradbury at Falmouth, they say, grows rich very 
fast. 

I was first sworn in 1758. My life has been a con 
tinual scene of fatigue, vexation, labour and anxiety. 
I have four children. I had a pretty estate from my 
father; I have been assisted by your father; I 
have done the greatest business in the province ; I 
have had the very richest clients in the province. 
Yet I am poor, in comparison with others. 

This, I confess, is grievous and discouraging. I 
ought however to be candid enough to acknowledge 
that I have been imprudent I have spent an estate 
in books ; I have spent a sum of money indiscreetly 
in a lighter, another in a pew, and a much greater in 
a house in Boston. These would have been indis- 



LETTERS. 7 

cretions, if the impeachment of the Judges, the Bos 
ton port bill, &c. &c., had never happened ; but by 
the unfortunate interruption of my business from 
these causes, those indiscretions became almost fatal 
to me ; to be sure, much more detrimental. 

John Lowell, at Newburyport, has built himself a 
house like the palace of a nobleman, and lives in 
great splendor. His business is very profitable. In 
short, every lawyer who has the least appearance of 
abilities, makes it do in the country. In town, nobody 
does, or ever can, who either is not obstinately deter 
mined never to have any connexion with politics, or 
does not engage on the side of the Government, the 
Administration and the Court. 

Let us, therefore, my dear partner, from that affec 
tion which we feel for our lovely babes, apply our 
selves, by every way we can, to the cultivation of our 
farm. Let frugality and industry be our virtues, if 
they are not of any others. And above all cares of 
this life, let our ardent anxiety be, to mould the minds 
and manners of our children. Let us teach them not 
only to do virtuously, but to excel. To excel, they 
must be taught to be steady, active and industrious. 
I am, &c. Your 

JOHN ADAMS.

LETTER III. 

Falmouth, 6 July, 1774 

MOBS are the trite topic of declamation and in 
vective among all the ministerial people far and near. 
They are grown universally learned in the nature, 
tendency and consequences of them, and very ele 
gant and pathetic in descanting upon them. They 
are sources of all kinds of evils, vices and crimes, they 
say. They give rise to profaneness, intemperance, 
thefts, robberies, murders, and treason. Cursing, 
swearing, drunkenness, gluttony, lewdness, trespasses, 
maims are necessarily involved in them and occasion 
ed by them. Besides, they render the populace, the 
rabble, the scum of the earth, insolent and disorderly, 
impudent and abusive. They give rise to lying, 
hypocrisy, chicanery and even perjury among the 
people, who are driven to such artifices and crimes, 
to conceal themselves and their companions from 
prosecutions in consequence of them. 

This is the picture drawn by the Tory pencil; 
and it must be granted to be a likeness. But this is 
declamation. What consequence is to be drawn from 
this description ? Shall we submit to parliamentary 
taxation, to avoid mobs? Will not parliamentary 
taxation, if established, occasion vices, crimes and 
follies, infinitely moie numerous, dangerous and

this period apart of the province of Massachusetts Bay. 



LETTERS. 9 

falal to the community? Will not parliamentary 
taxation, if established, raise a revenue unjustly and 
wrongfully ? If this revenue is scattered by the hand 
of corruption among the public officers and magis 
trates and rulers in the community, will it not pro 
pagate vices more numerous, more malignant and 
pestilential among them ? Will it not render magis 
trates servile and fawning to their vicious superiors, 
and insolent and tyrannical to their inferiors ? Are 
insolence, abuse and impudence, more tolerable in a 
magistrate than in a subject ? Are they not more 
constantly and extensively pernicious ? And does 
not the example of vice and folly in magistrates 
descend and spread downwards among the people ? \ 

Besides, is not the insolence of officers, and sol 
diers, and seamen, in the army and navy, as mis 
chievous as that of porters, or of sailors in the mer 
chant service ? Are not riots, raised and made by 
armed men, as bad, as those by unarmed ? Is not an 
assault upon a civil officer, and a rescue of a prisoner 
from lawful authority, made by soldiers with swords 
or bayonets, as bad, as if made by tradesmen with 
staves ? 

Are not the killing of a child by R,, 1 and the slaugh 
ter of half a dozen citizens by a party of soldiers, as 
bad as pulling down a house or drowning a cargo of

tea, even if both should be allowed to be unlawful &gt; 
Parties may go on declaiming, but it is not easy to 
say, which party has excited most riots, which has 
published most libels, which has propagated most 
slander, and defamation ? Verbal scandal has been 
propagated in great abundance by both parties ; but 
there is this difference, that one party have enjoyed 
almost all public offices, and therefore, their defama 
tion has been spread among the people more secretly, 
more maliciously and more effectually. It has gone 
/ with greater authority, and been scattered by instru 
ments more industrious. The ministerial newspa 
pers have swarmed with as numerous and as ma 
licious libels as the anti ministerial ones. Fleet s pa 
per, Mein s Chronicle, &c. &c., have been as virulent as 
any that was ever in the province. These bickerings 
of opposite parties, and their mutual reproaches, their 
declamations, their sing-song, their triumphs and de 
fiances, their dismals and prophecies are all delu 
sion. 

We very seldom hear any solid reasoning. I 
wish always to discuss the question, without all paint 
ing, pathos, rhetoric or flourish of every kind. And 
the question seems to me to be, whether the Ameri- 
/ can colonies are to be considered as a distinct com 
munity so far as to have a right to judge for them 
selves, when the fundamentals of their government 
are destroyed or invaded ? or whether they are to be 
considered as a part of the whole British empire, 
the whole English nation, so far as to be bound in 
honor, conscience or interest by the general sense 



LETTERS. 



11 



of the whole nation ? However, if this was the rule, 
I believe it is very far from the general sense of the 
whole nation, that America should be taxed by the 
British parliament. If the sense of the whole of the 
Empire could be fairly and truly collected, it would 
appear, I believe, that a great majority would be 
against taxing us, against or without our consent. It 
is very certain, that the sense of parliament is not 
the sense of the empire, nor a sure indication of it. 
But, if all other parts of the empire were agreed 
unanimously in the propriety and rectitude of taxing 
us, this would not bind us. It is a fundamental, 
inherent and unalienable right of the people, that they 
have some check, influence or control in their su 
preme legislature. If the right of taxation is con 
ceded to parliament, the Americans have no check 
or influence at all left. This reasoning never was 
nor can be answered. 

JOHN ADAMS. 



LETTER IV. 

Falmouth, 7 July, 1774. 

MY DEAR, 

HAVE you seen a list of the addressers of the late 
Governor ? There is one abroad, with the character, 
p-ofession or occupation of each person against his 
name. I have never seen it, but Judge Brown saye, 



12 LETTER!. 

against the name of Andrew Faneuil Phillips is 
" Nothing." And that Andrew, when he first heard 
of it, said : " Better be nothing with one side, than 
every jhing with the other." This was witty and 
smart, whether Andrew said it, or, what is more likely, 
it was made for him. A notion prevails among all 
parties, that it is politest and genteelest to be on the 
side of Administration; that the better sort, the 
wiser few are on one side ; and that the multitude, 
the vulgar, the herd, the rabble, the mob only are on 
the other. So difficult it is for the frail, feeble mind 
of roan to shake itself loose from all prejudice and 
habits. However Andrew or his prompter is perfect 
ly right in his judgment, and will finally be proved to 
be so, that the lowest on the Tory scale will make it 
more for his interest than the highest on the Whig- 
gish. And as long as a man adheres immovably to 
his own interest, and has understanding or luck enough 
to secure and promote it, he will have the character 
of a man of sense, and will be respected by a selfish 
world. I know of no better reason for it than this, 
that most men are conscious that they aim at their 
own interest only, and that if they fail, it is owing to 
short sight or ill luck, and therefore they can t blame, 
but secretly applaud, admire and sometimes envy those, 
whose capacities have proved greater and fortunes 
more prosperous. 

I am engaged in a famous cause. The cause of 
King of Scarborough versus a mob that broke into his 
house and rifled his papers and terrified him, his wife, 
children and servants in the night. The terror and

distress, the distraction and horror of this family can 
not be described by words, or painted upon canvass. 
It is enough to move a statue, to melt a heart of stone, 
to read the story. A mind susceptible of the feelings 
of humanity, a heart which can be touched with sen 
sibility for human misery and wretchedness mustlre^ 
luct, must burn with resentment and indignation at 
such outrageous injuries. These private mobs I do 
and will detest. If popular commotions can be justi 
fied in opposition to attacks upon the Constitution, it 
can be only, when fundamentals are invaded, nor then, 
unless for absolute necessity, and with great caution. 
But these tarrings and featherings, this breaking open 
houses by rude and insolent rabble in resentment for 
private wrongs, or in pursuance of private prejudices 
and passions, must be discountenanced. It cannot be 
even excused upon any principle, which can be enter 
tained by a good citizen, a worthy member of so 
ciety. 

Dined with Mr. Collector Francis Waldo, Esquire, in 
company with Mr. Winthrop, the two Quincys and 
the two Sullivans, all very social and cheerful 
full of politics. S. Quincy s tongue ran as fast as 
any body s. He was clear in it, that the House of 
Commons had no right to take money out of our 
pockets more than any foreign state ; repeated 
large paragraphs from a publication of Mr. Burke s 
in 1766, and large paragraphs from Junius America- 
nus, &c. This is to talk and to shine before persons 
who have no capacity of judging, and who do not 
know, that he is ignorant of every rope in the ship.

from home, I hope, and not much more, I fear. I go 
mourning in my heart all the day long, though I say 
nothing. I am melancholy for the public and anxious 
for my family. As for myself, a frock and trowsers, 
a hoe and a spade would do for my remaining days. 

For God s sake make your children hardy , active, 



and industrious; for strength, activity and industry 
will be their only resource and dependence.

LETTER V. 

FaJmouth,9 July, 1774. 

T DBAS, 

I NEVER enjoyed better health in any of my jour* 
neys,but this has been the most tedious, the most irk 
some, the most gloomy and melancholy I ever made. 
I cannot, with all my philosophy and Christian resigna 
tion, keep up my spirits. The dismal prospect before 
me, my family, and my country, is ioo much for my 
fortitude. 



" Bear me. some God ! Oh quickly bear me hence 
To wholesome solitude, the nurse of sense ; 
Where contemplation prunes her rufnVd wings, 
And the free soul looks down to pity kings." 



LETTERS. 15 

The day before yesterday, a gentleman came and 
spoke to me, asked me to dine with him on Saturday ; 
said he was very sorry I had not better lodgings in 
town ; desired, if I came to town again, I would take 
a bed at his house and make his house my home, I 
should always be very welcome. I told him I had 
not the pleasure of knowing him. He said his name 
was Codman. I said I was very much obliged to him, 
but I was very well accommodated where I lodged. 
I had a clean bed and a very neat house, a chamber 
to myself, and every thing I wanted. 

Saturday, I dined with him, in company with Briga 
dier Prcble, Major Freeman and his son, &c., and a 
very genteel dinner we had. Salt fish and all its ap 
paratus, roast chickens, bacon, peas, as fine a salad as 
ever was made, and a rich meat pie. Tarts and cus 
tards, &c., good wine and as good punch as ever you 
made. A large, spacious, elegant house, yard and 
garden ; I thought I had got into the palace of a no 
bleman. After dinner, when I was obliged to come 
away, he renewed his invitation to me, to make his 
house my home whenever I shall come to town again. 
Friday,! dined with Colonel, Sheriff, alias Bill Tyng. 
Mrs. Ross and her daughter Mrs. Tyng dined with us, 
and the Court, and Clerk, and some of the bar. At ta 
ble, we were speaking about Captain MacCarty, which 
led to the African trade. Judge Trowbridge said, 
" That was a very humane and Christian trade, to be 
sure, that of making slaves." " Ay," says I, " it makes 
no great odds ; it is a trade that almost all mankind have 
been concerned in, all over the globe, since Adam, 



16 LETTE1S. 

more or leas, in one way and another." This occa 
sioned a laugh. 

At another time, Judge Trowbridge said," It seems, 
by Colonel Barre s speeches, that Mr. Otis has acquired 
honor by releasing his damages to Robinson." "Yes," 
says I, " he has acquired honor with all generations. 19 
Trowbridge. " He did not make much profit, I think." 
Adams. " True, but the less profit, the more honor. 
He was a man of honor and generosity, and those 
who think he was mistaken, will pity him." 

Thus you see how foolish I am. I cannot avoid 
exposing myself before these high folks ; my feel 
ings will at times overcome my modesty and reserve, 
my prudence, policy and discretion. 1 have a zeal at 
my heart for my country and her friends, which I 
cannot smother or conceal ; it will burn out at times 
and in companies, where it ought to be latent in my 
breast. This zeal will prove fatal to the fortune and 
felicity of my family, if it is not regulated by a 
cooler judgment than mine has hitherto been. Colo 
nel Otis s phrase is, " The zeal-pot boils over." 

I am to wait upon brother Bradbury to meeting to 
day, and to dine with brother Wyer. When I shall 
get home, I know not, but if possible, it shall be be 
fore next Saturday night I long for that time to 
come, when my dear wife and my charming little prat 
tlers will embrace me. 

Your

LETTER VI. 



Princeton, New Jersey, 28 August, 1774. 
I RECEIVED your kind letter at New York, and it is 
not easy for you to imagine the pleasure it has given 
me. I have not found a single opportunity to write 
since I left Boston, excepting by the post, and I donH 
choose to write by that conveyance, for fear of foul 
play. But as we arc now within forty-two miles of 
Philadelphia, I hope there to find some private hand 
by which I can convey this. 

The particulars of our journey I must reserve, u&gt; 
be communicated after my return. It would take a 
volume to describe the whole. It has been upon the 
whole an agreeable jaunt. We have had opportuni 
ties to see the world and to form acquaintances with 
the most eminent and famous men, in the several 
Colonies we have passed through. We have been 
treated with unbounded civility, complaisance and 
respect. We yesterday visited Nassau Hall College, 
and were politely treated by the scholars, tutors, pro 
fessors, and President whom we are this day to hear 
preach. Tomorrow we reach the theatre of action. 8 
God Almighty grant us wisdom and virtue sufficient

for the high trust that is devolved upon us. The spirit 
of the people, wherever we have been, seems to be 
very favorable. They universally consider our cause 
as their own, and express the firmest resolution to 
/ abide by the determination of the Congress. 

I am anxious for our perplexed, distressed province ; 
hope * .they will be directed into the right path. Let- 
me entreat you, my dear, to make yourself as easy 
and quiet as possible. Resignation to the will of 
Heaven is our only resource in such dangerous times. j $ 

r Prudence and caution should be our guides. I have 
the strongest hopes that we shall yet see a clearer 
sky and better times. 

Remember my tender love to little Abby teU her 
she must write me a letter and inclose it in the next 
you send. I am charmed with your amusement with 
our little Johnny. Tell him I am glad to hear he is 
so good a boy as to read to his mamma for her enter- ! 

tainment, and to keep himself out of the company of 
rude children. Tell him I hope to hear a good ac 
count of his accidence and nomenclature when I re 
turn. Remember me to all inquiring friends, partic 
ularly to uncle Quincy, your papa and family, and 
Dr. Tufts and family. Mr. Thaxter, I hope, is a 
good companion, in your solitude. Tell him, if he 
devotes his soul and body to his books, I hope, not* 
withstanding the darkness of these days, he will not 
find them unprofitable sacrifices in future. I have 
received three very obliging letters from Tudor, 
Trumbull and Hill. They have cheered us in our 
wanderings and done us much service. 



LETTERS. 19 

Your account of the rain refreshed me. I hope 
our husbandry is prudently and industriously man 
aged. Frugality must be our support. Our expen 
ses in this journey will be very great. Our only [re 
compense will ] be the consolatory reflection that wo 
toil, spend our time and [encounter] dangers for the 
public good happy indeed if we do any good. 

The education of our children is never out of my 
mind. Train them to virtue. Habituate them to in- 
- dustry, activity and spirit. Make them consider every 
vice as shameful and unmanly. Fire them with 
ambition to be useful. Make them disdain to be 
destitute of any useful or ornamental knowledge or 
accomplishment. Fix their ambition upon great and 
solid objects, and their contempt upon little, frivolous 
and useless ones. It is time, my dear, for you to be 
gin to teach them French. Every decency, grace and 
honesty should be inculcated upon them. 

1 have kept a few minutes by way of journal, which 
shall be your entertainment when I come home ; but 
we have had so many persons and so various charac 
ters to converse with, and so many objects to view, 
that I have not been able to be so particular as I could 
wish. I am, with the tenderest affection and concern, 
Your wandering

Philadelphia, 8 September, 1774. 
r DBA*, 

WHEN or where this letter will find you, I know not 
In what scenes of distress and terror, I cannot fore 
see. We have received a confused account from 
Boston of a dreadful catastrophe. The particulars 
we have not heard. We are waiting with the utmost 
anxiety and impatience, for further intelligence. 
The effect of the news we have, both upon the Con 
gress and the inhabitants of this city, was very great. 
Great indeed ! Every gentleman seems to consider 
the bombardment 1 of Boston as the bombardment 
of the capital of his own province. Our delibera 
tions arc grave and serious indeed. 

It is a great affliction to me that I cannot write to 
you oftener than I do. But there are so many 
hindrances, that I cannot. It would fill volumes, to 
give you an idea of the scenes I behold, and the 
characters I converse with. We have so much busi 
ness, so much ceremony, so much company, so many 
visits to receive and return, that I have not time to 
write. And the times are such as to make it impru 
dent to write freely. 

1 A rumor of this kind hau been spread, occasioned bj the 
military preparations, made by General Gage around the town, 
to guard against surprise. 






LETTERS. 



21 



We cannot depart from this place until the busi 
ness of the Congress is completed, and it i.s the 
general disposition to proceed slowly. When I shall 
be at home I can t say. If there is distress and dan 
ger in Boston, pray invite our friends, as many as 
possible, to take an asylum with you Mrs. Gushing 
and Mrs. Adams, if you can. There is in the 
Congress a collection of the greatest men upon this 
continent in point of abilities, virtues, and fortunes. 
The magnanimity and public spirit which I see here 
make me blush for the sordid, venal herd which I 
have seen in my own Province. The Addressers, 
and the new Councillors, 1 are held in universal con 
tempt and abhorrence from one end of the continent 
to the other. 

Be not under any concern for me. There is little 
danger from any thing we shall do at the Congress. 
There is such u spirit through the colonies, and the 
members of the Congress are such characters, that no 
danger can happen to us, which will not involve the 
whole continent in universal desolation ; and in that 
case, who would wish to live ? 

Adieu. 

JOHN ADAMS.

Philadelphia, 14 September, 1774. 

MY DC AH, 

I RATE written but once to you since I left you* 
This is to be imputed to a variety of causes, which 
I cannot explain for want of time. It would fill vol 
umes to give you an exact idea of the whole tour. 
My time is totally filled from the moment I get out 
of bed until I return to it. Visits, ceremonies, com 
pany, business, newspapers, pamph ets, &c. &c. &c. 

The Congress will, to all present appearance, be 
well united, and in such measures as, I hope, will give 
satisfaction to the friends of our country. A Tory 
here is the most despicable animal in the creation. 
Spiders, toads, snakes are their only proper emblems. 
The Massachusetts Councillors and Addressers are 
held in curious esteem here, as you will see. The 
spirit, the firmness, the prudence of our province are 
vastly applauded, and we are universally acknowledg 
ed, the saviours and defenders of American liberty. 
The designs and plans of the Congress must not be 
communicated until completed, and we shall move 
with great deliberation. 

When I shall come home I know not, but at pre 
sent, I do not expect to take my leave of this city 
these four weeks. My compliments, love, service, 
where they arc due. My babes are never out of my 
mind, nor absent from my heart

LETTER IX. 



Philadelphia, 16 September, 1774. 

HAVING a leisure moment, while the Congress is 
assembling, I gladly embrace it to write you a line. 
When the Congress first met, Mr. Gushing made a 
motion that it should be opened with prayer. It was 
opposed by Mr. Jay of New York and Mr. Rutledge 
of South Carolina, tocause we were so divided 
in religious sentiments ; some Episcopalians, some 
Quakers, some Anabaptists, some Presbyterians, and 
some Congregational ists, that we could not join in the 
same act of worship. Mr. Samuel Adams arose 
and said, u he was no bigot, and could hear a prayer 
from a gentleman of piety and virtue, who was at 
the same time a friend to his country. He was a 
stranger in Philadelphia, but had heard that Mr. 
Duche " (Dushay they pronounce it) " deserved that 
character, and therefore he moved, that Mr. Duche, 
an episcopal clergyman, might be desired to read 
prayers to the Congress tomorrow morning." The 
motion was seconded and passed in the affirmative. 
Mr. Randolph, our President, waited on Mr. Duche 
and received for answer that, if his health would 
permit, he certainly would. Accordingly, next morn 
ing he appeared with his clerk and in his pontificals, 
and read several prayers in the established form, and 
then read the collect for the seventh day of Septem 
ber, which was the thirty-fifth Psalm. You must 



24 LETTERS. 

remember, this was the next morning after we heard 
the horrible rumor of the cannonade of Boston. 
I never saw a greater effect upon an audience. It 
seemed as if Heaven had ordained that Psalm to be 
read on that morning. 

After this, Mr. Duche, unexpectedly to every body, 
struck out into an extemporary prayer, which filled the 
bosom of every man present. I must confess, I 
never heard a better prayer, or one so well pronounc 
ed. Episcopalian as he is, Dr. Cooper himself 
never prayed with such fervor, such ardor, such 
earnestness and pathos, and in language so elegant 
and sublime, for America, for the Congress, for the 
province of Massachusetts Bay, and especially the 
town of Boston. It has had an excellent effect upon 
every body here. I must beg you to read that 
Psalm. If there was any faith in the sortes Yir- 
gilianse, or sortes Homericae, or especially the sortes 
Biblicse, it would be thought providential. 

It will amuse your friends to read this letter and 
the 35th Psalm to them. Read it to your father and 
Mr. Wibird. I wonder what our Braintree church 
men would think of this. Mr. Duche is one of the 
most ingenious men, and best characters, and greatest 
orators in the episcopal order upon this continent ; 
yet a zealous friend of liberty and his country. 

I long to see my dear family God bless, preserve, 
and prosper it. 

Adieu. 

JOHN ADAMS.

LETTER X. 



Philadelphia, 18 September, 1774. 

MT DEAR, 

I RECEIVED your very agreeable letter by Mr. Mars- 
ton, and have received two others which gave mo 
much pleasure. I have written several letters, but 
whether they have reached you, 1 know not. There 
is so much rascality in the management of letters now 
come in fashion, that I am determined to write no 
thing of consequence, not even to the friend of my bo 
som, but by conveyances which 1 can be sure of. 

The proceedings of the Congress arc all a profound 
secret as yet, except two votes which were passed 
yesterday, and ordered to be printed. You will. see 
them from every quarter. These votes 1 were passed 
in full Congress with perfect unanimity. The esteem, 
the affection, the admiration for the people of Boston 
and the Massachusetts, which were expressed yes 
terday, and the fixed determination that they should 
be supported, were enough to melt a heart of stone. 
I saw the tears gush into the eyes of the old, grave, 
pacific Quakers of Pennsylvania. 

You cannot conceive, my dear, the hurry of busi 
ness, visits, and ceremonies which we are obliged to 
go through. 

We have a delicate course to steer between too 

1 These resolutions will be found in the journals of the first 
Congress for Saturday, 17 September, 1774.

much activity, and too much insensibility in our criti 
cal, interested situation. I flatter myself, however, 
that we shall conduct our embassy in such a manner, 
as to merit the approbation of our country. It has 
taken us much time to get acquainted with the tem 
pers, views, characters and designs of persons, and to 
let them into the circumstances of our province. My 
dear, do intreat every friend I have to write me. 
Every line which comes from our friends is greedily 
inquired after, and our letters have done us vast ser 
vice. Middlesex and Suffolk have acquired unbound 
ed honor here. There is no idea of submission here 
in anybody s head. 

Thank my dear Abby for her letter ; tell her it 
has given me great spirits. Kiss all my sweet ones 
for me. 

Adieu. 

JOHN ADAMS.

Philadelphia, 18 September, 1774. 

MY DKAB, 

IN your last, 1 you inquire tenderly after my health, 
and how we found the people upon our journey, and 

1 See MM. Adams * letter, dated 2 September, 1774, Vol. 
I. p. 15. 



LETTERS. 27 

how wfi were treated. I have enjoyed as good health 
as usual, and much more than I know how to account 
for, when I consider the extreme heat of the weather, 
and the incessant feasting I have endured ever since 
I left Boston. 

The people in Connecticut, New York, the Jerseys, 
and Pennsylvania, we have found extremely well prin 
cipled, and very well inclined, although some persons 
in New York and Philadelphia wanted a little anima 
tion. Their zeal, however, has increased wonderful 
ly since we began our journey. When the horrid 
news was brought here of the bombardment of Bos 
ton, which made us completely miserable for two 
days, we saw proofs both of the sympathy and the 
resolution of the continent. War! war! war! was 
the cry, and it was pronounced in a tone which would 
have done honor to the oratory of a Briton or a Ro 
man. If it had proved true, you would have heard 
the thunder of an American Congress. 

I have not time, nor language to express the hospi 
tality and the studied and expensive respect with 
which we have been treated in every stage of our pro 
gress. If Camdcn, Chatham, Richmond and St. Asaph 
had travelled through the country, they could not have 
been entertained with greater demonstrations of re 
spect than Cusjiing, Paine, and the brace of Adamses 
have been. The particulars will amuse you when we 
return. 

I confess, the kindness, the affection, the applause 
which have been given to me, and especially to our 
province, have many n time filled my bosom and 
streamed from my eyes.

MY DEAR, 

I AM very well yet. Write to me as often as you 
can, and send your letters to the office in Boston, or 
to Mr. Crunch s, whence they will be sent by the first 
conveyance. 

I am anxious to know how you can live without 
government But the experiment must be tried. 
The evils will not be found so dreadful as you appre 
hend them. Frugality, my dear, frugality, economy, 
parsimony, must be our refuge. I hope the ladies are 
every day diminishing their ornaments, and the gen 
tlemen too. Let us eat potatoes, and drink water. 
Let us wear canvass, and undressed sheepskins, 
rather than submit to the unrighteous, and ignomin 
ious domination that is prepared for us. 

Tell Brackett I shall make him leave off" drinking 
rum. We can t let him fight yet. My love to my 
dear ones.

I would not lose the opportunity of writing to you,

Tedious indeed is our business slow as snails. 
I have not been used to such ways. We sit only 
before dinner. We dine at four o clock. We are 
crowded with a levee in the evening.

state you must be in, amidst the confusion and 
dangers which surround you. I long to return and

administer all the consolation in my power, but when 
I shall have accomplished all the business I have 
to do here, I know not, and if it should be neces 
sary to stay here till Christmas, or longer, in order 
to effect our purposes, I am determined patiently to 
wait 

Patience, forbearance, long suffering are the les- 
sons taught here for our province, and at the same 
time, absolute and open resistance to the new Govern 
ment. I wish I could convince gentlemen of the 
danger, or impracticability of this as fully as I be 
lieve it myself. The art and address of ambassadors 
from a dozen belligerent powers of Europe ; nay, of 
a conclave of cardinals at the election of a pope ; 
or of the princes in Germany at the choice of an 
Emperor, would not exceed the specimens we have 
seen ; yet the Congress all profess the same political 
principles. They all profess to consider our province, 
as suffering in the common cause, and indeed they 
seem to feel for us, as if for themselves. We have 
had as great questions to discuss as ever engaged the 
attention of men, and an infinite multitude of them. 

I received a very kind letter from Deacon Palmer, 
acquainting me with Mr. Cranch s designs of remov 
ing to Braintree, which I approve very much, and 
wish I had a house for every family in Boston, and 
abilities to provide for them in the country. I sub 
mit it to you, my dear, whether it would not be best 
to remove all the books, and papers, and furniture in 
the Office at Boston up to Braintree. There will 
be no business there, nor any where, I suppose, and 



LETTERS. 31 

my young friends can study there better than in Bos 
ton at present. 

I shall be killed with kindness in this place. We 
go to Congress at nine, and there we stay, most 
earnestly engaged in debates upon the most abstruse 
mysteries of state, until three in the afternoon ; then 
we adjourn, and go to dine with some of the nobles 
of Pennsylvania at four o clock, and feast upon ten 
thousand delicacies, and sit drinking Madeira, Clar 
et and Burgundy till six or seven, and then go home 
fatigued to death with business, company, and care. 
Yet I hold it out surprisingly. 

Yours, most affectionately, 

JOHN ADAMS. 



LETTER XV. 

Philadelphia, 7 October, 1774. 

MY DEAR, 

I THANK you for all your kind favors, I wish I could 
write to you much oftencr than I do. I wish I could 
write to you a dozen letters every day. But the busi 
ness before me is so arduous, and takes up my time 
so entirely, that I cannot write often. I had the 
characters and tempers, the principles and views of 
fifty gentlemen, total strangers to me, to study, and 
the trade, policy, and whole interest of a dozen prov 
inces to learn, when I came here. I have multitudes 



32 LETTERS, 

of pamphlets, newspapers, and private letters to read. 
I have numberless plans of policy and many argu 
ments to consider. I have many visits to make and 
receive, much ceremony to endure, which cannot 
he avoided, which, you know, I hate. 

There is a great spirit in the Congress. But our peo 
ple must be peaceable. Let them exercise every day J 
in the week, if they will; the more, the better. 
Let them furnish themselves with artillery, arms, and 
ammunition. Let them follow the maxim, which you 
say they have adopted, "In times of peace prepare 
for war." But let them avoid war if possible if 
possible, I say. 

Mr. Revere, will bring you the doings of the Con 
gress, who are now all around me, debating what ad 
vice to give to Boston and the Massachusetts Bay. 

We are all well hope our family is so. Re 
member me to them all. I have advised you before, 
to remove my Office from Boston to Braintree. It is 
now, I think, absolutely necessary. Let the best care 
be taken of all books and papers. Tell all my clerks 
to mind their books and study hard, for their country 
will stand in need of able counsellors. I must give you 
a general license to make my compliments to all my 
friends, and acquaintances. I have not time to name 
them particularly. 1 wish they would all write to me. 
If they leave letters at Edes and GilPs, they will soon 
be sent to me. 

I long to be at home, but I cannot say when. I 
will never leave the Congress until it rises, and when 
it will rise, I cannot say. And indeed I cannot say 



LETTERS. 33 

but we are bettor here than any where. We have 
fine opportunities Ivcre to serve Boston and Massa 
chusetts, by acquainting the whole continent with die 
true state of them. Our residence here greatly 
serves the cause. The spirit and principles of liber 
ty here are greatly cherished by our presence and 
conversation. The elections of last week prove this. 
Mr. Dickinson was chosen, almost unanimously, a 
representative of the county. The broad-brims be 
gan an opposition to your friend Mr. Mifilin, because 
he was too warm, in the cause. This instantly alarm 
ed the friends of liberty, and ended in the election of 
Mr. Milfiin by eleven hundred votes out of thirteen, 
and in the election of our Secretary, Mr. Charles 
Thomson, to be a burgess with him. This is consid 
ered here as a most complete and decisive victory in 
favor of the American cause. And, it is said, it will 
change the balance in the Legislature here against 
Mr. Galloway, who has been supposed to sit on the 
skirts of the American advocates. 

Mrs. MifTlin, who is a charming Quaker girl, often 
inquires kindly after your health. 

Adieu, my dear wife. God bless you and yours ; 
so wishes and prays, without ceasing, 

JOHN ADAMS.

LETTER XT1. 

Pluladelph,., 9 October, 1774. 

MY DF AR, 

I AM wearied to death with the life I lead. The busi 
ness of the Congress is tedious beyond expression. 
This assembly is like no other that ever existed. 
Every man in it is a great roan, an orator, a 
critic, a statesman ; and therefore, every man upon 
every question, must show his oratory, his criti 
cism, and his political abilities. The consequence of 
this is, that business is drawn and spun out to an im 
measurable length. I believe, if it was moved and 
seconded, that we should come to a resolution that 
three and two make five, we should be entertained 
with logic, and rhetoric, law, history, politics and 
mathematics, and then we should pass the resolution, 
unanimously, in the affirmative. The perpetual round 
of feasting too, which we are obliged to submit to, 
makes the pilgrimage more tedious to me. 

This day, I went to Dr. Allison s meeting in the 
forenoon, and heard the Dr. ; a good discourse upon 
the Lord s supper. This is a Presbyterian meet 
ing. I confess f am not fond of the Presbyterian 
meetings in this town. I had rather go to church. 
We have better sermons, better prayers, better speak 
ers, softer, sweeter music, and genteeler company. 
And I must confess, that the Episcopal church is quite 
as agreeable to my taste as the Presbyterian. They 







LETTERS. 35 

arc both slaves to the domination of the priesthood. 
I like the Congregational way best ; next to that, the 
Independent. 

This afternoon, led by a curiosity and good com 
pany, I strolled away to mother church, or rather, 
grandmother church. I mean the Romish Chapel. I 
heard a good, short, moral essay upon the duty of 
parents to their children founded in justice and chari 
ty, to take care of their interests, temporal and spir 
itual. This afternoon s entertainment was to me 
most awful and affecting. The poor wretches fingering 
their beads, chanting Latin, not a word of which 
they understood ; their pater- nostcrs and avc Ma 
rias ; their holy water ; their crossing themselves 
perpetually ; their bowing to the name of Jesus, 
wherever they hear it ; their bowings, and kneel- 
ings, and genuflections before the altar. The dress 
of the priest was rich w|lh lace. His pulpit was vel 
vet and gold. The altar-piece was very rich ; little 
images and crucifixes about ; wax candles lighted 
up. But how shall I describe the picture of our Sa 
viour, in a frame of marble over the altar, at full 
length, upon the cross in the agonies, and the blood 
dropping and streaming from his wounds ! The mu 
sic, consisting of an organ and a choir of singers, 
went all the afternoon, except sermon time. And 
the assembly chanted most sweetly and exquisitely. 

Here is everything which can lay hold of the eye, 
ear, and imagination. Everything which can charm, 
and bewitch the simple and ignorant. I wonder how 
Luther ever broke the spell. 

Adieu. JOHN ADAMS. 



36 LETTER*. 



LETTEE TVU. 

Hartford, 30 April, 1775. 

NEW YORK has appointed an ample representation in 
our Congress, and has appointed a provincial Con 
gress. The people of the city have seized the city 
arms and ammunition out of the hands of the Mayor, 
who is a creature of the Governor. Lord North will 
certainly be disappointed in his expectation of se 
ducing New York. The tories there durst not show 
their heads. The Jerseys are aroused, and greatly 
assist the friends of liberty in New York. North 
Carolina has done bravely ; chosen the old delegates 
in provincial Congress, and then confirmed the choice 
in general assembly, in opposition to all that Governor 
Martin could do. The assembly of this colony is 
now sitting at Hartford. We are treated with great 
tenderness, sympathy , friendship, and resf&gt;ect. Every 
thing is doing by this colony that can be done by 
men, both for New York and Boston. Keep your 
spirits composed and calm, and don t suffer your 
self to be disturbed by idle reports and frivolous 
alarms. We shall see better times yet. Lord North 
is ensuring us success. I am wounded to the heart 
with the news, this moment told me, of Josiah Quincy s 
death. 

1 Mr. Adams was now again on the road to Philadelphia, 
to attend the second session of the Congress.

LETTER XVIII. 

Hartford, 2 Mny, 1775. 

OUR hearts arc bleeding for the poor people of Bos 
ton. What will or can be done for them, I can t 
conceive. God preserve them. 

I take this opportunity to write, by our committee 
who were sent to this colony, just to let you know 
that I am comfortable, and shall proceed this after 
noon. Pray write to me, and get all my friends to 
write, and let me be informed of every thing that 
occurs. Send your letters to Colonel Palmer, or 
Doctor Warren, who will convey them. They will 
reach me sooner or later. This colony is raising six 
thousand men. Rhode Island, fifteen hundred. New 
York has shut up their port, seized the Custom House, 
arms, ammunition, &c., called a provincial Congress, 
and entered into an association to stand by whatever 
shall be ordered by the continental and their provin 
cial Congress. Dr. Cooper is fled on board a man of 
war, and the tories arc humbled in the dust. 

Tell my brothers I have bought some military books, 
and intend to buy more, so that I shall come back 
qualified to make them complete officers. Write me 
whether either of them intends to tako a command in 
the army. I won t advise them, but leave them to 
their own inclinations and discretion. But, if 
they should incline, they should apply to Colonel 
Palmer and Dr. Warren soon.

MR. ELIOT, of Fairfield, is this moment arrived, on 
his way to Boston. He read us a letter from the Doctor,

The Doctor s description of the melancholy of the 
town, is enough to melt a stone. The trials of that 
unhappy and devoted people are likely to be severe 
indeed. God grant that the furnace of affliction may 
refine them. God grant that they may be relieved \ 
from their present distress. 

It is arrogance and presumption, in human sagacity, 
to pretend to penetrate far into the designs of Heaven. 
The most perfect reverence and resignation becomes 
us, but I cannot help depending upon this, that the 
present dreadful calamity of that beloved town, is in 
tended to bind the colonies together in more indisso 
luble bonds, and to animate their exertions at this 
great crisis in the affairs of mankind. It has this 
effect in a most remarkable degree, as far as I have 
yet seen or heard. It will plead with all America 
with more irresistible persuasion than angels trumpet- 
tongued. 

In a cause which interests the whole globe, at a

distress, I am scarcely ever interrupted in the least 
degree by apprehensions for my personal safety. 1

In case of real danger, of which you cannot fail to 
have previous intimations, fly to the woods with our

Philadelphia, 29 May, 1775. 

MY DEAR, 

OUR amiable friend Hancock, who, by the way, is our 
President, is to send his servant tomorrow for Cam 
bridge. I am to send a few lines by him. If his 
man should come to you, to deliver this letter, treat 
him very kindly, because he is a kind, humane, clever 
fellow. 

We are distressed here for want of intelligence 
and information from you and from Boston, Cam 
bridge, &c. &c. &c. We have no regular advices. 
I received one kind letter from you in one from 
Colonel Warren. An excellent letter I had from

My eyes are better, my head is better, so are my

There is a good spirit here. But we have an amaz

The military spirit, which runs through the continent, 
is truly amazing. This city turns out two thousand 
men every day. Mr. Dickinson is a Colonel, Mr. 
Reed a Lieutenant-Colonel, Mr. Mifflin a Major. 
He ought to have been a General, for he has been 
the animating soul of the whole. 

Colonel Washington appears at Congress, in his 
uniform, and, by his great experience and abilities 
in military matters, is of much service to us. 

Oh that I were a soldier ! I will be. I am reading 
military books. Every body must, and will, and 
shall be a soldier.

LETTER XXI. 

Philadelphia, 10 June, 1775. 

MY DEAR, 

DOCTOR CHURCH returns to-day, and, with smarting 
eyes, I must write a few lines to you. I never had 
in my life such severe duty to do, and was never 
worse qualified to do it. My eyes depress my spirits, 
and my health is quite infirm. Yet I keep about, 
and attend Congress very constantly. 

I wish I could write freely to you, my dear, but I 
cannot. The scene before me is complicated enough. 
It requires better eyes, and better nerves than mine ; 
yet I will not despond. I will lay all difficulties pros 
trate at my feet. My health and life ought to be haz 
arded in the cause of my country, as well as your s, 
and all my friends. 

It is impossible to convey, to you any adequate 
idea of the embarrassments I am under. I wish that 
you and our friends may not be in greater distress 
than I am. I fear you arc. Pray let me know as 
often as possible. Our friends write to Mr. , not 
to me, this time. They don t let us know the state of 
Boston people, nor the state of the army in Boston, 
BO exactly as I could wish. 

Two days ago we saw a very wonderful phenome 
non in this city ; a field day, on which three battal 
ions of soldiers were reviewed, making full two 
thousand men, battalion men, light infantry, grena- 



42 LETTERS. 

diers, riflemen, light horse, artillery men with a fine 
train, all in uniforms, going through the manual ex 
ercise, and the manoeuvres, with remarkable dexteri- ) 
ty. AH this has been accomplished in this city since 
the 19th of April ; so sudden a formation of an 
army never took place any where. 

In Congress we are bound to secrecy. But, under 
the rose, 1 believe that ten thousand men will be main 
tained in the Massachusetts, and five thousand in 
New York, at the continental expense. 

We have a major Skene, just arrived from London 
with a commission to be Governor of Crown Point 
and Ticonderoga, and surveyor of the woods, &c., 
a close prisoner. He must dispute for his government 
with Arnold and Allen. 

My love and duty where due. 



LETTER XXII. 

Philadelphia, 10 Jane, 1775. 

MY DEAE, 

DH. CHURCH has given me a lotion which has helped 
my eyes so much that I hope you will hear from me 
oftener than you have done. Pray write me as often 
and particularly as possible. Send your letters to the 
care of the Committee of Safety, who will forward 
them. I long to know how you fare, and whether 
you are often discomposed with alarms. Guard your- 



LETTERS. 43 

self against them, my dear. I think you are in no 
danger. Don t let the groundless fears and fruitful 
imaginations of others affect you. Let me know 
what guards are kept ; and who were principally 
conc.erned in the battle 1 at Grape Island, as well as 
that at Chelsea. The reputation of our country 
men for valor is very high. I hope they will main 
tain it, as well as that for prudence, caution, and con 
duct. 

When I shall come home I know not. We have 
business enough before us, to detain us until the 31st 
of next December. No assembly ever had a greater 
number of great objects before them. Provinces, 
Nations, Empires are small things before us. I wish 
we were good architects. 



LETTER XXIII. 

Philadelphia, 11 June, 1775. 

MT DEAR, 

I HAVE been this morning to hear Mr. Duffield, a preach 
er in this city, whose principles, prayers and sermons, 
more nearly resemble those of our New England 
clergy, than any that I have heard. His discourse 
was a kind of exposition on the thirty-fifth chapter 
of Isaiah. America was the wilderness, and the

solitary place, and he said it would be glad, u rejoice 
and blossom as the rose." He laboured " to strengthen 
the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees." He 
" said to them that were of a fearful heart, Be strong, 
fear not. Behold, your God will come with vengeance, 
even God with a recompense ; he will come and save 
you." u No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast 
shall go up thereon, but the redeemed shall walk 
there, &c." He applied the whole prophecy to this 
country, and gave us as animating an entertainment 
as I ever heard. He filled and swelled the bosom 
of every hearer. 1 hope you have received a letter, 
in which I inclosed you a pastoral letter from the 
synod of New York and Philadelphia ; by this you 
will see, that the Clergy this way are but now begin 
ning to engage in politics, and they engage with a 
fervor that will produce wonderful effects. 



17 June. 

I can now inform you, that the Congress have made 
choice of the modest and virtuous, the amiable, gen 
erous and brave George Washington, Esquire, to be 
General of the American army, and that he is to re 
pair, as soon as possible, to the camp before Boston. 
This appointment will have a great effect in cement 
ing and securing the union of these colonies. The 
continent is really in earnest, in defending the coun 
try. They have voted ten companies of riflemen to 
be sent from Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia, 



LETTERS. 45 

to join the army before Boston. These arc an excel 
lent species of light infantry. They use a peculiar kind 
of musket, called a rifle. It has circular or grooves 
within the barrel, an^l carries a ball with great exact 
ness to great distances. They are the most accurate 
marksmen in the world. 

I begin to hope we shall not sit all summer. I 
hope the people of our province will treat the General 
with all that confidence and affection, that politeness 
and respect, which is due to one of the most impor 
tant characters in the world. The liberties of Amer 
ica depend upon him, in a great degree. I have never 
been able to obtain from our province any regular and 
particular intelligence, since I left it. Kent, Swift, 
Tudor, Dr. Cooper, Dr. Winthvop and others wroto 
me often last fall ; not a line from them this time. 

I have found this Congress like the last. When 
we first came together, I found a strong jealousy of us 
from New England, and the Massachusetts in partic 
ular. Suspicions entertained of designs of independ 
ency ; an American republic ; prcsbyterian princi 
ples, and twenty other things. Our sentiments were 
heard in Congress with great caution, and seemed to 
make but little impression ; but the longer we sat, 
the more clearly they saw the necessity of pushing 
vigorous measures. It has been so now. Every day 
we sit, the more we are convinced that the designs 
against us arc hostile and sanguinary, and that no 
thing but fortitude, vigor, and perseverance can save us. 
But America is a great unwieldy body. Its pro-

gress must be slow. It is like a large fleet sailing 
under convoy. The fleetest sailers must wait for the 
dullest and slowest. Like a coach and six, the 
swiftest horses must be slackened, and the slowest 
quickened, that all may keep an even pace. 

It is long since I heard from you. I fear yon 
have been kept in continual alarms. My duty and 
love to all. My dear children, come here and kiss 
me. We have appointed a continental fast. Mil 
lions will be upon their knees at once before their great 
Creator, imploring his forgiveness and blessing ; his 
smiles on American councils and arms. 

My duty to your uncle Quincy ; your papa, mam 
ma, and mine ; my brothers and sisters, and yours.

LETTER XXIV. 

Philadelphia, 18 June, 1775. 

MY DEAR, 

THIS letter, I presume, will go by the brave and 
amiable General Washington. Our army will have 
a group of officers equal to any service. Washing 
ton, Ward, Lee, Gates, Gridley, together with all the 
other New England officers, will make a glorious 
council of war. 

This Congress are all as deep as the delegates from 
the Massachusetts, and the whole continent as for-

ward as Boston. We shall have a redress of griev 
ances, or an assumption of all the powers of Gov 
ernment, legislative, executive and judicial, through 
out the whole Continent, very soon. Georgia is be 
stirring itself. I mean, the whole of it. The Parish 
of St. John s, which is one third of it, was with us 
before. 

I am, &c. 



LETTER XXV. 

Philadelphia, 23 June, 1775. 

MT DEAR, 

I HAVE this morning been out of town, to accompany 
our Generals, Washington, Lee and Schuyler, a little 
way on their journey to the American camp, before 
Boston. The three Generals were all mounted on 
horse-back, accompanied by Major Milliin, who is 
gone in the character of Aid-de-camp. All the 
delegates from the Massachusetts^ with their servants 
and carriages, attended. Many others of the delegates 
from the Congress ; a large troop of light horse in 
their uniforms ; many officers of militia, besides, in 
their s ; music playing, &c. &c. Such is the pride and 
pomp of war. I, poor creature, worn out with scrib 
bling for my bread and my liberty, low in spirits and 
weak in health, must leave others to wear the laurels 



48 LETTERS. 

which I have sown ; others to eat the bread which I 
have earned ; a common case. 

We had, yesterday, by the way of New York and 
New London, a report which distresses us almost as 
much as that we had last fall, of the cannonade of 
Boston. A battle at Bunker s hill, and Dorchester 
point Three Colonels wounded, Gardner mortally. 
We wait to hear more particulars. Our hopes and 
fears are, alternately, very strong. If there is any 
truth in this account, you must be in great confusion. 
/ God Almighty s providence preserve, sustain, and 
comfort you. 



27 June. 

This moment received two letters 1 from you. 
Courage, my dear. We shall be supported in life 
or comforted in death. I rejoice that m\ country 
men behaved so bravely, though not so skilfully con 
ducted as I could wish. I hope this defect will be 
remedied by the new modelling of the army. 
My love every where.

LETTER XXVI. 

Philadelphia, 7 July, 1775. 

MY DEAR, 

I HAVE received your very agreeable favors of June 
22 and 25. Thoy contain more particulars than any 
letters I had before received from anybody. 

It is not at all surprising to me, that the wanton, 
cruel, and infamous conflagration of Charlestown, the 
place of your father s nativity, should afllict him. 
Let him know that I sincerely condole with him on that 
melancholy event. It is a method of conducting war 
long since become disreputable among civilized na 
tions. But every year brings us fresh evidence that 
we have nothing to hope for, from our loving mother 
country, but cruelties more abominable than those 
which are practised by the savage Indians. 

The account you give me of the numbers slain on 
the side of our enemies, is afflicting to humanity, 
although it is a glorious proof of the bravery of our 
worthy countrymen. Considering all the disadvan 
tages under which they fought, they really exhibited 
prodigies of valor. Your description of the distresses 
of the worthy inhabitants of Boston and the other 
seaport towns, is enough to melt a heart of stone. 
Our consolation must be this, my dear, that cities

may be rebuilt, and a people, reduced to poverty, may 
acquire fresh property. But a constitution of govern 
ment, once changed from freedom, can never be re 
stored. Liberty once lost, is lost forever. When the 
people once surrender their share in the Legislature, 
and their right of defending the limitations upon the 
Government, and of resisting every encroachment 
upon them, they can never regain it. 

The loss of Mr. Mather s library, which was a col 
lection of books and manuscripts made by himself, his 
father, his grandfather, and great-grandfather, and 
was really very curious and valuable, is irreparable. 
The family picture you draw is charming indeed. 
My dear Abby, Johnny, Charley and Tommy, I long 
to see you, and to share with your mamma the pleas 
ures of your conversation. I feel myself much 
obliged to Mr. Bowdoin, Mr. Wibird and the two fam 
ilies you mention for their civilities to you. My com 
pliments to them. Does Mr. Wibird preach against 
oppression and the other cardinal vices of the times ? 
Tell him, the clergy here of every denomination, not 
excepting the Episcopalian, thunder and lighten every 
Sabbath. They pray for Boston and the Massachu 
setts. They thank God most explicitly and fervently 
for our remarkable successes. They pray for the 
American army. They seem to feel as if they were 
among you. 

You ask if every member feels for us? Every 
member says he does, and most of them really do. But 
most of them feel more for themselves. In every 
society of men, in every club I ever yet saw, you find 



LETTERS. 51 

some who are timid, their fears hurry them away up 
on every alarm. Some who are selfish and avari- 
3 cious, on whose callous hearts nothing but interest / 

and money can make impression. There are some 



persons in New York and Philadelphia, to whom a 
ship is dearer than a city, and a few barrels of flour 
than a thousand lives other men s lives, I mean. 

You ask, can they realize what we suffer ? I 
answer, no. They can t. They don t. And, to ex 
cuse them as well as I can, I must confess, I should 
not be able to do it myself, if I was not more acquaint 
ed with it by experience than they are. 

I am grieved fur Dr. Tuffs ill health, but rejoiced ex 
ceedingly at his virtuous exertions in the cause of his 
country. I am happy to hear that my brothers were 
at Grape Island, and behaved well. My love to them, 
and duty to my mother. 

It gives me more pleasure than I can express, to 
learn that you sustain with so much fortitude, the 
shocks and terrors of the times. You arc really 
brave, my dear. You are a heroine, and you havo 
reason to be. For the worst that can happen, can do 
you no harm. A soul as pure, as benevolent, as vir 
tuous and pious as yours, has nothing to fear, but 
everything to hope and expect from the last of human 
evils. I am glad you have secured an asylum, though 
I hope you will not have occasion for it. 

There is an amiable, ingenious hussy, named Betsey 
Smith, for whom I have a very great regard. Be pleased 
to make my love acceptable to her, and let her know 
that her elegant pen cannot be more usefully em-

ployed than in writing letters to her brother at Phila 
delphia, though it may be more agreeably, in writing 
billets-doux to young gentlemen. 

The other day, after I had received a letter of 
yours, with one or two others, Mr. William Barrell 
desired to read them. I put them into his hand, and 
the next morning had them returned in a large bundle 
packed up with two great heaps of pins, with a very po 
lite card requesting Portia s acceptance of them. 1 I 
shall bring them with me when 1 return. But when 
that will be, is uncertain. I hope, not more than a 
month hence. 

I have really had a very disagreeable time of it 
My health, and especially my eyes, have been so very 
bad, that I have not been so fit for business as I ought, 
and if I had been in perfect health,! should have had, 
in the present condition of my country and my friends, 
no taste for pleasure. But Dr. Young has made a 
kind of cure of my health, and Dr. Church of my 
eyes. 

I have received two kind letters from your uncle 
Smith. Do thank him for them. I shall forever love 
him for them. I love everybody that writes to me. 
I am, forever yours.

LETTER XXVII. 

Philadelphia, 23 July, 1775. 

MY DEAR, 

You have more than once, in your letters, 1 mentioned 
Dr. Franklin, and in one, intimated a desire that I 
should write you something concerning him. 

Dr. Franklin has hcen very constant in his attend 
ance on Congress from the beginning. His con 
duct hns been composed and grave, and, in the opin 
ion of many gentlemen, very reserved. He has not 
assumed any thing, nor affected to take the lead ; 
but has seemed to choose that the Congress should 
pursue their own principles and sentiments, and 
adopt their own plans. Yet he has not been back 
ward ; has been very useful on many occasions, and 
discovered a disposition entirely American. lie does 
not hesitate at our boldest measures, but rather seems 
to think us too irresolute and backward. He thinks 
us at present in an odd state, neither in peace nor 
war, neither dependent nor independent ; but he 
thinks that we shall soon assume a character more de- 
He thinks that we have the power of pre 
serving ourselves ; and that even if we should bo 
driven to the disagreeable necessity of assuming a to 
tal independency, and set up a separate state, we can 
maintain it. The people of England have thought 

1 Letters of Mrs. Adams, Vol. I. pp. 34 and 49. 






54 LETTERS. 

that the opposition in America, was wholly owing to 
Dr. Franklin ; and I suppose their scribblers will at 
tribute the temper and proceedings of Congress to j 
him ; but there cannot be a greater mistake. He 
has had but little share, further than to cooperate 
and to assist. He is however a great and good man. 
I wish his colleagues from this city were all like him ; 
particularly one, 1 whose abilities and virtues, formerly 
trumpeted so much in America, have been found 
wanting. There is a young gentleman from Penn 
sylvania, whose name is Wilson, whose fortitude, rec- UL? 
titude and abilities too, greatly outshine his master s. 
Mr. Biddle, the Speaker, has been taken off by sick 
ness, Mr. Mifllin is gone to the camp, Mr. Morton is 
ill too, so that this province has suffered by the timid 
ity of two overgrown fortunes. The dread of con 
fiscation or caprice, I know not what, has influenced 
them too much ; yet they were for taking arms, and 
pretended to be very valiant. 

This letter must be secret, my dear ; at least, com- 
municated with great discretion. 

Yours, 

JOHN ADAMS. 

1 An allusion to John Dickinson. He had labored hard and 
successfully to procure the adoption, by Congress, of a second 
petition to the King, against the opinion of many among the 
more zealous patriots; and this gave rise to the idea that he 
was lukewarm in the cause of resistance. See Gordon * His 
tory, Vol. I. p. 32.

LETTER XXVIII. 

Philadelphia, 30 July, 1775. 

NT DEAR. 

Tins letter is intended to go by my friend Mr. Wil 
liam Barrcll, whom I believe you have seen in Bos 
ton. If he calls at our house you will please to re 
ceive him complaisantly, and thank him for your 
present of pins. I have been treated by him with 
great civility, both at this, and the former Congress. 

This day I have heard my parish priest, Mr. Dufficld, 
from Chronicles xv. 1, 2. This gentleman never 
fails to adapt his discourse to the times. He pressed 
upon his audience the necessity of piety and virtue 
in the present times of adversity, and held up to their 
view the army before Boston, as an example. He 
understood, he said, that the voice of the swearer was 
scarcely heard ; that the Sabbath was well observed, 
and all immoralities discountenanced. No doubt there 
were vicious individuals, but the general character 
was good. I hope this good man s information 
is true, and that this will become more and more the 
true character of that camp. You may well suppose 
that this language was exceedingly pleasing to me. 

We have nothing new, but the arrival of some pow 
der. Three little vessels have certainly arrived, mak 
ing about ten tons in the whole, and four or five tons 
have arrived from South Carolina. A supply, I think 
now we shall certainly obtain. Congress have taken 



56 

measures for this end, which I hope to hare the pleas 
ure of explaining to you, in person, within a few days, 
as Congress have determined to adjourn to some time I 

in September. I could not vote for this myself, be 
cause I thought it might be necessary to keep togeth 
er ; but I could not blame those who did, for really 
we have been all so assiduous in business, in this ex 
hausting, debilitating climate, that our lives are more 
exposed than they would be in camp. 
Love to the children. 



LETTER TUX. 

Philadelphia, 1 October, 1775. 

r DEAR, 

THIS morning I received your two letters of 8 Sep 
tember and 16 September. What shall I say ? The 
intelligence they contain came upon me by surprise, 
as I never had the least intimation before, that any of 
my family was ill, excepting in a card from Mrs. 
Warren, received a few days ago, in which she in

You may easily conceive the state of mind in

at first, I suddenly thought of setting off immediately 
for Braintree, and I have not yet determined other 
wise. Yet the state of public affairs is so critical, that

I am half afraid to leave my station, although my 
presence here is of no great consequence. 

I feel, I tremble for you. Poor Tommy ! I hope, 
by this time, however, he has recovered his plump 
cheeks, and his fine tyloom. By your account of Pat 
ty, I fear, but still I will hope she has been supported, 
and is upon the recovery. I rejoice to learn that 
Abby and her brothers have hitherto escaped, and 
pray God that his goodness may be still continued to 
them. Your description of the distressed state of the 
neighbourhood is affecting indeed. It is not uncom 
mon for a train of calamities to come together. Fire, 
sword, pestilence, famine often keep company and 
visit a country in a flock. 

At this distance I can do no good to you or your s, 
I pray God to support you. I hope our friends and 
neighbours are kind as usual. I feel for them in the 
general calamity. I am so far from thinking you 
melancholy, that I am charmed with that admirable 
fortitude, and that divine spirit of resignation, which 
appear in your letters. I cannot express the satisfac 
tion it gives me, nor how much it contributes to sup 
port me. 

You have alarmed me, however, by mentioning 
anxieties which you do not think it proper to mention 
to any one. I am wholly at a loss to conjecture what 
they can be. If they arise from the letters, be assured 
that you may banish them forever. These letters l

very different from those which were expected from 
the publication of them. These effects I will explain 
to you sometime or other. As to the versification of

yawn or nod. I liave no anger at it, nay even 
scarcely contempt. It is impotent 

As to politics, we have nothing to expect hut the

help themselves, and if we obtain the divine aid by 
our own virtue, fortitude and perseverance, we may

somebody said, there was nobody on our side but the 
Almighty. The Doctor, 1 who is a native of Switzerland, 
and speaks but broken English, quickly replied, " Dat 
is enough. Dat is enough ;" and, turning to me, says 
he, " It puts me in mind of a fellow who once said,

LETTER XXX. 



Philadelphia, 2 October, 1775. 

EVERYTHING here is in as good a way as I could wish, 
considering the temper and designs of Administration. 
I assure you, the letters have had no such bad effects 
as the Tories intended, and as some of our short 
sighted Whigs apprehended ; so far otherwise, that I 
see and hear, every day, fresh proofs that everybody 
is coming fast into every political sentiment con 
tained in them. I assure you L could mention com 
pliments passed upon them, and if a serious decision 
could be had upon them, the public voice would be 
found in their favor. 

But I am distressed with cares of another kind. 
Your two letters arc never out of my thoughts. I 
should have mounted my horse, this day, for Braintrce, 
if I had not hopes of hearing further from you in a 
day or two. However, I will hope that your pros 
pects are more agreeable than they were, and that the 
children are all better, as well as the rest of the fam 
ily, and the neighbours. If I should hear more disa 
greeable advices from you, I shall certainly come

anything for the future, of public persons or things. 
Secrecy is so much exacted. But thus much I may 
say, that I never saw so serious and determined a

you write to me and by whom you send. Letters

LETTER XXII. 

Philadelphia, 7 October, 1775. 

MT DEAR, 

YESTERDAY, by the post, I received yours of 25 Sep 
tember. And it renewed a grief and anxiety, that 
were, before, almost removed from my mind. Two 
days before, I had the pleasure of a very valuable 
letter from Colonel Quincy, in which he kindly in 
formed me, that you and our family were so much 



LETTERS. Gl 

better, that you and my dear Abby had made a visit 
at his house ; and Mr. Williams, who brought the let- 
&gt; ter, acquainted me, that he had been to Braintree after 

the date of it, that you was in good spirits, that 
Tommy was so much better as to be playing abroad, 
and that he hoped Patty was not in danger. You will 
easily believe that this information gave me great 
pleasure and fine spirits. It really relieved me from 
n heavy load. But your last letter has revived my 
concern. I will still hope, however, that your excel 
lent mother will yet be spared for a blessing to her 
family, and an example to the world. I build my 
hopes of her recovery upon the advantage of a con 
stitution which has hitherto sustained so many attacks v 
and upon a long course of exact temperance, which, 
I hope, has deprived the distemper of its most dan 
gerous food and fuel. However, our lives are not in^. j 
our own power. It is our duty to submit. " The ways 
of Heaven are dark and intricate," its designs are 
often inscrutable, but are always wise and just and : 
good. 

It was long before I had the least intimation of the 
distress of the family, and I fear, that your not re 
ceiving so many letters from me as usual, may have 
been one cause of infelicity to you. Really, my dear, 
I have been more cautious than I used to be. It is 
not easy to know whom to trust in these times ; and 
if a letter, from any person in the situation I am in, 
can be laid hold of, there are so many lies made and 
told about it, so many false copies taken and dis 
persed, and so many false constructions put, that one 
ought to be cautious. 






3 LETTERS. 

The situation of things ia so alarming, that it is our 
duty to prepare our minds and hearts for every event* 
even the worst From my earliest entrance into life, 
I have been engaged in the public cause of America ; 
and from first to lost, I have had upon my mind a 
strong impression that things would be wrought up to 
their present crisis. I saw, from the beginning, that 
the controversy was of such a nature, that it never 
would be settled, and every day convinces me more 
and more. This has been the source of all the dis 
quietude of my life. It has Iain down and risen up 
with me these twelve years. The thought, that we 
might be driven to the sad necessity of breaking our 
connexion with Great Britain, exclusive of the car 
nage and destruction, which, it was easy to see, must 
attend the separation, always gave me a great deal of 
grief. And even now, I would cheerfully retire from 
public life forever, renounce all chance for profits or 
honors from the public, nay, I would cheerfully con 
tribute my little property, to obtain peace and liberty. 
But all these must go, and my life too, before I can 
surrender the right of my country to a free Constitu 
tion. I dare not consent to it. 1 should be the most 
miserable of mortals ever after, whatever honors or 
emoluments might surround me.

LETTER XXXII. 



[Philadelphia], 10 October, 1775. 

I AM much concerned lest you should feel an addition 
to your anxieties, from your having so seldom heard 
, from me. But t pray you to dismiss all concern 
about me. I am happier far, than I was hcfore the 
adjournment. My health is better, and business and 
conversation are much more to my taste. 

The surprising intelligence \vc have in private letters 
concerning the Director of the Hospital, 1 has made 
me more cautious of writing than ever. I must be 
excused from writing a syllable of anything of any 
moment. My letters have been and will be nothing 
but trifles. I don t choose to trust the post. I am 
afraid to trust private travellers. They may peep. 
Accidents may happen ; and I would avoid, if I could, 
even ridicule, but especially mischief. 

Pray, bundle up every paper, not already hid, and 
conceal them in impenetrable darkness. Nobody 
knows what may occur. 

My love to those who are dearest to us both. Send 
yours to the care of the gentleman whose care has 
hitherto been successful. Date them in time, but not 
place, and assume a new fictitious name.

LETTER XJDU1I. 

[Philadelphia], 13 October, 1775. 

I THIS day received yours of the 29th of September 
and the 1st of October. Amidst ail your afflictions, 
I am rejoiced to find that you all along preserve so 
proper and so happy a temper ; that you are sensible 
" the consolations of religion are the only sure com- . 
forters." It is the constitution under which we are 
born, that if we live long ourselves, we must bury 
our parents, and all our elder relations, and many of 
those who are younger. I have lost a parent, a child 
and a brother, and each of them left a lasting im 
pression on my mind. But you and I have many 
more relations and very good friends to follow to the 
house appointed for all flesh, or else we must be fol 
lowed by them. I bewail, more than I can express, 
the loss of your excellent mother. I mourn the loss 
of so much purity, and unaffected piety and virtue, 
to tho world. I know of no better character left in 
it I grieve for you, and your brother and sisters. I 
grieve for your father, whose age will need the suc 
cor of so excellent a companion. But 1 grieve for 
nobody more than my children. Her most amiable 
and discreet example, as well as her kind skill and 
care, I have ever relied upon in my own mind, for 
the education of these little swarms. Not that I have 
not a proper esteem for the capacity and disposition 



LETTERS. 65 

of the mother, but I know that the efforts of the 
grandmother are of great importance, when they 
second those of the parent. And I am sure that my 
children arc the better for the forming hand of their 
grandmother. It gives me great joy to learn that ours 
are well. Let us be thankful for this, and many 
other blessings yet granted us. Pray, my dear, 
cherish in their minds the remembrance of their 
grandmamma, and remind them of her precepts and 
example. God Almighty grant to you and to every 
branch of the family, all the support that you want. 
You and I, my dear, have reason, if ever mortals 
had, to be thoughtful ; to look forward beyond the tran 
sitory scene. Whatever is preparing for us, let us be 
prepared to receive. It is time for us to subdue our 
passions of every kind. The prospect before us is 
an ocean of uncertainties, in which no pleasing objects 
appear. We have few hopes, excepting that of pre 
serving our honor and our consciences untainted, and 
a free Constitution to our country. Let me be sure 
of these, and, amidst all my weaknesses, I cannot be 
overcome. With these, I can be happy in extreme 
poverty, in humble insignificance, may I hope and 
believe, in death : Without them, I should be mis 
erable with a crown upon my head, millions in my 
coiTbrs and a gaping, idolizing multitude at my feet. 

My heart is too full of grief for you and our friends, 
to whom I wish you to present my regards, to say 
anything of news or politics. Yet the affair of the 
Surgeon-General is so strange and important an event, 
that I cannot close this gloomy letter without adding

a sigh for this imprudent, unfortunate man. I know 
not whether the evidence will support the word 
treachery, but what may we not expect after trea 
chery to himself, his wife and children ? 



LETTER XXXIV. 



[Philadelphia], 19 October, 1775. 

IT is some time since I wrote you, and I have nothing 
now to write, but repetitions of respect and affection. I 
am anxious to hear from you. I hope the family is 
better ; that your grief for the great loss we have all 
sustained is somewhat abated. I hope your father 
and sister Betsey are well, though they must be 
greatly afflicted. Give my love to Betsey, and let 
her know that I feel most intimately for her, as well 
as for myself and the rest. I consider the stroke 
must fall heavier upon her, as it was nearer to her. 
Her prosperity is near my heart. I wish her every 
blessing which she can possibly wish for herself. 

Really it is very painful to be four hundred miles 
from one s family and friends, when we know they 
are in affliction. It seems as if it would be a joy to me 
to fly home, even to share with you your burdens and 
misfortunes. Surely, if I were with you, it would be 
my study to allay your griefs, to mitigate your pains, 
and to divert your melancholy thoughts. When I 



LETTERS. 67 

shall come home, I know not. We have so much to 
do, and it is so difficult to do it right, that \vc must 
learn patience. Upon my word, I think, if ever I 
were to come here again, I must bring you with me. 
I could live here pleasantly, if I had you with me. 
W T ill you come and have the small pox 1 here ? I 
wish I could remove all the family, our little daughter 
and sons, and all go through the distemper here. 
What if we should ? Let me please myself with the 
thought however. 

Congress has appointed Mr. Wythe, Mr. Deanc 
and me, a Committee to collect an account of the hos 
tilities committed by the troops and ships, with proper 
evidence of the number and value of the houses and 
other buildings destroyed or damaged, the vessels cap 
tivated, and the cattle, sheep, hogs, &c., taken. We 
are about writing to all the general assemblies of New 
England, and to many private gentlemen in each 
colony, to assist us in making the collections. The 
gentlemen with me are able men. Deane s charac 
ter, you know. He is a very ingenious man and an 
able politician. Wythe is a new member from Vir 
ginia, a lawyer of the highest eminence in that pro 
vince, a learned and very laborious man ; so that we 
may hope this commission will be well executed. A 
tale of woe it will be ! Such a scene of distress and 
destruction, and so patiently and magnanimously 
borne ! Such a scene of cruelty and barbarity, so 
unfeelingly committed ! I mention this to you, my

dear, that you may look up, and transmit to me, a 
paper which Colonel Palmer lent me, containing a re 
lation of the Charlestown battle, which was transmit 
ted to England by the Committee of safety. This 
paper I must have, or a copy of it. 

I wish I could collect, from the people of Boston or 
others, a proper set of paintings of the scenes of dis 
tress and misery brought upon that town from the 
commencement of the Port bill. Posterity must hear 
a story that shall make their ears to tingle.

LETTER XXXV. 



[Philadelphia], 23 October, 1775. 

YESTEBDAY, yours of October 9th came to hand. Your 
letters never failed to give me pleasure. The greatest 
pleasure that I take, is in receiving them. And although 
every one, which has yet come to hand, is replete with 
melancholy tidings, yet I can truly say, I never was 
so earnest to receive them. I rejoice in the happy 
principles and the happy temper which apparently dic 
tated them all. 

I feel myself much affected with the breach upon 
the family. But we can count a mother, a brother, 
an aunt, and a brother s child among the slain by this 
cruel pestilence. May God Almighty put a stop to

its rage and humble us under the ravages already 
made by it. The sorrows of all our friends, on the 
I loss of your mother, are never out of my mind. I 

pray God to spare my parent, whose life has been 
prolonged by his goodness hitherto, as well as yours 
that survives. The tremendous calamities already 
felt of fire, sword and pestilence may be only harbin 
gers of greater still. We have no security against 
calamity here. This planet is its region. The only 
principle is to be prepared for the worst events. 

If 1 could write as well as you, my sorrow would 
be as eloquent as yours, but, upon my word, I cannot. 

The unaccountable event, which you allude to, has 
reached this place and occasioned a fall. I would be 
glad, however, that the worst construction might not be 
put. Let him l have fair play ; though I doubt. 

The man who violates private faith, cancels solemn 
obligations, whom neither honor nor conscience holds, 
shall never be knowingly trusted by me. Had I 
known, when I first voted for a Director of an Hospital, 
what I heard afterwards, when I was down, I would 
not have voted as I did. Open, barefaced immorality 
ought not to be so countenanced. Though I think a 
fatality attends us in some instances, yet a divine pro 
tection and favor is visible in others ; and let us be 
cheerful, whatever happens. Cheerfulness is not a 
sin in any times. 

I am afraid to hear again almost, lest some other 
should be sick in the house. V Yet I hope better, and

LETTER 



[Philadelphia 1 ], 29 October, 1775. 

I CANNOT exclude from my mind your melancholy 
situation. The griefs of your father and sisters, your 
uncles and aunts, as well as the remoter connexions, 
often crowd in upon me, when my whole attention 
ought to be directed to other subjects. Your uncle 
Quincy, my friend as well as uncle, must regret the 
loss of a beloved sister. Doctor Tufts, my other 
friend, I know, bewails the loss of a friend, as well as 
an aunt and a sister. Mr. C ranch, the friend of my 
youth, as well as of my riper years, whose tender 
heart sympathizes with his fellow creatures in every 
aflliction and distress, in this case, feels the loss of a 
friend, a fellow Christian and a mother. But, alas ! 
what avail these mournful reflections ? The best thing 
we can do, the greatest respect we can show to the

memory of our departed friend, is to copy into our 
own lives, those virtues which, in her lifetime, ren 
dered her the object of our esteem, love and admira 
tion. I must confess, I ever felt a veneration for her, 
which seems increased by the news of her transla 
tion. 

Above all things, my dear, let us inculcate these 
great virtues and bright excellencies upon our child 
ren. 

Your mother had a clear and penetrating under 
standing, and a profound judgment, as well as an 
honest, and a friendly and a charitable heart. There is 
one thing, however, which you will forgive me if I 
hint to you. Let me ask you rather, if you arc not I 
of my opinion ? Were not her talents and virtues 
too much confined to private, social and domestic life ? 
My opinion of the duties of religion and morality 
comprehends a very extensive connexion with society 
at large and the great interests of the public. Does 
not natural morality and much more Christian benevo 
lence make it our indispensable duty to lay ourselves 
out to serve our fellow Creatures, to tho utmost, of our 
power, in promoting and supporting those great politi 
cal systems and general regulations, upon which the 
happiness of multitudes depends ? The benevolence, 
charity, capacity and industry which, exerted in pri 
vate life, would make a family, a parish or a town 
happy, employed upon a larger scale, in support of 
the great principles of virtue and freedom of political 
regulations, might secure whole nations and genera- 
lions from misery, want and contempt. Public vir-

tues and political qualities therefore should be inces 
santly cherished in our children. \ 



LETTER XXXVII. 



[Philadelphia], 29 October, 1775. 

HUMAN nature with all its infirmities and depravation 
is still capable of great things. It is capable of at 
taining to degrees of wisdom and of goodness, which, 
we have reason to believe, appear respectable in the 
estimation of superior intelligences. Education makes 
a greater difference between man and man, than na 
ture has made between man and brute. The virtues 
and powers to which men may be trained, by early 
education and constant discipline, are truly sublime 
and astonishing. Newton and Locke are examples 
of the deep sagacity which may be acquired by long 
habits of thinking and study. Nay, your common me 
chanics and artisans are proofs of the wonderful dex 
terity acquired by use ; a watchmaker, in. finishing 
his wheels and springs, a pin or needlemaker, &c. I 
think there is a particular occupation in Europe, 
which is called a paper-stainer or linen-stainer. A 
man who has been long habituated to it, shall sit for 
a whole day, and draw upon paper fresh figures to be 
imprinted upon the papers for rooms, as fast as his 
eye can roll, and his fingers move, and no two of his 



LETTERS. 73 

draughts shall be alike. The Saracens, the Knights 
of Malta, the army and navy in the service of the 
English republic, among many others, arc instances 
to show, to what an exalted height valor or bravery 
or courage may be raised, by artificial means. 

It should be your care, therefore, and mine, to ele 
vate the minds of our children and exalt their cour 
age ; to accelerate and animate their industry and 
activity ; to excite in them an habitual contempt of 
meanness, abhorrence of injustice and inhumanity, 
and an ambition to excel in every capacity, faculty 
and virtue. If we suffer their minds to grovel and 
creep in infancy, they will grovel all their lives. 

But their bodies must be hardened, as well as their 
souls exalted. Without strength and activity and 
vigor of body, the brightest mental excellencies will 
be eclipsed and obscured. 



LETTER XXXVIII. 



[Philadelphia], 29 October, 1775. 

THERE is in the human breast, a social affection, which 
extends to our whole species, faintly indeed, but in 
some degree. The nation, kingdom or community 
to which we belong is embraced by it more vigor 
ously. It is stronger still towards the province to 
which we "Belong, and in which we had our birth. It 



74 LETTEHS. 

is stronger and stronger as we descend to the county, 
town, parish, neighbourhood and family, which we call 
our own. And here we find it often so powerful, as 
to become partial, to blind our eyes, to darken our 
understandings, and pervert our wills. 

It is to this infirmity in my own heart, that I must 
perhaps attribute that local attachment, that partial 
fondness, that overweening prejudice in favor of New 
England, which I feel very often, and which, I fear, 
sometimes leads me to expose myself to just ridicule. 

New England has, in many respects, the advantage 
of every other colony in America, and, indeed, of 
every other part of the world that I know any thing 
of. * 

1. The people are purer English blood ; less mixed 
with Scotch, Irish, Dutch, French, Danish, Swedish, 
&c., than any other ; and descended from English 
men too, who left Europe in purer times than the 
present, and less tainted with corruption than those 
they left behind them. 

2. The institutions in New England for the support 
of religion, morals and decency exceed any other ; 
obliging every parish to have a minister, and every 
person to go to meeting, &c. 

3. The public institutions in New England for the 
education of youth, supporting colleges at the pub 
lic expense, and obliging towns to maintain grammar 
schools, are not equalled, and never were, in any part 
of the world. 

4. The division of our territory, that is, our coun 
ties, into townships ; empowering towns to assemble, 



LETTERS. 75 

choose officers, make laws, mend roads and twenty 
other things, gives every man an opportunity of show 
ing and improving that education, which he received 
at college or at school, and makes knowledge and 
dexterity at public business common. 

5. Our law for the distribution of intestate estates 
occasions a frequent division of landed property and 
prevents monopolies of hind. 

But in opposition to these we have labored under 
many disadvantages. The exorbitant prerogative 
of our Governors, &c., which would have overborne 
our liberties, if it had not been opposed by the five ^ 
preceding particulars.

mother. I wish she would not be concerned about 
me. She ought to consider, that a dysentery can kill 
as surely as a cannon. This town is as secure from 
the cannon and men of war as the moon is. I wish 
she had a little of your fortitude. I had rather be 
killed by a ball than live in such continual fears as 
she does. 

I can t write as often as I wish. I am engaged 
from seven in the morning till eleven at night 

Two pair of colors, belonging to the seventh regi 
ment, were brought here last night from Chambly, and 
hung up in Mrs. Hancock s chamber with great splen 
dor and elegance. That lady sends her compliments 
and good wishes. Among a hundred mea, almost, at 
this house, she lives and behaves with modesty, de 
cency, dignity and discretion, I assure you. Her 
behaviour is easy and genteel. She avoids talking 
upon politics. In large and mixed companies she is 
totally silent, as a lady ought to be ; but whether her 
eyes are so penetrating, and her attention so quick to 
the words, looks, gestures, sentiments, &c., of the 
company, as yours would be, saucy as you are this 
way, I won t say. 

But to resume a more serious subject You ask me 
to write to your father and sister, and my heart wishes 
and longs to do it, but you can have no conception 
what there is to prevent me. I really fear I shall

LETTER XL. 
[Philadelphia], 3 December, 1775, 

MY BEST FR1EXD, 

YOURS of November 12th 1 is before me. I wish I 
could write you every day, more than once, for 
although I have a number of friends and many rela 
tions, who are very dear to me, yet all the friendship 
I have for others is far unequal to that which warms 
my heart for you. The most agreeable time that I 
spend here is in writing to you, and conversing with

and of private affection must give place to that of duty 
and honor. Even private friendship and affections 
require it. 

I am obliged, by the nature of the service I am in, 
to correspond with many gentlemen, both of the army 
and of the two houses of Assembly, which takes up 
much of my time. How I find time to write half the 
letters I do, I know not, for my whole time seems en 
grossed with business. The whole Congress is taken 
up, almost, in different committees, from seven to ten 
in the morning. From ten to four or sometimes five, 
we are in Congress, and from six to ten, in committees 
again. I don t mention this to make you think me a 
man of importance, because it is not I alone," but the

whole Congress is thus employed, but to apologize for 
not writing to you oAener. 

Indeed 1 know not what to write that is worth your 
reading. I send you the papers, which inform you of 
what is public. As to what passes in Congress, I 
am tied fast by my honor to communicate nothing. I 
hope the Journal of the Session will be published 
soon, and then you will see what we have been about 
in one view, excepting what ought to be excepted. If 
I could visit the coffee-houses in the evening, and the 
coffee-tables of the ladies in the afternoon, I could 
entertain you with mary smart remarks upon dress 
and air, &c., and give you many sprightly conversa 
tions, but my fate, you know, is to be moping over 
books and papers all the leisure time I have, when I 
have any. 

I hope I shall be excused from coming to Philadel 
phia again, at least until other gentlemen have taken 
their turns. But I never will come here again without 
you, if I can persuade you to come with me. Whom

As to coming home I have no thoughts of it ; shall

now taking every day, so that I could not reconcile it 
to my own mind to be absent from this place at 
present. Nothing is expected from the Commission

The lories and timids pretend to expect great things

tion of other company, among whom were six or seven 
sachems and warriors of the French Caghnawaga 
Indians with several of their wives and children. A 
savage feast they made of it, yet were very polite in 
the Indian style. One of these sachems is an English 
man, a native of this colony, whose name was Wil 
liams, captivated in infancy with his mother, and 
adopted by seme kind squaw ; another, I think, is half 
French blood. 

I was introduced to them by the General, as one of 
the grand council fire at Philadelphia, which made 
them prick up their ears. They came and shook 
hands with me, and made me low bows and scrapes, 
&c. In short, I was much pleased with this day s 
entertainment. 

The General is to make them presents in clothes 
and trinkets. They have visited the lines at Cam 
bridge, and are going to see those at Roxbury. 

To-morrow we mount for the grand council fire, 
where I shall think often of my little brood at the 
foot of Pcnn s hill. Remember me particularly to 
each of the children. Tell them I charge them to be 
good, honest, active and industrious, for their own 
sakes as well as ours.

Philadelphia, 11 February, 177G. 

MY DEAR, 

HERE I am again. Arrived last Thursday, in good 
health, although I had a cold journey. The weather, 
a great part of the way, was very severe, which pre 
vented our making very quick progress. My com 
panion was agreeable and made the journey much 
less todious than it would have been. 

I can form no judgment of the state of public opin 
ions and principles here, as yet, nor any conjectures 
of what an hour may bring forth. 

Have been to meeting, and heard Mr. Duffield from 
Jeremiah ii. 17. " Hast thou not procured this unto 
thyseli, in that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, 
when he led thee by the way ? " He prayed very 
earnestly for Boston and New York, supposing the 
latter to be in danger of destruction. I, however, am 
not convinced that Vandcput will fire upon that town. 
It has too much Tory property to be destroyed by To 
ries. I hope it will be fortified and saved. If not, 
the question may be asked, " hast thou not procured 
this, &c ? " 

To-morrow Doctor Smith is to deliver an oration in 
honor of the brave Montgomery. I will send it, as 
soon as it is out, to you. There is a deep anxiety, a 
kind of thoughtful melancholy, and in some, a lowness 
of spirits approaching to despondency, prevailing

through the southern colonies, at present, very similar 
to what I have often observed in Boston, particularly 
on the first news of the port bill, and last year about . 

this time, or a little later, when the bad news arrived 
which dashed their fond hopes, with which they had 
deluded themselves through the winter. In this or a 
similar condition we shall remain, I think, until late in 
the spring, when some critical event will take place, 
perhaps sooner. But the arbiter of events, the sove 
reign of the world only knows, which way the torrent 
will be turned. Judging by experience, by probabili 
ties and by all appearances, I conclude, it will roll on 
to dominion and glory, though the circumstances and 
consequences may be bloody. 

In such great changes and commotions, individuals 
are but atoms. It is scarcely worth while to consider 
what the consequences will be to us. What will be 
the effects upon present and future millions, and mil 
lions of millions, is a question very interesting to be 
nevolence, natural and Christian. God grant they 
may, and I firmly believe they will, be happy.

Sterling was there before with his regiment, so that 
there will be nbout a thousand men with Lee from 
Connecticut, about six hundred with Lord Sterling 
from the Jerseys, one battalion of about seven hun 
dred and twenty minute men from Jersey, and one of 
the same number from Philadelphia. We shall soon 
have four battalions more, raised in Pennsylvania, to 
march to the same place, and one more in the Jer 
seys. Mr. Dickinson being the first Colonel and 
Commander of the first battalion too, churned it as his 
right to march upon this occasion. Mr. Heed, form 
erly General Washington s Secretary, goes his lieu 
tenant colonel. Mr. Dickinson s alacrity and spirit 
upon this occasion, which certainly becomes his char 
acter, and sets a fine example, is much talked of and 
applauded. This afternoon, the four battalions of the 
militia were together, and Mr. Dickinson mounted the 
rostrum to harangue them, which he did with great 
vehemence and pathos, as it is reported. 

I suppose, if I could have made interest enough to 
have been chosen more^ than a lieutenant, I should 
march too, upon some such emergency ; and possibly 
a contingency may happen, when it will be propeF 
for me to do it still, in rank and file. I will not fail to 
march, if it should. In the beginning of a war,, in 
colonies like this and Virginia, where the martial spirit 
is but just awakened, and the people are unaccustomed 
to arms, it may be proper and necessary for such 
popular orators as Henry and Dickinson to assume a 
military character* But I really think them both bet 
ter statesmen than soldiers, though I cannot say they.. 
arc not very good in the latter character. Hen-

I feel, upon some of these occasions, a flow of spi 
rits and an effort of imagination, very like an ambi 
tion to be engaged in the more active, gay, and dan 
gerous scenes ; (dangerous, I say, but recall that word, 
for there is no course more dangerous than that which 
1 am in.) I have felt such passions all my lifetime, 
particularly in the year 1757, when I longed more 
ardently to be a soldier, than I ever did to be a law* 
yer. But I am too old, and too much worn with fa 
tigues of study in my youth, and there is too little 
need, in my Province, of such assistance, for me to as

which there is reason to expect, that the further en 
croachments of tyranny and depredations of oppression 
will soon make the common faith ; unless the cunning 
ministry, by proposing negotiations and terms of re 
conciliation, should divert the present current from its 
channel. 

Reconciliation if practicable, and peace if attainable, 
you very well know, would be as agreeable to my in 
clinations, and as advantageous to my interest, as to 
any man s. ButJ sec no prospect, no probability, no 
possibility. And I cannot but despise the understand 
ing, which sincerely expects an honorable peace, for 
its credulity, and detest the hypocritical heart, which 
pretends to expect it, when in truth it does not. The 
newspapers here arc full of free speculations, the 
tendency of which you will easily discover. The 
writers reason from topics which have been long in 
contemplation and fully understood by the people at 
large in New England, but have been attended to in 
the southern colonies only by gentlemen of free spirits 
and liberal minds, who are very few. I shall en 
deavour to enclose to you as many of the papers and 
pamphlets as I can, as long as I stay here. Some 
will go by this conveyance. 

Dr. Franklin, Mr. Chase, and Mr. Charles Carroll of 
Carrollton in Maryland, are chosen a committee to go 
into Canada. The characters of the two first you

and learning, complete master of the French lan 
guage, and a professor of the Roman Catholic reli 
gion, yet a warm, a firm, a zealous supporter of the 
rights of America, in whose cause he has hazarded 
his all. Mr. John Carroll, of Maryland, a Roman 
Catholic priest and a Jesuit, is to go with the commit 
tee ; the priests in Canada having refused baptism and 
absolution to our friends there. General Lee is to 
command in that country, whose address, experience 
and abilities, added to his fluency in the French lan 
guage, will give him great advantages. 

The events of war are uncertain. We cannot en 
sure success, but we can deserve it. I am happy in 
this provision for that important department, because 
I think it the best that could be made in our circum 
stances. Your prudence will direct you to communi 
cate the circumstances of the priest, the Jesuit, and the 
Romish religion, only to such persons as can judge of 
the measure upon large and generous principles, and 
will not indiscreetly divulge it. The step was neces 
sary, for the anathemas of the church are very terri 
ble to our friends in Canada. 

I wish I understood French as well as you. I 
would have gone to Canada, if I had. I feel the want 
of education every day, particularly of that language. 
I pray, my dear, that you would not suffer your sons 
or your daughter ever to feel a similar pain. It is in 
your power to teach them French, and I, every day, 
see more and more, that it will become a necessary 
accomplishment of an American gentleman or lady.

LETTER XLV. 

Philadelphia, 17 March, 177(7. 

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 

OUR worthy friend, Frank Dana, arrived here last eve 
ning from New York, to which place he came lately 
from England in the packet. In company with him 
is a gentleman by the name of Wrixon, who has been 
a field officer in the British army, served all the last 
war in Germany, and has seen service in every part 
of Europe. He left the army some time ago, and 
studied law in the temple, in which science he made 
a great proficiency. He wrote, lately, a pamphlet un 
der the title of " the Rights of Britons," which he has 
brought over with him. He is a friend of liberty, and 
thinks justly of the American question. He has great 
abilities, as well as experience in the military science, 
and is an able engineer. I hope we shall employ 
him. 



88 LETTERS. 

The Baron de Woedtke we have made a Brigadier 
General, and ordered him to Canada. The testimo 
nials in his favor I shall enclose to you. Mr. Dana s t 
account, with which Mr. Wrixon s agrees, ought to 
extinguish, in every mind, all hopes of reconciliation 
with Great Britain. This delusive hope has done us 
great injuries, and if ever we are ruined, will be the 
cause of our fall. A hankering after the leeks of 
Egypt makes us forget the cruelty of her task mas 
ters. 

I shall suffer many severe pains on your account 
for some days. By a vessel from Salem a cannon 
ade was heard from dark till nine o clock, last night 
was a week ago. Your vicinity to such scenes of 
carnage and desolation as, I fear, are now to be seen 
in Boston and its environs, will throw you into much 
distress, but I believe in my conscience, I feel more 
here than you do. The sound of cannon was not 
so terrible, when I was at Braintree, as it is here, 
though I hear it at four hundred miles distance. 

You can *t imagine what a mortification I sustain in 
not having received a single line from you since we 
parted. I suspect some villany in conveyance. By the 
relation of Mr. Dana, Mr. Wrixon and Mr. Temple, 
Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Sewall and their associates are in 
great disgrace in England. Persons are ashamed to 
be seen to speak to them. They look despised and 
sunk. 

I shall enclose an extract of a letter from Mons. Du- 
bourg in Paris, and a testimonial in favor of our Prus 
sian General 

Adieu.

[Philadelphia], 19 March, 1776. 

YESTERDAY I had the long expected and much wished 
pleasure of a letter from you, of various dates from 
the 2d to the 10th March. 1 This is the first line I have 
received since I left you. 1 wrote you from Water- 
town, I believe, relating my feast at the Quarter Mas 
ter General s with the Caghnawaga Indians, and from 
Framingham, an account of the ordnance there, and 
from New York I sent you a pamphlet. Hope you re 
ceived these. Since I arrived here, I have written 
to you as often as I could. 

I am much pleased with your caution in your let 
ter, in avoiding names both of persons and places, or 
any other circumstances, which might designate to 
strangers the writer, or the person written to, or the 
persons mentioned. Characters and description will 
do as well. 

The lie which, you say, occasioned such disputes at 
the tavern, was curious enough. Who could make 
and spread it ? I am much obliged to an uncle for 
his friendship. My worthy fellow citizens may be 
easy about me. I never can forsake what I take to 
be their interests. My own have never been consid 
ered by me in competition with theirs. My ease, my

some keen attempts upon the passions, in this pam

of the difficulty of a reconciliation with Great Britain,

continental government are not much applauded. In 
deed this writer 1 lias a better hand in pulling down 
than building. It has been very generally propagated

our people had taken possession of Nook s hill at the 
same time when they got the other heights, and before 
the militia was dismissed. 

Poor cousin I I pity him. How much soever he 
may lament certain letters, 1 1 don t lament. I never 
repent of what was no sin. Misfortunes may he borne 
without whining. But if I can believe Mr. Dana, those 
letters were much admired in England. I can t help 
laughing when I write it, because they were really 
such hasty crude scraps. If I could have foreseen 
their fate, they should have been fit to be seen, and 
worth all the noise they have made. Mr. Dana says 
they were considered in England as containing a com 
prehensive idea of what was necessary to be done, 
and as showing resolution enough to do it. Wretched 
stuff as they really were, according to him they have 
contributed somewhat towards making certain persons 
to be thought the greatest statesmen in the world. So 
much for vanity. 

My love, duty, respects and compliments wherever 
they belong. Virginia will be well defended. So 
will New York. So will South Carolina. America 
will, ere long, raiso her voice aloud and assume a 
bolder air.

[Philadelphia], 29 March, 1776 

I GIVE you joy of Boston and Charlestown, once more 
the habitation of Americans. I am waiting with great 
impatience for letters from you, which I know, will 
contain many particulars. We are taking precautions 
to defend every place that is in danger, the Caroli- 
nas, Virginia, New York, Canada. I can think of 
nothing but fortifying Boston harbor. I want more 
cannon than are to be had. I want a fortification 
upon Point Alderton, one upon Lovell s Island, one 
upon George s Island, several upon Long Island, 
one upon the Moon, one upon Squantum. I want to 
hear of half a dozen fire ships, and two or three hun 
dred fire rafts prepared. I want to hear of row-galleys, 
floating batteries built, and booms laid across the 
channel in the narrows, and Vaisseaux de Prise 
sunk in it I wish to hear that you are translating 
Braintree commons into the channel. No efforts, no 
expense are too extravagant for me to wish for, to forti 
fy that harbor so as to make it impregnable. I hope \* 
every body will join and work until it is done. 

We have this week lost a very valuable friend of 
the colonies in Governor Ward, of Rhode Island, by 
the small pox in the natural way. He never would

vising him to be inoculated, ever since the first Con

bers, who have been inoculated, have gone through 
this distemper without any danger, or even confine 
ment, but nothing w&lt;?uld do. He must take it in the 
natural way, and die. 5 He was an amiable and a sen 
sible man, a steadfast friend to his country upon very 
pure principles. His funeral was attended with the 
same solemnities as Mr. Randolph s. Mr. Stillman 
being the Anabaptist minister here, of which persua 
sion was the Governor, was desired by Congress to

sort of defence Virginia can make ?* I believe they 
will make an able defence. Their militia and minute 
.ve been some time employed in training them 
selves, and they have nine battalions of regulars, as 
they call them, maintained among them, under good 
officers, at the continental expense. They have set up a 
number of manufactories of fire-arms, which are

powder, and are successful and assiduous in making 
saltpetre. Their neighbouring sister, or rather daugh 
ter colony of North Carolina, which is a warlike 
colony, and has several battalions at the continental 
expense, as well as a pretty good militia, are ready to 
assist them, and they are in very good spirits and 
seem determined to make a brave resistance. The 
gentry are very rich, and the common people very 
poor. This inequality of property gives an aristocrat- 
ical turn to all their proceedings, and occasions a 
strong aversion in their patricians, to Common 
Sense. 1 But the spirit of these Barons is coming 
down and it must submit. It is very true, as you ob 
serve, they have been duped by Dunmore. But 
this is a common case. All the colonies are duped, 
more or less, at one time and another. A more egre 
gious bubble was never blown up, than the story of 
Commissioners coming to treat with the Congress, yet 
it has gained credit like a charm, not only with, but 
against, the clearest evidence. I never shall forget 
the delusion which seized 6ur best and most sagacious 
friends, the dear inhabitants of Boston, the winter be 
fore last. Credulity and the want of foresight are 
imperfections in the human character, that no politi 
cian can sufficiently guard against.

certain house in Queen street. I had burned it long 
ago in imagination. It rises now to my view like a

sisters. I wish I could be clear that it is no moral 
evil to pity him and his lady. Upon repentance, they 
will certainly have a large share in the compassions of 
many. But let us take warning, and give it to our 
children. Whenever vanity and gaiety, a love of 
pomp and dress, furniture, equipage, buildings, great 
company, expensive diversions and elegant entertain 
ments get the better of the principles and judgments 
of men or women, there is no knowing where they 
will stop, nor into what evils, natural, moral or politi

the husbands. Remember, all men would be tyrants, if they 
could. If particular care and attention are not paid to the 
ladies, WP are determined to foment a rebellion, and will not 
hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice 
or representation."

LETTER L. 



Philadelphia, 15 April, 1776. 

I SEND you every newspaper that comes out, and I 
send you, now and then, a few sheets of paper, but 
this article is as scarce here, as with you. I would 
send a quire, if I could get a conveyance. 

I write you now and then a line, as often as I can, 
but I can tell you no news, but what I send in the 
public papers. 

We are waiting, it is said, for commissioners; a 
messiah that will never come. This story of commis 
sioners is as arrant an illusion as ever was hatched 
in the brain of an enthusiast, a politician, or a maniac. 
I have laughed at it, scolded at it, grieved at it, and I 
don t know but I may, at an unguarded moment, have 
rip d at it But it is vain to reason against such de 
lusions. I was very sorry to see, in a letter from the 
General, that he had been bubbled with it ; and still 
more, to see, in a letter from my sagacious friend, 
W. 1 at Plymouth, that he was taken in too. 

My opinion is, that the commissioners and the com 
mission have been here, (I mean in America,) these 
two months. The Governors, Mandamus Council 
lors, Collectors and Comptrollers and Commanders of 
the army and navy, I conjecture, compose the list,

and their power is to receive submissions. But \ve are 
not in a very submissive mood. They will get no ad- 
vantage of us. We shall go on to perfection, I be 
lieve. I have been very busy for some time ; have 
written about ten sheets of paper, with my own hand, 
about some trifling affairs, 1 which I may mention some 
time or other not now, for fear of accidents. 

What will come of this labor, time will discover. 
I shall get nothing by it, I believe, because I never 
get anything by anything that I do. I am sure the 
public or posterity ought to get something. I believe 
my children will think I might as well have thought 
and labored a little, night and day, for their benefit. 
Hut I will not bear the reproaches of my children. I 
will tell them, that I studied and labored to procure a 
free constitution of government for them to solace 
themselves under, and if they do not prefer this to am 
ple fortune, to case and elegance, they are not my 

( --children, and I care not what becomes of them. They 

shall live upon thin diet, wear mean clothes, and work 
hard with cheerful hearts and free spirits, or they may 
be the children of the earth, or of no one, for me. 

John has genius and so has Charles. Take care 
that they don t go astray. Cultivate their minds, in

attention upon great and glorious objects. Root out

them great and manly. Teach them to acorn injus 
tice, ingratitude, cowardice and falsehood. Let them 
revere nothing hut religion, morality and liberty. 

Abhy and Tommy are not forgotten by me al 
though I did not mention them before. The first, by 
reason of her sex, requires a different education from 
the two I have mentioned. Of this, you are the only 
judge. I want to send each of my little pretty flock 
some present or other. I have walked over this city 
twenty times, and gaped at every shop, like a coun 
tryman, to find something, but could not. Ask every 
one of them what they would choose to have, and 
write it to me in your next letter. From this I shall 
judge of their taste and fancy and discretion. 



LETTER LI. 

[Philadelphia], 23 April, 1776. 

THIS is St. George s day, a festival celebrated by the 
English, as St. Patrick s is by the Irish, St. David s 
by the Welsh, and St. Andrew s by the Scotch. The 
natives of Old England in this city, heretofore formed 
a society, which they called St. George s club or St. 
George s society. Upon the twenty-third of April, 
annually, they had a great feast. But the Tories and 
politics have made a schism in the society, so that one 
part of them are to meet and dine at the City Tavern,

and the other nt the Bunch of Grapes Israel Ja- 
cobs s, and a third party go out of town. One set are 
stanch Americans, another stanch Britons, and a 
third, halfway men, neutral beings, moderate men, 
prudent, folks, for such is the division among men upon 
all occasions and cverj r question. This is the account 
which I have from my barber, who is one of the so 
ciety, and zealous on the side of America, and one of 
the Philadelphia Associators. 

This curious character of a barber, I have a great 
inclination to draw, for your amusement. He is a lit 
tle dapper fellow, short and small, but active and 
lively. A tongue as fluent and voluble as you please, 
wit at will, and a memory or an invention which never 
leaves him at a loss for a story to tell you for your 
entertainment. ITc has seen great company. He 
has dressed hair and shaved faces at Bath, and at 
Court. He is acquainted with several of the nobility 
and gentry, particularly Sir William Meredith. He 
married a girl, the daughter of a Quaker in this place, 
of whom he tells many droll stories. He is a serjeant 
in one of the companies of some battalion or other 
here. He frequents, of evenings, a beer house kept by 
one Weaver in the city, where he has many curious 
disputes and adventures, and meets many odd char 
acters. 

I believe you will think me very idle to write you 
so trifling a letter, upon so uninteresting a subject, at 
a time when my country is fighting pro aris et focis. 
But I assure you I am glad to chat with this barber, 
while he is shaving and combing me, to divert myself

[Philadelphia], 28 April, 1776. 

YESTESDAT I received two letters from you from the 
7th to the 14th of April. It gives me concern to 
think of the many cares you must have upon your 
mind. Your reputation as a farmer or anything else 
you undertake, I dare answer for. Your partner s 
character as a statesman is much more problemati 
cal. 

As to my return, 1 have not a thought of it Jour-

neys of such a length are tedious, and expensive both 
of time and money, neither of which is my own. I 
hope to spend the next Christmas where I did the last, 
and after that, I hope to be relieved ; for by that time, 
I shall have taken a pretty good trick at helm, whether 
the vessel has been well steered or not. But if my 
countrymen should insist upon my serving them an 
other year, they must let me bring my whole family 
with me. Indeed, I could keep house here with my 
partner, four children and two servants as cheap as I 
maintain myself here with two horses and a servant 
at lodgings. 

Instead of domestic felicity, I am destined to public 
contentions. Instead of rural felicity, I must recon 
cile myself to the smoke and noise of a city. In the 
place of private peace, I must be distracted with the 
vexation of developing the deep intrigues of politi 
cians, and must assist in conducting the arduous op 
erations of war, and think myself well rewarded if my 
private pleasure and interests are sacrificed, as they 
ever have been and will be, to the happiness 
others. 

You tell me, our Jurors refuse to serve, because the 
writs are issued in the King s name. I am very glad 
to hear that they discover so much sense and spin 
I learn, from another letter, that the general court have 
left out of their bills the year of his reign, and that 
they are making a law, that the same name shall be 
left out of all writs, commissions, and all law pro 
cesses. This is good news too. The same will be 
the case in all the colonies, very soon.

You ask me, how I have done the winter past ? I 
have not enjoyed so good health as last fall But I 
have done complaining of anything. Of ill health, I 
have no right to complain, because it is given me by 
Heaven. Of meanness, of envy, of littleness, of , 
of , of , I have reason and right to complain, but 
I have too much contempt to use that right. There 
is such a mixture of folly, littleness and knavery in 
this world, that I am weary of it, and although I be* 
hold it with unutterable contempt and indignation, yet 
the public good requires that I should take no notice 
of it by word or by letter. And to this public good I 
will conform. 

You will see an account of the fleet in some of the 
papers I have sent you. I give you joy of the Ad 
miral s success. I have vanity enough to take to my

heart throb, more than a cannonade would. You bid 
me burn your letters. But I must forget you first

If any one wants a vote for a commission he vouch

Pray keep me constantly informed what ships are in 
the harbor and whaK fortifications are going on. I 
am quite impatient to near of more vigorous measures 
for fortifying Boston harbor. Not a moment should be 
neglected. Every man ought to go down, as they did 
after the battle of Lexington, and work until it is done. 
I would willingly pay half a dozen hands myself, and 
subsist them, rather than it should not be done imme 
diately. It is of more importance than to raise corn. 
You say enclosed is a prologue and a parody, but nei

and an end to royal style, titles and authority. Such 
mighty revolutions make a deep impression on the 
minds of men, and set many violent passions at work.

LETTER LIII. 



[Philadelphia], 12 May, 177G. 

YOURS of 21 April came to hand yesterday. I send 
you regularly every newspaper, and write as often as 
I can ; but I feel more skittish about writing than I 
did, because, since the removal of head-quarters to 
New York, we have no express, and very few indi 
vidual travellers ; and the post I am not quite confi 
dent in ; however, I shall write as I can. 

What shall I do with my office ? I want to resign 
it for a thousand reasons. Would you advise me ? 

There has been a gallant battle in Delaware river 
between the galleys and two men of war, the 
Roebuck and Liverpool, in which the men of war 
came off second best ; which has diminished, in the 
minds of the people on both sides of the river, the ter 
ror of a man of war. 

I long to hear a little of my private affairs ; yet I 
dread it too, because I know you must be perplexed 
and distressed. I wish it was in my power to relieve 
you. It gives me great pleasure to learn, that our 
rulers are, at last, doing something towards the forti 
fication of Boston. But I am inexpressibly chagrined 
to find that the enemy is fortifying on George s Island. 
I never shall be easy, until they are completely driven 
out of that harbor, and effectually prevented from ever 
getting in again. As you are a politician and now 



108 LETTERS. 

elected into an important office, that of judgess of the 
Tory ladies, which will give you, naturally, an influ 
ence with your sex, I hope you will be instant, in sea 
son and out of season, in exhorting them to use 
their influence with the gentlemen, to fortify upon 
George s Island, LovelFs, Pettick s, Long, or wherever 
else it is proper. Send down fire ships and rafts, and 
burn to ashes those pirates. I am out of patience with 
the languid, lethargic councils of the province, at such 
a critical, important moment, puzzling their heads 
about twopenny fees, and confession bills, and what 
not, when the harbor of Boston is defenceless. If I 
was there, I should storm and thunder like Demos 
thenes, or scold like a tooth-drawer. Do ask Mr. 
Wibird and Mr. Weld and Mr. Taft to preach about 
it. I am ashamed, vexed, angry to the last degree. 
Our people, by their turpitude, have invited the ene 
my to come to Boston again, and I fear they will have 
the civility and politeness to accept the invitation. 

Your uncle has never answered my letter. Thank 
the Doctor, he has written me a most charming letter, 
full of intelligence, and very sensible and useful re 
marks. I will pay the debt, as far as my circumstan 
ces will admit, and as soon. But I hope my friends 
will not wait for regular returns from me. I have not 
yet left off pitying " the fifty or sixty men ; " and if 
my friends knew all that I do, they would pity too. 

Betsey Smith, lazy hussy, has not written me a 
line a great while. I wish she was married ; then 
she would have some excuse. Duty to papa. Love 
to all. How is the family over against the church ?

LETTER L1V. 



[Philadelphia], 17 May, 1776. 

I HAVE this morning heard Mr. Duffield, upon the signs 
of the times. He ran a parallel between the case of 
Israel, and that of America ; and between the con 
duct of Pharaoh, and that of George. Jealousy that 
the Israelites would throw off the government of 
Egypt made him issue his edict, that the midwives 
should cast the children into the river, and the other 
edict, that the men should make a large revenue of 
bricks without straw. He concluded, that the course 
of events indicated strongly the design of Providence, -* 
that we should be separated from Grcut Britain, &c. 
Is it not a saying of Moses, " who am I, that I 
should go in and out before this great people ? " 
When I consider the great events which are passed, 
and those greater which ore rapidly advancing, and 
that I may have been instrumental in touching some 
springs, and turning some small wheels, which have 
had and will have such effects, I feel an awe upon my 
mind, which is not easily described. Great Britain 
has at last driven America to the last step, a com 
plete separation from her; a total absolute indepen 
dence, not only of her Parliament, but of her crown, / 
for such is the amount of the resolve of the 15th. 1 Con- ^J

of the whole, a resolve that the colonies should form govern-

federation among ourselves, or alliances with foreign 
nations are not necessary to a perfect separation from 
Britain. That is effected by extinguishing all author 
ity under the crown, Parliament, and nation, as the 
resolution for instituting governments has done, to all 
intents and purposes. Confederation will be necessary 
for our internal concord, and alliances may be so for 
^jour external defence. 

I have reasons to believe that no colony, which shall 
assume a government under the people, will give it 
up. There is something very unnatural and odious in a 
government a thousand leagues off. A whole gov 
ernment of our own choice, managed by persons whom 
we love, revere, and can confide in, has charms in 
it, for which men will fight Two young gentlemen 
from South Carolina in this city, who were in Charles- 
town when their new constitution was promulgated, 
and when their new Governor and Council and Assem- 

. Brents independent of the crown. The shape in which this 
proposition was adopted on the tenth, was a recommendation to 
the respective assemblies and conventions of the united colo

company of cadets, light horse, &c., told me, that 
they were beheld by the people with transports and 
tears of joy. The people gazed at them with a kind 
of rapture. They both told me, that the reflection, 
that these were gentlemen whom they all loved, 
esteemed and revered, gentlemen of their own choice, 
whom they could trust, and whom they could displace, 
if any of them should behave amiss, affected them 
so, that they could not help crying... They say, their 
people will never give up this government. One of 
these gentlemen is a relation of yours, a Mr. Smith, 
son of Mr. Thomas Smith. I shall give him this let 
ter or another to you. 

A privateer fitted out here by Colonel Roberdeau 
and Major Bayard since our resolves for privateering, 
I am this moment informed, has taken a valuable 
prize. This is encouragement at the beginning. 

In one or two of your letters, you remind me to 
think of you as I ought. Bo assured, there is not an 
hour of the day, in which I don t think of you as I 
ought, that is, with every sentiment of tenderness, 
esteem and admiration.

[Philadelphia], 22 Maj, 1776. 

WHEN a man is seated in the midst of forty people, 
some of whom are talking, and others whispering, it is 
not easy to think what is proper to write. I shall 
send you the newspapers, which will inform you of 
public affairs, and the particular flickerings of parties 
in this colony. I am happy to learn from your let 
ter, that a flame is at last raised among the people, 
for the fortification of the harbor. Whether Nan- 
tasket or Point Alderton would be proper posts to be 
taken, I can t say. But I would fortify every place 
which is proper, and which cannon could be obtained 
for. Generals Gates and Mifflin are now here: Gen 
eral Washington will be here to-morrow, when we 
shall consult and deliberate concerning the operations 
of the ensuing campaign. 

We have dismal accounts from Europe of the pre 
parations against us. This summer will be very im 
portant to us. We shall have a severe trial of our 
patience, fortitude and perseverance. But I hope we 
shall do valiantly, and tread down our enemies. 

I have some thoughts of petitioning the General 
Court for leave to bring my family here. I am a 
lonely, forlorn creature here. It used to be some 
comfort to me, that I had a servant and some horses. 
They composed a sort of family for me. But now, 



i 



LETTERS. 113 

there is not one creature here, that I seem to have 
any kind of relation to. It is a cruel reflection, which 
very often comes across me, that I should be separated 
so far from those babes, whose education and welfare 
lie so near my heart. But greater misfortunes than 
these must not divert us from superior duties. 

Your sentiments of the duties we owe to our coun 
try arc such as become the best of women and the 
best of men. Among all the disappointments and 
perplexities which have fallen to my share in life, 
nothing has contributed so much to support my rnind, 
as the choice blessing of a wife, whose capacity ena 
bled her to comprehend, and whose pure virtue 
obliged her to approve the views of her husband. 
This has been the cheering consolation of my heart 
in my most solitary, gloomy and disconsolate 
hours. In this remote situation, I am deprived in a 
great measure of this comfort. Yet I read and read 
again your charming letters, and they serve me, in 
some faint degree, as a substitute for the company 
and conversation of the writer. I want to take a walk 
with you in the garden, to go over to the common, 
the plain, the meadow. I want to take Charles in one 
hand and Tom in the other, and walk with you, Abby 
on your right hand, and John upon my left, to view 
the corn fields, the orchards, &c. 

Alas, poor imagination ! how faintly an&lt;J imper 
fectly do you supply the want of originality and real 
ity. But instead of those pleasing scenes of domes 
tic life, I hope you will not be disturbed with the 
alarms of war. I hope, yet I fear.

[Philadelphia], 27 May, 1776. 

I HAVE three 1 of your favors before me. One of 
May 7, another of May 9, and a third of May 14th. 
The last has given me relief from many anxieties. It 
relates wholly to private affairs, and contains such an 
account of wise and prudent management, as makes 
me very happy. I begin to be jealous, that our neigh 
bors will think affairs more discreetly conducted in my 
absence, than at any other time. Whether your sus 
picions concerning a letter under a marble cover are 
just or not, it is best to say little about it It is a 
hasty,* hurried thing, and of no great consequence, 
calculated for a meridian at a great distance from 
New England. If it has done no good, it will do 
no harm. It has contributed to set people thinking 
upon the subject, and in this respect has answered its 
end. The manufacture of governments having, since 
the publication of that letter, been as much talked of, 
as that of saltpetre was before. 

I rejoice at your account of the spirit of fortifica 
tion, and the good effects of it I hope, by this time, 
you are in a tolerable posture of defence. The in 
habitants of Boston have done themselves great honor 
by their laudable zeal, the clergymen, especially.

I think you shine as a stateswoman of late, as well as 
a farmeress. Pray where do you get your maxims of 
state ? They are very apropos. I am much obliged 
to Judge Gushing and his lady for their polite visit to 
you. I should be very happy to see him, and con 
verse with him about many things, but cannot hope 
for that pleasure very soon. The afiairs of America 
are in so critical a state, such great events are strug 
gling into birth that I must not quit this station at this 
time. Yet I dread the melting heats of a Philadel 
phia summer, and know not how my frail constitution 
will endure it. Such constant care, such incessant 
application of mind, drinking up and exhausting the 
finer spirits, upon which life and health so essentially 
depend, will wear away a stronger man than I am. 
Yet I will not shrink from this danger or this toil. 
While my health shall be such, that I can discharge, 
-in any tolerable manner, the duties of this important 
post, I will not desert it. 

I am pleased to hear that the superior court is to 
sit at Ipswich in June. This will contribute to give 
stability to the government, I hopc^ift all its branches. 
But I presume other steps will be taken for this pur 
pose. A Governor, and Lieutenant Governor, I hope, 
will be chosen, and the Constitution a little more fixed. 
I hope too, that the council will, this year, be more 
full, and augmented by the addition of good men. I 
hope Mr. Bowdoin will be Governor, if his health will 
permit, and Doctor Winthrop, Lieutenant Governor. 
These are wise, learned and prudent men. The first 
has a great fortune and wealthy connexions. The

other has the advantage of a name and family which 
is much reverenced, besides his personal abilities and 
virtues, which are very great. ; 

Our friend, 1 I sincerely hope, will not refuse his 
appointment. For although I have ever thought that 
bench should be filled from the bar, and once labored 
successfully to effect it, yet as the gentlemen have seen 
fit to decline, I know of no one who would do 
more honor to the station, than my friend. None 
would be so agreeable to me, whether I am to sit by 
him or before him. I suppose it must be disagreeable 
to him and his lady, because he loves to be upon his 
farm, and they both love to be together. But you 
must tell them of a couple of their friends, who are as 
fond of living together, who are obliged to sacrifice 
their rural amusements and domestic happiness to the 
requisitions of the public. 

The Generals, Washington, Gates and Mifllin are all 
here, and we shall derive spirit, unanimity and vigor 
from their presence and advice. I hope you will have 
some general officers at Boston soon. I am, with con 
stant wishes and prayers for your health and pros 
perity, forever yours.

LETTER LVII. 



\ [Philadelphia], 2 June, 177C. 

YESTERDAY I dined with Captain Richards, the gentle 
man who made me the present of the brass pistols. 
We had cherries, strawberries and green peas in plenty. 
The fruits are three weeks earlier here, than with 
you. Indeed, they arc a fortnight earlier on the east, 
than on the west side of Delaware river. We have 
hadgreen peas this week past, but they were brought 
over the river, from New Jersey, to this market. 
There are none grown in the city, or on the west side 
of the river yet. The reason is, the soil of New Jer 
sey is a warm sand ; that of Pennsylvania a cold clay. 
So much for peas and berries. 

Now for something of more importance. In all the 
correspondence I have maintained, during a course 
of twenty years, at least, that I have been a writer of 
letters, I never kept a single copy. This negligence 
and inaccuracy has been a great misfortune to me on 
many occasions. I have now purchased a folio book, 
in the first page of which, excepting one blank leaf, I 
am writing this letter, and intend to write all my let 
ters to you in it, from this time forward. This will 
be an advantage to me in several respects. In the 
first place, I shall write more deliberately. In the 
second place, I shall be able, v at all times, to review 
what I have written. Third, I shall know how often 



118 LETTERS. 

I write. Fourth, I shall discover by this means, whether 
any of toy letters to you miscarry. If it were possi 
ble for me to find a conveyance, I would send you 
such another blank book as a present, that you might 
begin the practice at the same time, for I really think 
that your letters are much better worth preserving 
than mine. Your daughter and sons will very soon 
write so good hands, that they will copy the letters 
for you from your book, which will improve them, at 
the same time that it relieves you. 



LETTER LVIII. 

[Philadelphia], 16 June, 1776. 

YESTERDAY was to me a lucky day, as it brought me 
two letters from you. One dated May 27, and the 
other June 3d. Don t be concerned about me, if it 
happens now and then, that you don t hear from me 
for some weeks together. If anything should injure 
my health materially, you will soon hear of it. But 
I thank God, I am in much better health than I ex 
pected to be. But this cannot last long under the 
load that I carry. When it becomes too great for my 
strength, I shall ask leave to lay it down, and come 
home. But I will bold it out a good while yet, if I 
can. 

I wish our uncle had as much ambition, as he has

virtue and ability. A deficiency of ambition is as 
criminal and injjrious as an excess of it. Tell him 
I say so. How shall we contrive to make so wise and 
good a man ambitious ? Is it not a sin lo be so mod 
est? Ask him how he can answer it? Thanks for 
your quotation from Sully. It is extremely apropos. 
I am very glad you are so well provided with help. 
Give my respects to Mr. Belcher and his family. Tell 
him I am obliged to him for his kind care of the farm. 
I wish I could go out with him, and see the business go 
on, but I can t. Thank your father and my mother 
for their kind remembrance of me. Return my duty 
to both. Charles s young heroism charms me. Kiss 
him. Poor Mugford, 1 yet glorious Mugford ! How 
beautiful and sublime it is to die for one s country ! 
What a fragrant memory remains ! 

The rumor you heard of General Gates will prove 
premature. I endeavoured both here and with the

it had not been for the loss of General Thomas. Cruel

1 A manifest allusion to the measures in progress for a Dec

LETTERS. 121 

June 2, and a few more June 16. These are all 
that I have written to you, since this month began. 
It has been the busiest month that ever I saw. I 
have found time to enclose all the newspapers, which 
I hope you will receive in due time. 

Our misfortunes in Canada are enough to melt a 
heart of stone. The small pox is ten times more 
terrible than Britons, Canadians and Indians, together. 
This was the cause of our precipitate retreat from 
Quebec. This the cause of our disgraces at the 
Cedars. I don t mean that this was all. There has 
been want approaching to famine, as well as pesti 
lence And these discouragements have so disheart 
ened our officers, that none of them seem to act with 
prudence and firmness. But these reverses of for 
tune don t discourage me. It was natural to expect 
them, and we ought to be prepared in our minds 
for greater changes, and more melancholy scenes 
still. It is an animating cause, and brave spirits are 
not subdued with difficulties. 

Amidst all our gloomy pr spects in Canada, we 
receive some pleasure from Boston. I congratulate 
you on your victory over your enemies in the har 
bor. This has long lain near my heart, and it gives 
me great pleasure to think that what was so much 
wished is accomplished. I hope our people will now 
make the lower harbor impregnable, and never 
again suffer the flag of a tyrant to fly within any 
part of it. 

The Congress have been pleased to give me more 
business than I am qualified for, and more than, 1 



122 LETTERS. 

fear, I can go through with safety to my health. 
They have established a board of war and ordnance, 
and made me President of it, 1 an honor to which I 
never aspired, a trust to which I feel myself vastly 
unequal. But I am determined to do as well as 1 can, 
and make industry supply, in some degree, the place 
of abilities and experience. The Board sits every 
morning and every evening. This with constant 
attendance in Congress will so entirely engross my 
time, that I fear, I shall not be able to write you so 
often as I have. But I will steal time to write to 
you. 

The small pox ! the small pox ! what shall we do 
with it ? I could almost wish that an inoculating Hos 
pital was opened in every town in New England, 
It is some small consolation that the scoundrel savages 
have taken a large dose of it. They plundered the 
baggage and stripped off the clothes of our men who 
had the small pox out full upon them at the Cedars. 

1 Besides his position on the Committee, appointed on the 
llth of June, to draught a Declaration of Independence, Mr. 
Adams had been chosen on the next day, one of a Committee 
to prepare a plan of treaties to be proposed to foreign powers, 
and on the day after that, Chairman of the board of war.

Philadelphia, 3 July, 177C. 

YOUR favor 1 of 17 June, dated at Plymouth, was 
handed me by yesterday s post. I was much pleased 
to find that you had taken a journey to Plymouth, to 
sec your friends, in the loni* absence of one, whom 
you may wish to see. The excursion will be an 
amusement, and will serve your health. How happy 
would it have made me to have taken this journey 
with you ! 

I was informed, a day or two before the receipt of 
your letter, that you was gone to Plymouth, by Mrs. 
Polly Palmer, who was obliging enough, in your ab 
sence, to send me the particulars of the expedition 
to the lower harbor against the men of war. Her 
narration is executed with a precision and perspicuity, 
which would have become the pen of an accomplish* 
ed historian. 

I am very glad you had so good an opportunity of 
seeing one of our little American men of war. 
Many ideas new to you must have presented them 
selves in such a scene ; and you will in future better 
I understand the relations of sea engagements. 

I rejoice extremely at Dr. Bulfincirs petition to 
open a Hospital. But I hope the business will be

done upon a larger scale. I hope that one Hospital 
will be licensed in every county, if not in every town. 
I am happy to find you resolved to be with the child 
ren in the first class. Mr. Whitney and Mrs. Katy 
Quincy are cleverly through inoculation in this city. 
The information you give me, of our friend s re 
fusing his appointment, has given me much pain, grief 
and anxiety. I believe I shall be obliged to follow 
his example. I have not fortune enough to support 
my family, and, what is of more importance, to sup 
port the dignity of that exalted station. It is too high 
and lifted up for me, who delight in nothing so much 
^.as retreat, solitude, silence and obscurity. In private 
C life, no one has a right to censure me for following 
\ my own inclinations in retirement, simplicity and fru 
gality. In public life, every man has a right to re 
mark as he pleases. At least he thinks so.

ever was debated in America, and a greater, perhaps, 
never was nor will be decided among men. A Res 
olution was passed without one dissenting Colony 
" that these United Colonies are, and of right ought 
to be, free and independent States, and as such they 
have, and of right ought to have, full power to make 
war, conclude peace, establish commerce and to do 
all other acts and things which other States may right 
fully do." You will see, in a few days, a Declara 
tion setting forth the causes which have impelled us 
to this mighty revolution, and the reasons which will 
justify it in the sight of God and man. A plan of . 
confederation will be taken up in a few days.

When I look back to the year 17G1 and recollect 
the argument concerning writs of assistance in the 
superior court, which I have hitherto considered as 
the commencement of this controversy between Great 
Britain and America, and run through the whole 
period, from that time to this, and recollect the series 
of political events, the chain of causes and effects, I 
am surprised at the suddenness, as well as greatness 
of this revolution. Britain has been filled with folly, 
and America with wisdom; at least, this is my judg 
ment. Time must determine. It is the will of Hea 
ven that the two countries should be sundered forever. 
It may be the will of Heaven that America shall suf 
fer calamities still more wasting, arid distresses yet 
more dreadful. If this is to be the case, it will have 
this good effect at least. It will inspire us with many 
virtues, which we have not, and correct many errors, 
follies and vices which threaten to disturb, dishonor, 
and destroy us. The furnace of affliction produces 
refinement in states as well as individuals. And the 
new Governments we arc assuming in every part 
will require a purification from our vices, and an 
augmentation of our virtues, or they will be no bless 
ings. The people ^ilLJwwe unbounded power, and 
the pe^pTe r ~5Te""extrernely addicted to corruption and 
venality, as well as the great. But I must submit 
all my hopes and fears to an overruling providence, 
in which, unfashionable as the faith may be, I firmly 
believe.

LETTER LIT. 



Philadelphia, 3 Julj, 1776. 

HAD a Declaration of Independency been made 
seven months ago, it would have been attended with 
many great and glorious effects. We might, before 
this hour, have formed alliances with foreign states. 
AVe should have mastered Quebec, and been in 
possession of Canada. You will perhaps wonder 
how such a declaration would have influenced our 
affairs in Canada, but if I could write with freedom, 
I could easily convince you that it would, and explain 
to you the manner how. Many gentlemen in high 
stations and of great influence, have been duped 
by the ministerial bubble of Commissioners to treat. 
And in real, sincere expectation of this event, which 
they so fondly wished, they have been slow and 
languid in promoting measures for the reduction of 
that province. Others there are in the Colonies who 
really wished that our enterprise in Canada would be 
defeated, that the Colonies might be brought into dan 
ger and distress between two fires, and be thus in 
duced to submit. Others really wished to defeat the 
expedition to Canada, lest the conquest of it should 
elevate the minds of the people too much to hearken 
to those terms of reconciliation, which, they believed, 
would be offered us. These jarring views, wishes 



LETTERS. 127 

and designs occasioned an opposition to many salutary 
measures, which were proposed for the support of 
that expedition, and caused obstructions, embarrass 
ments, and studied delays, which have finally lost us 
the province. 

All these causes however in conjunction would 
not have disappointed us, if it had not been for a 
misfortune which could not be foreseen, and perhaps, 
could not have been prevented I mean the preva 
lence of the small pox among our troops. This 
fatal pestilence completed our destruction. It is a 
frown of providence upon us, which we ought to lay 
to heart. 

But, on the other hand, the delay of this Declara 
tion to this time has many threat advantages attending 
it. The hopes of reconciliation, which were fondly 
entertained by multitudes of honest and well mean 
ing, though weak and mistaken people, have been 
gradually and, at last, totally extinguished. Time 
has been given for the whole people maturely to con* 
sider the great question of independence, and to ripen 
their judgment, dissipate their fears, and allure their 
hopes, by discussing it in newspapers and pamphlets, 
by debating it in assemblies, conventions, committees 
of safety and inspection, in town and county meetings, 
as well as in private conversations, so that the whole 
people, in every colony of the thirteen, have now 
adopted it as their own act. This will cement the 
union, and avoid those heats, and perhaps convulsions, 
which might have been occasioned by such a Decla- I 
ration, six months ago. 




128 LETTEM. 

But the day is past The second 1 day of July, 
1776, will be the most memorable epocha in the 
history of America. I am apt to believe that it will 
be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great 
anniversary Festival. It ought to be commemorated, 
as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devo 
tion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized 
with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, 
guns, bells, bonfires and illuminations, from one end 

1 The practice has been to celebrate the 4th of July, the 
day upon which the form of the declaration of Independence 
was agreed to, rather than the i?d, the day upon which the 
resolution, making that declaration, \ as determined upon by 
the Congress. A friend of Mr. Adams, who had during his 
lifetime an opportunity to read the two letters dated on the 3d, 
was so much struck with them, that he procured the liberty 
to publish them. But thinking, probably, that a slight altera 
tion woull belter fit them for the taste of the day, and gain for 
them a higher character for prophecy, thin if printed as they 
were, he obtained leave to put togethf r only the most re 
markable paragraphs, and make one letter out of the two. 
He then changed the date from the 3d to the 5th, and th 
word second to fourth, and published it, the public being 
made aware of these alterations. In this form, and as connect 
ed with the anniversary of our National Independence, these 
Jetters have, ever since, enjoyed great popularity. The Editor 
at first entertained some doubt of the expediency of mak 
ing a variation by printing them in their original shape. But 
upon considering the matter well, his determination to adhere, 
in all cases, to the text, prevailed. If any injury to the rep 
utation of Mr. Adams for prophecy should ensue, it will be 
greater in the form than in the substance, and will not be, 
perhaps, without compensation in the restoration of the un 
published portion.

You will think me transported with enthusiasm, but

I HAVE, this moment, folded up a magazine and an 
Evening Post, and sent them off by an express, who 
could not wait for me to write a single line. It always 
goes to my heart, to send off a packet of pamphlets 
and newspapers, wrthout a letter, but it sometimes 
unavoidably happens, and I suppose you had rather 
receive a pamphlet or newspaper, than nothing. 

The design of our enemy now seems to be, a pow 
erful invasion of New York and New Jersey. The 
Halifax fleet and army is arrived, and another fleet and 
army under Lord Howe is expected to join them. 
We are making great preparations to meet them, by

marching the militia of Maryland, Pennsylvania and 
New Jersey down to the scene of action, and have 
made large requisitions upon New England. I hope, 
for the honor of New England, and the salvation of 
America, our people will not be backward in march 
ing to New York. We must maintain and defend 
that important post, at all events. If the enemy get 
possession there, it will cost New England very dear. 
There is no danger of the small pox at New York. 
It is carefully kept out of the city and the army. I 
hope that your brother and mine too will go into the 
service of their country at this critical period of its 
distress. 

Our army at Crown Point is an object of wretched 
ness enough to fill a humane mind with horror ; dis 
graced, defeated, discontented, dispirited, diseased, 
naked, undisciplined, eaten up with vermin, no clothes, 
beds, blankets, no medicines, no victuals, but salt pork 
and flour. A chaplain from that army preached a 
sermon here the other day from " Cursed is he, that 
doeth the work of the Lord, deceitfully." I knew, 
better than he did, who the persons were, who de 
served these curses. But I could not help myself, nor 
my poor country, any more than he. I hope that 
measures will be taken to cleanse the arrny at Crown 
Point from the small pox, and that other measures 
will be taken in New England, by tolerating and en 
couraging inoculation, to render that distemper less 
Terrible. 

I am solicitous to hear what figure our new supe 
rior court made in their eastern circuit. What business

they did ? whether the grand juries and petit juries 
were sworn ? whether they tried any criminals, or 
any civil actions? how the people were affected at 
the appearance of Courts again ? how the judges 
were treated ? whether with respect or cold neglect, 
&c. Every colony upon the continent will soon he 
in the same situation. They arc erecting govern 
ments as fast as children build cob-houses ; but, I 
conjecture, they will hardly throw them down again 
so soon. 

The practice we have hitherto been in, of ditching 
round about our enemies, will not always do. We 
must learn to use other weapons than the pick and the 
spade. Our armies must be disciplined, and learn to 
fight. I have the satisfaction to reflect that our Mas 
sachusetts people, when they have been left to them 
selves, have been constantly fighting and skirmishing, 
and always with success. I wish the same valor, 
prudence and spirit had been discovered everywhere. 



LETTER LXIII. 



Philadelphia, 7 July, 1776. 

IT is worth the while of a person, obliged to write 
as much as I do, to consider the varieties of style. 
The epistolary is essentially different from the oratori- 



132 LETTERS. 

cal and the historical style. Oratory abounds with 
figures. History is simple, but grave, majestic and 
formal. Letters, like conversation, should be free, 
easy, and familiar. Simplicity and familiarity are the 
characteristics of this kind of writing. Affectation 
is as disagreeable in a letter, as in conversation, and 
therefore, studied language, premeditated method and 
sublime sentiments are not expected in a letter. Not 
withstanding which, the sublime as well as the beauti 
ful, and the novel, may naturally enough appear, in 
familiar letters among friends. Among the ancients 
there- are two illustrious examples of the epistolary 
style, Cicero and Pliny, whose letters present you 
with models of fine writing, which have borne the 
criticism of almost two thousand years. In these 
you see the sublime, the beautiful, the novel and the 
pathetic, conveyed in as much simplicity, ease, free 
dom and familiarity, as language is capable of. 

Let me request you to turn over the leaves of the 
Preceptor to a letter of Pliny the younger, in which 
he has transmitted to these days the history of his 
uncle s philosophical curiosity, his heroic courage 
and his melancholy catastrophe. Read it, and say, 
whether it is possible to write a narrative of facts in a 
better manner. It is copious and particular in select 
ing the circumstances most natural, remarkable and 
affecting. There is not an incident omitted, which 
ought to have been remembered, nor one inserted 
that is not worth remembrance. It gives you an idea 
of the scene, as distinct and perfect, as if a painter 
had drawn it to the life before your eyes. It interests 



LETTERS. 133 

your passions us much as if you had been an eye 
witness of the whole transaction. Yet there are no 
figures or art used. All is as simple, natural, easy and 
familiar as if the story had been told in conversation, 
without a moment s premeditation. 

Pope and Swift have given the world a collection 
of their letters ; but I think, in general, they fall 
short, in the epistolary way, of their own eminence 
in poetry and other branches of literature. Very 
few of their letters have ever engaged much of my 
attention. Gay s letter concerning the pair of lovers 
killed by lightning, is worth more than the whole 
collection, in point of simplicity and elegance of 
composition, and as a genuine model of the epistolary 
style. There is a book, which I wish you owned, 
I mean Rollin s Belles Lettres, in which the variations 
of style are explained. 

Early youth is the time to learn the arts and 
sciences, and especially to correct the car and the 
imagination, by forming a style. I wish you would 
think of forming the taste and judgment of your child 
ren now, before any unchaste sounds have fastened 
on their ears, and before any affectation or vanity is 
settled on their minds, upon the pure principles of 
nature. Music is a great advantage ; for style de 
pends, in part, upon a delicate ear. The faculty of 
writing is attainable by art, practice and habit only. 
The sooner, therefore, the practice begins, the more 
likely it will be to succeed. Have no mercy upon 
an affected phrase, any more than an affected air, 
gait, dress or manners. 



134 LETTERS. 

Your children hare capacities equal to any thing. 
There is a vigor in the understanding and a spirit 
and fire in the temper of every one of them, which 
is capable of ascending the heights of art, science, 
trade, war or politics. They should be set to com 
pose descriptions of scenes and objects, and narrations 
of facts and events. Declamations upon topics and 
other exercises of various sorts should be prescribed 
to them. Set a child to form a description of a 
battle, a storm, a siege, a cloud, a mountain, a lake, 
a city, a harbor, a country seat, a meadow, a forest, 
or almost any thing that may occur to your thoughts. 
Set him to compose a narration of all the little 
incidents and events of a day, a journey, a ride or a 
walk. In this way a taste will be formed, and a 
facility of writing acquired. 

For myself, as I never had a regular tutor, I never 
studied any thing methodically, and consequently, 
never was completely accomplished in any thing. 
But, as I am conscious of my own deficiency in these 
respects, I should be the less pardonable, if I neglect 
ed the education of my children. In grammar, 
rhetoric, logic, my education was imperfect, because 
unmethodical. Yet I have perhaps read more upon 
these arts, and considered them in a more extensive 
view, than some others.

LETTER LXIV. 



[Philadelphia], 10 July, 1776. 

You will sec, by the newspapers, which I, from time 
to time, enclose, with what rapidity the colonies pro 
ceed in their political manoeuvres. How many ca 
lamities might have been avoided, if these measures 
had been taken twelve months ago, or even no longer 
ago than last December ? 

The colonies to the south are pursuing the sai 
maxims which have heretofore governed those to the 
north. In constituting their new governments, their 
plans arc remarkably popular, more so than I could 
over have imagined ; even more popular than the 
" Thoughts on Government ; " and in the choice of 
their rulers, capacity, spirit, and zeal in the cause 
supply the place of fortune, family, and every other 
consideration which used to have weight with man 
kind. My friend Archibald Bullock, Esquire, is Gover 
nor of Georgia. John Rutledge, Esquire, is Governor 
of South Carolina. Patrick Henry, Esquire, is Gover 
nor of Virginia, &c. Dr. Franklin will be Governor of 
Pennsylvania. The now members of this city arc all 
in this taste, chosen because of their inflexible zeal for 
independence. All the old members left out because 
they opposed independence, or at least were luke 
warm about it. Dickinson, Morris, Allen, all fallen,

vast advantages in point of fortune, family and abili 
ties. I am inclined to think, however, and to wish 
that these gentlemen may be restored at a fresh elec- 
\j v tion, because, although mistaken in some points, they 
are good characters, and their great wealth and nu 
merous connexions will contribute to strengthen Amer 
ica, and cement her union. 

I wish I were at perfect liberty to portray before 
you all these characters in their genuine lights, and 
to explain to you the course of political changes in 
this province. It would give you a great idea of the 
spirit and resolution of the people, and sh jw you, in a 
striking point of view, the deep roots of American in 
dependence in all the colonies. But it is not prudent 
to commit to writing such free speculations in the 
present state of things. Time, which takes away the 
veil, may lay open the secret springs of this surprising 
revolution. But I find, although the colonies have dif 
fered in religion, laws, customs and manners, yet 
in the great essentials of society aad~ government, 
they are all alike. 



LETTER LXV.

now. But we have no intelligence of any such 
design, and all that we now know of the motions, 
plans, operations and designs of the enemy, indicates 
the contrary. It is but just that you should have a 
little rest, and take a little breath. 

I wish I knew whether your brother and mine have 
enlisted in the army, and what spirit is manifested by 
our militia for marching to New York and Crown 
point. The militia of Maryland, New Jersey, Penn 
sylvania and the lower counties are marching with 
much alacrity, and a laudable zeal to take care of 
Howe and his army at Staten Island. The army in 
New York is in high spirits, and seems determin 
ed to give the enemy a serious reception. The 
unprincipled and unfeeling and unnatural inhabitants 
of Staten Island are cordially receiving the enemy, 
and, deserters say, have engaged to take arms. 
They are an ignorant, cowardly pack of scoundrels. 
Their numbers are small, and their spirit less. 

It is sometime since I received any letter from you. 
The Plymouth one was the last. You must write 
me, every week, by the post, if it is but a few lines. 
It gives me many spirits. I design to write to the 
General Court requesting a dismission, or at least, 
a furlough. I think to propose that they choose four 
more members, or, at least, three more, that so, we 
may attend here in rotation. Two or three or four 
may be at home at a time, and the Colony properly 
represented notwithstanding. Indeed, while the Con 
gress were employed in political regulations, forming 
the sentiments of the people of the Colonies into

some consistent system, extinguishing the remainders 
of authority under the crown, and gradually erecting 
and strengthening governments .under the authority 
of the people, turning their thoughts upon the princi 
ples of polity and the forms of government, framing 
constitutions for the Colonies separately, and a limited 
and a defined Confederacy for the United Colonies, 
and in some other measures, which I do not choose 
to mention particularly, but which are now determin 
ed, or near the point of determination, I flattered 
myself that I might have been of some little use 
here. But now, these matters will be soon complet 
ed, and very little business will be to be done here, 
but what will be either military or commercial; 
branches of knowledge and business for which 
hundreds of others in our province are much better 
qualified than I am. I shall therefore request my 
masters to relieve me. 

I am not a little concerned about my health, which 
seems to have been providentially preserved to me, 
much beyond my expectations. But I begin to feel 
the disagreeable effects of unremitting attention to 
business for so long a time, and a want of exercise, 
and the bracing quality of my native air ; so that I 
have the utmost reason to fear an irreparable injury 
to my constitution, if I do not obtain a little relaxa 
tion. The fatigues of war are much less destructive 
to health, than the painful, laborious attention to 
debates, and to writing, which drinks up the spirits 
and consumes the strength. 

I am, &c.

LETTER LXVI. 

Philadelphia, 15 July, 177G. 

MY very deserving friend, Mr. Gerry, sets off tomor 
row for Boston, worn out of health, by the fatigues 
of this station. lie is an excellent man, and an ac 
tive, able statesman. I hope he will soon return 
hither. I am sure I should be glad to return with 
him, but I cannot. I must wait to have the guard 
relieved. 

There is a most amiable, laudable and gallant 
spirit prevailing in these middle colonies. The mili 
tia turn out in great numbers, and in high spirits, in 
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware, 
so that we hope to resist Howe and his myrmidons. 

Independence is, at last, unanimously agreed to in 
the New York Convention. You will see, by the 
newspapers enclosed, what is going forward in Vir 
ginia and Maryland and New Jersey. Farewell! 
farewell ! infatuated, besotted, step-dame. I have not 
time to add more, than that I receive letters from you 
but seldom of late. Tomorrow s post, I hope, will 
bring me some. So I hoped of last Saturday s and 
last Tuesday s. 

Ever Yours,

Philadelphia, 20 Jolj, 1776. 

I CANNOT omit the opportunity of writing you a line 
by this post This letter, will, I suppose, find you, in 
some degree or other, under the influence of the 
small pox. 1 The air is of very great importance. I 
don t know your physician, but I hope he wotf t de 
prive you of air, more than is necessary. 

We had yesterday an express from General Lee in 
Charleston, South Carolina, with an account of a 
brilliant little action between the armament under 
Clinton and Cornwallis, and a battery on Sullivan s 
Island, which terminated very fortunately for Ameri 
ca. I will endeavour to enclose with this, a printed 
account of it It has given us good spirits here, and 
will have a happy effect upon our armies at New 
York and Ticonderoga. Surely our northern soldiers 
will not suffer themselves to be outdone by their breth 
ren so nearly under the sun. I don l yet hear of any 
Massachusetts men at New York. Our people must 
not flinch, at this critical moment, when their country 
is in more danger than it ever will be again, perhaps. 
What will they say, if the Howes should prevail 
against our forces, at so important a post as New

Lord Howe s letter and proclamation, which has let

Gentlemen here, who either were or pretended to be 
deceived heretoforeVriow see or pretend to see through 
such artifices. I apprehend hi? Lordship is afraid of 
being attacked upon Staten Island, and is throwing out 
his barrels to amuse Leviathan, until his reinforce

LETTER LXVIII. 



Philadelphia, 20 July, 177G. 

THIS has been a dull day to me. I waited the arrival 
of the post with much solicitude and impatience, but 
his arrival made me more solicitous still. " To be 
left at the Post Office," in your handwriting on the 
back of a few lines from the Doctor, was all that I 
could learn of you and my little folks. If you were 
too busy to write, I hoped that some kind hand would 
have been found to let me know something about you. 
Do my friends think that I have been a politician so 
long, as to have lost all feeling? Do they suppose I 
have forgotten my wife and^children ? Or are they 
so panic-struck with the loss of Canada, as to be 



142 LETTERS. 

afraid to correspond with me ? Or have they forgot 
ten that you have a husband, and your children a 
father ? What have I done, or omitted to do, that I 
should be thus forgotten and neglected in the most 
tender and affecting scene of my life ? Don t mis 
take me. I don t blame you. Your time and thoughts 
must have been wholly taken up with your own and 
your family s situation and necessities ; but twenty 
other persons might have informed me. 

I suspect that you intended to have run slily 
through the small pox with the family, without letting 
me know it, and then have sent me an account that 
you were all well. This might be a kind intention, 
and if the design had succeeded, would have made 
me very joyous. But the secret is out. and I am left 
to conjecture. But as the faculty have this distemper 
so much under command, I will flatter myself with 
the hope and expectation of soon hearing of your re 
covery. 



LETTER LX1X. 



Philadelphia, 29 July, 1776. 

How are you all this morning ? Sick, weak, faint, 
in pain, or pretty well recovered ? By this time, you 
are well acquainted with the small pox. Pray, how 
do you like it ?

We have no news. It is very hard that half a 
dozen or half a score armies can t supply us with 
news. We have a famine, a perfect dearth of this 
necessary article. I am, at this present writing, per 
plexed and plagued with two knotty problems in po 
litics. You love to pick a political bone. So I will 
even throw it to you. 

If a confederation should take place, one great ques 
tion is, how we shall vote. Whether each colony shall 
count one ? or whether each shall have a weight in 
proportion to its number, or wealth, or exports and 
imports, or a compound ratio of all ? Another is, 
whether Congress shall have authority to limit the di 
mensions of each colony, to prevent those, which 
claim by charter, or proclamation, or commission to 
the south sea, from growing too great and powerful, 
so as to be dangerous to the rest ? 

Shall I write you a sheet upon each of these ques 
tions ? When you arc well enough to read, and I 
can find leisure enough to write, perhaps I may. 

Gerry carried with him a canister for you. But he 
is an old bachelor, and what is worse, a politician, 
and what is worse still, a^kind of soldier, so that I sup 
pose he will have so much curiosity to see armies and 
fortifications, and assemblies, that you will lose many 
a fine breakfast at a time when you want them most. 

Tell Betsey that this same Gerry is such another 
as herself, sex cxccptcd. How is my brother and 
friend Cranch ? How is his other self and their little 
selves, and ours ? Don t be in the dumps, above all

when I look at borne. But I will be gay if I can. 

Adieu. 



LETTER LXZ. 

[Philadelphia], 3 August, 1776. 

THE post was later than usual to-day, so that I had 
not yours of July 24, till this evening. You have 
made me very happy, by the particular and favorable 
account you give me, of all the family. But I don t 
understand how there are so many, who have no erup 
tions and no symptoms. The inflammation in the arm 
might do, but without these, there is no small pox. I 
will lay a wager, that your whole hospital has not had 
so much small pox as Mrs. Katy Quincy. Upon my 
word, she has had an abundance of it, but is finally 
recovered, looks as fresh as a rose, but pitted all over, 
as thick as ever you saw any one. I, this evening, 
presented your compliments, and thanks to Mr. Han 
cock, for his polite offer of his house, and likewise 
your compliments to his lady and Mrs. Katy. 



4 August. 

Went this morning to the Baptist meeting, in hopes 
of hearing Mr. Stillman, but was disappointed. He was

there, but another gentleman preached. His action 
was violent to a degree bordering on fury. His ges 
tures unnatural and distorted. Not the least idea of 
grace in Ins motions, or elegance in his style. His 
voice was vociferous, and boisterous, and his compo 
sition almost wholly destitute of ingenuity. I wonder 
extremely at the fondness of our people for scholars 
educated at the southward, and for southern preach 
ers. There is no one thing in which we excel them 
more, than in our university, our scholars and preach 
ers. Particular gentlemen here, who have improved 
upon their education by travel, shine ; but in general, 
old Massachusetts outshines her younger sisters. Still 
in several particulars they have more wit than we. 
They have societies, the philosophical society par 
ticularly, which excites a scientific emulation, and 
propagates their fame. If ever I get through this 
scene of politics and war, I will spend the remainder 
of my days in endeavoring to instruct my country 
men, in the art of making the most of their abilities 
and virtues ; an art, which they have, hitherto, too 
much neglected. A philosophical society shall be 
established at Boston, if I have wit and address enough 
to accomplish it, sometime or other. Pray set brother 
Cranch s philosophical head to plodding upon this 
project. Many of his lucubrations would have been 
published and preserved, for thc benefit of mankind, 
and for his honor, if such a club had existed. 

My countrymen want art and address. They want 
knowledge of the world. They want the exterior and 
superficial accomplishment of gentlemen, .upon which

the world has set so high a value. In solia abilities 
and real virtues, they vastly excel, in general, any 
people upon this continent. Our New England peo- 
pie are awkward and bashful, yet they are pert, os 
tentatious and vain ; a mixture, which excites ridi 
cule and gives disgust. They have not the faculty of 
showing themselves to the best advantage, nor Jie art 
of concealing this faculty ; an art and faculty which 
some people possess in the highest degree. Our defi 
ciencies in these respects are owing wholly to the lit 
tle intercourse we have with strangers, and to our 
inexperience in the world. These imperfections must 
be remedied, for New England must produce the 
heroes, the statesmen, the philosophers, or America 
will make no great figure, for some time. 

Our army is rather sickly at New York, and we 
live in daily expectation of hearing of some great 
event. May God Almighty grant it may be prosper 
ous for America. Hope is an anchor and a cordial. 
Disappointment, however, will not disconcert us. 

If you will come to Philadelphia in September, I 
will stay as long as you please. I should be as proud 
and happy as a bridegroom. 

Yours.

[Philadelphia], 12 August, 177G. 

MR. A. 1 sets off to-day, if the rain should not prevent 
him, with Colonel W hippie of Portsmouth, a brother 
of the celebrated Miss Hannah Whipplc, a sensible 
and worthy man. By him, I have sent you two bun 
dles of letters, which I hope you will be careful of. 
I thought I should not be likely to find a safer oppor 
tunity. By them, you will sec, that my private cor 
respondence alone is business enough for a lazy man. 
I think I have answered all but a few of those large 
bundles. 

A French vessel, n pretty large brigantine, deeply 
laden, arrived here yesterday, from Martinique. She 
had fifty barrels of limes, which arc all sold, already, at 
such prices, that the amount of them will be sufficient 
to load the brig with flour. A trade, we sec, even now, 
in the midst of summer, is not totally interrupted by 
all the efforts of our enemies. Prizes arc taken, in no 
small numbers. A gentleman told me a few days 
ago, that he had summed up the sugar, which has been 
taken, and it amounted to three thousand hogsheads, 
since which, two other ships have been taken, and 
carried into Maryland. Thousands of schemes for 
privateering are afloat in American imaginations.

148 LETTERS. 

Some are for taking the Hull ships, with woollens, for 
Amsterdam and Rotterdam ; some are for the 
tin ships ; some for the Irish linen ships ; some, for 
outward bound, and others, for inward bound India- 
men; some for the Hudson s bay ships, and many, 
for West India sugar ships. Out of these specula 
tions, many fruitless and some profitable projects will 
grow. 

We have no news from New York. All is quiet 
as yet Our expectations are raised. The eyes of 
the world are upon Washington and Howe, and their 
armies. The wishes and prayers of the virtuous part 
of it, I hope, will be answered. If not, yet virtues 
grow out of affliction. I repeat my request that you 
would ask some of the members of the general court, 
if they can send me horses ; and if they cannot, that 
you would send them. I can live no longer without a 
servant and a horse.

middle States begin to taste the sweets of war. Ten 
thousand difficulties and wants occur, which they had 
no conception of before. Their militia are as clam 
orous, and impatient of discipline, and mutinous as 
ours, and more so. There has been seldom less than 
four thousand men in this city at a time, for a fort 
night past, on their march to New Jersey. Here they 
wait, until we grow very angry about them, for can 
teens, camp kettles, blankets, tents, shoes, hose, arms, 
flints and other dittoes, while we are under a very criti 
cal solicitude for our army at New York, on account 
of the insufficiency of men. 

I want to be informed of the state of things with 
you ; whether there is a scarcity of provisions of any 
kind, of West India articles, of clothing ? Whether 
any trade is carried on, any fishery ? Whether any 
vessels arrive from abroad, or whether any go to sea 
upon foreign voyages. I wish to know, likewise, 
what posture of defence you are in ? What fortifica 
tions are at Nantaskct, at Long Island, Pettick s Island, 
&c., and what men and officers there arc to garrison 
them ? We hear nothing from the Massachusetts, 
lately, in comparison of what we did, when the army 
was before Boston. 

I must not conclude without repeating my request, 
that you would ask some of the members of the gene 
ral court to send me horses, and if they cannot, to 
send them yourself.

LETTER 



Philadelphia, 14 August, 177& 

THIS is the anniversary of a memorable day in the 
history of America. A day when the principle of 
American resistance and independence was first as 
serted and carried into action. The stamp office fell 
before the rising spirit of our countrymen. 1 It is not 
impossible that the two grateful brothers may make 
their grand attack this very day. If they should, it is 
possible it may be more glorious for this country, than 
ever: it is certain, it will become more memorable. 
Your favors of August 1st and 5th came by yester 
day s post. I congratulate you all upon your agreea 
ble prospects. Even my pathetic little hero Charles, 
I hope, will have the distemper finely. It is very odd 
that the Doctor cannot put infection enough into his 
veins ; nay, it is unaccountable to me, that he has not 
taken it the natural way, before now. I am under 
little apprehension, prepared as he is, if he should. 
I am concerned about you, much more. So many 
persons about you sick, the children troublesome, your 
mind perplexed, yourself weak and relaxed. The 
situation must be disagreeable. The country air and 
exercise, however, will refresh you.

LETTERS. 151 

I am put upon a committee, to prepare a device for 
a golden medal, to commemorate the surrender of 
Boston to the American arms, and upon another, to 
prepare devices for a great seal, for the confederated 
States. There is a gentleman here of French extrac 
tion, whose name is Du Simitiere, a painter by pro 
fession, whose designs are very ingenious, and his 
drawings well executed. lie has been applied to for 
his advice. I waited on him yesterday, and saw his 
sketches. For the medal he proposes, Liberty, with 
her spear and pileus, leaning on General Washington. 
The British fleet in Boston harbor with all their sterns 
towards the town, the American troops marching in. 
For the seal, he proposes, The arms of the several na 
tions from whence America has been peopled, r.s 
English, Scotch, Irish, Dutch, German, &c., each in a 
shield. On one side of them, Liberty with her pileus, 
on the other, a riflcr in his uniform, with his rifle gun 
in one hand, and his tomahawk in the other. This 
dress and these troops with this kind of armor being 
peculiar to America, unless the dress was known to 
the Romans. Dr. Franklin showed me yesterday a 
book, containing an account of the dresses of all the 
Roman soldiers, one of which appeared exactly like 
it. This M. du Simitiere is a very curious man. He 
has begun a collection of materials for a history of 
this revolution. He begins with the first advices of 
the tea ships. He cuts out of the newspapers every 
scrap of intelligence, and every piece of speculation, 
and pastes it upon clean paper, arranging them under 
the head of that State to which they belong, and in-

tends to bind them up in volumes. He has a list of 
every speculation and pamphlet concerning indepen 
dence, and another of those concerning forms of gov- &gt; 
eminent 

Doctor F. proposes a device for a seal. Moses 
lifting up his wand, and dividing the red sea, and 
Pharaoh in his chariot overwhelmed with the waters. 
This motto. "Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to 
God." 

Mr. Jefferson proposed, The children of Israel in 
the wilderness, led by a cloud by day, and a pillar of 
fire by night and on the other side, Hengist and 
Horsa, the Saxon chiefs, from whom we claim the 
honor of being descended, and whose political princi 
ples and form of government \ve have assumed. 

I proposed, The choice of Hercules, as engraved by 
Gribelin, in some editions of Lord ShaAesbury s works. 
The hero resting on his club. Virtue pointing to her 
rugged mountain on one hand, and persuading him to 
ascend. Sloth, glancing at her flowery paths of pleas 
ure, wantonly reclining on the ground, displaying 
the charms both of her eloquence and person, to 
seduce him into vice. But this is too complicated a 
group for a seal or medal, and it is not original. 

I shall conclude by repeating my request for hor 
ses and a servant. Let the horses be good ones. I 
can t ride a bad horse so many hundred miles. If 
our affairs had not been in so critical a state at New 
York, I should have run away before now. But I am 
determined, now, to stay until some gentleman is sent

here in my room, and until my horses come. But the 
time will be very tedious. 

The whole force is arrived at Staten Island. 



LETTER LXXIV 



Philadelphia, 18 August, 177G. 

MY letters to you are an odd mixture. They would 
appear to a stranger like the dish which is sometimes 
called omnium gatherum. This is the first time, I 
hclievc, that these two words were ever put together 
in writing. The literal interpretation I take to he "a 
collection of all things." But, as I said hcfore, the 
words having never hefore hcen written, it is not pos 
sible to be very learned in telling you what the Ara 
bic, Syriac, Chaldaic, Greek and Roman commenta 
tors say upon the subject. Amidst all th.e rubbish 
that constitutes the heap, you will see a proportion of 
affection for my friends, my family and country, that 
gives a complexion to the whole. I have a very ten 
der, feeling heart. This country knows not, and never 
can know the torments, I have endured. for its sake. 
I am glad it never can know,^ for it would give more 
pain to the benevolent and hurnane, than I could wish 
even the wicked and malicious to feel. 

I have seen in this world hut a little of that pure 



154 LETTERS. 

flame of patriotism which certainly bums in some 
breasts. There is much of the ostentation and affec 
tation of it. I have known a few, who could not bear 
to entertain a selfish design, nor to be suspected by 
others of such a meanness ; but these are not the most 
respected by the world. A man must be selfish, even 
to acquire great popularity. He must grasp for him 
self, under specious pretences for the public good, and 
he must attach himself to his relations, connexions, 
and friends, by becoming a champion for their inter 
ests, in order to form a phalanx about him for his 
own defence, to make them trumpeters of his praise, 
and sticklers for his fame, fortune and honor. 

My friend Warren, the late Governor Ward, and 
Mr. Gadsden are three characters, in which I have 
seen the most generous disdain of every spice and 
species of such meanness. The two last had not great 
abilities, but they had pure hearts. Yet they had 
less influence than many others, who had neither so 
considerable parts, nor any share at all of their puri 
ty of intention. Warren has both talents and virtues 
beyond most men in this world, yet his character has 
never been in proportion. Thus it always is, and has 
been and will be. Nothing has ever given me more 
mortification than a suspicion that has been propaga 
ted of me, that 1 am actuated by private views, and 
have been aiming at high places. The office of chief 
justice has occasioned this jealousy, and it never will 
be allayed, until I resign it. Let me have my farm, 
family and goosequill, and all the honors and offices 
this world has to bestow, may go to tho?^, who deserve 
them better and desire them more. I court them not

There are very few people in this world with whom 
I can bear to converse. I can treat all with decency 
and civility, and converse with them, when it is ne 
cessary, on points of business. But I am never happy 
in their company. This has made me a recluse, and 
will, one day, make me a hermit. I had rather build 
stone wall upon Penn s hill, than to be the first prince 
in Europe, or the first General, or first Senator in 
America. 

Our expectations are very high of some great af 
fair at New York. 



LETTER LXXV. 



Philadelphia, 21 August, 1770. 

\ 

YESTERDAY morning, I took a walk into Arch street 
to see Mr. Peale s Painter s room. Peale is from Ma 
ryland, a tender, soft, affectionate creature. He 
showed me a large picture, containing a group of fig 
ures, which, upon inquiry, I found were his family ; 
his mother and his wife s mother, himself and his wife, 
his brothers and sisters, and his children, sons and 
daughters, all young. There was a pleasant, a hap 
py cheerfulness in their countenances, and a famil 
iarity in their air towards each other. 

He showed me one moving picture. His wife, all 



156 LETTERS. 

bathed in tears, with a child about six months old, laid 
out upon her lap. This picture struck me prodigiously. 
He has a variety of portraits, very well done, but not 
so well as Copley s portraits. Copley is the great 
est master that ever was in America. His portraits 
far exceed West s. Peale has taken General Wash- 
ington, Dr. Franklin, Mrs. Washington, Mrs. Rush, 
Mrs. Hopkinson, Mr. Blair McClenachan and his lit 
tle daughter in one picture, his lady and her little son 
in another. Peale showed me some books upon the 
art of painting. Among the rest one by Sir Joshua 
Reynolds, the President of the English Academy of 
painters, by whom the pictures of General Conway 
and Colonel Barre, in Faneuil Hall, were taken. He 
showed me too, a great number of miniature pictures. 
Among the rest, Mr. Hancock and his lady, Mr. Smith 
of South Carolina, whom you saw the other day in 
Boston, Mr. Custis, and many others. 

He showed me, likewise, draughts, or rather 
sketches, of gentlemen s seats in Virginia, where he 
had been, Mr. Corbin s, Mr. Page s, General Wash 
ington s, &c. Also a variety of rough drawings made 
by great masters in Italy, which he keeps as models. 
He showed me several imitations of heads, which he 
had made in clay, as large as the life, with his hands 
only. Among the rest, one of his own head and face, 
which was a great likeness. He is ingenious. He 
has vanity, loves finery, wears a sword, gold lace, 
speaks French, is capable of friendship, and strong 
family attachments, and natural affections. 

At this shop, I met Mr. Francis Hopkinson, late a 



\ 

LETTERS. 157 

Mandamus Counsellor of New Jersey, now a member 
of the continental Congress, who, it seems, is a native 
* of Philadelphia, a son of a prothonotary of this coun 

ty, who was a person much respected. The son was 
liberally educated, and is a painter and a poet. I 
have a curiosity to penetrate a little deeper into the 
bosom of this curious gentleman, and may possibly 
give you some more particulars concerning him. He 
is one of your pretty, little, curious, ingenious men. 
His head is not bigger than a large apple, less than 
our friend Pemberton, or Doctor Simon Tufts. I 
have not met with anything in natural history more 
amusing and entertaining than his personal appear 
ance yet he is genteel and well bred and is very 
social. 

I wish I had leisure and tranquillity of mind to 
amuse myself with those elegant, and ingenious arts of 
painting, sculpture, statuary, architecture and music. 
But I have not. A taste in all of them is an agreea 
ble accomplishment. Mr. Hopkinson has taken in 
crayons with his own hand a picture of Miss Keys, a 
famous New Jersey beauty. He talks of bringing it 
to town, and in that case, I shall see it, I hope.

LETTER LXXYI. 



Philadelphia, 25 A ugut, 1776. 

THE day before yesterday and yesterday, we expected 
letters and papers by the post, but by some accident, 
or mismanagement of the riders, no post is arrived 
yet, which has been a great disappointment to me. I 
watch with longing eyes for the post, because you 
have been very good, of late, in writing by every one. 
I long to hear that Charles is in as fair a way through 
the distemper, as the rest of you. 

Poor Barrell is violently ill, in the next chamber to 
mine, of an inflammatory fever. I hear every cough, 
sigh and groan. His fate hangs in a critical suspense. 
The least thing may turn the scale against him. Miss 
Quincy is here, very humanely employed in nursing 
him. This goodness does her honor. Mr. Paine has 
recovered of his illness, and, by present appearances, 
is in better health than before. 1 hope it will not be 
my fate to be sick here. Indeed, I am not much afraid 
of these acute disorders; mine are more chronical, 
nervous and slow. I must have a ride, I cannot 
make it do without it. 

We are now approaching rapidly to the autumnal 
equinox, and no great blow has yet been struck, in the 
martial way, by our enemies, nor by us. If we should 
be blessed, this year, with a few storms, as happy as 
those which fell out last year in the beginning of 



LETTERS. 159 

September, they will do much for us. The British 
fleet, where they now lie, have not a harbor so con 
venient or safe as they had, last year. Another win 
ter, will do much for us too. We shall have more 
and better soldiers. We shall be better armed. We 
shall have a greater force at sea. We shall have 
more trade. Our artillery will be greatly increased, 
our officers will have more experience, and our sol 
diers more discipline, our politicians more courage 
and confidence, and our enemies less hope. Our 
American commonwealths will be all completely 
formed and organized, and every thing, I hope, will go 
on with greater vigor. 

After I had written thus far, the post came in and 
brought me your favor of the 14th of August. Abby 
by this time, I conclude, is well and Charles, I hope, 
is broken out. Don t you recollect, upon this occa 
sion, Doctor Bylcs s benediction to me, when I was in 
oculated ? As you will see the piquancy of it now, 
more than ever you could before, I will tell the story. 

After having been ten or eleven days inoculated, I 
lay lolling on my bed in Major Cunningham s cham 
ber under the tree of liberty, with half a doxen young 
fellows as lazy as myself, all waiting and wishing for 
symptoms and eruptions, all of a sudden appeared at 
the chamber door, the reverend Doctor with his rosy 
face, many-curled wig and .pontifical air and gait. " I 
have been thinking," says he, " that the clergy of this 
town ought, upon this occasion, to adopt the benedic 
tion of the romish clergy, and, when we enter the 
apartment of the sick, to say in the foreign pronuncia-

foreigners, as the Doctor pronounced them, Pox take

of the system of gravitation did not require a deeper 
reach of thought than this frivolous pun. 

Your sentiments of the importance of education in 
women are exactly agreeable to my own. Yet the 
femmes sarantes, are contemptible characters. So 
is that of a pedant universally, how muchsoever of a 
male he may be. In reading history, you will gener 
ally observe, when you light upon a great character, 
whether a general, a statesman, or philosopher, some 
female about him, either in the character of a mother, 
wife or sister, who has knowledge and ambition above 
the ordinary level of women, and that much of his 
eminence is owing to her precepts, example or insti 
gation, in some sliape or other. Let me mention an 
example or two. Sempronius Gracchus and Caius 
Gracchus, two great, though unfortunate men, are said 
to have been instigated to their great actions by their 
mother, who, in order to stimulate their ambition, told 
them, that she was known in Rome by the title of the 
mother-in-law of Scipio, not the mother of the Grac 
chi. Thus she excited their emulation and put them 
upon reviving the old project of an equal division of 
the conquered lands, (a genuine republican measure, 
though it had been too long neglected to be then prac 
ticable,) in order to make their names as illustrious as 
Scipio s. 

The great Duke who first excited the Portuguese 
to revolt from the Spanish monarchy, was spurred on

to his great enterprise by a most artful and ambitious 
wife, and thus indeed you will find it, very generally. 



LETTER LXXVII. 



Philadelphia, 5 September, 177G. 

MR. BASS arrived this day with the joyful news that 
you were all well. By this opportunity, I shall send 
you a canister of green tea by Mr. IJare. Before Mr. 
Gerry went away from hence, I asked Mrs. Yard to 
send a pound of green tea to you. She readily 
agreed. When I came home at night I was told Mr. 
G. was gone I asked Mrs. Y. if she had sent the 
canister? She said, yes, and that Mr. G. undertook to 
deliver it with a great deal of pleasure. From that 
time I flattered myself you would have the poor relief 
of a dish of good tea, under all your fatigues with the 
children, and under all the disagreeable circumstan 
ces attending the small pox ; and I never conceived a 
single doubt that you had received it, until Mr. Ger 
ry s return. I asked him, accidentally, whether he 
delivered it and he said, " Yes, to Mr. Samuel Ad 
ams s lady." * I was astonished. He misunderstood

. 

Mrs. Yard entirely, for upon inquiry, she affirms she 
told him, it was for Mrs. J. A. I was so vexed at this, 
that I have ordered another canister, and Mr. Hare 
has been kind enough to undertake to deliver it. How 
the dispute will be settled, I don t know. You must 
send a card to Mrs. S. A., and let her know, that the 
canister was intended for you, and she may send it 
you, if she chooses, as it was charged to me. It is 
amazingly dear. Nothing less than forty shillings, 
lawful money, a pound. 

I am rejoiced that my horses are come. I shall 
now be able to take a ride. But it is uncertain when 
I shall set off for home. I will not go at present Af 
fairs are too delicate and critical. The panic may 
seize 1 whom it will. It shall not seize me. I will 
stay here until the public countenance is better, or 
much worse. It must and will be better. I think it 
is not now bad. Lies by the million will be told you. 
Don t believe any of them. There is no danger of 
the communication being cutoff between the northern 
and southern colonies. I can go home when I please, 
in spite of all the fleet and army of Great Britain.

LETTER LXXVIII. 



[Philadelphia], Friday, f? September, 1770. 

THIS day, I think, has been the most remarkable of 
all. Sullivan came here from Lord IIo\vc, five days 
ago,with a message, that his lordship desired a half an 
hour s conversation with some of the members of Con 
gress in their private capacities. We have spent three 
or four days in debating, whether we should take 
any notice of it. I have, to the utmost of my abili 
ties, during the whole time, opposed our taking any 
notice of it. But, at last, it was determined by a ma 
jority, " that the Congress being the representatives 
of the free and independent States of America, it was 
improper to appoint any of their members to confer 
in their private characters with his lordship. But 
they would appoint a committee of their body, to 
wait on him, to know whether he had power to treat 
with Congress upon terms of peace, and to hear any 
propositions that his lordship may think proper to 
make." 

When the committee came to be balloted for, Dr. 
Franklin and your humble servant were unanimously 
chosen. Colonel R. H. Lee and Mr. Rutlcclge had 
an equal number ; but, upon a second vote, Mr. Rut- 
ledge was chosen. I requested to be excused, but 
was desired to consider of it until to-morrow. My 
friends here advise me to go. All the stanch and in- 



164 LETTERS. 

trepid are very earnest with me to go, and the timid 
and wavering, if any such there are, agree in the re 
quest So I believe I shall undertake the journey. I 
doubt whether his lordship will see us, hut the same 
committee will be directed to inquire into the state of 
the army at New York, so that there will be business 
enough, if his lordship makes none. It would fill this 
letter-book to give you all the arguments, for and 
against this measure, if I had liberty to attempt it. 
His lordship seems to have been playing off a number 
of Machiavelian manoeuvres, in order to throw upon 
us the odium of continuing this war. Those who 
have been advocates for the appointment of this com 
mittee are for opposing manoeuvre to manoeuvre, and 
are confident that the consequence will be, that the 
odium will fall upon him. However this may be, my 
lesson is plain, to ask a few questions and take his 
answers. 

I can think of but one reason for their putting me 
upon this embassy, and that is this. An idea has 
crept into many minds here, that his lordship is such 
another as Mr. Hutchinson, and they may possibly 
think that a man who has been accustomed to pene 
trate into the mazy windings of Hutchinson s heart, 
and the serpentine wiles of his head, may be tolerably 
qualified to converse with his lordship. 



Sunday, 8 September. 

Yesterday s post brought me yours of August 29. 
The report you mention " that I was poisoned upon 



LETTERS. 165 

my return home, at New York," I suppose will be 
thought to be a prophecy delivered by the oracle, in 
mystic language, and meant, that I should be political 
ly or morally poisoned by Lord Howe. But the proph 
ecy shall bo false. 



LETTER LXXIX. 

Philadelphia, Saturday, 14 September, 1770. 

YESTERDAY morning, I returned with Dr. Franklin and 
Mr. Rutleclgc from Slaten Island, where we met Lord 
Howe, and had about three hours conversation with 
him. The result of this interview will do no disser 
vice to us. It is now plain that his lordship has no 
power, but what is given him in the act of Parlia 
ment. His commission authorizes him to grant par 
dons upon submission, and to converse, confer, con 
sult and advise with such persons as he may think 
proper, upon American grievances, upon the instruc 
tions to Governors and the acts of Parliament, and if 
any errors should be found to have crept in, his ma 
jesty and the ministry were willing they should be rec 
tified. 

I found yours of 31st of August and 2d of Septem 
ber. I now congratulate you on your return home with 
the children. I am sorry to fijid you anxious on ac 
count of idle reports. Don t regard them. I think our 



166 LETTERS. 

friends are to blame to mention such silly stories. 
What good do they expect to do by it ? 

My ride has been of service to me. We were ab 
sent but four days. It was an agreeable excursion. 
His lordship is about fifty years of age. He is a well 
bred man, but his address is not so irresistible as it 
has been represented. I could name you many 
Americans, in your own neighborhood, whose art, ad 
dress and abilities are greatly superior. His head is 
rather confused, I think. 

When I shall return I can t say. 1 expect now 
every day fresh hands from Watertown. 



LETTER LXXZ. 

[Philadelphia], 22 September, 1776. 

WE have at last agreed upon a plan for forming a 
regular army. We have offered twenty dollars and 
a hundred acres of land to every man who will enlist 
during the war. And a new set of articles of war are 
agreed on. I will send you, if I can, a copy of these 
resolutions and regulations. 

I am at a loss what to write. News we have not. 
Congress seems to be forgotten by the armies. We 
are most unfaithfully served in the post office, as well 
as many other offices, civil and military. Unfaithful 
ness in public stations is deeply criminal. But there 



LETTERS. 167 

is no encouragement to be faithful. Neither profit, 
nor honor, nor applause is acquired by faithfulness. 
But I know by what. There is too much corruption 
even in this infant age of our republic. Virtue is not 
in fashion. Vice is not infamous. 



] October, 177(i. 

Since I wrote the foregoing, I have not been able 
to find time to write you a line. Although I can 
not write you so often as I wish, you are never out of 
my thoughts. I am repining at my hard lot in being 
torn from you much oftcner than I ought. I have 
often mentioned to you the multiplicity of my en 
gagements, arid have been once exposed to the ridicule 
and censure of the world for mentioning the great 
importance of the business which lay upon me ; and 
if this letter should ever see the light, it would be 
again imputed to vanity that I mention to you how 
busy I am. But I must repeat it by way of apology 
for not writing you oftener. From four o clock in the 
morning until ten at night, I have not a single mo 
ment which I can call my own. 1 will not say, that I 
expect to run distracted, to grow melancholy, to drop 
in an apoplexy or fall into a consumption ; but I do 
say, it is little less than a miracle, that one or other of 
these misfortunes has not befallen me before now. 

Your favors of 15th, 20th, and 23d September, are 
now before me. Every line from you gives me inex 
pressible pleasure, but it is a great grief to me that I 






168 LETTERS. 

can write no oftener to you. There is one thing which 
excites my utmost indignation and contempt. I mean 
the brutality with which people talk to you of my 
death. I beg you would openly affront every man, 
woman, or child, for the future, who mentions any 
such thing to you, except your relations and friends, 
whose affections you cannot douht. I expect it of all 
my friends, that they resent, as affronts to me, every 
repetition of such reports. 

I shall enclose to you Governor Livingston s speech. 
The most elegant and masterly ever made in Ameri 
ca. Depend upon it, the enemy cannot cut off the 
communication. I can come home when I will. They 
have New York and this is their ne plus vitro. 



LETTER LXXXI. 



Philadelphia, 4 October, 1776. 

I AM seated in a large library room with eight gentle- 
men round about me, all engaged in conversation. 
Amidst these interruptions, how shall I make it out 
to write a letter ? 

The first day of October, the day appointed by the 
charter of Pennsylvania for the annual election of 
Representatives, has passed away, and two counties 
only have chosen members, Bucks and Chester. The 



LETTERS. 169 

Assembly is therefore dead and the convention is dis 
solved. A new convention is to be chosen the begin 
ning of November. The proceedings of the late con 
vention are not well liked by the best of the Whigs. 
Their constitution is reprobated, and the oath with 
which they have endeavored to prop it, by obliging 
every man to swear that he will not add to, or dimin 
ish from, or any way alter that constitution, before ho 
can vote, is execrated. 

We live in the age of political experiments. Among 
many that will fail, some 1 hope will succeed. But 
Pennsylvania will be divided and weakened, and ren 
dered much less vigorous in the cause by the wretched 
ideas of government which prevail in the minds of 
many people in it. 



LETTER LXXXII. 

[Philadelphia], 8 October, 1776. 

I OUGHT to acknowledge with gratitude your constant 
kindness in writing to me by every post. Your fa 
vor of 29 September, 1 came by the last. I wish it had 
been in my power to have returned your civilities 
with the same punctuality, but it has not. Long before 
this, you have received letters from me, and newspa- 

1 Mrs. Adams s letters, Vol. I. p. 105. 



170 LETTEBS. 

pen containing a full account of the negotiation. The 
communication is still open, and the post-riders now 
do their duty, and will continue to do so. 

I assure you, we are as much at a loss, about affairs 
at New York, as you are. In general, our Generals 
were outgeneraled on Long Island, and Sullivan and 
Stirling with a thousand men were made prisoners, in 
consequence of which and several other unfortunate 
circumstances, a council of war thought it prudent to 
retreat from that island and Governor s Island, and 
then from New York. They are now posted at Haer- 
lem, about ten or eleven miles from the city. They 
led behind them some provisions, some cannon and 
some baggage. Wherever the men of war have ap 
proached, our militia have most manfully turned their 
backs and run away, officers and men, like sturdy 
fellows ; and their panics have sometimes seized the 
regular regiments. One little skirmish on Montres- 
or s Island ended with the loss of the brave Major 
Henley and the disgrace of the rest of the party. An 
other skirmish, which might indeed be called an ac 
tion, ended in the defeat and shameful flight of the 
enemy with the loss of the brave Colonel Knowlton 
on our part. The enemy have possession of Paulus 
hook and Bergen point, places on the Jersey side of 
North river. By this time their force is so divided 
between Staten Island, Long Island, New York, Pau 
lus hook, and Bergen point, that I think they will do 
no great matter more this fall, unless the expiration 
of the term of enlistment of our army should disband 
it If our new enlistment fill up for soldiers during 



LETTERS. 171 

the war, we shall do well enough. Every body must 



encourage this. 

You are told that a regiment of Yorkers behaved 
ill, and it may be true ; but I can tell you that sever 
al regiments of Massachusetts men behaved ill too. 
The spirit of venality you mention is the most dread 
ful and alarming enemy America has to oppose. It 
is as rapacious and insatiable as the, grave. We are 
in the face Romnli non republica Flalonis. This 
predominant avarice will ruin America, if she is ever 
ruined. If God Almighty does not interpose by his 
grace to control this universal idolatry to the mammon 
of unrighteousness we shall be given up to the chas 
tisements of his judgments. I am ashamed of the age 
I live in. 

You surprise me with your account of the prayers 
in public for an abdicated King, a pretender to the 
crown. Nothing of that kind is heard in this place, 
or any other part of the continent, but New York and 
the place you mention. This practice is treason 
against the State, and cannot be long tolerated. 

Don t leave off writing to me. I write as often as 
I can. I am glad master John has an office so useful 
to his mamma and papa as that of post- rider.

I SUPPOSE your ladyship has been in the twitters for 
some time, because you have not received a letter by 
every post, as you used to do. But I am coming to 
make my apology in person. I yesterday, asked and 
obtained leave of absence. It will take me till next 
Monday to get ready, to finish off a few remnants of 
public business, and to put my private affairs in proper 
order. On the 14th day of October I shall get away, 
perhaps. But I don t expect to reach home in less 
than a fortnight, perhaps not in three weeks, as I 
shall be obliged to make stops by the way.

agreeable ride to this place, and to-morrow morning, 
we set off for Providence, or some other route. 

Present my affection in the tcndercst manner to my 
little deserving daughter and my amiable sons. It 
was cruel parting this morning. My heart was most 
deeply affected although I had the presence of mind 
to appear composed. May God Almighty s provi 
dence protect you, my dear, and all our little ones. 
My good genius, my guardian angel, whispers me, 
that we shall see happier days, and that I shall live to 
enjoy the felicities of domestic life with her, whom my 
heart esteems above all earthly blessings. 



LETTER LXXXV. 



Hartford, 13 January, 1777. 

THE riding has been so hard and rough, and the 
weather so cold, that we have not been able to push 
further than this place. My little colt has performed 
very well hitherto, and I think, will cany me through 
this journey very pleasantly. 

Our spirits have been cheered by two or three 
pieces of good news, which Commissary Trumbull, 
who is now with me, tells us he saw yesterday, in a 
letter from General Washington, who has gained an- 



174 LETTERS. 

other considerable advantage of the enemy at Stony 
Brook, in the Jerseys, as General Putnam has gained 
another at Burlington, and the Jersey militia a third. 
The particulars you will have, before this reaches 
you, in the public prints. The communication of 
intelligence begins to be more open, and we have no 
apprehensions of danger in the route we shall take. 
Howe has reason to repent of his rashness, and will 
have more. 

My love to my dear little ones. They are all very 
good children, and I have no doubt will continue so. 
I will drop a line as often as I can. 

Adieu.

IT is now generally believed that General Washington 
has killed and taken at least two thousand of Mr. 
Howe s army since Christmas. Indeed the evidence 
of it is from the General s own letters. You know I 
ever thought Mr. Howe s march through the Jerseys 
a rash step. It has proved so. But how much more 
so would it have been thought, if the Americans 
could all have viewed it in that light, and exerted 
themselves, as they might and ought The whole

Fishkill, 1777. 

AFTER a march like that of Hannibal over the Alps, 
we arrived, last night, at this place, where we found 
the utmost difficulty to get forage for our horses, and 
lodgings for ourselves, and, at last, were indebted to 
the hospitality of a private gentleman, Colonel Brink- 
hofF, who very kindly cared for us. 

We came from Hartford through Farrnington, 
Southington, Waterbury, Woodbury, New Milford, 
New Fairfield, the oblong, &c. to Fishkill. Of all the 
mountains I ever passed, these are the worst. We 
found one advantage, however, in the cheapness of 
travelling. I don t find one half of the discontent, 
nor of the terror, here, that I left in the Massachu 
setts. People seem sanguine that they shall do some 
thing grand this winter. 

I am well and in good spirits. My horse performs

has been dreadfully severe. 



LETTER 



Poaghkeepsie, 19 January, 1777. 

THERE is too much ice in Hudson s river to cross it 
in ferry boats, and too little to cross it without, in 
most places, which has given us the trouble of riding 
up the Albany road, as far as this place, where we 
expect to go over on the ice, but if we should be dis 
appointed here, we must go up as far as Esopus, 
about fifteen miles further. 

This, as well as Fishkill, is a pretty village. We 
are almost wholly among the Dutch. Zealous against 
the Tories, who have not half the tranquillity here, 
that they have in the town of Boston, after all the 
noise that has been made about New York Tories. 
We are treated with the utmost respect, wherever 
we go, and have met with nothing like an insult from 
any person whatever. I heard ten reflections, and 
twenty sighs and groans, among my constituents, to 
one here. 

I shall never have done hoping that my country 
men will contrive some coup dt main for the wretches 
at Newport. The winter is the time. Our enemies 
have divided their force. Let us take advantage of it

Bethlehem, Orange County, 
State of New York, 20 January, 1777. 

Tins morning, we crossed the North River, at Pough- 
keepsie, on the ice, after having ridden many miles 
OR the east side of it, to find a proper place. We 
landed at New Maryborough, and passed through that 
and Newbprough, to New Windsor, where we dined. 
This place is nearly opposite to Fishkill, and but little 
above the Highlands, where Fort Constitution and 
Fort Montgomery stand. The Highlands are a grand 
sight, a range of vast mountains which seem to be 
rolling like a tumbling sea. From New Windsor we 
came to this place, \\here we put up, and now we 
have a free and uninterrupted passage in a good road 
to Pennsylvania. 

General Washington, with his little army, is at 
Morristown. Cornwallis, with his larger one, at Bruns- . 
wick. Oh ! that the continental army was full. Now 
is the time ! 

My little horse holds out finely, although we have 
lost much time, and travelled a great deal of un 
necessary way^ to get over the North River. We 
have reports of our people s taking Fort Washington 
again, and taking four hundred more prisoners, and 
six more pieces of cannon. But as I know not the 
persons who bring these accounts, I pay no attention 
to them.

Ea*ton, at the Forks of Delaware river, in the 

State of Pennsylvania, 24 January, 1777. 

WE have at last crossed the Delaware and are agree 
ably lodged at Easton, a little town situated on a point 
of land formed by the Delaware on one side, and the 
river Lehigh on the other. There is an elegant stone 
church here, built by the Dutch people, by whom the 
town is chiefly inhabited, and what is remarkable be 
cause uncommon, the Lutherans and Calvinists united 
to build this church, and the Lutheran and Culvinist 
ministers, allernately, officiate in it There is also a 
handsome Court House. The buildings, public and 
private, are all of limestone. Here are some Dutch 
Jews. 

Yesterday, we had the pleasure of seeing the Mo 
ravian mills in New Jersey. These mills belong to 
the society of Moravians in Bethlehem in Pennsylva 
nia, They are a great curiosity. The building is of 
limestone, four stories high. It is not in my power 
to give a particular description of this piece of me 
chanism. A vast quantity of grain of all sorts is col 
lected here. 

We have passed through the famous county of 
Sussex in New Jersey, where the Sussex Court House 
stands, and where, we have so often been told, the 
Tories are so numerous and dangerous. We met 



LETTERS.

with no molestation nor insult. We stopped at some 
of the most noted Tory bouses, and were treated every 
where with the utmost respect. Upon the strictest in 
quiry I could make, I was assured, that a great majority 
of the inhabitants are stanch whigs. Sussex, they 
say, can take care of Sussex. And yet all agree that 
there are more Tories in that county than in any 
other. If the British army should get into that coun 
ty, in sufficient numbers to protect the Tories, there 
is no doubt to be made, they would be insolent 
enough, and malicious and revengeful. But there is 
no danger, at present, and will be none, until that 
event takes place. The weather has been sometimes 
bitterly cold, sometimes warm, sometimes rainy, and 
sometimes snowy, and the roads abominably hard and 
rough, so that this journey has been the most tedious 
I ever attempted. Our accommodations have been 
often very bad, but much better and cheaper than 
they would have been, if we had taken the road from 
Peekskill to Morristown, where the army lies.

Baltimore, 2 February, 1777. 

LAST evening, we arrived safe in this town, after the 
longest journey and through the worst roads and the 



180 LETTERS. 

worst weather that I have ever experienced. My hor 
ses performed extremely well. 

Baltimore is a very pretty town, situated on Pa- 
tapsco river, which empties itself into the great bay 
of Chesapeake. The inhabitants are all good Whigs, 
having some time ago banished all the Tories from 
among them. The streets are very dirty and miry, 
but every thing else is agreeable, except the mon 
strous prices of things. We cannot get a horse kept 
under a guinea a week. Our friends are well. 

The continental army is filling up fast, here and 
in Virginia. I pray that the Massachusetts may not 
fail of its quota in season. In this journey we have 
crossed four mighty rivers ; Connecticut, Hudson, 
Delaware and Susquehannah. The two first, we 
crossed upon the ice, the two last, in boats ; the last, 
we crossed a little above the place where it empties 
into Chesapeake Bay. 

I think I have never been better pleased with any 
of our American States than with Maryland. We 
saw most excellent farms all along the road, and what 
was more striking to me, I saw more sheep and flax 
in Maryland than I ever saw in riding a like distance 
in any other State. We scarce passed a farm with 
out seeing a fine flock of sheep, and scarce a house 
without seeing men or women dressing flax. Several 
times we saw women breaking and swingling this 
necessary article. 

I have been to meeting and heard my old acquaint- 
ance, Mr. Allison, a worthy clergyman of this town, 
whom I have often seen in Philadelphia.

LETTER XCII. 



Baltimore, 3 February, 1777. 

THIS day has been observed in this place with exem 
plary decency and solemnity, in consequence of an 
appointment of the government, in observance of a 
recommendation of Congress, as a day of fasting. I 
went to the Presbyterian meeting, and heard Mr. Al 
lison deliver a most pathetic and animating as well as 
pious, patriotic, and elegant discourse. I have seldom 
been better pleased or more affected with a sermon. 
The Presbyterian meeting house in Baltimore, stands 
upon a hill just at the back of the town, from whence 
we have a very fair prospect of the town and of the 
water upon which it stands, and of the country round 
it. Behind this eminence, which is the Beacon Hill 
of Baltimore, lies a beautiful meadow, which is en 
tirely encircled by a stream of water. This most 
beautiful scene must be partly natural and partly ar 
tificial. Beyond the meadow and canal, you have a 
charming view of the country. Besides the meeting 
house, there is, upon this height, a large and elegant 
Court House, as yet unfinished within, and a small 
church of England, in which an old clergyman offici 
ates, Mr. Chase, father of Mr. Chase one of the dele 
gates of Maryland, who, they say, is not so zealous a 
Whig as his son. 

I shall take opportunities to describe this town and

State more particularly to you hereafter. I shall in* 
quire into their religion, their laws, their customs, 
their manners, their descent and education, their 
learning, their schools and colleges, and their morals. 
It was said of Ulysses, I think, that he saw the man 
ners of many men and many cities, which is like to 
be my case, as far as American men and cities ex* 
tend, provided Congress should continue in the rolling 
humor, which I hope they will not I wish however 
that my mind was more at rest than it is, that I might 
be able to make more exact observation of men and 
things, as far as I go. 

When I reflect upon the prospect before me, of so 
long an absence from all that I hold dear in this world, 
1 mean, all that contributes to my private personal 
happiness, it makes me melancholy. God Almigh 
ty s providence protect and bless you, and yours and 
mine.

Baltimore, 7 February, 1777. 

I AM at last, after a great deal of difficulty, settled in 
comfortable quarters, but at an infinite expense. The 
price I pay for my board is more moderate than any 
other gentlemen give, excepting my colleagues, who 



LETTERS. 183 

are all in the same quarters and at the same rates, 
except Mr. Hancock, who keeps a house by himself. 
The prices of things here are much more intolerable 
than at Boston. The attempt of New England to 
regulate prices is extremely popular in Congress, who 
will recommend an imitation of it to the other States. 
For my own part I expect only a partial and a tempo 
rary relief from it, and I fear that, after a time, the 
evils will break out with greater violence. The wa 
ter will flow with greater rapidity for having been 
dammed up for a time. The only radical cure will 
be to stop the emission of more paper, and to draw in 
some that is already out, and devise means effectually 
to support the credit of the rest. To this end we 
must begin forthwith to tax the people as largely as 
the distressed circumstances of the country will boar. 
We must raise the interest from four to six per cent. 
We must, if possible, borrow silver and gold from 
abroad. We must, above all things, endeavor, this 
winter, to gain further advantages of the enemy, that 
our power may be in somewhat higher reputation than 
it is, or rather, than it has been.

Baltimore,? February, 1777. 

I THINK, in some letter I sent you since I left Bethle- 
w hem, I promised you a more particular account of

that carious and remarkaLie town. When we first 
came in sight of the town we found a country better 
cultivated and more agreeably diversified with pros 
pects of orchards and fields, groves and meadows, 
hills and valleys, than any we had seen. When we 
came into the town, we were directed to a public 
house, kept by a Mr. Johnson, which, I think, was the 
best inn I ever saw. It belongs, it seems, to the so 
ciety, is furnished at their expense, and is kept for 
their profit or at their loss. Here you might find 
every accommodation that you could wish for your 
self, your servants and horses, and at no extravagant 
rates neither. 

The town is regularly laid out, the streets straight 
and at right angles, like those in Philadelphia. It 
stands upon an eminence, and has a fine large brook 
flowing on one end of it, and the Lehigh, a branch of 
the Delaware, on the other. Between the town and 
the Lehigh are beautiful public gardens. They have 
carried the mechanical arts to greater perfection here 
than in any place which I have seen. They have a 
set of pumps which go by water, which force the wa 
ter up through leaden pipes from the river to the top 
of the hill, near a hundred feet, and to the top of a 
little building in the shape of a pyramid or obelisk, 
which stands upon the top of the hill, and is twenty or 
thirty feet high. From this fountain, water is con 
veyed in pipes to every part of the town. Upon the 
river they have a fine set of mills. The best grist 
mills and bolting mills that are any where to be found. 
The best fulling mills, an oil mill, a mill to grind bark

for the lanyard, a dying house where all colors are 
died, machines for shearing cloth, &c. 

There arc three public institutions here of a very 
remarkable nature. One, a society of the young men, 
another of the young \\omcn, and a third of the wid 
ows. There is a large building divided into many 
apartmenls, where the young men reside by them 
selves and carry on their several trades. They pay 
a rent to the society for their rooms and they pay 
for their board and what they earn is their own. 
There is another large building appropriated in the 
same manner to the young women. There is a gov 
erness a little like the lady abbess in some other insti 
tutions, who has the superintendence of the whole, 
and they have elders. Each apartment has a number 
of young women who are vastly industrious, some 
spinning, some weaving, others employed in all the 
most curious works in linen, wool, cotton, silver and 
gold, silk and velvet. This institution displeased me 
much. Their dress was uniform and clean, but Very 
inelegant. Their rooms were kept extremely warm 
with Dutch stoves : and the heat, the want of fresh 
air and exercise relaxed the poor girls in such a man 
ner as must, I think, destroy their health. Their 
countenances were languid and pale. 

The society of widows is very similar. Industry 
and economy are remarkable in all these institutions. 
They showed us their church, which is hung with 
pictures of our Saviour, from his birth to his death, 
resurrection and ascension. It is done with very

very elegant taste. The painter, who is still living in 
Bethlehem, hut very old, has formerly been in Italy, 
the schilol of painting. They have a very good organ 
in their church, of their own make. They have a 
public building on purpose for the reception of the 
dead, to which the corpse is carried as soon as it ex* 
pires, where it lies until the time of sepulture. 

Christian love is their professed object, but it is said 
they love money and make their public institutions 
subservient to the gratification of that passion. They 
suffer no lawsuits with one another, and as few as 
possible with other men. It is said that they now pro 
fess to be against war. They have a custom pecu 
liar respecting courtship and marriage. The elders 
pick out pairs to be coupled together, who have no 
opportunity of conversing together, more than once or 
twice, before the knot is tied. The youth of the two 
sexes have very little conversation with one another 
before marriage. 

Mr. Hassey, a very agreeable, sensible gentleman, 
who showed us the curiosities of the place, told me, 
upon inquiry, that they profess the Augsburg confes 
sion of faith, are Lutherans rather than Calvinists, dis 
tinguish between bishops and presbyters, but have no 
idea of the necessity of the uninterrupted succession, 
are very liberal and candid in their notions in oppo 
sition to bigotry, and live in charity with all denom 
inations.

Baltimore, 10 February, 1777. 

FELL S point, which I mentioned in a letter this morn 
ing, has a considerable number of houses upon it. 
The shipping all lies now at this point. You have 
from it on one side a complete view of the harbor, 
and on the other a fine prospect of the town of Balti 
more. You see the hill in full view and the court 
house, the church and meeting house upon it. The 
court house makes a haughty appearance from this 
point. There is a fortification erected on this point, 
with a number of embrasures for cannon facing the 
Narrows which make the entrance into the harbor. 
At the Narrows they have a fort with a garrison in it. 
It is now a month und a few days since I left you. 
I have heard nothing from you nor received a letter 
from the Massachusetts. I hope the post office will 
perform better than it has done. I am anxious to 
hear how you do. My duty to your papa and my 
mother. Love to brothers and sisters. Tell Betsey 
I hope she is married, though I want to throw the

We long to hear of the formation of a new army. 
We shall lose the most happy opportunity of destroy 
ing the enemy this spring if we do not exert ourselves 
instantly. We have from New Hampshire a Colonel 
Thornton, a physician by profession, a man of humor. 
He has a large budget of droll stories with which he 
entertains company perpetually. I heard, about twenty 
or five and twenty years ago, a story of a physician 
in Londonderry, who accidentally met with one of our 
New England enthusiasts, called exhor^ors. The fa 
natic soon began to examine the Doctor concerning 
the articles of his faith and what he thought of origin 
al sin. " Why," says the Doctor, " I satisfy myself 
about it in this manner. Either original sin is divisi 
ble or indivisible. If it is divisible, every descend 
ant of Adam and Eve must have a part and the share 
which falls to each individual at this day is so small a 
particle that I think it is not worth considering. If

indivisible, then the whole quantity must have de 
scended in a right line, and must now be possessed 
by one person only ; and the chances are millions and 
millions and millions to one, that that person is now in 
Asia or Africa, and thai I have nothing to do with it." 
I told Thornton the story, and that I suspected him to 
be the man. He said he was. He belongs to Lon

Baltimore, 17 February, 1777. 

IT was this day determined to adjourn, to-morrow 
week, to Philadelphia. 

Howe, as you know my opinion always was, will 
repent his mad march through the Jerseys. The 
people of that Commonwealth begin to raise their 
spirits exceedingly and to be firmer than ever. They 
are actuated by resentment now, and resentment, co 
inciding with principle, is a very powerful motive.

Congress, which takes up my time in such a manner 
that I can scarce write a line. I have not time to

try their luck. I hope they will be more lucky than 
their papa has ever been, or ever will be. I am as well 
as can be expected. How it happens I don t know, nor 
how long it will last. My disposition was naturally gay 
and cheerful, but the prospects I have ever had before 
me and these cruel times will make me melancholy. 
I, who would not hurt the hair of the head of any 
animal, I, who am always made miserable by tho 
misery of every susceptible being that comes to my 
knowledge, am obliged to hear continual accounts of 
the barbarities, the cruel murders in cold blood even 
by the most tormenting ways of starving and freezing, 
committed by our enemies, and continued accounts of 
the deaths and diseases contracted by their own im 
prudence. These accounts harrow me beyond de 
scription. These incarnate demons say in great com 
posure, that " humanity is a yankee virtue, but that 
they are governed by policy." Is there any policy 
on this side of hell, that is inconsistent with humanity ? 
I have no idea of it. I know of no policy, God is my 
witness, but this, piety, humanity and honesty are the 
best policy. Blasphemy, cruelty and villany have 
prevailed and may again. But they won t prevail 
against America in this contest, because 1 find, the 
more of them are employed, the less they succeed.

Baltimore, 21 February, 1777. 

YESTERDAY I had the pleasure of dining with Mr. 
Purviance. There are two gentlemen of this name in 
Baltimore, Samuel and Robert, eminent merchants 
and in partnership. We had a brilliant company, the 
two Mrs. Purviances, the two Lees, the ladies of the 
two Colonels R. H. and F., Mrs. Hancock and Miss 
Katy, and a young lady that belongs to the family. 
If this letter, like some other wise ones, should be in 
tercepted, I suppose I shall be called to account for 
not adjusting the rank of these ladies a little better. 
Mr. Hancock, the two Colonel Lees, Colonel Whipple, 
Colonel Page, Colonel Ewing, the two Mr. Purviances 
and a young gentleman. I fancy I have named all the 
company. How happy would this entertainment 
have been to me if I could, by a single volition, have 
transported one lady about five hundred miles. But 
alas ! this is a greater felicity than falls to my share. 
We have voted to go to Philadelphia next week. 

We have made General Lincoln a continental Ma 
jor General. We shall make Colonel Glover a Brig 
adier. I sincerely wish we could hear more from Gen 
eral Heath. Many persons are extremely dissatisfied 
with numbers of the generaf officers of the highest 
rank. I don t mean the Commander-in-chief, his 
character is justly very high, but Schuyler, Putnam, 
Spencer, Heath, are thought by very few to be 



LETTERS, 193 

capable of the great commands t\\cy hold. We 
hear of none of their heroic deeds of arms. I 
wish they would all resign. For my part I will vote 
upon the genuine principles of a republic for a new 
election of general officers annually, and every man 
shall have my consent to be left out, who does not 
give sufficient proof of his qualifications. 

I wish my lads were old enough. I would send 
every one of them into the army in some capacity or 
other. Military abilities and experience are a great 
advantage to any character.

Philadelphia, 7 March, 1777. 

THE President, who is just arrived from Baltimore, 
came in, a few minutes ago, and delivered me yours 
of February 8, which he found at Susquchannah river, 
on its way to Baltimore. It gives me great pleasure 
to find that you have received so many letters from 
me, although I knew they contained nothing of im 
portance. I feel a restraint in writing, like that which 
you complain of, and am determined to go on trifling. 
However, the post now comes regularly, and I be 
lieve you may trust it. I am anxious and impatient 
to hear of the march of the Massachusetts soldiers for 
the new army. They are much wanted.

This city is a dull place, in comparison of what it 
was. More than one half of the inhabitants have re 
moved into the country, as it was their wisdom to do. 
The remainder are chiefly Quakers, as dull as beetles. 
From these neither good is to be expected nor evil to 
be apprehended. They are a kind of neutral tribe, 
or the race of the insipids. Howe may possibly at 
tempt this town, and a pack of sordid scoundrels, 
male and female, seem to have prepared their minds 
and bodies, houses and cellars for his reception ; but 
these are few, and more despicable in character than 
number. America will lose no .ing by Howe s gain 
ing this town. No such panic will be spread by it 
now, as was spread by the expectation of it in De 
cember. However, if we can get together twenty 
thousand men by the first of April, Mr. Howe will 
scarcely cross Delaware river this year. New Jersey 
may yet be his tomb, where he will have a monument

I am very uneasy that no attempt is made at Rhode 
Island. There is but a handful left there, who might 
be made an easy prey. The few invalids, who are

Are New England men such sons of sloth and fear, 
as to lose this opportunity ? We may possibly remove 
again from hence, perhaps to Lancaster or Reading.

Philadelphia, 16 March, 1777. 

THE spring advances very rapidly, and all nature 
will soon be clothed in her gayest robes. The green 
grass which begins to show itself here and there, re 
vives in my longing imagination my little farm and 
its dear inhabitants. What pleasure has not this vile 
war deprived me of? I want to wander in my 
meadows, to ramble over my mountains, and to sit, 
in solitude, or with her who has all my heart, by the 
side of the brooks. These beautiful scenes would 
contribute more to my happiness than the sublime 
ones which surround me. I begin to suspect that J 
have not much of the grand in my composition. The 
pride and pomp of war, the continual sound of 
drums and fifes as well played as any in the world, 
the prancings and tramplings of the Light Horse, 
numbers of whom arc paraded in the streets every 
day, have no charms for me. I long for rural and 
domestic scenes, for the warbling of birds, and prattle

of my children. Don t you think I am somewhat 
poetical this morning for one of my years, and con 
sidering the gravity and insipidity of my employ 
ment ? As much as I converse with sages and heroes, 
they have very little of my love or admiration. I 
should prefer the delights of a garden to the dominion 
of a world. I have nothing of Cccsar s greatness in 
my soul. Power has not my wishes in her train. 
The Gods, by granting me health and peace and 
competence, the society of my family and friends, 
the perusal of my books and the enjoyment of my 
farm and garden, would make me as happy as my 
nature and state will bear. Of that ambition which 
has power for its object, I don t believe I have a 
spark in my heart. There are other kinds of ambi 
tion of which I have a great deal. 1 

I am now situated in a pleasant part of the town, 
in Walnut street, on the south side of it, between 
Second and Third streets, at the house of Mr. Duncan, a 
gentleman from Boston, who has a wife and three 
children. General Wolcott, of Connecticut, and 
Colonel Whipple, of Portsmouth, are with me in the 
same house. Mr. Adams has removed to Mrs, 
Cheesman s, in Fourth street, near the corner of Mar 
ket street, where he has a curious group of company, 
consisting of characters as opposite as north and 
south. Ingersoll, the stamp man and Judge of Ad-

miralty ; Sherman, an old puritan, as honest as an 
angel and as firm in the cause of American indepen 
dence as mount Atlas ; and Colonel Thornton, as droli 
and funny as Tristram Shandy. Between the fun of 
Thornton, the gravity of Sherman, and the formal 
toryism of Ingersoll, Adams will have a curious life 
of it. The landlady, too, who has buried four hus 
bands, one tailor, two shoemakers and Gilbert 
Tenant, and still is ready for a fifth, and well deserves 
him too, will add to the entertainment. Gerry and 
Lovell are yet at Miss Leonard s, under the auspices 
of Mrs. Yard. Mr. Hancock lias taken a house in 
Chestnut street, near the corner of Fourth street, near 
the State House. 



17 March.

particulars, but in general, the intelligence is very 
agreeable. I am now convinced there will be a 
general war. 



LETTER CI. 



Philadelphia, 23 March, 1777. 

" A PLOT, a plot ! a horrid plot ! Mr. A.," says my 
barber, this morning. " It must be a plot, first, bo- 
cause there is British gold in it ; second, because there

is a woman in it ; third, because there is a Jew in it ; 
fourth, because I don t know what to make of it" 
The barber means that a villain was taken up and 
examined yesterday, who appears, by his own con 
fession, to have been employed, by Lord Howe and 
Jo. Galloway, to procure pilots to conduct the fleet up 
Delaware river and through the Chevaux de Frise. 
His confidant was a woman, who is said to be kept 
by a Jew. The fellow and the woman will suffer 
for their wickedness.

Philadelphia, 31 March, 1777. 

I KNOW not the time when I have omitted to write 
you so long. I have received but three letters from 
you since we parted, and these were short ones. 
Do you write by the post ? If you do, there must 
be some legerdemain. The post comes now con 
stantly, once a week, and brings me newspapers, but 
no letters. I have ventured to write by the post, 
but whether my letters are received or not, I don t 
know. If you distrust the post, the speaker or your 
uncle Smith will find frequent opportunities of con 
veying letters. 

I never was more desirous of hearing from home, 
and never before heard so seldom. We have reports 



LETTERS. 199 

here, not very favorable to the town of Boston. It is 
said that dissipation prevails, and that toryism abounds, 
and is openly avowed at the coffee-houses. I hope 
the reports are false. Apostasies in Boston arc more 
abominable than in any other place. Toryism finds 
worse quarter here. A poor fellow detected here as 
a spy, employed, as he confesses by Lord Howe and 
Mr. Galloway, to procure pilots for Delaware river 
and for other purposes, was this day at noon executed 
on the gallows, in the presence of an immense crowd 
of spectators. His name was James Moles worth. 
He lias been Mayor s Clerk to three or four Mayors. 

I believe you will think my letters very trifling 
indeed they are. I write in trammels. Accidents 
have thrown so many letters into the hands of the 
enemy, and they take such a malicious pleasure in 
exposing them, that I choose they should have nothing 
but trifles from me to expose. For this reason I 
never write any thing of consequence from Europe, 
from Philadelphia, from camp, or any where else. 
If I could write freely, I would lay open to you the 
whole system of politics and war, and would de 
lineate all the characters in cither drama, as minutely, 
although I could not do it so elegantly, as Tully did 
in his letters to Atticus. 

We have letters however from France by a vessel 
in at Portsmouth. 1 Of her important cargo, you

drawn up at the minister s request, together with the 
articles of general confederation, and the demand for 
ships of war, agreeably to their instructions, copies of 
all which papers they gave to the Count d Aranda, the 
Spanish ambassador, to be communicated to his

The ports of France, Spain and Florence, (that is 
Leghorn in the Mediterranean) are open to the Amer 
ican cruisers upon the usual terms of neutrality. They 
write for commissions to be given to privateers, and 
for more frequent arid authentic intelligence. Great 
efforts arc now making by the British ministry to pro 
cure more troops from Germany. The princes in al 
liance with France have refused to lend any or to 
enter into any guarantee of Hanover, which England 
has been mean enough to ask, being apprehensive for 
that electorate, if she should draw from it any more 
of its troops. Four more regiments (two of them to 
be light horse,) are raising in Hesse, where there has 
been an insurrection on account of drafting the peo 
ple, and now great sums of money are distributed for 
procuring men. They talk of ten thousand men in 
all, to be sent over this spring. 

The hearts of the French are universally for us, 
and the cry is strong for immediate war with Britain.

Indeed, every thing tends that way, but the Count has 
reasons for postponing it a little longer. In the mean 
time preparations are making. They have twenty-six 
sail of the line manned and fit for the sea. Spain has 
seventeen sail in the same state, and more are fitting 
with such diligence, that they reckon to have thirty 
sail in each kingdom by April. This must have an 
immediate good effect in our favor, as it keeps the 
English fleet at bay, coops up their seamen, of whom 
they will scarce find sufficient to man their next set of 
transports, will probably keep Lord Howe s fleet more 
together, for fear of a visit, and leave us more sea 
room to prey upon their commerce, and a freer coast 
to bring in our prizes and supplies from abroad. The 
letter then mentions a circumstance much to our ad 
vantage, but this is a secret So strong is the inclina 
tion of the wealthy in France to assist us, that our Am 
bassadors have been offered a loan of two millions of 
livres, without interest, and to be repaid when the 
United States are settled in peace and prosperity. No 
conditions or securities are required. They have ac 
cepted this noble benefaction, and one half of it is 
paid into the hands of their Banker. On the strength 
of this supply, they are now in treaty for some strong 
ships.

LETTER CIV. 1 

Philadelphia, 3 April, 1777. 

As you seem so inquisitive about politics, I will in 
dulge you so far (indulge. I say. Observe that word, 
indulge ! I suppose you will say, it ought to have 
been, oblige,) as to send you a little more news from 
abroad. As foreign affairs arc now become more in 
teresting to us than ever, I dare say, your political cu 
riosity has extended itself, ere this, all over Europe. 
The agent of the King of Prussia has often made 
proposals of a commercial nature to our agents in 
France, and expressed a desire that some American 
would go to Berlin, at the instance of his sovereign, 
who wishes to have a clear idea of the nature of our 
commerce. You must know that this prince has been, 
several years, dreaming of making his port of Emb- 
den an Amsterdam. We cannot as yet depend, that 
the Dutch merchants will venture to load directly to 
America at their own risk. The States, however, 
have declared, in answer to a fresh remonstrance of 
General York, that their ports are open to all nations, 
and that their trade, to and from their own colonies, 
shall bo unmolested, their subjects complying with the

ordinances issued by their high mightinesses. Their 
prohibition of exporting warlike stores extends to all 
British subjects. Without a very material and appar 
ent success of the British arms in America, a loan 
would be very slowly negotiated for England in Am 
sterdam. Nothing hinders them now from selling out 
of the English funds, but their not knowing what to do 
with the money. For that country may be called the 
treasury of Europe, and its stock of specie is more or 
less, according to the necessities of the different prin 
ces in Europe. 

The credit of France has been very low of late. 
The mismanagement of the finances in the late King s 
reign, and the character of the late comptroller-gen 
eral, M. de Clugny, had reduced it so low, that it was 
impossible to borrow anything considerable on perpet 
ual funds. By life rents, something might be done. 
Perhaps a financier, in whose probity the world have 
a confidence, may restore their credit. The French 
stocks rose on the appointment of M. Taboureau. 
That it is possible for France to borrow, is certain, 
for at the time when M. Turgot was removed, he was 
negotiating a loan, and was likely to succeed, for six 
ty millions of guilders. The credit of Spain is ex 
tremely good. That kingdom may have what money 
it will, and on the best terms. The Emperor s credit 
is also good, not as Emperor, but from his hereditary 
dominions. Sweden and Denmark have good credit, 
the first the best. They have money at four per cent, 
and it is not long since the King of Sweden borrowed 
three millions of guilders at that interest, to pay off 



LETTERS. 205 

V 

old debts at five per cent. His interest is paid punc 
tually. Prussia has no credit, but his treasury is full 
by squeezing the last farthing from his people, and 
now and then he draws a little money from Holland, 
by reviving obsolete claims. The credit of the em 
press of Russia is very good, for she has punctually paid 
the interest of twelve millions of guilders, which she 
borrowed in her war with the Turk, and has lately 
paid off one million and a half of the principal. These 
arc the strongest recommendations to a mercantile 
people. As to America, in the present state of affairs, 
it is not probable that a loan is practicable, but should 
it appear evident that we are likely to support our in 
dependency, or should either France or Spain ac 
knowledge it, in either of these cases, we might have 
money, and when it shall be seen that we are punctual 
in our first payments of the interest, we shall have as 
much as we please. 



LETTER CV. 



Philadelphia, C April, 1777. 

You have had many rumors propagated among you 
which I suppose you know not how to account for. 
One was, that Congress, the last summer, had tied the 
hands of General Washington, and would not let him 
fight, particularly on the White plains. This report 



206 LETTERS. 

was totally groundless. Another was, that at last, 
Congress untied the General, and then he instantly 
fought and conquered at Trenton. This also was 
without foundation, for as his hands were never tied, 
so they were not untied. Indeed, within a few days 
past, a question has been asked Congress, to the sur 
prise, I believe, of every member there, whether the 
General was bound by the advice of a council of war ? 
No member of Congress, that I know of, ever har 
bored or conceived such a thought. " Taking the ad 
vice of a council of war " are the words of the Gen 
eral s instructions, but this meant only, that councils 
of war should be called and their opinions and reasons 
demanded, but the General, like all other command 
ers of armies, was to pursue his own judgment after 
all. 

Another re port, which has been industriously circu 
lated, is, that the General has been made by Congress, 
dictator. But this is as false as the other stories. 
Congress, it is true, upon removing to Baltimore, gave 
the General power to raise fifteen battalions, in addi 
tion to those which were ordered to be raised before, 
and to appoint the officers, and also, to raise three 
thousand horse, and to appoint their officers, and also, 
to take necessaries for his army, at an appraised value. 
But no more. Congress never thought of making him 
dictator, or of giving him a sovereignty. I wish I 
could find a correspondent, who was idle enough to 
attend to every report, and write it to me. Such 
false news, uncont radio ted, does more or less harm. 
Such a collection of lies would be a curiosity for pos 
terity. 



LETTERS. 207 

The report you mention in your last, that the Brit 
ish administration had proposed to Congress a treaty 
and terms, is false, and without a color. On the con 
trary, it is now more than ever p&lt;.st a douht, that their 
fixed determination is, conquest and unconditional sub 
jugation. But there will be many words and blows 
too, before they will accomplish their wishes. Poor, 
abandoned, infatuated nation ! Infatuation is one of 
the causes to which great historians ascribe many 
events, and if it ever produced any effect, it has pro 
duced this war against America. 

Arnold, who carries this, was taken in his passage from 
Baltimore. He sailed with Harden for Boston. They 
took fifteen vessels while he was on board the man of 
war. Your flour was highly favored with good luck.

seen him to be these two yean. He is in total neg 
lect and disgrace here. I am sorry for it, because of 
the forward part he took in the beginning of the con 
troversy. But there is certainly such a thing as fall 
ing away in politics, if there is none in grace. 

Lee fares as well as a man in close prison can fare, 
I suppose, constantly guarded and watched. I fancy 
Howe will engage that he shall be treated as a pris 
oner of war, and in that case we shall all be easy. 
For my own part I don l think the cause depends 
upon him. I am sorry to see such wild panegyrics 
m your newspapers. I wish they would consider the 
wars against idolatry.

Congress is now full. Every one of the thirteen 
States has a representation in it, which has not hap

have made it lawful for their officers to enlist servants 
and apprentices.

Alexander, has sailed down the river. I stood upon

overcame avarice. 



LETTER CVII. 



[Philadelphia], Sunday, 13 April, 1777. 

ENCLOSED with this, you have a correspondence be 
tween the two Generals concerning the cartel for the 
exchange of prisoners. Washington is in the right, 
and has maintained his argument with a delicacy and 
dignity, which do him much honor, lie has hinted at 
the flagitious conduct of the two Howes towards their 
prisoners in so plain and clear a manner that he can 
not be misunderstood, but yet a decency and a deli 
cacy are preserved, which is the more to be applaud 
ed, because the natural resentment of such atrocious 
cruelties renders it very difficult to avoid a more 
pointed language in describing them. They might, 
indeed, without much impropriety have been painted 
in crimson colors of a deeper die. If Mr. Howe s 
heart is not callous, what must be his feelings when

ho recollects the standings, the freezings, the pestilen 
tial diseases, with which he coolly and deliberately 
destroyed the lives of so many unhappy men ! If 
his conscience is not seared, how will he bear its 
lashes when he remembers his breach of honor, his 
breach of faith, his offence against humanity and di 
vinity, his neighbor, and his God (if he thinks there is 
any such Supreme Being,) in impairing health that he 
ought to have cherished, and in putting an end to lives 
that he ought to have preserved, and in choosing the 
most slow, lingering and torturing death that he could 
have devised. I charitably suppose, however, that he 
would have chosen the shortest course and would have 
put every man to the sword or bayonet, and thereby 
have put an end to their sufferings at once, if he could 
have done it without detection. But this would have 
been easily proved upon him, both by friends and en 
emies, whereas, by hunger, frost and disease he might 
commit the murders with equal certainty, and yet be 
able to deny that he had done it. He might lay it to 
hurry, to confusion, to the fault of commissaries and 
other officers; nay, might deny that they were 
starved, frozen, and infected. He was determined to 
put them out of the way and yet to deny it ; to get 
rid of his enemies and yet save his reputation. But 
his reputation is ruined forever. 

The two brothers will be ranked by posterity with 
Pizarro, with Borgia, with Alva, and with others in 
the annals of infamy, whose memories are entitled to 
the hisses and execrations of all virtuous men. These 
two unprincipled men are the more detestable, because 



LETTERS. 211 

they were in the opposition at home, their connex 
ions, friendships and interest lay with the opposition ; 
to the opposition they owed their rise, promotion and 
importance. Yet they have basely deserted their 
friends and party, and have made themselves the ser 
vile tools of the worst of men in the worst of causes. 
But what will not desperate circumstances tempt men 
to do, who are without principle and who have a 
strong, aspiring ambition, a towering pride and a tor 
menting avarice ? These two Howes were very poor, 
and they have spent the little fortunes they had in 
bribery at elections, and having obtained scats in Par 
liament, and having some reputation as brave men, 
they had nothing to do but to carry their votes and 
their valor to market, and, it is very true, they have 
sold them at a high price. 

Are titles of honor the reward of infamy ? Is gold 
a compensation for vice ? Can the one or the other 
give that pleasure to the heart, that comfort to the 
mind, which it derives from doing good ? from a con 
sciousness of acting upon upright and generous prin 
ciples, of promoting the cause of right, freedom and 
the happiness of men ? Can wealth, or titles soften 
the pains of the mind upon reflecting that a man has 
done evil and endeavored to do evil to millions, that 
lie has destroyed free governments, and established ty 
rannies? I would not be a Howe for all the empires 
of the earth and all the riches and glories thereof. 
Who would not rather be brave even though unfortu 
nate in the cause of liberty ? who would not rather be 
Sidney* than Monk ? 



212 LETTERS. 

However, if I am not deceived, misfortune as well 
as infamy awaits these men. They are doomed to de 
feat and destruction. It may take time to effect it, 
but it will certainly come. America is universally 
convinced of the necessity of meeting them in the 
field in firm battalion, and American fire is terrible. 



LETTER CVIII. 

[Philadelphia], 13 April, 1777. 

I HAVE spent an hour this morning in the congrega 
tion of the dead. I took a walk into the Potter s field, 
a burying ground between the new stone prison and 
the hospital, and I never in my whole life was affect 
ed with so much melancholy. The graves of the 
soldiers, who have been buried in this ground from 
the hospital and bettering house during the course of 
the last summer, fall and winter, dead of the small 
pox and camp diseases, are enough to make the heart 
of stone to melt away. The sexton told me that up 
wards of two thousand soldiers had been buried there, 
and by the appearance of the graves and trenches, it 
:i most probable to me, he speaks within bounds. 
To what causes this plague is to be attributed I don t 
know. It seems to me that the want of tents, clothes, 
soap, vegetables, vinegar, vaults, &c., cannot account 
for it all. Oat meal and peas are a great preservative 



LETTERS. 213 

of our enemies. Our frying pans and gridirons slay 
more than the sword. Discipline, discipline is the 
great thing wanted. There can be no order nor 
cleanliness in an army without discipline. We have 
at last determined on a plan for the sick, and have 
called into the service the best abilities in physic and 
chirurgery that the continent affords. I pray God it 
may have its desired effect, and that the lives and 
health of the soldiers\may be saved by it. Disease 
has destroyed ten men for us, where the sword of the 
enemy has killed one. 

I Upon my return from my pensive, melancholy 

walk, I heard a piece of disagreeable news. That the 
ship Morris, Captain Anderson, from Nantes, with can 
non, arms, gun-locks, powder, &c., was chased into 
Delaware Bay by two or three men of war ; that she 
defended herself manfully against their boats and bar 
ges, but finding no possibility of getting clear, she ran 



aground. The crew and two French gentlemen pas 
sengers got on shore, but the Captain, determined to 
disappoint his enemy in part, laid a train and blew up 
the ship, and lost his own life, unfortunately, in the 
explosion. I regret the loss of so brave a man much 
more than that of the ship and cargo. The people 
are fishing in order to &ave what they can, and I 
hope they will save the cannon. The French gentle 
men, it is said, have brought despatches from France 
to the Congress. I hope this is true. If it is, I will 
let you know the substance of it, if I may be permit 
ted to disclose it.

WE hare now an ample representation from New

as any men ever were or can be. There is a new

MY barber 1ms just left the chamber. The following 
curious dialogue was the amusement during the gay 
moments of shaving. 

" Well, Burne, what is the lie of the day ? " " Sir, 

Mr told me, that a privateer from Baltimore has 

taken two valuable prizes with sixteen guns each. I 
can scarcely believe it." " Have you heard of the 
success of the Rattlesnake, of Philadelphia, and the 
Sturdy Bcgqar, of Maryland, Mr. Burne ? These two 
privateers have taken eleven prizes, and sent them 
into the West India Islands ; nine transports and two 
guinea men." "Confound the ill luck, Sir; I was 
going to sea myself on board the Rattlesnake, and 
my wife fell a yelping. These wives arc queer 
things. I told her, I wondered she had no more 
ambition." " Now," says I, " when you walk the 
streets and any body asks who that is ? The answer is 
" Burne the barber s wi/e," Should you not be better 
pleased to hear it said, " That is Captain Burners la 
dy" the captain of marines on board the Rattlesnake ? " 
" O," says she, * I would rather be called Burne the 
barber s wife, than Captain Burners widow. I don t 
desire to live better than you maintain me, my dear." 
So it is, Sir, by this sweet, honey language, I am

soap and razors and pincers and combs. I wish she 
had my ambition. 9 

If this letter should be intercepted by the Tories, 
they will get a booty. Let them enjoy it If some 
of their wives had been as tender and discreet as the 
barber s, their husbands ambition would not have led 
them into so many salt ponds. What an ignis fatuus 
this ambition is ? How few of either sex have arrived 
at Mrs. Burne s pitch of moderation, and are able to 
say, " I don t desire to live better, and had rather be 
the Barber s wife, than the Captain s widow " ! Quite 
smart, I think, as well as philosophical. 



LETTER CXI. 



[Philadelphia], Saturday Evening, 26 April, 1777. 

I HAVE been lately more remiss than usual in writing 
to you. There has been a great dearth of news. 
Nothing from England, nothing from France, Spain 
or any other part of Europe, nothing from the West 
Indies nothing from Howe and his banditti, nothing 
from General Washington. There are various con 
jectures that Lord Howe is dead, sick, or gone to 
England, as the proclamations run in the name of 
Will. Howe only, and nobody from New York can 
tell any thing of his lordship. 



LETTERS. V 

I am wearied out with expectations that the Massa 
chusctls troops would have arrived, ere now, at Head 
Quarters. Do our people intend to leave the con 
tinent in the lurch? Do they mean to submit? or 
what fatality attends them? With the noblest prize 
in view that ever mortals contended for, and with the 
fairest prospect of obtaining it upon easy terms, the 
people of the Massachusetts Bay are dead. Docs our 
state intend to send only half, or a third of their 
quota ? Do they wish to see another crippled, dis 
astrous and disgraceful campaign, for want of an 
army ? I am more sick and more ashamed of my 
own countrymen, than ever I was before. The 
spleen, the vapors, the dismals, the horrors seem to 
have seized our whole state. More wrath than terror 
has seized rne. I am very mad. The gloomy 
cowardice of the times is intolerable in New England. 
Indeed I feel not a little out of humor from indis 
position of body. You know I cannot pass a spring, 
or fall without an ill turn, and I have had one these 
four or five weeks. A cold as usual. Warm weather 
and a little exercise with a little medicine, I suppose, 
will cure me, as usual. I am not confined, but mope 
about and drudge, as usual, like a galley slave. I 
am a fool, if ever there was one, to be such a slave. 
I won t be much longer. I will be more free in 
some world or other. Is it not intolerable, that the 
opening spring, which I should enjoy with my wife 
and children, upon my little farm, should pass away, 
and laugh at me for laboring, day after day, and 
month after month, in a conclave, where neither taste, 




218 LETTERS. 

nor fancy, nor reason, nor passion* nor appetite can 
be gratified ? 

Posterity ! you will never know how much it cost 
the present generation to preserve your freedom! 
I hope you will mak a good use of it If you do 
not, I shall repent in Heaven that I ever took half 
the pains to preserve it. 



LETTER CXII. 



[Philadelphia], 27 April, 1777. 

YOUR favors of April 2d and 7th I have received. 
The enclosed Evening Post will give you some idea 
of the humanity of the present race of Britons. My 
barber, whom I quote as often as ever I did any au 
thority, says, " he has read histories of cruelty and he 
has read romances of cruelty, but the cruelty of the 
British exceeds all that he ever read." For my own 
part I think we cannot dwell too much on this part of 
their character and conduct It is full of important 
lessons. If the facts only were known, in the utmost 
simplicity of narration, they would strike every pious 
and humane bosom in Great Britain with horror. 
Every conscience in that country is not callous, nor 
every heart hardened. The plainest relation of facts 
would interest the sympathy and compassion of all 
Europe in our favor. And it would convince every 



LETTERS. 219 

American, that a nation, so great a part of which is 
thus deeply depraved, can never be again trusted with 
power over us. I think that not only history should 
perform her office, but painting, sculpture, statuary 
and poetry ought to assist, in publishing to the world 
and perpetuating to posterity, the horrid deeds of our 
enemies. It will show the persecution we suffer in 
defence of our rights ; it will show the fortitude, pa 
tience, perseverance, and magnanimity of Americans, 
in as strong a light as the barbarity and impiety of 
Briton, in this persecuting war. Surely impiety con 
sists in destroying with such hellish barbarity the ra 
tional works of the Deity, as much as in blaspheming 
and defying his majesty. 

If there is a moral law, if there is a divine law, 
(and that there is, every intelligent creature is con 
scious,) to trample on these laws, to hold them in con 
tempt and defiance is the highest exertion of wicked 
ness and impiety that mortals can be guilty of. The 
author of human nature, who can give it its rights, will 
not sec it ruined, and suffer its destroyers to escape 
with impunity. Divine vengeance will, sometime or 
other, overtake the Alberts, the Philips and Georges, 
the Alvas, the Grislers, and Howes, and vindicate the 
wrongs of oppressed human nature. I think that 
medals in gold, silver and copper ought to be struck in 
commemoration of the shocking cruelties, the brutal 
barbarities, and the diabolical impieties of this war ; 
and these should be contrasted with the kindness, 
tenderness, humanity and philanthropy which have 
marked the conduct of Americans towards their pris- 



220 LETTERS. 

oners. It is remarkable that the officers and soldiers 
of our enemies are so totally depraved, so completely 
destitute of the sentiments of philanthropy in their 
own hearts, that they cannot believe that such deli 
cate feelings can exist in any other, and therefore 
have constantly ascribed that milk and honey with 
which we have treated them, to fear, cowardice and 
conscious weakness. But in this they are mistaken, 
and will discover their mistake too late to answer any 
good purpose for them.

THERE is a clock calm at this time in the political and 
military hemispheres. The surface is smooth and the 
air serene. Not a breath nor a wave, no news nor 
noise. 

Nothing would promote our cause more than Howe s 
march to this town. Nothing quickens and deter 
mines people so much as a little smart. The Ger 
mans, who are numerous and wealthy in this State, 
and who have very imperfect ideas of freedom, have 
a violent attachment to property. They are passion 
ate and vindictive, in a degree that is scarcely credi 
ble to persons who are unacquainted with them, and 
the least injury to their property excites a resentment

beyond description. A few houses and plantations 
plundered, (as many would be if Howe should come 
here,) would set them all on fire. Nothing would 
unite and determine Pennsylvania so effectually. 
The passions of men must cooperate with their rea 
son in the prosecution of a war. The public may be 
clearly convinced, that a war is just, a.id yet, until 
their passions arc excited, will carry it languidly on. 
The prejudices, the anger, the hatred of the English 
against the French contributes greatly to their valor 
and success. The British court and their officers hove 
studied to excite the same passions in the breasts of 
their soldiers against the Americans, well knowing 
their powerful effects. We, on the contrary, have 
treated their characters with too much tenderness. 
The Howes, their officers, and soldiers too, ought to 
be held up to the contempt, derision, hatred and ab 
horrence of the populace in every State, and of the 
common soldiers in every army. It would give me 
no pain to sec them burned or hanged in effigy, in 
every town and village.

oners last year, added to an act of Parliament, which 
they have made, to enable them to send prisoners to 
England, to be there murdered with still more relent 
less cruelty in prisons, will bring our officers and sol

This maxim u CONQUEROR DIE " never failed to raise a

WE have no news here, except what we get from 
your country. The privateers act with great spirit, 
and are blessed with remarkable success. Some 
merchant ships are arrived this week from Ma ry land. 
They were first chased by men of war in attempting 
to get into Chesapeake Bay. They ran from them 
and attempted Delaware Bay. There they were 
chased again, whereupon they again shifted their

course for Chesapeake, and got in safe, in spite of all 
the men of war could do. Thus you sec, we can and 
will have trade in spite of them, and this trade will 
probahly increase fast. It requires time for the stream 
of commerce to alter its channel. Time is necessary 
for our merchants and foreign merchants to think, 
plan, and correspond with each other. Time, also, is 
necessary for our masters of vessels and mariners to 
become familiar with the coasts, forts and harbors of 
foreign countries, and a longer time still is needful for 
French, Spanish and Dutch masters and mariners to 
learn our coasts and harbors. 

Yours ever, ever yours.

THE day before yesterday, I took a walk with my 
friend \VhippIc to Mrs. Wells s, the sister of the fa 
mous Mrs. Wright, 1 to see her wax-work. She has 
two chambers filled with it. In one, the parable of 
the prodigal son is represented. The prodigal is

prostrate on his knees before his father, whose joy 
and grief and compassion all appear in his eyes and 
face struggling with each other. A servant maid, at 
the father s command, is pulling down from a closet 
shelf the choicest robes to clothe the prodigal, who is 
all in rags. At an outward door in a corner of the 
room, stands the brother, chagrined at this festivity, a 
servant coaxing him to come in. A large number of 
guests are placed round the room. In another cham 
ber are the figures of Chatham, Franklin, Sawbridge, 
Mrs. Macauley and several others. At a corner is 
a miser, sitting at his table weighing his gold, his bag 
upon one side of the table and a thief behind him en 
deavoring to pilfer the bag. 

There is genius as well as taste and art discovered 
in this exhibition. But I must confess the whole 
scene was disagreeable to me. The imitation of life 
was too faint, and I seemed to be walking among a 
group of corpses, standing, sitting and walking, laugh 
ing, singing, crying and weeping. This art, I think, 
will make but little progress in the world. 

Another historical piece, I forgot, which is Elisha 
restoring to life the Shunamite s son. The joy of the 
mother upon discovering the first symptoms of life in 
the child is pretty strongly expressed. Dr. Chevot s 
wax-work in which all the various parts of the human 
body are represented for the benefit of young students 
in anatomy, and of which I gave you a particular 
description a year or two ago, were much more pleas 
ing to me. Wax is much fitter to represent dead 
bodies than living ones.

Upon a hint from one of our commissioners abroad, 
we are looking about for American curiosities to send

tie, I lead & lonely, melancholy life, mourning the loss 
of all the charms of life, which are my family, and 
all the amusements that I ever had in life, which is 
my farm. If the warm weather, which is now com 
ing on, should not cure my cold, and make me bet 
ter, 1 must come home. If it should, and I should 
get tolerably comfortable, I shall stay and reconcile 
myself to the misery I here suffer, as well as I can. 
I expect that I shall be chained to this oar until my 
constitution both of mind and body are totally destroy 
ed and rendered wholly useless to myself and family 
for the remainder of my days. 

However, now we have got over the dreary, dis 
mal, torpid winter, when we had no army, not even 
three thousand men to protect us against all our ene 
mies, foreign and domestic, and now we have got to 
gether a pretty respectable army, which renders us 
tolerably secure against both, I doubt not we shall be 
able to persuade some gentleman or other in the Mas 
sachusetts to vouchsafe to undertake the dangerous 
office of delegate to Congress. However, I will 
neither whine nor croak. The moment our affairs are 
in a prosperous way and a little more out of doubt, 
that moment I become a private gentleman, the re 
spectful husband of the amiable Mrs. A., of B., and 
the affectionate father of her children, two characters 
which I have scarcely supported for these three years 
past, having done the duties of neither.

Philadelphia, 17 May, 1777. 

I NEVER fail to enclose to you the newspapers, which 
contain the most of the intelligence that comes to my 
knowledge. I am obliged to slacken my attention to 
business a little, and ride and walk for the sake of my 
health, which is but infirm. O ! that I could wander 
upon Perm s hill and in the meadows and mountains 
in its neighborhood, free from care ! But this is a fe 
licity too great for me. 

Mr. Gorham and Mr. Russel are here with a peti 
tion from Charlestown. It grieves me that they arc to 
return without success. I feel, most exquisitely, for 
the unhappy people of that town. Their agents have 
done every thing in their power or in the power of 
men to do, and the Massachusetts delegates have se 
conded their efforts to the utmost of their power, but 
all in vain. The distress of the States, arising from 
the quantity of money abroad, and the monstrous de 
mands that would be made from Virginia, New Jer 
sey, New York and elsewhere, if a precedent should 
be once set, has determined the Congress, almost with 
tears in their eyes, to withstand this application at 
present. Every man expressed the utmost tender 
ness and humanity upon the occasion : but at the some 
time, every man, except the Massachusetts delegates, 
expressed his full conviction of the ill policy of grant 
ing any thing at present.

[Philadelphia], 22 May, 4 o clock in the rooming. 

AFTER a series of the severest and harshest weather 
that ever I felt in this climate, we are at last blessed 
with a bright sun and a soft air. The weather here 
has been like our old easterly winds to me and south 
erly winds to you. The charms of the morning at 
this hour are irresistible. The streaks of glory dawn 
ing in the east ; the freshness and purity in the air, 
the bright blue of the sky, the sweet warblings of a 
great variety of birds intermingling with the martial 
clarions of a hundred cocks now within my hearing, 
all conspire to cheer the spirits. 

This kind of puerile description is a very pretty em 
ployment for an old fellow whose brow is furrowed 
with the cares of politics and war. 1 shall be on 
horseback in a few minutes and then I shall enjoy the 
morning in more perfection. I spent last evening at

death with the wrangles between military officers, 
high and low. They quarrel like cats and dogs. 
They worry one another like mastiffs, scrambling for 
rank and pay, like apes for nuts. I believe there is 
no one principle which predominates in human nature 
so much, in every stage of life, from the cradle to the 
grave, in males and females, old and young, black 
and white, rich and poor, high and low, as this pas 
sion for superiority. Every human being compares 
itself in its imagination with every other round about 
it, and will find some superiority over every other, 
real or imaginary, or it will die of grief and vexation. 
I have seen it among boys and girls at school, among 
lads at college, among practitioners at the bar, among 
the clergy in their associations, among clubs of friends, 
among the people in town meetings, among the mem 
bers of a House of Representatives, among the grave 
councillors, on the more solemn bench of Justice, and 
in that awfully august body, the Congress, and on ma 
ny of its committees, and among ladies every where ; 
but I never saw it operate with such keenness, fero 
city and fury, as among military officers. They will 
go terrible lengths in their emulation, their envy and 
revenge, in consequence of it.

babes are all well. My duty to my mother and your

[Philadelphia], 25 May, 1777. 

AT half past four this morning I mounted my horse 
and took a ride in a road that was new to me. I 
went to Kensington and then to " Point-no-point" by 
land, the place where I went once before with a large 
company in the row galleys by water. That frolic 
was almost two years ago. I gave you a relation of 
it in the time, I suppose. The road to Point-no-point 
lies along the river Delaware, in fair sight of it and 
its opposite shore. For near four miles the road is 
as strait as the streets of Philadelphia. On each side, 
are beautiful rows of trees, buttonwoods, oaks, wal 
nuts, cherries and willows, especially down towards 
the banks of the river. The meadows, pastures and 
grass plats are as green as leeks. There are many 
fruit trees and fine orchards set with the nicest

regularity. But the fields of grain, the rye and wheat 
exceed all description. These fields arc all sown in 
ridges and the furrow between each couple of ridges 
is as plainly to be seen as if a swath had been 
mown along. Yet it is no wider than a ploughshare 
and it is as strait as an arrow. It looks as if the 
sower had gone along the furrow with his spectacles 
to pick up every grain that should accidentally fall 
into it. The corn is just coming out of the ground. 
The furrows struck out for the hills to be planted in, 
are each way as straight, as mathematical right lines ; 
and the squares between every four hills as exact as 
they could be done by plumb and line, or scale and 
compass. 

I am ashamed of our farmers. They are a lazy, \ 
ignorant set ; in husbandry, I mean ; for they know j 
infinitely more of every thing else than these. But 
after all, the native face of our country, diversified as 
it is with hill and dale, sea and land, is to me more 
agreeable than this enchanting artificial scene.

The post brought me yours of May 6th and 9th. 
You express apprehensions that we may be driven 
from this city. We have no such apprehensions 
here. Howe is unable to do any thing but by stealth.

LETTER CXZI. 
[Philadelphia], Monday 2 June, 1777. 

ARTILLERY Election! I wish I was at it or near 
it Yours of the 18th reached me this morning. 
The cause that letters are so long in travelling is, that 
there is but one post in a week, who goes from hence 
to Peekskill, although there are two that go from 
thence to Boston. Riding every day has made me 
better than I was, although I am not yet quite well. 
I am determined to continue this practice, which is 
Tery necessary for me. 

I rejoice to find that the town have had the wisdom 
to send but one Representative. The House last year 
was too numerous and unwieldy. The expense was 
too great. I suppose you will have a constitution 
formed this year. Who will be the Moses, the Ly- 
curgus, the Solon? or have you a score or two of 
such ? Whoever they may be, and whatever form 
may be adopted, I am persuaded there is among the 



LETTERS. 233 

mass of our people a fund of wisdom, integrity and 
humanity, which will preserve their happiness in a 
tolerable measure. 

If the enemy comes to Boston again, fly with your 
little ones, all of them to Philadelphia. But they 
will scarcely get to Boston this campaign. I admire 
your sentiments concerning revenge. Revenge in 
ancient days, (you will sec it through the whole Ro 
man History) was esteemed a generous and an heroic 
passion. Nothing was too good for a friend, or too 
bad for an enemy. Hatred and malice without limits 
against an enemy were indulged, were justified, and 
no cruelty was thought unwarrantable. Our Saviour 
taught the immorality of revenge, and the moral duty of 
forgiving injuries, and even the duty of loving enemies. 
Nothing can shew the amiable, the moral, the di 
vine excellency of these Christian doctrines in a 
stronger point of light than the characters and con 
duct of Marius and Sylla, Crcsar, Pompey, Antony 
and Augustus, among innumerable others. Retalia 
tion we must practise in some instances, in order to 
make our barbarous foes respect, in some degree, the 
rights of humanity. But this will never be done with 
out the most palpable necessity. The apprehension 
of retaliation alone will restrain them from cruelties 
which would disgrace savages. To omit it then would 
bo crucify to ourselves, our officers and men. 

We are amused here with reports of troops remov 
ing from Rhode Island, New York, Staten Island, &c ; 
waggons, boats, bridges, &c., prepared ; two old 
Indiamen cut down into floating batteries, mounting 



LETTERS. 

thirty-two guns, sent round into Delaware river, &c., 
&c ; but I heed it no more than the whistling of the 
zephyrs. In short, I had rather they should come to 
Philadelphia than not. It would purify this city of 
its dross. Either the furnace of affliction would re 
fine it of its impurities, or it would be purged yet so 
as by fire. This town has been a dead weight upon 
us. It would be a dead weight upon the enemy. 
The mules here would plague them more than all 
their money. 



LETTER CXXII. 



Philadelphia, 4 June, 1777. 

I WISH I could know whether your season is cold or 
warm, wet or dry, fruitful or barren ; whether you 
had late frosts, whether those frosts have hurt the 
fruit, the flax, the corn or vines, &c. We have a fine 
season here and a bright prospect of abundance. 

You will see, by the enclosed papers in a letter 
from my friend Parsons, a very handsome narration of 
one of the prettiest exploits of this war, a fine retalia 
tion of the Danbury mischief. Meigs, who was be 
fore esteemed a good officer, has acquired, by this ex 
pedition, a splendid reputation. You will see, by the 
same papers, too, that the writers here in opposition to 
the constitution of Pennsylvania are making factious

use of my name and lucubrations ; much against my will, 
I assure you, for although lam no admirer of the form of 
this government, yet I think it is agreeable to the body 
of the people, and if they please themselves, they will 
please me. And I would not choose to be impressed 
into the service of one parly or the other, and I am 
determined I will not enlist. Besides, it is not very 
genteel in these writers to put my name to a letter 1 
from which I cautiously withheld if myself. Howev 
er, let them take their own way, I shall not trouble 
myself about it. 

I am growing better by exercise and air.

I rejoice at your fine season and at my brother 
C ranch s attention to husbandry. I am very glad he 
bought the farm and that he likes it so well. I pant 
for domestic life and rural felicity like his. I am 
better than I have been. But I dread the heats which 
are coming on. This day completes six months since 
I left you. I am wasted and exhausted in mind and 
body, with incessant applications to business, but if I 
can possibly endure it, will hold out the year. It is 
nonsense to dance backwards and forwards. After 
this year, I shall take my leave. 

Our affairs are in a fine prosperous train, and if 
they continue so, I can leave this station with honor. 
Next month completes three years that I have been 
devoted to the service of liberty. A slavery it has 
been to me, whatever the world may think of it. To 
a man whose attachments to his family are as strong 
as mine, absence alone from such a wife and such 
children would be a great sacrifice. But in addition to 
this separation what have I not done ? What have I 
not suffered ? What have I not hazarded ? These are 
questions that I may ask you, but I will ask such ques 
tions of none else. Let the cymbals of popularity 
tinkle still. Let the butterflies of fame glitter with 
their wings. I shall envy neither their music nor their 
colors. The loss of property affects me little. All 
other hard things I despise, but the loss of your com 
pany and that of my dear babes for so long a time, I 
consider as a loss of so much solid happiness. The 
tender social feelings of my heart which have dis 
tressed me beyond all utterance in my most busy ac- 



LETTERS, 237 

live scenes as well as in the numerous hours of mel 
ancholy solitude, arc known only to God and my own 
soul. 

How often have I seen my dearest friend, a widow, 
and her charming prattlers, orphans exposed to all 
the insolence of unfeeling, impious tyrants ! Yet I can 
appeal to my final Judge, the horrid vision has never 
for one moment shaken the resolution of my heart.

MT DKAKEST FRIESD, 

We have had no news from camp for three or four 
days. Mr. Howe, by the last advices, was manoeuvring 
his fleet arid army in such a manner as give us expec 
tations of an expedition, somewhere ; but whether to 
Rhode Island, Halifax, up the North River, or the Del 
aware, is left to conjecture. I am much in doubt 
whether he knows his own intentions. A faculty of 
penetrating into the designs of an enemy is said to be 
the first quality of a general, but it is impossible to 
discover the designs of an enemy who has no design 
at all An intention that has no existence, a plan 
that is not laid, cannot be divined. Be his intentions 
what they may, you have nothing to fear from him. 
He has not force to penetrate the country any where.

MY DEAREST FKIEM),

certainly tell what it is. I am much afraid we shall 
Jose that post, as we did forts Washington and Lee ; 
and indeed, I believe we shall, if the enemy surround 
it. But it will prove no benefit to him. I begin to 
wisli there was not a fort upon the continent. _ Disci 
pline and disposition are our resources. It is oi-r pol 
icy to draw the enemy into the country, where we 
can avail ourselves of hills, woods, rivers, defiles, &c., 
until our soldiers arc more inured to war. Howe and 
Burgoyne will not be able to meet this year, and if they 
were met, it would only be better for us, for we should 
draw all our forces to a point too. If they were met, 
they could not cut ofFthe communication between the 
northern and southern States. But if the communi 
cation was cut off for a time, it would be no misfor 
tune, for New England would defend itself, and the 
southern States would defend themselves. 
Colonel Miles is come out of New York on his parole. 
His account is, as I am informed, that Mr. Howe s 
projects are all deranged. His army has gone round 
the circle, and is now encamped in the very spot 
where he was a year ago. The spirits of the To r! es 
are sunk to a great degree, and those of the army too. 
The Tories have been elated with prospects of com 
ing to this city and triumphing, but are miserably dis 
appointed. The Hessians arc disgusted, and their 
general de Heister gone home in a miff.

LETTER CXXV1.* 



[Philadelphia], 11 August, 1777. 

TOUR kind favor of July 30th and 31st, 1 was banded 
me just now from the post office. I have regularly 
received a letter from you, every week excepting one, 
for a long time past, and as regularly send a line to 
you enclosing papers. My letters are scarcely worth 
sending. Indeed I don t choose to indulge much 
speculation, lest a letter should miscarry, and free 
sentiments upon public affairs intercepted from me 
might do much hurt. 

Where the scourge of God and the plague of man 
kind is gone, no one can guess. An express from 
Smnepuxent, a place between the Capes of Delaware 
and the Capes of Chesapeake, informs, that a fleet of 
one hundred sail was seen off" that place last Thurs 
day. But whether this is fishermen s news, like that 
from Cape Ann, I know not. The time spends, and 
the campaign wears away, and Howe makes no great 
figure ytt How many men and horses will he crip 
ple by this strange coasting voyage of five weeks ? 

We have given New England men what they will 
think a complete triumph in the removal of Generals 
from the northward and sending Gates there. I hope 
every part of New England will now exert itself to 

1 Letters of Mra. Adams, Vol. I. p. 110. 



LETTERS. 241 

its utmost efforts. Never was a more glorious oppor 
tunity than Burgoyne has given us of destroying him 
by marching down so far towards Albany. Let New 
England turn out and cut off his retreat. Pray, continue 
to write me every week. You have made me merry 
with the female frolic with the miser. But I hope the 
females will leave off their attachment to coffee. I 
assure you the best families in this place have left off, 
in a great measure, the use of West India goods. We 
must bring ourselves to live upon the produce of our 
own country. What would I give for some of 
your cider ? Milk has become the breakfast of many 
of the wealthiest and genteelest families here. 

Fenno put me into a kind of frenzy to go home, by 
the description he gave me, last night, of the fertility 
of the season, the plenty of fish, &c., &c., &c., in Bos 
ton and about it. I am condemned to this place, a 
miserable exile from every thing that is agreeable to 
me. God will my banishment shall not last long. 



LETTER CXXVII. 

Philadelphia, 11 August, 1777. 

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 

I THINK I have sometimes observed to you in conver 
sation, that upon examining the biography of illustri 
ous men, you will generally find some female about

242 LETTEES. 

them, in the relation of mother, or wife, or sister, to 
whose instigation a great part of their merit is to be 
ascribed. You will find a curious example of this in 
the case of Aspasia, the wife of Pericles. She was a 
woman of the greatest beauty and the first genius. 
She taught him, it is said, his refined maxims of poli 
cy, his lofty imperial eloquence, nay, even composed 
the speeches on which so great a share of his reputa 
tion was founded. The best men in Athens frequent 
ed her house and brought their wives to receive les 
sons from her of economy and right deportment. 
Socrates himself was her pupil in eloquence, and gives 
her the honor of that funeral oration, which he deliv 
ers in the Menexenus of Plato. Aristophanes, in 
deed, abuses this famous lady, but Socrates does her 
honor. 

I wish some of our great men had such wives. By 
the account in your last letter, it seems the women in 
Boston begin to think themselves able to serve their 
country. What a pity it is, that our generals in the 
northern districts had not Aspasias to their wives ! 

I believe the two Howes have not very great wo 
men for wives. If they had, we should suffer more 
from their exertions than we do. This is our good 
fortune. A woman of good sense would not let her 
husband spend five weeks at sea in such a season of

LETTER CXXV1II. 
Philadelphia, Tuesday, ID August, 1777. 

MY BEST FRIEND, 

YOUR obliging favor of the 5th 1 came by yesterday s 
post, and I intended to have answered it by this morn 
ing s post, but was delayed by many matters, until lie 
gave me the slip. 

I am sorry that you and the people of Boston were 
put to so much trouble, but glad to hear that such 
numbers determined to fly. The prices for carting 
which were demanded were detestable. I wish your 
fatigue and anxiety may not have injured your health. 
Don t be anxious for my safety. If Howe comes 
here, I shall run away, I suppose, with the rest. We 
arc too brittle ware, you know, to stand the dashing of 
balls and bombs. I wonder upon what principle the 
Roman senators refused to lly from the Gauls, and 
determined to sit with their ivory staves and hoary 
beards, in the porticoes of their houses, until the ene 
my entered the city and, although they confessed they 
resembled the gods, put them to the sword. 1 should 
not choose to indulge this sort of dignity ; but 1 con 
fess I feel myself so much injured by these barbarian 
Britons, that I have a strong inclination to meet them 
in the field. This is not revenge, I believe, but there 
is something sweet and delicious in the contemplation

of it There is in our hearts an indignation against 
wrong that is righteous and benevolent ; and he who 
is destitute of it, is defective in the balance of his af 
fections and in his moral character. 

As long as there is conscience in our breasts, a 
moral sense which distinguishes between right and 
wrong, approving, esteeming, loving the former, and 
undermining and detesting the other, we must feel a 
pleasure in the punishment of so eminent a contemner 
of all that is right, and good, and just, as Howe is. 
They are virtuous and pious passions that prompt us 
to desire his destruction, and to lament and deplore 
his success and prosperity. The desire of assisting 
towards his disgrace is an honest wish. 

It is too late in life, my constitution is too much de 
bilitated by speculation, and indeed, it is too late a pe 
riod in the war, for me to think of girding on a sword. 
But if I had the last four years to run over again, I 
certainly would. 



LETTER CillX. 
Philadelphia, Tuesday, 19 August, 1777. 

MY BEST FBJESD, 

THE weather still continues cloudy and cool, and the 
wind easterly. Howe s fleet and army is still incog 
nito. The gentlemen from South Carolina begin to 
tremble for Charleston. If Howe is under a judi- 



LETTERS. 245 

cial blindness, he may be gone there. But what will 
be the fate of a scorbutic army, cooped up in a fleet for 
six, seven, or eight weeks, in such intemperate weath 
er as we have had ? What, will be their condition, 
landing on a burning shore abounding with agues and 
musquetoes, in the most unwholesome season of the 
whole year ? If he should get Charleston, or indeed 
the whole State, what progress will this make towards 
the conquest of America ? lie will stop the trade of 
rice and indigo, but what then ? Besides, he will get 
some ugly knocks. They are honest, sincere, and 
brave, and will make his life uncomfortable. 

I feel a strong affection for South Carolina for sev 
eral reasons. 1. I think them as stanch patriots as 
any in America. 2. I think them as brave. 3. They 
arc the only people in America, who have maintained 
a post and defended a fort. 4. They have sent us a 
new delegate whom I greatly admire, Mr. Lnurcns, 
their Lieutenant Governor, a gentleman of great for 
tune, great abilities, modesty and integrity, and great 
experience too. If all the States would send us such 
men, it would be a pleasure to be here. 

In the northern department they begin to fight. 
The family of Johnson, the black part of it as well as 
the white are pretty well thinned. Rascals ! They 
deserve extermination. I presume Gates will be so 
supported that Burgoyne will be obliged to retreat. 
Ho will stop at Ticonderoga, I suppose, for they can 
maintain posts although we cannot. I think we shall 
never defend a post until we shoot a general. After 
that we shall defend posts, and this event in my opin- 



246 LBTTEE8. 

ion is not far off. No other fort will ever be evacua 
ted without an inquiry, nor any officer come off with 
out a court martial. We must trifle no more. We 
have suffered too many disgraces to pass unexpiated. 
Every disgrace must be wiped off. 

We have been several days hammering upon mo 
ney. We are contriving every way we can to re 
dress the evils we feel and fear from loo great a quan 
tity of paper. Taxation as deep as possible is the 
only radical cure. I hope you will pay every tax that 
is brought you, if you sell my books, or clothes, or 
oxen, or your cows to pay it 



LETTER CXXX. 
Philadelphia., Wednesday, 20 August, 1777. 

MY BEST FR1ESD, 

THIS day completes three years since I stepped into 
the coach at Mr. Cushing s door, in Boston, to go to 
Philadelphia in quest of adventures. And adventures 
I have found. I feel an inclination sometimes to write 
the history of the last three years, in imitation of 
Thucydides. There is a striking resemblance in sev 
eral particulars between the Peloponnesian and the 
American war. The real motive to the former was a 
jealousy of the growing power of Athens by sea and 
land. The genuine motive to the latter was a similar 



LETTERS. 247 

jealousy of the growing power of America. The true 
causes which incite to war are seldom professed or 
acknowledged. 

We are now upon a full sea : when we shall arrive ) 
at a safe harbor, no mariner has skill and experience 
enough to foretell. But by the favor of Heaven, we 
shall make a prosperous voyage, after all the storms I 
and shoals arc passed. 



5 o clock. Afternoon. 

It is now fair sunshine again and very warm. Not 
a word yet from Howe s fleet. The most general 
suspicion now is, that it is gone to Charleston, Soulh 
Carolina. But it is a wild supposition. It may be 
right however, for he is a wild General. 

We have been hammering to-day upon a mode of 
trial for the general officers at Ti. Whether an in 
quiry will precede the court martial, and whether the 
inquiry shall be made by a committee of Congress, or 
by a council of general officers, is not determined, but 
inquiry and trial both, I conjecture there will be. 

If Howe is gone to Charleston, you will have a lit 
tle quiet, and enjoy your corn, and rye, and flax, and 
hay, and other good things, until another summer. 
But what shall we do for sugar and wine and rum ? 
Why truly, I believe we must leave them ofT. Loaf 
sugar is only four dollars a pound here, and brown 
only a dollar for the meanest sort, and ten shil 
lings for that a little belter. Every body here is leav- 



248 LETTERS. 

ing off loaf sugar, and most are laying aside brown. 
As to rum and wine, give me cider and I would com 
pound. New England rum is but forty shillings a 
gallon. But if wine was ten dollars a bottle I would 
have one glass a day in water while the hot weather 
continues, unless I could get cider. 



LETTER CXXXI. 
Philadelphia, Thursday, 21 Augu.t, 1777. 

MY BEST FRIKKD, 

THIS morning we have heard again from the fleet 
At nine o clock at night on the fourteenth instant, up 
wards of a hundred sail were seen standing in be 
tween the capes of Chesapeake bay. They had been 
seen from the eastern shore of Virginia, standing off 
and on, for two days before. This method of coast 
ing along the shore, and standing off and on, is very 
curious. First, seen off Egg harbor, then several 
times, off the capes of Delaware, standing in and out, 
then off Sinnepuxent, then off the eastern shore of 
Virginia, then standing in to Chesapeake bay. How 
many men and horses will he lose in this sea ramble, 
in the heat of dog days ? Whether he is going to Vir 
ginia to steal tobacco, to North Carolina to pilfer pitch 
and tar, or to South Carolina to plunder rice and indigo, 
who can tell ? He will seduce a few negroes from 



LETTERS. 249 

their masters, let him go to which he will. But is 
this conquering America ? 

From the northward we learn that Arnold has 
marched with about two thousand men to the relief of 
fort Schuyler. Our people have given Sir John John 
son and his regulars, Tories and Indians, a very fine 
drubbing. The Indians scarcely ever had such a 
mauling. The devils are so frightened that they are 
all run away to howl and mourn. The papers en 
closed with this will give you more particular infor 
mation. Can nothing be done at Rhode Island at this 
critical time? Opprobrium Novanglice ! What is 
become of all the Massachusetts continental troops ? 
Every regiment and every man of them is at the 
northward under Gates, and yet we are told they have 
not four thousand men fit for duty, officers included. 
And there are three regiments there from New Hamp 
shire too. 



10 o clock at night. 

Just come in from Congress. We have within this 
hour received letters of General Schuyler and Lincoln, 
giving an account of the battle of Bennington, where 
in General Stark has acquired great glory, and so have 
his militia. The particulars are to be out in a hand 
bill to-morrow morning. I will enclose you one.

BEST 



IT 13 now no longer a secret where Mr. Howe s fleet 
is. We have authentic intelligence that it is arrived 
at the head of Chesapeake bay, above the river Pa- 
tapsco, upon which the town of Baltimore stands. I 
wish I could describe to you the geography of this 
country, so as to give you an adequate idea of the sit 
uation of the two great bays of Chesapeake and Del 
aware, because it would enable you to form a con 
jecture concerning the object he aims at The dis 
tance across land from the heads of these bays is but 
small, and forms an isthmus, below which is a large 
peninsula, comprehending the counties of Accomac 
and Northampton in Virginia, the counties of Somer 
set and Worcester in Maryland, and the counties of 
Kent and Sussex in Delaware. His march by land to 
Philadelphia may be about sixty or seventy miles. 
I think there can be no doubt that he aims at this 
place, and he has taken this voyage of six weeks, long 
enough to have gone to London, merely to avoid an 
army in his rear. He found he could not march 
this way from Somerset court house without leaving 
General Washington in his rear. We have called out 
the militia of Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and Penn 
sylvania, to oppose him, and General Washington is

handy enough to meet him ; and as General Wash 
ington saved Philadelphia last winter by crossing the 
Delaware and marching to Morristown, and so getting 
in the rear of Howe, so, I conjecture, he will still find 
means to get in his rear between him and Chesapeake 
bay. You may now sit under your own vine and 
have none to make you afraid. I sent ofT my man 
and horse at an unlucky time, but if we should be 
obliged to remove from hence, we shall not go far. 

If Congress had deliberated and debated a month, 
they could not have concerted a plan for Mr. Howe 
more to our advantage, than that which he has adopt 
ed. He gives us an opportunity of exerting the 
strength of all the middle States against him, while 
New York and New England are destroying Bur- 
goyne. Now is the time ! never was so good an op 
portunity for my countrymen to turn out and crush 
that vaporing, blustering bully to atoms. 



LETTER CXXXI1I. 
Philadelphia, Saturday, 23 August, 1777, 4 o clock. 

MY BEST FRIEND, 

WE have an express to-day from Governor Johnson, 
Captain Nicholson and several other gentlemen, with 
an account that the fleet, to the number of two hun 
dred and sixty -three sail, have gone up towards the 



252 LETTERS. 

head of Chesapeake bay. They lie over against the 
shore between the river Sassafras and the river Elk. 
We have also a letter from General Washington ac 
quainting us, that to-morrow morning at seven o clock, 
he shall march his army through the city of Philadel 
phia, along Front street, and then turn up Chestnut 
street in his way to cross over the bridge at Schuylkill 
river; so that General Howe will have a grand con 
tinental army to oppose him, in very good season, 
aided by a formidable collection of militia. I like 
this movement of the General through the city. Such 
a show of artillery, waggons, light horse and infantry, 
which takes up a line of nine or ten miles upon their 
march, and will not be less than five or six hours pass 
ing through the town, will make a good impression 
upon the minds of the timorous whigs for their con 
firmation ; upon the cunning Quakers for their re 
straint ; and upon the rascally Tories for their confu 
sion. 

I think there is a reasonable ground for confidence, 
with the favor of Heaven, that Howe will not be able to 
reach this city. Yet I really doubt whether it would 
not be more for our interest that he should come here, 
and get possession of the town. 

1. Because there are impurities here which will 
never be so soon or so fully purged away, as by that 
fire of affliction which Howe enkindles wherever he 
goes. 

2. Because it would employ nearly the whole of 
his force to keep possession of this town, and the rest 
of the continent would be more at liberty. 



LETTERS. 253 

3. We could counteract him here, better than in 
many other places. 

4. He would leave New England and New York 
at leisure to kill or catch Burgoyne. 

In all events you may rejoice and sing, for the sea 
son is so far gone that he cannot remove to you.

LETTER CXXXIV. 

Philadelphia, 24 August, 1 



WE had, last evening, a thunder gust very sharp and 
violent, attended with a plentiful rain. The lightning 
struck in several places. It struck the Quaker alms- 
house in Walnut street, between Third and Fourth 
streets, not far from Captain Duncan s, where I lodge. 
They had been wise enough to place an iron rod upon 
the top of the steeple, for a vane to turn on, and had 
provided no conductor to the ground. It also struck 
in Fourth street, near Mrs. Checsman s. No person 
was hurt. 

This morning was fair, but now it is overcast and 
rains very hard, which will spoil our show, and wet the 
army. 

]2 o clock. 

The rain ceased, and the army marched through 
the town between seven and ten o clock. The wag- 



254 LETTERS. 

gons went another road. Four regiments of light 
horse, Bland s, Baylor s, Sheldon s and Moylan s. 
Four grand divisions of the army, and the artillery 
with the matrosses. They marched twelve deep, and 
yet took up above two hours in passing by. General 
Washington and the other general officers with their 
aids on horseback. The Colonels and other field offi 
cers on horseback. We have now an army well 
appointed between us and Mr. Howe, and this army 
will be immediately joined by ten thousand militia, so 
that I feel as secure here as if I was at Braintree, but 
not so happy. My happiness is nowhere to be found 
but there. 

After viewing this fine spectacle and firm defence, 
I went to Mr. Duffield s meeting to hear him pray, as 
he did most fervently, and I believe he was most sin 
cerely joined by all present, for its success. 

The army, upon an accurate inspection of it, I find 
to be extremely well armed, pretty well clothed and 
tolerably disciplined. Gill and Town, by the motto 
to their newspapers, will bring discipline into vogue in 
time. There is such a mixture of the sublime and 
the beautiful together with the useful in military disci 
pline, that I wonder every officer we have is not 
charmed with it Much remains yet to be done. Our 
soldiers have not yet quite the air of soldiers. They 
don t step exactly in time. They don t hold up their 
heads quite erect, nor turn out their toes so exactly 
as they ought. They don t all of them cock their 
hats, and such as do, don t all wear them the same 
way. 



LETTERS. 255 

A disciplinarian has affixed to him commonly tho 
ideas of cruelty, severity, tyranny, &c. But if I were 
an officer, I am convinced I should be the most deci 
sive disciplinarian in the army. I am convinced there 
is no other cHeclivc way of indulging benevolence, 
humanity, and the tender social passions in an army. 
There is no other way of preserving the health and 
spirits of the men. There is no other way of making 
them active and skilful in war ; no other way of 
guarding an army against destruction by surprises, 
and no other method of giving them confidence in one 
another, or making them stand by one another in tho 
hour of battle. Discipline in an army is like the laws 
in civil society. There can be no liberty in a com 
monwealth where the laws are not revered, and most 
sacredly observed, nor can there be happiness or safe 
ty in an army for a single hour where the discipline 
is not observed. 

Obedience is the only thing wanting now for our 
salvation. Obedience to the laws in the States, and 
obedience to officers in the army.

Philadelphia, Tuesday, 20 August, 1777. 

MV BEST FRIEND, 

HOWE S army, at least about five thousand of them, 
besides his light horse, arc landed upon the banks of 
the Elk river, and the disposition he has made of his 
forces indicates a design to rest and refresh both men 
and horses. General Washington was at Wilmington 
last night, and his army is there to-day. The militia 
arc turning out with great alacrity both in Maryland 
and Pennsylvania. They arc distressed for want of 
arms. Many have none, others have only little fowl 
ing pieces. However, we shall rake and scrape 
enough to do Howe s business, by the favor of 
Heaven. 

Howe must have intended that Washington should 
have sent his army up to fight Burgoyne. But he is 
disappointed. The kindness of Heaven towards us 
lias in nothing appeared more conspicuous, than in 
this motion of Howe. If the infatuation is not so 
universal as to seize Americans as well as him, it will 
prove the certain destruction of Burgoyne s army. 
The New England troops and New York troops are 
every man of them at Peekskill and with Gates. 
The Massachusetts men are all with Gates. General 
Washington has none but southern troops with him, 
and he has much the largest army to encounter. 

If my countrymen do not now turn out and do

something, I shall be disappointed indeed. One fifth 
part of Burgoyne s army has been totally destroyed 
by Stark and Herkimer. The remainder must be 
shocked and terrified at the stroke. Now is the time 
to strike. New England men ! strike home. 



LETTER CXXXV1I. 
Philadelphia, Friday, 29 August, 1777. 

MY DEAREST FRIL.ND, 

THE newspapers enclosed will give you all the intelli 
gence of any consequence. General Washington, with 
a very numerous army, is between Wilmington and 
the Head of Elk. Howe will make but a pitiful figure. 
The militia of four States are turning out with much 
alacrity and cheerful spirits. The continental army 
under Washington, Sullivan and Nash, besides, is in 
my opinion more numerous by several thousands than 
Howe s whole force. I am afraid that he will be 
frightened, and run on board his ships, and go away 
plundering to some other place. I almost wish he had 
Philadelphia, for then he could not get away. I really 
think it would be the best policy to retreat before 
him, and let him into this snare, where his army must 
be ruined. However, this policy will not be adopted. 
In a letter from good authority, Mr. Paca, we are 
informed that many dead horses have been driven on 



LETTERS. 259 

/ 

the eastern shore of Maryland. Horses thrown over 
board from the fleet no doubt. 

Prices current. Four pounds a week for board, 
besides finding your own washing, shaving, candles, 
liquors, pipes, tobacco, wood, &c. Thirty shillings a 
week for a servant. It ought to be thirty shillings for 
a gentleman and four pounds for the servant, because 
he generally eats twice as much, and makes twice as 
much trouble. Shoes, five dollars a pair. Salt, 
twenty-seven dollars a bushel. Butter, ten shillings 
a pound. Punch, twenty shillings a bowl. All the 
old women and young children arc gone down to the 
Jersey shore to make salt. Salt water is boiling all 
round the coast, and I hope it will increase. For it is 
nothing but hcedlcssncss and shiftlessness that pre 
vents us from making salt enough for a supply. But 
necessity will bring us to it. As to sugar, molasses, 
rum, &c., we must leave them off. Whiskey is used 
here instead of rum, and I don t see but it is just as 
good. Of this, the wheat and rye countries can easily 
distil enough for the use of the country. If I cotrW-gefc 
cider I would be content. 

The business of the country has been in so critical 
and dangerous a situation for the last twelve months, 
that it was necessary the Massachusetts should have a 
full representation, but the expenses of living are 
grown so enormous that I believe it will be necessary 
to reduce the number of Delegates to three, after the 
campaign is over.

LETTER CXITVIII. 
Philadelphia, Saturday, 30 August, 1777. 



MT FH1E5D, 



A LETTER from General Washington was received 
last night by the President, which I read. It is dated 
the 29th; yesterday. 

The enemy are in possession of the Head of Elk, 
a little town at the head of the river Elk, in which 
they found a quantity of corn and oats belonging to 
the States. Waggons were so universally taken up 
in conveying away the valuable effects cf the inhabit 
ants, that none could be procured to transport this 
grain. Part of their army has advanced to Gray s 
hill, about two miles from the Head cf Elk, but whether 
to take post there, or only to cover while they remove 
their plunder from the Head of Elk, is uncertain. 

Our army is at Wilmington. We have many offi 
cers out reconnoitring the country and the enemy. 
Our scouting parties have taken between thirty and 
forty prisoners, and twelve deserters are come in from 
the fleet, and eight from the army. They say the 
men are generally healthy, but their horses have suf 
fered much from the voyage. These prisoners and 
deserters are unable to give any other intelligence. 
The enemy give out that they are eighteen thousand 
strong. But these are like Burgoyne s, " make be 
lieves " and " insinuations." We know better ; and 



LETTERS. 261 

that they have not ten thousand. The militia from 
four Slates are joining General Washington in large 
numbers. The plan of their military operations this 
campaign is well calculated for our advantage. I 
hope we shall have heads and hearts to improve it. 

For my own part I feel a secret wish that they 
might get into this city, because I think it more for 
our interest that they should be cooped up here, than 
that they should run away again to New York. But 
according to present appearances they will not be able 
to get here. By going into the Chesapeake bay, they 
have betrayed a dread of the fire works in the river 
Delaware, which indeed are formidable. They must 
make the most of their time, for they cannot ration 
ally depend upon so fine a season late in the fall and 
early in winter as ttjey had the last year. Septem 
ber, October and November are all that remain. 

We expect hourly, advices from Gates and Arnold. 
Wo have rumors of an expedition to Long Island un 
der Parsons, and another to Staten Island under Sulli 
van, but no regular accounts. I suppose it certain 
that such expeditions have been made, but know not 
the success.

LETTER 
Philadelphia, Monday, 1 September, 1777. 

MT DEAB, 

WE have now run through the summer, and although 
the weather is still warm, the fiercest of the heat is 
over. And although the extreme intemperance of 
the late season hat weakened and exhaustc .t .rr ich, 
yet I think, upon the whole, 1 have got through it as 
well as upon any former occasion. 

A letter from General Washington, dated Saturday, 
informs that our light parties have brought in four-and- 
twenty prisoners more. So that the prisoners and de 
serters since Mr. Howe landec 1 are near a hundred. 
The question now is, whether there will be a general 
engagement ? In the first place, I think, after all that 
has passed, it is not good policy for us to attack them, 
unless we can get a favorable advantage of them in 
the situation of the ground, or an opportunity to at 
tack a detachment of their army with superior num 
bers. It would be imprudent, perhaps, for us with our 
whole force to attack them with all theirs. 

But another question arises, whether Mr. Howe will 
not be able to compel us to a general engagement ? 
Perhaps he may ; but I make a question of it. Wash 
ington will manoeuvre it with him a good deal to avoid 
it A general engagement, in which Howe should be 
defeated, would be ruin to him. If we should be de- 



LETTERS.

fcated, his army would be crippled, and perhaps we 
might suddenly reinforce our army, which he could 
not. However, all that he could gain by a victory- 
would be the possession of this town, which would be 
the worst situation lie could be in, because it would em 
ploy his whole force by sea and land to keep it and 
the command of the river. 

Their principal dependence is not upon their arms, 
I believe, so much as upon the failure of our revenue. 
Tb jy bink they have taken such measures, by circu 
lating ccunteifc : t bills, to depreciate the currency, 
that it cannot hold its credit longer tlian this cam 
paign. But they are mU aken 

We, however, must disappoint them by renouncing 
all luxuries, and by a severe economy. General 
Washington sets a fine example. He has banished 
wine from his table, and entertains his friends with 
rum and water. This is much to the honor of his 
wisdom, his policy, and his patriotism. And the ex 
ample must be followed by banishing sugar and all 
imported articles from our families. If necessity 
should reduce us to a simplicity of dress and diet be 
coming republicans, it would be a happy and a glori 
ous necessity. 

Yours, yours, yours.

LETTEK CXL. 
Philadelphia, Tuesday, 2 September, 1777. 

MY DEAR FRlCtD, 

I HAD, yesterday, the pleasure of yours of , from 

Boston, and am happy to find that you have been able 
to do so well amidst all your difficulties. There is 
but one course for us to take, and that is to renounce 
the use of all foreign commodities. For my own 
part, I never lived in my whole life so meanly and 
poorly as 1 do now, and yet my constituents will growl 
at my extravagance. Happy should I be indeed, if I 
could share with you in the produce of your little 
farm. Milk, and apples, and pork, and beef, and the 
fruits of the garden would be luxury to me. 

We had nothing yesterday from the General. 
Howe s army are in a very unwholesome situation. 
Their water is very bad and brackish. There are fre 
quent morning and evening fogs, which produce in 
termittent fevers in abundance. Washington has a 
great body of militia assembled and assembling, in ad- 
dition to a grand continental army. Whether he will 
strike or not, I can t say. He is very prudent, you 
know, and will not unnecessarily hazard his army. 
By my own inward feelings, I judge, I should put 
more to risk if I were in his shoes, but perhaps he is 
right. Gansevoort has proved that it is possible to 
hold a post. Herkimer has shown that it is possible 



LETTERS. 265 

to fight Indians, and Stark has proved that it is prac 
ticable even to attack lines and posts with militia. I 
wish the continental army would prove tlmt any thing 
can be done. But this is sedition at least. I am 
weary, however, I own, with so much insipidity. 

St. Leger and his party have run away. So will 
Burgoyne. I wish Stark had the supreme command 
in the northern department. I am sick of Fabian 
systems in all quarters. The officers drink a longand 
moderate war. My toasl is, a short and violent war. 
They would call me mad and rash, &c., but I know 
better. I am as cool as any of them, and cooler too, 
for my mind is not inflamed with fear nor anger, 
whereas, I believe theirs are with both. If this letter 
should be intercepted and published, it would do as 
much good as another did two years ago. 

Adieu.

INTERCEPTED LETTTERS. p. 57. 



Two private and confidential letters written by John 
Adams, in the year 1775, which were intercepted and pub 
lished by the British, are so frequently alluded to in this 
correspondence that it may not be unadvisable to give in 
this place some explanation of their history. The origin 
als were taken in crossing the ferry at Newport, were sent 
on board the fleet of Admiral Graves, from thence fell into 
the hands of General Gage, and were by him transmitted 
to the Government at home. They are now in the State 
Paper Office in London. Copies were procured by some 
friend of his for Mr. Adams, from which they are now- 
printed. The first of them was directed 

"To the Honorable James Warren, Esquire at Water- 
town, by Mr. Hichbourne." This gentleman was then 
President of the provincial Congress of Massachusetts. 
It is as follows :

Philadelphia, 24 July, 1775. 



DEAR SIR, 



I am determined to write freely to you this time. A 
certain great fortune and piddling genius, whose fame has 
been trumpeted so loudly, has given a silly cast to our 
whole doings. "We are between Hawk and Buzzard. 
We ought to have had in our hands, a month ago, the 
whole legislative, executive and judicial of the whole con 
tinent, and have completely modelled a constitution ; to 
have raised a naval power and opened all our ports wide; 
to have arrested every friend of government on the con 
tinent and held them as hostages for the poor victims in 
Boston, and then opened the door as wide as possible for 
peace and reconciliation. After this, they might have 
petitioned, negotiated, addressed, &c., if they would. Is 
all this extravagant? Is it wild ? Is it not the soundest 
policy ? Ooe piece of news, seven thousand pounds of 
powder arrived last night. We shall send you some of it 
as soon as we can, but you must be patient and frugal. 
We are lost in the extensiveness of our field of business. 
We have a continental treasury to establish, a paymaster 
to choose, and a committee of correspondence, or safety, 
or accounts, or something, I know not what, that has con 
founded us all this day. 

Shall I hail you Speaker of the House, or councillor or 
what ? What kind of an election had you ? What sort 
of magistrates do you intend to make ? Will your new 
legislative or executive feel bold or irresolute ? Will your 
judicial hang, and whip, and fine, and imprison without 
scruple ? I want to see our distressed country once more, 
yet I dread the sight of devastation. You observe in 
your letter the oddity of a great man. He is a queer 



APPENDIX. 269 

creature, but you must love his dogs if you love him, and 
forgive a thousand whims for the sake of the soldier and 
the scholar. 

Yours. 

The other letter was directed " To Mrs. Abigail Adams, 
at Braintree, to the care of Colonel Warren, by Mr. Hich- 
bourne," and runs as follows : 



It is now almost three months since I left you, in every 
part of which, my anxiety about you and the children, as 
well as our country, has been extreme. The business I 
have had upon my mind has been as great and important 
as can be entrusted to man, and the difficulty and intrica 
cy of it prodigious. When fifty or sixty men have a con 
stitution to form for a great empire, at the same time that 
they have a country of fifteen hundred miles extent to for 
tify, millions to arm and train, a naval power to begin, 
an extensive commerce to regulate, numerous tribes of 
Indians to negotiate with, a standing army of twenty-seven 
thousand men to raise, pay, victual and officer, I really 
shall pity those fifty or sixty men. I must see you ere 
long. Rice has written me a very good letter. So has 
Thaxter, for which I thank them both. Love to the 
children. 

J.A. 



P. S. I wish I had given you a complete history, from 
the beginning to the end of the journey, of the behu/iorof 
my compatriots. No mortal tale can equal it. I will tell 
you in future, but you shall keep it secret. The fidgets, 
the whims, the caprice, the vanity, the superstition, the 

irritability of some of us is enough to . 

Yours. 



270 APPENDIX. 

It frequently happens that papers excite public atten 
tion in a most extraordinary decree, not simply from the 
matter which they contain, but also from the precise mo 
ment at which they make their appearance. Had these 
letters been made public one year after the time they 
were taken, so familiar had the sentiments which they 
express then become, that they would have excited little 
notice. As it was, there is abundant evidence, without 
resorting to the present collection, of the great effect 
which they produced, both in Great Britain and America. 
The second petition to the King had been drawn up and 
carried through Congress by Mr. John Dickinson, against 
all t.tie efforts which Mr. Adams could make in opposi 
tion, two wee ks before the date of these letters. He was 
" the great fortune and piddling genius," who is alluded 
to at the commencement of the first one. This endeavor to 
procure the adoption of a second measure of conciliation, 
after the failure of the first, was regarded by Mr. Ada ins as a 
backward step in the course of events thai was impelling the 
country to assume independence of Great Britain, and was 
for that reason most strenuously but unavailingly resisted by 
him. His mind, which had always been in advance of pub 
lic sentiment, was rapidly maturing all the organization 
that was necessarily to follow the Declaration, long be 
fore those of his fellow citizens generally had become pre 
pared even to take that step itself. The details of this or 
ganization are sketched in these two letters, and constitute 
all thai is remarkable about them. Neither the ministry 
at home nor the public mind out of New England had 
been at all prepared beforehand to receive them. The 
consequence was, that Mr. Adams was by their publica 
tion placed in an extremely diQicult and exposed situation. 
Governor Gage enclosed them in a letter to Lord Dart 
mouth, and most erroneously endeavored to prove from 
them the existence of a scheme of rebellion preconcerted 



APPENDIX. 271 

years before in Massachusetts. 1 The ministry proba 
bly received them at about the same time with the se 
cond petition to the King, and very naturally inferred from 
them a want of sincerity on the part of the Congress 
which was not founded in justice. For in fact there had 
been an opposition of opinion in that body, in which the 
minority had yielded without being convinced, and Mr. 
Adams only represented that minority. 

In the letter of Mrs. Adams of the 2 10 March, 1776, 
she mentions a cousin who "writes from England that 
these letters have made much noise there," and laments 
that Mr. Adams ever wrote them. This was the natural 
course of a person of limited views surrounded by Eng 
lishmen friendly to America, and still clinging to the 
hope of reconciliation. Mr. Adams must have appeared 
to such men as exposing himself to just censure, although 
he was only marking out, in broad lines, the foundations for 
a system of government which, he foresaw though they 
could not, must be a necessary consequence of the meas 
ures originated and persevered in by the mother country 
itself; measures, which he did not suppose would ever 
be abandoned, however others might ( alter themselves 
that they would. It was the proof first presented to the 
eyes of the British, in these letters, that the remonstrants 
were fully capable of a sustained policy, and that the re 
sistance to them was something more than momentary 
impulse, which gave to them such importance in their 
eyes. The general tone of the English, particularly of 
the regular army, towards the colonists, had always been 
one of sovereign contempt. Hence the mode in which 
these letters were received by the garrison in Boston, was 
that of ridicule. The importance attached by Mr. Ad- 

1 "The Writings of Washington," edited by Mr. Jarcd 
Sparks, Vol. ii. 491), Vol. iii. 514. 



272 APPENDIX. 

ams to the measures of the Congress, was regarded 
as ludicrously self-sufficient and absurd. The officers 
amused themselves in making paraphrases. One of 
these is referred to in Mrs. Adams s letter of the 22d of 
October of this year, in which she says that they inserted 
as much of scurrility against the author as they could 
frame out of the details of his life. 

But all this, however much of relaxation it may hare 
afforded to idlers in the British ranks, was productive of no 
inconvenience whatever to Mr. Adams himself. The same 
thing cannot be said of the effect which the publication of 
the letters had upon him when they reached Philadelphia. 
They contained indirect censure of a majority of the Con 
gress who had chosen to follow Mr. Dickinson s lead, as 
well as a reflection upon that gentleman himself, and 
upon the humors of some of his own colleagues. They 
also contained a notice not altogether complimentary of 
General Charles Lee. The persons thus commented upon 
were probably not unwilling to give vent to their private 
griefs by falling into the current of indignation which im 
mediately set against Mr. Adams s doctrines upon pub 
lic affairs. The consequence was, that he fell under a 
sentence of almost total excommunication. Many of 
his subsequent letters throughout this volume, contain 
allusions to the consequences of this event to him, and it 
appears to have made him for a long time more cautious 
in expressing himself. In a character of Mr. Adams, 
drawn by Dr. Benjamin Rush, and now in manuscript in 
the hands of the Editor of these letters, it is stated that 
these letters " exposed him to the execrations of all the 
prudent and moderate people in America, insomuch that 
he was treated with neglect by many of his old friends." 
"I saw,* he proceeds, "this gentleman walk the streets of 
Philadelphia, alone, after the publication of his intercepted 
letter in our newspapers in 1775, an object of nearly uni- 



APPENDIX. 27U 

versal scorn and detestation. Events soon justified the 
wish contained in his letter, after which he rose in the 
public estimation so as to become in the subsequent years 
of the revolution, in some measure the oracle of the 
Whigs." The lapse of little more than twelve months 
found Mr. Adams and Mr. Dickinson in a position com 
pletely reversed, the latter gentleman complaining of a 
desertion much the same in character with that which had 
happened to the former. Such, it may be remarked, is 
the N usual fate of men engaged in contests with each 
other upon great public questions, where the indiscreet 
sagacity of one party runs almost as far in advance of the 
popular opinion as the prudent timidity of the other 
keep it following in the rear.

THOUGHTS ON GOVERNMENT. 

The following memorandum was found among the 
papers of Mr. Adams, written upon a single leaf which 
appears once to have preceded a copy of the letter to 
George Wythe. 

In the winter of 1776 there was much discussion in 
Congress concerning the necessity of independence, and 
advising the several States to institute governments for 
themselves under the immediate authority and original 
power of the people. Great difficulties occurred to many 
gentlemen in making a transition from the old govern* 
meats to new, i. e., from the royal to republican govern- 

VOL. in. 18 



271 APPEXDLI. 

ments. In January, 1776. Mr. George Wythe of Virginia, 
passing an evening with me, asked what plan I would ad* 
vise a colony to pursue, in order to get out of the old gov 
ernment and into a new one. I sketched in words a 
scheme, which he requested me to give him in writing. 
Accordingly, the next day, I delivered to him the follow 
ing letter. He lent it to his colleague, Richard Henry 
Lee, who asked me to let him print it ; to which I consent 
ed, provided he would suppress my name; for if that 
should appear, it would excite a continental clamor 
among the Tories, that I was erecting a battering ram to 
demolish the royal government and render independence 
indispensable. 

QUIXCY, 21 July, 1811. 

The copy of the letter to which this notice was pre 
fixed, is now separated from it, and neither that nor any 
other has been discovered among the papers. Judge 
Cranch, when preparing his Memoir of Mr. Adams for 
the Columbian Institute at Wash ington, was unable to find 
it in print, notwithstanding that it has been several times 
published; once anonymously by Dunlap in Philadelphia, 
at the lime it was written ; once by Thomas in the Massa 
chusetts Spy, by whom it was attributed to Mr. Jefferson; 
and once more with the author s name, that of the per 
son to whom it was addressed, and with the preced 
ing preface. It is now taken from the Appendix to the 
Memoir of John Adams in the" Biography of the Signers 
to the Declaration of Independence," published by San 
derson, in Philadelphia. Another letter is to be found in 
a volume entitled " An inquiry into the principles and 
policy of the government of the United States, by John 
Taylor of Caroline county, Virginia," so closely resem 
bling it in language and substance, that it was considered 
by Mr. Taylor at the time to be the same. But the pub* 



APPENDIX. 



275 



lication elicited from Mr. Adams, in a private letter to 
him, an explanation, which, as connected with the history 
of the period, although perhaps, at the hazard of a little 
repetition, is here subjoined. 

"I suspect, by some accident or other, you linve con 
founded together a little printed pamphlet with a letter 
that was never printed. Let me give you an unvarnished 
explanation according to my best recollection. In Janu 
ary, 1770, six months before the Declaration of Indepen 
dence, Mr. Wythe, of Virginia, passed an evening with 
me at my chamber. In the course of conversation upon 
the necessity of independence, Mr. Wythe observing that 
the greatest obstacle in the way of a declaration of it was 
the difficulty of agreeing upon a government for our fu 
ture regulation ; I replied, that each colony should form 
a government for itself, as a free and independent state. 
" Well," said Mr. Wythe, " what plan would you institute 
or advise for any one of the Stales?" My answer was, 
" It is a thing I have not thought much of, but I will give 
you the first ideas that occur to me ;" and I went on to ex 
plain to him, oflf hand and in short hand, my first thoughts. 
Mr. Wythe appeared to think more of them than I did, 
and requested me to put down in writing what I had then 
said. I agreed, and accordingly that night and the next 
morning, wrote it and sent it in a letter to him. This 
letter he sent to R. H. Lee, who came and asked my leave 
to print it. I said it was not fit to be printed, nor worth 
printing, but if he thought otherwise, he might, provided 
he would suppress my name. He went accordingly to 
Dunlap and had it printed under the title of " Thoughts 
on government, in a letter from a gentleman to his 
friend." Thus much for the printed pamphlet. Now for 
the unprinted letter. Some time in the ensuing spring 
the delegates from North Carolina called upon me with 



} 






276 APPENDIX. 

a rote of the legislature of their State instructing them 
to apply to me for advice concerning a form of govern 
ment to be instituted in that State. I blushed, to be sore, 
to find that my name had reached so far as North Caro 
lina, and still more at such an unexpected honor from so 
respectable an assembly. Overwhelmed, however, as I 
was at that period, night and day, with business in Con 
gress and on committees, I found moments to write a 
letter, perhaps as long as that to Mr. Wythe, and con 
taining nearly the same outlines. In what points the two 
letters agree or differ I know not, for I kept no copy and 
have never seen it or heard of it since, till your volume 
revived the recollection of it." 



THOUGHTS ON GOVERNMENT, IN A LETTER FROM A GENTLE 
MAN TO HIS FRIEND. 

MY DEAR SIR, 

IF I was equal to the task of forming a plan for the gov 
ernment of a colony, I should be flattered with your re 
quest, and ve.-y happy to comply with it ; because as the 
divine science of politics is the science of social happi 
ness, and the blessings of society depend entirely on the 
constitutions of government, which are generally institu 
tions that last for many generations, there can be no em 
ployment more agreeable to a benevolent mind, than a 
research after the best. 

Pope flattered tyrants too much when he said, 

" For forms of government let fools contest, 
" That which is best administered is best" 

Nothing can be more fallacious than this: But poets read 
history to collect flowers, not fruits; they attend to fan- 



APPENDIX. 277 

ciful imnges, not the effects of social institutions. No 
thing is more certain from the history of nations, and na 
ture of man, than that some forms of government are bet 
ter fitted for being well administered than others. 

We ought to consider what is the end of government, 
before we determine which is the best form. Upon this 
point all speculative politicians will agree, that the hap 
piness of society is the end of government, as all divines 
and moral philosophers will agree that the happiness of 
the individual is the end of man. From this principle it 
will follow, that the form of government, which commu 
nicates ease, comfort, security, or in one word happiness, 
to the greatest number of persons, and in the greatest de 
gree, is the best. 

All sober inquirers after truth, ancient and modern, pa 
gan and Christian, have declared that the happiness of 
man, as well as his dignity, consists in virtue. , Confu 
cius, Zoroaster, Socrates, Mahomet, not to mention au 
thorities really sacred, have agreed in this. 

If there is a form of government then, whose principle 
and foundation is virtue, will not every sober man ac 
knowledge it better calculated to promote the general 
happiness than any other form ? 

Fear is the foundation of most governments ; but it is 
so sordid and brutal a passion, and renders men, in whose 
breasts it predominates, so stupid and miserable, that 
Americans will not be likely to approve of any political 
institution which is founded on it. 

Honor is truly sacred, but holds a lower rank in the 
scale of moral excellence than virtue. Indeed the former 
is but a part of the latter, and consequently has not equal 
pretensions to support a frame of government productive 
of human happiness. 

The foundation of every government is some principle 
or passion in the minds of the people. The noblest prin- 



278 APPENDIX. 

eiplea and most generous affections in oar nature then, 
hare the fairest chance to support the noblest and most 
generous models of government. 

A man must be indifferent to the sneers of modern 
Englishmen, to mention in (heir company, the names of 
Sidney, Harrington, Locke, Milton, Nedham, Neville, 
Burnet and Hoadley. No small fortitude is necessary to 
confess that one has read them. The wretched condition 
of this country, however, for ten or fifteen years past, has 
frequently reminded me of their principles and reason* 
ings. They will convince any candid mind, that there is 
no good government but what is republican. That the 
only VLluable part of the British constitution is so ; be* 
cause the very definition of a republic, is u an empire of 
laws, and not of men. n That, as a republic is the best 
of governments, so that particular arrangement of the 
powers of society, or in other words that form of govern 
ment, which is best contrived to secure an impartial and 
exact execution of the laws, is the best of republics. 

Of republics, there is an inexhaustible variety, because 
the possible combinations of the powers of society, are 
capable of innumerable variations. 

As good government, is an empire of laws, how shall 
your laws be made ? In a large society, inhabiting an ex 
tensive country, it is impossible that the whole should as 
semble to make laws. The first necessary step then, is, 
to depute power from the many, to a few of the most wise 
and good. But by what rules shall you choose your rep 
resentatives ? Agree upon the number and qualifications 
of persons, who shall have the benefit of choosing, or an 
nex this privilege to the inhabitants of a certain extent of 
ground. 

The principal difficulty lies, and the greatest care should 
be employed in constituting this representative assembly. 
It should be in miniature an exact portrait of the people 



APPENDIX. 279 

at large. It should think, feel, reason and act like them. 
That it may he the interest of tin s assembly to do strict 
justice at all times, it should be an equal representation, 
or in other words equal interest among the people should 
have equal interest in it. Great care should be taken to 
effect this, and to prevent unfair, partial, and corrupt 
elections. Such regulations, however, may be better 
made in trues of greater tranquillity than the present, and 
they will spring up themselves naturally, when all the 
powers of government come to be in the hands of the 
people s friends. At present it will be safest to proceed in 
all established modes, to which the people have been fa 
miliarized by habit. 

A representation of the people in one assembly being 
obtained, a question arises whether all the powers of gov 
ernment, legislative, executive, and judicial, shall be left 
in this body ? I think a people cannot be long free, nor 
ever happy, whose government is in one assembly. My 
reasons for this opinion are as follow : 

1. A single assembly is liable to all the vires, follies 
and frailties of an individual ; subject to fits of humor, 
starts of passion, (lights of enthusiasm, partialities or 
prejudice, and consequently productive of hasty results 
and absurd judgments. And all these errors ought to 
be corrected and defects supplied by some controlling 
power. 

2. A single assembly is apt to be avaricious, and in 
time will not scruple to exempt itself from burdens which 
it will lay, without compunction, on its constituents. 

3. A single assembly is apt to grow ambitious, and af 
ter a time will not hesitate to vote itself perpetual. This 
was one fault of the long parliament, but more remarkably 
of Holland, whose assembly first voted themselves from 
annual to septennial, then for life, and after a course of 
years, that all vacancies happening by death or otherwise 



280 APPENDIX. 

should be filled by themselves, without any application to 
constituents at all. 

4. A representative assembly, although extremely well 
qualified, and absolutely necessary as a branch of the leg 
islative, is unfit to exercise the executive power, for want 
of two essential properties, secrecy and despatch. 

5. A representative assembly is still less qualified for 
the judicial power; because it is too numerous, too slow, 
and too little skilled in the laws. 

6. Because a single assembly possessed of all the 
powers of government, would make arbitrary laws for 
their own interest, execute all laws arbitrarily for their 
own interest, and adjudge all controversies in their own 
favor. 

But shall the whole power of legislation rest in one as 
sembly ? Most of the foregoing reasons apply equally to 
prove that the legislative power ought to be more com 
plex to which we may add, that if the legislative power 
is wholly in one assembly, and the executive in another, 
or in a single person, these two powers will oppose and 
encroach upon each other, until the contest shall end in 
war, and the whole power, legislative and executive, be 
usurped by the strongest 

The judicial power, in such case, could not mediate, 
or hold the balance between the two contending powers, 
because the legislative would undermine it. And this 
shows the necessity too, of giving the executive power a 
negative upon the legislative, otherwise this will be con 
tinually encroaching upon that. 

To avoid these dangers let a distinct assembly be con 
stituted, as a mediator between the two extreme branches 
of the legislature, that which represents the people and 
that which is vested with the executive pow?r. 

Let the representative assembly then elect by ballot, 
from among themselves or their constituents, or both, a 



APPENDIX. 281 

distinct assembly, which for the sake of perspicuity we 
will call a council. It may consist of any number you 
please, say twenty or thirty, and should have a free and 
independent exercise of its judgment, and consequently a 
negative voice in the legislature. 

These two bodies thus constituted, and made integral 
parts of the legislature, let them unite, and by joint ballot 
choose a governor,who, after being stripped of most of those 
badges of domination called prerogatives, should have a 
free and independent exercise of his judgment, and be 
made also an integral part of the legislature. This I 
know is liable to objections, and if you please you may 
make him only president of the council, as in Connecti 
cut : But as the governor is to be invested with the ex 
ecutive power, with consent of council, I think he ought 
to have a negative upon the legislative. If he is annually 
elective, as he ought to be, he will always have so much 
reverence and affection for the people, their representatives 
and councillors, that although you give him an indepen 
dent exercise of his judgment, he will seldom use it in op 
position to the two houses, except in cases the public 
utility of which would be conspicuous ; and some such ca 
ses would happen. 

In the present exigency of American aflairs, when by 
an act of parliament we are put out of the royal protec 
tion, and consequently discharged from our allegiance; 
and it has become necessary to assume government for 
our immediate security, the governor, lieutenant governor, 
secretary, treasurer, commissary, attorney-general, should 
be chosen by joint ballot, of both houses. And these and 
all other elections, especially of representatives and coun 
cillors, should be annual, there not being in the whole cir 
cle of the sciences, a maxim more infall.ble than this, 
11 where annual elections end, there slavery begins." 



282 APPENDIX. 

These great men, in this respect, should be, once a 
year, 

* Like babble* on the sea of matter borne, 

" They rise, they break, and to that sea return." 

This will teach them the great political virtues of humil 
ity, patience, and moderation, without which every man 
in power becomes a ravenous beast of prey. 

This mode of constituting the great offices of state will 
answer very well for the present, but if, by experiment, it 
should be found inconvenient, the legislature may at its 
leisure devise other methods of creating them, by elections 
of the people at large, as in Connecticut, or it may en 
large the term for which they shall be chosen to seven 
years, or three years, or for life, or make any other altera 
tions which the society shall find productive of its ease, 
its safety, its freedom, or in one word its happiness. 

A rotation of all offices, as well as of representatives 
and councillors, has many advocates, and is contended for 
with many plausible arguments. It would be attended 
no doubt with many advantages, and if the society has a 
sufficient number of suitable characters to supply the 
great number of vacancies which would be made by such 
a rotation, I can see no objection to it. These persons 
may be allowed to serve for three years, and then be ex 
cluded three years, or for any longer or shorter term. 

Any seven or nine of the legislative council may be 
made a quorum, for doing business as a privy council, to 
advise the governor in the exercise of the executive branch 
of power, and in all acts of state. 

The governor should have the command of the militia, 
and of all your armies. The power of pardons should be 
with the governor and council. 

Judges, justices and all other officers, civil and military, 



APPENDIX. 283 

should be nominated and appointed by the governor, with 
the advice and consent of council, unless you choose to 
have a government more popular ; if you do, all officers, 
civil and military, may be chosen by joint ballot, of both 
houses, or in order to preserve the independence and im 
portance of each house, by ballot of one house, concurred 
in by the other. Shorills should he chosen by the freehold 
ers of counties so should registers of deeds and clerks 
of counties. 

All officers should have commissions, under the hand 
of the governor and seal of the colony. 

The dignity and stability of government in all its 
branches, the morals of the people and every blessing of 
society, depend so much upon an upright and skilful ad 
ministration of justice, that the judicial power ought to 
be distinct from both the legislative and executive, and in 
dependent upon both, that so it may be a check upon both, 
as both should be checks upon that. Tiie judges there 
fore should always be men of learning and experience in 
the laws, of exemplary morals, great patience, calmness, 
coolness and attention. Their minds should not be dis 
tracted with jarring interests; they should not be depend 
ent upon any man, or body of men. To these ends they 
should hold estates for life in their ofiices, or in other 
words their commissions should be during good behavior, 
and their salaries ascertained and established by law. 
For misbehavior the grand inquest of the colony, the 
house of representatives, should impeach them before the 
governor and council, where they should have time and 
opportunity to make their defence, but if convicted should 
be removed from their offices, and subjected to such other 
punishment as shall be thought proper. 

A militia law requiring all men, or with very few ex 
ceptions besides cases of conscience, to be provided with 
anus and ammunition, to be trained at certain seasons; and

requiring counties, towns, or other small districts to be 
provided with public stocks of ammunition and intrench 
ing utensils, and with some settled plans for transporting 
provisions after the militia, when marched to defend their 
country against sudden invasions; and requiring certain 
districts to be provided with field-pieces, companies of 
matrosses, and perhaps some regiments of light horse, is 
always a wise institution, and in the present circumstan 
ces of our country indispensable. 

Laws for the liberal education of youth, especially of 
the lower class of people, are so extremely wise and use 
ful, that to a humane and generous mind, no expense for 
this purpose would be thought extravagant. 

The very mention of sumptuary laws will excite a 
smile. Whether our countrymen have wisdom and vir 
tue enough to submit to them I know not. But the hap 
piness of the people might be greatly promoted by them, 
and a revenue saved sufficient to carry on this war for 
ever. Frugality is a great revenue, besides curing us of 
vanities, levities and fopperies which are real antidotes 
to all great, manly and warlike virtues. 

But must not all commissions run in the name of a 
king ? No. Why may they not as well run thus, " The 
colony of to A. B. greeting/ and be tested by the 

governor? 

Why may not writs, instead of running in the name of 
the king, run thus, " the colony of to the sheriff," 

&c. and be tested by the chief justice ? 

Why may not indictments conclude " against the peace 
of the colony of and the dignity of the same ? " 

A constitution, founded on these principles, introduces 
knowledge among the people, and inspires them with a 
conscious dignity, becoming freemen. A general emula 
tion takes place, which causes good humor, sociability, 
good manners, and good morals to be general. That ele-

vation of sentiment inspired by such a government, makes 
the common people brave and enterprising. That ambi 
tion which is inspired by it makes them sober, industrious 
and frugal. You will find among them some elegance, 
perhaps, but more solidity; a little pleasure, but a great 
deal of business ; some politeness, but more civility. If 
you compare such a country witli the regions of domina 
tion, whether monarchical or aristocratical, you will fan 
cy yourself fn Arcadia or Elisium. 

If the colonies should assume governments separately, 
they should be left entirely to their own choice of the 
forms, and if a continental constitution should be formed, 
it should be a congress, containing a fair and adequate 
representation of the colonies, and its authority should sa 
credly be confined to these cases, viz. war, trade, disputes 
between colony and colony, the post oflice, and the unap 
propriated lands of the crown, as they used to be called. 

These colonies, under such forms of government, and 
in such a union, would.be unconquerable by all the mon 
archies of Europe. v \ 

You and I, my dear friend, have been sent into life, at 
a time when the greatest lawgivers of antiquity would 
have wished to live. How fow of the human race have 
ever enjoyed an opportunity of making an election of gov 
ernment more than of air, soil or climate, for themselves 
or their children ! When before the present epocha, had 
three millions of people full power and a fair opportunity 
to form and establish the wisest and happiest government 
that human wisdom can contrive ? I hope you will avail 
yourself and your country of that extensive learning and 
indefatigable industry which you possess, to assist her in 
the formation of the happiest governments, and the best 
character of a great people. For myself, I must beg you 
to keep my name out of sight, for this feeble attempt, if 
it should be known to be mine, would oblige me to apply
