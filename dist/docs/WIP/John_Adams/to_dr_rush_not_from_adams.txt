Dr. Benjamin Rush — ^Philadelphia. 

St. Pstersburg 15 June 1S12. 

Dear Sir, — ^Your favours of 21 September and 15 
Jany. last have both been duly received — the first in 
January, and the last a few days since by Mr. Willing, 
Immediately after receiving the first, I requested the 
Chancellor, Count Romanzoff to present to His Imperial Majesty your thanks, for the distinguished honour 
with which he had accepted the copy of your Medical 
Works, and the assurance of the animated zeal for promoting the relief of suffering humanity which this token 
of His Majesty's favour would cherish in your breast 
The Count assured me that he should not fail to communicate this expression of your sensibility to His 
Majesty's notice, which he knew would be highly satisfactory to him. The absence of the Emperor and of Count Romanzoff both from this Capital at present will 
be my only inducement for postponing the information 
of your renewed thanks in the letter last received, untill 
their return. 

I consider it among the fortunate incidents of my life 
to have had the opportunity of being on this occasion, 
the medium of communication, in the honourable intercourse between Genius and Greatness: between the 
labours of learning and science, and the favours of Imperial Munificence. For this opportunity I am indebted 
to you, and it is to you that my thanks . are due, for 
having afforded it to me. I beg you to accept them 
accordingly, and to be assured that I am with the highest regard and respect 

Dear Sir, your very humble and obedt Servt

certainly cherish them, and try whether the climate of 
Monticello can preserve them without degeneracy. The 
arrival of GenL Davie here with the treaty is our only

again to France to pass the winter in it*s Southern parts 
for his health. Notwithstanding the annihilation of the 
Pennsylvania vote, the Republicans seem to have obtained a majority' of 8 in the late election. If so the

Washikgtok Mar. 24. 1801. 

Dear Sir, — I have to acknolege the receipt of your 
friendly favor of the 12 th. and the pleasing sensations produced in my mind by it's affectionate contents. 
I am made very happy by learning that the sentiments 
expressed in my inaugural address give general satisfaction, and hold out a ground on which our fellow 
citizens can once more unite. I am the more pleased 
because these sentiments have been long and radically 
mine, and therefore will be pursued honesdy and conscientiously. I know there is an obstacle which ver)' 
possibly may check the confidence which would otherwise have been more generally reposed in my observance 
of these principles. This obstacle does not arise from 
the measures to be pursued, as to which I am in no fear 
of giving satisfaction, but from appointments and disappointments as to office. With respect to appointments I have so much confidence in the justice and 
good sense of the federalists that I have no doubt they 
will concur in the fairness of the position, that after they 
have been in the exclusive possession of all offices from 
the very first origin of party among us to the 3nL of 
March at 9 o'clock in the night, no republican ever admitted, and this doctrine openly avowed, it is now perfectly just that the republicans should come in for the 
vacancies which may fall in, until something like an 
equilibrium in office be restored, after which " Tros, 
Tyriusque nuUo discrimine habeatur." But the great 
stumbling block will be removals, which tho' made on 
those just principles only on which my predecessor 
ought to have removed the same persons, will nevertheless be ascribed to removal on party principles. 
Imprimis I will expurge the effects of Mr. A's indecent conduct in crowding nominations after he knew 
they were not for himself, to 9 o'clock of the night at 
1 2 o'clock of which he was to go out of office, so far as 
they are during pleasure. I will not consider the persons named even as candidates for the office, nor pay 
the respect of notifying them that I consider what was 
done a nullity. 

2. Some removals must be made for misconduct 
One of these is of the marshal in your city, who being 
an officer of justice, entrusted with the sacred function 
of chusing impartial judges for the trial of his fellow 
citizens placed at the awful tribunal of God and their 
country, selected judges who either avowed, or were 
known to him to be predetermined to condemn, and if 
the lives of the unfortunate persons were not cut short 
by the sword of the law, it was not for want of his good 
will. In another state I have to perform the same act 
of justice on the dearest connection of my dearest 
friend, for similar conduct in cases not capital. 

The same practice of packing juries and prosecuting 
their fellow citizens with the bitterness of party hatred, 
will probably involve several other marshals and attornies. Out of this line I see but very few instances 
where past misconduct has been in such a degree as to 
call for notice. Of the thousands of officers therefore 
in the U. S. a very few individuals only, probably not 
20, will be removed, and these only for doing what they 
ought not to have done. 2 or 3 instances indeed where 
Mr. A. removed men because they would not sign addresses etc. to him, will be rectified, and the persons 
restored. The whole world will say this is just. I 
know that in stopping thus short in the career of re
moval I shall give great offence to many of my friends : 
that torrent has been pressing me heavily, and will require all my force to bear up against, but my maxim is 
" fiat justitia, mat coelum." After the first unfavorable 
impressions of doing too much in the opinions of some, 
and too little in that of others, shall be got over, I 
should hope a steady line of conciliation very practicable, and that without yielding a single republican principle. A certainty that these principles prevailed in 
the breasts of the main body of federalists was my motive for stating them as the ground of reunion. I have 
said thus much for your private satisfaction, to be used 
even in private conservation, as the presumptive principles on which we shall act, but not as proceeding from 
myself declaredly. Information received from France 
gives a high idea of the progress of science there. It 
seems to keep pace with their victories. I have just 
received for the A. P. society 2 volumes of Comparative Anatomy by Cuvier, probably the greatest work in 
that line that has ever appeared. His comparisons embrace every organ of the animal economy, and from 
man to the rotifer. Accept assurances of my sincere 
friendship and high consideration and respect 

Th. Jefferson.

Washington, Dec. 20. 1801. 

Dear Sir, — I have received your favor of Nov. 27. 
with your introductory lecture which I have read with 
the pleasure and edification I do every thing from you. 
I am happy to see that vaccination is introduced and 
likely to be kept up in Philadelphia, but I shall not think 
it exhibits all its utility until experience shall have hit 
upon some mark or rule by iHbicii the pc^mlar eye may 
disting^uish genuiDe from spurious ^inis. It was widi 
this view that I wished to cfisoover whether time oould 
not be made the standard, and supposed, from the 
litde experience I had, that matter, taken at 8 times 
24 hours from the time of insertion, would always be 
in the proper state. As fu* as I went I found it so, but 
I shall be happy to learn what the immense field of experience in Philadelphia will teadi us on that subject 

Our winter campaign has opened with more good 
humor than I expected ; b&gt;' sending a message, instead 
of making a speech at the opening of the session, I 
have prevented the bloody conflicts to which the making 
an answer would have committed them. They consequendy were able to set into real business at once, 
without losing 10 or 12 days in combating an answer. 
Hitherto there has been no disagreeable altercations. 
The suppression of useless offices, and lopping off the 
parasitical plant engrafted at the last session on the 
judiciary body, will probably produce some. Bitter 
men are not pleased with the suppression of taxes. 
Not daring to condemn the measure they attack the 
motive ; and too disingenuous to ascribe it to the honest 
one of freeing our citizens from unnecessary burthens, 
and unnecessary systems of officers, they ascribe it to a 
desire of popularity-. But every honest man will suppose honest acts to flow from honest principles ; and 
the rogues may rail without interruption. 

My health has been always so uniformly firm, thai I 
have for some years dreaded nothing so much as the 
living too long. I think however that a flaw has appeared which ensures me against that, without cutting 
short any of the period during which I could expect to 
remain capable of being useful. It will probably give 
me as many years as I wish, and without pain or debility. Should this be the case, my most anxious prayers 
will have been fulfilled by heaven. I have said as much 
to no mortal breathing, and my florid health is calculated 
to keep my friends as well as foes quiet as they should 
be. Accept assurances of my constant esteem and 
high respect 

Th. Jefferson.

Washington Oct. 4. 03. 

Dear Sir, — No one would more willingly than myself pay the just tribute due to the services of Capt. 
Barry, by writing a letter of condolence to his widow 
as you suggest, but when one imdertakes to administer 
justice it must be with an even hand and by rule ; what 
is done for one, must be done for every one in equal 
degree. To what a train of attentions would this draw 
a President ? How difficult would it be to draw the 
line between that degree of merit entided to such a 
testimonial of it, and that not so entided if drawn in a 
pardcular case differently from what the friends of the 
deceased would judge right, what offence would it give, 
and of the most tender kind? How much offence 
would be given by accidental inattentions, or want of 
information ? The first steps into such an undertaking 
ought to be well weighed. On the death of Dr. Franklin the King and convention of France went into mourning, so did the House of Rep's of the U. S., the Senate 
refused. I proposed to Gen. Washington that the 
Executive department should wear mourning, he declined it, because he said he should not know where to 


draw the line if he once began that ceremony. Mr. 
Adams was then Vice President, and I thought Gen. 
W. had his eye on him, whom he certainly did not love. 
I told him the world had drawn so broad a line between 
himself and Dr. Franklin on the one side, and the residue of mankind on the other, that we might wear 
mourning for them, and the question still remain new 
and undecided as to all others, he thought it best however to avoid it, on these considerations alone, however 
well affected to the merit of Commodore Barry, I think 
it prudent not to engage myself in a practice which may 
become embarrassing. 

Tremendous times in Europe ! How mighty this 
battle of lions and tigers! With what sensations 
should the common herd of catde look on it ? With 
no partialities certainly, if they can so far worry one 
another as to destroy their power of tyrannizing the 
one over the earth, the other the waters, the world 
may perhaps enjoy peace, till they recruit again. 
Affectionate and respectful salutations. 

Th. Jefferson.

MONTICELLO Aug. 8. 04. 

Dear Sir, — ^Your favor of the ist inst. came to hand 
last night The embarrassment of answering propositions for office negatively, and the inconveniences which 
have sometimes arisen from answering affirmatively, 
even when the affirmative is intended, has led to the 
general rule of leaving the answer to be read in the 
act of appointment or non-appointment whenever either 
is manifested. I depart from the rule however in the 
present case, that no injury may arise from that suspension of opinion which would be removed at once by a 
communication of the fact that there is no probability 
that Col. Monroe will quit his present station at any 
time now under contemplation. The departure of a 
person as his secretary not long since, at his particular 
request, proves he has no such intention, and certainly 
we do not wish it, as his services give the most perfect 
satisfaction. We had begun by appointing secretaries 
of legation, for the purpose of giving young men opportunities of qualifying themselves for public service : 
but desirable and useful as this would have been, it's 
aptness to produce discord has obliged us to abandon 
it, and to leave the ministers to appoint their own private secretaries, whose dependence on their principal 
secures a compatibility of temper. 

I shall be happy to receive your pamphlet, as I am 
whatever comes from you. I have also a little volume, 
a mere and faithful compilation which I shall some of 
these days ask you to read as containing the exemplification of what I advanced in a former letter as to the 
excellence of " the philosophy of Jesus of Nazareth." 
Accept affectionate salutations and assurances of esteem 
and respect. 

Th. Jefferson.

Washington June 13. 05. 

Dear Sir, — A considerable time before the receipt 
of your letter of Apr. 29, it was known here that Mr. 
Boudinot intended to retire from the Direction of the 

mint, and as was expected, immediately it had therefore 
been made a question to the members of the administration who should be his successor. It was supposed 
that the duties of that office required the best mathematical talents which could be found, as well on account 
of the mechanical execution, as the difficulty of the 
problems constandy occurring on the mixture of metals. 
The appointment of Sir Isaac Newton in England and 
of Mr. Rittenhouse here with the universal satisfaction 
these appointments had given seemed to give the sanction of the world to this principle of appointment, and 
therefore it was the general opinion of the members 
that Mr. Patterson should be placed at the head of the 
mint, which was notified to him. It is true that this had 
not always been observed as the principle of appointment, but it was thought best to follow the best examples. Altho the ground of this appointment is so 
distinct from your line of pursuit that it can give you 
no uneasiness, yet I could not deny to myself the satisfaction of explaining it It is indeed far the most painful part of my duty, under which nothing could support 
me but the consideration that I am but a machine 
erected by the constitution for the performance of certain acts according to laws of action laid down for 
me, one of which is that I must anatomise the living 
man as the Surgeon does his dead subject, view him 
also as a machine and employ him for what he is fit for, 
unblinded by the mist of friendship. Accept affectionate salutations and assurances of constant esteem and 
respect.

MONTICELLO Sep. 22. 09. 

Dear Doctor, — I have long owed you a letter in 
answer to yours of May 3, an acknowledgement of the 
receipt of the pamphlet on the use of the omentum, 
and congratulations on the satisfaction you must derive 
from having a son, entering, under auspices so promising, the career you have run before him. I am not 
enough in these branches of science to decide on the 
soundness of the hypothesis maintained in the pamphlet, but I have read it with pleasure as a logical investigation of a curious question, and adding usefully 
to our knowledge of the animal economy. 

I am become sensible of a great advantage your 
profession has over most others, that, to the close of 
your life, you can be always doing good to mankind : 
whereas a redred politician is like a broken down 
courser, unfit for the turf, and good for little else. I am 
endeavoring to recover the litde I once knew of farming, gardening, etc., and would gladly now exchange 
any branch of science I possess for the knowledge 
of a common farmer. Too old to learn I must be contented with the occupation and amusement of the art 
Already it keeps me so much without doors that I have 
litde time to read, and still less to write. This must be 
my apology for the tardiness of the present letter. 

I find I am losing sight of the progress of the world 
of letters. Here we talk but of rains and droughts, of 
blights and frosts, of our ploughs and catde ; and if 
the topic changes to politics I meddle litde with them. 
In truth I never had a cordial relish for them, and abhor 
the contentions and strife they generate. You know 
what were the times which forced us both from our first 
loves, the natural sciences. The interest I have taken 
in the success of the experiment, whether a government 
can be contrived which shall secure man in his rightful 
liberties and acquirements, has engaged a longer portion of my life than I had ever proposed: and certainly 
the experiment could never have fallen into more inauspicious times, when nations have openly renounced 
all obligations of morality, and shamelessly assume the 
character of robbers and pyrates. In any other time 
our experiment would have been more easy ; and if it 
can pass safely through the ordeal of the present trial, 
we may hope we have set an example which will not be 
without consequences favorable to human happiness. 
May we not hope that when the robbers of Copenhagen, 
and the ravagers of Spain shall be arrested in their 
course by those means which providence has always in 
reserve for the restoration of order among his works, 
the pendulum will vibrate tfie more strongly in the 
opposite direction, and that nations will return to the 
reestablishment of moral law with an enthusiasm which 
shall more solidly confirm it's future empire. So be it, 
and God bless you. 

Th. Jefferson.

MoNTiCELLO Mar. 6. 13. 

Dear Sir, — I received some time ago a letter signed 
" James Carver" proposing that myself, and my friends 
in this quarter should subscribe and forward a sum of 
money toward the expenses of his voyage to London 
and maintenance there, while going thro* a course of 
education in their Veterinary school, with a view to his 

returning to America, and practising the art in Philadelphia. The name, person and character of the writer 
were equally unknown to me, and unauthendcated, but 
as self-declared in the letter. I supposed him an Englishman from the style in which he spoke of " his majesty'* and because an American, without offence to the 
laws, could not now be going, nor be sent by private 
individuals to England. The scheme did not appear to 
me either the shortest or surest way of going to work 
to accomplish the object, because if the Veterinary institution there be of the celebrity he described, it must 
already have produced subjects prepared for entering 
into practice, and disposed to come to a good position, 
claiming nothing till they should enter into function, or 
not more than their passage. I did not receive the 
letter until the day had elapsed on which the vessel was 
to depart wherein he had taken his passage : and his 
desire that the answer should go thro' you, is my only 
authority for troubling you with this, addressed too to 
you, whom I know, love and revere, and not to him, 
who, for any evidence I have but from himself, may be 
a zealous son of science, or an adventurer wanting 
money to carry him to London. I know nothing of the 
Veterinary institution of London, yet have no doubt it 
merits the high character he ascribes to it. It is a 
nation which possesses many learned men. I know 
well the veterinary school of Paris, of long standing, 
and saw many of it's publications during my residence 
there. They were classically written, announced a want 
of nothing but certainty as to their facts, which granted, 
their hypotheses were learned and plausible. The 
coach-horses of the rich of Paris were availed of the 
institution ; but the farmers, even of the neighborhood, 
could not afford to call a Veterinary Doctor to their 
plough horses in the country, or to send them to a livery 
stable to be attended in the city. On the whole I was 
not a convert to the utility of the Institution. You 
know I am so to that of medicine, even in human complaints, but in a limited degree. That there are certain 
diseases of the human body, so distinctly pronounced 
by well articulated symptoms, and recurring so often as 
not to be mistaken, wherein experience has proved that 
certain substances applied will restore order, I cannot 
doubt. Such are kinkina in intermittents, mercury in 
syphilis, castor oil in dysentery, etc., and so far I go 
with the physicians. But there are also a great mass 
of indistinct diseases, presenting themselves under no 
form clearly characterized, nor exactly recognized as 
having occurred before, and to which of course the application of no particular substance can be known to 
have been made, nor it*s effect on the case experienced, 
these may be called unknown cases, and they may in 
time be lessened by the progress of observation and 
experiment. Observing that there are in the constitution of the animal system some means provided unknown to us which have a tendency to restore order 
when disturbed by accident, called by physicians the vis 
medicatrix naturae, I think it safer to trust to this power 
in the unknown cases, than to uncertain conjectures 
built on the ever changing hypothetical systems of medicine. Now in the Veterinary department, all are unknown cases. Man can tell his physician the seat of 
his pain, it's nature, history, and sometimes it's cause, 
and can follow his directions for the curative process, 
but the poor dumb horse cannot signify where his pain 
is, what it is, or when or whence it came, and resists all 
process for it's cure. If in the case of man then the 
benefit of medical interference in such cases admits of 
question, what must it be in that of the horse ? and to 
what narrow limits is the real importance of the veterinary art reduced ? When a boy I knew a Doctr. Seymour, neighbor to our famous botanist Clayton who 
imagined he could cure the diseases of his tobacco 
plants. He bled some, administered lotions to others, 
sprinkled powders on a third class, and so on. They 
only withered and perished the fester. I am sensible 
of the presumption of hazarding an opinion to you on 
a subject whereon you are so much better qualified for 
decision, both by reading and experience, but our opinions are not voluntary. Every man's own reason must 
be his oracle, and I only express mine to explain why I 
did not comply with Mr. Carver's request, and to give 
you a further proof that there are no bounds to my 
confidence in your indulgence in matters of opinion. 

Mr. Adams and myself are in habitual correspondence. I owe him a letter at this time, and shall pay 
the debt as soon as I have something to write about, 
for with the commonplace topic of politics, we do not 
meddle. When there are so many others on which we 
agree why should we introduce the only one on which 
we differ ? Besides the pleasure which our naval successes have given to every honest patriot, his must be 
peculiar, because a navy has always been his hobby 
horse. A little further time will shew whether his 
ideas have been premature, and whether the little we 
can oppose on that element to the omnipotence of our 
enemy there, would lessen the losses of the war, or 
contribute to shorten it's duration, the legitimate object of every measure. On the land indeed we have 
i&gt;een most unfortunate. So wretched a succession of 
jenerals never before destroyed the fairest expecta:ions of a nation, counting on the bravery of it's citizens, which has proved itself on all these trials. Our 
irst object now must be the vindication of our charicter in the field : after that, peace, with the liberum 
nare, personal inviolability there, and ouster from this 
:ontinent of the incendiaries of savages. God send us 
these good things, and to you health and life here, till 
you wish to awake to it in another state of being. 

Th. Jefferson. 
DocTR. Rush.
