MY letters to you are an odd mixture. They would appear to a stranger like the dish which is sometimes called omnium gatherum. This is the first time, I 
believe, that these two words were ever put together in writing. The literal interpretation I take to he "a 
collection of all things." But, as I said before, the 
words having never before been written, it is not possible to be very learned in telling you what the Arabic, Syriac, Chaldaic, Greek and Roman commentators say upon the subject. Amidst all the rubbish that constitutes the heap, you will see a proportion of 
affection for my friends, my family and country, that 
gives a complexion to the whole. I have a very tender, feeling heart. This country knows not, and never 
can know the torments, I have endured. for its sake. 
I am glad it never can know, for it would give more pain to the benevolent and humane, than I could wish even the wicked and malicious to feel.

I have seen in this world but a little of that pure flame of patriotism which certainly burns in some breasts. There is much of the ostentation and affectation of it. I have known a few, who could not bear 
to entertain a selfish design, nor to be suspected by others of such a meanness ; but these are not the most respected by the world. A man must be selfish, even 
to acquire great popularity. He must grasp for him self, under specious pretences for the public good, and he must attach himself to his relations, connexions, 
and friends, by becoming a champion for their interests, in order to form a phalanx about him for his own defence, to make them trumpeters of his praise, and sticklers for his fame, fortune and honor.

My friend Warren, the late Governor Ward, and Mr. Gadsden are three characters, in which I have seen the most generous disdain of every spice and 
species of such meanness. The two last had not great abilities, but they had pure hearts. Yet they had less influence than many others, who had neither so 
considerable parts, nor any share at all of their purity of intention. Warren has both talents and virtues beyond most men in this world, yet his character has 
never been in proportion. Thus it always is, and has been and will be. Nothing has ever given me more 
mortification than a suspicion that has been propagated of me, that I am actuated by private views, and have been aiming at high places. The office of chief 
justice has occasioned this jealousy, and it never will be allayed, until I resign it. Let me have my farm, family and goosequill, and all the honors and offices 
this world has to bestow, may go to the?, who deserve them better and desire them more. I court them not

There are very few people in this world with whom I can bear to converse. I can treat all with decency 
and civility, and converse with them, when it is necessary, on points of business. But I am never happy 
in their company. This has made me a recluse, and will, one day, make me a hermit. I had rather build 
stone wall upon Penn's hill, than to be the first prince in Europe, or the first General, or first Senator in America.
