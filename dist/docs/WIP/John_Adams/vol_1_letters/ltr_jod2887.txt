IT is now generally believed that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a> 
has killed and taken at least two thousand of Mr. Howe's army since Christmas. Indeed the evidence 
of it is from the General's own letters. You know I 
ever thought Mr. Howe's march through the Jerseys 
a rash step. It has proved so. But how much more 
so would it have been thought, if the Americans 
could all have viewed it in that light, and exerted 
themselves, as they might and ought The whole 
flock would infallibly have been taken in the net

The little nest of hornets in Rhode Island ! Is it 
to remain unmolested this winter ? The honor of 
New England is concerned. If they are not ousted, 
I will never again glory in being a New England 
man. There are now New England Generals, officers and soldiers, and if something is not done, any 
man may, after that, call New England men poltroons, 
with all my heart.
