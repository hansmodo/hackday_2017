ARTILLERY Election! I wish I was at it or near it Yours of the 18th reached me this morning. The cause that letters are so long in travelling is, that 
there is but one post in a week, who goes from hence to Peekskill, although there are two that go from 
thence to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. Riding every day has made me 
better than I was, although I am not yet quite well. I am determined to continue this practice, which is very necessary for me.

I rejoice to find that the town have had the wisdom to send but one Representative. The House last year was too numerous and unwieldy. The expense was 
too great. I suppose you will have a constitution formed this year. Who will be the Moses, the Lycurgus, the Solon? or have you a score or two of 
such ? Whoever they may be, and whatever form may be adopted, I am persuaded there is among the mass of our people a fund of wisdom, integrity and 
humanity, which will preserve their happiness in a tolerable measure.

If the enemy comes to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> again, fly with your 
little ones, all of them to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. But they 
will scarcely get to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> this campaign. I admire 
your sentiments concerning revenge. Revenge in ancient days, (you will see it through the whole Roman History) was esteemed a generous and an heroic 
passion. Nothing was too good for a friend, or too bad for an enemy. Hatred and malice without limits against an enemy were indulged, were justified, and 
no cruelty was thought unwarrantable. Our Saviour taught the immorality of revenge, and the moral duty of 
forgiving injuries, and even the duty of loving enemies. Nothing can shew the amiable, the moral, the divine excellency of these Christian doctrines in a 
stronger point of light than the characters and conduct of Marius and Sylla, Crcsar, Pompey, Antony 
and Augustus, among innumerable others. Retaliation we must practise in some instances, in order to 
make our barbarous foes respect, in some degree, the rights of humanity. But this will never be done with out the most palpable necessity. The apprehension 
of retaliation alone will restrain them from cruelties which would disgrace savages. To omit it then would be crucify to ourselves, our officers and men.

We are amused here with reports of troops removing from Rhode Island, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, Staten Island, &c ; 
waggons, boats, bridges, &c., prepared ; two old Indiamen cut down into floating batteries, mounting 
thirty-two guns, sent round into Delaware river, &c., &c ; but I heed it no more than the whistling of the zephyrs. In short, I had rather they should come to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> than not. It would purify this city of 
its dross. Either the furnace of affliction would refine it of its impurities, or it would be purged yet so as by fire. This town has been a dead weight upon 
us. It would be a dead weight upon the enemy. The mules here would plague them more than all their money.
