YESTERDAY, yours of October 9th came to hand. Your 
letters never failed to give me pleasure. The greatest 
pleasure that I take, is in receiving them. And although 
every one, which has yet come to hand, is replete with 
melancholy tidings, yet I can truly say, I never was 
so earnest to receive them. I rejoice in the happy 
principles and the happy temper which apparently dictated them all. 
</p><p>
I feel myself much affected with the breach upon 
the family. But we can count a mother, a brother, 
an aunt, and a brother's child among the slain by this 
cruel pestilence. May God Almighty put a stop to its rage and humble us under the ravages already 
made by it. The sorrows of all our friends, on the I loss of your mother, are never out of my mind. I pray God to spare my parent, whose life has been 
prolonged by his goodness hitherto, as well as yours 
that survives. The tremendous calamities already 
felt of fire, sword and pestilence may be only harbingers of greater still. We have no security against 
calamity here. This planet is its region. The only 
principle is to be prepared for the worst events. 
</p><p>
If I could write as well as you, my sorrow would 
be as eloquent as yours, but, upon my word, I cannot. 
</p><p>
The unaccountable event, which you allude to, has 
reached this place and occasioned a fall. I would be 
glad, however, that the worst construction might not be 
put. Let him l have fair play ; though I doubt. 
</p><p>
The man who violates private faith, cancels solemn 
obligations, whom neither honor nor conscience holds, 
shall never be knowingly trusted by me. Had I 
known, when I first voted for a Director of an Hospital, 
what I heard afterwards, when I was down, I would 
not have voted as I did. Open, barefaced immorality 
ought not to be so countenanced. Though I think a 
fatality attends us in some instances, yet a divine protection and favor is visible in others ; and let us be 
cheerful, whatever happens. Cheerfulness is not a sin in any times. 
</p><p>
I am afraid to hear again almost, lest some other should be sick in the house. V Yet I hope better, and 
that you will reassume your wonted cheerfulness and write again upon news and politics. Send your letters to Warren for conveyance. I won t trust any other.
