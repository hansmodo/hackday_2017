I THIS day received yours of the 29th of September and the 1st of October. Amidst ail your afflictions, I am rejoiced to find that you all along preserve so 
proper and so happy a temper ; that you are sensible 
" the consolations of religion are the only sure comforters." It is the constitution under which we are 
born, that if we live long ourselves, we must bury 
our parents, and all our elder relations, and many of 
those who are younger. I have lost a parent, a child 
and a brother, and each of them left a lasting impression on my mind. But you and I have many 
more relations and very good friends to follow to the 
house appointed for all flesh, or else we must be followed by them. I bewail, more than I can express, 
the loss of your excellent mother. I mourn the loss 
of so much purity, and unaffected piety and virtue, 
to tho world. I know of no better character left in 
it I grieve for you, and your brother and sisters. I 
grieve for your father, whose age will need the succor of so excellent a companion. But I grieve for 
nobody more than my children. Her most amiable 
and discreet example, as well as her kind skill and 
care, I have ever relied upon in my own mind, for the education of these little swarms. Not that I have not a proper esteem for the capacity and disposition of the mother, but I know that the efforts of the 
grandmother are of great importance, when they 
second those of the parent. And I am sure that my 
children are the better for the forming hand of their 
grandmother. It gives me great joy to learn that ours 
are well. Let us be thankful for this, and many 
other blessings yet granted us. Pray, my dear, 
cherish in their minds the remembrance of their grandmamma, and remind them of her precepts and 
example. God Almighty grant to you and to every 
branch of the family, all the support that you want. 
You and I, my dear, have reason, if ever mortals 
had, to be thoughtful ; to look forward beyond the transitory scene. Whatever is preparing for us, let us be 
prepared to receive. It is time for us to subdue our 
passions of every kind. The prospect before us is 
an ocean of uncertainties, in which no pleasing objects 
appear. We have few hopes, excepting that of pre 
serving our honor and our consciences untainted, and 
a free Constitution to our country. Let me be sure 
of these, and, amidst all my weaknesses, I cannot be 
overcome. With these, I can be happy in extreme 
poverty, in humble insignificance, may I hope and 
believe, in death : Without them, I should be miserable with a crown upon my head, millions in my coiTbrs and a gaping, idolizing multitude at my feet.

My heart is too full of grief for you and our friends, 
to whom I wish you to present my regards, to say 
anything of news or politics. Yet the affair of the 
Surgeon-General is so strange and important an event, 
that I cannot close this gloomy letter without adding 
a sigh for this imprudent, unfortunate man. I know 
not whether the evidence will support the word 
treachery, but what may we not expect after treachery to himself, his wife and children ?
