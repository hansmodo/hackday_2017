I HAVE written so seldom to you, that I am really grieved at the recollection. I wrote you a few lines June 2, and a few more June 16. These are all 
that I have written to you, since this month began. It has been the busiest month that ever I saw. I 
have found time to enclose all the newspapers, which I hope you will receive in due time.

Our misfortunes in Canada are enough to melt a 
heart of stone. The small pox is ten times more 
terrible than Britons, Canadians and Indians, together. 
This was the cause of our precipitate retreat from 
Quebec. This the cause of our disgraces at the 
Cedars. I Don't mean that this was all. There has 
been want approaching to famine, as well as pestilence And these discouragements have so disheartened our officers, that none of them seem to act with 
prudence and firmness. But these reverses of for 
tune Don't discourage me. It was natural to expect 
them, and we ought to be prepared in our minds 
for greater changes, and more melancholy scenes 
still. It is an animating cause, and brave spirits are 
not subdued with difficulties.

Amidst all our gloomy prospects in Canada, we 
receive some pleasure from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. I congratulate 
you on your victory over your enemies in the harbor. This has long lain near my heart, and it gives 
me great pleasure to think that what was so much 
wished is accomplished. I hope our people will now 
make the lower harbor impregnable, and never 
again suffer the flag of a tyrant to fly within any 
part of it.

The Congress have been pleased to give me more 
business than I am qualified for, and more than, I 
fear, I can go through with safety to my health. 
They have established a board of war and ordnance, 
and made me President of it, I an honor to which I 
never aspired, a trust to which I feel myself vastly 
unequal. But I am determined to do as well as I can, 
and make industry supply, in some degree, the place 
of abilities and experience. The Board sits every 
morning and every evening. This with constant 
attendance in Congress will so entirely engross my 
time, that I fear, I shall not be able to write you so 
often as I have. But I will steal time to write to 
you.

The small pox ! the small pox ! what shall we do with it ? I could almost wish that an inoculating Hospital was opened in every town in New England, 
It is some small consolation that the scoundrel savages have taken a large dose of it. They plundered the 
baggage and stripped off the clothes of our men who had the small pox out full upon them at the Cedars.
