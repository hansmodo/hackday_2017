YOURS of 21 April came to hand yesterday. I send 
you regularly every newspaper, and write as often as 
I can ; but I feel more skittish about writing than I 
did, because, since the removal of head-quarters to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, we have no express, and very few individual travellers ; and the post I am not quite confident in ; however, I shall write as I can. 
</p><p>
What shall I do with my office ? I want to resign it for a thousand reasons. Would you advise me ?

There has been a gallant battle in Delaware river 
between the galleys and two men of war, the 
Roebuck and Liverpool, in which the men of war 
came off second best ; which has diminished, in the 
minds of the people on both sides of the river, the terror of a man of war.

I long to hear a little of my private affairs ; yet I 
dread it too, because I know you must be perplexed 
and distressed. I wish it was in my power to relieve 
you. It gives me great pleasure to learn, that our 
rulers are, at last, doing something towards the fortification of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. But I am inexpressibly chagrined 
to find that the enemy is fortifying on George's Island. 
I never shall be easy, until they are completely driven 
out of that harbor, and effectually prevented from ever 
getting in again. As you are a politician and now 
elected into an important office, that of judgess of the 
Tory ladies, which will give you, naturally, an influence with your sex, I hope you will be instant, in sea 
son and out of season, in exhorting them to use 
their influence with the gentlemen, to fortify upon 
George's Island, LovelFs, Pettick's, Long, or wherever 
else it is proper. Send down fire ships and rafts, and 
burn to ashes those pirates. I am out of patience with 
the languid, lethargic councils of the province, at such 
a critical, important moment, puzzling their heads 
about twopenny fees, and confession bills, and what 
not, when the harbor of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> is defenceless. If I 
was there, I should storm and thunder like Demosthenes, or scold like a tooth-drawer. Do ask Mr. Wibird and Mr. Weld and Mr. Taft to preach about 
it. I am ashamed, vexed, angry to the last degree. 
Our people, by their turpitude, have invited the enemy to come to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> again, and I fear they will have 
the civility and politeness to accept the invitation.

Your uncle has never answered my letter. Thank 
the Doctor, he has written me a most charming letter, 
full of intelligence, and very sensible and useful re 
marks. I will pay the debt, as far as my circumstances will admit, and as soon. But I hope my friends 
will not wait for regular returns from me. I have not 
yet left off pitying " the fifty or sixty men ; " and if 
my friends knew all that I do, they would pity too.

Betsey Smith, lazy hussy, has not written me a line a great while. I wish she was married ; then 
she would have some excuse. Duty to papa. Love to all. How is the family over against the church ?
