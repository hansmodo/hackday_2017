AT half past four this morning I mounted my horse and took a ride in a road that was new to me. I went to Kensington and then to " Point-no-point" by 
land, the place where I went once before with a large company in the row galleys by water. That frolic was almost two years ago. I gave you a relation of 
it in the time, I suppose. The road to Point-no-point lies along the river Delaware, in fair sight of it and its opposite shore. For near four miles the road is 
as strait as the streets of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. On each side, 
are beautiful rows of trees, buttonwoods, oaks, walnuts, cherries and willows, especially down towards 
the banks of the river. The meadows, pastures and grass plats are as green as leeks. There are many 
fruit trees and fine orchards set with the nicest regularity. But the fields of grain, the rye and wheat 
exceed all description. These fields are all sown in ridges and the furrow between each couple of ridges 
is as plainly to be seen as if a swath had been mown along. Yet it is no wider than a ploughshare 
and it is as strait as an arrow. It looks as if the sower had gone along the furrow with his spectacles 
to pick up every grain that should accidentally fall into it. The corn is just coming out of the ground. 
The furrows struck out for the hills to be planted in, are each way as straight, as mathematical right lines ; 
and the squares between every four hills as exact as they could be done by plumb and line, or scale and compass.

I am ashamed of our farmers. They are a lazy, ignorant set ; in husbandry, I mean ; for they know infinitely more of every thing else than these. But 
after all, the native face of our country, diversified as it is with hill and dale, sea and land, is to me more agreeable than this enchanting artificial scene.

The post brought me yours of May 6th and 9th. You express apprehensions that we may be driven 
from this city. We have no such apprehensions here. Howe is unable to do any thing but by stealth. Washington is strong enough to keep Howe where he is.

How could it happen that you should have 5 counterfeit New Hampshire money ? can't you recollect who you had it of? Let me entreat you not to 
take a shilling of any but continental money or Massachusetts, and be very careful of that There is a 
counterfeit continental bill abroad sent out of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, but it will deceive none but fools, for it is cop 
per plate, easily detected, miserably done.
