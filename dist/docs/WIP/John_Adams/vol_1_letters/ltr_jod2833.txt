IT is some time since I wrote you, and I have nothing 
now to write, but repetitions of respect and affection. I 
am anxious to hear from you. I hope the family is 
better ; that your grief for the great loss we have all 
sustained is somewhat abated. I hope your father 
and sister Betsey are well, though they must be 
greatly afflicted. Give my love to Betsey, and let 
her know that I feel most intimately for her, as well 
as for myself and the rest. I consider the stroke 
must fall heavier upon her, as it was nearer to her. 
Her prosperity is near my heart. I wish her every 
blessing which she can possibly wish for herself. 
</p><p>
Really it is very painful to be four hundred miles 
from one's family and friends, when we know they 
are in affliction. It seems as if it would be a joy to me 
to fly home, even to share with you your burdens and 
misfortunes. Surely, if I were with you, it would be 
my study to allay your griefs, to mitigate your pains, 
and to divert your melancholy thoughts. When I 
</p><p>
shall come home, I know not. We have so much to 
do, and it is so difficult to do it right, that \vc must 
learn patience. Upon my word, I think, if ever I 
were to come here again, I must bring you with me. 
I could live here pleasantly, if I had you with me. 
W T ill you come and have the small pox I here ? I 
wish I could remove all the family, our little daughter 
and sons, and all go through the distemper here. 
What if we should ? Let me please myself with the 
thought however.

Congress has appointed Mr. Wythe, Mr. Deanc 
and me, a Committee to collect an account of the hostilities committed by the troops and ships, with proper 
evidence of the number and value of the houses and 
other buildings destroyed or damaged, the vessels captivated, and the cattle, sheep, hogs, &c., taken. We 
are about writing to all the general assemblies of New 
England, and to many private gentlemen in each 
colony, to assist us in making the collections. The 
gentlemen with me are able men. Deane's character, you know. He is a very ingenious man and an 
able politician. Wythe is a new member from Virginia, a lawyer of the highest eminence in that pro 
vince, a learned and very laborious man ; so that we 
may hope this commission will be well executed. A 
tale of woe it will be ! Such a scene of distress and 
destruction, and so patiently and magnanimously 
borne ! Such a scene of cruelty and barbarity, so 
unfeelingly committed ! I mention this to you, my dear, that you may look up, and transmit to me, a 
paper which Colonel Palmer lent me, containing a relation of the Charlestown battle, which was transmit 
ted to England by the Committee of safety. This paper I must have, or a copy of it.

I wish I could collect, from the people of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> or others, a proper set of paintings of the scenes of distress and misery brought upon that town from the 
commencement of the Port bill. Posterity must hear a story that shall make their ears to tingle. 
</p><p>
Yours, yours, yours.
