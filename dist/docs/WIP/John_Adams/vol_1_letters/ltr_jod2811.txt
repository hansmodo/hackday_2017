MY DEAR,
</p><p>
IN your last, I you inquire tenderly after my health, 
and how we found the people upon our journey, and how we were treated. I have enjoyed as good health 
as usual, and much more than I know how to account for, when I consider the extreme heat of the weather, and the incessant feasting I have endured ever since I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. 
</p><p>
The people in Connecticut, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, the Jerseys, and Pennsylvania, we have found extremely well principled, and very well inclined, although some persons 
in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> wanted a little animation. Their zeal, however, has increased wonderfully since we began our journey. When the horrid 
news was brought here of the bombardment of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, which made us completely miserable for two 
days, we saw proofs both of the sympathy and the 
resolution of the continent. War! war! war! was 
the cry, and it was pronounced in a tone which would 
have done honor to the oratory of a Briton or a Roman. If it had proved true, you would have heard the thunder of an American Congress. 
</p><p>
I have not time, nor language to express the hospitality and the studied and expensive respect with 
which we have been treated in every stage of our progress. If Camden, Chatham, Richmond and St. Asaph 
had travelled through the country, they could not have been entertained with greater demonstrations of respect than Cusjiing, Paine, and the brace of Adamses 
have been. The particulars will amuse you when we return. 
</p><p>
I confess, the kindness, the affection, the applause 
which have been given to me, and especially to our 
province, have many n time filled my bosom and 
streamed from my eyes. My best respects to Colonel Warren and his lady 
when you write to them. I wish to write them.
</p><p>
Adieu.
