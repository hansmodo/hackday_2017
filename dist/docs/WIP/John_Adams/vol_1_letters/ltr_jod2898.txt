Howe, as you know my opinion always was, will 
repent his mad march through the Jerseys. The 
people of that Commonwealth begin to raise their 
spirits exceedingly and to be firmer than ever. They 
are actuated by resentment now, and resentment, coinciding with principle, is a very powerful motive.

I have got into the old routine of war office and 
Congress, which takes up my time in such a manner 
that I can scarce write a line. I have not time to 
think nor to speak. There is a United States Lottery 
abroad. I believe you had better buy a ticket and 
make a present of it to our four sweet ones. Let us try their luck. I hope they will be more lucky than 
their papa has ever been, or ever will be. I am as well 
as can be expected. How it happens I Don't know, nor 
how long it will last. My disposition was naturally gay 
and cheerful, but the prospects I have ever had before 
me and these cruel times will make me melancholy. 
I, who would not hurt the hair of the head of any 
animal, I, who am always made miserable by tho 
misery of every susceptible being that comes to my 
knowledge, am obliged to hear continual accounts of 
the barbarities, the cruel murders in cold blood even 
by the most tormenting ways of starving and freezing, 
committed by our enemies, and continued accounts of 
the deaths and diseases contracted by their own imprudence. These accounts harrow me beyond description. These incarnate demons say in great composure, that " humanity is a yankee virtue, but that 
they are governed by policy." Is there any policy 
on this side of hell, that is inconsistent with humanity ? 
I have no idea of it. I know of no policy, God is my 
witness, but this, piety, humanity and honesty are the 
best policy. Blasphemy, cruelty and villany have 
prevailed and may again. But they won t prevail 
against America in this contest, because I find, the 
more of them are employed, the less they succeed.
