THE riding has been so hard and rough, and the weather so cold, that we have not been able to push 
further than this place. My little colt has performed very well hitherto, and I think, will carry me through this journey very pleasantly. 
</p><p>
Our spirits have been cheered by two or three pieces of good news, which Commissary Trumbull, who is now with me, tells us he saw yesterday, in a 
letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a>, who has gained another considerable advantage of the enemy at Stony Brook, in the Jerseys, as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=isp" rel="met colleague">General Putnam</a> has gained 
another at Burlington, and the Jersey militia a third. The particulars you will have, before this reaches you, in the public prints. The communication of 
intelligence begins to be more open, and we have no apprehensions of danger in the route we shall take. Howe has reason to repent of his rashness, and will have more.

My love to my dear little ones. They are all very good children, and I have no doubt will continue so. I will drop a line as often as I can. 
</p><p>
Adieu.
