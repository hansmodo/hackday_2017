YOURS of 23d June I have received. I believe there is no danger of an invasion your way, but the designs 
of the enemy are uncertain, and their motions a little mysterious. Before this letter is sealed, which will 
not be till Sunday next, I hope I shall be able to in form you better. 
</p><p>
I rejoice at your fine season and at my brother Cranch's attention to husbandry. I am very glad he bought the farm and that he likes it so well. I pant 
for domestic life and rural felicity like his. I am better than I have been. But I dread the heats which 
are coming on. This day completes six months since I left you. I am wasted and exhausted in mind and body, with incessant applications to business, but if I 
can possibly endure it, will hold out the year. It is nonsense to dance backwards and forwards. After this year, I shall take my leave. 
</p><p>
Our affairs are in a fine prosperous train, and if they continue so, I can leave this station with honor. Next month completes three years that I have been 
devoted to the service of liberty. A slavery it has been to me, whatever the world may think of it. To a man whose attachments to his family are as strong 
as mine, absence alone from such a wife and such children would be a great sacrifice. But in addition to 
this separation what have I not done ? What have I not suffered ? What have I not hazarded ? These are questions that I may ask you, but I will ask such questions of none else. Let the cymbals of popularity 
tinkle still. Let the butterflies of fame glitter with their wings. I shall envy neither their music nor their 
colors. The loss of property affects me little. All other hard things I despise, but the loss of your company and that of my dear babes for so long a time, I consider as a loss of so much solid happiness. The tender social feelings of my heart which have distressed me beyond all utterance in my most busy aclive scenes as well as in the numerous hours of melancholy solitude, are known only to God and my ownsoul. 
</p><p>
How often have I seen my dearest friend, a widow, and her charming prattlers, orphans exposed to all 
the insolence of unfeeling, impious tyrants ! Yet I can appeal to my final Judge, the horrid vision has never for one moment shaken the resolution of my heart.
