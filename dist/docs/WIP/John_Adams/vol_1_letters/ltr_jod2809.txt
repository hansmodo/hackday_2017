</p><p>
HAVING a leisure moment, while the Congress is assembling, I gladly embrace it to write you a line. 
When the Congress first met, Mr. Gushing made a motion that it should be opened with prayer. It was 
opposed by Mr. Jay of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and Mr. Rutledge of South Carolina, because we were so divided in religious sentiments ; some Episcopalians, some 
Quakers, some Anabaptists, some Presbyterians, and some Congregationalists, that we could not join in the 
same act of worship. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=sam" rel="met colleague">Mr. Samuel Adams</a> arose and said, he was no bigot, and could hear a prayer 
from a gentleman of piety and virtue, who was at the same time a friend to his country. He was a 
stranger in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, but had heard that Mr. Duche " (Dushay they pronounce it) " deserved that 
character, and therefore he moved, that Mr. Duche, an episcopal clergyman, might be desired to read prayers to the Congress tomorrow morning." The 
motion was seconded and passed in the affirmative. Mr. Randolph, our President, waited on Mr. Duche and received for answer that, if his health would 
permit, he certainly would. Accordingly, next morning he appeared with his clerk and in his pontificals, 
and read several prayers in the established form, and then read the collect for the seventh day of September, which was the thirty-fifth Psalm. You must remember, this was the next morning after we heard 
the horrible rumor of the cannonade of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. 
I never saw a greater effect upon an audience. It seemed as if Heaven had ordained that Psalm to be read on that morning. 
</p><p>
After this, Mr. Duche, unexpectedly to every body, struck out into an extemporary prayer, which filled the 
bosom of every man present. I must confess, I never heard a better prayer, or one so well pronounced. Episcopalian as he is, Dr. Cooper himself 
never prayed with such fervor, such ardor, such earnestness and pathos, and in language so elegant 
and sublime, for America, for the Congress, for the province of Massachusetts Bay, and especially the 
town of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. It has had an excellent effect upon 
every body here. I must beg you to read that Psalm. If there was any faith in the sortes Yirgilianse, or sortes Homericae, or especially the sortes Biblicse, it would be thought providential. 
</p><p>
It will amuse your friends to read this letter and the 35th Psalm to them. Read it to your father and Mr. Wibird. I wonder what our <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a> church 
men would think of this. Mr. Duche is one of the most ingenious men, and best characters, and greatest orators in the episcopal order upon this continent ; 
yet a zealous friend of liberty and his country. 
</p><p>
I long to see my dear family God bless, preserve, and prosper it. 
</p><p>
Adieu.
