THERE is too much ice in Hudson's river to cross it 
in ferry boats, and too little to cross it without, in 
most places, which has given us the trouble of riding 
up the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a> road, as far as this place, where we 
expect to go over on the ice, but if we should be dis 
appointed here, we must go up as far as Esopus, 
about fifteen miles further.

This, as well as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fishkill" rel="city">Fishkill</a>, is a pretty village. We 
are almost wholly among the Dutch. Zealous against 
the Tories, who have not half the tranquillity here, 
that they have in the town of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, after all the 
noise that has been made about <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> Tories. 
We are treated with the utmost respect, wherever 
we go, and have met with nothing like an insult from 
any person whatever. I heard ten reflections, and 
twenty sighs and groans, among my constituents, to 
one here. 
</p><p>
I shall never have done hoping that my country 
men will contrive some coup dt main for the wretches 
at Newport. The winter is the time. Our enemies 
have divided their force. Let us take advantage of it
