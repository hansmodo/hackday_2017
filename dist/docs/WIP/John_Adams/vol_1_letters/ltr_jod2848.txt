You justly complain of my short letters, but the critical state of things and the multiplicity of avocations 
must plead my excuse. You ask where the fleet is? The enclosed papers will inform you. You ask, what sort of defence Virginia can make ?* I believe they will make an able defence. Their militia and minute 
men have been some time employed in training themselves, and they have nine battalions of regulars, as 
they call them, maintained among them, under good officers, at the continental expense. They have set up a 
number of manufactories of fire-arms, which are busily employed. They are tolerably supplied with 
powder, and are successful and assiduous in making 
saltpetre. Their neighbouring sister, or rather daughter colony of North Carolina, which is a warlike 
colony, and has several battalions at the continental expense, as well as a pretty good militia, are ready to 
assist them, and they are in very good spirits and seem determined to make a brave resistance. The 
gentry are very rich, and the common people very 
poor. This inequality of property gives an aristocratical turn to all their proceedings, and occasions a 
strong aversion in their patricians, to Common Sense. I But the spirit of these Barons is coming 
down and it must submit. It is very true, as you observe, they have been duped by Dunmore. But 
this is a common case. All the colonies are duped, more or less, at one time and another. A more egregious bubble was never blown up, than the story of 
Commissioners coming to treat with the Congress, yet it has gained credit like a charm, not only with, but against, the clearest evidence. I never shall forget 
the delusion which seized 6ur best and most sagacious friends, the dear inhabitants of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, the winter be 
fore last. Credulity and the want of foresight are 
imperfections in the human character, that no politician can sufficiently guard against.

You give me some pleasure by your account of a certain house in Queen street. I had burned it long 
ago in imagination. It rises now to my view like a phoenix. What shall I say of the Solicitor General ? 
I pity his pretty children. I pity his father and his sisters. I wish I could be clear that it is no moral 
evil to pity him and his lady. Upon repentance, they will certainly have a large share in the compassions of 
many. But let us take warning, and give it to our children. Whenever vanity and gaiety, a love of pomp and dress, furniture, equipage, buildings, great 
company, expensive diversions and elegant entertainments get the better of the principles and judgments of men or women, there is no knowing where they 
will stop, nor into what evils, natural, moral or political they will lead us. Your description o/ your own gaiete de cccur charms me. Thanks be to God, you 
have just cause to rejoice ; and may the bright prospect be obscured by no cloud. As to declarations of 
independency, be patient Read our privateering laws and our commercial laws. What signifies a word? 
</p><p>
As to your extraordinary code of laws, I cannot but laugh. We have been told that our struggle has loosened the bonds of government every where ; thai-children and apprentices were disobedient; that 
schools and colleges were grown turbulent ; that Indians slighted their guardians, and negroes grew insolent to their masters. But your letter I was the first intimation that another tribe, more numerous and powerful than all the rest, were grown discontented. This is rather too coarse a compliment, but you are so 
saucy, I won t blot it out. Depend upon it, we know better than to repeal our masculine systems. Although they are in full force, you know they are little more than theory. We dare not exert our power 
in its full latitude. We are obliged to go fair and softly, and, in practice, you know we are the subjects. 
We have only the name of masters, and rather than give up this, which would completely subject us to 
the despotism of the petticoat, I hope, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a>, and all our brave heroes would fight ; I am 
sure, every good politician would plot, as long as he would against despotism, empire, monarchy, aristocracy, oligarchy or ochlocracy. A fine story indeed ! 
I begin to think the ministry as deep as they are wicked. After stirring up tories, land-jobbers, trimmers, bigots, Canadians, Indians, Negroes, Hanoverians, Hessians, Russians, Irish Roman Catholics, 
Scotch renegadoes, at last, they have stimulated the to demand new privileges and threaten to rebel. 
</p><p>
be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors 
were. Do not put such an unlimited power into the hands of 
the husbands. Remember, all men would be tyrants, if they 
could. If particular care and attention are not paid to the 
ladies, WP are determined to foment a rebellion, and will not 
hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation."
