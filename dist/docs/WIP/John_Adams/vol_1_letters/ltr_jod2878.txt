THIS day, I think, has been the most remarkable of all. Sullivan came here from Lord Howe, five days 
ago,with a message, that his lordship desired a half an 
hour's conversation with some of the members of Congress in their private capacities. We have spent three 
or four days in debating, whether we should take 
any notice of it. I have, to the utmost of my abilities, during the whole time, opposed our taking any 
notice of it. But, at last, it was determined by a majority, " that the Congress being the representatives 
of the free and independent States of America, it was 
improper to appoint any of their members to confer 
in their private characters with his lordship. But 
they would appoint a committee of their body, to 
wait on him, to know whether he had power to treat 
with Congress upon terms of peace, and to hear any 
propositions that his lordship may think proper to 
make." 
</p><p>
When the committee came to be balloted for, Dr. 
Franklin and your humble servant were unanimously 
chosen. Colonel R. H. Lee and Mr. Rutledge had 
an equal number ; but, upon a second vote, Mr. Rut- 
ledge was chosen. I requested to be excused, but 
was desired to consider of it until to-morrow. My 
friends here advise me to go. All the stanch and intrepid are very earnest with me to go, and the timid 
and wavering, if any such there are, agree in the re 
quest So I believe I shall undertake the journey. I 
doubt whether his lordship will see us, hut the same 
committee will be directed to inquire into the state of 
the army at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, so that there will be business 
enough, if his lordship makes none. It would fill this 
letter-book to give you all the arguments, for and 
against this measure, if I had liberty to attempt it. 
His lordship seems to have been playing off a number 
of Machiavelian manoeuvres, in order to throw upon 
us the odium of continuing this war. Those who 
have been advocates for the appointment of this committee are for opposing manoeuvre to manoeuvre, and 
are confident that the consequence will be, that the 
odium will fall upon him. However this may be, my 
lesson is plain, to ask a few questions and take his answers. 
</p><p>
I can think of but one reason for their putting me 
upon this embassy, and that is this. An idea has 
crept into many minds here, that his lordship is such 
another as Mr. Hutchinson, and they may possibly 
think that a man who has been accustomed to penetrate into the mazy windings of Hutchinson's heart, 
and the serpentine wiles of his head, may be tolerably qualified to converse with his lordship.

Yesterday's post brought me yours of August 29. 
The report you mention " that I was poisoned upon my return home, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>," I suppose will be 
thought to be a prophecy delivered by the oracle, in mystic language, and meant, that I should be politically or morally poisoned by Lord Howe. But the prophecy shall be false.
