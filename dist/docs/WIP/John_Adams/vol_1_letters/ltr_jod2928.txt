MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I THINK I have sometimes observed to you in conversation, that upon examining the biography of illustrious men, you will generally find some female about 
them, in the relation of mother, or wife, or sister, to whose instigation a great part of their merit is to be 
ascribed. You will find a curious example of this in the case of Aspasia, the wife of Pericles. She was a 
woman of the greatest beauty and the first genius. She taught him, it is said, his refined maxims of policy, his lofty imperial eloquence, nay, even composed the speeches on which so great a share of his reputation was founded. The best men in Athens frequented her house and brought their wives to receive lessons from her of economy and right deportment. 
Socrates himself was her pupil in eloquence, and gives her the honor of that funeral oration, which he delivers in the Menexenus of Plato. Aristophanes, in deed, abuses this famous lady, but Socrates does her honor. 
</p><p>
I wish some of our great men had such wives. By the account in your last letter, it seems the women in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> begin to think themselves able to serve their country. What a pity it is, that our generals in the northern districts had not Aspasias to their wives ! 
</p><p>
I believe the two Howes have not very great women for wives. If they had, we should suffer more from their exertions than we do. This is our good 
fortune. A woman of good sense would not let her husband spend five weeks at sea in such a season of 
the year. A smart wife would have put Howe in possession of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, a long time ago.
