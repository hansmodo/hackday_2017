MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
I HAVE this morning been out of town, to accompany 
our Generals, Washington, Lee and Schuyler, a little 
way on their journey to the American camp, before 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. The three Generals were all mounted on 
horse-back, accompanied by Major Milliin, who is 
gone in the character of Aid-de-camp. All the 
delegates from the Massachusetts^ with their servants 
and carriages, attended. Many others of the delegates 
from the Congress ; a large troop of light horse in 
their uniforms ; many officers of militia, besides, in 
their's ; music playing, &c. &c. Such is the pride and 
pomp of war. I, poor creature, worn out with scribbling for my bread and my liberty, low in spirits and 
weak in health, must leave others to wear the laurels 
which I have sown ; others to eat the bread which I have earned ; a common case. 
</p><p>
We had, yesterday, by the way of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and 
New London, a report which distresses us almost as 
much as that we had last fall, of the cannonade of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. A battle at Bunker's hill, and Dorchester 
point Three Colonels wounded, Gardner mortally. 
We wait to hear more particulars. Our hopes and 
fears are, alternately, very strong. If there is any 
truth in this account, you must be in great confusion. 
God Almighty's providence preserve, sustain, and comfort you.

27 June.

This moment received two letters from you. 
Courage, my dear. We shall be supported in life 
or comforted in death. I rejoice that my country 
men behaved so bravely, though not so skilfully con 
ducted as I could wish. I hope this defect will be 
remedied by the new modelling of the army. 
My love every where.
