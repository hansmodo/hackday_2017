MY DEAR,
</p><p>
This letter is intended to go by my friend Mr. William Barrell, whom I believe you have seen in Boston. If he calls at our house you will please to receive him complaisantly, and thank him for your 
present of pins. I have been treated by him with great civility, both at this, and the former Congress.

This day I have heard my parish priest, Mr. Duffield, This gentleman never 
fails to adapt his discourse to the times. He pressed 
upon his audience the necessity of piety and virtue 
in the present times of adversity, and held up to their 
view the army before <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, as an example. He 
understood, he said, that the voice of the swearer was 
scarcely heard ; that the Sabbath was well observed, 
and all immoralities discountenanced. No doubt there 
were vicious individuals, but the general character 
was good. I hope this good man's information 
is true, and that this will become more and more the 
true character of that camp. You may well suppose 
that this language was exceedingly pleasing to me.

We have nothing new, but the arrival of some powder. Three little vessels have certainly arrived, making about ten tons in the whole, and four or five tons 
have arrived from South Carolina. A supply, I think 
now we shall certainly obtain. Congress have taken measures for this end, which I hope to hare the pleasure of explaining to you, in person, within a few days, 
as Congress have determined to adjourn to some time I in September. I could not vote for this myself, be 
cause I thought it might be necessary to keep together ; but I could not blame those who did, for really 
we have been all so assiduous in business, in this exhausting, debilitating climate, that our lives are more 
exposed than they would be in camp. Love to the children.
