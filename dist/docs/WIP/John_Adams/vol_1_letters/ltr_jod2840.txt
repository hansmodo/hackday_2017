MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
I AM determined not to commit a fault, which escaped me the last time I set out for the southward. I waited on General Thomas at Roxbury, this morning, and 
then went to Cambridge, where I dined at Colonel Mifllin's with the General and lady, and a vast collection of other company, among whom were six or seven 
sachems and warriors of the French Caghnawaga Indians with several of their wives and children. A 
savage feast they made of it, yet were very polite in 
the Indian style. One of these sachems is an Englishman, a native of this colony, whose name was Williams, captivated in infancy with his mother, and 
adopted by some kind squaw ; another, I think, is half French blood. 
</p><p>
I was introduced to them by the General, as one of 
the grand council fire at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, which made 
them prick up their ears. They came and shook 
hands with me, and made me low bows and scrapes, 
&c. In short, I was much pleased with this day's entertainment. 
</p><p>
The General is to make them presents in clothes 
and trinkets. They have visited the lines at Cambridge, and are going to see those at Roxbury. 
</p><p>
To-morrow we mount for the grand council fire, where I shall think often of my little brood at the 
foot of Pcnn's hill. Remember me particularly to each of the children. Tell them I charge them to be 
good, honest, active and industrious, for their own sakes as well as ours. 
</p>
