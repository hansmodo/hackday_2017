MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
SITTING down to write you is a scene almost too tender for my state of nerves. 
</p><p>
It calls up to my view the anxious, distressed state you must be in, amidst the confusion and dangers which surround you. I long to return and 
</p><p>
Without signature, which is often the case. administer all the consolation in my power, but when 
I shall have accomplished all the business I have to do here, I know not, and if it should be necessary to stay here till Christmas, or longer, in order 
to effect our purposes, I am determined patiently to wait 
</p><p>
Patience, forbearance, long suffering are the lessons taught here for our province, and at the same 
time, absolute and open resistance to the new Government. I wish I could convince gentlemen of the 
danger, or impracticability of this as fully as I believe it myself. The art and address of ambassadors 
from a dozen belligerent powers of Europe ; nay, of a conclave of cardinals at the election of a pope ; 
or of the princes in Germany at the choice of an Emperor, would not exceed the specimens we have 
seen ; yet the Congress all profess the same political principles. They all profess to consider our province, 
as suffering in the common cause, and indeed they seem to feel for us, as if for themselves. We have 
had as great questions to discuss as ever engaged the attention of men, and an infinite multitude of them. 
</p><p>
I received a very kind letter from Deacon Palmer, acquainting me with Mr. Cranch's designs of removing to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>, which I approve very much, and 
wish I had a house for every family in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, and 
abilities to provide for them in the country. I submit it to you, my dear, whether it would not be best 
to remove all the books, and papers, and furniture in 
the Office at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> up to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>. There will be no business there, nor any where, I suppose, and my young friends can study there better than in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> at present. 
</p><p>
I shall be killed with kindness in this place. We go to Congress at nine, and there we stay, most earnestly engaged in debates upon the most abstruse 
mysteries of state, until three in the afternoon ; then we adjourn, and go to dine with some of the nobles of Pennsylvania at four o clock, and feast upon ten 
thousand delicacies, and sit drinking Madeira, Claret and Burgundy till six or seven, and then go home 
fatigued to death with business, company, and care. Yet I hold it out surprisingly. 
</p><p>
Yours, most affectionately, 
</p><p>
