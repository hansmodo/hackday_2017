I SUPPOSE your ladyship has been in the twitters for 
some time, because you have not received a letter by 
every post, as you used to do. But I am coming to 
make my apology in person. I yesterday, asked and 
obtained leave of absence. It will take me till next 
Monday to get ready, to finish off a few remnants of 
public business, and to put my private affairs in proper 
order. On the 14th day of October I shall get away, 
perhaps. But I Don't expect to reach home in less 
than a fortnight, perhaps not in three weeks, as I 
shall be obliged to make stops by the way.
