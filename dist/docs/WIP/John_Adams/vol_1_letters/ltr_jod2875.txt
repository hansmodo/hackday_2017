</p><p>
YESTERDAY morning, I took a walk into Arch street 
to see Mr. Peale's Painter's room. Peale is from Maryland, a tender, soft, affectionate creature. He 
showed me a large picture, containing a group of figures, which, upon inquiry, I found were his family ; 
his mother and his wife's mother, himself and his wife, 
his brothers and sisters, and his children, sons and 
daughters, all young. There was a pleasant, a happy cheerfulness in their countenances, and a familiarity in their air towards each other. 
</p><p>
He showed me one moving picture. His wife, all 
bathed in tears, with a child about six months old, laid 
out upon her lap. This picture struck me prodigiously. 
He has a variety of portraits, very well done, but not 
so well as Copley's portraits. Copley is the greatest master that ever was in America. His portraits 
far exceed West's. Peale has taken <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="met colleague">Dr. Franklin</a>, Mrs. Washington, Mrs. Rush, 
Mrs. Hopkinson, Mr. Blair McClenachan and his little daughter in one picture, his lady and her little son 
in another. Peale showed me some books upon the 
art of painting. Among the rest one by Sir Joshua 
Reynolds, the President of the English Academy of 
painters, by whom the pictures of General Conway 
and Colonel Barre, in Faneuil Hall, were taken. He 
showed me too, a great number of miniature pictures. 
Among the rest, Mr. Hancock and his lady, Mr. Smith 
of South Carolina, whom you saw the other day in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, Mr. Custis, and many others. 
</p><p>
He showed me, likewise, draughts, or rather 
sketches, of gentlemen's seats in Virginia, where he 
had been, Mr. Corbin's, Mr. Page's, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a>'s, &c. Also a variety of rough drawings made 
by great masters in Italy, which he keeps as models. 
He showed me several imitations of heads, which he 
had made in clay, as large as the life, with his hands 
only. Among the rest, one of his own head and face, 
which was a great likeness. He is ingenious. He 
has vanity, loves finery, wears a sword, gold lace, 
speaks French, is capable of friendship, and strong 
family attachments, and natural affections. 
</p><p>
At this shop, I met Mr. Francis Hopkinson, late a Mandamus Counsellor of New Jersey, now a member 
of the continental Congress, who, it seems, is a native of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, a son of a prothonotary of this county, who was a person much respected. The son was 
liberally educated, and is a painter and a poet. I 
have a curiosity to penetrate a little deeper into the 
bosom of this curious gentleman, and may possibly 
give you some more particulars concerning him. He 
is one of your pretty, little, curious, ingenious men. 
His head is not bigger than a large apple, less than 
our friend Pemberton, or Doctor Simon Tufts. I 
have not met with anything in natural history more 
amusing and entertaining than his personal appearance yet he is genteel and well bred and is very social. 
</p><p>
I wish I had leisure and tranquillity of mind to 
amuse myself with those elegant, and ingenious arts of 
painting, sculpture, statuary, architecture and music. 
But I have not. A taste in all of them is an agreeable accomplishment. Mr. Hopkinson has taken in 
crayons with his own hand a picture of Miss Keys, a famous New Jersey beauty. He talks of bringing it to town, and in that case, I shall see it, I hope.
