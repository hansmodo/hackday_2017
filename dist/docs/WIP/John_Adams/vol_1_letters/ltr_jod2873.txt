THIS is the anniversary of a memorable day in the 
history of America. A day when the principle of 
American resistance and independence was first asserted and carried into action. The stamp office fell 
before the rising spirit of our countrymen. It is not 
impossible that the two grateful brothers may make 
their grand attack this very day. If they should, it is 
possible it may be more glorious for this country, than 
ever: it is certain, it will become more memorable. 
Your favors of August 1st and 5th came by yesterday's post. I congratulate you all upon your agreeable prospects. Even my pathetic little hero Charles, 
I hope, will have the distemper finely. It is very odd 
that the Doctor cannot put infection enough into his 
veins ; nay, it is unaccountable to me, that he has not 
taken it the natural way, before now. I am under 
little apprehension, prepared as he is, if he should. 
I am concerned about you, much more. So many 
persons about you sick, the children troublesome, your 
mind perplexed, yourself weak and relaxed. The 
situation must be disagreeable. The country air and 
exercise, however, will refresh you.

I am put upon a committee, to prepare a device for 
a golden medal, to commemorate the surrender of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> to the American arms, and upon another, to 
prepare devices for a great seal, for the confederated 
States. There is a gentleman here of French extraction, whose name is Du Simitiere, a painter by profession, whose designs are very ingenious, and his 
drawings well executed. lie has been applied to for 
his advice. I waited on him yesterday, and saw his 
sketches. For the medal he proposes, Liberty, with 
her spear and pileus, leaning on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a>. 
The British fleet in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> harbor with all their sterns 
towards the town, the American troops marching in. 
For the seal, he proposes, The arms of the several nations from whence America has been peopled, r.s 
English, Scotch, Irish, Dutch, German, &c., each in a 
shield. On one side of them, Liberty with her pileus, 
on the other, a rifler in his uniform, with his rifle gun 
in one hand, and his tomahawk in the other. This 
dress and these troops with this kind of armor being 
peculiar to America, unless the dress was known to 
the Romans. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="met colleague">Dr. Franklin</a> showed me yesterday a 
book, containing an account of the dresses of all the 
Roman soldiers, one of which appeared exactly like 
it. This M. du Simitiere is a very curious man. He 
has begun a collection of materials for a history of 
this revolution. He begins with the first advices of 
the tea ships. He cuts out of the newspapers every 
scrap of intelligence, and every piece of speculation, 
and pastes it upon clean paper, arranging them under 
the head of that State to which they belong, and intends to bind them up in volumes. He has a list of 
every speculation and pamphlet concerning independence, and another of those concerning forms of government

Doctor F. proposes a device for a seal. Moses lifting up his wand, and dividing the red sea, and 
Pharaoh in his chariot overwhelmed with the waters. This motto. "Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God." 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="met colleague">Mr. Jefferson</a> proposed, The children of Israel in the wilderness, led by a cloud by day, and a pillar of 
fire by night and on the other side, Hengist and Horsa, the Saxon chiefs, from whom we claim the 
honor of being descended, and whose political principles and form of government we have assumed.

I proposed, The choice of Hercules, as engraved by Gribelin, in some editions of Lord ShaAesbury's works. 
The hero resting on his club. Virtue pointing to her rugged mountain on one hand, and persuading him to 
ascend. Sloth, glancing at her flowery paths of pleasure, wantonly reclining on the ground, displaying 
the charms both of her eloquence and person, to seduce him into vice. But this is too complicated a group for a seal or medal, and it is not original. 
</p><p>
I shall conclude by repeating my request for horses and a servant. Let the horses be good ones. I 
can't ride a bad horse so many hundred miles. If our affairs had not been in so critical a state at New 
York, I should have run away before now. But I am determined, now, to stay until some gentleman is sent 
here in my room, and until my horses come. But the time will be very tedious.

The whole force is arrived at Staten Island.
