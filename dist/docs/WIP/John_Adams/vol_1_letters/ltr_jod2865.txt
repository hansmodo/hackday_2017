You seem to be situated in the place of greatest 
tranquillity and security of any upon the continent 
I may be mistaken in this particular, and an armament may have invaded your neighborhood, before now. But we have no intelligence of any such 
design, and all that we now know of the motions, 
plans, operations and designs of the enemy, indicates 
the contrary. It is but just that you should have a 
little rest, and take a little breath. 
</p><p>
I wish I knew whether your brother and mine have 
enlisted in the army, and what spirit is manifested by 
our militia for marching to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and Crown 
point. The militia of Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the lower counties are marching with 
much alacrity, and a laudable zeal to take care of 
Howe and his army at Staten Island. The army in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> is in high spirits, and seems determined to give the enemy a serious reception. The 
unprincipled and unfeeling and unnatural inhabitants 
of Staten Island are cordially receiving the enemy, 
and, deserters say, have engaged to take arms. 
They are an ignorant, cowardly pack of scoundrels. 
Their numbers are small, and their spirit less.

It is sometime since I received any letter from you. 
The Plymouth one was the last. You must write 
me, every week, by the post, if it is but a few lines. 
It gives me many spirits. I design to write to the 
General Court requesting a dismission, or at least, 
a furlough. I think to propose that they choose four 
more members, or, at least, three more, that so, we 
may attend here in rotation. Two or three or four 
may be at home at a time, and the Colony properly 
represented notwithstanding. Indeed, while the Congress were employed in political regulations, forming 
the sentiments of the people of the Colonies into some consistent system, extinguishing the remainders 
of authority under the crown, and gradually erecting 
and strengthening governments .under the authority 
of the people, turning their thoughts upon the principles of polity and the forms of government, framing 
constitutions for the Colonies separately, and a limited 
and a defined Confederacy for the United Colonies, 
and in some other measures, which I do not choose 
to mention particularly, but which are now determined, or near the point of determination, I flattered 
myself that I might have been of some little use 
here. But now, these matters will be soon completed, and very little business will be to be done here, 
but what will be either military or commercial; 
branches of knowledge and business for which 
hundreds of others in our province are much better 
qualified than I am. I shall therefore request my masters to relieve me. 
</p><p>
I am not a little concerned about my health, which 
seems to have been providentially preserved to me, 
much beyond my expectations. But I begin to feel 
the disagreeable effects of unremitting attention to 
business for so long a time, and a want of exercise, 
and the bracing quality of my native air ; so that I 
have the utmost reason to fear an irreparable injury 
to my constitution, if I do not obtain a little relaxation. The fatigues of war are much less destructive 
to health, than the painful, laborious attention to 
debates, and to writing, which drinks up the spirits and consumes the strength. 
</p><p>
I am, &c.
