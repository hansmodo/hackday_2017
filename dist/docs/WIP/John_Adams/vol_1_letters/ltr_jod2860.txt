YOUR favor I of 17 June, dated at Plymouth, was 
handed me by yesterday's post. I was much pleased 
to find that you had taken a journey to Plymouth, to see your friends, in the long absence of one, whom you may wish to see. The excursion will be an amusement, and will serve your health. How happy would it have made me to have taken this journey with you ! 
</p><p>
I was informed, a day or two before the receipt of 
your letter, that you was gone to Plymouth, by Mrs. 
Polly Palmer, who was obliging enough, in your absence, to send me the particulars of the expedition 
to the lower harbor against the men of war. Her narration is executed with a precision and perspicuity, 
which would have become the pen of an accomplished historian.

I am very glad you had so good an opportunity of seeing one of our little American men of war. 
Many ideas new to you must have presented them selves in such a scene ; and you will in future better I understand the relations of sea engagements.

I rejoice extremely at Dr. Bulfincirs petition to 
open a Hospital. But I hope the business will be done upon a larger scale. I hope that one Hospital 
will be licensed in every county, if not in every town. 
I am happy to find you resolved to be with the children in the first class. Mr. Whitney and Mrs. Katy 
Quincy are cleverly through inoculation in this city. 
The information you give me, of our friend's re 
fusing his appointment, has given me much pain, grief 
and anxiety. I believe I shall be obliged to follow 
his example. I have not fortune enough to support 
my family, and, what is of more importance, to sup 
port the dignity of that exalted station. It is too high 
and lifted up for me, who delight in nothing so much as retreat, solitude, silence and obscurity. In private life, no one has a right to censure me for following 
my own inclinations in retirement, simplicity and frugality. In public life, every man has a right to re 
mark as he pleases. At least he thinks so. Yesterday, the greatest question was decided, which 
ever was debated in America, and a greater, perhaps, 
never was nor will be decided among men. A Resolution was passed without one dissenting Colony 
" that these United Colonies are, and of right ought 
to be, free and independent States, and as such they 
have, and of right ought to have, full power to make 
war, conclude peace, establish commerce and to do 
all other acts and things which other States may right 
fully do." You will see, in a few days, a Declaration setting forth the causes which have impelled us 
to this mighty revolution, and the reasons which will 
justify it in the sight of God and man. A plan of confederation will be taken up in a few days.

When I look back to the year 1761 and recollect 
the argument concerning writs of assistance in the 
superior court, which I have hitherto considered as 
the commencement of this controversy between Great 
Britain and America, and run through the whole 
period, from that time to this, and recollect the series 
of political events, the chain of causes and effects, I 
am surprised at the suddenness, as well as greatness 
of this revolution. Britain has been filled with folly, 
and America with wisdom; at least, this is my judgment. Time must determine. It is the will of Heaven that the two countries should be sundered forever. 
It may be the will of Heaven that America shall suffer calamities still more wasting, arid distresses yet 
more dreadful. If this is to be the case, it will have 
this good effect at least. It will inspire us with many 
virtues, which we have not, and correct many errors, 
follies and vices which threaten to disturb, dishonor, 
and destroy us. The furnace of affliction produces 
refinement in states as well as individuals. And the 
new Governments we are assuming in every part 
will require a purification from our vices, and an 
augmentation of our virtues, or they will be no blessings. The people ^ilLJwwe unbounded power, and 
the pe^pTe r ~5Te""extrernely addicted to corruption and venality, as well as the great. But I must submit 
all my hopes and fears to an overruling providence, in which, unfashionable as the faith may be, I firmly believe.
