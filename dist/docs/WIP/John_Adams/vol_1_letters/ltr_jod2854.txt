I HAVE this morning heard Mr. Duffield, upon the signs 
of the times. He ran a parallel between the case of 
Israel, and that of America ; and between the con 
duct of Pharaoh, and that of George. Jealousy that 
the Israelites would throw off the government of 
Egypt made him issue his edict, that the midwives 
should cast the children into the river, and the other 
edict, that the men should make a large revenue of 
bricks without straw. He concluded, that the course 
of events indicated strongly the design of Providence, -* 
that we should be separated from Great Britain, &c. 
Is it not a saying of Moses, " who am I, that I 
should go in and out before this great people ? " 
When I consider the great events which are passed, 
and those greater which ore rapidly advancing, and 
that I may have been instrumental in touching some 
springs, and turning some small wheels, which have 
had and will have such effects, I feel an awe upon my 
mind, which is not easily described. Great Britain 
has at last driven America to the last step, a complete separation from her; a total absolute independence, not only of her Parliament, but of her crown, 
for such is the amount of the resolve of the 15th. Confederation among ourselves, or alliances with foreign 
nations are not necessary to a perfect separation from 
Britain. That is effected by extinguishing all authority under the crown, Parliament, and nation, as the 
resolution for instituting governments has done, to all 
intents and purposes. Confederation will be necessary 
for our internal concord, and alliances may be so for your external defence.

I have reasons to believe that no colony, which shall assume a government under the people, will give it 
up. There is something very unnatural and odious in a government a thousand leagues off. A whole government of our own choice, managed by persons whom 
we love, revere, and can confide in, has charms in it, for which men will fight Two young gentlemen 
from South Carolina in this city, who were in Charlestown when their new constitution was promulgated, 
and when their new Governor and Council and Assembly walked out in procession, attended by the guards, 
company of cadets, light horse, &c., told me, that they were beheld by the people with transports and 
tears of joy. The people gazed at them with a kind of rapture. They both told me, that the reflection, 
that these were gentlemen whom they all loved, esteemed and revered, gentlemen of their own choice, 
whom they could trust, and whom they could displace, if any of them should behave amiss, affected them 
so, that they could not help crying... They say, their people will never give up this government. One of 
these gentlemen is a relation of yours, a Mr. Smith, son of Mr. Thomas Smith. I shall give him this letter or another to you.

A privateer fitted out here by Colonel Roberdeau and Major Bayard since our resolves for privateering, 
I am this moment informed, has taken a valuable prize. This is encouragement at the beginning.

In one or two of your letters, you remind me to think of you as I ought. Bo assured, there is not an 
hour of the day, in which I Don't think of you as I ought, that is, with every sentiment of tenderness, esteem and admiration.
