MY barber just left the chamber. The following curious dialogue was the amusement during the gay moments of shaving. 
</p><p>
" Well, Burne, what is the lie of the day ? " " Sir, Mr told me, that a privateer from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> has 
taken two valuable prizes with sixteen guns each. I 
can scarcely believe it." " Have you heard of the 
success of the Rattlesnake, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, and the 
Sturdy Begqar, of Maryland, Mr. Burne ? These two 
privateers have taken eleven prizes, and sent them 
into the West India Islands ; nine transports and two 
guinea men." "Confound the ill luck, Sir; I was 
going to sea myself on board the Rattlesnake, and 
my wife fell a yelping. These wives are queer 
things. I told her, I wondered she had no more 
ambition." " Now," says I, " when you walk the 
streets and any body asks who that is ? The answer is 
" Burne the barber's wi/e," Should you not be better 
pleased to hear it said, " That is Captain Burners la 
dy" the captain of marines on board the Rattlesnake ? " 
" O," says she, * I would rather be called Burne the 
barber's wife, than Captain Burners widow. I Don't 
desire to live better than you maintain me, my dear." 
So it is, Sir, by this sweet, honey language, I am 
choused out of my prizes, and must go on *ith my 
soap and razors and pincers and combs. I wish she 
had my ambition.

If this letter should be intercepted by the Tories, 
they will get a booty. Let them enjoy it If some 
of their wives had been as tender and discreet as the 
barber's, their husbands ambition would not have led 
them into so many salt ponds. What an ignis fatuus 
this ambition is ? How few of either sex have arrived 
at Mrs. Burne's pitch of moderation, and are able to 
say, " I Don't desire to live better, and had rather be 
the Barber's wife, than the Captain's widow " ! Quite 
smart, I think, as well as philosophical.
