THIS day has been observed in this place with exemplary decency and solemnity, in consequence of an 
appointment of the government, in observance of a 
recommendation of Congress, as a day of fasting. I 
went to the Presbyterian meeting, and heard Mr. Allison deliver a most pathetic and animating as well as 
pious, patriotic, and elegant discourse. I have seldom 
been better pleased or more affected with a sermon. 
The Presbyterian meeting house in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, stands 
upon a hill just at the back of the town, from whence 
we have a very fair prospect of the town and of the 
water upon which it stands, and of the country round 
it. Behind this eminence, which is the Beacon Hill 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, lies a beautiful meadow, which is entirely encircled by a stream of water. This most 
beautiful scene must be partly natural and partly artificial. Beyond the meadow and canal, you have a 
charming view of the country. Besides the meeting 
house, there is, upon this height, a large and elegant 
Court House, as yet unfinished within, and a small 
church of England, in which an old clergyman officiates, Mr. Chase, father of Mr. Chase one of the dele 
gates of Maryland, who, they say, is not so zealous a Whig as his son.

I shall take opportunities to describe this town and 
State more particularly to you hereafter. I shall inquire into their religion, their laws, their customs, 
their manners, their descent and education, their learning, their schools and colleges, and their morals. 
It was said of Ulysses, I think, that he saw the manners of many men and many cities, which is like to 
be my case, as far as American men and cities extend, provided Congress should continue in the rolling 
humor, which I hope they will not I wish however that my mind was more at rest than it is, that I might 
be able to make more exact observation of men and things, as far as I go.

When I reflect upon the prospect before me, of so long an absence from all that I hold dear in this world, 
I mean, all that contributes to my private personal happiness, it makes me melancholy. God Almighty's providence protect and bless you, and yours and mine.
