MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
I RECEIVED your very agreeable letter by Mr. Marston, and have received two others which gave me 
much pleasure. I have written several letters, but whether they have reached you, I know not. There 
is so much rascality in the management of letters now come in fashion, that I am determined to write no 
thing of consequence, not even to the friend of my bosom, but by conveyances which I can be sure of.

The proceedings of the Congress are all a profound secret as yet, except two votes which were passed 
yesterday, and ordered to be printed. You will see them from every quarter. These votes I were passed 
in full Congress with perfect unanimity. The esteem, the affection, the admiration for the people of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> 
and the Massachusetts, which were expressed yesterday, and the fixed determination that they should 
be supported, were enough to melt a heart of stone. I saw the tears gush into the eyes of the old, grave, 
pacific Quakers of Pennsylvania. 
</p><p>
You cannot conceive, my dear, the hurry of business, visits, and ceremonies which we are obliged to go through. 
</p><p>
We have a delicate course to steer between too much activity, and too much insensibility in our critical, interested situation. I flatter myself, however, 
that we shall conduct our embassy in such a manner, 
as to merit the approbation of our country. It has 
taken us much time to get acquainted with the tempers, views, characters and designs of persons, and to 
let them into the circumstances of our province. My 
dear, do intreat every friend I have to write me. 
Every line which comes from our friends is greedily 
inquired after, and our letters have done us vast service. Middlesex and Suffolk have acquired unbounded honor here. There is no idea of submission here in anybody's head. 
</p><p>
Thank my dear Abby for her letter ; tell her it has given me great spirits. Kiss all my sweet ones for me. 
</p><p>
Adieu.
