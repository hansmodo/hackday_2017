</p><p>
I AM seated in a large library room with eight gentlemen round about me, all engaged in conversation. 
Amidst these interruptions, how shall I make it out to write a letter ? 
</p><p>
The first day of October, the day appointed by the charter of Pennsylvania for the annual election of Representatives, has passed away, and two counties 
only have chosen members, Bucks and Chester. The Assembly is therefore dead and the convention is dissolved. A new convention is to be chosen the beginning of November. The proceedings of the late convention are not well liked by the best of the Whigs. 
Their constitution is reprobated, and the oath with which they have endeavored to prop it, by obliging every man to swear that he will not add to, or diminish from, or any way alter that constitution, before he can vote, is execrated. 
</p><p>
We live in the age of political experiments. Among many that will fail, some I hope will succeed. But 
Pennsylvania will be divided and weakened, and rendered much less vigorous in the cause by the wretched ideas of government which prevail in the minds of many people in it.
