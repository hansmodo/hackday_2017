THIS has been a dull day to me. I waited the arrival 
of the post with much solicitude and impatience, but 
his arrival made me more solicitous still. " To be 
left at the Post Office," in your handwriting on the 
back of a few lines from the Doctor, was all that I 
could learn of you and my little folks. If you were 
too busy to write, I hoped that some kind hand would 
have been found to let me know something about you. 
Do my friends think that I have been a politician so 
long, as to have lost all feeling? Do they suppose I 
have forgotten my wife and^children ? Or are they 
so panic-struck with the loss of Canada, as to be 
afraid to correspond with me ? Or have they forgot 
ten that you have a husband, and your children a 
father ? What have I done, or omitted to do, that I 
should be thus forgotten and neglected in the most 
tender and affecting scene of my life ? Don't mis 
take me. I Don't blame you. Your time and thoughts 
must have been wholly taken up with your own and 
your family's situation and necessities ; but twenty 
other persons might have informed me.

I suspect that you intended to have run slily 
through the small pox with the family, without letting 
me know it, and then have sent me an account that 
you were all well. This might be a kind intention, 
and if the design had succeeded, would have made 
me very joyous. But the secret is out. and I am left 
to conjecture. But as the faculty have this distemper 
so much under command, I will flatter myself with 
the hope and expectation of soon hearing of your recovery.
