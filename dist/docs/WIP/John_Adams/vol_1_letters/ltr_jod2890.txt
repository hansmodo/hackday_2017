Tins morning, we crossed the North River, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=poughkeepsie" rel="city">Poughkeepsie</a>, on the ice, after having ridden many miles 
on the east side of it, to find a proper place. We landed at New Maryborough, and passed through that 
and Newbprough, to New Windsor, where we dined. This place is nearly opposite to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fishkill" rel="city">Fishkill</a>, and but little 
above the Highlands, where Fort Constitution and Fort Montgomery stand. The Highlands are a grand sight, a range of vast mountains which seem to be 
rolling like a tumbling sea. From New Windsor we came to this place, where we put up, and now we have a free and uninterrupted passage in a good road to Pennsylvania.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a>, with his little army, is at Morristown. Cornwallis, with his larger one, at Brunswick. Oh ! that the continental army was full. Now is the time !

My little horse holds out finely, although we have lost much time, and travelled a great deal of unnecessary way to get over the North River. We have reports of our people's taking Fort Washington again, and taking four hundred more prisoners, and six more pieces of cannon. But as I know not the persons who bring these accounts, I pay no attention to them.
