YESTERDAY was to me a lucky day, as it brought me 
two letters from you. One dated May 27, and the 
other June 3d. Don't be concerned about me, if it 
happens now and then, that you Don't hear from me 
for some weeks together. If anything should injure 
my health materially, you will soon hear of it. But 
I thank God, I am in much better health than I expected to be. But this cannot last long under the 
load that I carry. When it becomes too great for my strength, I shall ask leave to lay it down, and come home. But I will bold it out a good while yet, if I can.

I wish our uncle had as much ambition, as he has virtue and ability. A deficiency of ambition is as 
criminal and injurious as an excess of it. Tell him 
I say so. How shall we contrive to make so wise and 
good a man ambitious ? Is it not a sin lo be so modest? Ask him how he can answer it? Thanks for 
your quotation from Sully. It is extremely apropos. 
I am very glad you are so well provided with help. 
Give my respects to Mr. Belcher and his family. Tell 
him I am obliged to him for his kind care of the farm. 
I wish I could go out with him, and see the business go 
on, but I can t. Thank your father and my mother 
for their kind remembrance of me. Return my duty 
to both. Charles's young heroism charms me. Kiss 
him. Poor Mugford, I yet glorious Mugford ! How 
beautiful and sublime it is to die for one's country ! What a fragrant memory remains !

The rumor you heard of General Gates will prove 
premature. I endeavoured both here and with the 
General to have it so," and should have succeeded, if 
it had not been for the loss of General Thomas. Cruel 
small pox ! worse than the sword ! But now, I fear we must part with Gates for the &gt;.ike of Canada. Mrs. Montgomery is a lady, like all the family, of refined 
sentiments and elegant accomplishments. Her letter, as you quote it, is very pathetic. I rejoice to hear that the enemy have not fortified ; and hope they will not be suffered to attempt it.

Don t think about my clothes. I do well enough in that respect. As to your house at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, do with 
it as you please. Sell it, if you will, hut not for a farthing less than it cost me. Let it, if you please, 
but take care who your tenant is, both of his prudence to preserve the house, and his ability to pay the 
rent, I send you all the news in the papers. Great things are on the tapis. These throes will usher in the 
birth of a fine boy. We have no thoughts of removing from hence. There is no occasion for it.
