MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
THE irresistible hospitality of Dr. Sprague and his lady has prevailed upon me and my worthy fellow traveller to put up at his happy scat. We had an 
agreeable ride to this place, and to-morrow morning, 
we set off for Providence, or some other route. 
</p><p>
Present my affection in the tenderest manner to my little deserving daughter and my amiable sons. It was cruel parting this morning. My heart was most 
deeply affected although I had the presence of mind to appear composed. May God Almighty's providence protect you, my dear, and all our little ones. 
My good genius, my guardian angel, whispers me, that we shall see happier days, and that I shall live to 
enjoy the felicities of domestic life with her, whom my heart esteems above all earthly blessings.
