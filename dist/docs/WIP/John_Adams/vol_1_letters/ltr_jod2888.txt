AFTER a march like that of Hannibal over the Alps, we arrived, last night, at this place, where we found 
the utmost difficulty to get forage for our horses, and lodgings for ourselves, and, at last, were indebted to 
the hospitality of a private gentleman, Colonel Brinkhoff, who very kindly cared for us.

We came from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hartford" rel="city">Hartford</a> through Farrnington, Southington, Waterbury, Woodbury, New Milford, New Fairfield, the oblong, &c. to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fishkill" rel="city">Fishkill</a>. Of all the 
mountains I ever passed, these are the worst. We found one advantage, however, in the cheapness of 
travelling. I Don't find one half of the discontent, nor of the terror, here, that I left in the Massachusetts. People seem sanguine that they shall do some thing grand this winter.

I am well and in good spirits. My horse performs extremely well. He clambers over mountains that my old mare would have stumbled on. The weather has been dreadfully severe.
