Prefatory Note 



THE letters in these volumes are drawn from two sources. Those ad 
dressed to James or Mercy Warren are in the possession of Mr. Winslow 
Warren, a member of this Society; those written by James Warren to 
John Adams are in the Adams Papers, the trustees 1 of which courteously 
permitted them to be used. 

Material so abundant and historically rich needed no additions from 
other collections. No other single correspondence of the period offers 
such a picture of the hopes and fears of the patriot faction, or of the 
transactions in Continental Congress and in Massachusetts General 
Court, by leading participants. More than half of the letters were written 
before the peace of 1783, and for the period of war the subjects treated 
are those of greatest concern to the "rebellious" colonies and independent 
states. After 1783 the letters become less consistent but not less inti 
mate and come from a wider circle. The interest is maintained to the 
end. The series not only presents an exchange of views and a relation 
of incident in full freedom of almost family intercourse, but it adds much 
to what has been known of the motives of the conduct of public char 
acters, and the estimation in which they were held. Each writer is 
strongly individual, keenly alive to what was passing, a good reporter and 
a strong adherent to the cause of the War for Independence. 

Letters which passed between John Adams and Mercy Warren, July- 
August, 1807, on her History of the American Revolution^ were printed in 
5 Mass. Hist. Collections, iv. 315, and are not reprinted in these volumes. 
The introductory note to those letters, written by Mr. Charles Francis 
Adams, Sr., may profitably be read in this connection.

BOSTON, June the lyth, 1743. 

HONOURED SIR, I wrote to you the nth Currant, but omit 
ted Some Things which I Shall now enumerate viz. 15 Shillings 
for Printing Theses, for three Quarters shoing 24 shillings, for a 
Sett of Buckles 15 shillings, and if I make any manner of Entertain 
ment there will be a great many things to buy, tho I shall not put 
you to much Charge for that, not intending to keep much of a 
commencement and what I do will be with Russell. 1 Pray Sir send 
me money Enough for I believe I Shall not write again before com 
mencement. Your most Obedient Son, 

JAMES OTis 2 

JAMES OTIS TO MERCY WARREN 

DEAR SISTER, I received yours informing me of the death of 
sister Otis. 3 I am heartily grieved for brother and his children. 
Their loss can never be made up. I am more and more convinced 
of the vanity of things under the sun. Hope we shall all be pre 
pared for a better state. 1 can truly say I long to indulge to those 
feelings of tenderness and humanity that are proper as far as pos 
sible at all times, and never more so than in mourning with and 
comforting our friends and relations under their afflictions. But

2 Otis (1725-1783) had been prepared for college under the care of the Rev. Jonathan 
Russell, of West Barnstable, and entered at Cambridge, June, 1739. He took his degree of 
A.B. in 1743, and that of A.M. three years later.

alas, hard is my case. Dear sister, for near two years I have not 
had it in my power to spend any time for myself; it has been taken 
up for others and some of them perhaps will never thank me. The 
time however I hope is at hand when I shall be relieved from a 
task I shall never envy any man who in performing it shall pass 
the anxious wearisome days and nights which I have seen. This 
country must soon be at rest, or may be engaged in contests that 
will require neither the pen nor the tongue of a lawyer. 

The enemies of our peace entertain hopes we shall get no relief 
from home, but I am positive all appearances are against them. 
If we are to be slaves the living have only to envy the dead, for 
without liberty I own I desire not to exist here. I think I have 
written you diverse letters within the period you mention and will 
write "you many more. 

This you may depend on, no man ever loved a sister better, and 
among all my conflicts I never forget that I am endeavoring to 
serve you and yours. 

My love to my dear brother Warren. Tell him to give himself 
no concern about the scurrilous piece in Tom Fleet s paper; l it 
has served me as much as the song did last year. The Tories are 
all ashamed of this as they were of that. The author is not yet 
certainly known, tho I think I am within a week of detecting him 
for certain. If I should, shall try to cure him once for all by string 
ing him up, not bodily, but in such a way as shall gibbet his 
memory to all generations in Terrorem. It lies between Barnard, 2 
Waterhouse 3 and Jona. Sewall. 4 The first they say has not wit 

1 This refers to a long communication, without title or signature, printed in the Boston 
Evening Post, March 31, 1766. Under the name of Bluster, Otis is described, and in terms 
even more scurrilous than was usual at that time. It opens and closes with the words 
"So! Jemmy so! so! Jemmy well well," etc., which may give the clue to the "song 
of last year." For in the same paper, May 13, 1765, appeared the " Jemmibullero: a Frag 
ment of an Ode of Orpheus." One of the lines reads "and Jemmy blusters all the morn." 
See Tudor, Life of James Otis, 239. 

2 John Barnard (?), a refugee from Boston in 1776. 

3 Samuel Waterhouse, of Boston, an officer of the customs, and described by John Adams 
as "the most notorious scribbler, satirist, and libeller in the service of the conspirators 
against the liberties of America." He embarked for Halifax at the evacuation of Boston by 
the British, and was in London in November, 1776, dining with other Loyalists at the Lon 
don Coffee House, on Lord Mayor s day. In 1778 he was among those proscribed and ban 
ished by Massachusetts, and in 1779 addressed the King in a loyalist petition. Waterhouse 
was probably the writer of the article.

enough to write anything; the second swears off, and the third must 
plead guilty or not guilty so soon as I see him. I should have been 
with you before now but was concerned at the Supr. Court at 
Charlestown, not knowing but they would go on. 

Next week they sit here and must stay to know what they will 
do. Besides till matters are settled in England I dare not leave 
the Town, as men s minds are in such a situation that every nerve 
is requisite to keep things from running to some irregularity or im 
prudence, and some are yet wishing for an opportunity to hurting 
the country. I am your very affectionate Brother, 

J. OTIS 

April II, 1766. 



JOHN DICKINSON TO JAMES OTIS 1 

DEAR SIR, The Liberties of our Common Country appear to 
me to be at this moment exposd to the most imminent Danger; 
and this Apprehension has engag d me to lay my Sentiments be 
fore the Public in Letters, of which I send you a Copy. 2 

Only one has yet been published and what there Effect may be, 
cannot yet be known; but whenever the Cause of American Free 
dom is to be vindicated, I look towards the Province of Massa 
chusetts Bay. She must, as she has hitherto done, first kindle the 
Sacred Flame, that on such occasions must warm and illuminate 
the Continent. 

Words are wanting to express my sense of the Vigilance, Per 
severance, Spirit, Prudence, Resolution, and Firmness, with which 
your Colony has distinguished herself, in our unhappy Times. 
May God ever grant her noble Labors the same successful Issue, 
which was obtain d by the Repeal of the Stamp-Act. 

In my Gratitude to your Province in general, I do not forget 
the Obligations, which all Americans are under to you in particu- 

1 This and the three letters following were found among Mrs. Warren s correspondence. 
Otis and Dickinson had served together in the Stamp Act Congress of October, 1765. 

2 The first of the "Farmer s Letters" appeared in the Pennsylvania Chronicle, Decem 
ber 2, 1767, and the series continued to February 15, 1768. The first of the series, with 
some omissions, appeared in the Boston Evening Post, December 21, 1767, and the later 
letters followed in quick succession. See the "bibliographical note" in Paul L. Ford, Life 
and Writings of John Dickinson, n. 279.

lar, for the indefatigable Zeal and undaunted Courage you have 
shewn in defending their Rights. My Opinion of your Love for 
your Country induces me to commit to your hands the inclos d 
Letters, to be dispos d of as you think proper, not intending to 
give out any other Copy. I have shewn them to three Men of 
Learning here, who are my Friends. They think, with me, that the 
most destructive Consequences must follow, if these Colonies do 
not instantly, vigorously, and unanimously unite themselves, in 
the same manner they did against the Stamp Act. Perhaps they 
and I are mistaken. I therefore send the Peice containing the 
Reasons for this Opinion, to you, who I know can determine its 
True worth; and if you can discover no other merit in it, permit 
me at Least to claim the merit of having wrote it, with the most 
ardent affection for the British Colonies, the purest intentions to 
promote their Welfare, an honest Desire to assert there Rights, 
and with a deep sense of their impending Misfortunes. 

Our Cause is a cause of the highest Dignity. It is nothing Less, 
than to maintain the Liberty with which Heav n itself "hath 
made us free." I hope it will not be disgrac d in any Colony, by a 
single rash Step. We have constitutional methods of seeking 
Redress; and they are the best Methods. 

This Subject Leads me to inform you with Pleasure, because I 
think it must give you Pleasure, that the Moderation of your Con 
duct in composing the Minds of your Fellow-Citizens, has done 
you the highest Credit with us; you may be assured I feel a great 
satisfaction in hearing your praises; for ev ry Thing that advances 
your Reputation or Interest, will always afford sincere Joy, to, 
Dear Sir, your most affectionate, and most hble Servt 

JOHN DICKINSON 

PHILADELPHIA, December 5th, 1767. 

JOHN DICKINSON TO JAMES OTIS 

{January 25, 1768.] 1 

DEAR SIR, I have just received your Favor of the first of this 
Month, and am extremely happy in finding myself so much 

I The date is obtained from the endorsement. 



Warren- Adams Letters 



esteemed by you. I very sincerely return you the kind Wishes you 
make for me; and am particularly oblig d to you, for the attention 
you have been pleas d to bestow on the Papers, I ventur d to trou 
ble You with. 

I have made several alterations in the Copy, from which, that 
I sent to you, was taken: And the only correct one published here, 
is printed in the Pensylvania Gazette of Hall and Sellers. I find that 
the "Letters" publish d to the Eastward, are taken from our 
Chronicle, 1 which being incorrect, I should be glad if you would be 
so kind as to mention to any of the Printers you may happen to 
see, that the Gazette is much the most exact. 

I have great hopes from what I hear, that nothing more is want 
ing, in order to rouse our Country-men, into a proper vindication 
of their just Rights, than those Examples of public Spirit, which 
"the cold Regions of the North" have been us d to give to the 
languid Latitudes of the South. . . . 2 

JOHN DICKINSON TO JAMES OTIS 

DEAR SIR, I beg you will pardon the Liberty I take, in de 
siring you to add to the favors you have already conferrd upon 
me, by transmitting the inclos d to your much honor d Fellow- 
Citizens. 3 To attempt to express my sense of the Obligations I 
owe them, would lead me to many words, which after all my 
Labors would convey but an extremely faint Idea of what I feel. 
Permit me therefore to wave the Subject, by rendering to you, 
now deservedly placed at the Head of such excellent Citizens, my 
most hearty Thanks for the kind offices which I am sure your 
friendship has lately performed towards me. Retain I beseech you 
a Place for me in your affections, notwithstanding the Distance

Love for my Country in General, and a particular affection for the 
town of Boston. May God almighty grant her all the prosperity a 
people can know, and that she may always retain that esteem for 
me, which is the great Ornament of my Life, and the great Delight 
of my Soul. 

With the utmost Satisfaction I can acquaint you, that all 
America is rousing in Assertion of her Liberty. I am this moment 
told that the Assembly of Virginia have just published the most 
spirited Resolves. 1 A second Defeat of Greenvillian Art and 
Malice, I trust in heaven, will convince Great-Britain, that it is 
as difficult to cheat as to fright us into Servitude, and that she 
ought to leave us in the peaceable Enjoyment of that Liberty, 
which Americans receiv d with their Birth, and are resolv d to re

SIR, - Your patriotic conduct and great Abilities in defence of 
the rights of your fellow Citizens claim the respect and admiration 
of every Lover of their Country and Mankind. The principles on 
which I have written the History of the Stewart Monarchs are I 
flatter myself in some measure correspondent to those of the 
great Guardian of American Liberty. To you, Sir, as one of the 
most distinguished of that Number I offer a Copy of this Work. 
I beg leave to assure you that every partizan of liberty in this 
Island "simpathizes with their American Brethren: have a strong 
sense of their Virtues and a tender feeling for their sufferings, and 
that their is none among us in whom such a disposition is stronger 
than in myself. I shall be very glad to have the Honour of an ac-

2 It was the intention to defray the salaries of the civil list in America by the proceeds 
of the Townshend Duties. Thomas Pownall wrote to Hutchinson, from London, Septem 
ber 9, 1767: "However, I may venture to explain to you the first part of his [Duke of Graf- 
ton s] letter. It is meant that you shall have a handsome salary fixed as Chief Justice, as 
soon as the American revenue shall create a fund. ] think on that occasion it would be 
right to solicit a patent from the Crown for that place." A knowledge of the proposed 
salaries soon reached Massachusetts, and much was made of it in the circular letter of the 
Legislature to Deberdt in January, 1768. It served a purpose in the hands of the faction 
when Hutchinson s name came up for re-election to the Governor s Council, as Bernard 
explained to the Earl of Hillsborough: "In this interval, the two chief heads of the faction 
(Otis and Adams) told the House that the Lieutenant Governor was a pensioner of Great 
Britain, and averred that he had a warrant from the Lords of the Treasury for two hundred 
pounds a year out of the new duties which they were then opposing. This being urged in a 
manner which left no opportunity or time for refutation or explanation, gave a turn against 
him, so that, upon the second polling, he had ten votes less than before."

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

BOSTON, March 25, 1771. 

MY DEAR SIR, I am affraid you have before this time sus 
pected that I have not that warm Affection for you, which I have 
professed; ungrateful as I may appear to have been, in neglecting 
to acknowledge the Letter I received from you of the 9 Jan y- last, 
I think it is a sufficient apology to say that it was not in my Power 
to write anything that could please or profit you. I have been 
waiting for news from England worth informing you of, but in vain 
till yesterday when a Letter from Dr. Franklin to the Speaker as 
sured us that our Enemies there have at length laid aside the 
thoughts of vacating our Charter in form; 2 but this can afford no 
sort of Consolation to us if the people should be disposed to com 
pliment away the essential Rights of it as often as a ministerial 
Minion shall take it in his head to require it. 

Your Letter expresses a noble Spirit of Resentment which I 
cannot but admire; but when you once spoke the Language of 
Despair, allow me to tell you, it gave me offence. Can you think 
that this Country is to be finally subdued by a man 3 who never 
possessed real Greatness, etc. and with all his Art could never 
counterfeit it? 

You compare him to Julius Caesar, that publick Executioner of 
his Countrys Rights: He has, it is true, Caesars Ambition and 
Lust of Power; but who ever yet suspected that he had Caesars

courage? Recollect the time when he was oblig d to abandon his 
Troops, by which he had hoped to awe the People: It was then, if 
Fancy deceived me not, I observ d his Knees to tremble. I thought 
I saw his face grow pale (and I enjoyd the Sight) at the Appearance 
of the determined Citizens peremptorily demanding the Redress of 
Grievances. Did he then discover such an intrepid mind, as a man 
must be possessed of who can reduce a free People to slavery? I 
confess, we have, as Wolfe expressd it, a Choice of Difficulties; but 
they rather make one fretful than desperate. If the People are at 
present hushd into Silence, is it not a sort of sullen Silence, which 
is far from indicating your Conclusion, that the glorious Spirit of 
Liberty is vanquishd and left without hope but in miracles. It is 
the Effect of a mistaken Prudence, which springs from Indolence or 
Cowardice or Hypocricy or I know not what, in those who should 
point out to them the constitutional Methods of Opposition to 
arbitrary Power. Too many are affraid to appear for the publick 
Liberty, and would fain flatter themselves that their Pusilanimity 
is true Prudence. For the sake of their own Ease or their own 
Safety, they preach the People into paltry Ideas of Moderation: 
But in perilous times like these, I cannot conceive of Prudence 
without Fortitude; and the Man who is not resolvd to encounter 
and overcome Difficulties when the Liberty of his Country is 
threatend, no more deserves the Character of a Patriot, than an 
other does that of a Soldier who flies from his Standard. 

I expect that many who to gain the popular applause have bore 
the name of Whigs, will adore the rising Sun: They will fawn and 
flatter and even lick the Dust of their Masters feet: But you and I 
acknowledge no Master; and I trust there are more than seven 
Thousand who will scorn to bow the Knee of Servility. 

I joyn with you in resolving to persevere with all the little 
Strength we have and preserve a good Conscience: It is no Dis 
honor to be in a minority in the Cause of Liberty and Virtue : When 
the Multitude desert that Cause, we will look down upon them 
with all that Contempt, which our Caesar has been wont to cast 
upon them when they were virtuous and free. Magna est Veritas 
et praevalebit. Our Sons, if they deserve it, will enjoy the happy 
Fruits of their Fathers Struggles.

of the 4th Instant. 

The Session began with a motion made by a friend of mine, that 
a Message go up to the Govr to pray him that in Consideration of 
the many Inconveniences that attend the sitting of the Court at 
Cambridge, he would be pleasd to remove it to its ancient usual and 
only convenient Seat, the Court house in Boston. This we opposd 
with firmness as tacitly giving up our own main principles. There 
were 57 members and we obtaind a Majority against the Question 
of Nine Members including myself who acted as Moderator, Mr. 
Speaker Cushing being absent. 2 The other particulars together 
with the Speech and Answer you will see in the inclosd paper. The 
Tories I believe are greatly disconcerted, as I hope they always 
will be. 

I am much obligd for your Care in procurng for me a Boy. I 
shall be ready to receive him about the middle of next month and 
shall take the best care of him that shall be in my Power till he is 
14 years old, perfecting him in his reading and teaching him to 
write and cypher if capable of it under my own Tuition for I can 
not spare him the time to attend School. Will strictly regard his 
Morals and at the End of the time I will if his parents shall desire 
it, seek a good place for him to learn such a Trade as he and they 
shall chuse.

MY DEAR SIR, I have not at present time or Inclination to 
take up your thots in complaining of Tyrants and Tyranny. It is 
more than Time that this Country was rid of both. Your Colleague 
and the Newspapers will inform you of the Transactions of this 
Town at a late Meeting, 3 and your opinion of Hutchinson, if it is 
necessary, may be confirmd. The Town thought it proper to take, 
what the Tories apprehend to be leading Steps. We have long had 
it thrown in our faces, that the Country in general is under no such 
fears of Slavery, but are well pleasd with the measures of Adminis 
tration, that the Independency of the Governor and Judges is a 
mighty harmless and even a desireable Manoeuvre. In order to 
ascertain the Sense of the People of the province a Committee is 
appointed, of which our Patriot Otis is Chairman, 4 to open a free

Candidates for another state and even those dignified with high stations and vested with 
power can be willing to be so blinded by ambition and love of domination as to give up the 
heartfelt satisfaction of making happy, and losing the esteem of their fellow men. The 
General Court is indeed carried to Boston but done with so ill a grace as entirely destroys 
all the Merit of it." 

3 The meeting was held October 28, and the proceedings are given in the Boston Gazette,

BOSTON, Nov. 27, 1772 

MY DEAR SIR, I herewith inclose you a printed Copy, as far 
as it is workd off, of the Proceedings of this Town. The Selectmen of 
Plymouth will have it sent to them as soon as the Printers can 
finish it. The Tories are taking all imaginable Pains, to disparage 
it in the Minds of the other Towns. I am under no apprehensions 
with Regard to Plymouth. The Copy of your Petition was very 
acceptable to me; I have publishd it in three of our Papers, and 
the Friends of Liberty are highly pleasd with the Spirit of it. I am 
very desirous of knowing the consequent Proceedings of the Town 
though I doubt not but you have acted your part well. There is a 
Peice in Drapers paper under the Signature I. H. 2 said to be wrote 

1 A petition for a meeting, signed by a hundred of the reputable inhabitants of Plymouth, 
was presented to the selectmen on November 13, 1772. The meeting was not held until 
November 24, when a standing committee of communication, with James Warren as 
chairman, was named. The petition will be found in the Boston Evening Post, November 

23, 1772. 

2 Printed in the Massachusetts Gazette, November 26, 1772. It is dated H-ng-m, Nov. 

24, 1772, and contains the following reference to Plymouth: "I expect some of your writers 
will say that a doting old Fellow has published what he supposes to be the Mind of one 
Tory Town only, and that the country in general and his neighbouring Town of Plymouth 
in particular is of another mind. But it is a mistake, Mr. Draper, for as for the Town of 
Plymouth, I know many of the best Men in Plymouth who never would sign their Petition 
for a Town-Meeting; and if I was to speak my Mind I should say it was handed to them 
from a Town forty Miles off by a certain Creed-maker, who I hear drew up the circular Let-

in Hingham; If I could believe this, I should think it was the 
genuine Production of Deacon H y s Genius, it is much like the 
Rant which you and I have heard. I rather think however it was 
"fabricated" in the Cabal. You are particularly interested, in 
behalf of your Town, to take Notice of it. The same paper im 
pudently "reports" that there were not twenty men at the Town 
meeting besides the Selectmen and some of the Committee when 
the Letter was passed, which you may rely upon to be false, as 
hundreds who were present can testify. 1 You know the Tories 
have a "scurvy trick of lying" to serve the Purposes of Despotism. 
The To^ipf Roxbury have appointed a Committee of Nine to 
take iriB^iisideration the proceedings of this Town, five of this

slow 2 aBHM^fc|ayo, 3 who was foreman of the Grand Jury who 
cleard the Soldi^^and afterwards was advanced to the Rank of 
or of the Regiment, though our Friend Heath (who is of this 
Committee) thought himself, and in the Opinion of Major Genl. 
Brattle 4 was, degraded thereby. Cap. Heath 5 bids me expect that 
matters will go right at the adjournment of their Meeting. On his 
Zeal and Integrity as well as good Sense you know we may rely. I 
hear that Marblehead is to have a Meeting next Week. 6 I have re 
ceived favorable accounts from our worthy friend Mr. Gerry, 7 and 
hope for good Tidings from thence. 

ter that is to be sent from the Metropolis to all the Towns in the Province. And I am well 
informed that nothing is like to be acted in any of the Towns below Plymouth relative to 
those Matters." A reply from Plymouth was printed in the Boston Gazette, December 21, 
1772. 

1 " It is reported with some Confidence, that when the Vote passed for sending the Letter 
of Correspondence, which was about ten o clock Friday Evening, there was not twenty Men 
present, beside the Gentlemen Selectmen and some of the Committee, and that not Ten 
Persons voted for it. The country ought to be satisfied whether the Report be true or false." 
In the Gazette of December 7 is a reply signed by six Selectmen asserting that "there was a 
very respectable number of the inhabitants, who attended the meeting through the day; 
and when the letter, which had been twice read and amended in the meeting, was accepted 
and voted to be sent, it appeared to us, and we are well satisfied, that there were not less 
than three hundred inhabitants present, and in the opinion of others the number was much 
larger." See also "Candidus" in the Gazette of December 14, 1772.

BOSTON, Deer 9, 1772 

MY DEAR SIR, I had the pleasure of receiving your Letter 
of yesterday date, this Morning, by the Hands of our Friend, Mr. 
Lothrop. Am much obligd to you for the pains you took in dis 
tributing the Letters sent to your Care. I am very sorry to find in 
your Letter anything that discovers in you the least approach 
towards Despair. Nil desperandum. That is a Motto for you and 
rne. All are not dead; and where there is a Spark of patriotick 
J fire, we will enkindle it. Say you, that the Tories spare no pains to 
^disparage our Measures? I knew they would, and should have 
greatly doubted of the Importance of the Measures if they had not 
been much nettled. 

The Sachem of Chesemuttock is a Bastard, and has none of the 
Blood of his ancient Predecessors running in his Veins, he is pitifull, 
contemptible. I am glad your promising young Genius has under 
taken to chastize the Hingham Writer, 1 though I could wish he 
had a fitter Subject to employ his pen. Who knows but he may rise 
to be one day, under God, the Savior of his Country. You "wish 
that our Measures would take a general Run." So do I; and I be 
lieve they will. Could you think that Lancaster would fall in with 
them? If they should, what Prospects would you not entertain of 
other Towns? I have a verbal Message from a sensible Whig there, 
that he expected they would act with Spirit, and that even the 
Tories there exclaim against the Independency of the Judges. 

I He signed "From a Lover of Truth and his Country." 



1772] Warren-Adams Letters 15 

The Selectmen of Medford have unanimously agreed to call a 
Meeting of their Town. Charlestown have met, and appointed a 
Committee to consider the Independency, and report three Weeks 
hence. 1 Our Pamphlet was read and upon the Motion of your 
Cousin, the Consideration of it was referrd till March Meeting! 
I expect every Moment to hear from Marblehead; they had their 
Meeting the day before yesterday; it is reported that they have 
appointed a Committee to write to ours, after the good Example 
of Plymouth, and that Coll. Orne 2 and Mr. Gerry are of the Com 
mittee, two Gentlemen whose good Sense and Integrity as well as 
firmness I think may be much relyed upon. Roxbury I have Rea 
son to hope will terminate Matters well at their Adjournment next 
Monday. There has been no Dissension among the friends of the 
Cause here. None between my Brother Otis and myself. It is 
likely this is one of the Tory Lies at Plymouth. It may arise from 
some of the Whigs refusing when nominated to be of our Com 
mittee; but I believe most of them were then unaware of the evil 
Tendency of their Conduct. Mr. Cushing has frequently met with 
the Committee, and appears to be hearty in forwarding the Meas 
ure. I am informd that your own Minister refused, when desired, 
to read the Letter of this Town; You will excuse me if I whisper 
in your Ear, that in my opinion it would have done as much Good 
as one of his Sermons, the Benefit of which however you would not 
have been deprived of. 

The Tories are determined to play a poor hand to the best Ad 
vantage; they are therefore for instructing the Representatives to 
prevent the Independency of the Judges taking place; but it must 
be done by enlarging their Salaries, which would be a tacit ac 
knowledgment of a Right in the Crown and making a mean Bar 
gain. This Manoeuvre in my Opinion is most to be apprehended. 
I rest with Esteem Yours affectionately

Jany 4, 1773 

DEAR MRS. WARREN, Your kind Favor of Novr 13 was 
truly animating. That noble patriotic spirit which sparkles thro 
your agreeable Letter must certainly warm the heart that has the 
least Sensibilities, especially must it invigorate a mind Possest of 
a like Fellow feeling for this once happy Country. But as my mind 
is too often apt to harbor gloomy Ideas I very much Fear whether 
the last Noble exertion of those truly Patriotic Spirits who have 
formed a newly established Correspondence will meet with the 
desird Success. What a spirit of contradiction and Toryism do we 
see prevailing! how often do we see people blind to their own in 
terests Precipitately madding on to their own destruction. 

I think one of the most extraordinary Political Maneuvers this 
Century has produced is the Ministerial Mandate to the New- 
portians for transporting them a thousand Leagues for Trial. 

America you have reason to tremble and arouse if we of this side 
of the Atlantic are not able to say to this Royal Vengeance, hitherto 
shalt thou go and no further, here shall thy proud Waves be stayd. 

1 should rejoice to see the Plymothean Spirit prevail which dis 
covers such a Noble disinterested Virtue and such a sacred regard 
to rights purchasd at the expence of every thing Valuable by those 
persevering Self denying Patriarchs who if permitted to be Specta 
tors of these Terrestrial Scenes must view those of their Sons who 
set so little Value upon the dear bought purchases with displeasure. 
Many are waiting impatiently the meeting of our Assembly ear 
nestly wishing they may be endued with that Spirit of True Lib 
erty and independance which they have discoverd on former 
Occasions. I hope Coll. Warren wont fail of favoring his Country 
with his presence at that important Crisis where every eye will be 
upon our Political Fathers. . . .

I must now give you joy on the diffusion of that noble Spirit of 
Liberty we have Lately seen exhibited. Our house of Commons 
deserve immortal Praise. What a disinterested Largeness of Soul 
have they Shown. How happy the heart that has never opened 
itself to the Flattering allurements of Ambition! that heart must 
feel the Divine pleasure of communicating happiness to Posterity. 
Free from the ignoble Satisfaction of aggrandising its little self 
such heavenly Beneficence which extends its Views must be the 
true Source of Felicity. I heartily wish a Perseverance in the Bliss 
ful path and may every Avaritious Despot who aims at grasping 
all the good things with which heaven meant to Bless Mankind 
be made sensible he is not the only Figure of importance in the 
Creation. 

I have not been to the Capital for more than three months. I 
suppose when I make my appearance I shall look not unlike one of 
the last Century, at least like one unacquainted with Polite Life, 
the encreasing dissipation the round of Elegant amusements which 
are become the work of every Evening have not those Attractive 
Charms for you and myself. Neither are we calld to support under 
the intolerable dissapointment of not shining at a Concert or a Ball 
by reason of the rude Season nor the mortifying loss of a Morgan

Lives of those who walkd the stage before us or perhaps improving

presence and assistance the last Session 1 hope at the important

ABIGAIL ADAMS TO MERCY WARREN 

BOSTON December 5 1773 
MY DEAR MRS WARREN, 

You, Madam, are so sincere a Lover of your Country, and so 
Hearty a Mourner in all her Misfortunes that it will greatly ag 
gravate your anxiety to hear how much she is now oppressed and 
insulted. To you who have so thoroughly looked thro the Deeds of 
Men, and Develloped the Dark designs of a Rapatio 1 Soul. 

No action however base or sordid, no measure however Cruel 
and Villanous will be matter of any Surprize. 

The Tea that bainfull weed is arrived. Great and I hope effec 
tual opposition has been made to the landing of it. To the publick 
papers I must refer you for particulars. You will there find that 
the proceedings of our Citizens have been united spirited and firm. 
The flame is kindled and like lightning it catches from Soul to 
Soul. Great will be the devastation if not timely quenched or 
allayed by some more Lenient Measures. 

Altho the mind is Shocked at the thought of Sheding Humane 
Blood, more especially the Blood of our Countrymen and a civil 
war is of all wars the most dreadfull, Such is the present spirit that 
prevails, that if once they are made desperate Many, very Many of 
our Heroes will Spend their lives in the cause with the Speach of 
Cato in their Mouths " what a pitty it is, that we can dye but once

Such is the present Situation of affairs that I tremble when I 
think what may be the direfull consequences. And in this Town 
must the Scene of action lay, my Heart beats at every Whistle I

Slavery. I will then write further till then my worthy friend adieu. 

December II 

Since I wrote the above a whole week has elapsed and nothing 
new occurred concerning the tea. Having met with no opportu 
nity of sending this I shall trespass further upon your patience. I 
send with this the I volm of Moliere and should be glad of your 
oppinion of them. I cannot be brought to like them. It seems to 
me to be a general want of Spirit, at the close of every one I have 
felt disappointed. There are no characters but what appear unfin 
ished and he seems to have ridiculed vice without engageing us to 
Virtue; and tho he sometimes makes us laugh, yet tis a Smile of in 
dignation. There is one Negative Virtue of which he is possessed, I 
mean that of Decency. His Cit, turnd Gentleman, among many 
other has met with approbation. Tho I can readily acknowledge that 
the cit by acting so contrary to his real character has displayed a 
stupid vanity justly deserving ridicule, yet the fine Gentleman who 
defrauds and tricks him is as much the baser character as his ad 
vantages are superior to the others. Moliere is said to have been 
an Honest Man, but Sure he has not coppied from his own Heart. 
Tho he has drawn many pictures of real life, yet all pictures of life 
are not fit to be exibited upon the Stage. I fear I shall incur the 
charge of vanity by thus criticising upon an author who has met 
with so much applause. You, Madam, I hope will forgive me. I 
should not have done it if we had not conversd about it before. 
Your judgment will have great weight with your Sincere Friend l

MY DEAR SIR, I had the pleasure of receiving your Letter 
of the i6th Instant, but not till Eleven Days after it was written. 
The pressing Invitation you have repeatedly given me, to your 

I Letters from John Adams to James Warren, December 17 and 22, 1773, in this col 
lection, arc printed in Life and Works of John Adams, ix. 333, 334.

annual Festivity, is very obliging. My Heart was much set upon 
it; and I had prepared to go, with one of my Neighbors, a very 
worthy Man, but was the Evening before prevented, not to say 
forbid, by some of our Common Friends. You are sensible that I 
am the Servant of all. 

It is a great Consolation to find, that our Friends in the Coun 
try approve of the Conduct of this and the Neighboring Towns at 
the late Meetings. We are assured of this by the Letters we al 
most daily receive. I think we have put our Enemies in the wrong; 
and they must in the Judgment of rational Men, be answerable 
for the Destruction of the Tea, which their own Obstinacy had 
rendered necessary. Notwithstanding what your Tories have 
given out, the People here are universally pleas d, excepting the 
disconcerted Hutchinson and his few, very few Adherents. 

The Plymouth Letter and Resolves are highly applauded by 
all the Friends of Liberty. 1 The Protest, 2 as you will of Course 
easily perceive, is the subject of Contempt. One of the Signers has 
already cryed, peccavi! and publishd his Recantation; and between 
you and me, if the others whom they have pressd, or rather coaxd 
into their Service, have no more to say for themselves than it 
seems he has, the Party have Nothing to boast of. 

We had yesterday the Return of Mr Revere who at the Request 
of the Committee of Correspondence carried the important News 
of the Fate of the Tea to New York. By him we are informed, that 
a Tea Ship with 270 Chests had arrived at Charlestown, South 
Carolina. The Inhabitants were determined she should return 
with her detested Cargo. Before the Arrival of this and the News 
from Boston, the Citizens of New York had got to be divided; 
many of them being for storing the Tea. But immediately they 
became united and determined that it should not be landed; and 
Governor Tryon made a Virtue of Necessity and promisd that it 
should be sent (when it arrivd) directly back to London. This 
will operate much against Hutchinson; who, I think, in every part 
of his Conduct, discovers the Want of those Abilities, which his 
too liberal Countrymen have supposd him to have. The Ministry

could not have devisd a more effectual Measure to unite the Colo 
nies. Our Committee have on this Occasion, opend a Correspond 
ence with the three New England Colonies, besides New York and 
Philadelphia. Old Jealousies are removed, and perfect Harmony 
subsists between them. The Committee of the House seems to be 
the only inactive Body. I am sorry to say it, tho to you only. 

The General Assembly, I am informd will meet on the 26th of 
next month. There is much to be done by the House and much 
will be done, if Timidity does not prevent it. You must not fail, 
with Mr. Lothrop l to attend. The Cause will suffer by your Ab 
sence. The House will forfeit their Honor and the Confidence of 
the virtuous Part of their Constituents, if they do not conduct 
the Affair of the Judges in particular, with Dignity. 

I must recommend your retracting Townsman to your Favor. 
I dare say you can furnish us with some Anecdotes, respecting the 
Protest. I hear that many Towns in the Country are calling 
Meetings. The Instituting Committees of Correspondence will as 
you predicted be attended with great and good Consequences. I 
conclude in haste, with due Regards to Mr. Lothrop and other 
honest Men. Your assured friend, 

S. ADAMS 

We are concernd that we hear nothing of the Tea at Cape Cod. 
It is thought by some of our friends in London, that our Petition 
against the great Delinquents will not be brot to a Hearing unless 
they desire it, but that they will be removed, that Lord Dartmouth 
will resign and Weymouth succeed him. 

JOHN ADAMS TO MERCY WARREN 

BRAINTREE Jan 3 1774 

MADAM, I remember that Bishop Burnet in a letter he once 
wrote to Lady Rachell Russell, the virtuous Daughter of the great 
Southampton, and unfortunate wife of Lord Russell who died a 
Martyr to English Liberties, says, " Madam I never attempt to 
write to you but my Pen conscious of its Inferiority falls out of my 
Hand." The polite Prelate did not write to that excellent Lady in

so bold a figure with half the Sincerity that I could apply it to my 
self when writing to Mrs. Warren. 

I will however strive to grasp my Pen hard enough to write one 
Line in answer to her kind Billet [of] December 30. 

Mr. Adams assures Mrs. Warren, that nothing would have 
given him greater Pleasure than a Visit to Plymouth at the late 
Anniversary, but it was out of his Power. He thanks Mr. and Mrs. 
Warren however most heartily for their very kind and repeated 
Invitations. He shall think himself happy if he can find an oppor 
tunity, before the Month of May to make a Visit to his Friends at 
Plymouth, but it has been his Misfortune to have been so often 
and so long absent from home for these twelve months past, that 
he really thinks his Duty to his family oblige him to leave it as 
little as possible. 

Mrs. Warren is pleased to mention Mr. Adams s "needfull ap 
plication to public, and his close Attention to private Business." 
His private Business, Madam, has been totally annihilated these 
twelve months past and more by the inauspicious course of public 
affairs, and he has no kind of Prospect of its ever coming into 
Existence again. He has therefore, learnt the important Lesson of 
Resignation to what he cannot alter and should be very happy the 
remainder of his Days to get his Bread by his Labour and Attention 
to a Farm. He thinks he could shine as an industrious Farmer, but 
he is too old to make a Figure in Arms the Profession to which we 
must for the future perhaps be obliged for our Safety and our Lib 
erty as much as formerly we were to that of the Law. If the Stand 
ards should be erected and a Camp formed, however, ten to one 
but he flies to it, but whether it will be for Shelter or as a Volunteer, 
Time alone must discover. 

He thanks Mrs. Warren most kindly for her friendly Wishes 
for his Peace, Health, and Prosperity, and especially, when she 
wishes that he may return Laden with the Applauses of his Coun 
try, but most of all when she wishes he may return with a self 
approving Mind. Of the last he is sure, if plain, direct, simple and 
sincere Intentions to do what the cause of Truth, Justice Liberty 
and Humanity according to his Conceptions require of him, at 
whatever Hazard it may be can insure it, and as long as he shall

act upon these Principles he does not doubt of enjoying that sweet 
est Music to an honest Ear the approbation of his Country, for 
this is seldom refused to Integrity of Heart, how inconsiderable 
soever the abilities that direct it. I am, Madam, with more esteem 
than I have Power or Words to express your Friend and Servt

PLYMOUTH, January the 3d, 1774 

DEAR SIR, I received your last, 2 and am to acknowledge that 
the Contents of it gave me great pleasure. Have for some time 
thought it necessary that the People should strike some bold 
stroke, and try the Issue. They have long enough submitted to 
Oppressions and Insults following one another in a rapid Succes 
sion without finding any Advantage. They have now indeed passed 
the River, and left no Retreat, and must therefore abide the Con 
sequences. What those will be seems to be the great matter of 
Speculation, and as People are determined by Reason, or by the 
frightful List of Scarecrows and Bug bears (mentioned in your last, 
and which are employed on this Occasion) their speculations will 
differ. As your Judgment will be regulated by the first I should be 
glad to hear it. I think the Ministry have one way at least to 
avoid the necessity of advancing or retreating at this time, and 
that is by laying the Blame of the whole on their own, and East 
India Company s Officers, which have drove the People to this 
desperate step, and this Justice and Truth (Company they have 
not been used to) will countenance them in. In what proportion 
this Blame is to be laid to each may be adjusted among them, and 
if they quarrel in the settlement of that matter, we may avail our 
selves of the old Proverb. I admire Doane s reasoning, and if he 
was not assisted by the Author of the Letter in the Methodical 
Arraignment of his Propositions I think he reasoned better on this, 
than any other Occasion. I made good use of your Letter without 
mentioning the Author s Name, to encounter the Tory Bugbears

and allay the frightful Apprehensions they had raised in some 
minds, otherwise firm. I congratulate you on the Union of Senti 
ment and Spirit prevailing through the Continent, which makes 
even our Tory Protestors hang their Ears, and may in Time affect 
the obdurate Heart and inveterate Resolution of H[utchinso]n

The recantation made in Boston by one of our Protestors has sick-

are still at home. I am inclined to think many or several others 
here will follow his Example, tho great Pains are taken to prevent

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

BOSTON, March 31, 1774 

MY DEAR SIR, I have for some time past been waiting for the 
arrival of a Ship from London, that I might have some thing of 
Importance to communicate to you. No Ship has yet arrivd. I 
cannot however omit writing to you by our worthy Friend Air. 
Watson, by whom I receivd your obliging Letter of the 27 Instant. 
Although we have had no Arrival from London directly to this 
Place, we have heard from thence by the Way of Philadelphia as 
you have doubtless observd in the Newspapers. The account they 
first received of our Opposition to the East India Act as it is called, 
particularly the Transactions at Liberty Tree, they treated with 
Sneer and Ridicule, but when they heard of the Resolves of the 
Body of the People at the Old South Meeting house the Place from 
whence the Orders issued for the Removal of the Troops from this 
Town in 1770, they put on grave Countenances. No Notice is 
taken of America in the King s Speech. Our Tories, as you observe, 
tell us to expect Regiments to be quartered among us. What 
Measures an injudicious Ministry, (to say the least of them) will 
take cannot easily at present be foreseen, it will be wise for us to 
be ready for all Events, that we may make the best Improvement of 
them. It is probable that Mr. Hutchinson will make the Death of

his Brother Oliver l a plea for postponing a Voyage to London, 
and if troops should arrive it may be best ihat he should be [absent]. 
I never suffer my Mind to be overmuch [cut] prospects. Sufficient 
for the Day is the Evil thereof. It is our Duty at all Hazards to 
preserve the Publick Liberty. Righteous Heaven will graciously 
smile on every manly and rational Attempt to secure that best of 
all his Gifts to Man from the ravishing hand of lawless and brutal 
Power. 

Mr. Watson will inform you what Steps our Committee of Cor 
respondence have taken with Regard to the Establishment of a 
Post Office upon constitutional Principles. Mr. Goddard 2 who 
brought us Letters from New York, Newport and Providence re 
lating to that Subject, is gone with Letters from us on the same 
Subject to the principal trading Towns as far as Portsmouth. I will 
acquaint you with the state of the Affair when he returns, and our 
Committee will, I doubt not, then write to yours. The Colonies 
must unite to carry through such a Project, and when the End is 
effected it will be a pretty grand Acquisition. 

I refer you also to Mr. Watson, who can inform you respecting 
one of your Protesters who has been in Town. The Tryumph of 
your Tories as well as ours I hope is short. We must not however 
boast as he that putteth off the Harness. H[utchinso]n is politi 
cally sick and I fancy despairs of returning Health. The "lack- 
learning" Judge 3 I am told is in the Horrors, and the late Lieu 
tenant l (joynt Author of a late Pamphlet intitled Letters etc. 4 ) a 
few Weeks ago "died and was buried." Excuse me from enlarging 
at Present. I intend to convince you that I am "certainly a Man 
of my Word." In the Mean time with assurance of unfeigned 
Friendship for Mrs. Warren and your agreeable Family in which 
Mrs. Adams joyns me, I remain Yours Affectionately

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

MY DEAR SIR, I beseech you to implore every Friend in 
Boston by every thing dear and sacred to Men of Sense and Virtue 
to avoid Blood and Tumult. They will have time enough to dye. 
Let them give the other Provinces opportunity to think and resolve. 
Rash Spirits that would by their Impetuosity involve us in un- 
surmountable Difficulties will be left to perish by themselves 
despisd by their Enemies, and almost detested by their Friends. 

Nothing can ruin us but our Violence. Reason teaches this. 
I have indubitable Intelligence, dreadful, as to the Designs against 
us; consolatory, if we are but prudent. 

These are the Sentiments of a man, who, you know, my dear 
Sir, loves the People of Boston and that Government, with the 
Tenderness of a Brother. I am your affectionate Friend.

PLYMOUTH, July the I4th, 1774 

DEAR SIR, -- Yours of the 25th of last month 1 never reached 
me till yesterday. It would have given me great pleasure to have 
seen you when I returned from Salem, 2 and I was really greatly dis 
appointed to find you and Family gone, and more especially as I 
was apprehensive I should have no other Opportunity of seeing 
you, till the Time called for your Attendance at the Grand Coun 
cil of America, 3 an Assembly in my Opinion of as great Dignity and 
Importance as any, either ancient or modern, that ever met. How 
ever, as I am deprived of the pleasure of seeing you, I shall sin 
cerely wish and pray, that your satisfaction and pleasure on this 
Journey may fully equal the Honour of being a Member of so 
august a Body. Which is in Effect wishing that you may conduct 
Matters in a way the most Honorable to yourselves, and advan-

tageous to the publick. Great are our Expectations, and great will 
be the Expectations in Europe; and therefore great and difficult is 
the Task assigned you. With these Sentiments my Friendship to 
you had no Interest in your Appointment further than to promote 
your Honour. My Friendship to my Country engaged me to it, 
and when I knew it was at the Expence of your Ease, and so well 
satisfied am I with the Major Part of our Committee, 1 and such 
Expectations have I from the Zeal and firmness of the other Colo 
nies in this measure, that I have not given myself the Trouble to 
think much about the measures they will take. I presume the 
greater part of you will be Masters, learned in politicks and the 
true Interest of your Country, not Scholars yet to learn them. 
Prophets replete with the true Spirit of Prophecy, and Statesmen 
both wise and upright. From you therefore we shall look for 
streams that shall gladden all the Cities and Towns in North 
America, and confound the Barbarous Politicks of Britain. With 
these Sentiments of your Body, it certainly would be presumtion 
in me, to advise to measures, or conduct. However to a Friend 1 
will venture to say, I apprehend much greater danger from the 
Timidity and narrow Plans of some of your Body, than I do from 
the Spirit and enlarged views of the rest of you. My Opinion is, 
that the Confidence of the People in the Congress is such that they 
will support whatever Plan you adopt, however spirited, and be in 
danger of resting satisfied with the Terms you may be contented 
with, however inadequate to their rights and Interests. And be 
sides Administration be from the first more encouraged to go on 
with their System than provoked by the last. That we have noth 
ing to expect from their Justice, but every thing to hope from their 
fears, is a maxim as true, and perhaps as wise as any of Solomon! 
Therefore if I was enquired of, what I thought should be done with 
the Claim of Exemption from Parliamentary Legislation, as well as 
Taxation, and some other Grand Questions that have been agitated 
here, I should answer that it was proper, practicable, expedient, 
wise, just, good, and necessary, that they should be held up in

their full extent in the Congress at Philadelphia, and that means 
should be devised to support them. 

To determine on an annual Congress I think very important, 
both for the purpose of depressing the Scheems of our Enemies and 
raising the Spirits and promoting the Interest of our Friends. 1 A 
Rotation I am very fond of in most Cases, but in this at present 
should be for confining it only to a new election annually. A 
scarcity of men fit to govern such mighty Interests clashing in the 
present Contests, is a sufficient Objection to a further Limitation, 
and that reason will likewise prevail to alter your determination 
not to engage in politicks on any other System.. The want of Grat 
itude in Mankind, their little Attention to their true Interest, and 
the consequent Fate of many of their friends, are really disagree 
able reflections. But if Brutus and Cassius, Hampden, Sydney, 
Harrington, etc. had lived in inglorious Ease, they might have died 
in a few months after, in languishing and painful Sickness, without 
Fame, without the Applause of the vertuous of all ages. I have 
strong faith that the now rough and perilous paths of politicks 
will soon be smoothed, and that our sons may walk in them without 
danger, especially if we submit the Instruction of them to our two 
Friends 2 you mention, who will certainly form them to Vertue, and 
establish that Integrity that will secure them at least good Con 
sciences. The Cause of Liberty, Truth and Vertue, must be sup 
ported, and in the present degenerate Situation of Mankind, that 
must be done by the few, even under the mortifying Circumstances 
of seeing the many who reap the Benefit attentive to private mat 
ters, and enriching themselves and families, even at the Expence 
of their Friends. And I presume you will never fail to be among the 
few, at a time when your Character, Circumstances, and Educa 
tion, etc conspire to call you out. . . .

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

BRAINTREE, July 17, 1774 

DEAR SIR, Among many other agreeable Things which oc- 
curr d to me on my Return from my eastern Circuit, I found your 
Letter of the fourteenth Instant. Your sentiments always inspire 
and animate me; but never more upon any Occasion, than on this. 
I believe with you that the Confidence of the People in the Con 
gress, is so great, that they will Support its Decisions, as far as pos 
sible. And indeed, It may well be expected, that many Men of 
Sound Judgment, will be of that Assembly. But, what avails, 
Prudence, Wisdom, Policy, Fortitude, Integrity, without Power, 
without Legions ? When Demosthenes, (God forgive the Vanity of 
recollecting his Example) went Ambassador from Athens to the 
other States of Greece, to excite a Confederacy against Phillip, 
he did not go to propose a Non-Importation or Non-Consumption 
Agreement ! ! ! 

You "presume the greater Part of the Number will be Masters 
in Politicks" "Prophets replete with the true Spirit of Prophecy." 
I hope it will be so. But I must say I am not one of those Masters. 
I must be a scholar. I feel my own insufficiency for this important 
Business. I confess myself ignorant of the Characters which com 
pose the Court of Great Britain as well as of the People who com 
pose the Nation; at least I have not that minute and accurate 
knowledge of either which an American Senator ought to have of 
both. I have not that Knowledge of the Commerce of the several 
Colonies, nor even of my own Province which may be necessary. 

In short, as comprehensive Knowledge of Arts and Sciences, 
especially of Law and History, of Geography, Commerce, War and 
of Life, is necessary for an American Statesman at this Time as 



30 W arren- Adams Letters [1774 

was ever necessary for a British or a Roman Senator, or a British 
or Roman General. 

Our New England Educations are quite unequal to the Produc 
tion of such great Characters. 

There is one Point in which most Men seem to be agreed viz 
that it is in our Power so to distress the Commercial and Manu 
facturing Interests in G. Britain, as to make them rise up and be 
come importunate Petitioners for us, to the King, Parliament and 
Ministry. But others deny this. Some of the higher Tories say 
that all we can do of this Kind will be despised ridiculed and 
that they can live longer without us than We can without them. 
That the distresses We can occasion would be of but a few Indi 
viduals, and the Clamours or Miseries of these will be disregarded 
as Trifling Considerations in Comparison of the Loss of the Obedi 
ence of the Colonies, etc., etc., etc. 

That nothing Short of such Distresses as should produce Con 
vulsions would effect any Thing at all. 

However I have no Faith in these Doctrines. The National 
Debts and Taxes are so excessive, that it seems to me impossible, 
the People should bear the Loss of so great a Part of their Trade. 

But what do you think of a non-Exportation to Great Britain? 
Is it expedient to advise to a general Non-Exportation? Will not 
Such a Measure hurt ourselves? What will be the Consequence? 
Must not Fish, Rice, Wheat, Tobacco, etc. etc. etc. perish on our 
Hands, or must not Thousands of Families perish who once lived 
by raising and producing those Commodities in America? 

Your Maxim, that We have nothing to expect from their Jus 
tice But everything to hope from their fears I have ever thought is 
just as "any of Solomon"; But I confess I have grown more 
Scrupulous of late than ever more disposed to discuss, examine 
and minutely weigh every political Position, than usual. I have 
employed the best Force of my Understanding, in considering this 
Apophthegm; and the Result is that We have indeed nothing to 
expect from their Justice. The Ministry, the beggarly prostituted 
Voters, high and low, have no principles of public Virtue on which 
we can depend, and they are interested to plunder us. But I am not 
so clear that we have everything to hope from their Fears. They are 



1774] JVarren- Adams Letters 31 

a gallant brave high Spirited People Still; and if any Means can be 
found to make the Chastisement of the Colonies popular, a Min 
ister, who means nothing by serving in a public Station but to 
make a Fortune in Wealth and Titles, may push a Measure to 
dreadful Extremities. Yours

DR SIR, There never was I believe, a greater Contrast, than 
I perceive, between the Noise and Hurry of Queen Street, and the 
Serene Retreat, which I enjoy here. No Clients disturb me, no 
Politicians interrupt me, no Tories vex me, no Tyrants govern me, 
I had almost said No Devils tempt or torment me. 

The chaste Pleasures of Agriculture engage me as much [as] 
Cards, or Assemblies ever did a fair Lady. You can Sympathize 
with me, in all this. You live in a Land of Rain this Year, as well 
as I, and it is our infinite Consolation to us both, to see the Wisdom 
and Benevolence of Heaven, counteracting the Folly, the Malice 
and Madness of our Tyrants. 

It would do your Heart good to see me, mowing, raking, carting 
and frolicking with my Workmen, as unconcernd as if No Port 
Bill or regulating Bill or Murder Bill, had ever existed. 

I catch myself however, now and then, among the Hay Cocks 
bestowing most hearty Execrations, on a few Villains who have 
dignified themselves by Superlative Mischief to their native 
Country the British Empire and the World. 

The Demise of the French Crown, 1 is a great Event in the Polit 
ical System of Europe, and of Consequence, must be a mighty 
Link in the Chain of Causes in American Politicks. I am not 
enough acquainted with the State of the French, Spanish and Ger 
man Courts to predict with any Confidence, what Revolutions will 
Succeed the death of Lewis I5th. But if two young Fellows at the 
Head of the German Empire, and the French Monarchy, both warm 
and active dont make Mischief in Europe it will be a Wonder.

I remember when I was young and sometimes amused myself 
with Poetry and Criticism I used to see it frequently prescribed as 
a Rule to consider how Homer or Virgill or Horace or Ovid would 
have imagined or expressed a Thing. But I believe it required al 
most as much Genius and Skill to Say how they would imagine or 
express a Thing, as they had themselves. I can t help, applying this 
Rule sometimes to Politicks, and enquiring what Plans would be 
adopted at the Congress, if a Sully, a Cecil, a Pitt or a Ximenes,

MY DEAR FRIEND, - 

The frequent Manuvers of an arbitrary G[enera]l with his dis 
ciplined Troops which spread alarms thro the Country and Occa 
sion great Commotion among a poor, oppressd, devoted, tho I 
hope determined People, often fill a Female heart with Tears. 
The preparations on Boston neck, the Assembled multitude lately 
at Cambridge 2 with many other Circumstances give me a painful

2 Rowe, Diary, 285, notes on September 7, "The General has Doubled the Guards at 
the Neck and I believe designs to Fortify it"; on September 10, "The 59th Regiment came 
from Salem and encamped on the West Side of Boston Neck." On Sunday, the I4th, some 
officers of the navy spiked the guns of the North Battery. The assemblage at Waltham, 
Watertown and Cambridge was caused by the conduct of General Brattle, who made a 
"flimsy Recantation" and the people dispersed on the following day. This and the insults 
to Hallowell, a commissioner of customs, led Gage to reinforce the troops on the Neck.

Idea of the Horrors of Civil War, and with you I cant help antici 
pating the distresses Consequent thereon; but that Centre of all 
Consolation to which you point me That grand Superintend- 
ant of the Universe is the only firm Foundation for us to Build 
our hopes upon, our Cause is righteous. Let us Posses our Souls 
in Patience. 

By Capt. Scot who has Lately arrivd we are told by the repre 
sentations of Mr. H[utchinso]n the people of England are made 
to believe we are perfectly acquiescent under the new model of 
Government and other Cruel Acts. How can this Insulted People 
any longer forbear bursting forth with rage and desperation! Must 
not that heart be truly Infernal that Could Meditate such Acts of 
barbarity and even persuade people to believe they are Acts of 
Mercy and goodness ! after this what is not the heart of Man Capa 
ble of? The Merchants of London are pouring in Loads of English 
goods. If the united Virtue of American Delegates is not exerted 
for our help, we are we must be ruind. The dissolution of all Gov 
ernment gives a dreadful Prospect, the fortifying Boston Neck, 
the huge Canon now mounted there, the busy preparations, the 
agility of the Troops, give an Horrid prospect of an intended 
Battle. Kind Heaven avert the Storm! I hope Coll. Warren in 
tends to meet the General Assembly. I hear the Constitutional 
Council Intend to Resume their Seats. . . . 

I have Lately receivd great pleasure from an ingenious Satire 
on that Female Foible Love of dress in the Royal American Maga 
zine. 1 I have heard the Author guessd to be Miss Mercy Scollay, 
and the Gentleman who requested it Dr. Warren. I am not enough 
acquainted with that Lady s Poetic Talents to judge whether they 
are equal to that elegant production. Mr. Winthrop joyns in the 
Sincerest regards to Coll. Warren and you. I subscribe your

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. 1 ADAMS MSS. 
PLYMOUTH, December 19, 1774 

DEAR SIR, It always give me pleasure to hear of the Existence 
and Health of my Friend and his Family, and more especially to 
have it from his own hand. 

The partiality discovered in yours of the I3th Instant is a strong 
Evidence of Friendship. I am sorry it should give you any Uneasi 
ness, if the Elections you refer to are not just such as you and I 
should approve. I am inclined to think they would not have been 
mended in the way you now think of. The drudgery of Applica 
tion with some little Experience may qualifie a man to make a 
tolerable, or at least not a disagreeable figure in any small Circle, 
but nothing can supply the want of those Abilities, and that per- 
ticular Genius that alone must support his Character in the other 
Station, and perhaps be necessary to preserve even his Memory 
from Contempt if not Infamy. I have therefore no uneasiness my 
self, but what arises from pride, which in an Officer may assume 
the Title of military Honour, and may reduce me to the Dilemma 
of either forfeiting my Character by not doing my duty, or lessen 
ing it by doing it under certain Circumstances. I am pleased to 
find your Town makes such a Figure in the military way. The 
Spirit is catching, and spreads into every Corner, and bids fair to 
cherish the seeds, and support the Stock of a rising Empire. 

The last Vessel from England arrived here last Fryday, left 
Bristol 8th. November. I am told the Master says, that near two- 
thirds of the Members chosen are new ones, 2 that the general Ex 
pectation was that the American Grievances would be redressed. 
He dined in Company with Mr. Burke two or three days before 
he came away, who was in high Expectation of a Committee from 
your Congress, which was looked for every day, and that Doctor 
Franklin had postponed his Voyage to America on the same Ac 
count. However they may be disappointed in this, I presume be 
fore now they have seen your demands. Extending so far beyond 
the repeal of the Acts of the last Session, that it will be hard work

to Cure the wounds, without leaving a Splinter behind, and I 
hope if there be one left, it will rankle till extracted. Will the Con 
tinent be satisfied short of their demands? I hope not, but some 
times hope with fear and trembling. 

1 have been extreamly engaged since my return, as a Citizen and 
Soldier. Civil and military matters engage my whole Attention, 
and engross all my Time. To execute the Resolves of the Congress, 
to settle my military matters, and prevent the feuds and dissen- 
tions that generally arise from the Folly of some, and the Ambition 
of others, is my whole Business, and has superceded the delightful 
Study of Agriculture, and scarce left a Trace in my mind of Tull s 
fine Phylosophical System of Vegetation. If those matters con 
tinue, I may as well beat my plow shares into Swords, and pruning 
Hooks into Spears. 

I am sorry to find you half resolved not to attend our Anniver 
sary. Your Company would give me the greatest pleasure, and 
add much to the festivity of the day. . . . 

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
PLYMOUTH, January 15, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, I admire the Votes and Resolves of the Mary 
land Convention. 1 They breath a Spirit of Liberty and Union 
which does Honour to them, and indeed the whole Continent. I am 
greatly puzzled to determine what Consequences the united force 
of all these things will produce in Britain. They must be infatu 
ated to a degree I can hardly conceive of, if these things make no 
Impression, and yet in general I think, or rather fear, they will 
not. I am upon the whole much of the Opinion of your friend 
Chase, 2 that we have but little room to hope for a favourable Event, 
and that now is the Time, the exact Crisis, to determine the point, 
and the sooner the better, before the Tories here can compleat 
their efforts to disunite and embarrass. They are more assidu 
ous than Satan was with our first Parents, and equal him in deceit, 
and Falsehood, and with many find Success. No Stone is left un-

turned to effect their purposes. By that means we are continually 
perplexed, which added to the Contemplation (from one time to 
another) of a War at last, is (as you say) a state as bad as can be. 

The time for the setting of our Congress draws nigh. I am im 
patient to hear that you are a member, and shall be unhappy if 
you are not. What reason can be given that the question for as 
suming and exercising Government has not been stated and agi 
tated in the publick Papers. Has any particular policy prevented? 
It seems to me it would have had good effects on the other Colo 
nies. They may hardly believe it so necessary as we know it to be, 
while so little is said about it. 

The Tories it is observed hold up their heads lately whether from 
Encouragement taken from the late publications, or a Spirit of 
delusion diffused among them by the infernal Junto at Boston, I 
know not. 

Inclosed are for your Amusement two acts of a dramatic per 
formance. Composed at my particular desire they go to you as 
they came out of the hand of the Copier, without pointing or 
marking. If you think it worth while to make any other use of 
them, than a reading, you will prepare them in that way, and give 
-, them such other Corrections and Amendments as your good Judg 
ment shall suggest. . . . l 

JAS. WARREN 

Is it consistent with prudence that we should hold our Sessions 
at Cambridge? I am not more subject to fear than others; but if 
we mean to do anything important, I think it is too near the whole 
strength of our Enemies. If not, I shall repent leaving my own 
fire side at this severe Season. I shall be glad to hear from you be 
fore you leave Home. 

MERCY WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 

PLIMOUTH, January 30, 1775 

SIR, The very polite introduction to yours of Jan. 3d. I con 
sider not only as a Compliment far beyond any merit 1 can presume 
to claim, but as resulting in some Measure from that partial Byas 

I The Group, a Fare f. These two acts were printed in the Boston Gazette, January 23, 1775. 



Warren-Adams Letters 37 

which ever leads us to view through the most favourable Medium 
whatever regards those we consider in the Light of Friendship. 

But when assured that I think myself both honoured and 
obliged whenever Mr. Adams takes up the Pen to favour me with 
a Line, I hope he will again attempt to grasp it hard enough to 
gratify me further in the same way. More especially as I am about 
to submit a casuistical query to his Decision, in whose judgment 
I place great Confidence, both from the Ability and Rectitude of 
Mind which guide its Determinations. 

Personal Reflections and sarcastic Reproaches have generally 
been decryed by the wise and the worthy, both in their Conversa 
tion and Writings. And though a Man may be greatly criminal in 
his Conduct towards the Society in which he lives. How far, sir, do 
you think it justifiable for any individual to hold him up the Ob 
ject of public Derision. 

And is it consistent with the Benevolent System of Christianity 
to vilify the Delinquent, when we only wish to ward of the fatal 
Consequences of his Crimes. 

But though from the particular Circumstances of our unhappy 
time, a little personal Acrimony might be justifiable in your Sex, 
must not the female Character suffer. (And will she not be sus 
pected as deficient in the most amiable part thereof, that Candour 
and Charity which ensures her both Affection and Esteem,) if she 
indulges her pen to paint in the darkest shades, even those whose 
Vice and Venality have rendered contemptible. 

Your undisguised Sentiments on these points will greatly oblige 
a person who is sometimes doubtful whether the solicitations of a 
beloved Friend may not lead her to indulge a satirical propensity 
that ought to be reined in with the utmost Care and Attention. 
But such are the multiplied injuries the Community receives, 
from a set of unfeeling, unprincipled Hirelings; such the Discord 
sown by their wicked Machinations, and such the Animosity of 
parties, that may we not all with some Reason apply to ourselves, 
what a noble Author has put into the Mouth of the celebrated 
Pope when meeting the admired Boileau in the Elysian Shades, 
that neither of them could boast that either their Censure or their 
praise was always free from partiallity; and that their pens were 



38 Warren- Adams Letters [1775 

often drawn against those with whom it was more shameful to 
contend, than honourable to vanquish. 

I know not what may be your opinion of a late Composition, 
but as it was so readily ushered into Light, and by a Gentleman of 
your Discernment offered to the publick Eye, you cannot won 
der if I presume you thought it might in some small degree be 
beneficial to society. If so the Author must be highly gratified, 
and will be even better pleased with picking some useful Flower 
from the Foot of Parnassus, than if she were able to ascend the 
utmost Heights, and gather the Laurel or the garland from its sum 
mit, when the glowing Beauties have no tendency either to cor 
rect the Manners of others, or to improve the Virtue of her own 
Heart. Your Criticism, or Countenance, your Approbation or 
censure, may in some particulars serve to regulate my future Con 
duct. 

In your last to Mr. Warren you seem to be quite weary of a 
state of suspence. It is painful, it is vexatious. How many years 
have the hopes of the contending parties been alternately rising 
or sinking with the Weight of a Feather, and yet little prospect of a 
period to their Employment. 

How much longer, sir, do you think the political scale can hang 
in Equilibrium. Will not Justice and Freedom soon preponder 
ate till the partizans of Corruption and Venality, even backed 
with the Weight of ministerial power, shall be made to kick the 
Beam. 

You will not think it strange that the timidity and tenderness 
of a Woman should lead her to be anxious for the Consequences of 
every important step, and very solicitous for the termination of 
those Disputes which interrupt almost every social Enjoyment 
and threaten to spread Ruin and Desolation over the fairest pos 
sessions. 

But if you, sir, will candidly excuse this interruption, I will no 
longer call off your Attention from more momentous affairs. Yet 
let me add my fervent Wishes that you and the other Gentlemen 
of the ensuing Congress may be endowed with Wisdom and Res 
olution equal to the Difficulties of the Day, and if you attempt 
to repair the shattered Constitution, or to erect a new one, may it 



Warren- Adams Letters 39 

be constructed with such symmetry of Features, such Vigour of 
Nerves, and such strength of sinew, that it may never be in the 
power of Ambition or Tyranny to shake the durable Fabrick. 

In the mean time I hope all necessary Attention will be payed 
to the personal safety of the worthy Guardians of our Freedom and 
Happiness. Which leads my trembling Heart to wish my Friends 
were at a further Remove than Cambridge, from the Headquarters 
of vindictive Enemies. 1 am, sir, with great Esteem your real 
Friend and humble Servant

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, Feb. n, 1775 

DR SIR, Mr. Archibald Buchannan and Mr. Walter Tolley, 
both of Maryland and hearty Friends of America, introduced to 
me by my Friend, Mr. Chase, are bound to the Camp and Mr. 
Chase requested a Letter from me. 

Chase is a Man of common Sense. 

I reed your Packett. I am obliged to you for opening the Letter 
from our Friend Mr. Adams, and if you had opened all the others, 
you should have been equally welcome, Altho I would not give a 
similar Permission to more than two or three other Persons in the 
World. I have no Correspondences for private Amusement, or Per 
sonal Interest, and therefore most Letters to me might be seen by 
any public Man of public Virtue, good Understanding and Com 
mon Decency without Danger, Inconvenience, or offence. But as 
so many Persons who have not all those Qualities become in the 
Course of Things public Persons, We cannot be too cautious, I 
find, what We write, whom we write to, and how it is conveyed. 

I have seen the Copy of a Letter. Let the Writer s Passions 
fume away unnoticed. Peepers often Spy disagreeable Objects. 
Let them pay for their Peeping. I have Reason to complain of 
Negligence in one Gentn and, I fear, of Unkindness in another 
upon this Occasion, but I will not complain. 

They shall take all Advantages against me that they can get. 
They cannot hurt me nor you. The only Advantage they have got 



40 Warren- Adams Letters [1775 

upon this Occasion is to torment themselves, and gratify others. 
The Gentn promised me to deliver those Letters into the Hand of 
Mr. S. A. but he did not. 

I have only this Moment to write. Yours, sincerely.

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. l ADAMS MSS. 
PLYMOUTH, February 20, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, I need not tell you that I was greatly disap 
pointed and chagrined at not seeing you at Cambridge a member 
of our Congress. 2 If it was the Choice of your Town, I know not 
how they can excuse, or even extenuate the fault. Surely a small 
Degree of Patriotism would have dictated a very different Conduct. 
My disappointment was increased by not having the pleasure of 
seeing you on my way there, or return here. As matters are, 1 am to 
content myself for the present with my share in those valuable 
publications I have the pleasure of reading every week in the 
Papers, 3 and no small pleasure it is to me to consider my particular 
Friend advancing (passibus aequis) his Country s Interest and his 
own honour, by exposing to publick view (with a nervous Elo 
quence) the Arts and Wickedness of our Enemies, and asserting by 
derisive Arguments the rights of his Country. May the Applauses 
of the present and the Blessings of future Generations (a much 
better reward to a Virtuous mind than pensions and Salaries), 

1 At Braintree. 

2 Convened February I. Colonel Joseph Palmer represented Braintree. Adams had 
been a member of the Provincial Congress of October, 1774. "As to my being of the Con 
gress, I think our town did right in not choosing me, as they left out [Ebenezer] Thayer, and 
as Mr. Palmer is as good a hand as they can employ, and having been for some time in the 
center of all their business in the County, Town and Province, is the best man they have. 
Indeed, I was not at the Meeting, and never had been at any Meeting in this Town, for 
eight years. To say the Truth, I was much averse to being chosen and shall continue so; for 
I am determined, if things are settled, to avoid public Life. I have neither Fortune, Leisure, 
Health nor Genius for it, being a man of desperate Fortune, and a Bankrupt in Business. 
I cannot help putting my Hand to the Pump, now the Ship is in a Storm, and the Hold full 
of Water; but as soon as she gets into a Calm and a Place of Safety, I must leave her. At 
such a Time as this, there are many dangerous things to be done, which nobody else will do, 
and therefore I cannot help attempting them; but in peaceful Times, there are always 
hands enough." John Adams to James Warren, March 15, 1775. Works of John Adams, ix.

united with the Goodness of his own heart, still animate into 
Exertion those great Abilities which God in his Mercy has bestowed 
for the Advantage of this Country. 

I supposed our Congress would have adjourned the day I left 
them, but it seems they found means to prolong the Sessions a few 
days without having in view any apparent Advantage that I could 
conceive of. However I hope some good will come of it. I was con 
cerned before I came away that we had then spent ten days about 
what might have been effected in four, and perhaps as well. They 
appeared to me to be dwindling into a School for debate and Crit 
icism rather than to appear as a great Assembly to resolve and 
act. A certain Lady of your Acquaintance is much concerned at 
hearing it is reported that she wrote the Group. Parson Howe 1 
told a large Company at Table that she was the Author of it. If 
this was true how came he by his Information. Would a certain 
friend of ours have so little discretion as to communicate such a 
matter to his Parson, if he knew, and much less if he only con 
jectured it. Do speak to him about it. If he has set his parson a 
prating, he ought to stop him. We have no arrivals, no news. Our 
military Gentry remain in statu quo, at the Councillors Mansion 
House at Marshfield. No body but the Tories there and here take 
any notice of them. . . .

JOHN ADAMS TO MERCY WARREN 

BRAINTREE, March 15, 1775 

MADAM, I thought myself greatly honoured by your most 
polite and agreable Letter of January the thirtieth; and I ought to 
have answered it, immediately: but a Variety of Cares and Avoca 
tions, at this troublesome Time, which I confess are not a Justifi 
cation of my Negligence, as they were the real Cause of it, will 
with your goodness of Disposition be allowed as an Excuse. 

In requesting my opinion, Madam, concerning a Point of 
Casuistry, you have done me great Honour, and I should think 
myself very happy if I could remove a Scruple from a Mind, which 
is so amiable that it ought not to have one upon it. Personal 
Reflections, when they are artfully resorted to, in order to divert 
the Attention from Truth, or from Arguments, which cannot be 
answered, are mean and unjustifiable: but We must give up the 
Distinction between Virtue and Vice, before we can pronounce 
personal Reflections, always unlawfull. Will it be said that We 
must not pronounce Cataline a Conspirator, and Borgia a Rascall, 
least we should be guilty of casting personal Reflections? The 
faithfull Historian delineates Characters truly, let the Censure fall 
where it will. The public is so interested in public Characters, that 
they have a Right to know them, and it becomes the Duty of every 
good Citizen who happens to be acquainted with them to com 
municate his Knowledge. There is no other way of preventing 
the Mischief which may be done by ill Men; no other Method of 
administering the Antidote to the Poison. 

Christianity Madam, is so far, from discountenancing the sever 
est Discrimination, between the good and the bad, that it assures 
us of the most public and solemn one conceivable, before Angells 
and Men; and the Practice and Example of Prophetts, and Apos 
tles, is sufficient to sanctify Satyr of the sharpest Kind. 



Warren- Adams Letters 43 

The Truth is, Madam, that the best Gifts are liable to the 
worst uses and abuses, a Talent at Satyr, is commonly mixed with 
the choicest Powers of Genius and it has such irresistable Charms, 
in the Eyes of the World, that the extravagant Praise, it never 
fails to extort, is apt to produce extravagant Vanity in the Satir 
ist, and an exuberant Fondness for more Praise, until he looses 
that cool Judgment, which alone can justify him. 

But the lawfulness of the Exercise of this brilliant Talent, may 
be argued from its being a natural one. Nature, which does nothing 
in vain, bestows no mental Faculties which are not designed to be 
cultivated and improved. It may also be inferred from its admira 
ble Utility and Effects. If we look into human Nature, and run 
through the various Classes of Life, We shall find it is really a dread 
of Satyr that restrains our Species from Exorbitances, more than 
Laws, human, moral or divine, indeed the Efficacy of civil Punish 
ments is derived chiefly from the Same Source. Ltjj^not the Pain, 
the Fire etc, that is dreaded so much as the Infamy and disgrace. 
So that really~EKe civil Magistrate may be~said in a""goocTSense~to 
keep the World in order, by Means of Satyr, for Gaols, Stocks, 
Whipping Posts and Gallows s are but different Kinds of it. But 
classical Satyr, such as flows so naturally and easily from the Pen 
of my excellent Friend has all the Efficacy, and more, in Support 
of Virtue and in Discountenancing of Vice, without any of the 
Coarseness and Indelicacy of those other Species of Satyr, the 
civil and political ones. 

If you examine the Life and Actions of your poorest, lowest and 
most despised Neighbour, the meanest Servant you know, you will 
find, that there is some one or more Persons, of whose Esteem and 
good opinion he is ambitious, and whose Scorn and Derision he 
dreads perhaps more than any other Evil. ^nd_this_Desire of 
Esteem and dread of Scorn is the prindj3le_that goyernsLJiis- Life 
and Actions. Now the Business of Satyr is to expose Vice and 
vicious Men as such to this Scorn and to enrobe^Ziitue in all the 
Charms which fancy can paint, and by this Means to procure her 
Lovers and Admirers. -^ 

Of all the Genius s which have yet arisen in America, there has\ \ 
been none, Superiour, to one, which now shines, in this happy, 



44 Warren- Adams Letters [1775 

this exquisite Faculty. Indeed, altho there are many which have 
received more industrious Cultivation I know of none, ancient or 
modern, which has reached the tender the pathetic, the keen and 
severe, and at the same time, the Soft, the Sweet, the amiable and 
the pure in greater Perfection. I am, madam, with great Respect,

CONCORD, April 6, 1775 

MY DEAR MERCY, Four days ago I had full Confidence that I 
should have had the pleasure of being with you this day, we were 
then near closeing the Session. Last Saturday we came near to 
an Adjournment, were almost equally divided on that question, 
the principle argument that seemd to preponderate, and turn in 
favour of sitting into this week was the prospect of News and 
News we have. 1 Last week things wore rather a favourable aspect, 
but alas how uncertain are our prospects. Sunday Evening brought 
us accounts of a Vessel at Marblehead from Falmouth, and the 
English Papers etc by her. I have no need to recite perticulars. 
you will have the whole in the Papers, and wont wonder at my 
forgoeing the pleasure of being with you. I dare say you would 
not desire to see me till I could tell you that I had done all in 
my power to secure and defend us and our Country. We are no 
longer at a loss what is Intended us by our dear Mother. We 
have Ask d for Bread and she gives us a Stone, and a serpent for a 
Fish. However my Spirits are by no means depressd, you well 
know my Sentiments of the Force of both Countrys, you know 
my opinion of the Justness of our Cause, you know my Confidence 
in a Righteous Providence. I seem to want nothing to keep up 
my Spirits and to Inspire me with a proper resolution to Act my 
part well in this difficult time but seeing you in Spirits, and know 
ing that they flow from the heart. How shall I support myself if 
you suffer these Misfortunes to prey on your tender frame and 
Add to my difficulties an affliction too great to bear of itself. The

Vertuous should be happy under all Circumstances. This state 
of things will last but a little while. I believe we shall have many 
chearful rides together yet. We proposed last week a short ad 
journment and I had in a manner Engaged a Chamber here for my 
Beloved and pleased myself with the health and pleasure the 
Journey was to give her; but I believe it must be postponed till 
some Event takes place and changes the face of things. All things 
wear a warlike appearance here. This Town is full of Cannon, 
ammunition, stores, etc., and the Army long for them and they 
want nothing but strength to Induce an attempt on them. The 
people are ready and determine to defend this Country Inch by 
Inch. The Inhabitants of Boston begin to move. The Selectmen 
and Committee of Correspondence are to be with us, I mean our 
Committee, this day. The Snow Storm yesterday and Business 
prevented them then. From this Conference some vigorous reso 
lutions may grow. But to dismiss publick matters, let me ask 
how you do and how do my little Boys, especially my little Henry, 
who was Complaining. I long to see you. I long to sit with you 
under our Vines etc and have none to make us afraid. Do you 
know that I have not heard from you since I left you, and that is a 
long while. It seems a month at least. I can t believe it less. I 
intend to fly Home I mean as soon as Prudence Duty and Honour 
will permitt. I am with regards to all Friends and the greatest 
Expressions of Love and regard to you, your very affect. Husband,

Love to my Boys. I feel disposed to add to this long letter but 
neither time nor place will permit it. April yth. I am up this 
morning to add. Mr. Lothrop is the bearer of this and can give 
you an Acct. of us. The Inhabitants of Boston are on the move. 
H[ancock] and A[dams] go no more into that Garrison, the 
female Connections of the first come out early this morning and 
measures are taken relative to those of the last. The moving of the 
Inhabitants of Boston if effected will be one grand Move. I hope 
one thing will follow another till America shall appear Grand to 
all the world. I begin to think of the Trunks which may be ready 
against I come home, we perhaps may be forced to move: if we

Christian resignation and phylosophick Dignity. God has given 
you .great abilities; you have improved them in great Acquire 
ments. You are possessd of eminent Virtues and distinguished 
Piety. For all these I esteem I love you in a degree that I can t 
express. They are all now to be called into action for the good of 
Mankind, for the good of your friends, for the promotion of Virtue 
and Patriotism. Don t let the fluttering of your Heart interrupt 
your Health or disturb your repose. Believe me I am continually 
Anxious about you. Ride when the weather is good and don t work

well? She can t forget me or have any Objections to writing. 

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 

WATERTOWN, May 7, 1775. 

MY DEAR SIR, After I had executed my Commission at Provi 
dence, I returned home, set Mrs. Warren down in her own Habita 
tion, made the best provision I could for the security of our Fam 
ily, and some of our Effects, which we considered to be not very 
safe at Plymouth, and immediately hastened to this place, to con 
tribute my Mite to the publick Service in this Exigence of Affairs. 
Here I have been near a week, every day resolving to write to you, 
without beginning to execute such a resolution till now. And 
indeed every thing seems to be in such Confusion, that I hardly 
know where to begin, and perhaps shall be at as great a Loss to 
know where to end. I find our own Body extreamly weakened by 
the several detachments (to use the stile of the Times) made from 
it. When I see the Seats of many of my Friends on whom I used 
to place my principal dependance empty, and feel the want of 
them as I do, at a Time when they are more wanted than ever, 
I am almost discouraged. However as I was born to struggle with 
difficulties, [I] shall endeavour to answer the End of my Creation 
as well as I can. The Congress since I have been here has generally 
been full, unanimous and spirited, ready and willing to do every 
thing in their power, and frequently animated by the most agree-

able News from the other Colonies. The principal Objects of our 
Attention have been the regulation and officering of the Army, and 
arming the men, and devising ways and means to support the 
enormous Expence incurred under our present Situation; and 
those I dare say you can easily conceive to be attended with many 
difficulties, under the present Circumstances of our Government, 
in which recommendations are to supply the place of Laws, and 
destitute of coercive power, exposed to the Caprice of the Peo 
ple, and depending entirely on their virtue for Success. We have 
voted to issue Notes for ioo.ooo and to request your aid in giv 
ing them a Currency. 1 The Committee of Ways and Means to sit 
again. We are embarrassed in officering our Army by the Estab 
lishment of Minute Men. 2 I wish it had never taken place, and the 
necessity of having our Field Officers appointed is every day seen, 
and indeed in my Opinion that should have been the first thing 
done. As to the Army, it is in such a shifting, fluctuating state as 
not to be capable of a perfect regulation. They are continually 
going and coming. However, they seem to me to want a more 
experienced direction. I could for myself wish to see your Friends 
Washington and L[ee] 3 at the Head of it, and yet dare not propose 
it, tho I have it in Contemplation. I hope that matter will be 
considered with more propriety in your Body than ours. If you 
establish a Continental Army, of which this will be only a part, 
you will place the direction as you please. It is difficult to say 
what Numbers our Army consists of. If a return could be had one 
day, it would by no means answer for the next. They have been 
so reduced at some times that I have trembled at the Consequences 

i Journals of the Provincial Congress (Mass.), 189. 

^ The term is believed to be derived from a motion made by Col. William Henshaw in a 
meeting of local Committees of Correspondence at Worcester, September 21, 1774, recom 
mending that one-third of the men of the respective towns, between sixteen and sixty years 
of age be inlisted, "to be ready to act at a minute s warning." I Proceedings, xv. 69. The 
Provincial Congress on October 26, provided for such a force which should hold itself in

3 In the light of subsequent events it seems strange that so much credit was given to 
Charles Lee at this time. He made himself active in the cause of the Colonies and his 
Strictures on Dr. Myles Cooper s Friendly Address to all Reasonable Americans, first issued 
at Philadelphia, in 1774, ran through six editions in a few months, two of the issues coming 
from Boston printers. His connections were Southern, rather than New England, and the 
first pressure for his appointment to high command in the army probably came from Vir 
ginia and Maryland. At this time he was in Philadelphia, training raw troops and cultivat 
ing influence in the Continental Congress, which convened May 10.

that might take place. Our new Levies are coming in, and by that 
means I hope they will be in a more permanent state. I believe 
there are about 6,000 in Camp at present. They are employed 
at Cambridge, in heaving up Intrenchments, somewhere about 
Phips Farm. I have not seen them. The extream want of the 
Exercise of a fixt settled Government is sufficiently felt here at 
this time, and has produced the Assignment of a Time to take that 
matter under Consideration. Next Tuesday is the time. 1 What 
will be done I know not. I am inclined to think they will vote to 
assume a Government. But who is to form this Constitution, who 
is to rigg the ship, I can t tell. It appears to me a Business of such 
a nature, so important, and in which an Error once committed, 
will probably be as lasting as the Constitution itself, that I am 
afraid to meddle. It is sufficient for such a genius as mine to know_ 
the places and use of the several ropes after the ship is rigg d. - 
However, we have a Chance. Success is the Criterion that gen 
erally determines the Judgment. If we should either by accident 
or by the force of our great Abilities build up a Grand Constitu 
tion with the same ease we could a Bird Cage, we shall be equally 
clever fellows. If I don t tire your patience now, you shall hear 
more of this in my next. 

The Infatuation of the Inhabitants of Boston has reduced us and 
themselves to the precise state I have expected it would do. We 
have been obliged for their sakes to pass some votes, that we did 
not well relish. We have admitted the refugees to send out for their 
Effects, tho I don t expect any advantage from it. 2 In short I 
voted for it more to gratifie my friend Warren, than from any 
other motive. There is no Guard against the General s Treachery. 
He will find some pretences for the base Arts practiced to abuse 
that People, and will finally keep a large number of them there. 
When he lets them out at all it is very slowly. When the Tories 
and Tory Effects are in, and his Reinforcement arrives, I presume 
no more of them will come out. They are to be pitied, tho this

is the Effect of their own folly. The misery they are already re 
duced to in the Town is great, and may be seen described in the 
Joy of the Countenances of those who get out. By the way I have 
just heard that Edes 1 has stole out. I wish his partner was with 
him. . . . 

I think they go on charmingly and swimmingly at [New] York. 

Inclosed are a Letter from Mrs. Adams, and an Extract of a 
Letter from Hutchinson, found among a curious Collection of 
Letters now in the hands of our Friends. 2 I am well assured of the 
Authenticity of it, and send this particular Extract more because 
it seems to be especially calculated to be used where you are 
than because it shews a greater degree of Wickedness than many 
others. 

JAMES WARREN TO MERCY WARREN 

WATER-TOWN, May 18, 1775 

MY DEAR MERCY, What a Letter every day! Was ever a 
Woman doom d to such drudgery before to be obliged to read half 
a Sheet, and some times a whole one, full of Impertinence before 
dinner, is enough at least to take away one s Appetite; but you see 
I presume my wife will not complain or scold in this way, her Love 
for reading, or affection for her Husband will secure a welcome to 
his Scribbles. I had not your Letter when I wrote yesterday. You 
must not look for me too soon. If I do not get home on Thursday, 
hope I shall on Saturday or Sunday depend on it as soon as I 
can. In the mean Time you will digest a System of politics, for I 
find you in that strain. But remember to revere our Congress, for 
if we have lost many good Members we have many left; and, if we

have not all the Sense and property of the province among us, we 
have as good a Share as commonly is in such an Assembly, it will 
no longer therefore do to delay a question that should have been 
determined 6 months ago. Nevertheless we have gone no further 
than an application to the Grand Congress. There is a degree of 
Timidity and slowness in our movements which my Soul abom 
inates. As soon as South Carolina got the rumour of the action 
here, and an uncertain one too, they took Immediate possession 
of all the Arms and Stores belonging to the King there, drove the 
Men on Board the Ships and sware they shall no more set foot on 
shore there. At Hallifax they burnt all the Hay which Genl. Gage 
depended on, and had sent Transports for, and made several At 
tempts to Burn the Magazines and dock Yards. They are resolved 
that no Tory shall come in and reside in that Province, poor Dogs, 
where will they go and what will they do, there is no Country where 
a Sentiment worthy of a Man is Entertained but detests them. 
Turkey or Algiers may do, but their principles and Conduct are not 
Calculated for any part of America. The first part of your Letter 
shew you as cool as a Philosopher or a politician but the last as 
Agitated as a Modern Soldier. Oh, the horrors of a reinforce 
ment! Let me tell you a Story. Last Saturday 1 our Troops at 
Cambridge took into their heads to March to Charlestown. Ac 
cordingly about 4000 marched down in very good order, with a 
Genl. 2 at their head. This movement produced a Terror in Boston 
hardly to be described. You may have an Idea of it if I tell you 
that the Genl. once gave orders to have the Guns at the Castle 
spiked up, but on a little recollection and some remonstrances from 
one of his Colonels recoverd himself and revoked his Orders. Let 
your Colonel s remonstrances etc. have a Similar Effect. My cold is 
almost well, be not Concerned for me, take care of yourself and I 
hope we shall both do well. The Blessing of heaven rest on you is 
the daily Prayer of your Affect Husband,

PHYLADELPHIA, May 21, 1775 

MY DEAR FRIEND, I am vastly obliged to you for your Let 
ter. It was like cold Water to a thirsty Soul. We suffer, greatly for 
Want of News from you and Boston. 

I am very unfortunate in my Eyes and my Health. I came from 
Home Sick and have been so ever Since. My Eyes are so weak and 
dim that I can neither read, write, or see without great Pain. 

Our unwieldy Body moves very slow. We shall do something in 
Time, but must have our own Way. We are all secret. But I can 
guess that an army will be posted in New York, and another in 
Massachusetts, at the Continental Expence. 

Such a vast Multitude of Objects, civil, political, commercial 
and military, press and crowd upon us so fast, that We know not 
what to do first. The State of fifteen or sixteen Colonies, to be 
considered, Time must be taken. 

Pray write me by every opportunity and intreat all my Friends 
to do the same every Line from you, any of you does good. 

One half the Group 1 is printed here, from a Copy printed in 
Jamaica. Pray send me a printed Copy of the whole and it will be 
greedily reprinted here. My friendship to the Author of it. 

The Martial Spirit throughout this Province is astonishing, it 
arose all of a Sudden, Since the News of the Battle of Lexington. 
Quakers and all are carried away with it. Every day in the Week 
Sundays not excepted they exercise, in great Numbers. The 
Farmer 2 is a Coll. and Jo. Reed another. Their officers, are made 
of the People of the first Fortune in the Place. 

Uniforms and Regimentals are as thick as Bees. America will soon 
be in a Condition to defend itself by Land against all Mankind.

DR. SIR, The Bearers of this are two young Gentlemen from 
Maryland, of one of the best and first Families in that Province, 
one of them is a Lawyer, the other a Physician; both have inde 
pendent Fortunes. Such is their Zeal in the Cause of America and 
Such their fellow Feeling for the People of our Province, that they 
are determined to Spend the Summer in our Camp in order to 
gain Experience and perfect themselves in the Art military. They 
are Soldiers already. Their Name is Hall. 1 It will be of great Im 
portance that these Gentn should be treated with the utmost 
Delicacy and Politeness; their Letters to their Friends will have a 
great Influence on the Southern Colonies. 

I should take it as a favour if you would introduce these Gen 
tlemen to all our best Friends and to the Knowledge of every 
Thing that can Serve the Cause. 

I can not inform you of any Thing passing here that is worth 
knowing. I hope We shall give Satisfaction. But it must be a work 
of Time. I am your Friend,

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHYLADELPHIA, June 7, 1775 

DEAR SIR, We have been puzzled to discover what we ought 
to do with the Canadians and Indians. Several Persons have been 
before Congress who have lately been in the Province of Canada, 
particularly Mr. Brown 2 and Mr. Price, 3 who have informed us 

1 Heitman gives Edward and Elihu Hall, of Maryland, as holding continental com 
missions. 

2 John Brown, who had brought intelligence of the capture of Ticonderoga. His testi 
mony on the disposition of the Canadians is in the Pennsylvania Packet, May 22, 1775. 

3 The Journals of the Continental Congress, n. 66, record May 27: "Information being 
given that there is a gentleman in town who can give the Congress a full and just account 
of the state of Affairs in Canada; Ordered, that he be introduced, and he was accordingly 
introduced." A letter " To the oppressed Inhabitants of Canada" was prepared and sent to 
Canada "by the gentleman just introduced." Ib., 67, 68. It was translated into French 
and 1000 printed by Fleury Mesplet, at Philadelphia. The Congress printed it also in 
English. On James Price see Codman, Arnold s Expedition to Quebec, 8.

that the French are not unfriendly to us. And by all that we can 
learn of the Indians they intend to be neutral. 

But whether We should march into Canada with an Army Suf 
ficient to break the Power of Governor Carlton, to overawe the 
Indians, and to protect the French, has been a great Question. 1 
It seems to be the general Conclusion that it is best to go, if We 
can be assured that the Canadians will be pleased with it and join. 
The Nations of Indians inhabiting the Frontiers of the Colonies 
are numerous and warlike. They seem disposed to Neutrality. 
None have as yet taken up the Hatchet against us; and We have 
not obtained any certain Evidence that either Carlton or Johnson 
have directly attempted to persuade them to take up the Hatchet. 
Some Suspicious Circumstances there are. 

The Indians are known to conduct their Wars so entirely with 
out Faith and Humanity, that it will bring eternal Infamy on the 
Ministry throughout all Europe if they should excite these Savages 
to War. The French disgraced themselves last War by employing 
them. To let loose these blood Hounds to scalp Men and to butcher 
Women and Children is horrid. Still it [is] Such kind of Humanity 
and Policy as we have experienced from the Ministry. 



JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHYLADELPHIA, June 10, 1775 

DR. SIR, I have written a few lines to Dr. Warren to whom 
I refer you. 

It is of vast Importance that the officers of our Army should be 
impressed with the absolute Necessity of Cleanliness, to preserve 
the Health of their Men. Cleanness is one of the three Cardinal 
Virtues of a Soldier, as Activity and Sobriety are the other two. 
They should be encouraged to go into Water frequently, to keep 
their Linen washed and their Beds clean, and should be continually 
exercised in the manual and Maneuvres. 

General Lee, has an Opinion of Burgoine, Clinton and How. 

I On June I the Continental Congress resolved, "that no expedition or incursion ought 
to be undertaken or made, by any colony, or body of colonists, against or into Canada."

54 Warren- Adams Letters [1775 

Burgoine he says is very active and enterprizing, fond of Sur 
prizes and Night Attacks and Alarms. He entreats me to inculcate 
a most unremitted Vigilance, to guard against Surprizes, specially 
in the Night. 

We have a most miraculous Militia in this City, brought into 
Existence out of Nothing since the Battle of Lexington. Measures 
are taken here and at New York to procure Powder. But we must 
be Sparing of that Article. The Supineness of the Colonies hitherto 
concerning it, amazes me. Genl. Lee and Major Gates are very 
fond of a Project of procuring Pikes and Pike men. 1 I hope we 
shall send you some Rifle Men; they shoot with great Exactness, 
at amazing Distances. 

They are casting Pateraras 2 and making Amuzettes 3 in this 
City, and preparing for War, with an alacrity which does them 
Honor.

DEAR COLL. WARREN, I have been impatiently waiting for 
the Fulfillment of your Promise to write to me, but I can easily 
excuse you knowing that your hands as well as mine must be full 
at this important glorious Crisis. The Battle of Lexington will be 
famed in the History of this Country. Four Accounts of it have 
doubtless by this time reached England. Our insulting Enemies 
there must be convinced that Americans are not such dastardly 
Cowards as a Coll. Grant 4 and others have represented them to 
be, and our Friends have received a sure pledge that we will not 
desert them by deserting ourselves, and leave them to the Con 
tempt of those most contemptible Wretches the King s Ministers. 
Whether the People of England will hereby be brought to reflect 
on their own Danger, or whether their pride will be touchd at this

unexpected and signal Defeat of British Troops is to me uncer 
tain. [If their Resentment should run high against us, our Friends 
will have a political Game to play, to turn the whole Force of that 
Resentment upon the Authors of these Disturbances, viz. Hutch- 
inson and the Ministry. It is however the Duty of America to be 
still upon its Guard, for there is no Dependence to be had on the 
People of England, and I am convinced most abundantly that it is 
the Determination of the K. and his Ministers to establish arbi 
trary Government in the Colonies by Acts of Parliament and to 
enforce those Acts by the Sword. Could the publick Sentiment be 
otherwise it would be a Delusion leading directly to Destruction. 
The Spirit of Patriotism prevails among the Members of this 
Congress but from the Necessity of things Business must go on 
slower than one could wish. It is difficult to possess upwards of 
Sixty Gentlemen, at once with the same Feelings upon Questions 
of Importance that are continually arising. All mean the Defence 
and Support of American Liberty and Matters are finally well 
decided; I have endeavored to Act with that kind of Prudence 
which I dare say, when I shall explain my Conduct to you, you 
will not condemn. 

Mr. Fessenden 1 a Courier from your Congress arrived here 
yesterday. I could not help flattering my Self that your pressing 
Demand was political, but I was much pleasd to see every Gentle 
man present anxiously sollicitious to relieve the Necessities of and 
yield a full Supply to the "American Army before Boston." Our 
worthy President has Communicated to yours a Resolution for 
this purpose. 2 

Every Step is taking here for the procuring of Gunpowder from 
abroad and setting up the Manufacture of it in America and I be 
lieve they will be successfull. 

Mr. Mifflin 3 assures me that large Quantities are expected in 
a few Weeks in this place and 200 Barrels every hour. 

If our Army behave with Spirit this Summer (as I am confident 
they will) and their Efforts are succeeded, I trust in God, we shall 
be superior to all future Difficulty. Be cautious of the enterprising

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 

WATERTOWN, June n, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, Since my last I have waited with Impatience 
to hear from you. I mean individually. The public Expectation to 
hear from the Congress is great. They don t complain, but they 
wonder that the Congress should sit a month without their receiv 
ing something decisive with regard to us. I presume we shall have 
it in due time; at least that nothing will be wanting in your power 
to relieve the distresses of your Country. I intended to have de 
voted some part of this Day to write to you, but have been di 
verted by Calls that I could not dispence with. Since I knew of this 
Opportunity I have not been able to get a minute till now when the 
Express is just going off. You will collect from the publick Letter 
by this Express our Sentiments with regard to the necessity of 
assuming civil Government constantly increasing upon us; what 
we apprehend to be the strength of our Enemies, and what have 
been and still are the subjects of some of our Contemplations. 
I have not time to add any thing more with regard to our proceed 
ings or the state of the Army. I can only say we have difficulties 
enough to struggle with. I hope we shall do well at last. It is said 
General Howe gives out that he intends soon to have a frolic with 
the Yankees. They are ready for him, and wish for nothing more. 
Their Grenadiers and Light Infantry have been exempted from 
duty for ten or twelve days. We were greatly elated this morn 
ing with an Account that you had voted 70,000 men, and 3 ,000,000 
sterling to be struck off in Bills for their support. 2 Our Joy was

damped at 10 o clock by a Letter from your Brother Gushing. I 
wish it had miscarried, that I might have enjoyed the pleasure a 
little longer of contemplating the dignity of your Conduct, as well 
as the rising Glory of America. His Letter was dated the 1st. 
Instant; and if he had been in the Clouds for seven years past, I 
think he would have had as just Ideas of our situation and neces 
sities as he has expressed to his Friend Hawley. 1 He thinks a very 
inconsiderable reinforcement is to be expected, and when arrived, 
that Gage will not have more than 5 or 6,000 men, and queries 
whether we had not better discharge part of our Army, to prevent 
involving ourselves in an immense Debt; a hint that we are to 
expect no support from the Continent; but at the same time talks 
of an Union and the Day is ours, as saith Dr. Franklin. . . . 

JOHN HANCOCK TO JOSEPH WARREN 2 

SUNDAY MORNG, 18 June, 1775. PHILADA. 

MY DEAR SIR, I intended writing you a long Letter, but am 
prevented by my Attention to the orders of Congress in Dispatch 
ing an Express and writing to Govr. Trumbull on matters of in 
finite Importance. In short from my Scituation in Congress I 
have great Duty to Do, but I will persevere even to the Destruc 
tion of my Constitution. I am under a strict Injunction not to 
Communicate the Doings of Congress, but two or three Circum 
stances having Taken place in Congress which affected our Army, 
indued me to ask Leave to mention them, which I obtain d with 
this positive Direction that at present they be not mentiond in 
the Newspapers which you will please to observe. 

The Congress have appointed George Washington, Esqr., 
General and Commander in Chief of the Continental Army. His 
Commission is made out and I shall Sign it to morrow. He is a 
Gentleman you will all like. I submit to you the propriety of 
providing a suitable place for his Residence and the mode of his 
Reception. Pray tell Genl. Ward of this with my Respects, and 
that we all Expect to hear that the Military Movements of the

Day of his Arrival will be such as to do him and the Commander 
in Chief great honour. 

General Ward is appointed Second in Command and am sure 
you will Approve this. General Lee is Appointed third in Com 
mand, but have not his Answer, As to the last Appointment. 
I hope it will Turn out well. I say no more on that head. Genl. 
Washington will set out in a few Days. Would it not be proper to 
have a Troop at the Entrance of our Province to escort him down; 
and then the Fort ready to Receive him. Pray do him every hon 
our. 1 By all means have his Commission read at the head of the 
whole Forces. I can t write Genl. Ward; do mention to him my 
hurry and lay your plans well. 

The Congress have also order d Ten Companies of Rifle Men 
from this Province, Maryland and Virginia of 68 Men each prop 
erly officerd, to proceed immediately to join the Army near Bos 
ton. This is a good Step and will be an excellent additional 
Strength to our Army. These are the finest Marksmen in the 
world. They do Execution with their Rifle Guns at an Amazing 
Distance. The Congress have also Determined upon 15,000 Men 
as a Continental Army. The Committee of the whole Congress 
have agreed to Report that Two Million of Dollars be emitted in 
Bills for the Use of the Continent to pay Troops, etc. This is all

JAMES WARREN TO MERCY WARREN 1 

WATERTOWN, June 18, 1775 

MY DEAR MERCY, The Extraordinary Nature of the Events 
which have taken place in the last 48 Hours has Interrupted that 
steady and only Intercourse which the situation of publick affairs 
allows me. the Night before last our Troops possessd themselves 
of a Hill in Charlestown and had time only to heave up an Imper 
fect Breastwork. The regular Troops from the Batterys in Bos 
ton and two Men of War in the Ferryway began early next Morn 
ing a Heavy Fire on them which was Continued till about Noon, 
when they Landed a large Number of Troops and after a Stout 
resistance and great Loss on their side dispossessed our Men, who 
with the Accumulated disadvantages of being Exposed to the fire 
of their Cannon and the want of Ammunition and not being sup 
ported by fresh Troops were obliged to abandon the Town and 
retire to our Lines towards Cambridge, to which they made a very 
handsome Addition last Night. With a Savage Barbarity never 
practised among Civilized Nations, they fired and have Utterly 
destroyed the Town of Charlestown. We have had this day at 
Dinner another Alarm that they were Advancing on our Lines, 
after having reinforced their Troops with their Horse, etc., and 
that they were out at Roxbury. We expected this would have been 
an Important day. They are reinforced but have not Advanced. 
So things remain at present as they were. We have killed them 
many Men and have killed and wounded about an hundred by 
the best Accounts I can get, among the first of which to our inex 
pressible Grief is my Friend Doctor Warren who was killd it is sup 
posed in the Lines on the Hill at Charlestown in a Manner more 
Glorious to himself than the fate of Wolfe on the plains of Abra 
ham. Many other officers are wounded and some killd. It is Im 
possible to describe the Confusion in this place, Women and Chil 
dren flying into the Country, armed Men Going to the field, and 
wounded Men returning from there fill the Streets. I shant 
Attempt a description. Your Brother 2 borrowed a Gun, etc., and

thing we can wish. Dr. Church, retd. last Evening and Brot. reso

to recommend the Assumption of new forms of Govt. to all the 
Colonies. I wish I could be more perticular. I am now in a Com 
mittee of Importance and only steal time to add Sentences sepe- 
rately. I feel for my Dear Wife, least her Apprehensions should 
hurt her health, be not concerned about me, take care of your Self, 
you can secure a retreat and have proper Notice in Season, and if 
you are safe and the Boys I shall be happy fall what will to my 
Interest. I cant be willing you should come into this part of the 
Country at present. I will see you as soon as possible; can t say 
when. The mode of Govt prescribd is according to the last 
Charter. Some are quite satisfied with it, you know I wishd for a 
more perfect one, it is now Monday Morning. I hear nothing yet 
but the roaring of Cannon below, but no Body regards them. I 
need not say that I long to see you, perhaps never more in my life. 
I shall try hard for it this week. I hope your Strawberries are well 
taken care of and that you have fine feasting on them. Your 
Brother is waiting for Freeman, 2 who with all his patriotism has 
left us for 10 days. I have Letters from both Mr Adams and Cush-

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHYLADELPHIA, June 20, 1775 

MY FRIEND, This Letter will go by the Sage, brave and amiable 
General Washington, to whom I have taken the Liberty of men 
tioning your Name. 

The Congress has at last voted near twenty thousand Men in 
Massachusetts and New York, and an Emission of a Continental 
Currency to maintain them. 

You will have Lee, as third in Command, Ward being the Sec 
ond, Schuyler of New York the fourth, and Putnam the fifth. 
Ten Companies of Rifle Men, too, are ordered from Pennsylvania, 
Maryland and Virginia. 

Nothing has given me more Torment, than the Scuffle We have 
had in appointing the General Officers. We could not obtain a 
Vote upon our seat for L[ee]. Sam and John fought for him, how 
ever, through all the Weapons. Dismal Bugbears were raised. 
There were Prejudices enough among the weak and fears enough 
among the timid, as well as other obstacles from the Cunning: but 
the great Necessity for officers of skill and Experience, prevailed. 
I have never formed any Friendship or particular Connection with 
Lee, but upon the most mature Deliberation I judged him the best 
qualified for the Service and the most likely to connect the Col 
onies, and therefore gave him my Vote, and am willing to abide 
the Consequences. 

I am much obliged to you for yours of June 1 1. Pray write me 
a State of the Army, their Numbers, and a List of the officers and 
the Condition of the poor People of Boston. My Heart bleeds for 
them. 



62 Warren-Adams Letters [1775 

We have a great Show this Morning here. Our great Generals 
Washington and Lee review the three battalions of this City. I 
believe there never was two thousand Soldiers created out of noth 
ing so suddenly, as in this City, you would be surprized to behold 
them, all in Uniforms, and very expert both in the Manual and 4 
Maneuvres. They go through the wheelings and Firings in sub 
divisions, grand Divisions, and Platoons, with great Exactness, 
our Accounts from all Parts of the Continent are very pleasing, 
the Spirit of the People is such as you would wish. 

I hope to be nearer to you at least, very soon. How does your 
Government go on ? If We have more bad News from England the 
other Colonies will follow your Example. 

My Love to all Friends. Yours, 

JOHN ADAMS 

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
WATERTOWN, June 20, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, Since my last I have the pleasure of several of 
yours. I am extreamly obliged to you, and to continue your atten 
tion to me in this way can assure you I don t fail to make use 
of any thing I think will serve the publick from your Letters. I 
communicated to both our Generals that paragraph of your Letter 
containing General Lee s opinion of the Generals and character 
particularly of Burgoine. Yours per Mr. Hall I never received 
till the day before .yesterday. I have never seen those Gentlemen; 
shall observe your recommendation when I do. You will doubtless 
hear before this reaches you of another Action here on Saturday 
last, which terminated with less success on our side than any one 
that has taken place before. However, they have nothing to 
boast of but the possession of the Ground. You will say that is 
enough. It is enough to mark with Infamy those who suffered it; 
but they have paid very dearly for it, in the loss of many men. 
They landed about 2000. I can t learn who commanded them. 
Were more than repulsed by the Bravery of our men in the imper 
fect Lines hove up the Night before, who, had they been supplied 
with Ammunition, and a small reinforcement of fresh men, would,

tho under every disadvantage have in all probability cut them to 
pieces. Here fell our worthy and much lamented Friend Doctor 
Warren, with as much Glory as Wolf on the Plains of Abraham, 
after performing many feats of Bravery and exhibiting a Coolness 
and Conduct which did Honour to the Judgment of his Country 
in appointing him a few days before one of their Major Generals. 
At once admired and lamented in such a manner as to make it 
difficult to determine whether regret or envy predominated. Had 
our brave men, posted on Ground injudiciously at first taken, had 
a Lee or a Washington instead of a General destitute of all mili 
tary Ability x and Spirit to command them, it is my Opinion the day 
would have terminated with as much Glory to America as the iQth 
of April. This is our great Misfortune, and is remediless from any 
other quarter than yours. We dare not superceed him here; it will 
come well from you, and really merits your attention. That and 
a necessary article which makes me tremble to name or think of is 
all we want. Our men were harrassed all the morning by Cannon 
from 2 Batteries, 2 Ships, and a Bomb Battery, and at the Attack 
by a great number of armed Boats, and nevertheless made a stout 
resistance. Some fatality always attends my Attempts to write you. 
I am called away and fear I shan t be able to add another paragraph. 
I must beg you would make my Acknowledgments to Mr. Gush 
ing and my good Friend Mr. Adams for their kind favours. I fully 
designed to have wrote them, but this Express goes off so suddenly 
as not to give me an Opportunity. Shall embrace the next as well 
as to enlarge to you. The Hurry of our Affairs can hardly be de 
scribed. We have just received an Account by a Man who is said 
to have swam out of Boston, that we killed and wounded 1000 of 
them, among the first of which is a General, Majors Sherrif and 
Pitcairn and 60 other officers. 70 officers wounded. The whole of 
the Troops landed at Charlestown were 5000. This Account is 
not improbable to me, but I cannot warrant the Authenticity of 
it. I am your Friend. Adieu. 

J. WARREN 

Mrs. Adams and family were well when I last heard from them. 
I have had great pleasure in conversing with Doctor Church who

gives me a good account of your Spirit, Unanimity, etc. I am well 
pleased with most of your resolves. I can t however say that I 
admire the form of Government prescribed. But we are all Sub 
mission and are sending out our Letters for calling an Assembly. 
I hope we shall have as good an opportunity for a good Govern- 
ment in some future time. 

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JOSEPH WARREN 1 

PHILADA., June [20], 1775 

DEAR SIR, I have but one Moment to inform you that this 
Congress, having as I before wrote you appointed General Washing 
ton to the Command of all the American Forces, and Majors Gen 
eral Ward and Lee, they yesterday proceeded to the appointment 
of two more Majors General, viz. Schuyler and Putnam. General 
Lee has accepted of his appointment and will I suppose tomorrow 
set off with General Washington for Cambridge. The Congress 
seems determined to support their Army before Boston. They are 
fully sensible of the Importance of it and have recommended to 
the Colonies of Connecticutt, R. Island and N. Hampshire to send 
the Troops they have agreed to raise without Delay to Cambridge, 
there to remain till further Orders (excepting such as were destined 
to the several Posts in the Colony of N. York.) 2 

You have doubtless been informed by Mr. H[ancock] that you 
may soon expect ten Companies of Rifle men to joyn the Army. 

I am more and more satisfied in the Appointment of General 
Lee. He is certainly an able officer and I think deeply embarked 
in the American Cause. The Congress have agreed to indemnify 
him from any loss of Property he may sustain by acting as an 
officer in the Army, but this I mention only to you at present and 
the small Circle. If any should be disaffected to his Appointment, 
pray use your utmost Endeavor to reconcile them to it. I am in 
great Haste, Your assured friend,

JOHN ADAMS TO JOSEPH WARREN l 

PHYLADELPHIA, June 21, 1775 

DR. SIR, This Letter I presume will be delivered into your 
own Hand by the General. He proposes to set out, tomorrow, for 
your Camp. God speed him. Lee is Second Major General, 
Schuyler who is to command at N. York is the third and Putnam 
the fourth. How many Brigadiers general we shall have, whether 
five, seven or eight, is not determined, nor who they shall be. One 
from N. Hampshire, one from R. Island, two from Connecticutt 
one from N. York, and three from Massachusetts, perhaps. 

I am almost impatient to be at Cambridge. We shall maintain 
a good Army for you. I expect to hear of Grumbletonians, some 
from parsimonious and others from Superstitious Prejudices. 
But we do the best we can, and leave the Event. 

How do you like your Government? Does it make or remove 
Difficulties? I wish We were nearer to you. 

The Tories lie very low both here and at New York. The latter 
will very soon be as deep as any Colony. 

We have Major Skeene 2 a Prisoner, enlarged a little on his 
Parol, a very great Tool. I hope Govr. Tryon 3 will be taken care 
of. But We find a great many Bundles of weak Nerves. We are 
obliged to be as delicate and soft and modest and humble as possible. 

Pray stir up every Man, who has a Quill to write me. We want 
to know the Number of your Army, a List of your officers, a State 
of your Government, the Distresses of Boston, the Condition of 
the Enemy, etc. I am, Dr Sir, your Friend,

We have all recommended Billy Tudor 4 for a Secretary to the 
General. Will he make a good one?

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHYLADELPHIA, June 27, 1775 

MY DEAR FRIEND, I am extremely obliged to you for your 
Favour of the 2Oth of June. The last Fall I had a great many 
Friends who kept me continually well informed of every Event 
as it occurred: But this Time I have lost all my Friends, excepting 
Coll. Warren of Plymouth, and Coll. Palmer of Braintree, and my 
Wife. 

Our dear Warren has fallen, with Laurells on his Brows as fresh 
and blooming as ever graced an Hero. 

I have suffered infinitely this Time, from ill Health and blind 
Eyes at a Time when a vast Variety of great Objects were crowd 
ing upon my Mind, and when my dear Country was suffering all 
the Calamities of Famine, Pestilence, Fire, and Sword at once. 

At this Congress we do as well as we can. I must leave it to 
some future opportunity, which I have a charming Confidence will 
certainly come to inform you fully of the History of our Debates 
and Resolutions. 

Last Saturday night at Eleven o clock an Express arrived from 
the worthy Govr Trumbull informing of the Battle of Charlestown. 
An hundred Gentlemen flocked to our Lodgings to hear the News. 
At one o Clock Mr H[ancock] Mr A[dams] and myself went out to 
enquire after the Committee of this City, in order to beg some 
Powder. We found Some of them, and these with great Politeness 
and Sympathy for their brave Brethren in the Mass, agreed to go 
that night and send forward about Ninety Quarter Casks and be 
fore Morning it was in Motion. Between two and three o Clock I 
got to bed. 

We are contriving every Way we can think of to get you Powder. 
We have a Number of Plans for making Salt Petre and Gentle 
men here are very confident that we shall be able to furnish Salt 
Petre and Powder of our own Manufacture, and that very Soon. 
A Method of making it will be published very soon by one of our 
Committees. 1

Whiting, by Benjamin Edes.

Before this reaches you, Gen. Washington, Lee, etc., will arrive 
among you. I wish to God, you had been appointed a General 
Officer in the Room of some others. Adams and Adams strove to 
get it done. But, Notions, narrow Notions prevented it not 
dislike to you, but fear of disobliging Pomroy, 1 and his Friends. 

Your Govt. was the best We could obtain for you. We have 
passed some Resolutions concerning North Carolina which will 
do a great deal of good. 2 We have allowed them to raise 1000 Men, 
and to take Care of Traytors, if necessary. This must be kept secret. 

We are sending you Ten Companies of Rifle Men. These, if the 
Gentlemen of the Southern Colonies are not very partial and much 
mistaken, are very fine fellows. They are the most accurate Marks 
men in the World; they kill with great Exactness at 200 yards 
Distance; they have Sworn certain death to the ministerial offi 
cers. May they perform their oath. 

You will soon find that the Continental Congress are in, deep 
enough. The Commissions to the officers of the Army; the Vote for 
your Government; the Votes about North Carolina; and a Multi 
tude of other Votes which you will soon hear of will convince you. 

I have inclosed you a hint about salt Petre. Germans and others 
here have an opinion that every stable, Dove house, Cellar, Vault, 
etc., is a Mine of salt Petre. The inclosed Proclamation, coincides 
with this opinion. The Mould under stables, etc., may be boiled 
soon into salt Petre it is said. Numbers are about it here.

WATERTOWN, June 27, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, I feel great reluctance in suffering any op 
portunity to pass without writing to you. I can easily suppose your 
anxiety as well as curiosity make you sollicitous to hear every thing 
that passes here. 

Since my last nothing material has taken place. The military 
operations have consisted in a few movements, and a few shot ex 
changed with very little effect, sometimes on the side of Roxbury, 

I Seth Pomroy (1706-1777). 2 Journals of the Continental Congress, HI. 107. 



68 Warren- Adams Letters [1775 

and sometimes on the side of Charlestown. Our army have taken 
every precaution in their power for their defence, and future opera 
tions. They are heaving up lines from Charles to Mystick River 
and have them in great forwardness. They are carried across 
Temple s farm, and his beautiful groves of locusts have fallen a 
sacrifice to the necessity of the times. At Roxbury they have 
fortified themselves in a manner almost as impregnable as Gage has 
done in Boston. We want but one article to enable us to act of 
fensively, and make a vigorous campaign. Men in fine spirits, well 
provided with every thing but the one I mention. The Generals 
appointed give us great satisfaction, especially the first and the 
third, whose characters have for a great while been such as to fix 
our esteem and confidence. Your attention must be fixed on the 
article of powder, or I will say no more. I can t but hope you 
will make some suitable provision for our General Thomas. 1 His 
merits in the military way have surprised us all. I can t describe 
to you the odds between the two camps. While one has been 
spiritless, sluggish, confused and dirty, I mean where General Put 
nam and our Friend Warren s influence have not had their effects; 
the other has been spirited, active, regular and clean. He has ap 
peared with the dignity and abilities of a General. 

We have no intercourse with Boston, get no intelligence from 
there but by those who steal out. From them we have certain ac 
counts of the amazing slaughter made in the last action. Their 
men die of the slightest wounds, owing to the manner of living 
they are reduced to, so there will in the end be but little odds be 
tween being killed or wounded, and we may return perhaps 14 or 
1500 killed. I am told General Howe says the army shall not re 
turn to Boston but by the way of Roxbury. A very pretty march. 
It is with confidence said that Burgoine has not been seen since 
the action, and it is given out that he is gone home. We are not 
without our hopes that we shall have little trouble from his enter 
prising genius. With regard to us, we are as busy as you ever saw 
pismires on a mole hill. Our attention is principally fixed on the

relieve us. ... T , 17

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, June 28, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, I have received your Letter of the 21 Instant 
and am beyond Measure rejoycd at the tryed Bravery of the 
American Troops in Charlestown. I hope speedily to receive a 
particular and exact Account of the killed and wounded on both 
sides. If the List on the side of the ministerial Army comes near 
to 1000, as seems to be the general opinion it may cool the Courage 
of the three Generals lately arrivd ; 1 of the Courage of Gage I have 
been taught to entertain no Opinion. 

I find by the Letters from our Friends that a Suspicion prevails 
of the Courage, Activity, or military Knowledge of some of our 
Generals. But, my dear Sir, take Care lest Suspicions be carried 
to a dangerous Length. Our Army have behavd valiantly. There 
may have been an Error; but that Error may have proceeded not 
from a Want of Spirit but a Want of Judgment. We have appointed 
the Generals you ask for. Preserve that Union upon which every 
thing we wish for depends. The Experience of Washington and 
Lee may make good all Deficiencies. Why should any of our 
Friends hesitate about the propriety of giving a Command to 
Genl. Lee? 2 He was not born an American, but he has heartily 

1 Howe, Burgoyne and Clinton. 

2 "I feel very, very happy in being able to give you assurances that will relieve an 
anxiety that I discover in your letter. You may rely on it, no suspicions, no uneasiness 
prevails at all with regard to our old generals, and everybody seems to be perfectly satisfied 
with the appointment of the new ones. I mean Washington and Lee. I have not heard a 
single objection to the last of them. ... I know not what to say of your friend Lee. I believe 
he is a soldier, and a very industrious, active one; he came in just before dinner, drank some 
punch, said he wanted no dinner, took no notice of the company, mounted his horse, and 
went off again to the lines. I admire the soldier, but think civility, or even politeness not 
incompatible with his character. But this inter nos. I shall take care to speak highly of him 
on all occasions." James Warren to Samuel Adams, July 9, 1775. In Wells, Life of Samuel

espoused the Cause of America and abhors the oppressive Measures 
of the British Government against America. Prince Eugene, if I 
mistake not was a Frenchman 1 but he was a Scourge to France, 
and Marshall Saxe would have been equally, perhaps more so, if 
Great Britain had not foolishly slighted his offered Service. Ad 
mitting his Integrity, of which I cannot doubt, I think the sound 
Policy of appointing General Lee is evident, other English officers 
may from hence be assured that if they will afford a sufficient 
Pledge of their Merit they may have the Opportunity of distin 
guishing their Valor in the Cause of Liberty in America. So desirous 
was the Congress, that this Country should avail itself of the Abili 
ties of Lee that they have voted to indemnify him for the Loss of 
property he may incur by engaging in this Service to the amount of 
i 1,000 sterling, being the Estimate of his Estate in England, as 
soon as it shall be made to appear that such loss or any part of it 
hath happend. 

This I think interests him strongly, and I mention it by no 
means that it should be made publick, for I think that would be 
imprudent, but to induce our Circle of Friends with the greater 
Cheerfulness to reconcile his Appointment to any, if such there be, 
who have any Scruples about it. 

I sincerely lament the Loss of our truly amiable and worthy 
Friend Dr. Warren. There has scarcely if ever been a Cause so 
evidently just as that in which he fell so gloriously. 

Pray write to me by every Opportunity. I have not time to en 
large or even to correct what I have written. Adieu my Friend.

MERCY WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
WATERTOWN, July 5, 1775 

DEAR SIR, I have had the pleasure of seeing several of your 
letters in which you complain that your friends are rather remiss 
with regard to writing you, which I think inexcusable at a time 
when the liberties of all America and the fate of the British Em 
pire depends in a great measure on the result of your deliberations. 
For if that respectable body of which you are a member fails, 
either from want of early intelligence or from any other cause at 
this important crisis, to pursue the wisest measures, what but in 
evitable destruction to this country must follow. 

Could I have hoped it was in my power to give you either pleas 
ure or intelligence, I should long ere this have taken up my pen, 
and added one more to the triumvirate of your friends. For be 
assured there are very few who can with more sincerity subscribe 
their names to the list. But as I write in compliance with Mr. 
Warren s request, I must tell you his application to public affairs 
leaves him little time to attend to the demands of private friend 
ship. And could you look into a certain Assembly you would not 
wonder that his time is wholly engrossed, or that we ardently wish 
you may soon be here to assist in the public counsels of your own 
distressed Province. 

I shall not attempt to give you a description of the ten fold 
difficulties that surround us. You have doubtless had it from bet 
ter hands. Yet I cannot forbear to drop a tear over the inhabitants 
of our capital, most of them sent naked from the city to seek a 
retreat in the villages, and to cast themselves on the chanty of 
the first hospitable hand that will receive them. Those who are 
left behind are exposed to the daily insults of a foe lost to that sense 
of honour, freedom and valour, once the characteristic of Britons, 
and even of the generosity and humanity which has long been the 
boast of all civilized nations. And while the plagues of famine, 
pestilence and tyranny reign within the walls, the sword is lifted 
without, and the artillery of war continually thundering in our 
ears.

miserable by the depredations of the once formidable navy of 
Britain, now degraded to a level with the corsairs of Barbary. 

At the same time they are piratically plundering the Isles, and 
pilfering the borders to feed the swarms of veteran slaves shut up 
in the town. They will not suffer a poor fisherman to cast his hook 
in the ocean to bring a little relief to the hungry inhabitants with 
out the pitiful bribe of a dollar each to the use of Admiral Greaves. 

The venal system of administration appears to the astonishment 
of every good man in the corruption, duplicity and meanness, 
which run through every department, and while the faithless Gage 
will be marked with infamy for breach of promise, by the impartial 
historian, will not the unhappy Bo-stonians be reproached with 
want of spirit in putting it out of their own power to resent re 
peated injuries by giving these arms into the hand, which would 
have been better placed in the heart of a tyrant. 

And now they are forbidden even to look out from their own 
house tops when he sends out his ruffians l to butcher their breth 
ren, and wrap in flames the neighbouring towns. But I think this 
advertisement was as great a mark of timidity as the transaction 
was of a savage ferocity. 2 The laws of gratitude surely demanded 
that they should spare that town at least whose inhabitants from 
a principle of humanity saved the routed troops of George the 
Third from total destruction after the battle of Lexington. 

But nothing that has taken place is more regretted than the 
death of your friend, the brave, the humane, the good Dr. Warren. 

And though he fell covered with laurels and the wing of fame is 
spread over his monument, we are almost led to enquire why the 
useful, the virtuous patriot is cut off ere he reaches the meridian of 
his days, while the grey headed delinquent totters under the weight 
of accumulated guilt, and counting up his scores, is still adding 
crime to crime, till all mankind detest the hoary wretch, yet suffer 
him to live, to trifle with the rights of society, and to sport with 
the miseries of man. 

The people here are universally pleased with the appointment of 
Generals Washington and Lee. I hope the delegates of the united 
Colonies will continue to act with dignity to themselves, and in a 

i This may be Russians. 2 See Adams, Familiar Letters, 74.

manner which will promote the glory, virtue and happiness of 
America. Let not the indiscreet nor the sanguinary conduct of any 
individual damp the ardor of such as are ready to fly to our assist 
ance and generously to sacrifice the enjoyments of domestic life in 
support of freedom, and the inherent rights of their fellow men.. 

Your friend Dr. Cooper has just informed me that Dr. Eliot is 
confined on board a man of war, 1 and several of the inhabitants of 
Boston imprisoned. The crime of the first was the praying for 
Congresses, Continental and Provincial, and that of others was 
wishing success to American army. 

Sad reflections on the times into which we are fallen crowd fast 
upon my mind; but I will no longer call off your attention from 
most important matters by expressing them. . . .

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHYLADELPHIA, June [July] 6th, 1775 

DEAR SIR, Every Line I receive from you gives me great Pleas 
ure and is of vast Use to me in the public Cause. Your Letters were 
very usefull to me last Fall. Your Character became then known 
and much esteemed. The few Letters I have reed from you this 
Time, have increased the Desire of more, and some other Gentle 
men who happened to know you, particularly Governor Hopkins 2 
and Ward 3 of Rhode Island, have confirmed every good opinion 
which had been formed. I must intreat you to omit no Opportu 
nity of Writing and to be as particular as possible. 

Want of frequent Communication and particular Intelligence 
led us into the unfortunate Arrangement of General Officers which 
is likely to do so much Hurt. /We never reed the most distant In 
timation of any Design to new model your Army; and indeed Some 
of us were obliged to give up our own Judgments merely from Re 
spect to what We took to be the Arrangement of our provincial 
Congress. I have made it my Business ever since I heard of this 
Error to wait upon Gentn. of the Congress at their Lodgings and 

1 Andrew Eliot (1718-1778), pastor of the New North Church in Boston. He was 
not thus confined.

elsewhere to let them into the Secret and contrive a Way to get 
out of the Difficulty, which I hope we shall effect. 

I rejoice to hear of the great military Virtues and Abilities of 
General Thomas. 

Alas poor Warren! Dulce et decorum est pro P atria mori. Yet I 
regret his Appointment to such a Command. For God s Sake my 
Friend let us be upon our Guard, against too much Admiration of 
our greatest Friends. President of the Congress, Chairman of the 
Committee of Safety, Major General and Chief Surgeon of the 
Army, was too much for Mortal, and This Accumulation of Admira 
tion upon one Gentleman, which among the Hebrews was called 
Idolatry, has deprived us forever of the Services of one of our best 
and ablest Men. We have not a sufficient Number of such Men 
left to be prodigal of their Lives in future. 

Every Brain is at Work to get Powder and salt-Petre, I hope 
We shall succeed, but We must be very Oeconomical of that Ar 
ticle. We must not use large Cannon if We can possibly avoid it. 

This Letter will go by two fighting Quakers. Mr. Stephen Col 
lins 1 and Mr. John Kaighn [Keays]. The first is the most hospitable 
benevolent Man alive. He is a Native of Lynn, a brother of Ezra 
Collins 2 of Boston and is rich, and usefull here. The last has been 
the Instrument of raising a Quaker Company in this City, who be 
have well and look beautifully in their Uniforms. My Love, Duty, 
Respects etc. where due. Adieu.

Secret and Confidential, as the Saying is. 

The Congress is not yet so much alarmed as it ought to be. 
There are still hopes, that Ministry and Parliament, will immedi 
ately recced as soon as they hear of the Battle of Lexington, the 
Spirit of New York and Phyladelphia, the Permanency of the 
Union of the Colonies etc. : I think they are much deceived and 
that we shall have nothing but Deceit and Hostility, Fire, Famine, 
Pestilence and Sword from Administration and Parliament. Yet 
the Colonies like all Bodies of Men must and will have their Way 
and their Humour, and even their Whims. 

These opinions of Some Colonies which are founded I think

in their Wishes and passions, their Hopes and Fears, rather than 
in Reason and Evidence will give a whimsical Cast to the Pro 
ceedings of this Congress. You will see a strange Oscillation be 
tween love and hatred, between War and Peace Preparations 
for War and Negociations for Peace. We must have a Petition 
to the King 1 and a delicate Proposal of Negociation, etc. This 
Negociation I dread like Death: But it must be proposed. We 
cant avoid it. Discord and total Disunion would be the certain 
Effect of a resolute Refusal to petition and negociate. My 
Hopes are that Ministry will be afraid of Negociation as well as 
We and therefore refuse it. If they agree to it, We shall have 
Occasion for all our Wit Vigilance and Virtue to avoid being de 
ceived, wheedled threatened or bribed out of our Freedom. If we 
Strenuously insist upon our Liberties, as I hope and am pretty 
sure We shall however, a Negotiation, if agreed to, will terminate 
in Nothing, it will effect nothing. We may possibly gain Time and 
Powder and Arms. 

You will see an Address to the People of G. Britain, 2 another to 
those of Ireland, 3 and another to Jamaica. 4 

You will also see a Spirited Manifesto. 5 We ought immediately 
to dissolve all Ministerial Tyrannies, and Custom houses, set up 
Governments of our own, like that of Connecticutt in all the Col 
onies, confederate together like an indissoluble Band, for mutual 
defence, and open our Ports to all Nations immediately. This is 
the system that your Friend has arrived at promoting from first to 
last: But the Colonies are not yet ripe for it a Bill of Attainder, 
etc., may soon ripen them.

But I have several Particulars to mention to you which are omit 
ted in that Letter. Ten Companies of expert Riflemen have been 
ordered already from the 3 Colonies of Pennsylvania], M{ary- 
land], and Virginia] 1 some of them have marched under excellent 
officers. We are told by Gentlemen here that these Riflemen are 
Men of Property and Family, some of them of independent 
Fortunes, who go from the purest Motives of Patriotism and 
Benevolence into this service. I hope they will have Justice done 
them and Respect shewn them by our People of every Rank and 
order. I hope also that our People will learn from them the Use 
of that excellent Weapon a Rifled barrelled Gun. 

A few Minutes past, a curious Phenomenon appeared at the 
Door of our Congress a german Hussar, a veteran in the Wars 
in Germany, in his Uniform and on Horseback, a forlorn Cap upon 
his Head, with a Streamer waiving from it half down to his Waist 
band, with a Deaths Head painted in Front, a beautifull Hussar 
Cloak ornamented with Lace and Fringe and Cord of Gold, a 
Scarlet Waist coat under it, with shining yellow metal Buttons, a 
Light Gun strung over his shoulder, and a Turkish Sabre much 
Superior to an high Land broad sword very large and excellently 
fortifyed by his side Holsters and Pistols upon his Horse In 
Short the most warlike and formidable Figure, I ever saw. 2 

He says he has fifty Such Men ready to inlist under him imme 
diately who have been all used to the service as Hussars in Ger 
many, and desirous to ride to Boston immediately in order to see 
Burgoigne s light Horse. This would have a fine Effect upon the 
Germans through the Continent of whom there are Multitudes. 
What will be done is yet uncertain. I should not myself be fond of 
raising many Soldiers out of N. England. But the other Colonies 
are more fond of sending Men than I expected. They have their 
Reasons, some plausible, Some whimsical. They have a Secret

Fear, a Jealousy, that New England will soon be full of Veteran 
Soldiers and at length conceive Designs unfavourable to the other 
Colonies. This may be Justly thought whimsical. But others 
Say, that by engaging their own Gentlemen and Peasants and

necessary that all who shall be sent be respectfully treated. 

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
WATERTOWN, July 7, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, I am much obliged to you for your favours 
by the sage, brave, and amiable General Washington, by Major 
Mifflin, and by the express which came to hand the night before 

/ last. I am much pleased with General Washington. He fully an 
swers the character you have given of him. Major MifBin I have 
not yet found out, tho I am told he was once in the room while 
I was at the General s. I shall take particular care to know him 
soon, perhaps this day, as I am to dine with the General. General 
Lee I have seen but a minute. He appears to me a genius in his 
way; he had the marks about him of having been in the trenches. 

/ I heartily rejoice at the appointment of these two generals, and 
I dare say it will give you pleasure to hear that every body seems 
to be satisfied with it. I have not heard a single word uttered 
against it. This is more than I expected with regard to the second. 
Since their arrival every thing goes well in the army. They are 
quiet, busy, and forming fast to order. Our business lessens upon 
our hands, and we find a great relief from the General s arrival. I 
am told they are very active, etc. You will have a return of the 
army from the General I suppose, who will be able to give it with 
more accuracy than any body. The general estimation of our army 
is about 16 or 17000, ten of which are at Cambridge etc., the re 
mainder at Roxbury. We can t with any certainty determine the 
numbers of the enemy. We suppose from the best grounds we have 
that when the [New] York troops arrive, which are daily expected, 
they will amount to 9,000 at least, perhaps more, including the 
black and white negroes engaged in their service in Boston. The 

V/

battle of Charlestown gave them a great shock. It is now pretty 
certain that near 1500, and chiefly of their best troops, among 
which were about 90 officers, were killed and wounded, about 
looo of which were killed. This is amazing, but I believe true. I 
will endeavour to get and inclose the return exact as we have it. 
Your appointment of the other generals I can t say is so well ap 
proved of. We can t investigate the principle you went on, tho 
I think I can trace an influence that marks some of them. But I 
will say no more on that head; you have enough of it in a letter I. 
wrote in conjunction with H[eath] and G[erry]. The general was 
very sorry and somewhat embarrassed with the neglect of Thomas. 
I am told Heath behaves very well, and is willing to give place to 
him. I am much obliged to you and my friend Adams for thinking 
of me. I am content to move in a small sphere. I expect no dis 
tinction but that of an honest man who has exerted every nerve. 
You and I must be content without a slice from the great pudding 
now on the table. The condition of the poor people of Boston is 
truly miserable. We are told that James Lovel, Master Leach 1 
and others are in gaol for some trifling offences, the last for drink 
ing success to the American army. Their offences may be capital. 
It is reported that Doctors Elliot and Mather 2 are on board a 
man of war. From those circumstances you may form an idea of 
their situation. 

I am very sorry for the trouble given you by your companions 
and eyes. I hope to hear the last are better, if not the first. I am 
much pleased with your doings in general, and the prospects you 
hold up to me. Is it not our duty to pray that the infatuation of 
Britain may last one year more at least. The powder you sent us 
arrived yesterday, and was viewed as it passed with a kind of pleas 
ure I suppose you felt in sending it. The want of that article is the 
only obstacle I have in getting through a project of mine for a 
fleet. I made the motion early in the Sessions, and though op 
posed by Pickering, 3 etc., this is the only reason that prevailed.

fast into the sins, folly and sufferings of our old impolitic and un

with a great slaughter made among them, and with a loss of only

DR SIR, I have just Time to inclose you a Declaration and 
an Address. 2 How you will like them I know not. A Petition was 
sent yesterday by Mr. Richard Penn in one ship and a Duplicate 
goes in another Ship this day. In exchange for these Petitions, 
Declarations and Addresses I suppose We shall receive Bills of 
Attainder and other such like Expressions of Esteem and Kindness. 

This Forenoon has been spent in an Examination of a Mr Kirk- 
land, 3 a worthy Missionary among the Oneida Indians. He was 
very usefull last Winter among all the Six Nations, by interpreting 
and explaining the Proceedings of the Continental Congress and 
by representing the Union and Power of the Colonies as well as 
the Nature of the Dispute. 

The Congress inclines to wait for Despatches from General 
Washington before they make any Alteration in the Rank of the 
Generals, least they should make some other Mistake. But every 
Body is well inclined to place General Thomas in the Stead of 
Pomroy.

HOND AND DR SIR, I have the Pleasure of inclosing you a 
Declaration. Some call it a Manifesto. And We might easily have 
occasioned a Debate of half a Day whether it should be called a 
Declaration or a Manifesto. 

Our Address to the People of Great Britain 1 will find many Ad 
mirers among the Ladies, and fine Gentlemen; but it is not to my 
Taste. Prettynesses, Juvenilities, and much less Puerilities be 
come not a great assembly like this the Representative of a great 
People. 

July 23 We have voted Twenty-two thousand Men for your 
Army. If this is not enough to encounter every Officer and Sol 
dier in the british Army, if they were to send them all from Great 
Britain and Ireland, I am mistaken. 

What will N. England do with such Floods of Paper Money? 
We shall get the Continent nobly in our Debt. We are Striking off 
our Paper Bills in Nine different sorts, some of twenty Dollars, 
some of Eight, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, I. We shall be obliged to strike off 
four Millions of Dollars I fear.

devoutly than any Sunday was ever observed in this City. The

Evening, good Sermons. 

By the way do let our Friend Adams s son 5 be provided for as 
a Surgeon.

WATER-TOWN, July n, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, I wrote you several days ago, and wrote in a 
hurry, expecting the General s express would be along before I 
could finish. But he has been detained, and [I] am told will be on 
his journey this morning. I was much chagrined last evening when 
sitting under a tree by the bridge Fessenden rode up from Phila 
delphia without a single letter for me. He says you complain that 
you have no letters. I have endeavoured to do my part. I expected 
we should have rose before this, 1 and I should have got a range over 
the fields before our election, but I begin to dispair. One thing after 
another continually crowds upon us. The General thinks he should 
have more men. 2 I am of the same opinion. How to get them is 
our difficulty. We are now raising 1700 for the express purpose of 
guarding the sea coasts. The people are so engaged at this busy 
season that the militia, if called, would come with reluctance, and 
tarry but a short time, just long enough to put the camp in con 
fusion. What course we are to take in consequence of an applica 
tion from the General which now only detains us, I know not. I 
could wish to have seen more men from the southward. I always 
forgot to tell you I have seen your letter to Gerry, expressing Mr. 
Gadsden s 3 opinion about fixing out armed vessels and setting up 
for a naval power. I thought it very happy to have so great an 
authority confirming my own sentiments, and having proposed in 
Congress just such a project the beginning of the session, borrowed 
the letter to support it. But yet I have not been able to effect it. 
Pickering and his politics, the want of faith and ardor in Gerry, 
etc., and above all the want of powder has prevented it. The last 
is an objection, though I think it would be like planting corn. Ten 
very good going sloops, from 10 to 16 guns, I am persuaded would 
clear our coasts. What would 40 such be to the Continent. Such a 
determination might make a good figure on your Journals. We 
are all still; not a word of news since my last. The troops were

MY DEAR SIR, I yesterday returned from Plymouth where 
I had opportunity of spending only three or four days, in such a 
scurry of private business as would scarcely admit of a single 
meditation in the calm retirements of the fields. I breakfasted in 
the morning with your sensible and amiable lady. She showed me 
a letter from you. I read it with pleasure. I arrived here about 12 
o clock. You will say a late hour for election day. I found here two 
of your letters, one of them inclosing the two pamphlets, and your 
friend Mr. Collins called upon me this morning and delivered two 
more. I think myself greatly obliged to you for your friendship, 
confidence, and the marks of partiality I meet with in every letter 
I receive from you. I had but an hour s conversation with your 
friend. From the best judgment I can make in so short an ac 
quaintance he is worthy of your friendship. I admire his open 
frankness and judicious observations and sentiments. He has prom-

ised to dine with me tomorrow or next day. Our new Assembly 
met yesterday, and only chose Speaker and clerk, 1 and postponed 
the choice of Councillors till tomorrow morning. I fear with all this 
deliberation we shall not get such a board as will please you. Bos 
ton is the only place to hold election in. I hope the next will be 
there; but if we might do as we would, it is astonishing how few 
sterling men are to be found in so large a Province as this is. I am 
not able to give my opinion of the Pamphlets you sent me, not 
having had time to read them. I was late last evening settling the 
list of Councillors; this morning I had many things to do, and then 
to go to meeting. The Fast is observed here with a strictness and 
devotion that shows the opinion the people have of the authority 
that appointed it, as well as their reverence for him who overrules 
all events, and has so signally appeared in our favour. /So few oc 
currences have taken place since my last in the military way that 
your curiosity will not be sufficiently satisfied with an account of 
them. I will endeavour to recollect them all. The attempt on Long 
Island, 2 the taking off all the stock and afterwards returning to 
burn the buildings (which you will have in the papers,) was cer 
tainly a bold, intrepid manoeuvre, and as such astonished our 
enemies. The barges full of armed men were afraid to attack our 
whale boats, at a proper distance, and the armed vessels, either 
agitated with fear, or destitute of judgment, did it without execu 
tion. The next thing that took place, was the possessing and forti 
fying a post by Brown s House, very near their lines. This has 
been effected with the loss only of one man, and he not employed 
there, tho they worked in open sight of them, and exposed to an 
incessant fire from their cannon, which our people treated with the 
extremest contempt, not so much as once leaving their work, or 
returning a shot. No general movements have taken place. There 
was an appearance of it the day before yesterday on Roxbury side; 
but they did not venture out. General Thomas, who as yet con 
tinued in that command, made an excellent disposition to receive 
them, and was disappointed. Roxbury is amazingly strong. I be 
lieve it would puzzle 10,000 troops to go through it, I mean of the 
best in the world. I am just told that our boats have this day been

to the Lighthouse and burnt it in spite of the firing from a man of 
war and a number of boats. I hear it was executed by 300 Rhode 
Islanders. I don t learn that they suffered any loss. It is said they 
are more afraid of our whale boats than we are of their men of war. 
A few armed vessels, I am abundantly convinced, would produce 
great consequences. I want to see the Riflemen, and should be 
pleased to see the Hussar at the head of his troop. You need not 
fear our treating them with the utmost tenderness and affection. 
There is a strong spirit of love and cordiality for our friends of the 
other colonies prevailing here. The finger of Heaven seems to be in 
every thing. I fear nothing now so much as the small Pox in our 
army. (There is some danger of it,tho I hope it will be stop d), 
and proposals of a conciliatory nature from England. The first 
would be dreadful, but the last more so. I see the difficulties you 
have to struggle against, and the mortification you are obliged to 
submit to. I did not expect another petition. I hope however your 
sentiments and plans will finally prevail. The infatuation of Brit 
ain may supply the firmness of your brethren, and effect what their 
timidity and ridiculous moderation would otherways prevent. If 
the Canadians should relish an army of ours there, as I am told 
they will, I think it would be a grand move. Captain Darby, 1 
who we sent with the account of the battle of the I9th of April, re 
turned two days ago. He was there eight days, and came away 
before Gage s packet arrived. He says trade and the stocks were 
amazingly affected in that short time. Lord Dartmouth sent three 
times for him. He refused to go, and when he threatened him he 
decamped, got on board, and came without either entering or 
clearing. I shall enclose you a letter bro t by him from Sheriff Lee, 2 
and one of the latest papers. By the letter I fancy General Gage 
is to expect no other reinforcement this fall. They are very sickly, 
and are greatly reduced. The Tories in Boston I believe are low 
enough, are bowed down with the load of guilt they have by their

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, July 23d, 1775 

DR. SIR, I have many things to write you which thro. Haste 
and Confusion I fear, I shall forget. 

Upon the Receipt of General Washington s Letter, 2 the Motion 
which I made Some Days before for appointing General Thomas 
first Brigadier was renewed and carried, so that the return of the 
Express will carry his Commission. I hope that this will give all 
the satisfaction which is now to be given. You ask me upon what 
Principle We proceeded in our first Arrangement. I answer upon 
the Principle of an implicit Complyance with the order in which the 
General officers were chosen in our Provincial Congress last Fall. 
Not one of us would have voted for the Generals in the order in 
which the General Officers were chosen in our Provincial Congress 

1 Joseph Reed. 

2 "General Thomas is much esteemed and earnestly desired to continue in the service: 
and as far as my opportunities have enabled me to judge I must join in the general opinion 
that he is an able good officer and his resignation would be a public loss. The postponing 
him to Pomroy and Heath, whom he has commanded, would make his continuance very 
difficult, and probably operate on his mind." Washington to the Continental Congress, 
July 10, 1775. Writings (Ford), in. 15. Congress appointed Thomas "in room of General 
Pomeroy, who rtever acted under the commission sent him," July 19. Journals of the 
Continental Congress, n. 191.

last Fall; Not one of us, would have voted for the Generals in the 
order in which they were placed, if We had not thought that you 
had settled the Rank of every one of them last Fall in Provincial 
Congress and that We were not at Liberty to make any Alteration. 
I would not have been so shackled however, if my Colleagues 
had been of my Mind. 

But, in the Case of the Connecticutt officers, We took a Liberty 
to alter the Rank established by the Colony and by that Means 
made much Uneasiness; so that We were sure to do Mischief 
whether We conformed or deviated from Colony arrangements. 
I rejoice that Thomas had more Wisdom than Spencer 1 or 
Woorster, and that he did not leave the Camp nor talk impru 
dently. If he had we should have lost him from the Continental 
service; for I assure you, Spencer by going off, and Woorster by 
unguarded Speeches have given high offence here, it will cost us 
Pains to prevent their being discarded from the service of the Con 
tinent with Indignation. Gentlemen here had no private Friend 
ships Connections, or Interests which prompted them to vote for 
the arrangement they made but were influenced only by a Regard 
to the Service; and they are determined that their Commissions 
shall not be despised. 

I have read of Times, either in History or Romance, when Great 
Generals would cheerfully serve their Country, as Captains or 
Lieutenants of Single Companies, if the Voice of their Country 
happened not to destine them to an higher Rank; but such exalted 
Ideas of public Virtue seem to be lost out of the World. Enough of 
this. 

I have laboured with my Colleagues to agree upon proper Per 
sons to recommend for a Quarter Master General, a Commissary 
of Musters and a Commissary of Artillery 2 but in vain. The 
Consequence has been that the appointment of these important, 
and lucrative officers is left to the General, against every proper 
Rule and Principle, as these offices are Checks upon his. This is a 
great Misfortune to our Colony; however, I hope that you and 

1 Spencer refused at first to serve under Putnam, but later consented to the arrangement.

Cheever, Commissary of Artillery Stores, August 17.

others, will think of proper Persons and recommend them to the 
General. 

There is, my Friend, in our Colony a great Number of Persons 
well qualified for Places in the Army, who have lost their all, by the 
outrages of Tyranny, whom I wish to hear provided for. Many of 
them will occur to you. I beg leave to mention a few. Henry Knox, 
William Bant 1 young Hichbourne the Lawyer 2 William Tudor, 
and Perez Morton. 3 These are young Gentlemen of Education 
and Accomplishments, in civil Life, as well as good Soldiers; and 
if at this Time initiated into the service of their Country might 
become in Time and with Experience able officers, if they could be 
made Captains or Brigade Majors, or put into some little Places at 
present I am very sure their Country would loose nothing by it, in 
Reputation or otherwise. A certain Delicacy which is necessary 
to a good Character may have prevented their making any ap 
plications, but I know they are desirous of serving. 

I must enjoin Secrecy upon you, in as strong Terms as Mr. 
Hutchinson used to his confidential Correspondents; and then 
confess to you that I never was since my Birth, so compleatly 
miserable as I have been since the Tenth of April. Bad Health, n 
blind eyes, want of Intelligence from our Colony, and aboveji[Lthe 
unfortunate and fatal Divisions, in our own Seat in Congress, 
which have lost us Reputation, as well as many great Advantages 
which We might otherwise have obtained for our Colony have 
made me often envy the active Hero in the Field, who, if he does 
his own Duty, is sure of Applause, tho he falls in the Execution 
of it. 

It is a vast and complicated System of Business which We have 
gone through, and We were all of us unexperienced in it. Many 
Things may be wrong, but no small Proportion of these are to be 
attributed to the Want of Concert and Union among the Mass. 
Delegates. 

We have passed a Resolution that each Colony make such Pro 
vision as it thinks proper and can afford, for defending their Trade

in Harbours Rivers, and on the Sea Coast, against Cutters and 
Tenders. 1 We have had in Contemplation a Resolution to invite 
all Nations to bring their Commodities to Market here, 2 and like 
Fools have lost it for the present. This is a great Idea. What shall 
we do? Shall we invite all Nations to come with their Luxuries, as 
well as Conveniences and Necessaries? or shall We think of con 
fining our Trade with them to our own Bottoms, which alone can 
lay a Foundation for great Wealth and naval Power? Pray think 
of it. 

I rejoice that the Generals and Coll. Reed and Major Mifflin 
are so well received. My most respectfull Compliments to them 
all.

and elegant Letter. Intreat a Continuance of her Favours in this 
Way, to your old Friend

Fame has been trumpeted so loudly, has given a silly Cast to our 
whole Doings. 5 We are between Hawk and Buzzard. We ought

Correspondence of the Revolution. The two Adams letters are given in Works of John Adams, 
n. 41 1 n. with an explanation of the entrusting them to Hichborn. The letters were printed 
in Draper s Massachusetts Gazette, August 17, 1775, and while the text now given differs 
from that used in the Works, it does not differ materially. In a letter from Hannah Win- 
throp to Mercy Warren, September 30, 1775, she wrote: "I have taken pains to procure

Shall I hail you Speaker of the House or Counsellor or what? 
What kind of an Election had you? What sort of Magistrates do 
you intend to make? 

Will your new Legislative and executive feel bold or irresolute? 
Will your Judicial hang and whip and fine and imprison without 
scruples? I want to see our distress d Country once more yet

give us of the State of our Army, the Character of our officers and 
the Scituation of our oppressd Friends in Boston. However ill a 
Choice was made of Delegates for the Continental Congress by

Matters of Fact within their own Colony. But I am disposd to 
make Allowance for the Multiplicity of Affairs you must attend to,

have an only Son, for whom my Anxiety is great. He was edu 
cated at Harvard College and afterwards was Pupil to our worthy 
deceased Friend Dr. Warren. Warren spoke well of this young 
Fellow as being capable in his Business. If he is not already pro

if you will use your Influence for his Promotion as far as he shall 
appear to have merit. I am your Friend,

DEAR SIR, I can never Sufficiently regret that this Congress 
have acted so much out of Character as to leave the Appointment 
of the Quarter Master General, Commissary of Musters and Com 
missary of Artillery to the General; As these officers are Checks 
upon the General, and he a Check upon them, there ought not to 
be too much Connection between them. They ought not to be 
under any dependance upon him or so great obligations of Grati 
tude as those of a Creature to the Creator.

of the Members, added to the necessity and importance of their visiting their several 
Colonies and attending their respective Conventions, have induced them to make a recess

We have another office of vast Importance to fill, I mean that 
of Paymaster General; and if it is not filled with a Gentleman,

America have abundantly merited it, it shall not be my Fault. 
However I can t foretell with Certainty whether I shall be so for

DR. SIR, I shall make you sick at the Sight of a Letter from 
me. 

I find by Edes s Paper that Joseph Pearse Palmer is Quarter 
Master General. I confess I was surprized. 

This office is of high Rank and vast Importance. The Deputy 
Quarter Master General whom we have appointed for the New 
York Department, is a Mr. Donald Campbell, 1 an old regular 
officer, whom We have given the Rank of Collonell. The Quarter 
Master General cannot hold a lower Rank perhaps than a Briga 
dier. 

Mr. Palmer is a young Gentleman of real Merit and good Ac 
complishments; but I should not have thought of a less Man than 
Major General Fry for the Place. It requires an able experienced 
officer. He goes with the Army and views the Ground and marks 
out the Encampment, etc., besides other very momentous Duties. 

I have written to Mr. Palmer, and informed him that the 
Appointment of this Officer is left with the General. 

My dear Friend, it is at this critical Time of great Importance 
to our Province, that We take Care to promote none to Places but 
such as will give them Dignity and Reputation. If We are not very 
solicitous about this We shall injure our Cause with the other 
Colonies. Yours, 

[No signature.] 

I hope before another Year We shall become more familiarly 
acquainted with this great piece of Machinery an Army. 

We have voted three Millions of Dollars. Six Tons of Powder 
are arrived and We have ordered every Pound of it to you.

Six Tons and an half of Powder is brought into the State House

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
WATERTOWN, July 31, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, I had the pleasure of your favours of the 23d. 
instant yesterday. I am glad to find that you have appointed 
Thomas the first brigadier. This I think will satisfy both him and 
the army. I have been obliged to take pains to keep him in the 
camp. He seldom talks imprudently, and I believe has never done 
it on this occasion. Spencer is a man I have no knowledge of. He 
left the camp on the first hearing of the arrangement with resent 
ment. He has since returned, and I am told behaves very well. 
I am convinced of the necessity of supporting your own dignity, 
and the importance of your commissions. If you suffer them to be 
despised they will soon depreciate, and become of little value. 
While Thomas talked of leaving the camp I must do him the jus 
tice to say he exhibited a degree of the virtue you admire. He said 
he would soon return, and serve as a volunteer. I have lately felt 
great uneasiness on your account. Your want of health, and the 
disorder in your eyes yet continuing at a time when you are en 
gaged in such a variety of great and complicated business, I should 
think sufficient, without external embarrassments, and the pain 
you must feel from dissentions which injure the general interest 
of the whole, and that of your Colony in particular. It seems to 
be the misfortune of every man of enlarged ideas and extended 
views, of integrity and disinterested virtue, to be plagued with 
either the narrow, contracted notions, or interested designs of 
those he is connected with in public life. This is exactly your case. 
I have been sensible of it a good while, and have a more perfect 
idea of it than I can express. The hint you give of inviting all 
nations to trade with us is indeed a grand idea, and I can easily 

I Only a fragment of a second leaf of this letter remains. 



96 Warren- Adams Letters [1775 

conceive how bitterly you regret the loss of it. Such a step would 
have been worthy of such a body. It would have been in the true 
stile of a Sully, and have produced mighty consequences. I can 
easily conceive also the narrow principles that operated against 
and finally destroyed them. The two questions you ask, to what 
articles the trade should extend, and what bottoms it should be 
carried on upon, require a nice determination. Perhaps it would 
not answer our immediate purposes so well by being confined to 
our own bottoms, but if it be not, and we should finally be de 
tached from Britain, we might have some difficulty in mak 
ing an alteration so advantageous to ourselves in gaining great 
wealth and naval power. I hope to hear you viva voce on this 
subject. 

After a most profound tranquility for a state of war, several 
skirmishes of some consequence took place last night. The regu 
lars had advanced a little without Charlestown Neck, which gave 
umbrage to our troops. Some firings happened. In the night, 
which was dark, a number of the Riflemen got within their outer 
guards, and but for an unlucky circumstance (they happened at 
that instant to be relieving their guards) had brought off their 
main guard intire. However, a smart action ensued. They 
brought off two or three of them, and several arms, and killed sev 
eral of their men. One of ours was taken by them, supposed to 
have lost his way. About the same time, the regulars, about sixty 
of them, pushed out suddenly on Boston Neck, drove back a few 
of our centinels, and by the negligence of our main guard, and the 
cowardice of the captain l burnt the George Tavern, and retired 
without loss. This is esteemed the greatest disgrace we have suf 
fered. The most capital action was at the light house. You will 
recollect that we burnt it some time ago. They had for some time 
been very industrious in rebuilding it, and had it in such forward 
ness as actually to shew a light on Saturday night. About twenty- 
five whale boats and two hundred men, commanded by Major 
Tupper, set off last night, and arrived about daylight, attacked 

I Captain Christopher Gardner, of Colonel Varnum s regiment. He was tried by court 
martial for deserting his post, and unanimously sentenced to be cashiered, "as incapable 
of serving his country in any military capacity." i Proceedings, xv. 135, 136. 



1775] Warren-Adams Letters 97 

the guard and workmen, and one small tender soon carried it, 
after killing two or three, and wounding four or five more. They 
took all the rest, burnt and destroyed the light house, took thirty 
six prisoners, and all their arms. Among the prisoners are four 
Marshfield Tories, and three or four others. The rest are marines 
and soldiers. One of the Whites of Marshfield is wounded, it is 
said mortally. 1 

August 2. I went yesterday for the first time this session to wait 
on the General. I had rather delayed it, as you had mentioned me 
to him as a person he might consult with, to see if he had any occa 
sion to call on me. However, out of respect to him, and to see if 
I could serve the persons you recommend, I went. I find the Col 
ony, as you predicted, will suffer by referring the appointments you 
mention to him. They will, I think, go to the southward. I am 
amazed that the impropriety of his appointing was not sufficient 
to determine every one of your body, and I should have thought 
both considerations would have clearly determined your breth 
ren. He has not yet made the appointments. When I was coming 
off, I took the freedom to mention the sufferings and abilities of a 
number of gentlemen, and to ask the liberty to mention them, if 
he had any occasion for them even in places of no great impor 
tance. He said there were many gentlemen that had come some 
hundred miles, and as we had so large a share of the places, they 
must be provided for, and that we had among ourselves in effect 
the power of supplying all vacancies in the army, which is true, 
but won t aid our friends. Ever since the action on Sunday eve 
ning there has been a continual firing with cannon or small arms. 
The Riflemen have killed several of them, and among the rest an 
officer, who one of them shot from his horse yesterday at a distance 
of two hundred and fifty yards. The prisoners taken at the light 
house were yesterday carried through this town in their way to 
the gaols in the upper counties. Our Assembly are drudging on in 
the old way, shackled with forms and plagued with the concurrence 
and consent of several branches. A question was started and 
warmly contested whether our Constitution consisted of two or 
three branches, and was determined in favour of the latter, rather

from a supposition that it was your design than from the express 
words of your resolve. It was but last evening I heard of this 
opportunity and have not time to say many things I could wish 
for. I expect the express, and must be ready. The General was 
kind enough to direct he should call. 

You will remember that our army, I mean our forces are inlisted 
only to the last of December. We must perhaps have a winter as 
well as summer campaign. I am well informed that Newfound 
land is supplied with provisions from New York. A late instance. 
A vessel arrived there from [New] York, cleared out for the West 
Indies. This may be worth enquiring into. You mention nothing 
of an adjournment; from others we are made to expect it, and to 
suppose you are on your way home. Your good lady and family 
were well a few days ago. I sent a letter to the care of Major 
Mifflin some days ago for you, perhaps from Mrs. Adams. It was 
sent to me, and so directed. He promised good care of it. Mr. 
Adams son is provided for in the manner he wishes. Pray make 
my regards to him. Nothing but want of time prevents my writing 
to him. Please to give my regards to Mr. Paine. I acknowledge 
the receipt of a letter from him. Shall write him per first oppor

A treaty has subsisted for some time between the Selectmen of 
Boston and Gage, relative to the poor. Application was made to 
us. We provided for them at Salem, and insisted on having the 
donations with them. They are on their way there, but without 
the donations. Last Friday he took a sudden resolution to suffer 
the inhabitants to come out. A number of them landed at Chel 
sea. The General advised us of it. My apprehension of the small 
pox, etc., sent a committee there on Sunday. Many persons have 
come out. All agree in their account of the distresses of the inhab 
itants and soldiery, that they are very sickly, and many of them 
dye. It is said that not less than 1800 of the troops are unfit for 
service. John Brown is out, and was here yesterday. He says 
Gage has determined to detain about thirteen until one Jones l

just received a letter from Mrs. Adams which I enclose. 

GEORGE WASHINGTON TO JAMES WARREN 

SIR, I should be very glad to procure Mr. Hitchbourne s Re 
lease agreeable to your Favour of yesterday if I could think of any 
Mode in which it was practicable. To propose it on any other 
Footing than an Exchange would I fear expose the Application to 
Contempt. As I observe he is included in the Note delivered me 
this Morning by a Committee from the General Court. I appre 
hend it had best be left on that Footing and is most likely to be 
successful. 

It is very surprizing if the Letters intercepted are of Conse 
quence that these Gentlemen should act so imprudent a Part. 
If their suffering only affected themselves I should not think it 
improper that they should feel a little for their Misconduct or 
Negligence. 

I am with much Truth and Regard, Sir, your most Obedt and 
very Hbble Servt,

MY DEAR SIR, I have very accidentally heard of this opportu 
nity by Mr. Brown, and have so short notice of it that I can do little 
more than acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 26th 
July, which I received the day before yesterday. When my mind 
was tortured with anxiety and distress, the arrival of powder in 
this manner is certainly as wonderful an interposition of Provi 
dence in our favour, as used to take place in favour of the Jews

in the days of Moses and Joshua. We have very little news here. 
No remarkable military events have taken place in the army here. 
In short the General has been obliged from principles of frugality 
to restrain his Riflemen. While they were permitted liberty to fire 
on the enemy, a great number of the army would go and fire away 
great quantity of ammunition to no purpose. Four captains and 
a subaltern were killed the beginning of last week chiefly by the 
Riflemen, and I am persuaded they will do great execution. There 
was but one company of them here last week. On Sunday a very 
fine company came in from Virginia. Yesterday morning went 
through this town three companies more; as many are expected 
this morning. I never saw finer fellows. What a view does this 
and the concourse of gentlemen from all the Colonies give us of 
Bernard s and Hutchinson s small faction. Last evening arrived 
here a gentleman from Machias, with an account of their having 
taken two other tenders, so that they now have five prizes, three 
tenders and two sloops taken from Jones. Twenty-eight prison 
ers are on the road, and will be here this day, among whom is 
old Ichabod Jones. 1 The rest are lieutenants of men of war, mid 
shipmen and seamen. Five sloops after wood and fresh provisions 
are taken by Cargill and others, and carried into Penobscot. This 
is doing great service. They are reduced to great straits for wood 
as well as fresh provisions in Boston. It is said it would fetch three 
guineas a cord. They have already burnt all the fences, etc. All 
accounts from Boston agree that they are dismantling the Castle, 
and intend to destroy the works there; which, with other circum 
stances, induce many to suppose they have an intention to leave 
the town. Many people have lately come out. He has restricted 
them to 5 sterling in money, a small matter of furniture, and 
absolutely forbid them bringing out plate. What the policy should 
be, unless he designs to plunder, destroy, and then leave, we can t 
devise. Boylston, John Gill, Lovel, the Selectmen, etc., to the 
number of thirteen, are kept, it is said till Jones and Hicks, two 
insignificant prisoners we have in Concord gaol, are suffered to go 
into Boston. We have resolved they shall go. The General has

sent in the resolve by a trumpet. 1 We have no answer yet, tho 
that was done last Sunday. I am very sorry I should omit any 
information you had occasion for. It is not wholly and only negli 
gence. Such has been the confusion here that it was difficult to 
ascertain who held many of the offices. This was the case with 
young Palmer. I often asked, and never was satisfactorily re 
solved whether he was Quartermaster General or his Deputy. He 
was however the first, and still acts as such in the Massachusetts 
forces, and has expectations of being appointed by the General. 
I can t learn that any of those appointments you so justly regret 
to have referred to other hands than your own are yet made. As 
to Pigeon, I knew he was a commissary, but his temper is so petu 
lant, that he has been desirous of quitting for some time, and, in 
deed, I have wished it. I am taking pains to give you the informa 
tion you want of the biography of the officers in the army, etc. I 
have applied to General Thomas and one other General for that 
purpose. As for engineers, I wish we were in a better way. G[rid- 
le]y is grown old, is much governed by a son of his, who vainly 
supposed he had a right to the second place in the regiment, that 
is before Burbank and Mason. The Congress thought otherways; 
he was sulky. We had much trouble with them, and I understand 
the General has his share yet. . . . 

We have a short adjournment in contemplation, and expect it 
the latter end of this week. You will hear of the accident which 
befel the letters sent by Hitchborne. He very injudiciously kept 
them, when he had all the opportunity he could wish to destroy 
them. I wish to hear whether the letter to me was from you or 
Mr. S. Adams. I lost the pleasure of it, and they boast of great 
discoveries made from that and the two letters to General Wash 
ington. . . .

HANNAH WINTHROP TO MERCY WARREN 

ANDOVER, Aug. 17, 1775. 

DEAR MRS. WARREN, THE FRIEND AND SISTER OF MY HEART^ - 
What a great Consolation is it that tho the restless ambition and 
unbounded Avarice and wicked machinations of some Original 
Characters have deprivd us of many of the pleasures of life yet are 
they not able to take from us the heartfelt Satisfaction of mutual 
affection and Friendly Converse. Your Favor Truly Delineates 
human nature in a disagreeable light. The Contrast is very strik 
ing! What have we to expect from such Vitiated Persons as you 
present to view in the British Generals. I hope their Wicked 
inclinations will be restraind. I am Charmed with the Portrait 
you give of General Washington. Must not we expect Success 
under the direction of so much goodness. But my heart Bleeds for 
the people of Boston, my Blood boils with resentment at the Treat 
ment they have met with from Gage. Can anything equal his 
Barbarity. Turning the poor out of Town without any Support, 
those persons who were possessd of any means of Support stopd 
and Searchd, not sufferd to carry anything with them. Can any 
thing equal the distress of parents Seperated from their Children, 
the tender husband detaind in Cruel Captivity from the Wife of 
his Bosom, she torn with anxiety in fearfull looking for and expec 
tation of Vengeance from the obdurate heart of a Tyrant sup 
ported by wicked advisers. Can a Merciful Heaven look on these 
things and not interpose. Is there not a day of retribution at 
hand! Should these things continue what a horrid Prospect 
would a Severe Winter afford and how many must fall a Sacrifice 
to the unrelenting rigors of Cold and Want. Be ye clothd and be 
ye warmd will be of little Efficacy to the trembling nakd limbs 
or the hungry Soul of many a one who once livd in Affluence. I 
believe human Nature never produced but one Parallel Tyrant, 
Cesar Borgia, the Series of whose Cruelties will at any time make 
human Nature Shudder. You kindly enquire after my Sister. I have 
seen her but once since the Charlestown Conflagration. She is poorly 
accomodated at Stoneham. I found her and my Brother Mason 1

too much affected with their Loss. I really think their pros 
pects peculiarly discouraging. He has been out of business for 
a Twelvemonth past, a Large Family to provide for. He ad 
vanced in life and losing his habitation by the hands of as barbar 
ous an enemy as ever appeard on the theatre of life to torment 
mankind. Where is the Historic page that can furnish us with 
such Villainy. The Laying a whole town in ashes after repeated 
promises that if they would protect their troops in their return 
from Concord, it should have been the last place that should suffer 
harm. How did they give shelter to the wounded expiring soldiers ; 
their houses their beds were prepared to receive them, the women 
readily engaged in pouring balm in to their wounds, making broths 
and Cordials to support their exhausted spirits, for at that time 
the Softer Sex had not been innured to trickling blood and gaping 
wounds. Some of the unhappy Victims died. They gave up the 
ghost Blessing the hands that gave relief, and now in return for their 
kindness they take the first opportunity to make 500 householders 
miserable involving many a poor widow and orphan in one com 
mon ruin. Be astonished o heavens at this and let the inhabitants 
/of America tremble to fall into the hands of such a merciless 
foe. 

But a more pleasing theme presents to me and I most Sincerely 
rejoice in the Late Appointment of your dear Consort to an Hon 
orable and I hope profitable employment. The Assiduity and 
Fortitude with which he has Labord in the Fair field of Patriotic 
Virtue thro much self denial and Toil I think merits very highly 
of his Country and it must give pleasure to every Friend of Liberty 
to see such Abilities and unabating Services meet with some recom- 
pence before the Warfare is finished. May He long live a Blessing 
to his Country and reap the fruits of his Labors in a quiet and 
peaceable resting place. I now write from the Solitude of Andover 
and tho reducd to humble life yet by no means is my firm per 
suasion staggered in the glorious Cause we are Struggling in, the 
Cause of Virtue truth and justice. Your Faith that the united 
Efforts will be Blest with Success animates me. I catch a spark 
of that heavenly Flame which invigorates your breast knowing 
your Faith has a permanent Foundation and your acquaintance

JOHN ADAMS TO MERCY WARREN 

BRAINTREE, Aug. [26], 1775 

MADAM, I have been the happiest Man these two Days past, 
that I know of in the World. I have compared myself in my own 
Mind, with all my Friends and I cannot believe any of them so 
blest as myself. 

In the first Place, Rest, you know, is Rapture to a weary Man 
and I was quite weary enough to enjoy a State of Rest for a Day 
or two in all its Perfection, accordingly I have Slept by the best 
Computation, Sixteen Hours in the four and twenty. 

In the next Place for the two last Days I have been entirely free 
from the Persecution of the "Fidgets and Caprices, Vanity, Super 
stition, and Irritability," which are Supposed by Some to assault 
me, now and then both from within and without. This is rare 
Felicity indeed. 

Thirdly I have been allowed the Pleasure of rambling all alone, 
through the Fields, Groves and Meadows, and over the lofty 
Mountains, of peaceful happy Braintree, that wholesome Solitude 
and Nurse of Sense, 

Where Contemplation prunes her Ruffled Wings 
And the free Soul looks down to pity kings. 

Fourthly and lastly, I have enjoyed the Conversation of the 
amiable Portia and her little prattling Brood of Children. This is 
a Pleasure of which I can Say no more. Mrs. Warren can conceive 
it; I cannot describe it. 

Now taking all these Circumstances together neither Mr. Warren 
nor Mr. [erased], nor Mr. any Body that I can recollect, has been 
in a Situation equal to mine. 



1775] Warren- Adams Letters 105 

These have been vexed with the Society of Statesmen and 
Heroes; I have been disturbed with no such Animal. These have 
been interrupted with Cares; I have banished all of them from my 
Habitation from my Head and Heart. These have been wearied 
with Business; I would have no Business but have been wholly 
at Leisure. In short, I have some Idea now of the Happiness of 
the Inhabitants of Arcadia, Paradise, and the Elisian Fields. 

Why will the cruel Thought intrude itself? Is this to last only 
untill Monday Morning four o clock? 1 Avaunt this gloomy 
Thought, this impertinent Intruder; I wont Suffer myself to think 
that it is ever to End untill the Moment arrives and then I must 
endeavour to forget for a while, that I have ever been so happy. 

I hope, Madam, I shall not be left to Stain this Paper with any 
Thing concerning Politicks or War. I was determined to write 
you before I went away and there is no other Subject in the whole 
Compass of Art, Science, or Nature, upon which I could have 
written one Line without diminishing my Happiness. 

I wish you, Madam, a Speedy Return, with your worthy Part 
ner, to your Family, and a Happiness there as exquisite as mine 
has been here and much more lasting. Lam with unfeigned Es 
teem and Affection your and Mr. Warren s Friend and humble 
Servant,

MY DEAR MRS. WARREN, It was with pleasure I received 
a line from my Friend to-day informing me of her better Health. 
I was really anxious for her, more so on account of the Great mor 
tality which prevails around us. I arrived at my own habitation 
a fryday and found my family all well a blessing which I hope 
will be continued to me. 

The peaceful tranquility of my own habitation was enhanced 
to me by a few days absence, amidst a more Noisy and tumultuous

Society of my Friends. 

I have not heard any of the allarms you mention, only the ar 
tillery of the clouds which has been pretty heavey this afternoon 
but produced us many refreshing Showers in which I rejoice for 
many reasons. My Friend will leave me tomorrow morning and 
will have a much more agreeable journey for the rain. I find I am 
obliged to summon all my patriotism to feel willing to part with 
him again, you will readily believe me when I say that I make no 
small sacrifice to the publick. 

You write me that you have been to Head Quarters, and there 
seen the Letters. 1 Pray what did you think of them? Money must 
be much plentier than provisions with Gage or he would not think 
of setting so high a value upon them. 

I shall send this by Mr. Adams who will call upon you as he has 
alterd his mind with regard to going to Deadam. I shall be very 
glad to see my Friend Next week, any week or any time she may 
be assured of a hearty welcome from her affectionate,

The ships which arrived last Fryday are from Halifax, with a 
few potatoes and a little wood. The people there are in expecta 
tion of an attack from a body of troops, which they hear are 
to be sent down under the command of Preble, 2 and are preparing 
for defence. If they suffer such terrors from the name of a worn- 
out American veteran what must be their apprehensions from 
the active, vigorous, spirited heroes who are rising up from every 
corner of the United Colonies to oppose the wicked system of 
politicks which has long governed a corrupt court. 

But I ask pardon for touching on war, politicks, or any thing

relative thereto, as I think you gave me a hint in yours not to 
approach the verge of any thing so far beyond the line of my sex. 

The worthy bearer 1 of this will inform you of all the intelligence 
stirring. Tranquility still reigns in the camp. We scarcely hear the

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
WATERTOWN, September n, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, I please myself with the probability that 
before this you are safely arrived at Philadelphia, after having fine 
weather for journeying. I hope you will not be disappointed in your 
wishes with regard to the spirit and temper of the Congress. I 
should have wrote you before, if I had been well; but from a cold 
I took in the long storm we had here, have been much indisposed 
since you left us. Am now much better. Nothing very material 
has occurred. The military operations are much in the same way 
as when you was last here. The works on Ploughed Hill are thought 
to be impregnable. They fired at them and Roxbury till they 
tired themselves, and have now in a manner ceased. We seldom 
hear a cannon, tho these natural effusions of resentment and dis 
appointment now and then give us an instance, harmless enough, 
for they never injure us. All seems to be in a tranquil state for a 
war. The greatest difficulty seems to be to govern our own sol 
diery; I may say the Riflemen only, for I hear of no other. Yester 
day the General was obliged to order no less than twenty-four of 
them under guard. 3 They are the most disorderly part of the army, 
if not alone so. I have not been at head quarters since Saturday, 
but am told that for some crime one of them was ordered under 

I Stephen Collins. 2 Samuel Swift, the lawyer?

mutiny. Thirty-two were sentenced to pay twenty shillings each, and one was sentenced 
to six days imprisonment in addition to the fine. I Proceedings^ xv. 154.

guard. An attempt was made by a number to rescue him. Upon 
which they were also ordered to be put under guard; upon which 
a whole company undertook to rescue them, and the General was 
obliged to call out a large detachment from the Rhode Island 
Troops to apprehend them, who though prepared for resistance, 
thought proper to submit, and the ringleaders are now in custody. 
I believe he will choose to make examples of them. I should, were 
I in his place. We have in a few days past a great deal of foreign 
news, and all seems to agree that both England and Ireland are 
in great confusion. It is said the Irish Parliament have resolved 
that no more troops, or provisions for troops, shall come from there 
to America, and that several of the recruiting parties there have 
been killed; that the whole kingdom is in an uproar, and in such 
an opposition to administration as will intitle them equally with 
the Americans to the character of rebels. The vessel that brings 
this account has been stopped by the men of war at Rnode Island 
in her way to Providence, and perhaps many other particulars 
smothered. Callihorne 1 is arrived at Boston, and several letters 
have been received, and some of them sent out of Boston, giving 
assurances that no more troops will be sent to America, and that 
the dispute will be soon settled. Oliver Wendel 2 told me he had 
seen one to that purpose from a man whose intelligence he could 
depend on. Other letters I hear of, which say the people had obliged 
the King to promise not only to send no other troops out but to 
recall the fleet and army already here. If all this be true how sea 
sonably will your last petition arrive to serve as a mantle to cover 
the nakedness of the Ministry, and to screen them from the shame 
of being forced to a retreat by the virtue of the Americans. Depend 
on it, they will catch at it, like a hungry fish at a bait, and we must 
be content with a harvest blasted with mildew, and cut before it 
is ripe, and consequently of little value. Does no powder arrive? 
I wish we may be able to give them at least one blast more that 
they may leave us thoroughly impressed with a sense of American 
bravery and prowess, if they do go. I know you won t fail to do 
every thing in your power to furnish us. Money, if possible, grows 
scarcer than powder. The last dollar, perhaps, will be gone to-

morrow, and then I expect we shall all be din d with clamours and 
complaints. We have enough of them already from the largeness 
of the bills. 1200 men march this afternoon and to-morrow under 
Colonel Arnold for Newbury Port, to embark for Kennebeck on 
their way to Quebec. I wish they may not be intercepted in their 
passage. Were I to conduct the matter I think I should march 
them all the way by land. Two frigates and a number of schooners, 
I am told, left Boston yesterday, probably to intercept them. A 
few deserters came over to us, and several of our riflemen have 
deserted to the enemy. A ship from Piscataqua for the West 
Indies, owned by Mr. Langdon, was taken by the Lively, and has 
been retaken by an armed vessel from Beverly, and carried into 
Cape Anne. The prisoners were bro t to Head quarters on Satur 
day. I don t find your friend P. Henry in the list of delegates from 
Virginia. How does it happen? It gives me concern; you know I 
have a great opinion of him. 

Our Council are yet sitting, tho they talk of an adjournment 
tomorrow. They seem to have been very busy. I can hardly tell 
you what has been done since you left us. Colonel Prescott, sheriff 
of this county, Colonel Dwight, Worcester, Dr. Winthrop, Judge 
of Probate, his son Reg r Foster appointed for Worcester. No

DR SIR, I have nothing in particular to write. Our most 
gracious K has given a fresh Proof of his Clemency in his An 
swer to the City. But no more of Politicks at present. If this 
Scratch of a Pen should fall into the Hands of the wiseacre Gage, 
as long as I confine myself to Matrimony and Horsemanship, there 
will be no Danger. 



1 1 o Warren- Adams Letters [1775 

Be it known to you then that two of the most unlikely Things, 
within the whole Compass of Possibility, have really and actually 
happened. The first is the suden Marriage of our President, whose 
agreeable Lady honours us with her Presence and contributes 
much to our good Humour as well as to the Happiness of the 
President. So much for that. 1 

The next Thing is more wonderfull still. 

You know the Aversion which your Secretary, 2 has ever enter 
tained to riding, on Horseback he never would be persuaded to 
mount a Horse. The last time we were here I often laboured to 
persuade him, for the Sake of his Health but in vain. Soon after 
we set out on the last Journey, I reflected that some Degree of 
Skill and Dexterity in Horsemanship, was necessary to the Char 
acter of a Statesman. It would take more Time and Paper than I 
have to Spare to shew the Utility of Horsemanship to a Politician; 
so I shall take this for granted. But I pointed out the particulars 
to him, and likewise shewed him that Sociability would be greatly 
promoted by his mounting one of my Horses. 

On Saturday the second day of September, 1775, in the Town 
of Grafton He was prevailed on to put my Servant with his, into 
Harrison s Chaise and to mount upon my Horse, a very genteel 
and easy little Creature. We were all disappointed and Surprised. 
Instead of the Taylor riding to Brentford We beheld, an easy, gen 
teel Figure upon the Horse, and a good deal of Spirit and Facility, 
in the Management of the Horse, insomuch that We soon found our 
Servants were making some disagreeable Comparisons, and since 
our arrival here I am told that Fessenden (impudent Scoundrel) 
reports that the Secretary rides fifty per cent better than your 
Correspondent. 

In this manner, We rode to Woodstock, where we put up for the 
Sabbath. It was soon observed that the Secretary could not sit 
so erect in his Chair as he had Sat upon his Horse, but Seemed to 
be neither sensible of the Disease or the Remedy. I soon perceived 
and apprised him of both. On Sunday Evening, at Mr. Dexter s,

where we drank Coffee and spent an agreeable evening I persuaded 
him to purchase two yards of flannell, which we carried to our 
Landlady, who, with the assistance of a Taylor Woman in the 
House, made up a Pair of Drawers, which the next morning were 
put on, and not only defended the Secretary from any further 
Injury, but entirely healed the little Breach which had been 
begun. 

Still an Imperfection remained. Our Secretary had not yet 
learned to mount and dismount. Two Servants were necessary to 
attend upon these occasions, one to hold the Bridle and Stirrup, the 
other to boost the Secretary. This was rather a ridiculous Circum 
stance still. At last, I undertook to instruct him the necessary Art 
of mounting. I had my Education to this Art, under Bates, the 
celebrated Equerry, and therefore might be Supposed to be a 
Master of it. I taught him, to grasp the Bridle with his Right 
Hand over the Pummell of his Saddle, to place his left Foot firm 
in the Stirrup; to twist his left Hand into the Horses Main, about 
half Way between his Ears and his Shoulders, and then a vigorous 
Exertion of his Strength would carry him very gracefully into the 
Seat, without the least Danger of falling over on the other Side. 
The Experiment was tryed and Succeeded to Admiration. Thus 
equipped and instructed, our Horseman rode all the Way from 
Woodstock to Philadelphia, Sometimes upon one of my Horses, 
Sometimes on the other, and acquired fresh Strength, Courage, 
Activity and Spirit every day. His Health is much improved by it, 
and I value myself, very much upon the Merit of having probably 
added Several years to a Life so important to his Country, by 
the little Pains I took to persuade him to mount and teach him to 
ride. 

Sully and Cecil were both Horsemen and you know I would not 
have our Americans, inferior to them in the Smallest Accomplish 
ment. 

Pray Mrs. Warren to write to me. I would to her, if I had half 
so much Time. 1

DEAR SIR, I have but a Moment s Time to write and nothing 
of Importance to say. 

Mr. Randolph our former President is here and Sits very hum 
bly in his Seat, while our new one continues in the Chair, without 
Seeming to feel the Impropriety. 1 Coll. Nelson, 2 a Planter, Mr. 
Wythe, 3 a Lawyer and Mr. Francis Lightfoot Lee, 4 a Planter, are 
here from Virginia, instead of Henry, Pendleton 5 and Bland. 6 
Henry is General of Virginia the other two are old and infirm. 
I am well pleased that Virginia has Set the Example of changing 
Members and I hope that Massachusetts will follow it, and all the 
other Colonies. I should be glad upon a new Election to be re 
lieved from this Service, this Climate does not agree with my Con 
stitution So well as our own, and I am not very well fortified you 
know against the Inclemencies of any. 

This Congress, I assure you, feels the Spirit of War, more in 
timately than they did before the Adjournment. They Set about 
/ Preparations for it with Seriousness and in Earnest.

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
WATERTOWN, September 19, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, I had fixed a determination in my own 
mind, to omit no opportunity of writing either to you, or my friend 
Mr. S. Adams; but I have indeed so little to say at this time, that 
I should have thought it hardly worth while to trouble you with a 
letter had it not been to inclose one from Mrs. Adams who, with 
the children, I had the pleasure yesterday to hear were recovered. 
I have been much concerned about them. I presume the inclosed 

1 May 24, Peyton Randolph, President, was under a necessity of returning to Virginia, 
to take his place as Speaker of the House of Burgesses, and the Journals of the Congress 
state "the chair was vacant." John Hancock was then unanimously chosen President. 
Randolph never occupied the chair again, and died October 22, 1775.

will give you the state of the family, and make it unnecessary for 
me to add more. I have been here ever since you left us, without 
once hearing from you. I wrote to you a week ago, and took pains 
to collect every thing I could think of as new, foreign and domestic. 
Your intelligence from abroad is so much better than ours at this 
time that I expect no success in handing you our foreign news; and 
of the domestic kind we have very little. We suffer extremely for 
want of it. When we meet in the street we have not a word more 
to say than to inquire after each other s health, or make an ob 
servation on the weather. These are circumstances so different 
from what we have been used to, that we are quite out of our ele 
ment. Scarcely any one thing has happened since my last worthy 
of your notice. We have frequent desertions to us, seldom two 
nights without an instance of that kind; the night before last were 
four or five sailors. By the best accounts given by gentlemen out 
of town, the soldiery are dispirited by their confinement, their 
want of supplies, and above all by their vast fatigue. They live in 
continual horror of being attacked. Their guards are therefore 
large, and must be numerous from the extensiveness of their works. 
It is supposed that frequent shews of attacking them, would soon 
wear them out. I mentioned this at Head-quarters yesterday. 
I hope they will take that method to harrass them. A servant of 
General Howe deserted about ten days ago. I heard him tell the 
General that his master constantly set up till one o clock, and then 
slept till morning in his boots and cloaths. They seem to be mak 
ing but little preparation for winter. It was reported that they 
were pulling down the houses from the Haymarket to the forti 
fication, in order to erect works to retreat to if they could not 
hold those they now have. They really have begun to pull down 
the houses; but it is generally thought to be only for fuel, of which 
they are in great want, and they choose that place as the clearing 
would be most convenient for new works, if they should have oc 
casion for more. We have had scarce a gun fired for ten days be 
fore Sunday morning, when a number of the Rebels 1 appearing 
without their works on Boston Neck, our people fired four cannon 
on them, which drove them in, killed two and wounded five of 

1 It is under this term that Warren described the British.

their men, as we have learned by deserters. They returned a 
smart fire without any success. And yesterday again Roxbury 
side had a very heavy cannonade with as little, only one officer 
very slightly wounded. This is indeed very remarkable, as our 
people expose themselves without reserve, having been so enured 
to shot and shells that do no execution, that they totally disregard 
them. Cobble Hill is to be possessed and fortified this or tomorrow 
night. Putnam is to be gratified with the command. This must 
open a warm scene, and will furnish us abundantly with the musick 
of cannon, and topicks of conversation. The constant expectation 
I have had of receiving the money from Philadelphia has confined 
me to this place, contrary to both my inclinations and interest, 
supposing it would not do to be absent when it came. It is not yet 
arrived. This delay is astonishing, and I fear will cause irreparable 
injuries to the army. The soldiers that are not paid for the month 
of August are very uneasy. The General can t fulfill his promise to 
them. The Quarter master General and Commissary General are 
both out of money, their credit suffering, and their provisions for 
the army at a stand, and this at a time when the season is approach 
ing that transportation from distant places will be difficult. Do 
apologize to my friend Adams for my not writing to him. It is 
really owing to the poverty of the times. I had no subject without 
I had entered on metaphysics, mathematics, or some subjects 
foreign from politics or news, which alone engage my attention. 
I will, however, write him soon, subject or no subject. The Coun 
cil adjourned for a week. The Assembly meets tomorrow. When 
ever any thing occurs, you shall hear it, and [I] shall on my part 
be glad to hear of your doings. I want to hear of high spirited 
measures. It is in my opinion ridiculous to hesitate now about 
taking up crown officers, and fifty other things. You won t lose 
sight of powder and money. . . . 

I forgot to tell you that they are exercising their wit, and divert 
ing themselves in Boston by versifying the letters taken from 
Hitchburne, as I hear. I have not been able to get sight of it.

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, Septr. 26, 1775 

DR SIR, This afternoon and not before I received a Line 
from the excellent Marcia, which [is] the first and only Letter I 
have received from the Family to which She belongs Since I left 
Watertown. Be pleased to thank her for this Favour and to let 
her know that She must certainly have misinterpreted Some Pas 
sage in my Letter, Since I never thought either Politicks or War, 
or any other Art or Science beyond the Line of her Sex: on the con 
trary I have ever been convinced that Politicks and War, have in 
every Age been influenced, and in many, guided and controuled 
by her Sex. Sometimes it is to be feared by the unworthy Part of 
it; but at others, it must be confessed by the amiable and the good. 
But if I were of opinion that it was best for a general Rule that the 
fair should be excused from the arduous Cares of War and State; 
I should certainly think that Marcia and Portia, ought to be Ex 
ceptions, because I have ever ascribed to those Ladies, a Share and 
no Small one neither, in the Conduct of our American Affairs. 

I have nothing new to communicate. Every Thing, has been 
done, and is now doing, to procure the Unum Necessarium. 1 I 
wish I could give you a more agreable account of the Salt Petre 
Works in this City. I fear they have chosen injudiciously a Place 
for their Vatts Vaults and Buildings, a low marshy Place which 
was lately overflowed by the Storm. Still We have Sanguine 
Accounts of the Skill and Success of Some operators. 

Coll. Dyer produces a Sample of excellent Salt Petre made by 
two De Witts, one of Norwich the other of Windham, and he is 
confident that they can and will make large Quantities. Coll. 
Harrison of Virginia, whose taste in Madeira I know, and in girls 
I believe, 2 and in Salt Petre I hope, to be much Superiour to his 
Judgment in Men, is very confident that they are making large 
Quantities from Tobacco House Earth in his Colony. 

We are hourly expecting Intelligence from Canada, as well as 
Massachusetts, and from London.

n6 Warren- Adams Letters [1775 

My dear Sir, Let me intreat you to do every Thing in your 
Power to get ready the Accounts of all that our Province has done 
and expended in the Common Cause, for which they expect or 
hope to be reimbursed by the United Colonies. It has ever ap 
peared to me a Thing of much Importance, that We should be fur 
nished with those accounts as soon as possible. From present ap 
pearances, our Session will not be long and if We should not be 
furnished with the Necessary Papers very soon, We shall not be 
able to obtain any Reimbursement this Fall; and the next Spring 
We may be involved in So many Dangers as well as new Expences 
as to render our Chance for obtaining Justice, more precarious. 
You know that your Delegates have been here almost the whole 
Time since the Commencement of Hostilities, and therefore can 
say nothing of their own Knowledge concerning your Exertions 
or Expences but must depend altogether upon Information from 
the General Court. 

This is really a Strong Reason for a Change in the Delegation. 

We have been absent so long from our native Country as to be a 
kind of Aliens and Strangers there. If it is good Policy to re-elect 
one of the old Delegates, because he is personally knowing to what 
has passed here; it is equally good Policy to elect Some new ones, 
because they are Witnesses of what has passed with you. For my 
own Part, as my political Existence terminates with the Year, I 
sincerely wish to be exempt in the next Election. I long to be a 
little with you in the General Court, that I may see and hear, and 
feel with my Countrymen, and I ardently wish to be a little with 
my Family and to attend a little to my private affairs. To be 
frank and candid to a Friend, I begin to feel for my Family. To 
leave all the Burthen of my private Cares, at a Time when my 
affairs are in so much Perplexity, to an excellent Partner, gives 
me Pain for her. To leave the Education of a young Family en 
tirely to her, altho I know not where it could be better lodged, 
gives me much Concern for her and them. 

I have very little Property, you very well know, which I have 
not earned myself by an obstinate Industry, in opposition to the 
Malice of a very infirm Constitution, in Conjunction with the 
more pernicious Malice of Ministerial and gubernatorial Enemies. 



1775] Warren- Adams Letters 117 

Of the little Acquisitions I have made, five hundred Pounds Ster 
ling is sunk in Boston in a Real Estate, four hundred Sterling 
more is completely annihilated in a Library that is now wholly 
useless to me and mine, 1 and at least four hundred Sterling more is 
wholly lost to me in Notes and Bonds, not one farthing of the 
Principal or Interest of which can I obtain, and the Signers are 
dying, breaking, flying every day. 

It is now compleatly two years since my Business has been to 
tally ruined by the public Confusions. I might modestly estimate 
the Profits of my Business before this Period at three hundred ster 
ling a Year, perhaps more. I think therefore I may fairly estimate 
myself a sufferer immediately to the Amount of two Thousand 
Pounds sterling. I have purchased Lands, which these Causes 
have prevented me from paying for, and the Interest is running on 
without a Possibility of my paying it and I am obliged to hire 
Labour yearly upon my Farm to no small amount. 

In the mean Time all that has been granted me by the general 
Court for the sessions of this Congress last Fall and this Spring 
has not defrayed my necessary Expences however strange it may 
appear. 

The Conclusion from all this is, that I am rushing rapidly into 
Perplexities and Distresses in my private affairs from which I can 
never extricate myself. By retreating from Public Life, in some 
Measure I might preserve myself and Family from a Ruin, which 
without it will be inevitable. I am willing to Sink with my Coun 
try, but it ought not to be insisted on that I should sink myself 
without any Prospect of contributing by that Means to make it 
Swim. I have taken my Trick at Helm when it was not easy to get 
Navigators who would run the Risque of the Storm. At present 
the Course is plain whatever the Weather may be, and the pros 
pect of that is much better than it was when I was called to assist 
in steering the Ship.

PHILADELPHIA, Septr. 26, 1775 

MADAM, Your Favour by my Friend Collins never reached 
me till this Evening. At Newport, concluding to go by Water, he 
put it into the Post Office least it Should meet with a Fate as unfor 
tunate as Some others. I call them unfortunate after the manner of 
Men. For, altho they went into Hands which were never thought 
of by the Writer, and notwithstanding all the unmeaning Noise 
that has been made about them, they have done a great deal of 
good. Providence intended them for Instruments to promote 
valuable Purposes, altho the Writer of them, thought so little of 
them that he never could have recollected one Word in them, if 
they had been lost. The most that I care about them, is the inde 
cent Exposure of the Name of a Lady, 1 who cannot be put to 
Pain, without giving me Uneasiness by Sympathy. 

I boasted, Madam, of my Happiness, in my last to you, because 
I knew you could excuse the Appearance of Vanity and because I 
knew very well that the Person who so deservedly holds the first 
Place in your Heart, could Say by Experience, that an Happi 
ness so perfect was not merely ideal. . . .

Let me intreat the earliest Attention of our Houses to the Ac-"\ 
counts and Vouchers of our Province. Accounts must be exact 
and Vouchers genuine, or we shall suffer. The whole Attention of 
every Member of both Houses would be not unprofitably em 
ployed upon this Subject untill it is finished.

DR SIR, Mr. Lynch, Coll. Harrison and Dr. Franklyn are pre 
paring for a Journey to Watertown and Cambridge, 1 one of whom 
will do me the Favour of taking this Letter. 

Mr. Lynch, 2 you have seen before he is an oppulent Planter 
of Great Understanding and Integrity and the best Affections to 
our Country and Cause. 

Coll. Harrison 3 is of Virginia, and the Friend and Correspondent 
of the General, but it seems by a certain Letter under some degree 
of Prejudice against our dear New Englandmen. These Prejudices 
however, have arisen from Misrepresentation and may be easily 
removed. 

Dr. Franklin needs nothing to be said. There is no abler or bet- I 
ter American, that I know of. J 

I could wish a particular Attention and Respect to all Three. 

I know you will be pleased to be introduced to these Gentlemen,

1 On the 29th, after spending most of the morning in debate on the motion, Congress 
appointed a committee of three "to repair immediately to the camp at Cambridge," to 
confer with General Washington, executives of the New England governments, and others, 
"touching the most effectual method of continuing, supporting, and regulating a conti 
nental army." On the next day a ballot was taken for members of the committee. Lynch 
and Franklin were chosen, and Harrison and Dyer had a tie vote. On a subsequent ballot 
Harrison received a majority. Journals of the Continental Congress, in. 265, 266. Congress

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. i, 1775 

DEAR SIR, This morning I received your kind Favours of the 
1 1 th and I9th Ult. with the Inclosures. Draper s Paper is a great 
Curiosity and you will oblig me by sending it as often as possible. 

The foreign News you mention, is all a Delusion my Friend.. 
You may depend upon it, every Measure is preparing by the Min 
istry to destroy Us if they can, and that a Scottish Nation is Sup 
porting them. 

Heaven helps those who help themselves, and I am happy to 
find a Disposition so rapidly growing in America to exert itself. 

The Letters, by your Packett from my Family, have given me 
Serious Concern indeed. I am much at a Loss what Course to take. 
I have thoughts of returning home. I fear, my dear Mrs. Adams s 
Health will sink under the Burthen of Care that is upon her. I 
might well enough be spared from this Place, where my Presence 
is of no Consequence, and my Family might derive some advan 
tage from my being there, and I might have an Opportunity of 
attending a Conference between a Comtee of this Congress and the 
Council of Mass., where perhaps I might be of more service than 
I can [be] here. However I am not determined. My- Friend, your 
Secretary 1 is very much averse to my going. I don t know what 
to do. 

The Comtee who are going to the Camp, are Dr. Franklin, Mr. 
Lynch and Coll. Harrison, who I hope will be received with Friend 
ship and Politeness, by all our Friends. 

I assure you, Sir, there is a serious Spirit here. Such a Spirit as 
I have not known before. 

The Committee, by whom this Letter will go, are determined 
Americans. I fear that two of them, I mean Mr. L and H. may 
have received some unfavourable Impressions from Misrepresen 
tations, concerning our Province; but these will be easily removed, 
by what they will see and hear, I hope. I wish that every Civility 
may be shewn them, which their Fortunes, Characters and Sta 
tions demand.

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
WATERTOWN, October i, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, An event has lately taken place here which 
makes much noise, and gives me much uneasiness, not only as it 
affects the character, and may prove the ruin of a man who[m] I 
used to have a tolerable opinion of, but as it may be the cause of 
many suspicions and jealousies, and what is still worse, have a 
tendency to discredit the recommendations of my friends at the 
Congress. Dr. Church has been detected in a correspondence with 
the Enemy, at least so far that a letter wrote by him in curious 
cypher and directed to Major Cane l (who is an officer in the Rebel 
army and one of Gage s family), has been intercepted. The his 
tory of the whole matter is this. The Doctor, having formed an 
infamous connection with an infamous hussey to the disgrace of 
his own reputation, and probable ruin of his family, wrote this 
letter last July, and sent it by her to Newport with orders to give 
it to Wallace, 2 or Dudley, 3 to deliver to Wallace for conveyance 
to Boston. She, not finding an opportunity very readily, trusted it 
with a friend of hers to perform the orders, and came away and left 
it in his hands. He kept it some time, and having some suspicions 
of wickedness, had some qualms of conscience about executing his 
commissions, after some time consulted his friend. One result was 
to open the letter, which was done. The appearance of the letter 
increasing their suspicions, the next question after determining 
not to send it to Boston was, what should be done with it. After 
various conferences at divers times, they concluded to deliver it 
to General Washington. Accordingly the man came with it last 
Thursday. 4 After collecting many circumstances, the man was 

1 Maurice Cane, lieutenant colonel in the Sixth Regiment. 

2 James Wallace, commanding the ship Rose, stationed at Newport. 

3 Charles Dudley, collector of the customs. 

4 This person was named Godfrey Wainwood, an inhabitant of Newport. See Writings 
of Washington (Ford), in. 163.

employed to draw from the girl, by using the confidence she had 
in him, the whole secret, but without success. She is a subtle, 
shrewd jade. She was then taken into custody and brought to the 
General s quarters that night. It was not till the next day that 
anything could be got from her. She then confessed that the 
Doctor wrote and sent her with the letter as above. Upon this, 
the General sent a note desiring Major Hawley 1 and me to come 
immediately to Cambridge. We all thought the suspicion quite 
sufficient to justify an arrest of him and his papers, 2 which was 
done, and he is now under a guard. He owns the writing and send 
ing the letter, says it was for Flemming 3 in answer to one he wrote 
to him, 4 and is calculated by magnifying the numbers of the army, 
their regularity, their provisions and ammunition, etc., to do great 
service to us. He declares his conduct tho indiscreet was not 
wicked. There are, however, many circumstances, new and old, 
which time won t permit me to mention, that are much against 
him. The letter, I suppose, is now decyphering, and when done will 
either condemn, or in some measure excuse him. 5 Thus much for 
this long story. 

A strong S.W. wind put into Marblehead last week a New Prov 
idence man, 6 with a large number of turtle, etc., etc. They 
boarded, took and carryed him to Salem, and prevented the scoun 
drels from enjoying and feasting on callipee, callipack, 7 and a 
desert of pine apples, etc. A few fisher men also have taken a 
brigantine from Quebec with cattle, sheep, oatmeal, etc., a present

2 A confidant had been through Church s papers before Washington s agent reached 
them. 

3 "Brother" of Church. A letter to Colden in February, 1776, says "Fleming the 
printer." This was John Fleming, partner of John Mein, printers and booksellers in 
Boston. 

4 This letter of Fleming is in Journal of the House of Representatives (Mass.), October 
27, 1775- 

5 In a short note of October 2nd Warren says: "I have just heard that the letter is de- 
cyphered, and is much against the writer." Adams MSS. It was decyphered by West. The 
text appeared in the New England Chronicle, January 4, 1776. A council of war was held 
on October 3-4, a record of which is in the Washington Papers, Library of Congress. It 
is printed in Journals of the House of Representatives (Mass.), October 27, 1775.

from the Tory merchants, etc., to the sick and wounded in Bos 
ton, and some forage for the Light horse. She is carried in to Cape 
Ann. There are two letters from one Gamble, 1 an officer, one to 
General Gage, the other to SherrifF, 2 which tell them that they are 
to expect no aid to Government from there; that Carleton dare 
not issue his orders to the militia, supposing they could not be 
obeyed; that the Canadians, poisoned from New England, had 
got in use the damned abused word Liberty. I can t recollect the 
time she sailed, her bills [of] lading dated September 5, but the 
master says that Carlton has had no success in recruiting. He 
went off the night he came away, for St. Johns, with about seventy 
five raggamuffins, the whole posse he could collect; that there were 
at Quebec 10,000 barrels powder. I long for them more than turtle 
or pine apples. Arnold was last Monday with his detachment, 
sixty miles up Kennebeck, every thing as it should be. We please 
ourselves with fine prospects of success. I say nothing about St. 
Johns, etc. presuming you know as much or more about it than I 
do. The money arrived safe here last Fryday, and I assure you 
gives a new face to our affairs, which by a greater delay must have 
run into confusion. 3 I thank you for your short letter; would have 
thanked you more if it had been longer. . . . 

Is it worth while to wonder that some people can t feel impro 
prieties? However ambition and variety I think, must predomi 
nate and mark strongly the character of a man who can act such a 
part, if he has any sense at all. I am glad to find the Congress in 
such a temper. . . . 

I must write General Court news, and plans on foot for fixing 
armed Vessels, animated by our late success. . . .

three weeks, expecting every minute the remainder of the money to be sent from Phila 
delphia. The delay is unaccountable to every one here. We are all agreed that there is some 
wickedness at the bottom, but know not where. It is suspected to be in one of the Treasur 
ers, whose principles I am told would not recommend him to the place he holds." Adams

DR SIR, I believe you will have a surfeit of Letters from me, 
for they will be as inane as they are numerous. 

The Bearer of this is Major Bayard 1 a Gentleman of this City, 
of the Presbyterian Persuasion, of the best Character, and the 
clearest affections for his Country. I have received so many Civ 
ilities from him, that I could not refuse myself the Pleasure of in 
troducing him to you. 

Our Obligations of Secrecy are so braced up, that I must deny my 
self the Pleasure of Writing Particulars. Not because some Letters 
have been intercepted, for notwithstanding the Versification of 
them, they have done good, tho they have made some People grin. 

This I can Say with Confidence, that the Propriety and Neces 
sity of the Plan of Politicks so hastily delineated in them is every 
day, more and more confessed even by those Gentlemen who dis 
approved it at the Time when they were written. 

Be assured, I never Saw So Serious and determined a Spirit as 
I see now every day. 

The high Spirited Measures you call for will assuredly come. 
Languid and disastrous Campaigns are agreeable to Nobody. 

Young Mr. Lux desires his Compts. to you and your Lady. He 
is vastly pleased with his Treatment both from you and her. 
Remember me to her. I have Shocking Letters from her Friend at 
Braintree, such as have put my Phylosophy to the Tryal. I wait 
only for another Letter to determine whether I shall come home. 2

Camp. They are both honest Whigs, and as such I am sure they 
will be duly regarded by you. 

This day Dr. Franklin setts off for Cambridge, being deputed 
by the Congress in Conjunction with Mr. Lynch of South Carolina 
and Coll. Harrison of Virginia to consult with the General and 
some Gentlemen of the four New England Colonies, concerning 
the most effectual Methods of continuing supporting and regulat 
ing the Continental Army. This Embassy I conjecture will be 
attended with great and good Consequences. 

The Intelligence received by the July Packett, which arrivd at 
New York a few days ago, has convincd some, who could not be 
prevaild upon to believe it before, that it is folly to supplicate a 
Tyrant, and that under God, our own virtuous Efforts must save 
us. I hope, that our Troops will before long force their Way into 
Boston. If such a Design should be in Contemplation I dare say 
you will encourage it to the utmost of your Power. 

Mr. Lynch is a Man of Sense and Virtue. Coll. Harrison s 
Character may be drawn from his Confidential Letter publishd 
not long ago in Madam Draper s Gazette. I hope these Gentle 
men will be treated with all the Respect which is due to the publick 
Character they sustain. I mentiond to my valuable friend Coll. 
Lee 1 (Brother of my trusty Correspondent Dr. Lee 2 of London) 
his going upon this Embassy. Indeed he could not have been well 
spared from the Congress, and therefore I was the more easily 
satisfied with his Objection, which was the Want of Health. You 
would have been exceedingly pleasd with him. 

In your Letter to Mr. J. A. you promise to write to me. I shall 
be happy in receiving your Letters by every Opportunity. If I am 
not much mistaken, a short time will afford you a delightful Sub 
ject to write upon. Our army must not long remain inactive. 
They must improve the golden Season, before the Rebels can be 
reinforced, which probably will be this Fall. 

We are expecting every Moment important News from General 
Schuyler. May God prosper our Designs in that Quarter. 

I wish you would inform me, how Affairs are carried on in Gen 
eral Assembly. Adieu. s. A. 

i Richard Henry Lee. 2 Arthur Lee.

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, Octr. 7th, 1775 

DR. SIR, The Debates and Deliberations in Congress are im 
penetrable Secrets; but the Conversations in the City and the 
Chatt of the Coffee house are free and open. Indeed I wish We 
were at Liberty to write freely and Speak openly upon every Sub 
ject, for their is frequently as much Knowledge derived from Con 
versation and Correspondence as from Solemn public Debates. 

A more intricate and complicated Subject never came into any 
Man s thoughts than the Trade of America. 1 The Questions that 
arise when one thinks of it, are very numerous. 

If the Thirteen united Colonies should immediately Surcease 
all Trade with every Part of the World what would be the Con 
sequence? In what manner, and to what degree, and how soon 
would it affect, the other Parts of the World ? how would it affect 
G. B., Ireland, the English West India Islands, the French the 
Dutch the Danish, the Spanish West India Islands? how would it 
affect the Spanish Empire on the Continent? how would it affect 
the Brazills and the Portuguese Settlements in America ? If it is cer 
tain that it would distress Multitudes in these Countries, does it 
therefore follow that it would induce any foreign Court to offer Us 
assistance, and to ask us for our Trade or any Part of it? If it is 
questionable whether foreign States would venture upon Such 
Steps, which would perhaps be Violations of Treaties of Peace, 
and certainly would light up a War in Europe, is it certain that 
Smugglers, by whom I mean private Adventurers belonging to 
foreign Nations would come here, through all the Hazards they 
must run? Could they be suffered to clear out for America in 
their own Custom houses? Would they not run the risque of 
Seizure from their own Custom House officers, or of Capture from 
their own Men of War? Would they not be liable to be visited by 
British Men of War, in any Part of the Ocean, and if found to have 
no Clearances be seized? When they arrived on any Part of the 
Coast of N. America would they not be seized by Brittish Cutters, 

i See Adams "Notes of Debates," October 4 and 5, in Journals of the Continental Con 
gress, in. 476.

Cruizers, Fenders, Frigates without Number? But if their good 
Fortune should escape all these Risques, have We harbours or 
Rivers, sufficiently fortified, to insure them Security while here? 
In their Return to their own Country would they not have the 
sameGauntlett to run? In short, if We Stop our own Ships, have 
we even a Probability that the Ships of foreign Nations, will run 
the Venture to come here, either with or without the Countenance 
and Encouragement of their several Courts or States public or 
private open or secret? It is not easy for any Man precisely and 
certainly to answer this Question. We must then say all this is 
uncertain. 

Suppose then We assume an intrepid Countenance, and send 
Ambassadors at once to foreign Courts, what Nation shall We 
court? Shall We go to the Court of France, or the Court of Spain, 
to the States General of the United Provinces? to the Court of 
Lisbon, to the Court of Prussia or Russia or Turkey or Denmark, 
or where, to any, one, more, or all of these? If we should, is there a 
Probability, that our Ambassadors would be received, or so much 
as heard or seen by any Man or Woman in Power at any of these 
Courts. He might possibly, if well skill d in intrigue, his Pocketts 
well filled with Money and his Person Robust and elegant enough, 
get introduced to some of the Misses and Courtezans in Keeping 
of the statesmen in France, but would not that be all. 

An offer of the Sovereignty of this Country to France or Spain 
would be listened to no doubt by either of those Courts, but we 
should suffer any Thing before we should offer this. What then 
can We offer? An Alliance, a Treaty of Commerce? What Secur 
ity could they have that we should keep it? Would they not reason 
thus: These People intend to make Use of us to establish an Inde 
pendency, but the Moment they have done it Britain will make 
Peace with them, and leave us in the Lurch, and we have more to 
dread from an Alliance between Britain and the United Colonies 
as an independant state, than we have now they are under one 
corrupted Administration. Would not Spain reason in the same 
manner, and say further our Dominions in South America will be 
soon a Prey to these enterprizing and warlike Americans, the 
Moment they are an independent State? Would not our Proposals 



128 Jf^arren- Adams Letters [1775 

and Agents be treated with Contempt? and if our Proposals were 
made and rejected, would not this sink the Spirits of our own 
People Elevate our Enemies and disgrace Us in Europe: 

If then, it will not be safe to Stop our own Ships entirely and 
trust to foreign Vessells coming here either with or without Con 
voy of Men of War belonging to foreign States, what is to be done? 
Can our own People bear a total Cessation of Commerce? Will not 
such Numbers be thrown out of Employment and deprived of 
their Bread, as to make a large discontented Party? Will not the 
Burthen of supporting these Numbers, be too heavy upon the 
other Part of the Community? Shall we be able to maintain the 
War, wholly without Trade? can we support the Credit of our 
Currency without it? 

If We must have Trade how shall We obtain it? 

There is one Plan, which alone, as it has ever appeared to me, 
will answer the End in some Degree, at first. But this is attended 
with So many Dangers to all Vessells, certain Loss to many, and 
So much Uncertainty upon the whole, that it is enough to make any 
Man thoughtfull. Indeed it is looked upon So wild, extravagant and 
romantic, that a Man must have a great deal of Courage and much 
Indifference to common Censure, who should dare to propose it. 

"God helps those who help themselves," and it has ever ap 
peared to me since this unhappy Dispute begun, that We had no 
Friend upon Earth to depend on but the Resources of our own 
Country, and the good sense and great Virtues of our People. We 
shall finally be obliged to depend upon ourselves. 

Our Country furnishes a vast abundance of materials for Com 
merce. Foreign Nations have great Demands for them. If We 
should publish an Invitation to any one Nation or more, or to all 
Nations, to send their ships here and let our Merchants inform 
theirs that We have Harbours where the Vessells can lie in Safety, 
I conjecture that many private foreign Adventurers would find 
Ways to send Cargoes here thro all the Risques without Convoys. 
At the Same Time our own Merchants would venture out with their 
Vessells and Cargoes, especially in Winter, and would run thro 
many Dangers, and in both these Ways together, I should hope We 
might be supplied with Necessaries. 



1775] Warren-Adams Letters 129 

All this however Supposes that We fortify and defend our own 
Harbours and Rivers. We may begin to do this. We may build 
Row Gallies, flatt bottomed Boats, floating Batteries, Whale 
Boats, Vesseaux de Frize, nay, Ships of War, how many, and how 
large I can t say. To talk of coping Suddenly with G. B. at sea 
would be Quixotism indeed, but the only Question with me is, can 
We defend our Harbours and Rivers? If We can We can trade.

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADA., Octob. 7, 1775 

DEAR SIR, Yesterday Capt. Read arrived here from London 
which place he left the 5th of August and Falmouth the nth. 

He brings Advice that there is not the least Appearance of a 
Relaxation of Ministerial Measures; That the [King] speaks of 
them with the utmost Satisfaction; that 2000 Troops are raising 
to be sent to America immediately, either to Boston or New York. 
The Parliament is to meet in November when a Bill will be brought 
in to enable our most gracious Sovereign to send for and employ 
16,000 Hessians, to subdue his Subjects in America. The Neces 
sity of the times requires the utmost Activity and Vigor on this 
side of the Atlantick. 

Pray get ready our Colony Accounts with all convenient speed. 
I am now in Congress and can add no more than that I am with 
the warmest Affection, your Friend, 

SAML. AD. 



JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

October the 8, 1775 

DEAR SIR, You will not think your Time misspent in Perusing 
any Plans for the Service of your Country, even altho they may 
prove, upon Examination chimerical. There are two Channells 
only, through which Vessells of large Burthen, can pass, to and 
from Boston; one, is between the West Head of long Island and 
the Moon: It is a mile Wide, but incumbered with Rocks and too 



130 Warren- Adams Letters [1775 

shallow for a Man of War of more than twenty Guns. The other 
is between Long Island and Deer Island, a mile and a half from 
Point to Point, the only Channell thro which capital Ships can 
pass, leads through the Narrows, between Gallop s Island and 
Lovell s Island where it is not wider, than the length of a fifty- 
Gun Ship. In the Interval between Gallop s and George s, is Nan- 
taskett Road, where five Men of War are now Stationed; for what 
other End, do you suppose, than to guard the Narrows from being 
obstructed ? 

The Moon communicates with Squantum, at low Water, even 
without a Canoe. A Fort therefore, upon Squantum may be so 
placed as to Secure a Retreat from the Moon to Squantum and 
from that to the Main; one upon the East Head of the Moon, and 
another on the West Head of long Island, Secures the Communica 
tion, and covers a Retreat from the latter to the former; another, 
on the Summit of Long Island, covers the shore on each side. A 
Strong Battery at the East Head of long Island commands the ship 
Channell, the Narrows, and Nantaskett Road, consequently by 
sinking Hulks or Vesseaux de Frise in the Narrows, We might 
prevent any Vessell of great Force from going out or coming in. 

In the Month of February last a Plan of the Town and Chart 
of the Harbour of Boston, was published in London. I think in a 
Magazine. 1 I wish you would examine this Project by that Plan, 
and give me your opinion. I dont trouble Washington with any of 
these Schemes, because I dont wish to trouble him with any Thing 
to no Purpose. But if I could command a Thousand Tons of Pow 
der and an hundred Pieces of heavy Cannon I would Scribble to 
him till he would be weary of me. Mean Time It may not be 
amiss for me to amuse myself with some of my Friends, in Specu 
lations of this kind; because some good may some time or other 
Result from them. 

Can no Use be made of Rowe Gallies, with you ? Eight or Ten 
are compleated here. Can they be used in the Vineyard Sound? 
Would not their heavy Metal demolish a Cruizer now and then? 
There is a Shipwright escaped from Boston, who [has] been several 
Years a Prisoner in a Turkish galley and has a Model of one. Coll.

Quincy knows him or I could procure you Directions from this 
Place how to construct them. 

We have just received by an express from Schuyler, very prom 
ising Intelligence concerning the operations of the Northern 
Army. Ethan Allen is in the Heart of the Country joined by 200 
Canadians. Montgomery was beginning to bombard St. Johns. 

If We should be successful in that Province, a momentous, 
political Question arises What is to be done with it? A Govern 
ment, will be as necessary for the Inhabitants of Canada as for 
those of the Massachusetts Bay, and what form of Government, 
shall it be? Shall the Canadians, choose an House of Representa 
tives, a Council and a Governor? It will not do to govern them by 
Martial Law, and make our General Governor, this will be dis 
relished by them as much as their new Parliamentary Constitu 
tion or their old French Government. 

Is there Knowledge and Understanding enough among them, 
to elect an Assembly, which will be capable of ruling them and 
then to be governed by it who shall constitute their Judges and 
civil Officers. 

This appears to me as serious a Problem as any We shall have to 
solve. [Six lines are here erased in the original letter] when I was 
at Watertown a Comtee of both Houses was appointed to Corre 
spond with Us. 1 We have not reed any Letter from it. 

Another was appointed to enquire after Virgin Lead and leaden

Discoveries. We have not heard from this Comtee. 

Please to send the enclosed News Paper to my Wife when you

DR. SIR, Mr. Jonathan Mifflin, a young Gentleman of this 
City a relation of our Friend the Quarter Master General will hand 
you this Letter. 

I believe you will have enough of my Correspondence this Time, 
for it has certainly been filled with mere Impertinence and con 
tains nothing of War or Politicks which are so agreeable to your 
Taste. 

Our Expectations are very Sanguine of Intelligence from Schuy- 
ler that Canada is ours. Our advices from England breath nothing 
but Malice, Revenge and Cruelty. 

Powder and Salt Petre are Still the Cry from one End of the 
Continent to the other. We must, and, God willing, We will have 
them. 

I long to hear concerning our Friends in Boston. My Friends 
cannot be too particular. I want to know the Condition of every 
Individual; I want to know also every Event however minute 
which Turns up in our Camp or Lines. We have most formidable 
Descriptions of Gage s Fortifications in Boston. Ninety Pieces of 
Brass Field Pieces from four to eight Pounders have certainly been 
cast in the Tower for America, and Carnages, Wheel-barrows, 
Flat bottomed Boats, etc. I am, etc.

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADA., Octob. 10, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, Since my last I have receivd Intelligence from 
London, that the British Ministry after having receivd the Advice 
of the Engagement on Bunker s Hill held various Councils on 
American Affairs and had resolvd to persevere in their Attempts 
to enslave us. 50 or 60 brass field pieces 6 and 9 pounders some 
thousand stands of small Arms with Ammunition had been shipd 
from the Tower of London for Quebeck to arm the Canadians. 
Five Regiments from Ireland, viz. I7th 27th 28th 46th and 55th 



Warren-Adams Letters 133 

were orderd to Boston. 4 Companies of the Train of Artillery 
are to go with the Ordnance and Stores to Quebeck. Several 
Ships of War were also orderd to America. What was intended for 
Quebeck were to sail in a fortnight from the Date of the Letter 
which was the 8th of August. The Regiments from Ireland were 
intended to be at Boston in October. The Parliamt. was to meet 
in Octr. and so soon, that a Sanction might be given as early as pos 
sible to the Measures that have been taken as well as others to be 
adopted. General Gage had been appointed Governor General of 
all North America, but afterwards it was concluded that Leave 
should be given him to return home. This was to make Room for 
Genl. Amherst, who is to take the Command in the Spring with a 
promise of 20,000 Men 2000 Highlanders 3000 Irish Roman 
Catholicks, and the rest, if they cannot be raised in England, to 
consist of Hannoverians, Hessians and other Germans. 1 The Plan 
said to have been laid before Ministry last Spring, which was to 
divide the Troops then sent out, a part of them to go to New York, 
is now to be followed. General Gage s Necessity then obligd him 
to alter that plan and to collect all his troops together at Boston. 
Govr. Carleton had orders to enter upon the New England Fron 
tiers with the Canadians, and Tryon with the Forces at New York 
was to meet and cooperate with him. This it is said was the De 
sign of his return to his Government. 

The idea is not given up, and to facilitate the plan a Number 
of flat bottom boats were to be constructed and so contrivd as 
when they touch the Shore, to throw down a platform that will land 
at once 6 armed Men. They may be used to fire field pieces or 
Swivel Guns. When they are compleated they are to be taken to 
pieces and sent to Canada to be used on the Lakes. It was re 
ported in England that the Officers just arrivd from Boston said, 
the Intention was to dispossess the Americans of Dorchester Neck 
which was all they thought of doing this Campaign, supposing 

I The intelligence in Boston was better. "The Cerberus Man of War, which carried 
you the News of Charlestown Battle, is Returned here after a Short Passage. She brings 
us very pleasing Accounts, such as have put new Life into Every Body; Gen l Gage goes 
home in the Pallas, a Transport Ship, and Gen l Howe is advanced to the Chief Command, 
a Man almost adored by the Army, and one that with the Spirit of a Wolfe, possesses the 
genius of a Marlborough." Samuel Paine to William Paine, October 2, 1775. A .. Hist. 
Gen. Reg., xxx. 371. 



134 Warren- Adams Letters [1775 

that by the Spring they should have Reinforcements sufficient to 
attempt any thing; especially as they concluded the Americans 
would be obligd from the Severity of the Winter to break up their 
Encampment, while the Soldiers would be in good Quarters in 
Boston. They also said that the Officers were much disgusted with 
the Service, and that it was with the utmost difficulty the Soldiers 
were compelld to fight. 

By late accounts from the Northern Army things wear a prom 
ising Aspect there. Genl. Schuyler s Success will frustrate the 
designs of Ministry in Canada. 

Letters have been intercepted here which discover a plot of 
which I have not now time to write you, as the Bearer, Mr. Mif- 
flin, of whose going I was apprizd but a few Minutes ago, is now 
waiting. I am impatient to hear the particulars of a report we 
have just heard concerning Dr. Church which astonishes me. 

Be kind enough to forward the inclosd Letter. Excuse this in 
digested account of Matters, which however comes from good 
Authority and be assured that I am with due regards to your good 
Lady and Friends most affectionately. Yours,

DR. SIR, I would write often if I had anything to communi 
cate; But obligations of Honour forbid some Communications and 
other Considerations prevent others. The common Chatt of a 
Coffee house is too frivolous for me to recollect or you to read. I 
have inclosed a Paper upon which I will make no Remark: But 
leave you to your own Conjectures only I must absolutely insist 
that it be mentioned to nobody. It may gratify your Curiosity 
and give some Relief to your Cares. 

I most earnestly pray that all my Friends would exert them 
selves to furnish me with Intelligence of a particular Nature. I 
mean with a List of all the Depredations committed upon our 
Trade; a List of all the Vessels which have been taken by the Cut 
ters, Cruizers, etc.; the Names of the Vessells, Masters, owners; 



1775] Warren- Adams Letters 135 

Burthen of the Ship, the Nature of the Cargo s, and the Value of 
both. Nothing will contribute so much to facilitate Reprisals, as 
an exact Account of our Losses and Damages. I wish our General 
Court would take it up, and examine it thoroughly. 

We have no Accounts nor Vouchers yet. Nor one Line from the 
Comtee appointed to correspond with Us. I am very happy - 
how it is I know not but I am very happy.

[ENCLOSURE] l 

As the Article of Powder is much wanted to carry on the opera 
tions vs. the Ministerial Army, and as the british Ministry have 
taken Every Step that human Nature could devise to prevent the 
Americans obtaining so essential an Article; it is humbly Submit 
ted to the wisdom of the Cont. Congress, whether it will not be 
prudent to Supply themselves with that Article at the Expence of 
the said Ministry by taking it wherever they can get it. It is there 
fore recommended that 2 Vessells properly mann d be sent to the 
Island of Antigua one of which may anchor at old Road on the 
South Side of the said Island (where there are only a few Houses) 
in the Evening under Dutch Colours; passing for a Vessell bound 
on a forced Trade, to the French Islands; in the night they may 
land, and take away all the powder; there being not above one or 
two Persons, in the fort to prevent it. As soon as the Powder is 
obtained the Vessell may proceed down to Johnsons Point Fort, 
at the S. W. point of the Island; and take what is there; there being 
only a single Matross in the said Fort; the other Vessell must be 
commanded by a prudent Man, well acquainted with the Bar and 
Harbour at St. Johns; if any Man of War be anchored without the 
Bar; it will not be prudent to attempt any Thing, but should there 
be none; the Vessell may then go over the Bar, and anchor close 
under the fort; as is commonly the Custom. There are generally 
10 or 12 Soldiers in James Fort Situated on a Point on the lar 
board Hand, Seven miles distant from the Town; the Magazine is 
in a hollow; on the Left Hand just after entering the Gate, and 
commonly contains from 500 to 1000 Blls. of Powder, or more. 

i In the writing of John Adams. 



136 Warren- Adams Letters [1775 

2 miles from thence to the northward is a Small fort called Cor- 
bresons point fort; and 2 miles from this northward is another 
Small fort called Dickensons bay fort, in either of which there is 
not above a Single Matross. All this Powder may be easily obtained 
without any Oppossition, if conducted with Prudence; it will be 
necessary that the Captn should have some Money, to distribute 
among the Soldiers, to assist in taking it away; He may go into the 
Fort in the afternoon (and See how the Land lies) under pretence 
of Sailing that night, and thereby guide his operation. 

The same Thing may be done by other Vessells at Montserrat, 
Nevis, Charles fort at Sandy point, St. Kitts, also at St. Martens; 
without any Risque. 

I would advise the continental Congress to make a general 
Sweep of all the Powder, at St. Eustatius, it may first be taken and 
then paid for afterwards as the Dutch refuse to sell it to us; I am 
well persuaded the whole of this Plan may be executed, and that 
near 3000 Blls of powder may be obtained in the Course of 3 or 4 
months. 

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, Octr. 13, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, Your obliging Favour of the fifth Inst. 1 I this 
Moment received and give me Leave to assure you that no Letter 
I ever received gave me greater Pleasure. In truth, sir, I have 
been under some Apprehensions, that a certain Passage, in a very 
unfortunate as well as inconsiderate Letter, might have made 
some disagreeable Impressions on your Mind; I was indeed re 
lieved in some Degree by Accounts which I had from Gentlemen 
who knew your sentiments, especially such as were present when 
you first heard it read. The candid, genteel and generous Manner 
in which it was heard and animadverted on, gave me great Satis 
faction: I had thoughts of writing you on the Subject, but was hin 
dered by certain Notions of Delicacy, perhaps as whimsical as any 
Thing alluded to in that Letter. But I rejoice exceedingly, that 
this incident has induced you to write. 

I Not found. 



1775] Warren- Adams Letters 137 

I frankly confess to you that a little whim and Eccentricity so 
far from being an objection to any one in my Mind, 1 is rather 
a Recommendation, at first Blush, and my Reasons are, because 
few Persons in the World, within my Experience or little Reading, 
who have been possessed of Virtues or Abilities, have been en 
tirely without them, and because few Persons, have been remark 
able for them, without having something at the same Time, truly 
valuable in them. 

I confess farther that a Fondness for Dogs, by no means depre 
ciates any Character in my Estimation, because many of the 
greatest Men have been remarkable for it; and because I think it 
Evidence of an honest Mind and an Heart capable of Friendship, 
Fidelity and Strong Attachments being the Characteristicks of 
that Animal. 

Your opinion of my Generosity, Valour, Good Sense, Patriotism 
and Zeal for the Rights of Humanity is extreamly flattering to me; 
and I beg leave to assure you, in the strongest Manner and I flatter 
myself that my Language and Conduct in public and private upon 
all Occasions, notwithstanding the wanton Expressions in the 
intercepted Letter, have demonstrated that this Opinion is recip 
rocal. Your Sincerity, sir, I never doubted, any more than I did 
my own, when I expressed or implied an Opinion of your Attain 
ments as a Schollar and a Soldier. Indeed I might have expressed 
a much higher opinion of these than I did, with the same Sincerity. 
But enough of this. 

At the Story of the Surgeon General 2 I stand astonished. A 
Man of Genius, of Learning, of Family, of Character, a Writer of 
Liberty Songs and good ones too, a Speaker of Liberty orations, a 
Member of the Boston Committee of Correspondence, a Member 
of the Massachusetts Congress, an Agent for that Congress to the 
Continental Congress, a Member of the House, a Director Gen 
eral of the Hospital and Surgeon General Good God! What 
shall We say of human Nature? What shall We say of American 
Patriots? or rather what will the World Say? The World however 
will not be too severe. Indeed, Sir, We ought to expect in a Con 
test like this, however we may detest, such Examples as this. 

i A hit in favor of Charles Lee. ^ Church. 



138 Warren- Adams Letters [1775 

History furnishes Instances more or less, in all Quarrels like this. 
The Drs. Brother Poet Waller in the Struggle with a Stuart, was 
his Antitype. We cannot be too cautious of the Persons We en 
trust, in such Times as these: Yet We ought not to let our Caution 
degenerate into groundless Jealousy. There is a Medium between 
Credulity on one hand and a base suspicious Temper on the other 
from which We need not be induced to deviate even in such 
Times as these and by such Examples as the Drs. 

The Nature of the Conspiracy and the Duration and Extent of 
it seem as yet in much obscurity. I hope Time and Care will 
bring the whole Truth to light that exact and impartial Justice 
may be done, if that is possible. 

Before this Reaches you, a Comtee. from Congress will tell you 
News from hence. I wish, sir that I could write freely to you con 
cerning our Proceedings; But you know the obligations I am under 
to be upon the Reserve: and the danger there would be as I know 
not the Carrier of this Letter, if I was at perfect Liberty. But this 
I must say, that I see no danger of our "displaying Timidity." 
This Congress, is more united, and more determined than ever. 
And if the petrified Tyrants would but send us their Ultimatum, 
which is expected soon, you would see Us, in Earnest. 

As to confiscating Estates, that is but a small Part of what will 
be done when We are engaging seriously. 

You began upon a Subject, towards the Close of your Letter of 
infinite Importance; I read with avidity your Thoughts and was 
much chagrin d that you gave me so few of them. The Intricacy 
and Multiplicity of the Questions involved in it, require more ex 
tensive Knowledge and a larger Mind than mine to determine 
them with Precision. There is so much Uncertainty too, that I 
believe no Man is capable of deciding with Precision; but it must 
be left to Time Accident and Experience, to begin and improve 
the Plan of our Trade. 

If We should invite "all the Maritime Powers of the World into 
our Ports," would any one of them come? At least, untill they 
should be convinced that We were able, and determined to fight 
it out with G. B. to the last? Are they yet convinced of this, or will 
they be very soon? Besides, if they should, Would it be Sound 



i?75] Warren- Adams Letters 139 

Policy in Us to admit them? Would it not be sounder to confine 
the Benefit and the Bargain to one or a few? 

Is it not wiser to send our own Ships to all maritime Powers, 
and admit private adventurers from foreign Nations, if by any 
Means We can defend them against Cutters and Cruizers, or 
teach them to elude them. I have upon this Subject a System of 
my own but am not bigoted to it, nor to any other. You will 
oblige me vastly by your Sentiments at large.

Yours of October I and 2d I received this Morning with the 
Letters inclosed. These were from my afflicted Wife giving me 
such a continued History of her Distresses, as has affected me too 
much to write you a long Letter. 

The Misfortune, or what shall I call it, of the Surgeon General 
had been represented here in several Letters in very glaring Col 
ours, until one arrived from the secretary to the general, couched 
in Terms of more Temper and Candour. By your Account, and 
indeed by the Letter itself it appears an unaccountable Affair. 
Balaam praying for Leave to curse Israel, is the Emblem. A mani 
fest Reluctance at hurting his Country, yet desirous of making a 
Merit, with the other Side what shall we think? Is there rea 
son to believe that other Letters have gone the same Way? I was 
so little acquainted with the World that I never heard a Suspicion 
to the Disadvantage of his Moral Character untill I was lately 
with you at the Adjournment. I should scarcely have joined in a 
certain Recommendation, if I had heard before what I heard then; 
for Honour and Fidelity violated in Such gross Instances in private 
Life are slender securities in public. Be not concerned about your 
Friends at the Congress. Their Recommendations will not be dis 
credited by this Event. Gentlemen here have behaved universally 
with the Utmost Politeness, upon this Occasion, they say they 
pitty us, for the Suspicions that there is danger may arise among us 
of one another, and the Hurt to that Confidence in one another 



140 Warren- Adams Letters [1775 

which ought to be. But any Man ought to be kick d for a Brute 
that shall reproach Us in Thought, Word or Deed on this Account. 

Our accounts from Schuyler s Army are as agreable as yours 
from Arnold. We are in hourly Expectation. 

Rejoice to hear of your Successes by Sea. Let Cargill 1 and 
Obrien 2 be put into continental service immediately I pray. 

We begin to feel a little of a Seafaring Inclination here. 

The Powder at Quebec, will place us all upon the Top of the 
House. 

Your Letters are very usefull to me, and I cannot have too 
many or too long. 

I believe We shall take some of the twenty Gun Ships before 
long. We must excite by Policy that kind of exalted Courage, 
which is^ever victorious by sea and land which is irresistable. 
The Saracens, had it the Knights of Malta the Assassins - 
Cromwell s soldiers and sailors. Nay, N. England men have ever 
had it hitherto. They never yet f aild in an Attempt of any Kind.

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, Octob. 13, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, It is now more than a Month since we arrivd 
in this City. I have receivd but one Letter and for that I am much 
indebted to you. I thought our Assembly had appointed a Com 
mittee to transmit Intelligence to us. We hear nothing from them. 
Have they no Intelligence of Importance to send to us? If so, let 
them inform us even of that, and we will pay the Postage of their 
Letter. But surely it is of some Importance that we should know 
whether C[hurch] is a Traitor or not that on the one hand we 
might joyn like disinterested Patriots in execrating him, or, on 
the other hand, in vindicating the Character of an unfortunate 
Friend. Our pride is sorely mortified when there are Grounds to 
suspect that so eminent a Countryman is become a Traitor. Jhz 
Fool will say in his heart, there is no such thing in the World as 

1 The exploit is that on p. 100, supra.

publick Spirit. The most virtuous Citizen will be suspected of 
concealing his dishonest Designs under a Cloak of Zeal for his 
Country and the brightest Examples will lose their Influence. 

I am very sollicitous that our Army, if it be practicable, should 
make a resolute Attack upon the Rebels before a Reinforcement 
to them shall arrive, which I think may be depended upon very 
soon. Genl. Gage I understand is already gone for England. This 
verifies a part of the Intelligence which I gave you in my last Let 
ter. Howe will remain in Command till the Spring, when Amherst 

will come out as strong as they can make him. It is said that 1 

usd his utmost Power of Dissimulation (and he is as great a Master 
of it as Mansfield or Hutchinson) to prevail on him to undertake 
the Command. Among the officers of the British Army, the slav 
ish Maxim "the Will of the Prince is Law" too much prevails. 
They will suffer the arbitrary and cruel Commands of their Sov 
ereign to supersede the Dictates of Honor, Morality, and Con 
science. I fear there are few, if more than one Effingham 2 to be 
found in Britain. I have thought there was more of the true prin 
ciple of Honor in the British Army, than among any other publick 
Class. If this be a Truth it is a melancholy one, for it is greatly to 
be apprehended that there is not Virtue enough in the Nation to 
save it. We know by long Experience that there is not Virtue 
enough there to save America. Why then should America expect 
it from Britain. This fond Hope of a Change from violent to 
lenient Measures in Britain is the Rock which endangers the 
Shipwreck of America. 

This Instant is arrivd an authentick Account of Dr. Church s 
Affair and a Copy of the Letter he had intended to send into Bos 
ton. To me it appears to be a very unintelligible Letter. I have 
not indeed thoroughly examined it. I have only heard it read. I 
do not recollect that it in any measure was calculated to expose 
the Weakness of our Army, which a Traitor, would gladly have 
seizd the Opportunity of doing, especially as he might have done 
it at that time with great Truth. The Union of Individual Colonies

and of the Continental Congress, and their firmness and Resolu 
tion are picturd in high Colours. He informs of the Arrival of 
large Quantities of Gunpowder at a time when he knew there was 
the greatest Scarcity and was sollicking his Friends here to take 
every Method for providing as he expressd it that "unum neces- 
sarium." Other parts of his Letter wear a different Complection, 
such as his mentioning the Defeat of our Army at Bunker Hill as 
"lucky"; his attempting three times in vain to send in his Letter, 
the messenger in the third Attempt being taken up (which I do not 
recollect to have heard before) and the Manner in which this Let 
ter was conceald. But I will quit this disagreeable Subject and 
conclude with assuring you that I am very affectionately yours,

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

Octr. 1 8, 1775 

DR. SIR, The Letter of Dr [Church] is the oddest Thing imag 
inable. There are so many Lies in it, calculated to give the Enemy 
an high Idea of our Power and Importance, as well as so many 
Truths tending to do us good that one knows not how to think 
him treacherous: Yet there are several Strokes, which cannot be 
accounted for at least by me, without the Supposition of Iniquity. 

In Short I endeavor to suspend my Judgment. Don t let us 
abandon him for a Traitor without certain Evidence. 

But there is not so much Deliberation in many others, or so 
much Compassion. 

The Congress declined entering into any Discussion of the Evi 
dence, or any Determination concerning his Guilt or the Nature of 
his Offence. 

But in general they had a full Conviction that it was so gross an 
Imprudence at least and was so Suspicious, that it became them 
to dismiss him from their Service, which they did instantly. 

Yesterday they chose a Successor, Dr. Morgan l an eminent 
Surgeon of this City. We as usual had our Men to propose, Dr. 

i John Morgan (1725-1789). He was dismissed from his office in January, 1777, and 
a sharp controversy followed, in which he held the advantage. 



i775l Warren- Adams Letters 143 

Hall, Jackson, and Dr. Forster. But Dr. Forster s Sufferings and 
services, and Dr. Jackson s great Fame, Experience and Merits 
were pleaded in vain. 

There is a fatality attends our Province. It Seems destined to 
fall into Contempt. It was destined that We should make Mis 
takes I think, in our Appointment of General Delegates, Surgeons, 
and every Thing else, except Paymaster and Judge Advocate. I 
hope they will not turn Cowards, Traytors, nor Lubbers; if they 
do I shall renounce all. 

Dr. Morgan will be with you soon. He is Professor of Medecine 
in the Colledge here, and reads Lectures in the Winter. He is a 
Brother of Mr. Duche and of our Mr. Stillman. I may write you 
more particularly about him another Time. 

Let me close now with a matter of some Importance. Congress 
have appointed Deane, Wythe and your servant a Committee to 
collect a just Account of the Hostilities committed by the minis 
terial Troops and Navy, in America, since last March; with proper 
Evidence of the Truth of the Facts related, the Number and Value 
of the Buildings destroyed by them, also the Number and Value of 
the Vessells inward and outward bound, which have been Seized 
by them, since that Period, also the Stock taken by them from 
different Parts of the Continent: We shall write to the Assemblies 
of New England and Virginia at least, but we shall likewise write 
to many Individuals requesting their Assistance and to you among 
others. I wish you would think a little and consult with others 
concerning this Business for it nearly concerns our Province to 
have it well done.

Octr. 19, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, It was the latter end of August that I left you. 
All September has run away, and 19 days in Octr. and We have had 
no regular Intelligence from Watertown or Cambridge. Your 
Goodness I acknowledge. But there was a Committee of both 
Houses appointed, to correspond with your Delegates; and We 



144 Warren- Adams Letters [1775 

were to be informed of every Thing that occurred in Boston, Cam 
bridge, Roxbury, Watertown, etc., especially of every Thing 
which passed in Either House; But have never received a single 
Letter not even a Scratch of a Pen from this Comtee. or any 
Member of it, unless you are one, which I dont know that you are. 
Should be glad to hear if this Committee, is all defunct or not. 

I have, in almost every Letter I have written, to any of my 
Friends, entreated that We might have accounts and Vouchers 
sent Us, that We might obtain a Reimbursement of some Part at 
least of the inordinate Expence that has fallen upon Us. But have 
received No answer from any one, concerning it. I wish to be in 
formed, however, what the Difficulty is, that lies in the Way, if 
We cannot have the Accounts, etc. The Continental Money 
goes away so fast, that I greatly fear We shall have none left in the 
Treasury, before We get the Proper Evidence and Information to 
obtain a Reimbursement for our Province. Dollars go but little 
Way in Maintaining Armies very costly Commodities indeed. 
The Expence already accrued will astonish Us all I fear. 

Congress has appointed a Comtee Deane, Wythe and your 
servant to collect a Narration of Hostilities, and Evidence to 
prove it, to ascertain the Number and Value of the Buildings 
destroyed, Vessells captivated, and Cattle plundered, etc., every 
where. I hope We shall tell a true Story, and then I am sure it will 
be an affecting one. We shall not omit their Butcheries, nor their 
Robberies, nor their Piracies. But we shall want Assistance from 
every Quarter. I want the Distresses of Boston painted by Dr. 
Cooper s Pencil. 1 Everything must be supported by Affidavits. 
This will be an usefull Work for the Information of all the Colonies 
of what has passed in Some, for the Information of our Friends 
in England, and in all Europe, and all Posterity. Besides it may 
pave the Way to obtain Retribution and Compensation, but this 
had better not be talked of at present. The Committee will write 

I The Committee of Safety of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress was instructed 
to "draw up and transmit to Great Britain, a fair and impartial account of the late 
battle of Charlestown, as soon as possible." The Committee, being exceedingly crowded 
with business, desired the Rev. Dr. William Cooper, the Rev. Mr. William Gordon and 
the Rev. Mr. Peter Thacher to draw up a true statement, journals of ihe Provincial Con 
gress (Mass.), 594. No report appears to have been made. The Continental Congress 
took up the matter with an equal want of results. See p. 162, infra. 



7751 Warren- Adams Letters 145 

to the Assemblies, and to private Gentn. No Pains or Expense will 
be Spared I hope to render the Execution of this Commission com- 
pleat. It concerns our Province very much.

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

Octr. 19, 1775 

DR. SIR, What Think you of an American Fleet? I don t Mean 
100 ships of the Line, by a Fleet, but I suppose this Term may be 
applied to any naval Force consisting of several Vessells, tho the 
Number, the Weight of Metal, or the Quantity of Tonnage may 
be small. 

The Expence would be very great true. But the Expence 
might be born and perhaps the Profits and Benefits to be obtained 
by it, would be a Compensation. A naval Force might be created 
which would do something. It would destroy Single Cutters and 
Cruisers. It might destroy small Corvets or Fleets of these like 
Wallace s at R. Island and Ld. Dunmores at Virginia. It might 
oblige our Enemies to sail in Fleets. For two or three Vessells of 
36 and twenty Guns, well armed and manned might attack and 
carry a 64 or a 70 or a 50 Gun Ship. 

But, there is a great Objection to this. All the Trade of Pennsyl 
vania, the Lower Counties, a great Part of Maryland and N. Jersey 
Sails in between the Capes of Delaware Bay. And if a strong Fleet 
should be posted in that Bay, Superiour to our Fleet it might 
obstruct all the Trade of this River. 

Further the Trade of Virginia and the rest of Maryland floats 
into Cheasapeak Bay between the Capes of Henry and Charles 
where a Fleet might stop all. Besides Virginia and Maryland have 
no Navigation of their own nor any Carpenters to build ships. 
Their whole Trade is carried on in British Bottoms by British, 
most of it by North British Merchants. These Circumstances 
distinguish them quite from New England, where the Inlets are 
innumerable and the Navigation all their own. 

They agree that a Fleet, would protect and secure the Trade of 
New England but deny that it would that of the Southern Colonies. 



146 Warren- Adams Letters [1775 

Will it not be difficult to persuade them then to bear the Ex 
pense of building a Fleet, merely for N. England. We are Specu 
lating now about Things at a Distance. Should we be driven to a 
War at all Points, a Fleet a public Fleet as well as privateers might 
make prey enough of the Trade of our Enemies to make it worth 
while. 

[No signature.] 

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

Octr. 19, 1775 

DR. SIR, I want to be with you, Tete a Tete, to canvass, and 
discuss the complicated subject of Trade. I say nothing of private 
Consultations or public Debates, upon this important Head. 
When I write you Letters you must expect nothing from me but 
unconnected Scraps and broken Hints. Continual Successions of 
Company allow me Time only to Scrawl a Page of Paper, without 
Thought. 

Shall we hush the Trade of the whole Continent and not permit 
a Vessell to go out of our Harbours except from one Colony to 
another? How long will or can our People bear this? I say they 
can bear it forever. If Parliament should build a Wall of Brass, at 
low Water Mark, We might live and be happy. We must change 
our Habits, our Prejudices our Palates, our Taste in Dress, Fur 
niture, Equipage, Architecture, etc., but We can live and be happy. 
But the Question is whether our People have Virtue enough to be 
mere Husbandmen, Mechanicks and Soldiers? That they have 
not Virtue enough to bear it always I take for granted. How long 
then will their Virtue last? till next Spring? If We Stop all Trade 
G. B. I. and W. I. will not be furnished with any Thing. 

Shall We then give Permission for our Vessells to go to foreign 
Nations, if they can escape the Men of War? Can they escape the 
Men of War? How many will escape in Proportion? If any Escape, 
will they not venture to Britain, Ireland, and W. I. in defyance of 
our Association? If they do not will not the British Dominions 
furnish themselves with our Produce from foreign Ports, and 
thereby avoid that Distress, which We expect will overtake them? 



1775] Warren- Adams Letters 147 

Will not the W. I. Islands especially, who cannot exist without 
our Provisions for 6 Months, unless Glou[cester(?)and] Walker 
were ignorant. 

If We should invite other maritime Powers, or private adven 
turers from foreign Nations to come here, Will they venture? They 
run the risque of escaping Men of War, and the Dangers of an 
unknown Coast. Maps and Charts may give Strangers a confused 
Idea of the Geography of our Country, and of the Principal Inlets 
of Harbours, Rivers, Creeks, Coves, Islands, etc., but without 
skillful Pilots, the danger of Shipwreck will be 10 to one. 

This vast object is never out of my Mind. Help me to grapple 
it. The W. I., Barbadoes particularly, begin, We are told here by a 
late Vessell, to be terrified out of their Wits.

ABIGAIL ADAMS TO MERCY WARREN 

BRAINTREE, October 19, 1775 

I thank my Friends for their kind remembrance of me last 
week. The Letter enclosed was dated one day after that I received 
a week before and containd no publick intelegance. I have been 
Expecting Letters by the Gentlemen who I hear have arrived, but 
fear I have not any as there are none come to hand. I thought I 
should hear oftener from Philadelphia this fall, than I had ever 
done before; but I never before had so few Letters, or found the 
communication so difficult. 

I wish, my Friend, you would be kind enough to write me often 
whilst you tarry at Watertown, and let your Letters be of the 
journal kind ; by that mean I could participate in your amusements, 
in your pleasures, and in your Sentiments which would greatly 
gratify me, and I should collect the best of inteligance. 

Pray, Sir, is this request unreasonable? I would not ask any 
thing willingly which might be deemd so? If it is not, will you use 
your influence in obtaining for me this favour? It is Matter of 
Speculation what the errant of these Gentlemen is. Some Suppose 
one thing, some an other. 

What do you immagine will be the consequence if a certain 



148 barren- Adams Letters [1775 

Letter writer 1 should escape without very severe punishment? 
Would there or not be Suspicions in the minds of people preju 
dicial to those in power? The Country appear much exasperated, 
and would say he was not the only traitor. 

You have not wrote me what you think of the intercepted Let 
ters, nor of the ridiculous pharaphrase. I wish you would be kind 
eno to return the coppy of the Letters when ever you have done 
with them. 

I hear Mrs. Miflin is come to the Headquarters, if you see her, 
please to present my compliments to her. I want to know all that 

passes, curiosity you see natural to me as a , but I know who 

has as much and therefore can excuse a reasonable share of it in 
her Friend. 

My best regards attend Mrs. Wintrope when you see her, When 
do you expect to return? I hope I shall see more of you then and 
have the pleasure of both your company s much oftener. I fear I 
shall not see you at Watertown. I feel but little inclination to go 
into company. I have no Son big enough to accompany me, and 
two women cannot make out so well, as when they are more natu 
rally coupled. I do not fancy riding thro Roxbury with only a 
female partner. So believe you will not see Your

dom I take in recommending him to your Notice. It is for the Sake

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
WATERTOWN, October 20, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, After an interval much longer than I ever 
designed should take place, I now sit down to write again. The 
multiplicity of business, and the crowd of company here, must be 
my excuse. Every body either eats, drinks or sleeps in this house, 
and very many do all, so that for a week past I could get no oppor 
tunity to write, morning, noon, or night. The committee of Con 
gress arrived here last Sunday. Colonel Harrison went through 
[the] town without my seeing him. Doctor Franklin and Mr. Lynch 
stop d at Davis. I waited on them, and they came over and drank 
coffee with us. The next day I dined with them all at Head 
quarters, and yesterday they and the general officers, and the 
gentlemen of character from the southward on a visit here, were 
entertained by the House at Coolidge s, 1 on the best dinner we 
could get for them, turtle, codfish, etc. Every kind of civility and 
mark of respect is shewn them here, and if they don t leave us 
better satisfied than they came to us, it will not be our faults. 
From the little conversation I have had with them, which has been 
as much as could be got in a crowd, I presume they will. I am 
much pleased with them. Doctor Franklin, who[m] I never saw 
before, appears venerable in the characters of a gentleman, a phy 
sician, and statesman. I think Mr. Lynch very sensible and judi 
cious, and all of them firmly attached to the good cause, and I 
flatter myself their zeal will not be abated by this visit. In my last

short billet I forgot to congratulate you on your appointment to 
the Supreme Bench of justice here, and I expect the first seat, as 
no doubts are made of it, tho they are not yet ranked. Four only 
are appointed, Mr. Adams, Mr. Gushing, Mr. Read, and Mr. 
Sergeant. The Board voted by ballot for those that should be 
nominated, and with the four mentioned voted Mr. Sever, but 
from his diffidence, etc., he prevailed not to be nominated. Where 
the next appointment will fall I can t tell. Some of Paine s friends 
had it in contemplation to have him nominated, but gave it up 
after you was appointed, very naturally supposing he could not be 
ranked before you, and he having previously declared to them 
that he would not serve in an inferiour station, As every body 
must know he was your superiour. I am told they have a design 
to nominate him King s Attorney. How far his acceptance of that 
place is to be reconciled to his declaration you may judge. Lowell 
seems to stand no chance, at least till he has served an apprentice 
ship in Purgatory. This appointment if you accept it will cooper 
ate with your wishes expressed in several letters to leave the 
Congress. Indeed we want you here, for this and divers other 
reasons; but how to be reconciled to your leaving the Congress I 
can t tell. 1 I shall certainly, when such an event takes place, lose 
some share of my confidence in, and reverence for that august 
body. We have passed a bill for the judges holding their commis 
sions quam diu se bene gesserint, but could not compleat their inde 
pendency by established salaries. 2 As for the town of Boston, it 
continues in the same miserable situation. A few deserters come 
out, and of late several of the inhabitants have stole out in boats, 
among the rest our friend Hitchburne the night before last. One 
man who got out last night has just called on me. He says one 
reason of their running all hazards to get out is the threats of forc 
ing them to take arms. They all give the same general account 
that fresh provisions are very scarce, lid. sterling per pound, and 
no vegetables; the meat excessive poor; that the troops have not 
been served with it but twice during the summer and fall; that

their duty is very severe, and they continue sickly, about 150x5 in 
the hospitals; that they suppose Canada is in our hands, and are 
not elated with any certain expectation of reinforcements. They 
are apprehensive of an attack, were hove into great confusion a 
few nights ago by Admiral Putnam, who went down into the Bay 
with our floating batteries, etc., and fired some shot into the town, 
which interrupted their ball, and the acting of a play they were 
then engaged in, and their repose for the night. A misfortune 
attended this expedition, which contributed to their relief and cost 
us the loss of two men killed and six wounded. A gun split in one 
of the batteries, and destroyed her also. Gage sailed about ten 
days ago, and is succeeded by Howe. Gill, Leach and Edes s son 1 
are out of gaol. Lovel still remains. It is said he refuses to come 
out, but I doubt that. Several armed vessels are fixing by the 
General, and we have passed a bill to encourage individuals to 
fix out others. We have just received an account that they have 
been cannonading Falmouth, Casco Bay, and that Wallace, the 
pirate at Newport, has insisted on the removal of the troops from 
Rhode Island, or he will destroy Newport, and shewn instructions 
to the Committee there to destroy four towns, among which are 
Plymouth and Machias. The others I can t learn. This account 
the Governour, Cooke, 2 has just received. Please to tell Colonel 
Hancock I have the honour to be ranked a damned rebel with him. 
Upon hearing we were concerned in a brigantine bound to London 
the beginning of September, they sent out a cruiser on purpose for 
her, took her, carryed her in, condemned her and cargo, and 
ordered them sold. Our accounts, or rather the delay of them, has 
given me infinite pain. We are determined to exert ourselves, and 
prepare them as soon as possible. In the mean time shall forward 
you an application which tho a lumping one is not, perhaps, far 
from the truth. I wish it may have a favourable reception. It 
is impossible to describe the field of business before us, rendered 
still more difficult and embarrassing by the multitude of new 
questions out of the common road. When are we to see the re 
solves upon which is grounded the credit of your bills? The misers 
will soon be started upon that question. I will thank you for the

establishment of my office. You wrote me it was one hundred dol 
lars per month. 1 Colonel Hancock had every other establishment 
here but that. Our army are in much the same state they have 
been for some time past, as vigorous spirited as ever, and more 
healthy than they have been, well secured by impenetrable lines. 
So far we are prepared for the defensive. When we are to be so 
for the offensive I know not. I suppose that depends much on 
having a large quantity of a certain article, with which we have 
never yet abounded. We have no news from Colonel Arnold 
since he left Norridgwalk. I flatter myself he is before this in 
Quebeck, where are large quantities of warlike stores, not less than 
10,000 barrels powder. They would be a grand acquisition, but 
I can hardly hope that they will be so stupid as not to take care 
to prevent it by setting them afloat. We have no late news from 
St. Johns. We begin to grow impatient. 

The 21 st. The conference I am told is to be finished this day. 
I know little about it. There seems to be such a reservedness 
among those concerned here, that my pride won t permit me to ask 
many questions. By the way, the Committee of Council are Colo 
nel Otis, 2 Mr. Sever, 3 and Mr. Spooner, 4 to whom has since been 
added Bowdoin, 5 who lately came to town and took his seat at the 
Board. I believe your committee were very soon convinced that 
the soldiers never had less wages. The bounty given on an average 
last war, I suppose might be set at 8; sometimes we gave 12, 
and one year 14, tho at first less than 8, which will make at 
least 20 / per month to be added to 367, the wages then given. 
We now give them a coat upon an average about 247, which will 
make 37 to be added to 407. A blanket they had in both cases. 
It will from these facts be easy to infer that they then had 137 at 
least per month more than now. 

I have given you before a minute detail of Church s affair. I 
have learnt that you are furnished with a copy of the letter, or 
should not fail to send one. I am told that he continues with great 
confidence, or rather impudence, to assert his innocence, and,

against common sense and the most flagrant evidence, to pretend 
he was serving his country. JThis is, indeed, Hutchinson like, 
affronting to our understandings. I have never seen him; I never 
wish to again. You know I hate an apostate, I hate a traitor. 
How he is to receive an adequate punishment is I suppose a ques 
tion for your determination. I am sensible of the deficiencies in 
your code of laws, and the objections to post facto laws; but some 
thing must be done, and he made an example of, or the people 
will suppose us all traitors, and lose their confidence in what we 
say or do. Our House are adjusting the ceremonies of proceeding 
in order of expulsion, and then will end our tether. 1 

I believe it is time to think of concluding this letter, or never 
expecting you to wish for another; but before I do, I must and do 
thank you heartily and fervently for your several letters received 
by Major Bayard, the gentlemen of your committee, and yester 
day by Mr. Mifflin. Tho you communicate no secrets, I can see 
and taste the traces of that extensive system of policy which 
always marks your way, and which I hope will be adopted. Your 
last has led me into a sea so extensive and deep, that my small 
abilities have not yet been able either to fathom the bottom or 
descry the shore. However, I shall rally them, and if I have vanity 
enough to suppose I can strike out one particle of light on so grand 
and important a subject, shall certainly attempt it in my next, 
which will soon follow this, if opportunity presents. In the mean 
time your maxim "God helps those who help themselves" recurs 
to mind. We are in a storm and must make a port. We must exert 
ourselves in some of the ways you mention. I think we must have 
trade and commerce. I see no difficulty in admitting it in our own 
bottoms consistently with the association, if individuals will haz 
ard their interest, and opening our ports to foreigners, one or 
more. If you could see me at this instant, you would think that 
the embarrassments and hurry of business on hand would by no 
means admit of discussions of this kind. The great objects some 
of us would wish to confine our House to are, the manufacturing 
salt petre and fire arms, the regulating the militia and fixing out

armed Vessels. The first is in a good way in Connecticut. We have 
sent Doctor Whiting l there to learn the process and art, and since 
his return have directed him to try the experiment here. I am not 
able to inform you of his success. The next I think we shall suc 
ceed in. The two others are under consideration, and a bill for the 
last in great forwardness, so far as relates to individuals. We have 
a difficulty with regard to the militia from a construction in our 
House of your resolve, giving them a power to appoint officers. 
I wish it could be explained. 

The 22d. We have just heard that the pirates on the Eastern 
shore have destroyed two-thirds of Falmouth burnt down, and 
have orders to destroy every sea port from Boston to Pemmaquid. 
This is savage and barbarous in the highest stage. What can we 
wait for now? What more can we want to justifie any step to 
take, kill and destroy, to refuse them any refreshments, to appre 
hend our enemies, to confiscate their goods and estates, to open our 
ports to foreigners, and if practicable to form alliances, etc., etc. 

Hitchburne was to see me last evening. He seems distressed to 
approve his conduct to us relative to the letters. Very little of a 
publick kind can I learn from him more than we have from others. 
He says they dread and apprehend the erecting batteries on Dor 
chester Hill and Noddle s Island. The first will drive them from 
their lines on the Neck, and the other make it impossible for ships 
to lay in the harbour, I mean above the Castle. I wish and hope 
we may be able to effect it. One piece of good news I had like to 
have forgot. A Vessel is arrived at Sheepscot with a very consid 
erable quantity of powder, cannon, and arms. I believe she be 
longs to the Massachusetts Bay Colony. 

I shall endeavour to see and form a judgment of your plan as 
soon as I can procure the chart. The row gallies you have at 
Philadelphia may be very serviceable in smooth water, but if I 
am rightly informed would not do in a sea. No doubt such might 
be constructed as would, but I am inclined to think that our can 
non armed Vessels, especially as we can be so superiour in men, 
and are more used to them, will answer the purpose better, if we 
choose such as sail well.

I am sensible of the importance of the question you propose 
about the government of Canada. It is indeed a curious problem, 
and I am glad it is in such good hands. I never expected you

The spirit of indolence is too prevalent. There is in the western 
parts of this Province a lead mine of three miles in length which 
affords one half pure lead. It is said the country abounds with 
sulphur; we want nothing but salt petre. I trust Providence will 
give us that. I cannot inclose you any of Mother Draper s papers,

There is Beef and Pork and Poultry, and Mutton and Venison

these are Trifles in a Contest for Liberty. 

But is there Temperance, Fortitude and Perseverance enough 
among the People to endure Such a Mortification of their Appe

So complicated with the landed Interest, as to produce a general 
Impatience and Uneasiness, under Restrictions so severe?

not go to England, and on Board of British Men of War? 

Shall We not lose a large Property in Navigation which will 
rot by the Wharves ? 

On the other Hand if We give Liberty Trade, will not most of 
our Vessells be seized? Perhaps all but those of the Tories who 
may be priviledged. *-

DEAR SIR, I believe I shall surfeit you with Letters, which 
contain nothing, but Recommendations of Gentlemen to your 
Attention, especially as you have so many important Affairs to 
take up all your Time and Thoughts. 

But the Bearers are Gentlemen, who come so well recommended 
to me that I could not refuse myself the Pleasure of giving them 
an Opportunity of seeing my Friend Warren, of whom you must 
know I am very proud. The Name of one of them is John Folwell, 
the other Josiah Hart, each of them a Captain of a Company of 
Militia in the County of Bucks in this Province. Mr. Joseph Hart 
the Father of one of them has exerted himself with much Success 
in procuring Donations for Boston. 

These Travellers visit the Camp from the best Motive that 
of gaining Knowledge in the military Art by Experience, that 
their Country may have the Use of it, whenever there shall be an 
Opportunity. 

You will greatly oblige them by giving them a Letter to General 
Thomas, and by introducing them to such Persons and Places as 
will best answer the honest and usefull End they have in View. 

I could wish them as well as other Strangers introduced to H. 
Knox and young Josiah Waters, 1 if they are anywhere about the 
Camp. These Young Fellows if I am not mistaken would give 
strangers no contemptible Idea of the military Knowledge of 
Massachusetts men] in the sublimest Chapters of the Art of War. 

Salt Petre is certainly making in considerable Quantities in 
several Places. I wish to know what success Dr. Whiting has. 

You wonder that certain Improprieties are not felt. Well you 
may. But I have done finding fault I content myself with 
blushing alone, and mourning in Secret, the Loss of Reputation 
our Colony Suffers, by giving Such Samples of her Sons to the 
World. Myself, remember the worst Sample of all. Pray change 
it.

DEAR SIR, We must bend our Attention to Salt Petre. We 
must make it. While B. is Mistress of the Sea and has so much 
Influence with foreign Courts, We cannot depend upon a Supply 
from abroad. 

It is certain that it can be made here, because it is certain that 
it has been formerly and more latterly. Dr. Graham, of White 
Plains in the Colony of New York told me, that he has made some 
thousands of Pounds Weight, many years ago, by Means of a 
German Servant whom he bought and found to be good for noth 
ing else. 

Messrs. De Witts, one of Windham the other of Norwich, have 
made a considerable Quantity, a sample of which has been shewn 
me by Coll. Dyer, and they have made a large Collection of Ma 
terials for making more. 

Mr. Wisner l of New York, informs me that his son has made a 
Quantity of very good, by the Method published by the Continen 
tal Congress. 

Two persons belonging to York Town in this Colony have made 
one hundred and twenty Weight, have reed, the Premium and are 
making more. 

A Gentleman in Maryland made some last June from Tobacco 
House Earth. 

Mr. Randolph, 2 our venerable President, affirms to me that, 
every Planter almost in that Colony, has made it from Tobacco 
House Earth. That the Process is so simple that a Child can 
make it. It consists in nothing but making a Lixivium from the 
Earth which is impregnated with it, and then evaporating the 
Lixivium. That there is certainly discovered in Virginia a vast 
Quantity of the Rocks of Salt Petre. That there are salt Petre 
Rocks he says all Chemists and Naturalists who have written 
Agree, and that he was informed by many Gentlemen in Virginia, 
cautious, incredulous Men, of strict Honour and Veracity, that

they have been to see the Rocks and tryed them and found them 
by Experiment to be the very Rock of salt Petre. 

The old Gentn. in short, who is not credulous nor inthusiastical 
but very steady, solid, and grave, is as sanguine and confident as 
you can conceive, that it is the Easiest Thing in the World to make 
it, and that the Tobacco Colonies alone are sufficient to supply the 
Continent forever. 

Every Colony, My Friend, must set up Works at the public 
Expence. 

I am determined never to have Salt Petre out of my Mind, but 
to insert some stroke or other about it in every Letter for the 
future. It must be had.

prospect of keeping any Trade alive, and what?

DEAR SIR, When it is said that it is the Prerogative of om 
niscience to Search Hearts, I suppose it is meant that no human 
Sagacity can penetrate at all Times into Mens Bosoms and dis 
cover with precise Certainty the secrets there; and in this Sense 
it is certainly true. 

But there is a sense in which Men may be said to be possessed 
of a Faculty of Searching Hearts too. There is a Discernment com 
petent to Mortals by which they can penetrate into the Minds of 
Men and discover their Secret Passions, Prejudices, Habits, Hopes, 
Fears, W T ishes and Designs, and by this Means judge what Part 
they will act in given Circumstances for the future and see what 
Principles and Motives have actuated them to the Conduct they 
have held in certain Conjunctures of Circumstances which are 
passed. 

A Dexterity and Facility of thus unravelling Mens Thoughts 
and a Faculty of governing them by Means of the Knowledge we 
have of them, constitutes the principal Part of the Art of a 
Politician. 

In a Provincial Assembly, where we know a Man s Pedigree and 



1775] Warren-Adams Letters 161 

Biography, his Education, Profession and Connections, as well as 
his Fortune, it is easy to see what it is that governs a Man and de 
termines him to this Party in Preference to that, to this System 
of Politicks rather than another, etc. 

But here it is quite otherwise. We frequently see Phenomena 
which puzzle us. 

It requires Time to enquire and learn the Characters and Con 
nections, the Interests and Views of a Multitude of Strangers. 

It would be an exquisite Amusement, an high Gratification of 
Curiosity, this same Mystery of Politicks if the Magnitude of the 
Interests and Consequences did not interest us Some times too 
much.

DEAR SIR, I have only Time to acquaint you that Yesterday, 
that eminent American, and most worthy Man The Honourable 
Peytoun Randolph, Esqr., our first venerable President, departed 
this Life in an Apoplectic Fit. He was seized at Table, having 
but a few Moments before set down with a good deal of Company 
to dinner. He died in the Evening, without ever recovering his 
senses after the first Stroke. 

As this Gentleman Sustained very deservedly One of the first 
American Characters, as he was the first President of the united 
Colonies, and as he was universally esteemed for his great Virtues 
and shining Abilities, the Congress have determined to shew his 
Memory and Remains all possible Demonstrations of Respect. 
The whole Body is to attend the Funeral in as much Mourning as 
our Laws will admit. The Funeral is to be tomorrow. I am the 
more pleased with this Respect on Account of an Impropriety, 
which you know was unfelt. 1 

This venerable Sage, I assure you, since he has stood upon the 
same Floor with the rest of Us has rose in the Esteem of all. He 
was attentive, judicious and his Knowledge Eloquence, and clas-

sical Correctness shewed Us the able and experienced Statesman

concealed these and shewed Us chiefly the upright and impartial 
Moderator of Debate. 

You would have wondered more at the Want of [sensijbility 
which you remarked if you had been here and seen, the Difference. 

Mr. Randolph was as firm, stable and consistent a Patriot as 
any here. The Loss must be very great to Virginia in Particular 
and the Continent in general I sometimes wonder that a sim

SIR, The Congress has resolved, 3 that a just Account of the 
Hostilities committed by the ministerial Army and Navy, in 
America, since the month of March last, be collected, with proper 
Evidence of the Facts; the Number and Value of the Buildings 
destroyed, the Vessells whether inward or outward bound, seized 
or captivated and the Stock of all kinds, plundered, in any Part of 
the Continent, as you will see by an authenticated Copy of the 
Resolution, here inclosed. 

It is apprehended that little need be said to shew the Utility of 
this Measure. It may be necessary for our Justification, in the 
Judgment of the People of Great Britain, and foreign Nations; 
the Information of the Colonies and the Use of History, not to 
mention any other Purpose. 

Our Distance here from the Scenes of Violence makes it neces 
sary for us to apply to several Assemblies, as well as private 
Gentlemen for Assistance; and from your Character it is presumed, 
you will chearfully yield us all the Aid in your Power.

SIR, A Method of collecting Salt Petre from the Air which is 
talked of here is this. Take of Lime and Ashes equal Quantities, 
and of horse dung a Quantity equal to both the Ashes and Lime; 
mix them together into a Mortar, with this Mortar, and a Quantity 
of long Straw to keep it together build two Walls eighteen Inches 
thick, and three feet high, about four feet asunder then make 
a Center and turn and Arch over semicircularly from the Top of 
one Wall to that of the other, and this Arch may be made Eighteen 
Inches thick too. These Walls with the Arch over them may be 
continued to any length you please. There must be a shed over it 
to keep off the Rain and the Arch must be wett every Day with 
Urine. This in summer, will collect so much salt Petre that an 
ounce may be extracted from every Pound of the Walls in three 
months. In Winter it will make as fast provided you keep a Fire 
at one End of the Arch, that the Wind may blow the Fire and 
Smoke under the Arch and keep it from freezing. 

This is one Method as it is affirmed by Gentlemen here. 

Sulphur, Nitre and Lead We must have of our own. We must 
not depend upon Navigation for these. I wish the Comtee. of the

DEAR SIR, Upon the Receipt of the Intelligence of Dr. 
[Church s] Letter, Dr. Morgan was chosen in his Room. 1 This 
Letter is intended to be sent by him, and therefore probably will 
not go in ten days. 

John Morgan a Native of this City is a Doctor of Physick, a 
Fellow of the Royal Society at London; Correspondent of the 
Royal Academy of Surgery at Paris; Member of the Arcadian 
Belles Lettres Society at Rome; Licentiate of the Royal Colledges 
of Physicians in London and in Edinburgh; and Professor of the 
Theory and Practice of Medecine in the Colledge of Philadelphia. 

This Gentleman served an Apprenticeship of six or seven years 
under Dr. John Redman, 2 an eminent Physician in this City, dur 
ing which Time he had an opportunity of Seeing the Practice of all 
the eminent Physicians in this City, as he attended at the Hos 
pital, and for one Year made up the Prescriptions of all. After 
this he devoted himself four Years to a military Life and went 
into the service as a Physician and surgeon to the Troops raised 
by this Colony. After this he went abroad, and spent five years 
in Europe, under the most celebrated Masters in every Branch of 
Medicine, and visiting the principal Cities and Seats of Science 
in Great Britain, Holland, France and Italy. This Gentleman 
in 1765, delivered a Discourse upon the Institution of Medical 
Schools in America, at a Commencement, which was published 
with a Preface, containing an Apology for attempting to introduce 
the regular Mode of practising Physic in Philadelphia. Every 
Winter since he has read Lectures to the students at the Colledge

DEAR SIR, Governor Ward of Rhode Island has a son about 
five and twenty years old who has been so far carried away in the 
Absence of his Father, with a Zeal for his Country as to inlist into 
the Artillery as a private. He never said a Word to the Governor 
about, or he would have had a Commission. A younger Brother, 3 
who solicited of his father Permission to enter the service was 
made a Captain. Now it is a Pity, that this young Gentleman s 
Patriotism, should not be encouraged and rewarded, and it is a 
greater Pity that an Elder Brother should be a private soldier in 
an Army where his younger Brother is an officer and a Captain. 
And a greater Pity still that a Governor of a Province and a 
worthy Member of the Continental Congress, and the Constant 
Chairman of our Committee of the whole House, should have a 
deserving son in the Army in the Ranks, when Multitudes of others 
in Commissions have no such Pretentions. 

I wish you would mention this Matter at Head Quarters and see

DR. SIR, Our Association against Importations and Exporta- 
tions, from and to G. Britain, Ireland and the British West Indies, 
if We consider its Influence, upon the Revenue, the Commerce, the 
Manufactures and the Agriculture of the Kingdom, is a formid 
able Shield of Defence for Us. It is Shearing of its Beams that 
Luminary, which, in all its Glory might dazzle our feeble Sight. 

But a Question arises, whether, our Association against Exporta- 
tions, can be observed, so as to have its full Effect, upon Britain, 
Ireland and the West Indies, unless We extend it further? We 
have agreed not to export to B., I. and the W. Indies. Parliament 
has made an Act that We shall not export to any other Place. So 
that Trade is entirely stopped. But will not a Smuggling Trade be 
opened? That is, will not Adventurers push out Vessells against 
the Act of Parliament? If they do, When the Vessells are once at 
Sea, will they not go to the Place where a Famine price is to be 
had? The Spirit of Commerce is mercenary and avaricious, and 
Merchants will go Where the Scarcity is greatest, the Demand 
quickest and the Price highest. 

What Security then can we have that Merchants will not order 
their Vessells to the West India Islands, British or foreign, to Ire 
land or even to Great Britain, in Defyance of our Association ? 

Besides is there not reason to apprehend that the concealed 
Tories of whom there are many in every Colony, and especially in 
every maritime Town, will send their Vessels to sea, on purpose 
to be taken by the Enemy, and sent to supply the Army and 
Navy in America? It is true, their Vessels would be forfeited, and 



T ?75] Warren* Adams Letters 167 

seized, and condemned no doubt; but they might be pleased with 
this, and would easily obtain hereafter Compensation or Retribu 
tion for this meritorious Sacrifice from the Ministry. 

In short may not our association be wholly evaded and eluded, 
if we don t draw it closer? 1 My own opinion upon these great 
Questions I may possibly give you some time or other. But I wish 
to have yours.

DR. SIR, What think you of a North American Monarchy? 
Suppose We should appoint a Continental King, and a Continental 
House 01 Lords, and a Continental House of Commons, to be an 
nually, or triennially, or septennially elected, and in this Way 
make a Supreme American Legislature? This is easily done you 
know by an omnipotent Continental Congress; and when once 
effected, His American Majesty may appoint a Governor for every 
Province, as his Brittannic Majesty used to do, and Lt. Governor 
and Secretary and judge of Admiralty. Nay, his Continental Ma 
jesty may appoint the Judges of the Supream Courts, etc., too; or 
if his American Majesty should condescend to permit the provin 
cial Legislatures, or Assemblies [may] nominate two, three or four 
Persons, out of whom he should select a Governor; and 3 or 4 Men 
for Chief Justice, etc., out of whom he should choose one, would 
not this do, nicely? 

To his Continental Majesty in his Continental Privy Council, 
Appeals might lie, from all Admiralty Cases, and from all civil 
Causes personal at least, of a certain Value. And all Disputes 
about Land, that is about Boundaries of Colonies, should be set 
tled by the Continental King and Council, as they used to be by 
the British K. and Council. What a magnificent system? 

I assure you this is no Chimsera of my own. It is whispered 
about in Coffee Houses, etc., and there are who wish it.

I am inclined to think it is done as one Artifice more to divide 
the Colonies. But in vain. It would be very curious to give you 
an History of the out-a-Door Tricks for this important End of di 
viding the Colonies. Last Fall the Quakers and Antipoedobaptists 
were conjured up to pick a Quarrell with Massachusetts; last 
Spring the Land Jobbers were stimulated to pick a Quarrell with 
Connecticutt for the same End. The Quakers and Anabaptists 
were hushed and abashed, or rather the reasonable conscientious 
Part of them were convincd in one evening. The Land Jobbers 
will meet no better success.

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
WATERTOWN, October 28, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, I did not hear till yesterday in the afternoon 
that Colonel Reed had any intention to leave us so soon, and begin 
his journey to Philadelphia on this day. The first reflection on 
this occasion was that he would be missed here. I have formed an 
excellent opinion of him as a man of sense, politeness and abilities 
for business. He has done us great service. He is, I might add, 
strongly attached to the public cause of America. But all this you 
know, and perhaps more of his character than I do. I shall there 
fore only say that I regret his leaving us, and shall wish for his 
return. The next reflection was that I must embrace the opportu 
nity to write to you. For that purpose I assigned the evening, but 
unluckily the House set till eight o clock and prevented me. 
Church had a hearing before us yesterday, which took us nearly 
the whole day. 1 After he withdrew there was a motion for a sus 
pension of any judgment upon him, least it might influence his 
court or jury upon his trial. Another motion that we should 
accept a resignation he had made by letter, and accompany it 
with a resolve that we should save our honour, and not injure him 
in the trial. The end of the whole matter was appointing a com 
mittee to report how to proceed. I have now only time to thank 
you for your kind letters by Mr. Tracy, which I received a few days 

I Church s account of this examination is in I Mass, Hist. Collections, i. 84.

ago, and those by Captain Macpherson, which came to hand yes 
terday. You have obliged me extreamly; they have edified, com 
forted, strengthened and encouraged. I feel like a new man. I 
have not seen the bearer of the last; shall try to see him this after 
noon. We have no kind of news. Time won t permit me to say 
anything on the important subject of your letters, but to compen 
sate you for any observations of mine I shall inclose what I guess 
wiUbe much more agreeable. The author has stole an hour now and 
then since we came to town to proceed so far as you ll see, on pur 
pose to unbend your mind a little, by amusements of a poetical 
kind well knowing you have a taste for them. You have the two 
acts in print, you wrote for last summer, and two subsequent ones 
and the Epilogue. The whole are at your disposition. . . . l 

I forgot to tell you that the powder arrived in our vessel at the 
eastward has got from ninety tons by various gradations to seven 
and one half, which I think I gave you as the true account, being 
what I thought I could rely on; and from thence to fifteen hundred 
and from thence to six hundred, which I believe is the true one, 
tho I can t say that it won t descend to three Ibs. 

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADA., Novr. 4th, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, I thank you heartily for your very acceptable 
Letter of the 23 of October by Fessenden. It is very afflicting to 
hear the universal Complaint of the Want of that most necessary 
Article, Gunpowder, and especially in the Camp before Boston. 
I hope however that this Want will soon be supplied, and God 
grant that a good Use may be made of it. The Congress yesterday 
was presented with the Colors of the seventh Regiment taken in 
Fort Chamblee, which is surrendered to Major Brown. The Ac 
quisition of 1 24 Barrils of Powder gives a happy Turn to our Affairs 
in that Quarter the Success of which I almost began to despair of. 

The Gentlemen who have lately returned 2 from the Camp may, 
perhaps all of them entertain a favorable Opinion of our Colony 
I may possibly be partial in saying, not more favorable than it de- 

I The Group. 2 Their report was laid before Congress, November I. 



170 Warren-Adams Letters [1775 

serves. Be that as it may, the Congress have judgd it necessary 
to continue the Establishment of the Men s pay, and to enlarge 
that of the Captains and Lieutenants. In Addition to the Conti 
nental Army four new Batallions are to be raised, viz, three for 
the Defence of South Carolina and one for Georgia. 1 These with 
looo Men before orderd for North Carolina, with the Assistance 
of provincial Forces, it is hoped will be sufficient to defend the 
three Southernmost Colonies. 

It is recommended to N. Hampshire to form a Government to 
their own liking, during this Contest; 2 and S. Carolina 3 is allowd 
to do the same if they judge it necessary. I believe the Time is 
near when the most timid will see the absolute Necessity of every 
one of the Colonies setting up a Government within itself. 

No Provisions or Produce is to be exported from any of the 
united Colonies to any part of the World till the first of March 
except for the Importation of the Unum Necessarium, and for 
Supplys from one Colony to another, under the Direction of Com 
mittees, and a further Exception of live Stock. Under the last 
Head, and Horses are allowd to be sent to the foreign West Indies. 
We shall by the Spring know the full Effect of our Non-exporta 
tion Agreement in the West Indies. Perhaps Alliances may then 
be formed with foreign Powers, and Trade opened to all the World 
Great Britain excepted. 

You will possibly think I have set myself down to furnish a few 
Paragraphs for Edes and Gills paper, and what is more that I am 
betraying the Secrets of Congress. I confess I am giving my 
Friend as much Information as I dare, of things which are of such 
a Nature as that they cannot long be kept secret, and therefore 
I suppose it never was intended they should be. I mention them 
however in Confidence that you will not publish them. I wish I 
was at Liberty to tell you many of the Transactions of our body, 
but I am restraind by the Ties of Honor; and though it is painful 
to me, you know, to keep Secrets, I will not violate my Honor to 
relieve myself or gratify my Friend. [Nine lines are here erased, 
apparently after the receipt of the letter.] But why have I told you

so trifling a Story, for which I cannot forgive my self till I have 
askd forgiveness of you. We live in a most important Age, which 
demands that every Moment should be improvd to some serious 
Purpose. It is the Age of George the Third; and to do Justice to 
our most gracious King, I will affirm it as my Opinion, that his 
Councils and Administration will necessarily produce the grandest 
Revolutions the World has ever yet seen. The Wheels of Provi 
dence seem to be in their swiftest Motion. Events succeed each 
other so rapidly that the most industrious and able Politicians 
can scarcely improve them to the full purposes for which they 
seem to be designd. 

You must send your best Men here; therefore recall me from 
this Service. Men of moderate Abilities, especially when weak- 
end by Age are not fit to be employed in founding Empires. 

Let me talk with you a little about the Affairs of our own Col 
ony. I persuade my self, my dear friend, that the greatest Care and 
Circumspection will be used to conduct its internal Police with 
Wisdom and Integrity. The Eyes of Mankind will be upon you, 
to see whether the Government, which is now more popular than 
it has been for many years past, will be productive of more Virtue 
moral and political. We may look up to Armies for our Defence, 
but Virtue is our best Security. It is not possible that any State 
should long continue free, where Virtue is not supremely honord. 
This is as seasonably as it is justly said by one of the most cele 
brated Writers of the present time. Perhaps the Form of Govern 
ment now adopted may be permanent; Should it be only temporary, 
the golden Opportunity of recovering the Virtue and reforming the 
Manners of our Country should be industriously improvd. 

Our Ancestors laid an excellent Foundation for the Security of 
Liberty, by setting up in a few years after their Arrival, a publick 
Seminary of Learning; and by their Laws, they obligd every Town 
consisting of a certain Number of Families to keep and maintain 
a Grammar School. I should be much grievd if it should be true as 
I am informd, that some of our Towns have dismissd their School 
masters, alledging that the extraordinary Expence of defending 
the Country renders them unable to support them. I hope this In 
attention to the Principles of our wise forefathers does not prevail. 



172 Warren- Adams Letters [1775 

If there should be any Danger of it, would not the leading Gentle 
men do eminent Service to the Publick, by impressing upon the 
Minds of the People, the Necessity and Importance of encour 
aging that System of Education, which in my opinion, is so well 
calculated to diffuse among the Individuals of the Community, 
the Principles of Morality, so essentially necessary for the Preser 
vation of publick Liberty. There are Virtues and Vices which are 
properly called political. "Corruption, Dishonesty to one s Coun 
try, Luxury and Extravagance tend to the Ruin of States." The 
opposite Virtues tend to their Establishment. But "there is a 
Connection between Vices as well as Virtues, and one opens the 
Door for the Entrance of another." Therefore "Every able Poli 
tician will guard against other Vices" and be attentive to promote 
every Virtue. He who is void of Virtuous Attachment in private 
Life, is, or very soon will be void of all Regard to his Country. 
There is seldom an Instance of a Man guilty of betraying his 
Country, who had not before lost the feeling of moral Obligation 
in his private Connections. Before C[hurc]h was detected of 
holding a criminal Correspondence with the Enemies of his Coun 
try, his Infidelity to his Wife had been notorious. Since private 
and publick Vices, though not always apparently, are in Reality 
so nearly connected, of how much Importance, how necessary is it, 
that the utmost pains be taken by the Publick, to have the Prin 
ciples of Virtue early inculcated on the Minds even of Children, 
and the moral Sense universally kept alive, and that the wise 
Institutions of our -Ancestors for those great Purposes be encour- 
agd by the Government. For no People will tamely surrender 
their Liberties, nor can they easily be subdued, where Knowledge 
is diffusd and Virtue preservd. On the Contrary, when People are 
universally ignorant and debauched in their Manners, they will 
sink under their own Weight, without the Aid of foreign Invaders. 
There are other things which, I humbly conceive, require the 
most serious Consideration of the Legislative. We have heretofore 
complaind, and I think justly, that bad Men have too often found 
their Way into places of publick Trust. "Nothing is more essen 
tial to the Establishment of Manners in a State, than that all 
Persons employd in Places of Power and Trust be Men of exem- 



Warren-Adams Letters 173 

plary Characters. The Publick cannot be too curious concerning 
the Characters of Publick Men." We have also complaind, that 
a Plurality of Places incompatible with each other have some 
times been vested in one Person. If under the former Administra 
tion there was no Danger to be apprehended from vesting the 
different Powers of Government in the same Persons, why did the 
Patriots so loudly protest against it? If Danger is always to be 
apprehended from it, should we not by continuing the Practice, 
too much imitate the degenerate Romans, who upon the Fall of 
Julius set up Augustus? They changd indeed their Masters, and 
when they had destroyd the Tyrant sufferd the Tyranny to con 
tinue. Tell me how a Judge of Probate can consistently sit at the 
Council Board and joyn in a Decision there upon an appeal from 
his own Judgment? Perhaps, being personally interested in an 
other Appointment, I may view it with a partial Eye. But you 
may well remember that the Secretary of the Colony declind tak 
ing a Seat at the Council Board, to which he had been elected 
prior to his Appointment, until, in the House of Representatives 
he had publickly requested their opinion of the Propriety of it, and 
there heard it explicitly declared by an eminent and truly patriot- 
ick Member as his Opinion, that as the Place was not then as it 
formerly had been, the Gift of the Crown but of the People, there 
was no Impropriety in his holding it. The rest of the Members 
were silent. Major H[awle]y has as much of the stern Virtue and 
Spirit of a Roman Censor as any Gentleman I ever conversd 
with. 1 The Appointment of the Secretary and his Election to a 
Seat at the Board were both made in the Time of his Absence 
from the Colony and without the Solicitation of any of his Friends 
that he knew of most assuredly without his own. 2 As he is re- 
solvd never wittingly to disgrace himself or his Country, he still 
employs his Mind on the Subject, and wishes for your candid and 
impartial Sentiments. 

I fear I have trespassd on your Leisure, and conclude, with 
assuring you that I am with sincere Regards to Mrs. Warren, 
your very affectionate Friend

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

Novr. 5, 1775 

DEAR SIR, The Committee have returned, and I think well 
pleased with their Reception as well as with what they saw and 
heard. Impressions, have been made upon them either by the 
New England Gentlemen, or at Head Quarters, much to the Ad 
vantage of our Cause, I assure you. Their Return has contributed 
much to Harmony and Unanimity, in all smaller Matters, in the 
great material Questions there was enough of them before. 

I am under great obligations to you for your Attentions to me. 
Shall answer your Letters as soon as Time will admit, but I assure 
you I am very busy. I am obliged to trouble you with Enquiries 
concerning Subjects which you understand very well and I know 
nothing of. 

I want to know what is become of the Whalemen, Codfishers, 
and other Seamen belonging to our Province, and what Number 
of them you imagine might be inlisted into the service of the Con 
tinent, or of the Province, or of private Adventurers in Case a 
Taste for Privateering and a maritime Warfare should prevail, 
whether you think that two or three Battalions of Marines could 
be easily inlisted in our Province. 

What Ships, Brigantines, Schooners, suitable for armed Vessells 
might be purchased or hired, and at what Prices in our Province, 
what their Burthen, Depth of Water, Length of Keel, Breadth, 
hight between Decks, Age, etc., and to whom they belong? 

What Places are most suitable, that is safest and best accommo 
dated, for building new Vessells, if any should be wanted; and what 
shipwrights may be had, and in what Time Vessells compleated? 



i?75] Warren-Adams Letters 175 

But above all, what Persons, their Names, Ages, Places of 
Abode and Characters, may be found in our Province who might 
be qualified to serve as Commanders and Officers, etc. 

These are necessary Enquiries, and I am very ill qualified to 
make them, yet to tell you a secret in Confidence, it has become 
my Duty. There is a Disposition prevailing to spare no Pains or 
Expence, in the necessary Defence of our Rights by sea or Land. 

The News you will see in the Papers, give you Joy of the good 
Prospect to the Northward. 

New Hampshire has Permission to establish what Form of 
Government they like best, and so has S. Carolina and so will 
every other Colony which shall ask for it which they all will do 
soon, if the Squabble continues. 

New England will now be able to exert her Strength and if I 
ken it right, it will be found to be that of a full grown Man, no 
Infant. 

Who expected to live to see the Principles of Liberty Spread 
and prevail so rapidly, human Nature exerting her whole Rights, 
unshackled by Priests or Kings or Nobles, pulling down Tyrannies 
like Sampson, and building up, what Governments the People 
think best framed for human Felicity. 

God grant the Spirit, success. 

My best Respects to your good Lady, will write her as soon as 
possible.

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
WATERTOWN, November 5, 1775 

The prices of European and West India goods are, notwithstand 
ing our resolves, much advanced. Trade will have its course. 
Goods will rise and fall in proportion to the demand for them, and 
the quantity at market, etc., in spite of laws, honor, patriotism, 
or any other principle. The people however seem to have forgot 
their expectations, and the injunctions laid on the merchant, and 
little is said about it. 



176 W arren- Adams Letters [1775 

The non-exportation is sacredly observed, and I believe [has] 
never been violated in a single instance; and such is the spirit here, 
that it cannot be violated with any degree of safety. Provisions 
are plenty and cheap, beef is a drug, and our people complain much 
that the Commissary sends to Connecticut for all his beef. I think 
it but fair that he should give this Colony a chance in that article 
at least, especially as we are to supply the army with hay and 
wood, which our people say they can t do and keep their cattle 
now fat over the winter. This has occasioned great difficulty here. 
The General has offered 5/ per [cwt] for hay, and 20 / per cord for 
wood, and cannot be supplied. This he imputes to a monopolizing, 
avaritious spirit, and perhaps not wholly without foundations. 1 
The prices are indeed high, but the people have much to say, and 
among other things ask why that spirit should be confined to 
those articles, and why cyder is to be had at 4/ per barrel. In the 
meantime the army has suffered much for want of wood, and the 
officers have not been able to restrain them from cutting down the 
fine groves of Cambridge and threatning to pull down houses for 
fuel. The General has made repeated applications to us. We at 
last set ourselves seriously to remedy the evil, which perhaps 
might terminate in breaking up the army. We spent the whole of 
last Fryday and evening on the subject. We at last chose a com 
mittee 2 in aid to the Quartermaster general to purchase those 
articles and impowered them to enter the wood lots of the Refugees, 
cut, stack, and procure teams to carry to the camp wood as fast as 
possible, and hay as soon as they can get it. The teams are passing 
all day, and I hope this step will be a radical cure. 

Your next question is with regard to trade, a subject compli 
cated, vast and unsounded. When I consider the great abundance 
we have of the necessaries and conveniences of life, that we want 
nothing but salt petre and I hope we are in a way to get that, I 
could wish a total stop was put to all trade. But when I consider 
the temper and genius of the people, the long habits they have 
been used to, I fear it would produce uneasiness and bad conse-

quences. I believe therefore you will find it necessary to indulge so 
much as will not endanger the success of your commercial meas 
ures. If the merchant will run the hazard, so much may tend to 
conciliate the affections of other nations, and unite them with us 
on principles of interest, the strongest of all principles in these 
degenerate days. I am sensible many important questions may 
arise on this head, too many and too important for my abilities, 
or opportunities to discuss at present. I am extreamly pleased 
with the appointment of the committee you mention, and with the 
committee itself. I believe this business will produce great conse 
quences. You may be assured I shall exert myself to have your 
expectations and wishes complied with, both with regard to time 
and manner. 

Macpherson is yet here, but I dare not ask questions. Nothing 
transpires, and whether any plan is adopted or not can t inform 
you. We have no news here; all things remain in statu quo. The 
enemy, I mean their army, are quiet, and we watch them. Bar 
racks are building for our troops, and many of them are ready to 
receive them. The whole will be compleated in the course of this 
month; and indeed it is time; the season is rainy and cold. The 
pirates continue to rove about and threaten our seaports. They 
made an attempt to go into Plymouth, but were discouraged by 
the appearance of the harbour, returned and reported to the 
Admiral that it was not fit to receive King s ships. Our people are, 
however, preparing for them, if they alter their minds. Our 
Assembly have established salt petre works at Newburyport, 
under the direction of a committee, Doctor Whiting, John Peck, 
Deacon Baker and one Phips, 1 the last of whom is said to be an 
adept that way, and have given a bounty of \l per pound to any 
man that shall make fifty pounds or upwards, this bounty to con 
tinue to next June. We have also taken care to encourage the man 
ufacture of fire arms. Thus far we have done well, but our militia 
is still in a miserable unsettled situation. This principally or wholly 
arises from a dispute between the two Houses. We claim an equal 
right with them in the appointment of the field officers. This claim

we ground on your resolutions, which will bear very fairly that 
construction, and is certainly the most eligible constitution, and 
say that if that is not the true construction we, that deserve as 
large privileges as any people, are not on an equal footing with the 
other Colonies. The Board contend for the exclusive right, plead 
the Charter, and assert the prerogative with as much zeal, pride 
and hauteur of dominion as if the powers of monarchy were vested 
in them and their heirs, by a divine, indefeasible right. This is 
indeed curious, to see a Council of this Province contending for 
the dirty part of the Constitution, the prerogative of the Governor. 
How it is to end, or when, I know not. 1 I wish they had in the 
exercise of powers we don t dispute with them, made appoint 
ments in some instances less exceptionable than they have. You 
will hardly expect to hear after what I last wrote you that Paine 
is appointed a judge, but so it is. At a time when I least expected, 
he was appointed, it is said, by the influence of Hawley. Spooner, 
Foster, and I believe Palmer, were the principle conductors. The 
rank is thus, John Adams, Esqr. Chief Justice, Cushing, Read, 
Paine, Sargeant. 2 Now we shall see if he will act in an inferiour 
station to his superiour. The people at the eastward are apprehen 
sive the enemy intend to possess themselves of an advantageous 
post at Falmouth, and hold that place and secure the harbour. . . . 

Doctor Church is expelled by almost an unanimous vote. 

Favourable accounts from the western army; doubtless you have 
the whole.

the Congress? How long are we to wait for the success of the peti

one of the Board, I aimed at giving you the same light he gave me. He assured me their

to their power; but from a conviction that they were obliged to act as they did in order to 
conform to the fundamental resolve of the Congress on which this Government was set up;

November 7. ... We shall rise, perhaps tomorrow or next day. 1 
We have some thoughts of coming to a new choice of delegates this

luxury can wish. I congratulate you on the success at Chamblee.

to make this demand upon you, but I know it must be usefully 
imployd and I am fearful if I do not question you I shall loose some 
improvement which I might otherways make. 

What becomes of the State prisoner? * is he not to have a trial? 
When weighd in the balance I fear he will be found wanting. A 
patriot without religion in my estimation is as great a paradox as 
an honest Man without the fear of God. Is it possible that he 
whom no moral obligations bind can have any real Good Will 
towards Man, can he be a patriot who by an openly vicious con 
duct is undermineing the very bonds of Society, corrupting the 
Morals of Youth and by his bad example injuring that very Coun 
try he professes to patronize more than he can possibly compen 
sate by his intrepidity, Generosity and honour? The Scriptures 
tell us righteousness exalteth a Nation. 

I wish there was more of it to be seen among all orders and pro 
fessions, but the Continental Connexion will not improve the 
Morals of our Youth. A little less swearing at our New England 
puritanism would be full as honorary to our Southern Brethren. 
I thank you my Friend for your invitation but cannot comply 
with it tho my inclination is very strong. I want to see my 
Friends and hear our worthy Dr. Pray be so kind as to present 
my regards to Dr Winthrop and Lady. She desired me to write 
to her. I wish my Friend would let her know that I can better 
reply to a favour from her than begin a correspondence, tho I 
should esteem it an honour. But Marcia can witness for me how 
averse I have been to writing. 

I lament the Death of the Worthy president as of an honest 

I Church. On November II the House adopted the following report and resolution: 
"Whereas it appears to this House, that Dr. Benjamin Church, late a Member thereof, 
by his past Conduct has discovered himself to be Inimical to the United American Colonies, 
and has laid himself open in their Opinion to a Criminal Prosecution for his past Conduct, 
in holding a traiterous Correspondence with our Enemies: And whereas the Court-Martial 
in whose Custody he now is from the Want of a suitable Provision in the Continental 
Articles of War, may be unable to bring the said Church to condign Punishment; and the 
setting him at Liberty may be attended with dangerous Consequences to the Cause of 
America: therefore, 

" Resolved, That the honorable the Council of this Colony be, and they hereby are desired 
to take suitable Measures for causing the said Benjamin Church, in Case of his being lib 
erated from his present Confinement, to be apprehended and secured, and that such further 
Measures with respect to him may be pursued as the Security of this People loudly De 
mands, and the Laws of this Colony will justify."

well might some folks have saved their credit and their Bacon too

O Ambition, how many inconsistent actions dost thou make

Adieu, my Friend. I hope soon to have the pleasure of seeing

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 

WATERTOWN, November 14, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, I last evening received yours by Captain Gist, 
and this morning by Fessenden. It gives me great pleasure to see 
things in such a fine way, and you in such choice spirits. I con 
gratulate you on the taking of St. John s. This news Fessenden 
brings with him from Hartford. This gives us great spirits. He 
says likewise that Arnold was within twelve miles of Quebec. 
You must know that our anxiety for him and his party has been 
great. Last night I was at Head quarters, where accounts were 
received that one Colonel Enos 2 of Connecticut, with three com 
panies he commanded as a rear guard, had come off and left him, 
while advanced thirty miles ahead, and perhaps at Chaudiere 
Pond. This officer certainly deserves hanging. It will always give 
me great pleasure to be able to give you any information. Great 
numbers of the Whalemen are gone on voyages which we permit 
ted, after having taken bonds for the landing their oil and bone in 
some port here other than Boston and Nantucket, some of them 
are in the army, and sea coast service^jiajiy of them, and the 
greater part of our fishermen and seame^^kprne and in no serv- 

1 Probably a hit at Hancock. 

2 Roger Enos (1729-1808). He was court-martialed, but acquitted "with honor," and 
retired from the army. He later accepted a commission of brigadier general in the Ver 
mont militia.

ice, earnestly wishing to be employed in the privateering business. 
What numbers might be inlisted on that service I can t readily 
compute, but I have no difficulty in supposing that at least three 
battalions might be raised in this Colony. The taste for it runs 
high here. As to ships and other vessels, I believe there are great 
numbers very suitable to arm already on hand. Almost every port 
of any consequence could furnish more or less, either great or 
small. Perhaps ships might be difficult to find that could mount 
twenty guns or upwards; but vessels to carry from six to sixteen 
guns I think we abound in, and I think they would soon furnish 
us with others. These vessels are of all burthens, drafts of water, 
and dimensions, and are many of them excellent sailors, and may 
be either purchased, or hired, on very reasonable terms. I think 
the General gives only 5/4 per ton per month. I am not acquainted 
at Haverhill, Newberry, etc., but from what I have heard, vessels 
might be built there, safe and with great despatch; and perhaps 
at Kennebeck and North River, etc., etc. We have no want of the 
best shipwrights. As to the time for compleating them, much will 
depend on the winter; but they may be ready as soon as wanted 
in the Spring, if immediately engaged in. As for your next ques 
tion, the names, etc., of those fit to command, I am not quite so 
ready to answer. You know we have not practised privateering 
so much here as they have in some of the other colonies, and it is- a 
business I never was concerned in; but I have no doubt that 
many fine fellows can be found, who have been masters of vessels 
and at some time in their lives served on board men of war and 
privateers. I have one Captain Samson 1 in my employ, who has 
served in both, and particularly with Captain Macpherson the 
last war. Him I would venture a vessel with. There is Souter, 2 
who you know. Time won t permit me to recollect many others, 
but from the nature and circumstances of this Colony, there must 
be many. I will endeavour to recollect some for my next. I am glad 
to see the policy of C^^ress turned this way, and to see you en 
gaged. You must k^^V think you qualified for any thing you 
will undertake.^ I congratulate South Carolina and New Hamp-

shire on the indulgence shewn them by the Congress. I hope they 
will improve it to the best advantage. I wish for the time when we 
shall all have the same liberty. Our situation must be more irk 
some than ever. To be surrounded on all sides with governments 
founded on proper principles, and constituted to promote the free 
and equal liberty and happiness of mankind, while we are plagued 
with a constitution where the prerogative of the crown and the 
liberty of the subject are eternally militating, and in the very for 
mation of which the last is but a secondary consideration to the 
first. Indeed, my friend, I am sick of our constitution, more so 
than ever. [I] have seen enough lately to make me so. I hate the 
name of our charter, which fascinates and shackles us. I hate the 
monarchical part of our government, and certainly you would 
more than ever, if you knew our present monarchs. But many of 
them you have no idea of; they are totally changed since you left 
us, divers of them I mean. They have got a whirl in their brains, 
imagine themselves kings, and have assumed every air and pomp 
of royalty but the crown and scepter. You might search Prince- 
town, Brookline, Wrentham, Braintree and several other towns, 
without finding a man you could possibly know, or suppose to have 
been chose a councillor here by the freemen of this Colony, no 
longer ago than last July, and for no longer a time than next May. 
I shall not trouble you with any further and more particular ac 
count than I have already given, of a dispute the last session be 
tween the two Houses, much to our disadvantage and disgrace, 
having seen a copy of a letter from Gerry to you by Revere, when 
the matter seemed to be fully taken up. The Court was adjourned 
last Saturday to the 29th instant, after having extended your com 
mission for one month, to the last of January. We were not ready 
to come to a choice, and was afraid to postpone to the first of the 
next sitting, so near the expiration of the time. I shall be utterly 
at a loss, for three men do advise me. 

November 1 5th. I expected to have had the roar of cannon this 
morning, and some news from the army^j^ have given you. Our 
army were prepared to intrench on Cobble Hill and on Lechmore s 
Point last night. I suppose the weather has prevented. I hear 
nothing of it this stormy morning. What numbers of new recruits 



184 IVarren- Adams Letters [1775 

are arrived, we can t learn. It is generally thought not many of 
them. Though there has been appearances of fleets in the Bay. I 
wish this storm may put some of the transports upon the rocks and 
quicksands. 

You will learn by Revere the general state of things here, the 
movements and success of our land and naval force, particularly 
an account of the several prizes made. A number of letters and 
the King s proclamation, taken in one of them, will give you a 
general view of their whole system with regard to America. I 
think your Congress can be no longer in any doubts and hesitancy 
about taking capital and effectual strokes. We shall certainly 
expect it. It is said that the delicacy of modern civilization will 
not admit of foreign powers, while you continue to acknowledge a 
dependency on Britain or Britain s King, having any connection 
with you. Let us so far accomodate ourselves to their small policy 
as to remove this obstacle. I want to see trade (if we must have it) 
open, and a fleet here to protect it in opposition to Britain. Is the 
ancient policy of France so lost or dwindled that they will lose the 
golden opportunity. We must have a test, that shall distinguish 
Whigs from Tories, etc., etc. I have a thousand things to say to 
you; I want to see you. I want you there, and I want you here. 
What shall I do without you and my friend Adams at Congress? 
And yet you are both wanted here. I believe you must stay there; 
I mean, belong to that body once more. . . . She [Mrs. Warren] 
sits at the table with me, will have a paragraph of her own- says 
you "should no longer piddle at the threshold. It is time to leap 
into the theatre, to unlock the bars, and open every gate that im 
pedes the rise and growth of the American republic, and then let 
the giddy potentate send forth his puerile proclamations to France, 
to Spain and all the commercial world who may be united in build 
ing up an Empire which he can t prevent." 

At leisure then may G[eor]ge his reign review, 

And bid to empire and to crown adieu.

... I admire the character you give Doctor Morgan. I think it 
will do honour to the station he is to fill. You need not fear proper 
regard will be paid to him. I love to see characters drawn by your 
pencil; the more dozens you give me the more agreeable. I have a 
great respect for Governor Ward and his family. I will agreeable 
to your desire mention his son at Head quarters tomorrow. The 
method of making salt petre you mention, if to be depended on, is 
simple and easy in the moderate seasons. I could wish to hear 
more of it, and also of the rocks. I am not of the committee for 
sulphur, etc. I will look them up, and urge them to forward their 
discoveries to you. I believe Obrian is commissioned, and Carghill 
in a sort commissioned. There will be no difficulty in having them 
in the service of the Continent; the General may easily execute his 
order. I am very sensible of the mercenary avaritious spirit of 
merchants. They must be watched. We oblige all to give bonds, but 
how to guard against throwing themselves in the way to be taken 
has puzzled us. But such is the spirit here for preserving inviolate 
the Association, that a man must have indisputable evidence that 
his being taken was unavoidable, or never shew his head again. 
Upon this I at present rely. However, very few vessels except 
whalemen are gone, and very few have any intentions to go, unless 
to the southern colonies; and their characters must be so well 
established as to obtain certificates from our committees, who are 
not yet corrupted. I apprehend more danger from other places. 
I think the Association can t be too close drawn. We had better 
have no trade than suffer inconveniences from the interested 
tricks of Tories, or even merchants, who pretend to be well prin 
cipled, and yet are governed by interest alone. I believe you have 
a curious set of politicians in your Coffee-House. The system you 
mention is an instance of it; a magnificent one, indeed too much 
so for you and I, who I dare say will ever be content to be excused 
from the two most superb branches, the first more especially. 
I hope the tricks of these people will never answer their purposes. 
The Union is every thing. With it we shall do every thing, without 
it nothing. . . . 

November i6th. No news this morning. I think all things on 
our side look well and pleasing. I can t however but feel a little 



1 86 Warren-didams Letters [1775 

uneasy, till our army has got settled on the new plan. The General 
has many difficulties with officers and soldiers. His judgment and 
firmness I hope will carry him through them. He is certainly the 
best man for the place he is in, important as it is, that ever lived. 
One source of uneasiness is that they are not paid four weeks to a 
month. There are some grounds for it. I believe they inlisted here 
in expectation of it, as it has been at all times the invariable cus 
tom in our armies and garrisons. I could wish the Congress had 
settled it so. Where are the articles of confederation? I want to 
see some settled constitution of Congress. . . . 

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, Deer. 3, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, I have only Time to acquaint you that Con 
gress have ordered the Arrears of Pay to be discharged to the sol 
diers and one Months Advance Pay to be made. 1 No Bounty 
nor any Allowance for Lunar Months. I have a Thousand Things 
to say but no Time. Our Army must be reconciled to these 
Terms, or We shall be ruined for what I know. The Expences 
accumulating upon the Continent are so vast and boundless that 
We shall be bankrupt if not frugal. 

I lately had an opportunity, suddenly, of mentioning two very 
deserving officers, Thomas Crafts, Junior, who now lives at 
Leominster, and George Trot, who lives at Braintree, to be, the 
first a Lt. Coll, the second a Major of the Regiment of Artillery 
under Coll. Knox. These are young Men under forty, excellent 
officers, very modest, civil, sensible, and of prodigious Merit as 
well as Suffering in the American Cause. If they are neglected I 
shall be very mad, and kick and bounce like fury. Congress have 
ordered their Names to be sent to the General, and if he thinks 
they can be promoted without giving Disgust and making Un 
easiness in the Regiment, to give them Commissions. 2 

Gen. Washington knows neither of them; they have too much 
Merit and Modesty to thrust themselves forward and solicit, as 
has been the Manner of too many. But they are excellent officers, 

I journals oj the Continental Congress, in. 394. 2 Ib., in. 399. 



^775] Warren- Adams Letters 187 

and have done great Things, both in the political and military 
Way. In short vast Injustice will be done if they are not provided 
for. 1 Several Captains in the Artillery Regiment were privates 
under these officers in Paddock s Company. Captain Crafts 2 who 
is I believe the first Captain, is a younger Brother to Thomas. I 
believe that Burbeck 3 Mason, 4 Foster, 5 etc. would have no objec 
tion. 

The Merit of these Men from the Year 1764 to this day, has 
been very great tho not known to everybody. My Conscience tells 
me they ought to be promoted. They have more Merit between 
you and me than half the Generals in the Army.

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
WATERTOWN, December 3, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, I returned from Plymouth last Wednesday, 
after an absence of about ten days. . . . Doctor Morgan, who with 
his lady had lodged in my chamber the night before, had left a 
packet containing letters, etc., to your friends, which I have taken 
proper care of. This gentleman I have not yet seen. He was at 
tended next day by the surgeons of the army, and escorted to 
Head quarters in state. I propose to see him tomorrow, and shall 
look on him with all the reverence due to so exalted a character 
as you give him. Revere returned here on Fryday. No letters by 
him from you or my other friend at Congress. I have run over 
my sins of omission and commission, to see if they were unpardon 
able, and at last presumed to account for it from the nature and 
magnitude of the business you are engaged in, and the constant 
application it requires. 

I congratulate you on the success of our northern army. We 
have no late accounts from Arnold, but have sanguine expecta 
tions that before this the whole Province of Canada is reduced.

1 88 Warren- Adams Letters [1775 

You will no doubt have heard before this reaches you that a 
Lieutenant Colonel 1 and a considerable number of men had come 
off from Arnold s detachment and returned here. 

Our army here have taken possession of and fortified Cobble 
Hill, which the enemy seem to view without any emotion, not hav 
ing fired a gun. It is said they confidently rely on our army s dis 
persing when the terms of their inlistment ends, and leaving the 
lines defenceless, and an easy conquest to them. Howe I believe 
has received such intelligence and assurances from one Benja. 
Marston, 2 who has fled from Marblehead to Boston. This fellow 
is a cousin of mine. Had ever any man so many rascally cousins 
as I have. I will not presume any danger of that kind, tho I own 
my anxiety is great. Our men inlist but slowly, and the Connecti 
cut troops behave infamously. It was with difficulty the General 
prevented their going off in great numbers last Fryday. However, 
they consented finally to return to their duty, till the army could 
be reinforced. 3 

The General on the first day of our meeting had represented to 
the Court the difficulties he laboured under and the dangers he 
apprehended, and desired a committee to confer with him and the 
other general officers. A committee went down. The result of 
the conference was that 5000 men should be immediately raised 
in this and New Hampshire colony, and brought into camp by the 
loth instant, to supply the deficiencies in the army by the going 
of the Connecticut troops, and the furlows the General is obliged 
to give the new inlisted men by way of encouragement. General 
Sullivan undertook to raise 2000 of them, and we reported that 
the rest should be raised in several parts of this Colony, and yes 
terday sent off more than twenty of our members to effect it, 4 
knowing no other way as our militia is in a perfect state of anarchy, 
some with, and some without officers. If they don t succeed I 
know not where I shall date my next letter from; but I have such

an opinion of my countrymen as to believe they will. The only 
reasons I know of that are assigned by the soldiers for their un 
easiness, or rather backwardness to enter the service again are the 
increase of the officers wages lately made, and the paying them 
contrary to their expectation and former usage by calendar in 
stead of lunar months. The last I have given you my opinion of 
in a former letter, and the first I think was very unluckily timed. 
I have till lately thought it a favourable circumstance that so 
many men were raised in these governments. I begin to think 
otherways, and many reasons operate strongly to make me wish 
for more troops from the southern governments. I pity our good 
General who has a greater burthen on his shoulders and more 
difficulties to struggle with than I think should fall to the share of 
so good a man. I do every thing in my power to relieve him and 
wish I could do more. I see he is fatigued and worried. After all 
you are not to consider us as wholly involved in clouds and dark 
ness. The sun shines for the most part, and we have many consol 
ing events. Providence seems to be engaged for us; the same 
spirit and determination prevails to conquer all difficulties; many 
prizes have been taken by our cruisers, and a capital one last week 
carried into Cape Ann, of very great value, perhaps 20,000 ster 
ling, a brigantine from England with a cargo consisting of almost 
every species of warlike stores, except powder and cannon, 1 2,000 
very fine small arms with all their accoutrements, four mortars, 
one [of] which Putnam has christened and called the Congress, the 
finest one in America, flints, shells, musket balls, carriages, etc., 
etc. These are principally arrived at Headquarters and the great 
mortar is a subject of curiosity. I hope we shall be able to make 
good use of them before long. A small cutter has since been taken 
loaded with provisions from Nova Scotia to Boston, and carried 
into Beverly, 2 the first by a Continental vessel, the second by a 
private one. All serves to distress them and aid us. The reinforcing 
the army has engrossed the whole attention of the General Court 
since their meeting. The manufactory of salt petre proceeds but

i go Warren- Adams Letters [1775 

slowly, tho it is made in small quantities. Our general committee 
seem to me too much entangled with particular systems and gen 
eral rules to succeed in practice. They have done nothing. Colonel 
Orne and Colonel Lincoln have made tryals in the recess and suc 
ceeded according to their wishes. They affirm the process to be 
simple and easy, and that great quantities may be made. They 
shew samples of what they have made, and it is undoubtedly 
good. No experiments with regard to sulphur have yet succeeded. 
We have good proposals with regard to lead. Colonel Palmer has 
promised me to write you on that subject. I hope soon to hear 
from you. The confidence in the Congress prevailing among all 
ranks of people is amazing, and the expectation of great things 
from you stronger than ever. It gives me great pleasure to see 
the credit and reputation of my two particular friends increasing 
here. Their late disinterested conduct, as it is reported here, does 
them much honour. A certain colleague of yours has lost, or I am 
mistaken, a great part of the interest he undeservedly had. 1 Major 
Hawley is not yet down. What he will say to him, I know not. 
Paine, I hear, is gone to gratify his curiosity in Canada. 2 A good 
journey to him. He may possibly do as much good there as at 
Philadelphia, tho I find some people here would not have pitched 
on him for the business we suppose he is gone on, and perhaps 
there are some who would not have done it for any. Many men, 
you know, are of many minds. . . . 

The great loss at Newfoundland of men, etc., I think may be 
considered as an interposition of Providence in our favour. 

Doctor Adams has just called on me to acquaint me that Mr. 
Craige, 3 who has been apothecary to the army, is like to be super- 
ceded, and Mr. Dyre appointed in his room. As he appears to me 
a very clever fellow, and such changes do us no good, I could wish 
it might be prevented.

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADA., Deer. [5], 1 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, Mr. Jonathan B. Smith, who has the Com 
mand of a Party ordered to guard and escorte a Sum of Money to 
your office, will deliver to you this Letter. He is a Gentleman of 
Merit and a Friend to our common Cause. Your Friends here 
have been treated with Civility, and I dare say you will esteem 
him worthy of your particular Notice. 

It will afford you Satisfaction to be informed that Congress has 
granted 133, ooo to the Colony of Massachusetts Bay in part of their 
Account to be exhibited to be paid out of a new Emission already 
orderd to be made, for which the Colony is to be accountable. 

We go on here by Degrees, though not with the Dispatch I could 
wish. Gentlemen seem more and more to enlarge their views, and 
we must be content to wait till the Fruit is ripe before we gather it. 

A few days ago 2 we had Intelligence from Virginia that their 
Governor Lord Dunmore had landed a Party of Regulars, who, 
joynd by a Number of Voluntiers, had attackd and defeated a 
Number of Provincials. His Auxiliaries consisted of the Inhab 
itants of Norfolk, a Town inhabited by Scotch Tories, and such 
weak and timid People as they prevail upon to joyn them. 

Lord Dunmore has issued a Proclamation, calling upon the 
People to resort to the Kings Standard or be deemd Traitors, and 
declaring the indented Servants and Negroes belonging to Rebels, 
who will joyn him free. 3 He has also in the same Proclamation 
declared his Determination to execute Martial Law, thereby tear 
ing up the Foundation of civil Authority and Government in the 
Colony. The Congress taking this under Consideration, have 
recommended to the Colony of Virginia the setting up and exer 
cising civil Government, in like Manner as N. Hampshire and 
South Carolina. 4 

I hope the dispute between the two Houses relating to the 
Establishment of the Militia has before this time subsided or set 
tled. The Council wrote us a Letter upon the Subject, directing

us to give our opinion of the Sense of Congress on the two Resolves 
referrd to either with or without consulting our Brethren as we 
should think best. I had Reasons of weight in my own Mind 
against requesting the formal Determination of Congress: Mr. J. 
Afdams] was of the same Mind. Mr. Qushing] was of a different 
opinion, nor would he agree with us in writing an Answer joyntly. 
We therefore wrote seperately, and, if you think it worth while, 
you may read our Letters which I suppose are in the Council files. 
I intreat you my Friend to joyn with your Compatriots in our 
Colony, in inspiring our Assembly with publick Spirit. There are 
Persons not far from you who watch for Opportunities to disgrace 
the Colony in this Regard. I hope they will never give just occa 
sion to say, "I cannot describe the egregious Want of publick 
Spirit which reigns here." It is exceedingly mortifying to me to 
hear such Paragraphs read. If I ever shall have the inexpressible 
Pleasure of conversing with you, I will candidly tell you who has 
written in this Stile. Thus much I can now assure you, that one at 
least of these Letter writers is not a mean Person. 1 I have many 
things which I wish to say to you with Regard to the internal 
Police of our Colony but I have not Leisure now to write. You 
have Scilla and Charybdis to avoid. You cannot but be perplexd. 
I feel for you; you have need of the Grace of Patience and (though 
it has been long said that I have fallen out with the Word) I will 
add Prudence too. Persevere in that which your heart has ever 
been so warmly engagd in, the Establishment of a Government 
upon the Principles of Liberty, and sufficiently guarding it from 
future Infringements of a Tyrant. I will only add, there may be 
Danger of Errors on the Side of the People which may be fatal to 
your Designs. Adieu.

to give to get rid of the trouble of my many, long and tedious letters, 
I don t know. However, I am determined to write this once more 
at least, not out of spite and malice, but to rectify some errors I 
find I committed in my last, and to remove any impressions of 
despondency the temper I wrote in and the spirit of the letter 
might make. Captain Stevenson who was the bearer of it left us 
last Monday, and I hope will be with you this day. Since which 
I find I was much mistaken in the account I gave you of the prog 
ress of saltpetre in this Colony. It is certainly making in great 
quantities in many towns, and I believe we shall next spring have 
as much as we want. One man in Wrentham had a fortnight ago 
50 lb., one at Sherburne about as much, Dr. Whittaker has 70 lb., 
Parson Whitwell 50, and in the County of Worcester great quanti 
ties are collecting. All agree that the process is as simple and easy 
. as making soap. Our committee at Newberry Port have succeeded 
with some improvements to make steadily 12 lb. a day, and as good 
as I ever saw. So much for saltpetre. We have assigned this after 
noon to choose a committee to erect as soon as possible a powder 
mill at Sutton, and another at Stoughton. Several prizes have 
been taken in the week past, and among the rest a fine ship from 
London, 1 with coal, porter, cheese, live hogs, etc., etc.; and a large 
brigantine from Antigua, 2 with rum, sugar, etc. All the country 
are now engaged in preparing to make salt petre, fixing privateers, 
or reinforcing the army. I suppose if the weather had been favour 
able twelve or thirteen privateers would have been at sea this day 
in quest of seven sail of ships which came out with this prize, and 
had similar cargoes. Commissions are making out for two priva 
teers from Salem, two from Newbury Port, one of them to mount 
sixteen guns. I hear one is fixing at Plymouth, and one at Barn- 
stable. It will be in the power of the Congress another year to 
command the American sea. We have here great numbers of fine 
vessels and seamen in abundance. 

The 3000 militia called to reinforce the army are all I believe in 
camp, and I conjecture some hundreds more than are called for. 
Such was their indignation at the conduct of the Connecticut

troops and zeal for the cause they immediately inlisted and ar 
rived in camp at the time set, tho the travelling is exceeding bad. 
The New Hampshire troops I am told are not behind them. The 
small pox is broke out at Cambridge and one or two other places 
among those late out of Boston. I hope good care will be taken of 
them to prevent its spreading. The inlistments in the army go on 
rather better than they did. Upon the whole the hemisphere is 
brighter and the prospects more agreeable than they were a week 
ago. Our army acknowledge they have been well treated, paid and 
fed, and if you had not raised the pay of the officers, they could 
hardly have found a subject of complaint. I am sorry it was done, 
tho if the soldiers were politicians they might see it was an advan 
tage to [them]. The southern gentlemen seem to have [taken a 
dislike to torn] equality among us, and don t seem [to understand] 
that many of the soldiers are [torn] possessed of as much property 
as [torn]. The people of Boston by their imprudence [torn] town so 
long have given us more trouble [than both] the ministerial army 
and navy. I don t [torn] an eighth part of our whole time since 
[torn] been taken up about them people, and the[y will at] last per 
haps ruin us by spreading [the small pox]. What shall we do? 
Determine not to [receive them], they die. Adieu. . . . 

Just as I finished the above I received your short letter of De 
cember 5. Shall endeavour to reconcile the troops as far as I have 
influence to the terms you mention. The greatest difficulty, how 
ever, is about the officers wages lately raised. Craft[s] I know is 
a deserving man, and fit for the office you mention. Trot I pre 
sume is by the character you give him. But what is to be done 
with Burbeck? He is said to be a good officer, is well esteemed at 
Head quarters, and is now a lieutenant colonel. Do you design 
there shall be two lieutenant colonels, as well as two majors in that 
regiment? What shall be done for our good friend Doctor Cooper? 
He is a staunch friend to the cause, a great sufferer, and no in 
come to support him. Must he not be provided for in the civil list? 
Do devise something. 

It is reported from Boston that they have taken one of our pri 
vateers. 1 I fear it is true.

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADA., Deer. 26, 1775 

MY DEAR SIR, I have receivd your obliging Letter of the 5th 
Instant by Fessenden for which I am very thankful to you. The 
present form of our Government, you tell me, is not considerd as 
permanent. This affords the strongest Motive to improve the 
Advantages of it, while it continues. May not Laws be made and 
Regulations established, under this Government, the salutary 
Effects of which the People shall be so convincd of from their own 
Experience, as never hereafter to suffer them to be repeald or 
alterd. But what other Change is expected? Certainly the People 
do not already hanker after the Onions and the Garlick! They 
cannot have so soon forgot the Tyranny of their late Governors, 
who, being dependent upon, and the mere Creatures of a Minister 
of State, and subservient to his Instructions or Inclinations have 
forbid them to make such Laws as would have been beneficial to 
them or to repeal those that were not. But, I find every where some 
Men, who are affraid of a free Government, lest it should be per 
verted and made use of as a Cloke for Licentiousness. The Fear

of the Peoples abusing their Liberty is made an Argument against 
their having the Enjoyment of it; as if anything were so much to 
be dreaded by Mankind as Slavery. But the Bearer Mr Bromfield, 
of whose Departure I was not apprisd till a few Minutes past, is 
waiting. I can therefore say no more at present, but that I am, 

Your affectionate Friend, 

S. A. 

December 2yth. Mr. Bromfield who went in a Stage Coach set 
off yesterday before I could close my Letter. I shall therefore 
forward it by the Post or any other Conveyance that may next 
offer. 

Your last Letter informd me that "the late Conduct of the 

1 had weakened that Confidence and Reverence necessary 

to give a well disposd Government its full operation and Effects." 
I am sorry for it ; and presume it is not to be imputed to a 
Fault in the Institution of that Order, but a Mistake in the Persons 
of whom it is composd. All men are fond of Power. It is difficult 
for us to be prevaild upon to believe, that we possess more than 
belongs to us. Even publick Bodies of Men legally constituted, are 
too prone to covet more Power than the Publick has judgd it safe 
to entrust them with. It is happy when their Power is not only 
subject to Controul while it is exercisd, but frequently reverts into 
the hands of the People, from whom it is derivd, and to whom Men 
in Power ought forever to be accountable. That venerable As 
sembly the Senate of Areopagus in Athens, whose Proceedings 
were so eminently upright and impartial, that, we are told, even 
* foreign States, when any Controversy happend among them, 
would voluntarily submit to their Decisions . . . not only their 
determinations might be called in Question and, if Need was, re 
tracted by an Assembly of the People, but themselves too, if they 
exceeded the Bounds of Moderation, were lyable to account for it." 

At present, our Council as well as our House of Representatives 
are annually elective. Thus far they are accountable to the People, 
as they are lyable, for Misbehavior, to be discarded. But this is 
not a sufficient Security to the People, unless they are themselves 
virtuous. 

I Council? 



1776] Warren- Adams Letters 197 

If we wish for "another Change," should it not be a Change of 
Manners ? If the Youth are carefully educated, if the Principles 
of Morality are strongly inculcated in the Minds of the People - 
the End and Design of Government clearly understood, and the 
Love of our Country the ruling Passion uncorrupted Men will 
be chosen for the Representatives of the People. 

These will elect Men of distinguished Worth to sit at the Council 
Board, and in time we may hope, that, in the Purity of their Man 
ners, the Wisdom of their Councils and the Justice of their Deter 
minations, our Senate may equal that of Athens, which was said 
to be, "the most sacred and venerable Assembly in all Greece." 
I confess I have a strong Desire, that our Colony should excell in 
Wisdom and Virtue. If this proceeds from Pride, is it not a lawful 
Pride? I am willing that the same Spirit of Emulation may per 
vade every one of the confederated Colonies. But I am called off, 
and must conclude with again assuring you that I am with the 
most friendly Regards to Mrs Warren, very affectionately Yours, 

S. A. 
Pray write to me often. 

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADA., Jany. 7, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, I verily believe the Letters I write to you are 
three to one I receive from you. However I consider the Multi 
plicity of Affairs you must attend to in your various Departments 
and am willing to make due Allowance. 

Your last is dated the I9th of December. It contains a List of 
very important Matters lying before the General Assembly. I am 
much pleased to find that there is an End put to the Contest be 
tween the two Houses concerning the Establishment of a Militia, 
and that you are in hopes of making an effectual Law for that 
Purpose. It is certainly of the last Consequence to a free Country 
that the Militia which is its natural Strength should be kept upon 
the most advantageous Footing. A standing Army, however 
necessary it may be at some times, is always dangerous to the 
Liberties of the People. Soldiers are apt to consider themselves as 



1 98 Warren- Adams Letters [1776 

a Body distinct from the rest of the Citizens. They have their 
Arms always in their hands. Their Rules and their Discipline is 
severe. They soon become attached to their officers and disposd 
to yield implicit obedience to their Commands. Such a Power 
should be watchd with a jealous Eye. I have a good Opinion of 
the principal officers of our Army, I esteem them as Patriots as 
well as Soldiers; But if this War continues, as it may for years yet 
to come, we know not who may succeed them. Men who have 
been long governd by military Laws, and inurd to military Cus 
toms and Habits may lose the Spirit and Feeling of Citizens. And 
even Citizens having been used to admire the Heroism which the 
Commanders of their own Armies have displayd and to look up 
to them as their Saviours, may be prevaild upon to surrender to 
them those Rights for the Protection of which against an Invader, 
they had employd and paid them. We have seen too much of such 
a Disposition among some of our Countrymen. The Militia is 
composd of free Citizens. There is therefore no Danger of their 
making Use of their Power to the Destruction of their own Rights 
or suffering others to invade them. I earnestly wish that young 
Gentlemen of a military Genius, and many such I am satisfied 
there are in our Colony, might be instructed in the Art of War, and 
taught at the same time the Principles of a free Government, and 
deeply impressd with a Sense of that indispensible Obligation 
which every Individual is under to the whole Society. These might 
in Time be fit for Officers in the Militia and being thoroughly 
acquainted with the Duties of Citizens as well as Soldiers might 
be entrusted with a Share in the Command of our Army, at such 
Times as Necessity might require so dangerous a Body to exist. 

I am glad that your Attention is turnd so much to the Importa 
tion of Powder and that the Manufacture of Saltpetre is in so 
flourishing a Way. I cannot think you are restraind by the 
Resolve of Congress from exporting Fish to Spain. I will make 
myself more certain by recurring to our Records tomorrow when 
the Secretary returns; he being at this time (6 o clock P.M.) at 
his House three Miles from Town. And I will inform you by a 
Postscript to this Letter or by another Letter by the Post. I have 
the Pleasure to acquaint you that a Vessel with five Tons of 



Warren- Adams Letters 199 

Powder certainly arrivd at Egg harbour the Night before last, be 
sides two Tons in this River. A Part of it is consignd to the 
Congress The Rest is the Property partly of Mr [Thomas 
Boylston] and partly of a Gentleman in this City. Congress has 
orderd the whole to be purchasd for publick Use. We are also 
informd that Six Tons more arrivd a few days ago in New York 
which I believe to be true. But better still. A Vessel is cer 
tainly arrivd in this River with between fifty and sixty Tons of 
Salt petre. 1 This I suppose will give you more Satisfaction for the 
present than telling you Congress News as you request. 

You ask me, "When you are to hear of our Confederation?" 
;i I answer, When some Gentlemen (to use an Expression of a Tory) 
shall "feel more bold." You know it was formerly a Complaint 
in our Colony, that there was a timid kind of Men, who perpetu 
ally hinderd the Progress of those who would fain run in the Path 
of Virtue and Glory. I find wherever I am that Mankind are alike 
variously classed. I can discern the Magnanimity of the Lyon, the 
Generosity of the Horse, the Tearfulness of the Deer, and the 
Cunning of the Fox I had almost overlookd the Fidelity of the 
Dog. But I forbear to indulge my rambling Pen in this Way lest I 
should be thought chargeable with a Design to degrade the Dig 
nity of our Nature by comparing Men with Beasts. Let me just 
observe to you that I have mentiond only the more excellent 
Properties that are to be found among Quadrupeds. Had I sug 
gested an Idea of the Vanity of the Ape, the Tameness of the Ox, 
or the stupid Servility of the Ass, I might have been lyable to 
Censure. 

Are you Sollicitous to hear of our Confederation? I will tell you. 
It is not dead but sleepeth. A Gentleman of this City told me the 
other day, that he could not believe the People without Doors 
would follow the Congress passibus aequis, if such Measures as 
some called spirited were pursued. I was of a different Opinion. 
It put me in Mind of a Fable of the high-mettled horse and the dull 
horse. My excellent Colleague, Mr. J. A. can repeat to you the 
Fable and if the Improvement had been made of it which our very 
valuable Friend Coll. MfifBin?] proposd, you would have seen that 

I Journals of the Continental Congress, iv. 40.

Confederation compleated long before this time. I do not despair 
of it since our Enemies themselves are hastening it. While I am 
writing an Express arrives from Baltimore in Maryland, with the 
Deposition of Capt. Horn 1 of the Snow Bird belonging to Provi 
dence. 

The Deponent says, that on Monday the 1st Instant he being 
at Hampton in Virginia heard a constant firing of Cannon; that 
he was informd a Messenger had been sent to inquire where the 
firing was, who reported that the Ships of War were cannonading 
the Town of Norfolk; that about the Middle of the Afternoon they 
saw the Smoke ascending from Norfolk, as they supposd; that he 
saild from Hampton the Evening of the same day and the firing 
continued till the next day. This will prevail more than a long 
Train of Reasoning to accomplish a Confederation, and other 
Matters which I know your heart as well as mine is much set upon. 

I forgot to tell you that a Vessel is arrivd in Maryland having 
as part of her Cargo four thousand yards of Sail Cloth an 
article which I hope will be much in Demand in America. Adieu 

my Friend.

exceeding kind offer. If the Exigency of affairs in this Camp 
should make it necessary for her to remove, she cannot but esteem

ing for an oppertunity of shewing every civility in her power to 
Mrs. Warren, at Head Quarters in Cambridge. 

The General begs that his best regards may be presented to 
Mrs. Warren, accompanied with his sincere thanks for her favour 
able wishes for his honour and success; and joins in wishing Mrs.

1776] Warren- Adams Letters 2 oi 



JOHN ADAMS TO MERCY WARREN 

BRAINTREE, Jany. 8, 1776 

DEAR MADAM, Your Friend insists upon my Writing to you 
and altho I am conscious it is my Duty being deeply in Debt for a 
number of very agreeable Favours in the Epistolary Way, yet I 
doubt whether a sense of this Duty would have overcome my 
Inclination to Indolence and Relaxation with which my own Fire 
Side always inspires me, if it had not been Stimulated and quick 
ened by her. 

I was charmed with three Characters drawn by a most masterly 
Pen, which I reed at the southward. Copley s Pencil could not 
have touched off with more exquisite Finishings the Faces of those 
Gentlemen. Whether I ever answered that Letter I know not. 
But I hope Posterity will see it, if they do I am sure they will 
admire it. I think I will make a Bargain with you, to draw the 
Character of every new Personage I have an opportunity of know 
ing, on Condition you will do the same. My View will be to learn 
the Art of penetrating into Men s Bosoms, and then the more 
difficult Art of painting what I shall see there. You Ladies are the 
most infallible judges of Characters, I think. 

Pray Madam, are you for an American Monarchy or Republic? 
Monarchy is the genteelest and most fashionable Government, 
and I dont know why the Ladies ought not to consult Elegance 
and the Fashion as well in Government as Gowns, Bureaus or 
Chariots. 

For my own part I am so tasteless as to prefer a Republic, if 
We must erect an independent Government in America, which 
you know is utterly against my Inclination. But a Republic, altho 
it will infallibly beggar me and my Children, will produce Strength, 
Hardiness Activity, Courage, Fortitude and Enterprise; the manly 
noble and Sublime Qualities in human Nature, in Abundance. 
A Monarchy would probably, somehow or other make me rich, 
but it would produce so much Taste and Politeness so much 
Elegance in Dress, Furniture, Equipage, so much Musick and 
Dancing, so much Fencing and Skaiting, so much Cards and 
Backgammon; so much Horse Racing and Cockfighting, so many 



202 Warren- Adams Letters [1776 

Balls and Assemblies, so many Plays and Concerts that the very 
Imagination of them makes me feel vain, light, frivolous and insig 
nificant. 

It is the Form of Government which gives the decisive Colour 
to the Manners of the People, more than any other Thing. Under 
a well regulated Commonwealth, the People must be wise virtuous 
and cannot be otherwise. Under a Monarchy they may be as 
vicious and foolish as they please, nay, they cannot but be vi 
cious and foolish. As Politicks therefore is the Science of human 
Happiness and human Happiness is clearly best promoted by 
Virtue, what thorough Politician can hesitate who has a new 
Government to build whether to prefer a Commonwealth or a 
Monarchy? 

But, Madam, there is one Difficulty which I know not how to 
get over. 

Virtue and Simplicity of Manners are indispensably necessary 
in a Republic among all orders and Degrees of Men. But there is 
so much Rascallity, so much Venality and Corruption, so much 
Avarice and Ambition such a Rage for Profit and Commerce 
among all Ranks and Degrees of Men even in America, that I some 
times doubt whether there is public Virtue enough to Support a 
Republic. There are two Vices most detestably predominant in 
^every Part of America that I have yet seen which are as incom 
patible with the Spirit of a Commonwealth, as Light is with Dark 
ness; I mean Servility and Flattery. A genuine Republican can 
no more fawn and cringe than he can domineer. Shew me the 
American who cannot do all. I know two or Three, I think, and 
very few more. However, it is the Part of a great Politician to 
make the Character of his People, to extinguish among them the 
Follies and Vices that he sees, and to create in them the Virtues 
and Abilities which he sees wanting. I wish I was sure that 
America has one such Politician but I fear she has not! 1 

A Letter begun in Levity is likely to have . . . [conclusion, 
while I was writing the last Word . . . Paragraph my attention 
was called off ... it and most melodious sounds my Ears . . . more 
Mortars and Musquettry. 1

A very hot Fire, both of Artillery and Small Arms, has continued 
for half an Hour, and has been succeeded by a luminous Phe 
nomenon over Braintree North Common, occasioned by Burning 
Buildings I suppose. 1 

Whether our People have attacked or defended, been victorious 
or vanquished is to me totally uncertain. But in Either Case I 
rejoice, for a Defeat appears to me preferable to total Inaction. 

May the Supreme Ruler of Events overrule in our Favour. But 
if the Event of this Evening is unfortunate I think We ought at 
all Hazards and at any Loss to retrieve it tomorrow. I hope the 
Militia will be ready and our Honour be retrieved by making 
Boston our own. 

I shall be in suspense this Night but very willing to take my 
Place with my Neighbours tomorrow and crush the Power of the 
Enemies or suffer under it. 

I hope Coll Warren sleeps at Cushing s this night and that I 
shall see him in the Morning. Mean Time I think I shall sleep as 
soundly as ever. 

I am Madam your most humble servant and sincere Friend,

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, January 10, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, I wrote to you the 7th Instant by Mr. Anthony 
by the way of Providence, and should not so soon have troubled 
you with another Letter but to inform you, that upon looking over 
the Journals of Congress I find that the Recommendation of the 
26th of October, to export Produce for a certain Purpose, is con- 
find to the foreign West Indies; and the Resolution to stop all 
Trade till the first of March is subsequent to it. This last Resolu 
tion prevents your exporting your Merchantable Fish to Spain 
for the purpose mentiond, which I am satisfied was not intended, 
because I am very certain the Congress means to encourage the 

I See Force, American Archives, 4th Sen, iv. 612. 



204 Warren- Adams Letters [1776 

Importation of those necessary Articles under the Direction of 
proper Persons, from every Part of the World. 

I design to propose to my Colleagues to joyn with me in a 
Motion to extend the Recommendation so as to admit of exporting 
Fish to any place besides the foreign West Indies. 

A few days ago, being one of a Committee to consider General 
Washington s last Letter to Congress, I proposd to the Committee 
and they readily consented to report the inclosd Resolutions, 
which were unanimously agreed to in Congress. 1 The Committee 
also reported that a certain Sum should be paid to Mr. Lovel out 
of the military Chest towards enabling him to remove himself 
and his Family from Boston, but the Precedent was objected to 
and the last Resolve was substituted in its stead. 2 The Gentlemen 
present however contributed and put into my hands Eighty-two 
Dollars for the Benefit of Mr. Lovell, which I shall remit either in 
Cash or a good Bill. I hope I shall soon be so happy as to hear that 
he is releasd from Bondage. I feel very tenderly for the Rest of 
my fellow Citizens who are detaind in that worst of Prisons. 
Methinks there is one way speedily to release them all. 

This day Congress have appointed General Fry a Brigadier 
General of the Army at Cambridge and Coll. Arnold a Brigadier 
General for the Army in Canada. 

Another sum of Money is orderd to be sent to you for the Use 
of the Army. 

Jany. 13. I have sent to Mrs. Adams a Pamphlet 3 which made 
its first Appearance a few days ago. It has fretted some folks here 
more than a little. I recommend it to your Perusal and wish you 
would borrow it of her. Don t be displeasd with me if you find the 
Spirit of it totally repugnant with your Ideas of Government. 
Read it without Prejudice, and give me your impartial Sentiments 
of it when you may be at Leisure. Your Friend.

MERCY WARREN TO ABIGAIL ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 

February 7, 1776 

Just come to hand is a letter from my very worthy friend, 1 who 
I suppose is by this time arrived at Philadelphia; and another from 
his good Portia, whose mind seems to be agitated by a variety of 
passions, passions of the noblest kind, a sense of honnour, of 
friendship, of parental and conjugal affection, of domestic felicity 
and public happiness. I do not wonder you had a struggle within 
yourself when your friend was again called upon to be absent from 
his family for perhaps many months; but as you have sacrificed 
private inclination to the public welfare I hope the reward of vir 
tue will be your portion. I believe the person you consent should 
be absent from you need give himself very little concern about the 
ill-natured sugestions of an envious world, and I cannot think you 
have any apprehension that the whispers of Malice will lessen the 
esteem and affection I have for my friends; and if she is unkindly 
brooding anything to their disadvantage it has not reached my 
ear. When it does I shall comply with your request and give you 
the opportunity you mention. Mean time let me have an explana 
tion of that source of uneasiness you hint at in yours. Follow my 
example and set down immediately and write, and I will ensure 
you a safe conveyance by a gentleman who I hope will call on you 
on saterday on his way to pay a visit to his Marcia. You may 
trust him with your letter though ever so important, and anything 
else you will venture to communicate. 

I want to know if certain intercepted letters had any conse 
quences at Philadelphia. Was any umbrage taken by any genius 
great or small? 

I wonder where Mr. Adams s letter has been for a whole month. 
It might have traveled to Quebec and back again since it was 
wrote. I began to think he was about to drop our correspondence, 
and indeed I think now I am obliged to you for the continuance. 
Yet had I received the letter before he went off I believe I should 
have ventured to answer some of his queries, though they were 
not put in a manner serious enough for me to suppose he expected 

I John Adams.

it. However, when you write again, do make my regards and 
thank him for his of January 8th. Only the fear of interrupting 
his important moments prevents my doing it myself. But I think 
he has so many friends to correspond with that it is rather calling 
him from more useful employment, to attend to my interruptions. 
Yet there is a proposal in his that may set my pen to work again, 
perhaps before he returns. 

I am very sorry for the ill health of your family: hope they are 
all recovered. Do put them in mind of the affection of your friend, 
in a way most pleasing to the little circle. What is become of my 
dear mrs. Lincoln? Do tell her I have impatiently wished through 
the whole winter for the pleasure of hearing from her and the 
family. Do make them my best regards. 

I write in a very great hury, or I should touch a little on politicks, 
knowing you love a little seasoning of that nature in every pro 
duction; but it is too wide a field to enter this evening, so will only 
wish that the aquisition of Boston and Quebec may make the 
opening of the year 76 an era of Glory to the arms of America, 
and may hand down the name of Washington and Arnold to the 
latest posterity, with the laurel on their brow. But a reverse I 
tremble to think off. Let us forbear to name it. So will hasten to 
subscribe the name of your Affectionate friend,

Feby. 18, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, We have at last hit upon a Plan which prom 
ises fair for Success. 

Dr. Franklin and Mr. Chase of Maryland and Mr. Charles Carroll

France, his great Experience in Life, his Wisdom, Prudence, 
Caution; his engaging Address; united to his unshaken Firmness 
in the present American System of Politicks and War, point him 
out as the fittest Character for this momentous Undertaking. 

Chase, is in younger Life, under forty; But deeply impressed 
with a sense of the Importance of securing Canada, very active, 
eloquent, Spirited, and capable. 

Carroll s Name and Character are equally unknown to you. 
I was introduced to him about Eighteen Months ago in this City 
and was much pleased with his Conversation. He has a Fortune 
as I am well informed which is computed to be worth Two hun 
dred Thousand Pounds Sterling. He is a Native of Maryland, and 
his Father is still living. He had a liberal Education in France and 
is well acquainted with the french Nation. He speaks their Lan 
guage as easily as ours; and what is perhaps of more Consequence 
than all the rest, he was educated in the Roman Catholic Religion 
and still continues to worship his Maker according to the Rites of 
that Church. In the Cause of American Liberty his Zeal Forti 
tude and Perseverance have been so conspicuous that he is said 
to be marked out for peculiar Vengeance by the Friends of Admin 
istration; But he continues to hazard his all, his immense Fortune, 
the largest in America, and his Life. This Gentleman s Charac 
ter, if I foresee aright, will hereafter make a greater Figure in 
America. His abilities are very good, his Knowledge and Learning 
extensive. I have seen Writings of his which would convince you 
of this. You may perhaps hear before long more about them. 

These three gentlemen compose a Committee which I think 
promises great Things. 

But We have done more. We have empowered the Committee 
to take with them, another Gentleman of Maryland, Mr. John 
Carroll, 1 a Roman Catholic Priest, and a Jesuit, a Gentleman of 
learning and Abilities. This Gentleman will administer Baptism 
to the Canadian Children and bestow Absolution upon Such as 
have been refused it by the toryfied Priests in Canada. The 
Anathema s of the Church so terrible to the Canadians having 
had a disagreeable Effect upon them.

In Addition to the whole General Lee is ordered into Canada to 
take upon him the Command of the whole Expedition. 1 His 
Address, his Fluency in French, his Activity, his great Experience 
and Skill, We hope will Succeed. 

I long to hear from N. England that the three Regiments are 
marched. It would damp me very much to hear that our People 
continue to hesitate about Bounties, and Trifles. 

The Unanimous Voice of the Continent is Canada must be ours; 
Quebec must be taken. 

I think the most prudent Measures, have now been adopted and 
We must leave the Event. If We fail now, I shall be easy be 
cause I know of nothing more or better that We can do. I did not 
feel so well Satisfied after the News of the Failure at Quebec. 
It is true that We want Lee both at Cambridge and New York! 
But We cannot have him in three Armies at once, and Canada 
Seems to me, the most dangerous Post, and that there is the great 
est Necessity for him there. Schuyler is to command in N. York, 
with Ld Sterling under him, who is a very good officer. 

The Importance of Canada arises from this, and occasions our 
remarkable Unanimity at present in deciding the Affairs of it: 
In the Hands of our Enemies it would enable them to inflame all 
the Indians upon the Continent, and perhaps induce them to take 
up the Hatchet and commit their Robberies and Murders upon 
the Frontiers of all the southern Colonies, as well as to pour down 
Regulars, Canadians, and Indians, together upon the Borders of 
the Northern

I two days ago had the pleasure of receiving yours of February 
1 8th. I think you have taken the best possible methods for the 
security of Canada. Your policy is exquisitely good, and if it fails 
you will nevertheless have the satisfaction of having done every 
thing that humane policy could dictate. I am glad you have taken 
these steps; but they don t satisfy me. I want to see more capital 
ones adopted. I am extremely anxious, perhaps never more so at 
any time. You know I never feared the arms of Britain, but I 
always dreaded their negotiations, aided and assisted as they will 
be by the silly moderation and timidity of some, by the prejudices 
and interested views of others. Surely the honest, virtuous and 
sensible will have enough to do to encounter the plausible subtlety 
of their agents, supported by such confederates. And what adds to 
the misfortune is that you are to have this business on your hands 
at a time when you should be attending to the embassies from the

several (at least trading) powers in Europe, forming alliances to 
support an independence declared many months past. But so it 
is. May God in his good Providence carry us safely through this 
difficulty, and I shall think we have gained the summit of the 
mountain. By the best intelligence we have the Commissioners 
are appointed. They are to consist of thirty-nine, three to each 
Colony; that they are instructed not to treat with Congress. Can 
they with all their negro policy be so stupid as to suppose that they 
will be able to avail themselves of the advantage of getting differ 
ent terms from different colonies, and by that means, without any 
trouble but a voyage from Britain, destroy a union so formidable 
to the existence of that nation? 

Anxiety marks every countenance. People can t account for 
the hesitancy they observe. While some apprehend that you are 
startled at the measures already taken, others wonder why the 
principles and dictates of common sense have not the same influ 
ence upon the enlarged minds of their superiours that they feel on 
their own, and none can see safety or happiness in a future con 
nection with B[ritain], void as they are of true policy, justice or 
humanity. All wish to see a brisk foreign trade, that will both 
\make us rich and safe. 

I am in a poor situation to give you intelligence. I have but a 
very imperfect account of the military operations. The bombard 
ment and cannonade of Boston begun on Saturday last, and our 
army took possession of Dorchester Hill on Monday or Tuesday 
night, without any difficulty, and have strongly entrenched. 
What is to be next I know not. I presume you will have every 
particular from Head quarters. Whether Howe has a design to 
evacuate Boston or not is to me very uncertain, but some circum 
stances look like it. Where he will go if he does, is equally uncer 
tain. Can Administration, with all their stupidity, view with 
indifference the French force in the West Indies, or is not that 
true? If true, it must be important to them or us. No prizes 
lately taken. A ship of 300 tons from Boston to New York, 
mounted with the carriage guns, thirty men, some coal, 7000 can 
non ball, and a few other articles, lately run on shore on the back

account of the three regiments for Canada from those govern

The House have voted a bounty of 6 to those that shall inlist 
for two years into the two battalions to be raised here; of 3 for 
one year; and of thirty shillings to those who shall inlist into any 
of the five battalions left here. I have my doubts and fears about 
this measure. I fear that bounties will rise faster than money can 
depreciate or goods rise. I fear the displeasure of Congress, that 
they will be disgusted. The Board have prudently stopped it 
for the present. I don t know but the result will be to write to you 
before it goes further. 

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADA., March 8, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, I now sit down just to acknowledge the rect of 
your favor of the I4th. of Feby., and to mention to you a Matter 
which considerd in itself may appear to be of small Moment but 
in its effects may possibly be mischievous. I believe I may safely 
appeal to all the Letters which I have written to my Friends since 
I have been in this City to vindicate myself in affirming that I 
have never mentioned Mr. C., 2 nor referred to his Conduct in any 
of them excepting one to my worthy Colleague Mr. A., when he 
was at Watertown a few Weeks ago, in which I informd him of the 
side Mr. C. had taken in a very interesting Debate; and then I only 
observd that he had a Right to give his Opinion whenever he 
thought himself prepard to form one. Yet I have been told it has

General. He died, near Lake George, N.Y., in July, 1776. In the Journals of the House of

been industriously reported that Mr. A. and myself have been 
secretly writing to his Prejudice, and that our Letters have oper 
ated to his being superceded. 1 So fully persuaded did some Gen 
tlemen seem to be of the Truth of this Report, and Mr D[uer] 
of N.Y. in particular, whom I have heard express the warmest 
Affection for Mr. C., that he appeard to be surprizd to hear me 
contradict it. Whether this Report and a Beliefe of it indued the 
Friends of Mr. C. to open a charitable Subscription in Support of 
his Character I am not able to say. If it was so, they ought in Jus 
tice to him to have made themselves certain of the Truth of it; 
for to offer Aid to the Reputation of a Gentleman without a real 
Necessity is surely no Advantage to it. A Letter was handed 
about addressd to Mr. C. The Contents I never saw. His Confi 
dential Friends signd it; other Gentlemen at their Request also 
set their hands to it, perhaps with as much Indifference as a Man 
of Business would give a Shilling to get rid of the Importunity of a 
Beggar. I hear it is supposd in Watertown to be a Vote of Thanks 
of the Congress to Mr. C. for his eminent Services, in which his 
Recall is mentiond with Regrett; but this is most certainly a Mis 
take. The Gentlemen signd it in their private Capacity with Sub 
mission, should they not have addressd it to another person, or 
publishd it to the World after the Manner of other Addresses? 
For if they intended it to recommend Mr. C. to his own Constitu 
ents, was it not hard to oblige him to blow the Trumpet himself 
which they had prepard to sound his Praise. But Major Osgood 
is in haste; I must therefore drop this Subject for the present and 
conclude, affectionately yours.

delphia News Papers you will see what a mighty Question is before 
the Tribunal of the Public. The Decision is yet in suspence, but a 
Guess may be formed what it will be. 

The Day before Yesterday the Committee of Observation of 
this City, a virtuous brave and patriotic Body of Men 100 ii&gt; 
Number, voted with only one dissentient Voice to petition their 
Assembly now sitting, to repeal their deadly Instructions to their 
Delegates in Congress. This Assembly a few days ago, upon a 
Petition from the Same Committee and some other Bodies, has 
voted seventeen additional Members in order to make the Repre 
sentation of this Province more adequate. 

You will soon see a sett of Resolutions, which will please you - 
the Continental Vessells the Provincial Vessells and Letters of 
Marque and Privateers will be let loose upon British Trade. 1 

I hope, and believe it will not be long before Trade will be open. 
Foreign Nations, all the World I hope, will be invited to come 
here, and our People permitted to go to all the World except the 
Dominions of him, who is adjudged to be Nerone Neronior. 

I think the Utmost Encouragement must be given to Trade, 
and therefore We must lay no Duties at present upon Exports and 
Imports, nor attempt to confine our Trade to our own Bottoms 
or our own seamen. This for the present. 

We have so much Work to do, by sea and Land, and so few 
Hands to do it, that We shall not be under any Necessity, nor will 
it be good Policy, I think, to attempt such Restrictions as yet. 

The Act of Assembly here for seventeen additional Representa 
tives will give a finishing Blow to the Quaker Interest in this City 
at least to its Ascendency. It will strip it of all that unjust and 
unequal Power which it formerly had over the Ballance of the 
Province. The Tories here, attribute this Maneuvre to your 
Friends, to whom you are sometimes so partial. If the Charge is 
true, the Posterity of Pennsylvania will have cause to bless your 
Friends from Generation to Generation. 

You can t think how much I am flattered with it. As I have 
the Pleasure of a particular Acquaintance and frequent friendly 
Conversations with several Gentlemen of this City belonging to

JAMES BOWDOIN TO MERCY WARREN 

MlDDLEBOROUGH, March 23, 1776 

I perfectly agree with you, Dear Madam, that G. Britain is in 
a disgraceful situation, not only with regard to what you have 
with great Propriety instanced in, but also in her sending Com 
missioners to treat with those she calls Rebels. These Commission 
ers are probably by this time arrived at Philadelphia, but how they 
can introduce with a good grace, the errand they are come upon, 
is difficult to conjecture. We are told they will not have anything 
to do with the Congress, but will treat with the Colonies sepe- 
rately. If this be their plan, it requires no great share of the 
prophetic spirit to foretell, they will not be able to execute it; for 
it is not likely that any of the united Colonies will enter into a 
seperate treaty with them, but will undoubtedly refer them to the 
Congress, which represents the whole, and which for many reasons 
is the only suitable body to negotiate with them. The ministry 
have hitherto refused to acknowledge that body as the Representa 
tive of the Colonies, and do not allow that the Colonies conjunctly 
can legally be represented at all; and from hence, and also from 
the hope of gaining advantages by seperate treaties, proceeds the 
disinclination to treat with the Congress. But it appears likely 
they must bring their stomachs to it, if they mean to do anything 
in a way of negotiation. The Commissioners have undoubtedly a 
discretional power to act according as they find things circum 
stanced; and when they are informed of the disgraceful precipitate 
flight of their troops from Boston, the firmness and entirety of the 
union of the Colonies, and their preparedness and capacity to 
defend themselves, and therefore that the british troops can make 
no great impression, they will condescend, I imagine, to treat with 
the Congress. But if you should ask, Madame, how will the Con 
gress conduct on this occasion? My answer is, extremely well; for 



1776] Warren- Adams Letters 215 

it is manifest by their proceedings hitherto, they are good politi- 
tians, and have requisites for negotiation good sense, historical 
knowledge, and integrity. The two former of these will secure 
them from imposition and circumvention, and the latter, I trust, 
from bribery and corruption. If they are not corruptible, we need 
not be distressed about the issue of the negotiation. But as 
M[inis]try are said to be complete Adepts in the practice and acts 
of bribery, it is highly probable those they employ on so interesting 
and important an occasion are not less so; and come amply pro 
vided from the national coffers with the means of it. They are 
therefore in an especial manner to be guarded against in that view. 
If a treaty should be entered upon, I apprehend it cannot be done 
with dignity and propriety on the part of America, before the 
whole british Armament both by sea and land depart from Amer 
ica; and this ought to be insisted on as an essential preliminary to 
the negotiation. In this idea some Europeans do, and all Ameri 
cans should, concur. 

As to the treaty itself, in order to be lasting, it must be founded 
on meer interest, the mutual interest of the parties; the free dis 
cussion and settlement of which imply mutual independance, 
without which it is in vain to expect they can take place. In order 
to such a discussion, settlement, does it not seem necessary on our 
part, there should be a declaration of independance on Great 
Britain? and without such a declaration, must not the Congress 
enter upon the treaty with great disadvantage? as their silence 
on that head will be construed to imply an acknowledgement, 
that the Interests of America are to be considered as subordinate 
to those of Great Britain, and to be regarded no farther than they 
have a tendency to promote her interests. 

Divers objections may be made against such a declaration: but 
I would refer the objector to that excellent Pamphlet intitled 
Common Sense; which, if he is not influenced by private interest 
and attachment, will probably silence all his objections, and disci-"" 
pie him to the author s doctrine, that an Independance on_Great 
^ bein^-of 



the_Cc4onies. Thus, Madame, in obedience to your Command, 
for such I esteem the most distant intimation of your pleasure, I

have given you some crude thoughts on the subject of the expected 
negotiation. I wish they were intitled to the approbation of so 
good a judge in politics. Such as they are, I beg leave to submit 
them to your candour, and am with the greatest Esteem, Madame, 
your most obedt. and very hble. servt.,

March 29, 1776 

Since the joyfull News of the Reduction of Boston by the Forces 
of the united Colonies, my Mind has been constantly engaged 
with Plans and Schemes for the Fortification of the Islands and 
Channells in Boston Harbour. I think that if Cannon and Ammu 
nition, in the necessary Quantities can possibly be obtained, Forti 
fications ought to be erected upon Point Alderton, Lovells Island, 
George s Island, Castle Island and Governor s Island, Long 
Island and Moon Island, and Squantum, the Heights of Dorches 
ter and Charlestown and Noddle s Island. The Expence of the 
Quantities of Cannon necessary to make this Harbour impregnable, 
will be very great, But this must not be regarded. 

Cannot Vesseaux de Frize be placed in the Channell? Cannot 
Hulks be sunk? Cannot Booms be laid across? Nay, cannot the 
Channell be filled up or at least obstructed with Stone? 

Cannot Fire be employed as a Defence? I mean Fire Ships and 
Fire Rafts? Cannot Gallies or floating Batteries be used to 
Advantage? 

We suppose that the Fleet and Army, under General Howe are 
gone to Hallif ax with Design to go up the River of Saint Lawrence, 
as early as possible in the Spring. They may go up the River early 
in May, if not the latter end of April.

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
WATERTOWN, March 30, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, When I wrote you last I was at Plymouth 
sick and confined. I did not return to this place till three days ago. 
On my way Mrs. Warren and I lodged at Braintree, and had the 
pleasure of finding Mrs. Adams and family well. Here I find the 
world turned topsy turvy to such a degree that I can scarcely 
realize the present appearances of things; the enemies army fled 
and our own marching into other colonies. The last division of the 
British fleet sailed on Wednesday last. I had a view of them with 
out the lighthouse from Pens Hill, about sixty or seventy sail. 
They made a pretty appearance. What their destination is we are 
not able to ascertain. The general opinion is that they are gone 
to Halifax, and some circumstances seem to confirm it. I presume 
before this you have had a full account of their principle embarka 
tion, their fright and their depredations, etc., etc. Two or three 
ships only, with one of their store ships ashore on George s Island, 
remain in the harbour. Four hundred of our men under the com 
mand of Colonel Tupper l were to have gone last evening on 
Petticks Island with some artillery, to render their station uneasy, 
and perhaps destroy the store ship. I suppose the storm may have 
prevented. What is to be the next movement of the British fleet 
and army, I can t devise. There is no reasoning on their conduct 
and I must leave abler heads than mine to conjecture. The Gen 
eral proposes to leave only four or five regiments here. This num-

her we think very small, considering that we have been first and 
principally marked for vengeance and destruction, and the possi 
bility and even probability that the attack may be renewed, as 
well as the necessity of fortifying the harbour of Boston. 1 But we 
must submit. We have a committee gone to view the harbour of 
Boston, and to report the best method of securing it. Whether 
that will be best done by fortifications or by obstructing the chan 
nels, or by both, I can t say, but surely it ought to be done effec 
tually and speedily. Who is to command here I don t learn. Gen 
eral Ward perhaps, if his resignation (which I hear he has sent) 
don t prevent, by being accepted before a subsequent letter he is 
said to have wrote reaches you. 2 

Upon my arrival here I applyed to the General to know what he 
expected from me as paymaster on this occassion. His answer was 
that he expected I should go with the army, but was content, if it 
was more agreeable to me, that I should send somebody I could 
rely on. I could not see the necessity of this, as there must be and 
undoubtedly is a paymaster at [New] York; but he thought it 
regular the Paymaster General should be with the Commander in 
Chief. As my interest and connections here are such as would ren 
der it very disagreeable and scarcely honourable for me to leave 
this Colony, for the emoluments of that office, I desired him to 
accept my resignation. But as I was appointed by Congress, he 
declined it. I am therefore obliged to employ Mr. William Win- 
throp to accompany the army to [New] York. I can confide in 
him as well as any young gentleman, but I don t incline to trust 
such a risque in any hands. I shall therefore inclose to Congress, 
or rather to the President, a resignation, which you will please to 
see, seal and deliver, if I am not to be continued here. 3 How the 
troops that are left are to be paid and supported without a pay 
master, I don t know. If a committee could be appointed this way 
to examine my accounts, I should be glad; if not, I suppose I must

letter by him. It gives me fresh spirits. Thank Mr. Gerry for his 
last. I will write him as soon as I can. I am now much hurried, as 
the army is in such motion. I trust and believe there will be abun 
dant reason for many generations yet to come to bless my particu 
lar friends. We are forming under the auspices and great influence 
of a fee bill that will drive every man of interest and ability out 
of office. I dread the consequences of the leveling spirit, encour 
aged and drove to such lengths as it is. As to more general matters, 
people are as they should be, the harvest is mature. I can t de 
scribe the sighing after independence; it is universal. Nothing 
remains of that prudence, moderation or timidity with which we 
have so long been plagued and embarrassed. All are united in this 
question. 

The letter I mentioned above to your President I have sent 
open to you, not only that you might see it, but that you might do 
with it as you please. If you would advise me yet to hold this 
place, you will keep it in your own hands. I shall be perfectly 
satisfied with whatever you do with it, knowing that friendship 
will direct your conduct in this matter. I can hardly determine 
what to do myself, not having such circumstances to judge from 
as you have. I have forwarded your letters, etc., to Mrs. Adams

Family are that it is not in any of our powers to accept your 
polite and friendly Invitation, nor will it be in my power. I am 
persuaded, to thank you personally for the polite attention, you 
have shewn me since I came into this province. I must therefore 
beg your acceptance of them in this way and at this time, and that 
you will be assured that I shall hold them in gratefull remem 
brance. I am desired by the General to offer you his sincere thanks 
for your kind wishes and to present his compliments along with 
Mr. and Mrs. Custis s 2 and my own to you and Cols. Warren. 
With every sentiment of esteem I am and shall remane to be, 
your much obliged Friend and Hble. Servant.

tions which are new to me I thought it might not be uninteresting 
to you. 

Howe has put 3000 Troops on board of Transports which lie, 
or at least lay last Saturday, at Staten Island. Whether this is a 
Feint or a serious Maneuvre, with Intention to go to the Eastern 
shore of Cheasapeak Bay, as they give out, I dont know or whether 
they aim at this City. I rather Suspect they mean another Course, 
i.e. up Hudsons River but Time will discover. 

For God s sake and the Land s sake send along your Troops. 
They are wanted very much I hope General Washington has 
informed you how much. Troops are now coming from North 
Carolina, Virginia and Maryland. If they come here We shall 
have scuffle for this City. The Languor of New England surprises 
me. If there had been half the Energy in those Governments that 
there was two years ago, Howe would now have been in Another 
World or the most miserable Man in this.

JOHN ADAMS TO MERCY WARREN 

April 1 6, 1776 

MADAM, Not untill yesterday s Post did your agreeable Fa 
vour of March the Tenth come to my Hands. It gave me great 
Pleasure, and altho in the distracted Kind of Life I am obliged to 
lead, I cannot promise to deserve a Continuance of so excellent a 
Correspondence, yet I am determined by Scribbling Something 
or other, be it what it may, to provoke it. 

The Ladies I think are the greatest Politicians that I have the 
Honour to be acquainted with, not only because they act upon the 
Sublimest of all the Principles of Policy, viz., that Honesty is the 
best Policy, but because they consider Questions more coolly than 
those who are heated with Party Zeal and inflamed with the bitter 
Contentions of active public Life. 

I know of no Researches in any of the sciences more ingenious 
than those which have been made after the best Forms of Govern 
ment, nor can there be a more agreeable Employment to a benevo 
lent Heart. The Time is now approaching when the Colonies will 



222 Warren- Adams Letters [1776 

find themselves under a Necessity, of engaging in Earnest in this 
great and indispensible Work. I have ever Thought it the most 
difficult and dangerous Part of the Business Americans have to do 
in this mighty Contest, to contrive some Method for the Colonies 
to glide insensibly, from under the old Government, into a peace 
able and contented submission to new ones. It is a long Time 
since this Opinion was conceived, and it has never been out of my 
Mind. My constant Endeavour has been to convince Gentlemen 
of the Necessity of turning their Thoughts to these subjects. At 
present, the sense of this Necessity seems to be general, and Meas 
ures are taking which must terminate in a compleat Revolution. 
There is Danger of Convulsions, but I hope, not great ones. 

The Form of Government, which you admire, when its Princi 
ples are pure is admirable, indeed, it is productive of every Thing, 
which is great and excellent among Men. But its Principles are 
as easily destroyed, as human Nature is corrupted. Such a Gov 
ernment is only to be supported by pure Religion or Austere Mor 
als. Public Virtue cannot exist in a Nation without private, and 
public Virtue is the only Foundation of Republics. There must be 
a positive Passion for the public good, the public Interest, Honour, 
Power and Glory, established in the Minds of the People, or there 
can be no Republican Government, nor any real Liberty: and this 
public Passion must be Superiour to all private Passions. Men 
must be ready, they must pride themselves, and be happy to sacri 
fice their private Pleasures, Passions and Interests, nay, their pri 
vate Friendships and dearest Connections, when they stand in 
Competition with the Rights of Society. 

Is there in the World a Nation, which deserves this Character? 
There have been several, but they are no more. Our dear Ameri 
cans perhaps have as much of it as any Nation now existing, and 
New England perhaps has more than the rest of America. But I 
have seen all along my Life Such Selfishness and Littleness even in 
New England, that I sometimes tremble to think that, altho We 
are engaged in the best Cause that ever employed the Human 
Heart yet the Prospect of success is doubtful not for Want of 
Power or of Wisdom but of Virtue. 

The Spirit of Commerce, Madam, which even insinuates itself 



i?7 6 ] Warren* Adams Letters 223 

into Families, and influences holy Matrimony, and thereby cor 
rupts the morals of families as well as destroys their Happiness, it 
is much to be feared is incompatible with that purity of Heart and 
Greatness of soul which is necessary for an happy Republic. 

This Same Spirit of Commerce is as rampant in New England 
as in any Part of the World. Trade is as well understood and as 
passionately loved there as any where. 

Even the Farmers and Tradesmen are addicted to Commerce; 
and it is too true that Property is generally the standard of Re 
spect there as much as anywhere. While this is the Case there is 
great Danger that a Republican Government would be very fac 
tious and turbulent there. Divisions in Elections are much to be 
dreaded. Every man must seriously set himself to root out his 
Passions, Prejudices and Attachments, and to get the better of 
his private Interest. The only reputable Principle and Doctrine 
must be that all Things must give Way to the public. 

This is very grave and solemn Discourse to a Lady. True, and 
I thank God, that his Providence has made me Acquainted with 
two Ladies at least who can bear it. I think Madam, that the 
Union of the Colonies, will continue and be more firmly cemented. 
But We must move slowly. Patience, Patience, Patience! I am 
obliged to invoke this every Morning of my Life, every Noon and 
every Evening. 

It is surprising to me that any among you should flatter them 
selves with an Accommodation. Every appearance is against it, 
to an Attentive observer. The Story of Commissioners is a Bub 
ble. Their real Errand is an Insult. But popular Passions and 
Fancies will have their Course, you may as well reason down a Gale 
of Wind. 

You expect if a certain Bargain Should be complied with to be 
made acquainted with noble and Royal Characters. But in this 
you will be disappointed. Your Correspondent, has neither Prin 
ciples, nor Address, nor Abilities for such Scenes, and others are 
as sensible of it, I assure you, as he is. They must be Persons of 
more Complaisance and Ductility of Temper as well as better 
Accomplishments for such great Things. 

He wishes for nothing less, he wishes for nothing more than to

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, April 16, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, I have not yet congratulated you on the unex 
pected and happy Change of our Affairs in the removal of the 
Rebel Army from Boston. Our worthy Friend Major H[awley] in 
his Letter to me declines giving me Joy on this Occasion. He 
thinks it best to put off the Ceremony till the Congress shall pro 
claim Independency. In my Opinion, however, it becomes us to 
rejoyce and religiously to acknowledge the Goodness of the Su 
preme Being who in this Instance hath signally appeard for us. 
Our Countrymen are too wise to suffer this favorable Event to put 
them off their Guard. They will fortify the Harbour of Boston, 
still defend the Sea Coasts and keep the military Spirit univer 
sally alive. I perfectly agree with the Major in his Opinion of the 
Necessity of proclaiming Independency. The Salvation of this 
Country depends upon its being done speedily. I am anxious to 
have it done. Every Day s Delay trys my Patience. I can give 
you not the least Color of a Reason why it is not done. We are 
told that Commissioners are coming out to offer us such Terms of 
Reconciliation as we may with Safety accept of. Why then should 
we shut the Door? This is all Amusement. I am exceedingly 
disgusted when I hear it mentiond. Experience should teach us 
to pay no Regard to it. We know that it has been the constant 
Practice of the King and his Junto ever since this Struggle began 
to endeavor to make us believe their Designs were pacifick, while 
they have been meditating the most destructive Plans, and they 
insult our understandings by attempting thus to impose upon us 
even while they are putting these Plans into Execution. Can the 
King repeal or dispense with Acts of Parliament? Would he 
repeal the detestable Acts which we have complaind of, if it was 
in his Power. Did he ever show a Disposition to do Acts of Jus- 



1 77 6] barren- Adams Letters 225 

tice and redress the Grievances of his Subjects? Why then do 
Gentlemen expect it? They do not scruple to own that he is a 
Tyrant; Are they then willing to be his Slaves and dependent 
upon a Nation so lost to all Sense of Liberty and Virtue as to en 
able and encourage him to act the Tyrant? This has been done by 
the British Nation against the Remonstrances of common Hon 
esty and common Sense. They are now doing it and will continue 
to do it, until we break the Band of Connection and publickly 
avow an Independence. It is Folly for us to suffer ourselves any 
longer to be amusd. Reconciliation upon reasonable Terms is no 
Part of their Plan: The only Alternative is Independence or Slav 
ery. Their Designs still are as they ever have been to subjugate 
us. Our unalterable Resolution should be to be free. They have 
attempted to subdue us by Force, but God be praisd! in vain. 
Their Arts may be more dangerous than their Arms. Let us then 
renounce all Treaty with them upon any score but that of total 
Seperation, and under God trust our Cause to our Swords. One 
of our moderate prudent Whigs would be startled at what I now 
write I do not correspond with such kind of Men. You know 
I never overmuch admired them. Their Moderation has brought 
us to this Pass, and if they were to be regarded, they would con 
tinue the Conflict a Century. There are such moderate Men here, 
but their Principles are daily going out of Fashion. The Child 
Independence is now struggling for Birth. I trust that in a short 
time it will be brought forth and in Spite of Pharaoh all America 
shall hail the dignified Stranger.

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

April 1 6, 1776 

DEAR SIR, I agree with you in yours of 30 March in opinion 
that five Regiments are too Small a Force to be left with you, con 
sidering the Necessity of fortifying the Harbour, and the Danger 
there is that the Enemy may renew their Designs upon our Prov 
ince. Am happy to learn that you have sent a Committee to view 
the Harbour of Boston and report the best Method of Securing it. 



226 Warren- Adams Letters [1776 

When this Report is made I beg it may be transmitted to me. I 
wish you could transmit to me a good Plan of the Harbour at the 
same Time, for I want to convince this Congress that that Har 
bour may be made as strong and impregnable as Gibraltar, that 
they may be induced to contribute somewhat to the Fortification 
of it. I have a great opinion of the Efficacy of Fire, both in Rafts 
and Ships, for the Defence of that Harbour, among the numerous 
Shoals and Narrows and the Multitudes of Islands. Will not 
Row Gallies be very usefull? Would not they dodge about among 
those Islands and hide themselves at one Time, and make them 
selves dangerous to a ship at another? 

Batteries must not be omitted upon the Heights on the Islands. 
Nor must We forget to obstruct the Channell. I am a miserable 
Engineer, I believe, but I will not Scruple to expose my own 
Ignorance in this Usefull science for the Sake of throwing out any 
broken Hints for refreshing the Memories of others who know 
more. If I was to write a Letter to my little Tom 1 I should say 
something to him about fortifying Boston Harbour. 

Your Letter to the President I have shewn to My Friends 
Mr. Adams and Mr. Gerry. It has puzzled me a little what to do 
with it; but We are all of opinion upon the whole that it will be 
most for your Honour to deliver it, and indeed for your Interest, 
for there will be too much Risque in trusting this office to any one 
you can employ at a Distance from you. 

You inform me that the Council have appointed [Foster] and 
[Sullivan] Judges. What, sir, do you think must be my Feelings 
upon this Occasion? I wish you would acquaint me whether 
Mr. Reed has accepted, and what the Court intends to do, about 
the Commissions and Salaries of the Judges. Whether they are to 
lie at the Mercy of Coll. Thompson, Coll. Bowers and Mr. Brown 
of Abington. 

This is a great Constitutional Point in which the Lives, Liber 
ties, Estates, and Reputations of the people are concerned, as well 
as the Order and Firmness of Government in all its Branches, and 
the Morals of the People besides. I may be suspected of sinister 
and interested Views in this, but I will give any Man a Pension

out of my own private Fortune to take my Place. ^It is upon 
Principle, and from this Principle, let Major Hawley think of it as 
he may, I cannot depart. 

You will learn the Exploits of our Fleet, before you get this. 
They have behaved as all our Forces behave by Sea and Land. 
Every day convinces us that our People are equal to every Serv 
ice of War or Peace by Sea or Land. 

You say the Sigh s for Independence are universal. You say too 
what I can scarcely believe, that Moderation and Timidity are at 
an End. How is this possible? Is Cunning at an End too and 
Reserve and hinting against a Measure that a Man dare not 
oppose directly or disapprove openly? Is trimming at an End too? 
and Duplicity? and Hypocrisy? If they are, I give you Joy, sir, 
of a group of Tyrants gone. But I have not yet Faith in all this. 
You deal in theMarvellous like a Traveller. As to the Sighs, what 
are they after? Independence? Have We not been independent 
these twelve Months, wanting Three days? 

Have you seen the Privateering Resolves? Are not these Inde 
pendence enough for my beloved Constituents? Have you seen 
the Resolves for opening our Ports to all Nations ? L Are these Inde 
pendence enough? What more would you have? Why Methinks I 
hear you say, We want to compleat our Form and Plan of Gov 
ernment. Why don t you petition Congress then for Leave to 
establish such a Form as shall be most conducive to the Happiness 
of the People? But you say, Why don t the Southern Colonies 
Seize upon the Government? That I can t answer but by all 
We can learn they are about it, every where. We want a Confed 
eration, you will say. True. This must be obtained. But we are 
united now, they say, and the Difference between Union and Con 
federation is only the same with that between an express and an 
implied Contract. 

But We ought to form Alliances. With Whom? What Alliances? 
You don t mean to exchange British for French tyranny. No, You 
don t mean to ask the Protection of French Armies. No, we had 
better depend upon our own. We only Want commercial Treaties.

Try the Experiment without them. But France and England will

good luck to get it. 

But you will say what is your own opinion of these Things? I 
answer, I would not tell you all that I have said, and written, and 
done in this Business for a shilling, because Letters are now a days 
jumpd after. Why don t your Honours of the General Court, if 
you are so unanimous in this, give positive Instructions to your

Delegates untill they have disobeyed your Instructions in favour 
of Independency. The S[outhern] Colonies say you are afraid.

WATERTOWN, April 17, 1776 

If my dear friend required only a very long Letter to make it 
agreeable, I could Easily Gratify her, but I know there Must be 
Many More Requisits to make it pleaseing to her taste. If you 
Measure by lines, I can at once comply; if by Sentiment, I fear I 
shall fall short. But as a Curiosity seems to be awake with Respect 
to the Company I keep and the Manner of Spending My time, I 
will Endeavor to Gratify you. I arrived at my lodgings before 
dinner the day I left you: found an obligeing family, Convenient 
Room and in the Main an Agreeable Set of Lodgers. Next Morn 
ing I took a ride to Cambridge and waited on Mrs. W[ashingto]n, 
at a II o clock, where J_ was Received with that politeness and 
Respect shown in a first interview among the well bred, and with 
the Ease and Cordiality of friendship of a Much Earlier date. If 
you wish to hear more of this Lady s Character, I will tell you the 
Complacency of her Manners Speaks at once the Benevolence of 
her heart, and her affability, Cander, and Gentleness Qualify her 
to soften the hours of private Life, or to Sweeten the Cares of the 
Hero, and Smooth the Rugged pains of War. I did not dine with 
her, tho Much Urged. She desired me to Name an Early hour in 
the Morning when She would send her Chariot and accompany 
me to see the deserted Lines of the Enemy and the Ruins of

barity of the Foe and leaves a deep impression of the Sufferings of 
that unhappy Town. Mr. Custice is the only Son of the Lady 
above described a Sensible, Modest, agreeable Young Man. 
His Lady, a daughter of Coll. Calverts of Mariland, appears to be 
as [of] an Engaging Disposition, but of so Extrem Delicate a 
Constitution that it Deprives her as well as her friends of part of 
the pleasure which I am persuaded would result from her Conver 
sation did she Enjoy a greater Share of Health. She is pritty gen 
teel, Easey and agreeable, but a kind of Langour about her pre 
vents her being sociable as some Ladies. Yet it is evident it is not 
owing to that want of Vivacity which Renders Youth agreeable, 
but to a want of health which a Little Clouds her Spirits. This 
family which Consists of about 8 or 9 was prevented dining with 
us the Tuesday following by an Alarm from Newport, but calld 
and took leave of us the Next day, when I own I felt that kind of 
pain which arises from Affections when the Object of Esteem is 
Seperated perhaps forever. After this I kept House a Week amus 
ing Myself with My Book, My work, and Sometimes a Letter to an 
absent friend. My Next Visit was to Mrs. Morgan, but as you are 
acquainted with her I shall Not be particular with regard to her 
person or Manners. The Dr. and she dined with us last Saturday 
in Company with General Putnam s Lady. She is what is Com 
monly called a very Good kind of Woman, and Commands Esteem 
without the Graces of politeness, the Briliancy of Wit, or theMerits 
of peculiar Understanding above the Rest of her Sex, yet to be 
Valued for an Honest, unornamented, plain hearted friendship 
Discovered in her Deportment at the first acquaintance. All 
other Characters or Occurrences I shall leave for another opper- 
tunity only shall Mention a Lady who has been a Lodger in 
our family for a week past and has been a great addition to the 
Chearfulness and Good Humour of the family. It is a Mrs. Orn 
of Marblehead, 1 a well disposed pleasant agreeable Woman. 

The more regard you Express for a friend of Mine, the Greater 
My Obligation. I have sent forward My Letter to Mr. Adams, but 
Suppose I should have No answer unless Stimulated by you.

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

April 20th, 1776 

Last evening a Letter was received by a Friend of yours, from 
Mr. John Penn, one of the Delegates from North Carolina, lately 
returned home to attend the Convention of that Colony, in which 
he informs, that he heard nothing praised in the Course of his 
Journey, .r^ut Common Sense and Independence. That this was 
the Cry throughout Virginia. That North Carolina were making 
great Preparations for War, and were determined to die poor and 
to die hard if they must die in Defence of their Liberties. That 
they had repealed, or should repeal their Instructions to their 
Delegates against Independence. That South Carolina had as 
sumed a Government, chosen a Council, and John Rutledge, Esqr., 
President of that Council, with all the Powers of a Governor; that 
they have appointed Judges, and that Drayton 1 is Chief Justice. 
"In short, sir," says this Letter, "the Vehemence of the Southern 
Colonies is such as will require the Coolness of the Northern 
Colonies, to restrain them from running to Excess." 

Inclosed you have a little Pamphlet, the Rise and Progress of 
which you shall be told. Mr. Hooper and Mr. Penn of North 
Carolina received from their Friends in that Colony very pressing 
Instances to return home and attend the Convention, and at the 
Same Time to bring with them every Hint they could collect con 
cerning Government. 

Mr. Hooper applied to a certain Gentleman, 2 acquainted him 
with the Tenor of his Letters, and requested that Gentleman to 
give him his sentiments upon the subject. Soon afterwards Mr. 
Penn applied to the Same Gentleman and acquainted him with 
the Contents of his Letters, and requested the Same Favour.

The Time was very short. However the Gentleman thinking 
it an opportunity providentially thrown in his Way, of communi 
cating Some Hints upon a subject which seems not to have been 
sufficiently considered in the Southern Colonies, and so of turning 
the Thoughts of Gentlemen that Way, concluded to borrow a 
little Time from his Sleep and accordingly wrote with his own 
Hand, a Sketch, which he copied, giving the original to Mr. 
Hooper and the Copy to Mr. Penn, which they carried with them 
to Carolina. Mr. Wythe getting a sight of it, desired a Copy which 
the Gentleman made out from his Memory as nearly as he could. 
Afterwards Mr. Serjeant of New Jersey requested another, which 
the Gentleman made out again from Memory, and in this he en 
larged and amplified a good deal, and sent it to Princetown. After 
this Coll. Lee, requested the same Favour, but the Gentleman 
having written amidst all his Engagements five Copies, or rather 
five sketches, for no one of them was a Copy of the other, which 
amounted to Ten Sheets of Paper, pretty full and in a fine Hand, 
was quite weary of the office. To avoid the Trouble of writing any 
more he borrowed Mr. Wythe s Copy and lent it to Coll. Lee, who 
has put it under Types and thrown it into the shape you see. 1 It 
is a Pity it had not been Mr. Serjeant s Copy, for that is larger 
and more compleat, perhaps more correct. This is very incorrect, 
and not truly printed. The Design however is to mark out a Path, 
and putt Men upon thinking. I would not have this Matter com 
municated. 

I think by all the Intelligence We have that North Carolina 
Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey will erect Governments, be 
fore the Month of June expires. And, if New York should do so 
too, Pennsylvania, will not neglect it at least I think so. 

There is a particular Circumstance relative to Maryland, which 
you will learn e er long, but am not at Liberty to mention at 
present, but will produce important Consequences in our favour, 
I think. 

But, after Governments shall be assumed, and a confederation 
formed, We shall have a long obstinate and bloody War to go

through and all the Arts, and Intrigues of our Enemies as well as 
the Weakness and Credulity of our Friends to guard against. 

A Mind as vast as the Ocean or Atmosphere is necessary to 
penetrate and comprehend all the intricate and complicated Inter 
ests which compose the Machine of the Confederate Colonies. It 
requires all the Philosophy I am Master of, and more than all, at 
Times to preserve that Serenity of Mind and Steadiness of Heart 
which is necessary to watch the Motions of Friends and Enemies, 
of the Violent and the Timid, the Credulous and the dull, as well as 
the Wicked. 

But if I can contribute ever so little towards preserving the 
Principles of Virtue and Freedom in the World my Time and Life 
will be not ill spent. 

A Man must have a wider Expansion of Genius than has fallen 
to my share to see to the End of these great Commotions. But 
on such a full Sea are We now afloat that We must be content to 
trust to Winds and Currents with the best Skill We have under a 
kind Providence to land us in a Port of Peace, Liberty and Safety.

The Management of so complicated and mighty a Machine, as 
the United Colonies, requires the Meekness of Moses, the Patience, 
of Job and the Wisdom of Solomon, added to the Valour of 
David. 

They are advancing by slow but sure Steps, to that mighty 
Revolution, which You and I have expected for Some Time. 
Forced Attempts to accellerate their Motions, would have been 
attended with Discontent and perhaps Convulsions. 
^ The News from South Carolina has aroused and animated all the 
Continent. It has Spread a visible Joy, and if North Carolina and 
Virginia should follow the Example, it will spread through all the 
rest of the Colonies like Electric Fire. 

The Royal Proclamation, and the late Act of Parliament have 
convinced the doubting and confirmed the timorous and wavering.

The two Proprietary Colonies only are still cool, But I hope a few 
Weeks will alter their Temper. 

I think, it is now the precise Point of Time for our Council and 
House of Representatives either to proceed to make such Altera 
tions in our Constitution as they may judge proper, or to Send a 
Petition to Philadelphia for the Consent of Congress to do it. It 
will be considered as fresh Evidence of our Spirit and Vigour, and 
will give Life and Activity and Energy to all the other Colonies. 
Four Months ago, or indeed at any Time since you assumed a 
Government, it might have been disagreeable and perhaps dan 
gerous; but it is quite otherwise now. Another Thing, if you are 
so unanimous in the Measure of Independency and wish for a 
Declaration of it, now is the proper Time for you to instruct your 
Delegates to that Effect. It would have been productive of 
Jealousies, perhaps, and Animosities a few Months ago, but would 
have a contrary Tendency now. The Colonies are all at this Mo 
ment turning their Eyes that Way. Vast Majorities in all the 
Colonies now see the Propriety and Necessity of taking the deci 
sive Steps, and those who are averse to it are afraid to Say much 
against it, and therefore Such an Instruction at this Time would 
comfort and cheer the Spirits of your Friends, and would discour 
age and dishearten your Enemies. 

Coll. Whipple s Letters from New Hampshire are nearly in the 
Same Strain with yours to me, vizt. that all are now united in the 
great Question. His Letters inform him that even of the Protest 
ers there is now but one left, who is not zealous for Independency. 

I lament the Loss of Governor Ward exceedingly, because he 
had many Correspondents in Rhode Island, whose Letters were 
of service to Us, an Advantage which is now entirely lost. 1 

After all, my Friend, I do not att all Wonder, that so much 
Reluctance has been shewn to the Measure of Independency. All 
great Changes are irksome to the human Mind, especially those 
which are attended with great Dangers and uncertain Effects. 
No Man living can foresee the Consequences of such a Measure,

the Design of Providence by a Series of great Events had so plainly 
marked out the Necessity of it that he who runs might read. 

We may feel a Sanguine Confidence of our Strength! Yet in a 
few Years it may be put to the Tryal. 

We may please ourselves with the prospect of free and popular 
Governments, but there is great Danger that these Governments 
will not make Us happy. God grant they may. But I fear, that 
in every Assembly, Members will obtain an Influence, by Noise 
not Sense, by Meanness not Greatness, by Ignorance not Learning, 
by contracted Hearts not large Souls. I fear, too, that it will be 
impossible to convince and persuade People to establish wise 
Regulations. 

There is one Thing, my dear Sir, that must be attempted and 
most Sacredly observed, or We are all undone. There must be a 
Decency, and Respect, and Veneration introduced for Persons in 
Authority, of every Rank, or We are undone. In a popular Gov 
ernment, this is the only Way of supporting order, and in our Cir 
cumstances, as our People have been so long without any Gov 
ernment att all, it is more necessary than in any other. The 
United Provinces were so sensible of this that they carried it to a 
burlesque Extream. 

I hope your Election in May will be the most solemn and joyfull 
that ever took Place in the Province. I hope every Body will 
attend. Clergy and Laity should go to Boston, every Body should 
be gratefully pious and happy. It should be conducted with a 
solemnity that may make an Impression on the whole People.

ABIGAIL ADAMS TO MERCY WARREN 

BRAINTREE, April 27, 1776 

I set myself down to comply with my Friend s request who I 
think seems rather low spiritted. 

I did write last week, but not meeting with an early conveyance 
I thought the Letter of but little importance and tossed it away. 
I acknowledg my Thanks due to my Friend for the entertainment 
she so kindly afforded me in the Characters drawn in her Last Let-

ter, and if coveting my Neighbour s Goods was not prohibited by 
the Sacred Law, I should be most certainly tempted to envy her 
the happy talent she possesses above the rest of her Sex, by adorn 
ing with her pen even trivial occurances, as well as Dignifying the 
most important. Cannot you communicate some of those Graces 
to your Friend and suffer her to pass them upon the World for her 
own, that she may feel a Little more upon an Equality with you? 
Tis true I often receive large packages from P[hiladelphi]a. They 
contain, as I said before, more Newspapers than Letters. Tho 
they are not forgotten, it would be hard indeed if absence had not 
some alleviations. 

I dare say he writes to no one unless to Portia oftener than to 
your Friend, because I know there is no one besides in whom he 
has an equal confidence. His Letters to me have been generally 
short; but he pleads in Excuse the critical State of Affairs and the 
Multiplicity of avocations and says further that he has been very 
Busy, and writ near ten sheets of paper about some affairs which 
he does not chuse to Mention for fear of accident. He is very 
saucy to me in return for a List of Female Grievances which I 
transmitted to him. 1 I think I will get you to join me in a petition 
to Congress. I thought it was very probable our wise Statesmen 
would erect a New Government and form a New Code of Laws. 
I ventured to speak a Word in behalf of our Sex who are rather 
hardly Dealt with by the Laws of England, which gives such un 
limited power to the Husband to use his Wife 111. I requested that 
our Legislators would consider our case, and as all Men of Deli 
cacy and Sentiment are averse to exercising the power they possess, 
yet as there is a Natural propensity in Humane Nature to domi 
nation, I thought the most Generous plan was to put it out of the 
power of the Arbitrary and tyrannick to injure us with impunity 
by establishing some Laws in our favour upon just and Liberal 
principals. 

I believe I even threatned fomenting a Rebellion in case we 
were not considerd, and assured him we would not hold ourselves 
bound by any Laws in which we had neither a voice nor represen 
tation. 

I Her letter of March 31, in Familiar Letters, 149.

In return he tells me he cannot but Laugh at my Extraordinary 
Code of Laws; that he had heard their Struggle had loosned the 
bonds of Government; that children and apprentices were diso 
bedient; that Schools and Colledges were grown turbulent; that 
Indians slighted their Guardians, and Negroes grew insolent to 
their Masters. But my Letter was the first intimation that an 
other Tribe more Numerous and powerfull than all the rest were 
grown discontented. This is rather too coarse a compliment, he 
adds, but that I am so sausy he won t blot it out. 

So I have helpd the Sex abundantly; but I will tell him I have 
only been making trial of the disinterestedness of his Virtue and 
when weighd in the balance have found it wanting. 

It would be bad policy to grant us greater power, say they, since 
under all the disadvantages we labour we have the assendancy 
over their" Hearts. 

And charm by accepting, by submitting sway. 1 

I wonder Apollo and the Muses could not have indulged me 
with a poetical Genious. I have always been a votary to her 
charms, but never could ascend Parnassus myself. I am very 
sorry to hear of the indisposition of your Friend. I am affraid it 
will hasten his return and I do not think he can be spaired. 

Though certain pains attend the cares of State 
A Good Man owes his Country to be great 
Should act abroad the high distinguishd part 
Or shew at least the purpose of his heart. 

Good Night, my Friend, you will be so good as to remember me

I should hardly have taken up my pen at this time to disturb your 
repose, or interrupt your business. Are you sensible how seldom 
you write to me, or does it proceed from choice or necessity? My 
writing at this time is merely to discharge a duty of friendship. 
I have scarcely a single thing to say that you don t already know. 
No sort of intelligence is stirring here. We are still drudging on 
at the General Court, much in the old way. Several bills are gone 
and on their way through the Court. A confession bill, a fee bill, 1 
a bill to alter the stile from King, etc., to Government and people 
of M. Bay, 2 Another for a test, 3 and some others of less impor 
tance. The attention of the Court has been fixed on fortifying the 
harbour and town of Boston. 4 We have in the beginning of the 
session chose a committee of both houses. All seem to be agreed 
in the importance of the measure, and to be very zealous in pursu 
ing it. But if you was told how little is yet effected, you would 
certainly be astonished. The committee has from time to time 
represented to us that General Ward could spare no men to go on 
Noddle s Island, etc. We have therefore ordered one regiment of 
728 men to be raised. This is not yet compleated, tho we are 
about it, and some few have come in. We have some thoughts of 
another regiment to fortify below; but if you send us a spirited 
general to succeed General Ward upon his resignation, the troops 
here may do it without. I hope therefore you will send us one 
that is active, and will dare to go into his works when constructed, 
and fight upon occasion. I don t insist on his being a native of this 
Colony. Rhode Island or New Hampshire will suit me as well. 
Fort Hill is, however, at last got into a tolerable posture of de 
fence, and the General has ordered some men to assist some we 
hire by the day at the Castle, and works are going on pretty well 
at Dorchester. No hulks are yet sunk: the people of Boston seem 
much against it; and whether it will be done or not I can t say.

We propose to rise this week. I hope we shall. I long to see my 
little farm, etc. I expect to hear from you before I leave this town 
on the subject of my last letter. Whoever is to command the 
army, or to pay them, I would call your attention to the good 
policy as well as justice of having some little money beforehand. 
When the payment of the militia that last reinforced the army is 
compleated, there will be little or nothing left; and the regiments 
here have been paid only for the month of February, though the 
General engaged to pay them monthly. This shortness of money 
has very much injured the service. The manufacture of salt petre 
continues to flourish abundantly; our powder makers find some 
difficulty in graining it. Some arrivals of powder and arms. A 
vessel belonging toNewbury is into Kennebeck with ten tons pow 
der, ten tons sulphur, some cannon, etc. Mr. Gerry s brigantine 
at Bilboa, was there five weeks ago, the powder landed and safe. 
Her business was betrayed by a villain who was second mate. She 
was stopped by the Consul, and the merchant intends shipping 
the powder on other bottoms. My regards to all friends, especially 
Mr. Adams and Gerry. I am your sincere friend, etc. 

We looked for a declaration of independence, and behold, an 
indulgence to drink tea. 

Since writing the inclosed I have received a confirmation of the 
vessels being in to Kennebeck, and inclose an extract of a letter 
from the Master to Mr. Greenleaf, by which we may at least 
learn that they mean to exert all their power and malice this 
summer. . . . 

This minute we are advised that two ships have joined that one 
in Nantasket road; from them are re-landed a number of men on 
George s Island, who are fortifying it. From this I am convinced 
they have not taken their leave of Boston. We have not men 
enough left here, and we must have a good officer to command, 
or men will signify nothing. So many of ours are gone into the 
army, that we find the regiment we have ordered raises slowly. 
Mr. Read has resigned. . . .

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
WATERTOWN, May 8, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, Since my last we have the formidable ac 
counts of the exertion of the powers and malice of Britain, which I 
suppose have reached you by this time, or will tomorrow. It is 
reported here that the Fleet and army are arrived at Halifax and 
are determined to attack this Colony again. This is confirmed by 
some deserters from the ship below, who say that they have heard 
the officers talk of their expectation of the fleet here. All serves 
only to confirm me in the sentiment I have ever had, that they 
would return here. Could it ever be supposed that any good policy 
would ever operate so strongly as revenge and the national pride, 
or rather the pride of the ministry, army, etc. I Would the loss of 
10,000 men be of any consequence compared with a chance of re 
pairing the disgrace suffered here? If I am right, and they come 
again, we are certainly in a miserable situation to receive them. 
Our men and arms gone to the southward, and our militia yet in a 
broken state. We should certainly have more of the Continental 
forces here and an officer of spirit to command them, or they will 
signify nothing. We are going on pretty well with the fortifica 
tions of Boston. The works at the Castle, Dorchester, Noddles 
Island, etc. are in good forwardness, and will soon be able to make 
a defence. We have ordered Hulks to be sunk, fire ships to be pre 
pared, and two row gallies to be built. We do all we can with 
little or no assistance from the Continent. Is not Boston and this 
Colony of as much consequence as New York? Upon my word I 
think they are, and at least as much exposed. You must not be 
surprised if, after all our warning and care, you should hear some 
of the most considerable towns are destroyed, and the country 
ravaged before we shall be able to stop them. The continental 
army have got our tents, our arms, our men, our ammunition and 
cannon. We are in a worse situation than twelve months ago, but 
I will say no more on this subject, only that we have ordered an 
other regiment to be raised of which Marshal x has the command,

and a regiment consisting of seven companies of artillery to be 
commanded by T. Crafts, as lieutenant colonel, and Trott, as 
Major. I wish things had been more agreeable to you with regard 
to certain appointments in a certain Court, but they are going 
from bad to worse. So barren is our poor country that they have 
been obliged to appoint the most unsuitable man in the world. 1 He 
had no suspicion of it before hand. He reasonably supposed that 
many blockheads might be hit on before it came to his turn; he 
had therefore no opportunity to prevent it. He is therefore em 
barrassed beyond measure. He fears your displeasure; he is puz 
zled with the solicitations of friends, or those who would get clear 
of this matter; but his conscience tells him he will by accepting 
injure his country and expose himself. He must therefore decline, 
and you must excuse his conduct upon those principles. Nothing 
is yet done about the tenure of commissions, etc. You must there 
fore lie at the mercy of , 2 etc. But the major says things 

shall be set right. I thank you for the pamphlet. I like it very 
well in general. I am not certain I should agree with the author 
in three branches of the Legislature. I am at present inclined to 
think two properly formed may do as well. 

I last Saturday evening received from the President your re 
solve accepting my resignation. This may be ranked among the 
minutiae, but it seems to me a little hurried and huddled, no 
determination what is to be done with the money in my hand. 
I have 40,000 dollars here which are wanted, but I have no author 
ity to act till somebody supplies this place. Surely it must be 
supplied. I am glad to see the spirit in the southern governments. 
I am afraid they will all get the start of Congress in declarations 
of Independence. We are certainly unanimously ripe here for the 
grand revolution. I have tried to get instructions for you, but 
have been so sick for three weeks past, as not to be fit for executing 
anything, and the Major thinks we had better have the instructions 
of our towns for that, and the purpose of assuming government. 
We rise today or tomorrow, and are to have a full representation. 
As the law stood thirty freeholders and inhabitants were to send

one, and one hundred and twenty, two members. Being threat- 
ned to be overrun from the frontiers, the county of Essex stirred 
themselves and sent a petition well supported for a more equal 
representation. This produced a new act by which every two 
hundred and twenty may send three; three hundred and twenty, 
four, and so on. 1 So we are to have a house full. 

I have just received yours of the 22d. The weather is so bad, 
that I keep house this afternoon. I sent it to the Major to read. 
I hope something will yet be done. I improve your letters to do a 
great deal of good. I have spoke for a copy of the report you men 
tion and engaged, a plan of the harbour of Boston. If I am not 
disappointed, you will find them enclosed. Your letters hold up 
to view many important matters, and never fail to please me. I am 
entirely of your sentiments with regard to the advantages of some 
measures, and disadvantages of others; but time will only permit 
me to inform you that the only news we have is, that Captain 
Tucker, in the schooner Manly used to command, yesterday took 
two brigantines, one from Ireland with provisions and goods, and 
the other from Fial with wine, and got them safe into Lyn. One 
of them he took close by the light house, while the man-of-war 
fired at him. While I am writing, there is a firing of cannon below. 
What that is I know not. Perhaps I may give you more news in 
the morning. . . . 

I am not fond of English or French tyranny, tho if I must have 
one, I should prefer the last. I don t want a French army here, 
but I want to have one employed against Britain, and I doubt 
whether that will ever be done, till you make a more explicit 
declaration of independence than is in your privateering resolves, 
or those for opening the ports. You will never be thought in ear 
nest, and fully determined yourselves, and to be depended on by 
others, till you go further. 

Mr. Bowdoin has carried away some days ago the resolves and 
plan, and has disappointed you by not returning it.

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

May 12, 1776 

MY DEAR FRIEND, Yours of April 30 was handed me yester 
day. My Writing so seldom to you proceeds from Necessity not 
Choice, I assure you. I can sympathize with you in your ill Health, 
because I am always unwell myself frail as I am, at best, I am 
feebler in this Climate than at home. The air here has no Spring, 
and My Mind is overborne with Burdens. Many Things are to 
be done here and many more to think upon by day and by night. 
Cares come from Boston, from Canada, from twelve other Colo 
nies, from innumerable Indian Tribes, from all Parts of Europe 
and the West Indies. Cares arise in this City, and in the most 
illustrious Assembly; and Cares Spring from Colleagues Cares 
enough! Don t you pity me? it would be some Comfort to be 
pitied; but I will scatter them all Avaunt ye Demons! 

An Address to the Convention of Virginia 1 has been published 
here as an Antidote to the popular Poison in Thoughts on Govern 
ment. Read it and see the Difference of Sentiment. In New 
England, the Thoughts on Government will be disdained because 
they are not popular enough; in the Southern Colonies, they will 
be despised and desulted 2 because too popular. 

But my Friend, between you and me, there is one Point, that 
I cannot give up. You must establish your Judges Salaries as 
well as Commissions, otherwise Justice will be a Proteus. Your 
Liberties, Lives and Fortunes will be the Sport of Winds. 

I don t expect, nor indeed desire that it should be attempted 
to give the Governor a Negative, in our Colony; make him 
President with a casting Voice. Let the Militia Act remain as it 
is. 3 But I hope you will make a Governor or President in May. 
Congress have passed a Vote with remarkable Unanimity for 
assuming Government in all the Colonies, which remains only for 
a Preamble; 4 you will see it in a few days. It is the Fate of Men and

Things which do great good that they always do great Evil too. 
"Common sense," by his crude ignorant Notion of a Government 
by one Assembly, will do more Mischief, in dividing the Friends of 
Liberty, than all the Tory Writings together. He is a keen Writer 
but very ignorant of the Science of Government. I see a Writer 
in one of your Papers, who proposes to make an Hotch Potch of 
the Council and House. If this is attempted, farewell. Who will 
be your Governor or President Bowdoin or Winthrop or War 
ren? Don t divide. Let the Choice be unanimous, I beg. If you 
divide you will Split the Province with Factions. For God s Sake 
Caucass it, before Hand, and agree unanimously to push for the 
same Man. Bowdoin s splendid fortune would be a great Advan 
tage at the Beginning. How are his Nerves and his Heart? If they 
will do, his Head and Fortune ought to decide in his favour. 

The Office of Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Surrounded 
as it will be with Difficulties, Perplexities and Dangers of every 
Kind, and on every Side, will require the clearest and coolest Head 
and the firmest Steadyest Heart, the most immoveable Temper 
and the profoundest Judgment, which you can find any where in 
the Province. He ought to have a Fortune too, and extensive 
Connections. I hope that Mr. Bowdoins Health is such, that he 
will do. If not you must dispense with Fortune, and fix upon 
Winthrop, I think. I know not where to go, for a better unless 
the Major General for the old Colony 1 can be agreed on with equal 
Unanimity, whom I should prefer to both of the other, provided 
an equal Number would agree to it. For I confess, my Rule should 
be to vote for the Man upon whom the Majority run, that the 
Choice might be as unanimous and respectable as possible. I 
dread the Consequences of Electing Governors, and would avoid 
every Appearance of and Tendency towards Party and Division, 
as the greatest Evil. 

I have sent down a Resignation of my Seat at the Board, be 
cause this is not a Time if ever there was or can be one for Sine 
cures. Fill up every Place they ought to be full. I believe I 

i Warren himself. On May 8 the House of Representatives had chosen three Major

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHI LAD A., May 12, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, I had the pleasure of receiving your very 
friendly Letter of the 2d Instant by a Mr. Park. I can readily 
excuse your not writing to me so often as I wish to receive your 
Letters, when I consider how much you are engaged in the publick 
Affairs; and so you must be, while your Life is spared to your 
Country. 

I am exceedingly concernd to find by your Letter, as well as 
those of my other Friends, that so little Attention has been given 
tc an Affair of such weight, as the fortifying the Harbour of Boston. 
To what can this be attributed? Is it not wise to prevent the 
Enemies making Use of every Avenue, especially those which lead 
into the Capital of our Country? -I hope that no little party 
Animosities can ever exist much less prevail in our Councils to 
obstruct so necessary a Measure. Such Contentions you well 
remember, that Fiend Hutchinson and his Confederates made it 
their constant Study to stir up between the Friends of the Colony 
in different parts of it in order to prevent their joynt Exertions for 
the Common Good. Let us with great Care avoid such Snares as 
our Enemies have heretofore laid for our Ruin, and which we have 
found by former Experience have proved too successful to their 
wicked purposes.J This will, I think, be an important Summer. I 
confide therefore in the Wisdom of our Colony; and that they will 
lay aside the Consideration of smaller Matters for the present, 
and bend their whole Attention to the necessary Means for the 
Common Safety. I hope the late Scituation of Boston since the 
Enemy left it is by this time very much altered for the better. 
If not, it must needs be a strong Inducement to them to re-enter 
it, and whether we ought not by all means in our power to endeavor 
to prevent this, I will leave to you and others to judge.

Yesterday the Congress resolvd into a Committee of the whole, 
to take under Consideration the Report of a former Committee, 
appointed to consider the state of the Eastern District, which 
comprehends New England. It was then agreed that the Troops 
in Boston should be augmented to 6000. The Question now lies 
before Congress and will be considered tomorrow. I am inclind 
to think the Vote will obtain. 1 But what will avail the ordering 
additional Battalions if men will not inlist? Do our Countrymen 
want Animation at a Time when all is at Stake ! Your Presses have 
too long been silent. What are your Committees of Correspond 
ence about? I hear Nothing of Circular Letters, oijoynt Committees, 
etc., etc. 

Such Methods have in times passd raisd the Spirits of the 
People, drawn off their Attention from picking up pins, and 
directed their Views to great objects. But not having had timely 
Notice of the Return of this Express, I must conclude, (earnestly 
praying for the Recovery of your Health). Very affectionately your

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

May 15, 1776 

This Day the Congress has passed the most important Resolu 
tion that ever was taken in America. 
It is as nearly as I can repeat it from Memory, in these Words. 

Whereas his Britannic Majesty, in Conjunction with the Lords and 
Commons of Great Britain, has, by a late Act of Parliament, excluded 
the Inhabitants of these united Colonies from the Protection of his 
Crown; and Whereas No answer whatever has been given or is likely to 
be given, to the humble Petitions of the Colonies for Redress of their 
Grievances and Reconciliation with Great Britain; but on the Contrary, 
the whole Force of the Kingdom, aided by foreign Mercenaries, is to be 
exerted for our Destruction and Whereas it is irreconcileable to Reason 

I The resolution as adopted, May 14, is in Journals of the Continental Congress, iv. 355. 



246 Warren- Adams Letters [1776 

and good Conscience, for the People of these Colonies to take the Oaths 
and Affirmations necessary for the Support of any Government under 
the Crown of Great Britain and it is necessary that the Exercise of every 
Kind of Authority under the said Crown should be totally Suppressed, 
and all the Powers of Government under the Authority of the People of 
the Colonies exerted for the Preservation of internal Peace, Virtue and 
good order, as well as to defend our Lives, Liberties and Properties, from 
the hostile Invasions and cruel Depredations of our Enemies, therefore 
Resolved that it be recommended to the several Assemblies and 
Conventions to institute such Forms of Government as to them shall 
appear necessary, to promote the Happiness of the People. 1 

This Preamble and Resolution are ordered to be printed and 
you will see them immediately in all the News Papers upon the 
Continent. 

I shall make Tio Comments, upon this important and decisive 
Resolution. 

There remains, however, a great deal of Work to be done besides 
the Defence of the Country. A Confederation must be now pur 
sued with all the Address, Assiduity Prudence, Caution, and yet 
Fortitude and Perseverance, which those who think it necessary 
are possessed of. It is the most intricate, the most important, the 
most dangerous and delicate Business of all. It will require Time, 
We must be patient. Two or three days We have spent in Consid 
ering the state of the Massachusetts Bay. Congress have at last 
voted that the Five Battallions now in that Province be recruited 
to their full Complements and that three Battallions more be 
forthwith raised. 2 The Province has raised one, lately as I am 
informed. You will have nothing to do, but return the Names of 
the Field Officers to Congress and have continental Commissions 
for them. The other two Battallions may be raised in Mass. Bay, 
Connecticutt and New Hampshire, in what Proportions is not 
determined. Congress have voted that a Major General and a 
Brigadier General be sent to Boston. 3 Who they will be I know 
not Gates and Mifflin, I hope, but cant promise. 4

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

May 1 8, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, Yours of 8 May received this Morning, and 
am, as I ever have been, much of your Opinion that the Enemy 
would return to the Massachusetts if possible. They will probably 
land at Hingham or Braintree, or somewhere to the Northward of 
Boston, not make a direct Attempt upon Boston itself, the next 
Time. I hope no Pains, no Labour or expense will be neglected to 
fortify the Harbour of Boston however. 

Your Militia you say is in a broken state, but don t explain what 
you mean. I was in hopes that the late Militia Law had put them 
in a good Condition. You must depend upon them chiefly. We 
have been labouring here to procure you Some Assistance, and have 
obtained a Vote, that the 5 Battallions now with you be filled up, 
and three Additional ones raised, two in Mass, one in Connecti- 
cutt. 1 A Major General and Brigadier are to go to Boston. You 
must not hesitate at any Thing for your own Defence. New York 
and Canada will take an infinite Expense. We did our best, but 
could procure no more at present. If an Impression should be 
made on you, the Continent will interpose; but they never will 
believe it untill it takes Place. 

This Day has brought us the Dismals from Canada De 
feated most ignominiously. 2 Where shall we lay the blame? 
America, duped and bubbled with the Phantom of Commissioners, 
has been fast asleep, and left that important Post undefended, 
unsupported. 

The Ministry have caught the Colonies, as I have often caught a 
Horse, by holding out an empty Hat, as if it was full of Corn, or 
as many a Sportsman has shot Woodcocks, by making an old 
Horse Stalk before him, and hide him from the Sight of the Bird.

Nothing has ever put my Patience to the Tryal so much as to see 
Knaves imposing upon Fools, by such Artifices. I wash my Hands 
of this Guilt. I have reasoned, I have ridiculed, I have fretted and 
declaimed against this fatal Delusion, from the Beginning. 

But a Torrent is not to be impeded by Reasoning, nor a Storm 
allayed by Ridicule. In my situation, altho I have not and will 
not be restrained from a Freedom of Speech yet a Decorum must 
be observed, and ever has been by me. But I have often wished 
that all America knew as much as I do of the Springs of Action 
and the Motions of the Machine. I do not think it prudent, nor 
Safe, to write freely upon these Subjects even to my most faithfull 
Friends. 

Providence has hitherto preserved us, and I firmly believe will 
continue to do so. But it gives me inexpressible Grief that by our 
own Folly and Wickedness We should deserve it so very ill as We 
do. 

What shall We say of this scandalous Flight from Quebec? It 
seems to be fated that New England officers should not support a 
Character. Wooster is the Object now of Contempt and Detesta 
tion of those who ought to be the Contempt and Detestation of 
all America for their indefatigable Obstruction to every Measure 
which has been meditated for the Support of our Power in Canada. 
Our Province must find some Way of making better Officers and 
of engaging abler Men in her Councils as well as her Arms, or I 
know not what will be the Consequence. Instead of which she 
Seems to me to be contriving Means to drive every Man of real 
Abilities out of her service. 

I hope you will not decline the Appointment you mention, how 
ever. Nothing would make me so happy as your Acceptance of 
that Place. I am extreamly unhappy to hear of your ill Health; 
hope that will mend. There i"S certainly no Man in the Province 
who would be so agreable to me. I cant bear the Thought of your 
refusing. 

Rejoice to hear that my Friends, Crafts and Trott, are in the 
service. Will it do to promote my Pupil Austin? 1 His Genius is 

I Jonathan Williams Austin, now a major. He was "dishonorably discharged" from the 
service November 13, 1776, and had not been promoted. 



1 776] Warren-Adams Letters 249 

equal to any Thing. Would not promotion mend him of his 
Faults? Can nothing be done for Ward, 1 Aid de Camp and Secre 
tary to General Ward? He is an honest, faithfull daring Man, I 
think, and sensible enough. He really deserves Promotion. 

Is it possible to get in Boston Silver and Gold for the service in 
Canada? Our Affairs have been ruined there for Want of it and 
can never be retrieved without it. Pray let me know if any sum 
can be had in our Province. 

I shall inclose you a News Paper, which when you have read 
send along to Braintree. 

I am, and have been these twelve Months, fully of your Opinion 
that we have nothing to depend upon for our Preservation from 
Destruction, but the kind Assistance of Heaven to our own Union 
and vigorous Exertions. I was ripe therefore for as explicit 
Declarations as Language could express Twelve Months ago; but 
the Colonies seperately have neglected their Duty as much as the 
Congress, and We cannot march faster than our Constituents will 
follow Us. We dont always go quick enough to keep out of their 
Way. 



JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN

MY DEAR SIR, Every Post and every Day rolls in upon Us. 
Independence like a Torrent. The Delegates from Georgia made 
their Appearance this Day in Congress with unlimited Powers 
and these Gentlemen themselves are very firm. 2 South Carolina, 
has erected her Government and given her Delegates ample Pow 
ers, and they are firm enough. North Carolina have given theirs 
full Powers, after repealing an Instruction given last August 
against Confederation and Independence. This Days Post, has 
brought a Multitude of Letters from Virginia, all of which breath 
the same Spirit. They agree they shall institute a Government - 
all are agreed in this they say. Here are four Colonies to the 

1 Joseph Ward. He became Commissary General of Musters in 1777. 

2 Lyman Hall (1725-1790) and Button Gwinnett (c. 1732-1777). Their " powers " are 
printed in Journals of Continental Congress, iv. 367. 



2 5 Warren- Adams Letters [1776 

Southward who are perfectly agreed now with the four to the 
Northward. Five in the Middle are not yet quite so ripe; but they 
are very near it. I expect that New York will come to a fresh 
Election of Delegates in the Course of this Week, give them full 
Powers, and determine to institute a Government. 

The Convention of New Jersey, is about Meeting and will as 
sume a Government. 

Pennsylvania Assembly meets this Day and it is said will repeal 
their Instruction to their Delegates which has made them so ex 
ceedingly obnoxious to America in General, and their own Con 
stituents in particular. 

We have had an entertaining Maneuvre this Morning in the 
State House Yard. The Committee of the City summoned a Meet 
ing at Nine O Clock in the State House Yard to consider of the 
Resolve of Congress of the fifteenth instant. The Weather was 
very rainy, and the Meeting was in the open air like the Comitia of 
the Romans, a Stage was erected, extempore for the Moderator, 
and the few orators to ascend Coll. Roberdeau 1 was the Mod 
erator; Coll. McKean, 2 Coll. Cadwallader 3 and Coll. Matlack 4 
the principal orators. It was the very first Town Meeting I ever 
saw in Philadelphia and it was conducted with great order, De 
cency and Propriety. 

The first step taken was this: the Moderator produced the Re 
solve of Congress of the I5th inst. and read it with a loud sten 
torian Voice that might be heard a Quarter of a Mile. "Whereas 
his Britannic Majesty, etc." As soon as this was read, the Multi 
tude, several Thousands, some say, tho so wett rended the Welkin 
with three Cheers, Hatts flying as usual, etc. 

Then a Number of Resolutions were, produced, and moved, 
and determined with great Unanimity. These Resolutions I will 
send you as soon as published. The Drift of the whole was 
that the Assembly was not a Body properly constituted, author 
ized, and qualified to carry the Resolve for instituting a new 
Government into Execution and therefore that a Convention 
should be called. And at last they voted to support and defend 

I Daniel Roberdeau (1727-1795). 2 Thomas McKean (1734-1817). 

3 John Cadwalader (1742-1786). 4 Timothy Matlack (1730-1829). 



1776] Warren- Adams Letters 251 

the Measure of a Convention, at the Utmost Hazard and at all 
Events, etc. 

The Delaware Government, generally, is of the same Opinion 
with the best Americans, very orthodox in their Faith and very 
exemplary in their Practice. Maryland remains to be mentioned. 
That is so eccentric a Colony sometimes so hot, sometimes so 
cold ; now so high, then so low that I know not what to say about 
it or to expect from it. I have often wished it could exchange 
Places with Hallifax. When they get agoing I expect some wild 
extravagant Flight or other from it. To be sure they must go 
beyond every body else when they begin to go. 

Thus I have rambled through the Continent, and you will per 
ceive by this state of it, that We can t be very remote from the 
most decisive Measures and the most critical events. What do you 
think must be my Sensations when I see the Congress now daily 
passing Resolutions, which I most earnestly pressed for against 
Wind and Tide Twelve Months ago? and which I have not omitted 
to labour for a Month together from that Time to this? What do 
you think must be my Reflections, when I see the Farmer J him 
self now confessing the Falsehood of all his Prophecies, and the 
Truth of mine, and confessing himself, now for instituting Govern 
ments, forming a Continental Constitution, making Alliances, 
with foreigners, opening Ports and all that and confessing that 
the defence of the Colonies, and Preparations for defence have been 
neglected, in Consequence of fond delusive hopes and deceitfull 
Expectations ? 

I assure you this is no Gratification of my Vanity. 

The gloomy Prospect of Carnage and Devastation that now pre 
sents itself in every Part of the Continent, and which has been in 
the most express and decisive nay dogmatical Terms foretold by 
me a thousand Times, is too affecting to give me Pleasure. It 
moves my keenest Indignation. Yet I dare not hint at these 
Things for I hate to give Pain to Gentlemen whom I believe 
sufficiently punished by their own Reflections.

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
WATERTOWN, June 2, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, I received yours of the 2oth of May with the 
pamphlets inclosed. I am much obliged to you for them. I am 
quite satisfied that you have wrote to me as often as your situa 
tion would admit of, that your cares are great and press on you 
from many quarters. I never suspected your friendship. I pity you 
as much as you can wish a friend to do, and admire your spirit and 
resolute perseverance in the publick cause. I have read and see 
the difference of sentiment in the two pamphlets. The Thoughts 
on Government are far from being disdained in New England. 
They were admired here. Very few exceptions are made by any 
body; the only one of any consequence that I have heard is that 
the author seems rather inclined to a negative in the third branch, 
which is hardly popular enough for our climate, poor and sterile as 
it is. I believe the author never expected it would comport with 
the Monarchick and aristocratic spirit of the South. Whether it is 
best there should be a perfect similarity in the form and spirit 
of the several governments in the colonies, provided they are all 
independant of Britain, is a question I am not determined on. 
For some reasons it may be best for us there should be a difference. 
I therefore consider the address to the Convention of Virginia 
with the more indifference, as it may (if successful) neither injure 
the publick or us. 

I regretted my not being able to write by Mr. Winthrop, who 
left this place two days ago. You will have by him a list of our new 
House, and I suppose a list of the Council chosen, as he promised 
me not to go without it. Colonel Orne and Danielson x refused. 
We chose Eldad Taylor and Colonel Thayer 2 in their room. You 
will find in the House more abilities, tho perhaps not more zeal 
for the present system of politicks than in the last, and you will 
see in the list of councillors some that I did not vote for. We have 
had yet nothing before us to determine what we are to expect 
from the conduct of this new House. The election took us two 
entire days, and controverted elections filled up the rest of the 

I Azor Orne and Timothy Danielson. 2 Ebenezer Thayer, junior. 



1776] Warren-Adams Letters 253 

last week. We yesterday sent home the Salem members for the 
irregularity of the proceedings of the town in their choice. 1 Colonel 
Palmer is again in the House, I dare say you are informed how. 

I presume as we are now at liberty to establish a form of gov 
ernment, we shall soon take up that matter. I shall do everything 
in my power to promote unanimity in the choice of a Governor or 
President, let the general voice be as it may. I thank you for your 
partiality. I could pitch on a much more suitable person than 
either of the three you mention, by going as far as Philadelphia, 
tho what we should do without him there I can t tell. Tis our mis 
fortune that the same men can t be in two places at the same time. 
I shall write you as soon as any thing on this subject takes place. 
The piece you mention published in our papers is in total oblivion; 
so desire you not to take your leave of us. I shall do everything in 
my power to have the salaries and commissions of the judges es 
tablished. I have long been convinced of the necessity of it, and 
I am sure we can do nothing more advantageous to our internal 
police. The nerves of one of the gentlemen you mention are weak, 
owing perhaps to his state of health. His heart, I believe, is good, 
tho not so decisively zealous as I could wish, perhaps owing to his 
splendid fortune. His head is undoubtedly good. 

We have no news, frequent rumours of battles and victories in 
Canada since our late misfortune there, but nothing to be de 
pended on. I am mortified by the little zeal and readiness shewn 
by our country men to enter into the service. Neither Marshal s, 
Whitney s or Craft s regiments are yet half full. What hopes can 
we entertain that the five old battalions left here will be filled up, 
or the two new ones raised. Can you advise as to give them a 
bounty by way of encouragement, or should you disapprove of 
it? It certainly would be very advantageous to us to have them, 
and our delegates deserve our thanks for their exertions on this 
occasion. But how to get them is the question. I suppose it would 
not do to have the two regiments we are now raising converted 

I "It being represented to the House, that at the election of the gentlemen returned 
from Salem, the electors voted by kernels of corn and pease. It was moved that the sense 
of the House be taken, whether their election was made agreeable to law, and the question 
being put, it passed in the negative." Journals of the House of Representatives (Mass.), 1776, 



254 Warren- Adams Letters [1776 

into Continental regiments. I can t account for the difficulties we 
have in raising men. Great numbers are indeed gone from us, and 
the southern governments have agents here inlisting seamen for 
their particular services, with full wages and large bounties. I 
fear therefore you will find it difficult to man your ships. You 
should attend to it without delay. 

We have a promising season, fine showers, the crops look flour 
ishing, tho the weather has been cooler than usual. Mr. Winthrop 
has with him my accounts. I expect there will be some small de 
ficiency, owing to the multiplicity of business in that office, and 
the hurry and crowd we have been obliged to do it in. I have 
directed him to charge for a clerk, as it was impossible to execute 
it without one, and to charge the expences of going to Philadelphia 
to settle account, as I am out of pay. I hope all these will be al 
lowed me. The army here are in distress for want of money. I 
have run the venture at the solicitations of General Ward to pay 
several sums since I had notice that my resignation was accepted. 
I hope the publick advantage and the General s solicitations will 
justify my conduct. I have desired Mr. Winthrop to call on you 
for any assistance he may have occasion for. I know you will give 
it to him, and I tho t I need make no apology for the freedom. . . . 

I never yet congratulated you on the almost miraculous inter 
position of Providence in sending us the prize ship carried into 
Boston. I do it now. The gallant defence made by our small ves 
sels against the men of war boats is perhaps as noble a one as any 
this war. I can t give you an exact account of the loss on their 
side, but I believe in killed and wounded little short of a hundred. 
. . . You must not think of a resignation; we shall be ruined if you 
do. 



JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 

WATER-TOWN, June 5th, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, The inclosed letter was sealed to go by the 
last Post, but I unluckily missed it I have now an opportunity to 
inclose one from Braintree. Doctor Church is arrived here. Is 



1776] W^arren- Adams Letters 255 

not your resolve relative to him somewhat extraordinary? I fear 
the People will kill him if at large. The night before last he went 
to lodge at Waltham, was saved by the interposition of the select 
men but by jumping out of a chamber window and flying. His life 
is of no great consequence, but such a step has a tendency to lessen 
the confidence of the people in the doings of Congress. 

A large Sugar Ship from Jamaica with 300 hhds. sugar, 80 pun 
cheons rum, some Madeira wine, etc., etc., is taken and got into 
the vineyard in her way to Bedford. It is said that four or five 
others are taken by two Privateers who took this. What Priva 
teers they are I cant learn. 

Must not something be done to prevent British Property being 
covered by the West Indians? We shall loose our Labour, and dis 
courage our Seamen. Why should not all English property going 
to Britain be liable to capture? this matter must be considered. 
We should fight them on equal terms. We have a number of Sea 
men here supported at your expence. If your Generosity and Civ 
ilized Sentiments prevent, won t good policy dictate recourse to 
the Lex talionis ? They are wanted, you will find the want of 
them when you man your ships.

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADA., June 6, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, I have for some time past been expecting to 
visit my Friends in New England which has made me the less 
sollicitous of writing to them, but Business of the most interesting 
Importance has hitherto detaind me here. Our Affairs in Canada 
have of late worn a displeasing Aspect, but Measures have been 
adopted which I trust will repair Misfortunes and set Matters 
right in that Quarter. This will, in my Opinion, be an important 
Summer, productive of great Events which we must be prepard to 
meet. If America is virtuous She will vanquish her Enemies and 
establish her Liberty. You know my Temper. Perhaps I may be 
too impatient. I have long wishd for the Determination of some 
momentous Questions. If Delay shall prove mischeivous I shall 



256 W^arren- Adams Letters [1776 

have no Reason to reflect upon myself; Every one here knows 
what my Sentiments have been. However, tomorrow a Motion 
will be made, 1 and a Question I hope decided, the most important 
that was ever agitated in America. I have no doubt but it will be 
decided to your satisfaction. This being done, Things will go on 
in the right Channel and our Country will be saved. The Bearer 

waits. Adieu. 

S. A. 

Let me intreat you, my Friend, to exert your Influence to pre 
vent unnecessary Questions in the Assembly which may cause 
Contention. 2 Now if ever Union is necessary Innovations may 
well enough be put off, till publick Safety is secured. 

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

June 9, 1776 

I shall address this to you as Speaker, but you may be Coun 
cillor, or Governor, or Judge, or any other Thing, or nothing but a 
good Man, for what I know. Such is the Mutability of this World. 

Upon my Word I think you use the World very ill to publish and 
send abroad a Newspaper since the 29 May without telling Us one 
Word about the Election, where it was held, who preached the 
sermon, 3 or etc., etc. I write this in haste only to inclose to you a 
little Treatise upon Fire Ships. It may be sending Coals to New 
Castle, but it appears to me of such Importance that I thought 
myself bound to procure and send it, least this Art should not be 
understood among you. This Art carries Terror and Dismay along 
with it, and the very Rumour of Preparations in this Kind may do 
you more service than many Battalions. 4 

1 "Certain resolutions respecting independency being moved and seconded," etc. The 
resolutions are in Journals of the Continental Congress, v. 425. They are in the writing of 
Richard Henry Lee, and were seconded by John Adams. The endorsement on the original, 
printed in the Journals, gives an interesting glimpse of the proceedings of Congress upon 
the motion. 

2 Warren had been re-elected Speaker of the House. 

3 The sermon was preached by Rev. Samuel West, of Dartmouth, May 29, 1776. His 
text was Titus, in. i. 

4 This may refer to a MS. The only printed work of the kind was a translation by Ma 
jor Lewis Nicola of Chevalier de Clairac s L Engenieur de Campagne, to which was added 
"A short Treatise on Sea Batteries." It was issued by Robert Aitken, of Philadelphia, in 
1776. 



1776] Warren- Adams Letters 257 

I am not easy about Boston and have taken all the Pains in my 
Power with G. Washington, to engage him to send G[ates] and 
M[ifflin] there; but he is so sanguine and confident that no attempt 
will be made there, that I am afraid his security will occasion one.

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, June 16, 1776 

DEAR SIR, Your Favours of June 2d and 5th are now before 
me. The address to the Convention of Virginia makes but a small 
Fortune in the World. Coll. Henry in a Letter to me expresses an 
infinite Contempt of it, and assures me that the Constitution of 
Virginia will be more like the Thoughts on Government. 1 I believe, 
however, they will make the Election of their Council, Septennial. 
Those of Representatives to Governor annual. But I am amazed 
to find an Inclination so prevalent throughout all the southern and 
middle Colonies to adopt Plans, so nearly resembling, that in the 
Thoughts on Government. I assure you, untill the Experiment was 
made I had no adequate Conception of it. But the Pride of the 
haughty must I see come down, a little in the South. 

You suppose "it would not do to have the two Regiments you 
are now raising converted into continental Battallions." But why? 
Would the officers or Men have any objection? If they would not, 
Congress would have none. Indeed this was what I expected and 
intended when the Measure was in Agitation. Indeed I thought, 
that as our Battalions with their arms were carried to N. York 
and Canada in the Service of the United Colonies, the Town of 
Boston, and the Province ought to be guarded against Danger by 
the united Colonies. 

You have been since called upon for Six Thousand Militia for 
Canada and New York. How you will get the Men I know not. 
The Small Pox, I suppose will be a great Discouragement. 2 But

We must maintain our Ground in Canada. The Regulars, if they 
get full Possession of that Province, and the Navigation of St. 
Lawrence River above Dechambeault at least above Mouth of the 
Sorrell, will have nothing to interrupt their Communication with 
Niagara, Detroit, Michilimachinac; they will have the Navigation 
of the five great Lakes quite as far as the Mississippi River; they 
will have a free Communication with all the numerous Tribes of 
Indians, extending along the Frontiers of all the Colonies, and 
by their Trinketts and Bribes will induce them to take up the 
Hatchett, and spread Blood and Fire among the Inhabitants by 
which Means, all the Frontier Inhabitants will be driven in upon 
the middle Settlements, at a Time when the Inhabitants of the 
Seaports and Coasts, will be driven back by the British Navy. Is 
this Picture too high coloured? Perhaps it is; but surely We must 
maintain our Power, in Canada. 

You may depend upon my rendering Mr. Winthrop all the serv 
ice in my Power. 

I believe it will not be long before all Property belonging to 
British Subjects, Whether in Europe, the W. Indies, or elsewhere 
will be made liable to Capture. A few Weeks may possibly produce 
great Things. I am, etc.

PLYMOUTH, July loth, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, I have for some time past been at Home in 
daily expectation of the Court s riseing. It has however continued 
setting till this time. What they have lately been employed about 
I am not able to say I believe nothing very important. A very 
large Committee are out to raise the men, I mean the 5000 re 
quested by Congress for Canada and York. I hope they will by 
the large Encouragement of 7. for Canada, and 3. for York, 
with some additional Bounty from Individuals in the several 

carted into the Town. That ever prevailing Passion of following the Fashion is as Pre 
dominant at this time as ever. Men, Women and Children eagerly crowding to innoculate 
is, I think, as modish as running away from the Troops of a barbarous George was the last 
year." Hannah Winthro-p to Mercy Warren, July 8, 1776. MS.

towns, be soon raised, and sent forward. The Court have spent 
much more time about this business than was consistent with the 
exigency of the service. There was no objection to a compliance 
with the Requisition; but the manner of doing it, or rather the 
places from whence they should be taken have occasioned the 
delay. Indeed the Levies on particular Towns fall very heavy. 
A much greater proportion of our men are in service than Congress 
seems to be aware off. How we are to get the 1 500 now called for 
I can t tell, nor do I know how Congress will like the Bounties 
given already; but it was thought impossible to raise them without 
a large encouragement, especially at this season of the year. 

I had a few days ago the pleasure of your favour of the 9th June. 
I presume the Papers before this have informed you that I am in 
the same station you left me in, and I can inform you that I am 
in that only; and if it be my ne plus ultra, perhaps it can t be said 
of me as it may of some others that I have not my deserts. Calls 
for men and other matters of the same kind have hitherto pre 
vented our doing any thing about the matter of Government. Our 
Recess will be short, and if we are not pressed with such matters 
when we meet next I presume we shall go upon it. I congratulate 
you on the discovery of the plot at New York. I hope it will do 
great service. 1 I expect soon to hear of some great events from that 
quarter. If they should be favourable to us, what will they do 
next? We have but little news here. Now and then a prize from 
the West Indies is sent in. Last Saturday got into Cape Ann two 
prizes taken by a small Sloop belonging to four or five persons in 
and about Boston; one from Jamaica, a three decker, with 400 
hhds. sugar, 200 hhds. rum, 30 bales cotton, etc., etc.; the other 
from Antegua with 400 hhds. rum. This sloop could have taken 
another ship but had not men to bring her off, and so let her go. 
When are we to hear of your proceedings on the first Instant what 
Alliances, and Confederations have you agreed on? I want to see 
some French Men of War on the coast. Our borders seem to be in 
a state of peace and tranquility; how long they will continue so I

know not. The Small Pox prevails, and is scattered about the 
country. In Boston they have given up all thoughts of stopping it, 
and everybody is inoculating. I wrote to Mr. Gerry a few days 
ago, and among other things about some of my private affairs, in 
the paymaster s office. I desired him to communicate to you, so 
shan t trouble you with a repetition. I will thank you for your 
assistance. If I can t help myself I must loose this money, but it 
will be a hard case. I did great services to the Army in and out of 
this office, which I executed with diligence, oeconomy, and integ 
rity, and you will see this loss was sustained in Winthrop s hands. 
I have no reason to question his integrity. My regards to all

DEAR SIR, I have Time only to tell you that I am yet alive 
and in better Spirits than Health. 

The News you will learn from my very worthy Friend Gerry. 
He is obliged to take a Ride for his Health, as I shall be very soon, 
or have none. God grant he may recover it, for he is a Man of 
immense Worth. If every Man here was a Gerry, the Liberties of 
America would be safe against the Gates of Earth and Hell. 

We are in hourly Expectation of Sober Work at New York. 
May Heaven grant Us Victory, if We deserve it; if not Patience, 
Humility, and Pennitence under Defeat. However I feel pretty 
confident and Sanguine that We shall give as good an Account of 
them this Year as we did last.

1776] Warren- Adams Letters 261 



JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
BOSTON, July i/th, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, When you are informed that in the variety of 
changes that have taken place in this town, it is now become a 
Great Hospital for Inoculation, you will wonder to see a letter 
from me dated here; but so it is that the rage for inoculation pre 
vailing here has whirled me into its vortex, and brought me with 
my other self into the croud of patients with which this town is 
now filled. Here is a collection of good, bad, and indifferent of all 
orders, sexes, ages and conditions, your good Lady and Family 
among the first. She will give you (I presume) such an account of 
herself, etc., as makes it unnecessary for me to say more on that 
head. She will perhaps tell you that this is the reigning subject of 
conversation, and that even politics might have been suspended 
for a time, if your Declaration of Independence, and some other 
political movements of yours had not reached us. The Declaration 
came on Saturday, and diffused a general Joy. Every one of us 
feels more important than ever; we now congratulate each other 
as Freemen. It has really raised our spirits to a tone beneficial to 
mitigate the malignity of the small pox, and what is of more con 
sequence seems to animate and inspire every one to support and 
defend the Independency he feels. I shall congratulate you on the 
occasion and so leave this subject and go to one not quite so agre- 
able. Congress have acted a part with regard to this Colony, shall 
I say cunning, or politic, or only curious, or is it the effect of agita 
tion. Has the approach of Lord Howe had such an effect on the 
southern Colonies, that they have forgot the very Extensive Sea 
Coast we have to defend, the Armed Vessels we have to man from 
South Carolina to the northern limits of the United Colonies, that 
a large part of the Continental Army is made up from this Colony, 
that the General has not only got our men but our arms, and that 
they within two months ordered a reinforcement of three Bat- 
.talions to the five already here. Lucky for us you did not give 
time to raise these before your other requisitions reached us, or we 
should have been stripped indeed. Don t the Southern Colonies 
think this worth defending, or do they think with half our men 



262 Warren- Adams Letters [1776 

gone the remainder can defend it, with spears and darts, or with 
slings (as David slew Goliah). I was surprised to find the whole 
five Battalions called away. No determination as yet taken how 
their places shall be supplyed. The General Court are not setting, 
they were prorogued on Saturday; the Council have this matter 
under consideration. What can they do but call in the militia, or 
perhaps stop the last 1500 men called for to go to Canada if in 
their power. The works for the defence of this Town must not 
be abandoned; they must be defended with or without Conti 
nental assistance. Don t suppose that I am a preacher of sedi 
tion, or intend to be factious, or that the eruptive fever is now 
upon me. Neither of these is true. I shall suppress all sentiments 
of uneasiness but to you and some few who I have reason to 
suppose think of these matters in the same way, and determine 
to do and suffer any and every thing for the good of the whole; 
but I think, tho the Grand Object will be York and Canada, 
and their principal Force there, we are not so safe as we ought 
to be. 

I can give you little or no news. Two of our vessels have been 
brought too by a Man of War at sea, and the masters taken as they 
were told before Lord Howe, who told them he was bound directly 
to Philadelphia to settle with the Congress the unhappy dispute. 
He dismissed both the vessels and gave them paper to protect 
them against any or all cruizers, haveing first reprimanded one of 
them for the violation of Acts of Parliament in the illicit trade at 
St. Petres, from which place he then came with French commodi 
ties. Our coast is clear. I hear of no Cruisers at present to inter 
rupt the passage of vessels. Last Saturday was the first time I 
have been in this Town since the flight of the Invincible British 
Troops. I can t describe the alteration and the gloomy appearance 
of this Town. No Business, no Busy Faces but those of the Physi 
cians. Ruins of buildings, wharfs, etc., etc., wherever you go, and 
the streets covered with grass. I have just heard that an honest 
man from St. Petres in twenty-five days says they had there intelr 
ligence of a declaration of War between Spain and Portugal. This 
is neither impossible or improbable, and may account for Lord 
Howe s being in a single ship, as we are told he had arrived at the 



1776] Warren- Adams Letters 263 

Hook. I wish you all happiness and am with regards to Mrs. 
Adams and Gerry, Yours etc.,

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, July 24, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, Yours of the loth instant came by Yesterday s 
Post. This I suppose will find you, at Boston, growing well of the 
Small Pox. This Distemper is the King of Terrors to America 
this year. We shall Suffer as much by it as We did last Year by 
the Scarcity of Powder. And therefore I could wish, that the whole 
People was innoculated. It gives me great Pleasure to learn that 
such Numbers have removed to Boston, for the sake of going 
through it, and that Innoculation is permitted in every Town. 
The plentifull Use of Mercury is a Discouragement to Many; But 
you will see by a Letter from Dr. Rush which I lately inclosed to 
my Partner that Mercury is by him wholly laid aside. He prac 
tices with as much Success and Reputation as any Man. 1 

I am much grieved and a little vexed at your Refusal of a Seat 
on a certain Bench. Is another appointed? Who is it? 

Before now you have the Result of our Proceedings the Begin 
ning of this Month. A Confederation will follow very soon and 
other mighty Matters. 

Our force is not Sufficient at New York. Have suffered much 
Pain, in looking over the Returns, to see no Massachusetts Militia 
at N. York. Send them along, for the Land s sake. Let Us drubb 
Howe, and then We shall do very well. Much depends upon that. 
I am not much concerned about Burgoine. He will not get over 
the Lakes this Year. If he does he will be worse off. 

I rejoice at the spread of the Small Pox, on another Account. 
Having had the Small Pox, was the Merit, which originally, recom 
mended me to this lofty Station. This Merit is now likely to be 

I In April, 1776, Dr. John Morgan wrote A Recommendation of Inoculation according to 
Baron Dimsdale s Method (Boston, J. Gill, 1776), intended to serve as an introduction to an 
issue of Dimsdale s Present Method of Inoculation for the Small Pox. The Recommendation 
only was printed. Thomas Dimsdale (1712-1800) had inoculated, in 1768, the Empress 
Catherine of Russia and her son Paul, and his title of "Baron" was of Russian origin, still 
borne by a descendant.

common enough, and I shall stand a Chance to be relieved. Let 
some others come here and see the Beauties and Sublimities of a 
Continental Congress. I will stay no longer. A Ride to Phila 
delphia, after the Small Pox, will contribute prodigiously to the 
Restoration of your Health. I am, etc. r^ Q s { gnature i 

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, July 26, 1776 

DEAR SIR, My Health has lasted much longer than I ex 
pected, but at last it fails. The Increasing Heat of the Weather, 
added to incessant Application to Business without any Inter 
missions of Exercise, has relaxed me to such a degree that a few 
Weeks more would totally incapacitate me for any Thing. I must 
therefore return Home. 

There will be no difficulty in finding Men suitable to send here, 
for my own Part as General Ward has resigned his Command in the 
Army I sincerely wish you would send him here. The Journey 
would contribute much to the Restoration of his Health, after the 
Small Pox, and his Knowledge in the Army and of military Mat 
ters is very much wanted here at present. 

Send Dana along for another, and come yourself by all Means. 
I should have mentioned you in the first Place. Will Lowell do? 
or Sewall? You will want four or five new ones. Major Hawley 
must be excused no longer. He may have the Small Pox here 
without keeping House an Hour and without Absence from Con 
gress four days. It would be vastly for his Health to have it. 

Send Palmer, or Lincoln, or Cushing if you will. Somebody 
you must send. Why will not Mr. Bowdoin or Dr. Winthrop take 

a Ride? r , r

PHILADELPHIA, July 27, 1776 

DEAR SIR, I have directed a Packett to you, by this days 
Post, and shall only add a few Words by Fessenden. I assure you 
the Necessity of your sending along fresh delegates here is not 



1776] Warren- Adams Letters 265 

chimerical. Paine has been very ill for this whole Week, and re 
mains in a bad Way. He has not been able to attend Congress, 
for several days, and if I was to judge by his Eye, his Skin, and his 
Cough, I should conclude he never would be fit to do duty there 
again, without a long Intermission, and a Course of Air, Exercise, 
Diet, and Medecine. In this I may be mistaken. The Secretary, 1 
between you and me is compleatly worn out. I wish he had gone 
home six months ago, and rested himself. Then, he might have 
done it without any Disadvantage. But in plain English he has 
been so long here, and his Strength, Spirit and Abilities so ex 
hausted, that an hundred such delegates, here would not be worth 
a Shilling. My Case is worse. My Face has grown pale, my Eyes 
weak and inflamed, my Nerves tremulous, and my Mind weak 
as Water fevourous Heats by Day and Sweats by Night are 
returned upon me, which is an infallible Symptom with me that 
it is Time to throw off all Care, for a Time and take a little Rest. 
I have several Times with the Blessing of God, saved my Life in 
this Way, and am now determined to attempt it once more. 

You must be very Speedy in appointing other Delegates, or you 
will not be represented here. Go home I will, if I leave the Massa 
chusetts without a Member here. You know my Resolutions in 
these Matters are not easily altered. 

I know better than any Body what my Constitution will bear, 
and what it will not, and you may depend upon it, I have already 
tempted it beyond Prudence and Safety. A few Months Rest-and 
Relaxation will recruit me. But this is absolutely necessary for 
that End. 

I have sent a Resignation to the General Court and am deter 
mined to take six Months rest at least I wish to be released 
from Philadelphia forever. But in Case the General Court should 
wish otherwise, which I hope they will not, I don t mean Surlily 
to refuse them. If you appoint Such a Number, that we can have 
a Respit, once in Six Months at furthest, or once in three if that 
is more convenient, I should be willing to take another Trick or 
two. But I will never again undertake upon any other Terms 

i In the Works of John Adams (ix. 428) the sentence reads "Mr. S. Adams, between 
you "etc.

unless I should undertake for a Year and bring my Wife and four 
Children with me, as many other Gentlemen here have done; 
which as I know it would be infinitely more agreeable, and more 
for the Benefit of my Children, so in my Sincere opinion, it would 
be cheaper for the Province, because I am sure I could bring my 
whole Family here and maintain it as cheap as I can live here 
Single at Board with a servant and two Horses. I am, etc.

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
BOSTON, August 7th, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, Reading and writeing have for some time past 
been interdicted on account of the small pox affecting my eyes, 
which is the reason that you have heard from me so seldom of late. 
I generally scribble to you when opportunity presents, whether I 
have much or indeed any thing of consequence to say, or not. I 
received yours of the 24th, 25th, and 27th July, with the inclosed, 
which I have delivered as directed. I can t express the uneasiness 
they have given me. I have all along feared that the continual 
application to business, in a place and season so unfavourable to 
health would be too much for you; but had begun to flatter myself 
that either from being more used to the climate, or from a firmer 
state of nerves you would be able to go through this season. I hope 
a ride will recover you and my good friend the Secretary. This I 
hope for sincerely both for my own sake and that of the publick, 
for I know not how to fill your places. Sure I am that whoever 
succeeds must go on the great theatre under great disadvantages. 
However I am willing to give you all the relief in my power. You 
should have rest and relaxation. I would therefore make an addi 
tion to the delegation which might serve till you are recruited. I 
have mentioned it to Dana, who I think I should like for one. I 
suppose we shall not be able to persuade Major Hawley. I wish 
we could. The others you mention I fear, either for want of abili- 
ities or determined resolution, will not do. I am sorry to hear that 
Pain is also sick. Why do you fix yourselves down in a place so 
unhealthy? Is there no other on the Continent to which you might 



1776] IVarren- Adams Letters 267 

adjourn at least for the summer months? I shall expect you very 
soon. Our friend Mr. Gerry intends to return next week. I have 
no kind of news. Our attention is turned to New York, from which 
place we expect something important very soon. The spirit of 
privateering prevails here, and I think great numbers will soon 
be out. The General Court is prorogued to the last of this month- 
I hope our recruits are in the Army at York before now. I have 
done every thing I can to hurry them. I presume Mrs. Adams 
will give you a state of your family by this post and tell you they 
are well, and most of them through the small pox. This distemper 
has been generally more severe than usual, and attended with one 
circumstance unusual and very disagreable, the failure of Inocu 
lation in many instances, and thfe uncertainty of it in many others, 
by which means many take it in the natural way. I wish you 
better health and every happiness, and am yours Sincerely.

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 

BOSTON, August n, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, The singular situation and great sufferings 
of Mrs. Temple have induced me to advise her to write to you, and 
hope from an application to your justice and benevolence for all 
the aid and compensation that can with propriety be given. I have 
encouraged her to expect at least an answer to her letter, which is 
more than the President with all his politeness gave to one of 
which the inclosed is a copy. Had I known your state of health, or 
determination to return home, I should not have been the occasion 
of this trouble. I wish I could entertain you with any important 
intelligence. We have nothing going forward here but fixing out 
privateers, and condemnation and sale of prizes sent in by them, 
so many that I am quite lost in my estimate of them, and West 
India Goods are falling at a great rate. Yesterday arrived a prize 
taken by a York Privateer with several hundred bags of cotton (a 
capital article), etc., etc. While all this is going forward, and whole 
fleets have been here, and might have been taken by your ships if at 
sea, I can t sufficiently lament the languor, and seeming inatten- 



268 Warren- Adams Letters [1776 

tion to so important a matter. A very fine ship lies at Portsmouth 
waiting only for guns, and I am told there are not yet orders issued 
for manning those at Newbury Port. This delay disgusts the offi 
cers, and occasions them to repent entering the service. I informed 
you in my last that we were calling in every twenty-fifth man of the 
Train Band and Alarm List to supply the places of your Battalions 
called away, and already marched. These men are comeing into 
the place of Rendezvous, Dorchester Heights; but you have ap 
pointed no General Officer to command them, and unless General 
Ward can be prevailed on to continue, I know not how they can 
be furnished with pay, subsistence, barracks, utensils, or ordinance 
stores. Would it not be well to appoint a Major General to com 
mand in the Eastern department only ? I am not aware of any disad 
vantages in such an appointment. I hope before this the Confedera 
tion, arid matter of foreign Alliances are determined. As I suppose 
matters will go more glibly after the Declaration of Independence, 
which by the way was read this Afternoon by Doctor Cooper, and 
attended to by the Auditory with great solemnity and satisfaction. 
Matters of great importance must after all remain to be settled. 
Among which I Conceive Coin and Commerce are not to be reck 
oned among the smallest. These are indeed such intricate subjects 
that I dont pretend to comprehend them in their full extent. 
Your currency still retains its credit, but how long that will last if 
you continue large emissions, is difficult for me to guess. Com 
merce is a subject of amazeing extent. While such matters are 
on the carpet how can we spare you. I suppose Mrs. Adams will 
inform you by this Post that she and the children are well, tho 
Charles l has not yet had the small pox, which is the case with many 
others after being inoculated two, three, and even six or seven 
times. The Physicians can t account for this. Several persons 
that supposed they had it lightly last winter, and some before, now 
have it in the natural way. Mrs. Warren and myself have been 
fortunate enough to have it very cleverly and propose going home 
this week. She joins me in the sincerest regards, for you and Mrs. 
Adams, and wishes for your health and happiness. I am etc.,

If the news you have from France be true, the ball must wind up 
soon. God grant a confirmation. I long to be a Farmer again. 

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN * 

PHILADELPHIA, August 17, 1776 

DEAR SIR, I had a letter from you by the Post yesterday, 
congratulate you, and your other self, on your happy Passage, 
through the Small Pox. 

I must intreat you to embrace the earliest opportunity, after the 
General Court shall assemble, to elect some new Members to at 
tend here, at least one, instead of me. As to others they will follow, 
their own Inclinations. If it had not been for the critical State of 
Things, I should have been at Boston, e er now. But a Battle, 
being expected at New York, as it is every day, and has been for 
some Time, I thought it would not be well to leave my Station 
here. Indeed if the Decision Should be unfortunate, it will be 
absolutely necessary, for a Congress to be sitting and perhaps, I 
may be as well calculated to sustain Such a Shock, as Some others, 
it will be necessary to have Some Persons here, who will not be 
Seized with an Ague fit upon the Occasion. So much for froth! 
now for Something of Importance. Our Province has neglected 
Some particular Measures, apparently of Small Moment, which 
are really important. One in particular let me mention at present. 
You should have numbered your Regiments; and arranged all 
your officers, according to their Rank, and transmitted them to 
Congress, at least to your Delegates here. I assure you, I have 
suffered much for Want of this Information. Besides this has a 
great Effect upon the Public. The five and Twentyeth Regiment 
from the Republic of Massachusetts Bay, would make a Sound. 
New York, New Jersey, Pensilvania, Virginia, etc., are very Sen 
sible of this. They have taken this political precaution, and have 
found its advantage. It has a good Effect too upon officers. It 
makes them think themselves Men of Consequence, it excites their 
Ambition, and makes them stand upon their Honour. 

Another Subject of great Importance, We ought to have been 

I Printed in part in Works of John Adams, i. 253. 



270 Warren- Adams Letters [1776 

informed of, I mean your Navy. We ought to have known the 
Number of your armed Vessells, their Tonnage, Number of Guns, 
Weight of Metal, Number of Men, Officers Names, Ranks, Charac 
ters; in short, you should have given Us your compleat Army and 
Navy Lists. Besides this one would have thought We should have 
been informed by some Means or other, of the Privateers fitted 
out in your State their Size, Tonnage, Guns, Men, Officers 
Names and Characters. But in all these Respects I declare myself 
as ignorant, as the Duke de Choiseul, and I Suspect much more so. 
Our People have a curious Way of telling a Story. "The Con 
tinental Cruizers Hancock and Franklin, took a noble Prize" Ay! 
but who knows any Thing about the Said Cruisers? How large 
are they ? how many Guns ? 6, 9, 1 2, 1 8 or 24-Pounders ? how many 
Men? Who was the Commander? These Questions are asked me 
so often, that I am ashamed to repeat my Answer, I dont know, 
I can t tell, I have not heard, our province have never informed 
me. The Reputation of the Province, the Character of your 
officers, and the real Interests of both Suffer inexpressibly by this 
Inaccuracy and Negligence. Look into Coll. Campbell s Letter. 
With what Precision he states every particular of his own Force, 
of the Force of his Adversary, and how exact is his Narration of 
Facts and Circumstances, Step by Step? When shall We acquire 
equal Wisdom ? We must take more Pains to get Men of thorough 
Education and Accomplishments into every Department, civil, 
military, and naval. I am as usual. 

[No signature.] 

My Horse upon which I depended is ruined. How and where to 
get another to carry me home, I know not. I wrote to my Partner 
to Speak to some Members of the G. Court, to see if they could 
furnish me with a Couple of good Saddle Horses. If not she will 
be put to some Trouble I fear. 

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, August 21, 1776 

DEAR SIR, --Yours of Aug. n reached me Yesterday. Mrs. 
Temple shall have all the assistance which I can give her, but I 



Warren- Adams Letters 271 

fear it will be without success. It will be a Precedent for So many 
others, that there is no seeing the End of it. I shall answer her 
Letter by the next Post, and if I cannot promise her any Relief, 
I can assure her of Mr. Temple s Arrival, and of his having Leave 
to go home, which I presume will be more welcome News. 

The success of your Privateers is incouraging. I lament with 
you the Languor and Inattention to the Fleet. I wish I could 
explain to you my Sentiments upon this Subject, but I will not. 
I am determined you shall come here, and see, and hear, and feel 
for yourself, and that Major Hawley and Some others shall do the 
same. I must not write Strictures upon Characters. I set all Man 
kind a Swearing if I do. I must not point out to you, not even to 
you, the Causes of the Losses, Disgraces, and Misfortunes, that 
befall you. I make the Faces of my best Friends a mile long if I 
do. What then shall I do? Just what I have long Since determined, 
go home, and let two or three of you come here and fret yourselves, 
as long as I have done, untill you shall acknowledge that I had 
Reason. 

There is a Marine Committee, who have the Care of every 
Thing relating to the Navy. Hopkins and his Captains, Salton- 
stall, and Whipple, have been summoned here, and here they have 
lingered and their ships laid idle. I cannot, I will not explain this 
Business to you; because if I should, it would get into a News 
Paper, I suppose. You must come and see. 

We suffer inexpressibly for Want of Men of Business. Men 
acquainted with War by Sea and Land, Men who have no Pleasure 
but in Business. You have them, send them along. 

Have you got Boston Harbour sufficiently fortified? If not take 
no Rest untill it is done. Howe must have Winter Quarters, 
somewhere. If he can t obtain them at New York, he must attempt 
them at the Southward or Northward, it will be your Fault, if you 
are not prepared for him in the North. I took a Hint from your 
Letter and this day obtained a Resolution authorising and desiring 
General Ward to continue in the Command in the Eastern De 
partment, untill further orders. 1 I hope he will comply. He has 
some good Officers about him, and he does very well. We give

him the Credit in the War Office of making the best Returns that 
We receive from any Department. The Scene brightens at Ticon- 
deroga, and We have a very numerous Army at N. York. By the 
last Return We have more than Eight and twenty thousand Men 
including Officers, at New York, exclusive of all in the Jerseys. 
Since which Men have been pouring in from Connecticutt. Massa 
chusetts I think is rather lazy this Campaign. Remember me with 
all possible Respect to your good Lady, and believe me to be as

Letter to be committed. 1 I must depend upon the Gen. Court to 
send me a Couple of good Saddle Horses. 



JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, Septr. 4, 1776 

DEAR SIR, It is in vain for me to think of telling you News; be 
cause you have direct Intelligence from Ticonderoga much sooner 
than I have, and from N. York sooner than I can transmit it to you. 

Before this Time the Secretary has arrived, and will give you all 
the Information you can wish, concerning the State of Things here. 
Mr. G[erry] got in the day before yesterday, very well. 

There has been a Change in our Affairs at New York. What 
Effects it will produce I cant pretend to foretell, I confess, I do 
not clearly foresee. Lord Howe is surrounded with disaffected 
American Machiavellians, Exiles from Boston and elsewhere, who 
are instigating him to mingle Art with Force. He has sent Sullivan 
here, upon his Parol, with the most insidious, tho ridiculous Mes 
sage which you can conceive. 2 It has put Us rather in a delicate 
Situation, and gives Us much Trouble. Before this day no doubt 
you have appointed some other Persons to come here, and I shall 
embrace the first Opportunity, after our Affairs shall get into a 
more settled Train to return.

It is high Time, for me, I assure you; yet I will not go, while the 
present Fermentation lasts, but stay and watch the Crisis, and 
like a good Phisician assist Nature in throwing off the morbific 
Matter. The Bearer, Mr. Hare, is a Brother of the Gentleman of 
the same Name in this City, who has made himself so famous by 
introducing the Brewery of Porter into America. He wants to see 
our Country, Harvard Colledge, the Town of Boston, etc. If you 
can help him to such a Sight I should be glad. Can t you agree 
with him to erect a Brewery of Porter in Mass.? 1 Your Barley 
and Water too, are preferable to any here. 

Upon the Receipt of yours and Mrs. Temple s Letters I com 
municated the Contents of them to Congress, who appointed a 
Committee to consider them, who reported that the Trees should 
be paid for as Wood. The President I suppose has communicated 
the Resolution upon it, which agrees with the Report. I should 
be glad to write Mrs. Temple an Account of this, but have not 
Time. You will be so good as to let her know it. I answered her 
Letter before her affair was determined. 2

WATERTOWN, Sep. I9th, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, I wrote you in my last that we were about 
raising every fifth man of our Alarm and Train Band List to go to 
the aid of the Army at New York. Except from some remote 
Counties and Seaport Towns, we have now concluded that busi 
ness. 3 -The orders are gone out and they are now executing. Only 
one Regiment of them are to be taken to go to Rhode Island. 4

were first made in this country about the year 1774." Robert Hare and Son (the chemist),

Twells porter. The brew-house, in 1785, was in Callowhill Street, between Front and

this Session, which has been unusually short, 2 attended as much 
as we could to the capital articles of manufacturing cannon, small 
arms, saltpetre, lead, etc., and laid an embargo on the exportation 
of Lumber, even from one port to another till the first of Novem 
ber, least it should fall into the enemy s hands, and furnish them 
materials for winter quarters. 3 

I rec d yours of the 4th Instant by Mr. Hare, but have not had 
an opportunity of seeing him, and am now just setting out for 
home. If he tarrys till I return shall take care to see him. We have 
not yet made an addition to our Delegates, no body seems to be 
against it, many are indifferent about it, and those that wish to 
have it done, are at a loss where to find the men; so it is procras 
tinated and left to the next setting. I can easily conceive this is 
such a juncture as you would not like to leave Philadelphia. I hope 
such physicians as we most depend on wont leave us at this time. 
Tho I am anxiously concerned for your health, I could wish to 
have you stay a little longer. I have a great curiosity to know what 
the message carried by Sullivan was. We have had reports that 
Congress had chose a Committee to treat with Lord and General 
Howe and tho we liked the Committee, you being one of them, 
we did not approve the measure, and it has made more sober faces 
than the advantages gained by our enemies at Long Island, etc. 
My company are ready to set out and I must conclude. Your 
Friend, etc.

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

Sept. 25, 1776 

DR. SIR, This Express carries a new Plan of an Army l I 
hope the Gen. Court without one Moments delay will Send Com 
missions to whole Corps of their officers, either by Expresses or 
Committees to New York, and Ticonderoga, that as many Men 
may be inlisted without delay as possible. It may be best to send 
a Committee with full Powers to each Place. There is no Time 
to be lost. I inclose you a sett of Articles as lately amended. 
Discipline I hope will be introduced at last. I am,

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADA., Nov. 6, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, I just now receivd your obliging Letter of 
the 24th of October by the Post. I am exceedingly pleasd with the 
patriotick Spirit which prevails in our Genl. Assembly. Indeed 
it does them great Honor. I hope the Increase of Pay will be con- 
find to the Militia to induce them to continue in the Army till a 
full Inlistment of our Quota for a new Army shall be compleated 
on the Encouragement offerd by Congress, which I have found 
since I left you is increasd by a suit of Cloaths annually. Congress 
could not account for the Delay of the Assemblies to send Com 
mittees to the Camp agreeable to their Recommendation, but by 
your Letter I am led to believe that the answer of our Assembly 
was among those Letters which were lately stolen from an Express 
on the Road. The Necessity of immediate Application to the im 
portant Business of inlisting a new Army indued Congress to 
direct the Commander in Chief to give orders for that Purpose 
even though the Committees should not have arrivd. I am glad 
however that your Committee is gone to Head Quarters, for I 
am persuaded they will be very usefull. I hear with Pleasure that 
you have appointed a Committee of War. 2 It has ever appeared

24, and on October 30 named the following members: James Bowdoin, George Whitcomb,

to me to be necessary and it must be attended with happy Effects. 
While we are taking such Measures as I trust will be effectual to 
put a Stop to and totally defeat the Designs of the open Invaders 
of our Rights, are we not too inattentive to the Machinations of 
our secret and perhaps more inveterate Enemies? Believe me, it 
is my Opinion that of the two, the latter are by far the more dan 
gerous. I hope you have not many of these among you, Some I 
know you have. Measures are taking here to suppress them. 

Nov. 9th. Mr. Partridge l arrivd in this City the last Evening, 
having been dispatchd by your Committee at Genl. Washington s 
Head Quarters, who have consulted with the General concerning 
the Augmentation made by our Assembly of the Pay of the Troops 
to be raisd by our State. The General advisd them to lay the Mat 
ter before Congress. We intend to bring it on this day. 2 I have 
strong Doubts whether it will succeed here. Men must be prevaild 
upon to inlist at some Rate or other, and I think it must be con- 
fessd that our State have shewn a laudable Zeal for the publick 
Service. But if the other States which are to have Troops in the 
Army should not consent to give the same Encouragement, it may 
cause great Uneasiness among them. I am the more ready to be 
lieve it will not be well receivd in Congress because a proposal 
made not long ago by the Maryland Convention for them to offer 
to their Men Ten Dollars in Lieu of the 100 Acres of Land was 
rejected. 

Nov. ii. On Saturday last Congress considerd the Business 
on which Mr. Partridge is here. A Comte. was appointed who 
have this day reported against your Resolution and the Report 
is agreed to, but as the Resolution must be known to the Soldiers, 
it has greatly embarrassd us. A Motion was made to limit the 
Duration of the Inlistments, which after Debate was postpond 
and is to be determind tomorrow. If the present Encouragement 
offerd by Congress is continued only for a limited Time of three

further of this Affair tomorrow. 

Nov. 1 2th. The Motion I yesterday mentiond has been this 
Day considered and Congress have resolvd upon an Alternative; 
that is, so far to reconsider their former Resolution as to admit of 
Inlistments for three years with the Bounty of 20 Dollars and the 
Suit of Cloaths annually, or during the War, with the Addition 
of the loo Acres of Land ; and our Committee is desired not to offer 
the further Encouragement of 20 / You will have a Copy of this 
Resolution sent to you by the President. Would it not be proper 
to send immediate Instructions to your Committees at the several

most important Business of procuring a new Army? I am affec

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADA., Novr. i6th, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, I have already wrote to you by this Convey 
ance. The Express having been delayed till this Time affords me 
an Opportunity of congratulating you and my other Friends on 
the Retreat of General Carleton with his whole Force from Crown 
Point into Canada, an Account of which we had the day before 
yesterday in a Letter from General Gates. 1 Yesterday we had a 
Letter from a Gentleman 2 living on the Sea Coasts of New Jer 
sey, acquainting us that near 100 Sail of the Enemies Transports, 
with a 50- or 6o-Gun Ship and two Frigates, were seen coming 
from Sandy Hook and steering Eastward [southward]. 

We had also a Letter from Genl. Greene, 3 who informs that he 
had Intelligence by a Gentleman of good Credit who came from 
Staten Island, that Ten Thousand of the Enemies Troops were 
embarqued, and it was given out that they were destind to South 
Carolina. It is said that Lord Dunmore is to take the Command, 
from whence one would suppose they are bound to Virginia. Some

think they are coming to this City, which I confess as an Ameri 
can I would chuse. The People here are preparing to give them a 
proper Reception. Wherever they may make the Attack, I flatter 
myself a good Account will be given of them. If so great a Part 
of the Enemies Army is withdrawn from New York may we not 
reasonably expect that the Remainder will be easily conquered 
this Winter. I am earnestly sollicitous that they may have a 
handsome Drubbing. We must not, however, suffer any flattering 
Prospect to abate our Zeal in procuring a sufficient Army. We 
know not what Game our Enemies may play. There is no Reason 
to believe they will quit their darling Plan of subduing, if possible, 
the New England States. We ought therefore to be very vigilant 
and active. An Army we must keep up. A Plan is now in Agita 
tion to prevent the Soldiers being abusd by the Extortion of 
Sutlers. 

Nov. lyth. I know not what detains this Express, but he is 
still here, which affords me an Opportunity of informing you that 
we have this day reed a Letter from Genl. Gates. 1 Your advancd 
Pay to the Soldiers is as disagreeable to him as it is to Genl. Wash 
ington and for the same Reason. 

Pray write to me by every opportunity and believe me to be 
your Friend. 2

MY DEAR SIR, I wrote to you two days ago by a Captn. 
Potes. This will be deliverd to you by Mr. Livingston who is 
employed by a Committee of Congress to repair to the Eastern 
States to purchase cloathing for the Army. I inclosd to you not

Committee had collected a good Stock of Cloaths. I had venturd 
almost to assure Congress that this had been done. There is a 
fatality attends the Post notwithstanding all that has been done 
to regulate it, so that we can seldom get Intelligence from our 
Constituents, while the Gentlemen of other States have Advice 
from theirs either by Post or Express at least every Week. Would 
you believe it, we had but one Post from the Eastward since my 
last Arrival here on the 24th of October. I wish we could hear 
often from you. Much is to be done this Winter to prepare for 
the ensuing Spring. The Enemy it is now said, are in retreating 
order from Brunswick. 

By the last Accounts from the Northward we are informd that 
the Ice begins to make on the Lakes. A few choice Friends have 
conceivd it very practicable when the Enemies Vessels are closd 
in -the Ice to destroy them by burning. Could this be done it 
would exceedingly distress the Enemy and confound them. I con 
fess I am enthusiastical in this Matter. I wish you would consult 
a few concerning it. If it is a Proposal worth your Notice, and I 
hardly doubt you will think it so, it must be communicated to a 
very few. I should think it would be best set on foot and executed 
by the New England People and I dare say there are trusty Men 
in our State who thoroughly understand such kind of Business. 
Sat Ferbum Sapienti. Think seriously of it. Adieu.

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, Deer. 12, 1776 

MY DEAR SIR, As I keep no Copies of my Letters, you must 
excuse me if I sometimes make Repetitions. I recollect that in 
my last I gave you some Account of the Movements of the two 
Armies. The Enemy have advanced as far as Trenton, thirty 
Miles from this City, and this Evening we are informd that a body 
of about 400 Hessians are got to Burlington, about 17 miles dis 
tance on the opposite Side of the Delaware. Nothing can exceed 
the Lethargy that has seizd the People of this State and the Jer 
seys. Our Friends who belong to those States are unwilling to have 



280 Warren- Adams Letters [1776 

it imputed to Disaffection and indeed I am unwilling myself to 
attribute it to so shameful a Cause. Npn-Resistance is the pro 
fessed Principle of Quakers, but the Religion of many of them is 
to. get money and sleep, as the vulgar Phrase is, in a whole Skin. 
The Interest of the Proprietor is at Antipodes with that of Amer 
ica. At least I suppose he thinks so, and though he is apparently 
inactive, there are many Engines which he can secretly set to 
Work. These are no doubt partly the Causes of the Evil. Besides 
there are many Tories here who have been for Months past exciting 
a violent Contest among the well affected about their new form 
of Government, on purpose to imbitter their Spirits and divert 
their Attention from the great Cause. But the foundation of all 
was laid Months ago through the Folly, I will not say a harsher 
Word, of that excellent superlatively wise and great Patriot 
D[ickinson], who from the loth of Septr. 1774, to the 4th of July, 
1776, has been urging upon every Individual and Body of Men 
over whom he had any Influence, the Necessity of making Terms 
of Accommodation with Great Britain. With this he has poisend 
the Minds of the People, the Effect of which is a total Stagnation 
of the Power of Resentment, the utter Loss of every manly Sen 
timent of Liberty and Virtue. I give up this City and State for lost 
until recovered by other Americans. Our cause however will be 
supported. It is the Cause of God and Men, and virtuous Men by 
the Smiles of Heaven will bring it to a happy Issue. Our Army is 
reducd to an handful and I suppose by the last of this Month 
will be reduced to Nothing; and Some of the Friends think the 
Congress will soon be taken napping. There are I am well as 
sured, Materials in this great Continent to make as good an Army, 
if not a better Congress. There are indeed some Members of 
that respectable body whose Understanding and true Patriotism 
I revere. May God prosper them and increase the Number! 
Where are your new Members? I greatly applaud your Choice 
of them. Mr. J. A. I hope is on the Road. We never wanted him 
more. Mr. P[aine] has this day left the Congress having leave 
after laboring in the service Sixteen Months without Cessation. 
I wish him safe with his Family. We seldom hear from N. England 
One Post perhaps in a Month! I am told that Soldiers inlist there

very briskly. I wish I could have an Assurance of it from you. 
Have you provided a good Stock of Cloathing? I have ventured 
almost positively to assert that you have. It would be a Satisfac 
tion to me to be authorized by you to assert it. Britain will strain 
every Nerve to subjugate America the next year. She will call 
wicked Men and Devils to her Aid. Remember that New England 
is the Object of her Fury. She hates her for the very Reason for 
which virtuous Men even adore her. Are you enough on your 
Guard? Is Boston sufficiently fortified? For your Comfort I will 
tell you that in my Opinion our Affairs abroad wear a promising 
Aspect. I wish I could be more explicit, but I conjure you not to 
depend too much upon foreign Aid. Let America exert her own 
Strength. Let her depend upon Gods Blessing, and He who can 
not be indifferent to her righteous Cause will even work Miracles 
if necessary to carry her thro this glorious Conflict, and establish 
her feet upon a Rock. Adieu my Friend, the Clock strikes 
Twelve.

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

BALTIMORE, Jany. i, 1777. 

MY DEAR SIR, I am determined to omit no opportunity of 
writing to you although I have very seldom of late receivd a Letter 
from you. Your second Favor came to my hands a few days ago, 
inclosing Copies of Papers from Spain. I am much obliged to you 
for them. Our Affairs in Europe look well, and additional Measures 
have been taken here, to establish them in that Part of the World 
on a solid Foundation. I assure you Business has been done since 
we came to this place, more to my Satisfaction than any or every 
thing done before, excepting the Declaration of Independence, 
which should have been made immediately after the iQth of April, 

75. 

Our Ministers abroad are directed to assure foreign Courts , that 
notwithstanding the artful and insidious Representations of the 
Emissaries of Britain to the Contrary, the Congress and People of 
the United States are determind to maintain their Independence 



282 Warren- Adams Letters [1777 

at all Events. 1 This was done before the Success of our Arms in 
Jersey of which you will doubtless have receivd Intelligence before 
this Letter will reach you. Generals Sullivan and Green com 
manded the two Divisions. The Enemy had before made Lee a 
Prisoner; but we have convincd them that great as his Abilities 
are, we can beat them without him. I now think that Britain will 
make a contemptible Figure in America and Europe, but we must 
still make our utmost Exertions. Pray let the levies required of 
our State be raisd with all possible Expedition. By this Convey 
ance you will have a Resolution vesting large Powers in General 
Washington, for a limitted time. 2 It became in my Opinion neces 
sary. The Hint I gave you some time ago I still think very im 
portant. Genl. Gates arrivd here the day before yesterday. I have 
conversd with him upon it. He told me he had conceivd it before 
and wishes the Measure may be tryed. It requires Secrecy and 
Dispatch. Lt. Colo. Stuart 3 will set off tomorrow with Directions 
to proceed as far as Boston to purchase Ordnance and other 
Stores, if they cannot be procured elsewhere. He is General Gates 
Aid de Camp and is very clever. I wish you would take Notice of 
him.

room of a fresh supply. It would give me additional pleasure to 
bring you often in arrears if it was not for trespassing on those 
important hours which from your extensive Correspondence and 
the happy arrangement of your domestic Concerns can admit 
but of little vacancy. I must confess to you the inauspicious ap

in his mind encreasd the anxiety of my too often desponding 
imagination but I think a New Year presents a brighter View. I 
congratulate you on our late Success, let us my friend enjoy this 
Victory, and tho a Skillful General has been meanly kidnapped 
let us not think the Fate of America hangs on the Prowess of a 
single person. My son William receivd a letter last night from an 
officer of distinguished rank in the army who writes The Scale 
is turnd greatly in our Favor. The enemy are intimidated and 
fleeing before them and says if we had but 5000 Continental Troops 
he makes no doubt they would be able to cut them all off. How 
ever he hopes to diminish them greatly. What a pity it is to want 
men at so important a Crisis. He gives the N. Englanders great 
merit in the Late glorious Action. He mentions a brisk Cannonade 
supposed to be at Princetown Jany the jd from whence we expect 
some important news. The description you give of the meeting of 
our Ambassadors on Long Island is romantically pleasing. The 
Sage the Venerable Mentor who is gone beyond Sea I think gives 
a dignity to all his Negotiations. I wish to Heaven he may succeed 
in what ever he undertakes. He wrote a short leave to the small 
Circle of His Favorites intimating that His encreasing Years 
forbid him thinking of a return to his Native Clime; but he left 
them with the most invigorating Sentiments of Affection for His 
dear Country. How happy would it be if such Valuable lives might 
be protracted beyond the four score Limits. I hear the other 
gentleman is now blest with returning Spirits. I long to know your 
Sentiments of present Appearances. I hear Plimouth has producd 
lately a Prophetical Egg that bodes no good to America for the 
year 77, but as it is said to be laid by a Tory hen I interpret it to 
be what is wishd rather than what will happen. The inscription 
on it is said to be Howe will Conquer America, but I believe the 
Prophecy will prove as Brittle as the Tablet on which it is engravd . 
If I tho t you would not charge me with an Affectation of 
dabbling in Astronomy I would tell you I was lately an Humble 
Attendant on my observer of the grand movements of the Celes 
tial Orbs in His observation of Cynthia in Eclipsing that glorious 
Luminary that rules the day. However enwrapt in incertainty the

regularity reigns there. No intervening accident can prevent the 
Completion of their appointed route. The Sky at the begining of 
the Eclipse was unkindly overspread with Clouds but soon Cleard 
off, and gave so good a View as to be able to judge with Precision 
the Quantity and duration of the Moon s path over the Sun. He 
has also this fall taken a trip with little Mercury across the Sun 
similar to the Transit of Venus. I think a beautifull Sight. I assure 
you these are great Points to an astronomer, tho the greater 
part of Mankind are so inattentive to these Glorious works of 
an Almighty Creator that they rise and shine and perform their 
amazing Circuits without any other observation than its being 
sometimes a fine sunshine day, or a fine Starlight Evening. Now 
I have incurrd your Censure pray pass Sentence; however I hope 
the inhabitants of those States are better employd than in spread 
ing devastation and death among their Loyal Subjects and 
brethren. My Sister has been obligd to make another move, they 
reside in Coll. Phips s House. Her pearly drops are often flowing 
at her unhappy Situation five removes since the Cruel burning 
of Charlestown. I endeavor to bring to her View the Scenes of 
ravage and bloodshed which mark the progress of British and 
Hessian Troops thro the Jerseys, enough to thaw the most frozen 
heart, but it is much easier to Preach Fortitude and Patience 
under Sufferings than to Practice them. You and I are enjoying 
our homes, but I dare not indulge the thought how it will be with 
us in the Spring the only Consolating Consideration is an alwise 
Superintendant at Helm with Universal Nature at Command.

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

BALTIMORE, Jany. 16, 1777 

I [have] receivd a Letter a few days ago from the Council of 
Massachusetts Bay, requesting a Sum of Money for [paying the] 
Bounty to the Troops to be raisd in that State. Accordingly three 
hundred thousand Dollars are orderd for that Purpose, 1 which 
will be forwarded to the Paymaster in Boston 2 as soon as it can 
conveniently be done. In the Mean Time I hope our Assembly 
will advance if necessary, for the Levies must be made at all 
Events. I observe that our Assembly have made it necessary that 
three of their Delegates should be present and concurring in 
Opinion, before the Voice of our State can be taken on any Ques 
tion in Congress. 3 I could wish it had been otherwise. Three only 
of your Delegates are now present. It may so happen at other 
Times. One of them may be sick. He may be on a Committee or 
necessarily absent on publick Business, in which Case our State 
will not be effectually represented. While I am writing at the 
Table in Congress a worthy Colleague is unavoidably employd on 
Business of the Publick at home, and the two present cannot give 
the Voice of the State upon a Matter now in Question. Were all 
the three present, one of them might controul the other two so 
far as to oblige them to be silent when the Question is called for. 
But I only mention the Matter, and submit, as it becomes me, to 
the Judgment of my Superiors. 

Major Hawley and my other patriotic Fellow Labourers, Are 
they alive and in Health? I have not receivd a Line from any of 
them excepting my worthy Friend, Mr. Nath. Appleton, whose 
Letter I will acknowledge to him by the first Opportunity. My 
Friends surely cannot think I can go thro the arduous Business 
assignd to me here, without their Advice and Assistance. I do not 
know whether you ever intend to write to me again. Assure the 
Major from me that a few more of his "broken Hints" would be 
of eminent Service to me. You cannot imagine how much I am

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

BALTIMORE, Feb. i, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, The Proceedings of the Committee of the four 
New England States have been read in Congress and are now 
under the Consideration of a Committee of the whole. 2 They are 
much applauded as being wise and salutary. I had heard that one 
of your Delegates at that Convention 3 had written a long Letter 
to his Friend and Confident here; and hearing it whisperd that the 
Massachusetts State had disapprovd of those Proceedings I was 
led to ask the Gentleman who had receivd the Letter concerning 
it. He confirmd it, and said that not only the Trade, but the landed 
Gentlemen in the House of Representatives were sanguine against 

1 John Allan. His instructions are in Journals of the Continental Congress, vn. 38. 

2 Transmitted to Congress by Governor Trumbull, January 12, and received by that 
body the 28th. The convention met at Providence December 25, 1776, and separated Jan

Ihe approval of the Continental Congress is in the Journals, vn. 124.

it. I beggd him to let me see his Letter; but he refusd in a kind of 
Pet, telling me it was a private Letter. I was left to conjecture, 
whether I had been really impertinent in asking a Sight of his 
Letter, or whether the Contents of it were such as it was not proper 
for me to see. You will easily conceive what a Scituation one must 
be in here, who having receivd no Intelligence himself, of the Sen 
timents of his Constituents, is obligd in vain to ask of another, 
upon what Principles they have disapprovd of a Measure (if indeed 
they did disapprove of it) upon which he is called to give his own 
Opinion. But it is difficult to account for men s peevish Humors, 
and it is generally not worth ones while to attempt it. You see, 
my Friend, from this Instance, the Necessity of your writing to 
me oftener. When I was told upon the forementiond Occasion, 
that I would be intitled to see the Letters of Another, whenever 
I should be disposd to communicate those which I receive myself, 
I could have said truly that I had scarcely receivd any. 

Two only from you in the Space of near four Months. But I 
have no Claim to your Favors, however much I value them, unless 
perhaps upon the Score of my having not neglected to write to you 
by any Opportunity. Your omitting of late even to acknowledge 
the Receipt of my Letters, I might indeed construe as a Silent 
Hint that they were displeasing to you. 

But I will not believe this till I have it under your own Hand. 

While I am writing, your very acceptable Letter is brought to 
me by Mr. Lovell. You therein speak, as you ever have done, the 
Language of my Soul. Mr. Adams tells me you are President of 
the Board of War; I am therefore indued to recall what I have just 
now said, which you may construe as an implied Censure for your 
not having written to me oftener. I am sure you must have a 
great Deal of Business. I am not sorry for it, for a Reason which I 
need not mention. I pray God to preserve the Health of your 
Body and the Vigor of your Mind. We must chearfully deny our 
selves domestick Happiness and the Tranquility of private Life, 
when our Country demands our Services. 

Give me leave to hint to you my Opinion that it would be a 
Saving to our State in the Way of Supplys, if the Board of War 
would consign the Cargoes which they order here to a Merchant of 



288 Warren- Adams Letters [1777 

good Character rather than to the Master of the Vessel. Possibly 
there may be some Exceptions; But I have Reason to think that a 
Cargo which arrivd about a Fortnight ago, consisting as I am told, 
chiefly of Rum and Sugars which were scarce Articles, was sold at 
least 30 pCt under what it would have fetchd, if it had been under 
the Direction of a Person acquaintd in the Place; and Flour is 
purchasing by the Person who bo t the Cargo, and I suppose 
expects an Allowance therefor, at an unlimitted Price. I am per- 
swaded, if you had by a previous Letter directed a Cargo to be 
procurd, you might have had it 20 pCt cheaper. If the Board 
should be of my Mind, I know of no Gentlemen whom I would 
more freely recommend than Messrs Samuel and Robert Purvy- 
ance. They are Merchants of Character, honest and discrete Men, 
and warmly attached to our all-important Cause. 

But I get out of my Line when I touch upon Commerce. It is 
a Subject which I never understood. Adieu my dear Friend. 
Believe me to be yours, 

S. A. 

P.S. I forgot to tell you that, a fair Occasion offering, I movd in 
Congress that the Eldest son of our deceasd Friend Genl. Warren 
might be adopted by the Continent and educated at the publick 
expense. The Motion was pleasing to all and a Committee is 
appointed to prepare a Resolve. A Monument is also proposd in 
Memory of him and Genl. Mercer whose youngest Son is also to 
be adopted and educated. But these things I would not have yet 
made publick. 1 



JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

BALTIMORE, Feby. 3, 1777 

DEAR SIR After a very tedious Journey through the severest 
Weather, and over very bad Mountains in one Part of it, and per 
fect Mortar in the other Part, I am arrived in good Health and 
Spirits at Baltimore. 

Congress is Sitting, and by the best Information I can obtain 

I Journals of the Continental Congress, vn. 243. 



Warren- Adams Letters 289 

from our Friends, are very well united and much more Spirited 
than ever. 

The Recruiting Service goes on as every Body tells me from 
Boston to Baltimore, very well, and it is here said, in Virginia. I 
cannot sufficiently express the Sense I have of the indispensible 
Importance that our State should be the earliest and most exem 
plary in compleating our Quota. It may be depended upon, that 
our State is the Barometer at which every other Looks. If the 
Mercury rises there, it will rise in every other Part of the Conti 
nent, if it falls there, it will fall everywhere. 

By all that I can gather, the British Ministry have sollicited 
for Cossacks. The Success is doubtfull. But it is the opinion of 
a Man in England whose Intelligence has heretofore proved 
extreamly exact that the Ministry will be able to obtain near 
Twenty thousand Recruits in England, Scotland, and Ireland, and 
Germany. If this Conjecture is right, there is great Reason to 
Suppose that they will not Venture upon So dangerous a Step as 
that of procuring Siberians. Their late great Succeses will in their 
Opinion render them unnecessary. 

But in all Events, it is our Wisdom, our Prudence, our Policy, 
our Cunning, our Duty, our every Thing, to destroy those who are 
now in America. They are compleatly in our Power and if We do 
not embrace the Opportunity, We shall not only in dust and ashes 
repent of our Sloth, but it will be but Justice that We should 
Suffer the wretched Consequences of it. I am Sure our brave New 
Englandmen can break the Force at Newport, and even the main 
Body at Brunswick may be imprisoned. But an Army is wanting. 
Don t let it be wanting long. 

Congress will do and have done what they can, but if the States 
will not execute the plans and Resolutions of Congress, what is 
to be expected ? 

New England I find is now in higher Estimation than it has been. 
Our Troops have behaved nobly, and turned the Fortune of the 
War. Pray let us keep up our Credit as I am sure We can. Adieu, 
my dear Friend. 1

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

BALTIMORE, Feb. n, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, I beg Leave to inclose my Account of Expences 
from the 26th of April, 1775, to the 27th of August, 1776, amount 
ing to [blank]. I intended to have laid it before the House of Repre 
sentatives when I was last in New England; but the sudden Ad 
journment of the General Assembly in September and my Hurry 
in preparing for my Journey hither, after its sitting again in 
October, prevented my attending to it. 

When I set off from Lexington after the memorable Battle there 
I had with me only the Cloaths upon my Back, which were very 
much worn, those which I had provided for myself being in Boston, 
and it was out of my Power then to recover them. I was therefore 
laid under a Necessity, in order to appear in any kind of Decency 
of being at an extraordinary Expence for Cloathing and Linnen 
after my Arrival in Philadelphia, which I think makes a reasonable 
Charge of Barrils, Leonards, and Stilles Bills in my Account. 

It may perhaps be necessary to say something of the Charge 
of Horsehire in the last Article. When I left Watertown in Sep 
tember, 75, two Horses were deliverd to me out of the publick 
Stable by Order of the Honble. Council, for my Self and my 
Servant. They were very poor when I took them, and both tired 
on the Road as you will observe by my Account. One of them 
afterwards died in Philadelphia, which obligd me to purchase 
another in that City; and with this Horse I returnd to Boston the 
last Fall. His being my own Property, having purchasd him with 
out Charge to my Constituents I think gives me a Right to make 
a Charge of horse hire, which is left to be carried out in a Sum 
which shall be thought just and reasonable. Mr. A[dams] tells me 
he is obligd to pay seven pounds io/ for the Hire of each of his 
horses to Philadelphia. The other horse I left at Boston (being 
worn out) to be disposd of as should be judgd proper. 

I shall take it as a Favor if you will present the Account to the 
Honble House and acquaint the Committee to whom it may be 
referrd with the Reasons of the Charges above mentiond: and 
make any other Explanations which you may judge necessary. 



Warren- Adams Letters 291 

Mrs. A. has the Vouchers , to whom I beg of you to apply for them 
in Person before you present the Account. I wish it may be settled 
as soon as the House can conveniently attend to it. If an Allow 
ance for my Services is considerd at the same Time, which I have 
a particular Reason to wish may be done, you will please to be 
informd, that I sat off from Lexington to Worcester, on the 26th 
of April, 75, and returnd to Watertown on the I4th of August 
following. And again I sat off from Watertown on the first of 
September, 75, and returnd to Boston on the 27th of August, 76. 
I have troubled you with this Epistle of Horse hire and Shop 
Goods at a Time when, no doubt, your Attention is called to 
Affairs of the greatest Concern to our Country. Excuse me, my 
dear Friend, for once, and be assured that I am your affec 
tionate, 

S. A. 

PHILADA., March 25, 1777 

DR. SIR, The foregoing Letter I have detained for want of 
such Conveyance as I wishd for. Your two Letters of the and 
of Feby I have receivd, and have Time at present only to acknow 
ledge the Receipt of them, the Bearer being just now going. I 
cannot however omit sending you the agreeable Intelligence that 
a Vessel arrivd yesterday in this part with ten thousand Stands of 
Arms. This is indeed a very timely Supply. 

Mrs. A. will give you her Reasons, if you will ask her, why an 
Allowance should be made as soon as it can be done with Con 
venience, for my Services. This I suppose may be done altho any 
Circumstance should prevent the Adjustment of my account of 
Expense, which I do not foresee. Adieu.

BALTIMORE, Feb. 16, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, A few days ago, a small Expedition was made 
by the Authority of this State aided by a Detachment of Conti-

ner&gt;tal Regulars, to suppress the Tories in the Counties of Somerset 
and Worcester on the Eastern Shore of Chessepeak, where they 
are numerous and have arisen to a great Pitch of Insolence. 1 We 
this day have a Rumour that one of their Principals, a Doctor 
Cheyney, 2 is taken and we hope to hear of the Business being 
effectually done, very soon. In my Opinion, much more is to be 
apprehended from the secret Machinations of these rascally 
People, than from the open Violence of British and Hessian Sol 
diers, whose Success has been in a great Measure owing to the 
Aid they have receivd from them. You know that the Tories in 
America have always acted upon one System. Their Head 
Quarters used to be at Boston more lately at Philadelphia. 
They have continually embarrassed the publick Councils there 
and afforded Intelligence, Advice, and Assistance to General 
Howe. Their Influence is extended throughout the united States. 
Boston has its full Share of them, and yet I do not hear that 
Measures have been taken to suppress them. On the Contrary, 
I am informd that the Citizens are grown so polite, as to treat 
them with Tokens of Civility and Respect. Can a man take Fire 
into his Bosom, and not be burnd? Your Massachusetts Tories 
communicate with the Enemy in Britain as well as New York. 
They give and receive Intelligence, from whence they early form 
a Judgment of their Measures. I am told they discoverd an Air of 
insolent Tryumph in their Countenances, and saucily enjoyd the 
Success of Howe s Forces in Jersey before it happend. Indeed, my 
Friend, if Measures are not soon taken, and the most vigorous 
ones, to root out these pernicious Weeds, it will be in vain for 
America to persevere in this generous Struggle for the publick 
Liberty. 

General Howe has declared that he intends that General Lee 
shall be tried by the Laws of his Country. So he is considerd as a 
deserter from the British Army. You know the Resolution of 
Congress concerning this Matter. 3 It is my Opinion that Lt. Colo. 
Campbel 4 ought immediately to be secured. He is to be detained 
as one upon whom Retalliation is to be made. Would you believe

it, that after the shocking Inhumanities shown to our Country 
men in the Jerseys, plundering Houses, cruelly beating old Men, 
ravishing Maids, murdering Captives in cold Blood, and system 
atically starving Multitudes of Prisoners under his own Eye at 
New York, this humane General totally disavows his even winking 
at the Tragedy and allows that a few Instances may have happend 
which are rather to be lamented. Congress is now busy in consid 
ering on the Report of the joynt Committees of the Eastern States. 
A curious Debate arose on this Subject, which I have not time now 
to mention. I will explain it to you in my next. l Adieu my Friend.

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

BALTIMORE, Feb. 17, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, I have the melancholly Prospect before me of 
a Congress continually changing, untill very few Faces remain, 
that I saw in the first Congress. Not one from South Carolina, 
not one from North Carolina, only one from Virginia, only two 
from Maryland, not one from Pennsylvania, Not one from New 
Jersey, not one from New York, only one from Connecticutt, not 
one from Rhode Island, not one from New Hampshire, only one, 
at present, from the Massachusetts. Mr. S. Adams, Mr. Sherman, 
and Coll. Richard Henry Lee, Mr. Chase and Mr. Paca, are all 
that remain. The rest are dead, resigned, deserted or cutt up into 
Governors, etc. at home. 

I have the Pleasure however to See every day, that the Govern 
ments of the States are acquiring fresh Vigour and that every 
Department is working itself clear of Toryism, Timidity, Duplic 
ity, and Moderation. New Jersey was never so well represented 
as it is now. 2 Pensilvania whose Assembly will maintain its 
Ground have the last Week appointed a New Delegation, every 
Man of whom is as firm as a Rock. 3 Maryland also the last Week 

1 See Burke s " Abstract of Debates," in No. Ca. Colonial Records, xi. 391. 

2 The delegates chosen were Richard Stockton, Jonathan D. Sergeant, John Wither- 
spoon, Abraham Clark and Jonathan Elmer. In the absence of recorded votes it is not 
possible to say who attended the sessions at this time. 

3 On March 10 the General Assembly elected as delegates: Benjamin Franklin, Robert 
Morris, Daniel Roberdeau, Jonathan Bayard Smith, George Clymer and James Wilson.

compleated their new Government, chose Mr. Johnson 1 Governor, 
chose a new privy Council to the Governor, every Man of whom is 
an honest Whigg 2 and also chose a new Delegation in Congress, 
every Man of whom is equally Stanch, leaving out all who have 
been suspected of Trimming and hankering after the Leeks of 
Egypt. 3 

This evening too we have an ex[press torn] with an Account of 
the new Delegates [torn] who are said to be sound. 4 

Thus We see that our new Governments [are taking firm] root 
and Spreading their Branches [torn] ing Changes have We seen? 
[torn] done? 

I write you no News from the Army. [You are so placed] as to 
hear from it, oftener than [I can torn] rumour that gaind Credit 
of [an engagement torn] Sennight, the Enemy leaving 327 dead on 
the Field. 

Congress have this day voted to return to Philadelphia tomor 
row Week. The new Army, my dear Sir, the new Army. I feel as 
much Pain at loosing the fine Opportunity We now have of de 
stroying the Brunswickers, as I should if a surgeon was sawing oflf 
my Limbs.

PLYMOUTH, FeVy 22d, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, I had the pleasure yesterday of receiving 
your favours of the 3d and 5th Inst., the first that have come to 
hand since your departure. I am extreamly glad to hear of your 
safe arrival in health and good spirits at Baltimore. I have had 
some uneasiness about you, the weather has been very severe, and 
I supposed you must pursue a disagreeable if not a dangerous route;

3 In November, 1776, Maryland had chosen the following representatives in Congress, 
to serve until March, 1777: Matthew Tilghman, Thomas Johnson, jr., William Paca, 
Thomas Stone, Samuel Chase, Benjamin Rumsey, and Charles Carroll. On February 15, 
Chase, Rumsey, Carroll, Stone, and Paca were re-elected, and William Smith added. This 
leaves Tilghman as the "trimmer." Journals oj the Continental Congress, vi. 963; vn. 131.

but the climbing mountains and wadeing in difficulties of every 
kind has become so familiar to the politicians of this age, that I 
hoped one of the first of them would be able to go through it with 
out any bad effect on his health and spirits. Every letter I receive 
from Baltimore gives me the most pleasing accounts of the union 
and spirit of Congress. I hope soon to see the effects of them, but I 
observe that while you mention the probability that England is 
applying for Cossacks, etc., and that she will be able to raise a 
large number of men in her own dominions, and Germany, you 
say nothing of any expectations we are to entertain from foreign 
aid. I long to see a fleet of French and Spanish Men of War on our 
Coast, and our harbours full of their Merchantmen. I am very 
sensible of the prudence, policy, duty, etc., of destroying the army 
our enemies have already here before the arrival of any reinforce 
ment, and have no doubt it might be effected. I am anxiously con 
cerned that the honour and reputation of this State should be sup 
ported by the wisest and most exemplary exertions. The mercury 
rises as high in our political barometer as I could wish, but the 
misfortune is there are no steady fixed laws or principles to regu 
late its motions. The laws of gravity and uniformity have given 
place to levity, versatility, and impatience, the zeal in some to give 
every thing to the soldier, the impatience in others in takeing new 
measures before they could see the effects of what was already 
done, is such that no reason, argument, or influence, I am master 
of could carry through a resolve fixing upon something certain 
as an ultimatum beyond which in the way of encouragement we 
would not go; or prevent the sending out a resolve holding up to 
the soldiers a design of makeing a levy on the Towns which is in 
effect offering them a bounty of 50 or 60 dollars more, 1 and has as I 
expected and prophesyed stopped the inlistment of thousands, 
who now wait for the opportunity of filching as much money from 
their neighbours as they can. From hence has arisen all our diffi 
culties in raising our quota. I hope however we shall get through 
them, but it will be at an amazeing expence, three-quarters of 
which will be absolutely hove away. General Schuyler just before 
the Court rose wrote us a letter full of apprehensions of an attack 

I Resolves of the Mass. General Assembly, January 28, 1777.

on Ticonderoga. Four of the Battalions raising here, with what 
they have already got, have been under marching orders for that 
place sometime. Some of them are gone; the whole may amount to 
looo or 1 200 men, and I left the Court considering what other 
measures should be taken. I can t tell you what, if anything, has 
been done. The Court rose the day I left it, a fortnight ago by 
adjournment to the 5th March. 

I hope the British Troops now at Newport will not be able long 
to keep that place. What remains of them after 2000 gone to 
York, are a considerable part invalides. I believe there will soon 
be an attempt made in that quarter. I hope the service will not 
be injured, by any dissentions or want of subordination there or 
elsewhere. Congress have been very rapid in their promotions, 
and possibly in some instances have not had the necessary infor 
mation; but I could wish to see the officers appointed to any serv 
ice so disposed that the spirit and authority of the chief should be 
able to check and controul all the subordinates of every rank, how 
ever impatient of submission. I am glad to hear that the enlist 
ments to the Southward go on well. I hope by this means the serv 
ice will be supported till the New England quotas are compleat. 
I thank you for the account you give of the perticular situation of 
the other Colonies. 1 .When we shall form our Constitution, or in 
what manner we shall do it I am unable to say. Our own delays 
have embarrassed us, and I am persuaded the longer we delay this 
business the greater will be the difficulty in executing it. I am 
therefore constantly u^geing the necessity of going about it. Vari 
ous are the opinions both as to the manner of doing it, and as to the 
thing itself. Many are for haveing it done by a Convention, and 
many are for one Branch only. I hope both will be avoided. I 
don t see a better way as things are than by sending to the several 
Towns desireing them at their next elections to have it in view and 
vest their members with special powers for this purpose. 2 

I am extreemly pleased with the conduct of Virginia and Caro 
lina with regard to religious establishments. The dissenters there 
you say by this means have compleat Liberty of Conscience. Do

you mean that all distinctions in point of privileges and advantages 
are abolished? This is an evidence that Episcopacy and Liberty 
will not flourish in the same soil. I have intended to write to you 
before this but have been prevented by the multiplicity of business 
on my hands. The House have set generally to near nine and some 
times to ten o clock in the evening, and my station you know re 
quires constant attendance. If you enquire what we are about, 
I must tell you, many things which in my opinion we have nothing 
to do with, and which ought to be done by your G 1 here, if 
you mean he should do any thing for his pay and perquesites; and 
many others which would be done with more ease and dispatch 
if the powers of such a rara avis in terra were once defined and 
known, and whether the publick stores here might be applied to 
publick uses and how. As to news we have none. A few prizes, 
some of them valuable, have been sent in. Your Navy here still 
remains in port. When any of them go to Sea I can t say. The 
conduct of this part of your operations will be a subject of curious 
enquiry. I hear we are going to have another frigate and a 74- 
gun ship built here. Will the conduct of this matter be put into 
hands of persons who scarcely know the difference between a ship 
and a wheelbarrow, and who seem to have no ideas of the impor 
tance of dispatch, or know not how to make it? I want to give you 
a few anecdotes and to say many things which I dare not commit 
to writeing. Adieu, my Friend.

friendly correspondence. However, Sir, I shall ever be obliged by 
your Favors, and a communication of such things as you may 
consider either agreeable or interesting. 

The policy adopted for raising your Quota of Men, I could not 
but reprehend in some degree, having regard to the influence of the 
Precedent upon the States at large. At the same time I am willing 
to ascribe it to the motives you mention, and am well convinced 
that those and those only gave rise to it. I heartily wish the Ba- 
tallions may be soon compleated and for that purpose beg leave 
to suggest, that none should be wanting in their exertions. The 
Enemy now have a formidable force in the Country and are only 
waiting the Season to be a little more advanced, to begin their 
Operations; and I am persuaded, they indulge a pleasing hope of 
effecting some Capital Stroke, before we have an Army to oppose 
em, it behoves every nerve to be strained to baffle their views, 
and I flatter myself it might be accomplished, if our Troops can 
be collected, ere they open the Campaign, but of this I am not 
without the most painfull apprehension. A few days more, and 
the Spring is upon us, and nothing prevents their movements now, 
but the badness of the Roads. No material event has occurred of 
late worthy of mention and of which you will not have heard be 
fore this reaches you. Now and then there has been a skirmish 
which in the issue have been generally favourable. 

You will be pleased to inform Mrs. Warren that I transmitted 
her letter to Mrs. Washington by the earliest Opportunity after it 
came to hand, and requesting a tender of my respects to her, I 
have the Honor to be with great esteem, Sir, Your most Obedt 
Servant,

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, March 21, 1777 

DEAR SIR, It is not easy to penetrate the Designs of the En 
emy. What Object they have in View cannot certainly be de 
termined. Philadelphia most probably, and Albany. They have 
near Ten Thousand Men in the Jersies, at Brunswick, Amboy, 



300 Warren- Adams Letters [1777 

Bordentown and Piscataqua; 1 the two last Posts are very near 
their main Body. 

I think, but may be mistaken, that they will not hazard an 
Attempt upon this City or Albany, before they receive a Rein 
forcement. If they do, they must evacuate New Jersey, entirely, 
because they have not Men enough to leave sufficient Garrisons 
in Brunswick and Amboy, and march to Philadelphia, or to 
Albany with the Remainder. 

It is the Opinion of our General Officers, however, that they 
will march, within a very few days from South Amboy, through 
the Pines towards the Delaware. They are building Boats in N. 
York which may serve either for the Delaware, or Hudsons River, 
or indeed they may serve to draw their Army off, from Brunswick, 
by Rarriton River, Brunswick being about twelve Miles from 
the Sound between N. Jersey and Staten Island. 

What Reinforcements they will be able to obtain is uncertain. 
Is it not more probable that they will bring their Army round by 
Water, from Canada, and join General Howe, than that they will 
come over the Lakes? From England and Ireland, they can de 
rive no great Reinforcement; it is not known how many they can 
obtain from Germany. The Russian Auxiliaries are uncertain, 
but if they come they will certainly bring a French War with 
them. But in all Events I think We need not fear any consider 
able Reinforcement from Europe before Midsummer. The British 
Troops here, are not more sickly than usual: But the Hessians are 
sickly with Pleurisies and other Fevers. 

It is certain that if they should march to Philadelphia, and gain 
Possession of it, they have not Men enough to maintain a Line of 
Posts, by which a Communication can be kept open by Land, with 
New York. They must therefore evacuate New Jersey, which 
would leave their miserable Friends in that State in absolute 
Despair, and the Whiggs, already exasperated to a great degree, 
would assume new Vigour. Troops in the mean Time will be com

from the Southern; and the Militia of Philadelphia and Pensil 
vania will not be idle. So that they must expect to be cooped up in

the City and there perhaps destroyed, before a Reinforcement 
shall arrive. Besides this, they will be at such a Distance from 
New York and long Island that they may be under Apprehensions 
for those Places. Another Thing, I think they will not choose to 
divide their Fleet so much. They will not attempt Philadelphia, 
without a Force by Water, as well as by Land. They must keep a 
large Number of their Ships at New York, to protect that and the 
neighboring Islands, and many are at Newport. So that they can 
not Spare so many Ships as will be necessary to come up the River 
Delaware. 

These Reasons persuade me to differ from the Opinion of our 
General Officers, and to believe that no Attempt will be made 
upon Philadelphia, before a Reinforcement comes. I wish I may 
not be deceived, as this City by her central situation, Wealth, 
Artificers and several other Qualities, is of much Importance to 
us. But if they get it, they will not find so much Advantage from 
it, as they expect. It will cost them most or all of their Force to 
keep it, which will make it a Security to other Places. I am my 
Friend, Yours, etc.

MY DEAR MERCY, I wrote you Yesterday by Major Wads- 
worth, which I hope will reach you this day. Since which the 
Brigt. Independence has Arrived here. I met Cotton in the State 
House yesterday who seems to have pretty well recovered of his 
wound. One Mr. Wentworth came to town from Portsmouth also 
since I wrote, He is gone to Congress with Letters. From him is 
obtained a general Invoice of the Ship s Cargo, Copy of which I 
enclose you. 1 We also learn that with the 5&lt;D-Gun Ship Bound 
here are comeing 2 frigates of 30 odd Guns each and a number of 
small vessels all loaded. Doctor Franklin was reed in France with

every demonstration of Joy, with ringing of Bells, Bonfires, Illu 
minations, &c. and at Court like an Embassador, insomuch that 
Lord Stormont declared that he could not stay at Court under 
such Circumstances, and so retired. I have heard that he brings 
an account that the french Court have declared to the English 
Court that they consider America as an Independent State and 
therefore that they have, with the Consent of the Americans as 
good a right to trade there as any Nation, and that they shall 
Consider any interruption given by the English as a declaration of 
War. However that may be, which I am not able to ascertain, it 
is certain they have remonstrated against foreign troops comeing 
here. Dr. F. is in the Cabinet with the King almost every day, 
and I think we have a tolerable Earnest of his success. The Tories, 
poor Unhappy Creatures, had just fabricated and put into Circula 
tion a Story that the Doctor was frowned on at the french Court 
and would be glad to get away. This is all the news I can give you 
at this time. No Letter from you yet. I hope for one before Night. 
If I could hear you was well and in good spirits I should be happy. 
I am better myself. Do attend to your Health, that we may 
have a Chance of Enjoying some of the pleasing prospects before 
us. Give love to my Boys and accept a large Share to yourself

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
BOSTON, March 23d, 1777. 

MY DEAR SIR, I wrote you last from Plymouth about three 
weeks ago after which I was detained at home longer than I ex 
pected and did not get here till last Tuesday. I understand that 
letter and one wrote at the same time to Mrs. Adarns went by the 
Post. As I wrote with some freedom I should be glad to hear of 
the receipt of it. Since I have been here I have had the pleasure of 
yours of the I7th Feb y, and am glad to find the New Governments 
in the Southern States so well established and things going so 
agreably to your mind. 

Your reflections on the changes in Congress are very natural. 
I have the same feelings. I love to see the same faces, and lament 
the loss of my old acquaintance and connections; but changes and 
vicissitudes we must expect in the state we are now in, and per 
haps it is in many instances best, if not all it should be so, and in 
political bodies more especially. 

The New Army has been raised very slowly, and it is probable 
many advantages must be lost by it, but I hope we shall compleat 
it at last. If our Assembly could be kept from any new measures 
I believe we should soon get ours; but they have an unaccountable 
itch to be meddling everyday, and by that means keep the minds 
of the people always afloat, make them mercenary, and uncertain 
when to engage if inclined. We have, however, under all the dis 
advantages ariseing from the instability of our own conduct got 
as near as I can collect about 70x30 Non-Commissioned Officers 
and privates, and they are now inlisting fast. The idea of a levy 
on the several Towns, which we have I think injudiciously and 
without any necessity held up, has occasioned an immense expence

to individuals in addition to the publick bounty. We have lately 
voted the same bounty to a Battalion of the Train as we gave be 
fore, 1 and are now sollicited to do the same for three new Battal 
ions. I suppose we must comply and comfort ourselves with the 
hopes that it is but for once. We have had no news for some time 
till the arrival of a French Ship at Portsmouth, with a valuable 
cargo and agreable intelligence which you will have more perfectly 
than I can give you, gratified for a moment our curiosity, raised 
our spirits and gave us a subject of conversation. I shall therefore 
only congratulate you on this occasion, and inform you that we 
have three or four vessels out to furnish the other Ships expected 
here with pilots, and orders are given to receive them with cere 
mony, salutes, etc. No attempt has yet been made upon Rhode 
Island, which was expected and preparations made for it long ago, 
and now we are not in a condition for it; for tho British Troops 
are many of them gone, not more than 2500 remaining. Ours are 
reduced in a greater proportion. In short there are but about 500 
men from this State in addition to the Troops of their own State. 
Applications are made to us fo r a reinforcement, and a Committee 
are now considering in what way it shall be done. Our sea coasts 
and perticularly this harbour is also in a defenceless state and must 
be provided for. All these things are difficulties that interfere with 
compleating our quota, and embarrass us much. New Hampshire 
have got their part of the Army some time ago, but Connecticut 
are more behind hand than we are. 

General Ward resigned his Command last Thursday to Heath. 
What he is designed to command I know not. I neither see or hear 
of any men. About three hundred men only are here, besides 
Craft s Regiment, and their time expires in about ten days. 

But no one thing gives me more uneasiness than the conduct of 
your Fleet. The Hancock, Boston, Alfred and Cabot are all yet in 
port. It is said the Hancock is ready to sail and was to have gone 
yesterday, but remains here yet. I fear the consequences of their 
going out single. But McNeil and Manly it is said like the Jews 
and Samaritans will have no connections or intercourse; they will 
not sail together. I believe McNeil is near ready for the sea. I am

told that he and the Agent, Mr. Gushing, have had a breeze; but 
I am not acquainted with the perticulars or how it terminated. 
I have still a worse account of the situation of your frigates at 
Providence. I don t know the officers, but understand to say no 
more of them that they are not agreable to the people and never 
can man their ships. You must fall on some new plan for conduct 
ing your Naval Affairs at a distance from you, or be content never 
to shine in that way. Perhaps to establish a Board in each district 
upon an honourable footing, and with extensive powers or some 
thing (I know not what) else. If you should have occasion for a 
new Commander for one of your Ships I would venture to recom 
mend one I think equal to the business, and perhaps to any you 
have. Capt. Simeon Samson l who was lately taken in the service 
of this State I have a very good opinion of as a Seaman. A man 
of judgment, prudence, activity and courage, he behaved like a 
Hero in the action, but the force against him was so superiour to 
his that he had no chance. He is yet in captivity but his redemp 
tion is expected very soon as proper measures are taken for it. 
Our measures in General Court are so complicated and various 
that it would take a volume to give you an account of them. 

The regulating Act 2 has been observed in some places, and dis 
regarded in others, and perticularly here, where it is constantly 
violated in open daylight, and has yet produced no other conse 
quences but bitterness and wrath between the Town and Coun 
try, the last of which is endeavouring to starve the Town in return 
for what they consider ill usage from them and have succeeded 
so well, that the market here is little superiour to what it was in 
the siege. I ever thought this Act impracticable in its nature, and 
prophesied that it would end in bringing the Authority of Govern 
ment into contempt. My prophesies are likely to be compleated. 

1 Simeon Samson (son of Peleg), of Plymouth, commander of the brigantine Independence. 
He was taken by the British ship Rainbow, sent to Halifax, and was listed for exchange, 
June, 1777. He received a commission from Massachusetts to command an armed vessel 
then under construction, which may have been the Hazard, of which he was in command 
in August of that year. The following June he resigned on account of ill health, but appears 
to have sailed the Mars and Mercury. In the latter he carried Elkanah Watson to France 
in 1779. The Hazard, of 16 guns, was built by John Peck, of Plymouth, and was burned 
in the Penobscot expedition of 1779. Deborah Sampson was a cousin. Mass. Prov. Laws,

received this day from your good lady. This gentleman I suppose

ordered to be bought. 

This News you may depend on. The Letters were brought into

Pounds, it has been tried every Way, and has stood the fullest 
Proof. It has been discharged Twenty times and upon discharging 
it three Times successively as fast as it could be loaded and fired, 
with several Ounces of Powder more than the usual Quantity, it 
was observed not to be heated so much as other Guns of the same 
calliber commonly are where of Brass or cast Iron. 

It is so light, that it may be transported about with the Utmost 
Ease, by a few soldiers alone without Horses, and is therefore 
admirably adapted for a Regimental Field Piece. The Generals 
Gates, Green and Mifflin, have examined it, and admire it. We 
are about contracting for a Number of them. They are cheaper 
than Brass. They carry a Ball as far and as direct. The only 
objection is that they rebound too much. But this Inconvenience 
is easily remedied by strengthening the Carriage. The names of

of an interesting Nature. 2 We are under Injunctions of Silence 
concerning one very important Point: and indeed I don t know 
how far I am at Liberty concerning some others: but thus much I 
may venture to communicate: That We have an offer of three 
Millions of Livres in Specie, without Interest, and to be paid when 
We shall be settled in Peace and Independence; that all Europe 
wish Us well, excepting only Portugal and Russia; that all the 
Ports of France and Spain and Italy and all the Ports in the Medi

Merchant Ships. That there is no danger of our wanting Arms or

had plenty of Powder before. In short, my Friend, altho We have 
many grievous Things to bear, and shall have more; yet there is 
nothing wanting but Patience. Patience and Perseverance, will 
carry Us through this mighty Enterprize an Enterprize that 
is and will be an Astonishment to vulgar Minds all over the 
World, in this and in future Generations. An Enterprize however, 
which, Faithfullness to our Ancestors who have sett Us Examples 
of Resistance to Tyranny, Faithfullness to the present and future 
Generations, whose Freedom depend upon it laid us under every 
moral and religious obligation to undertake. Our Accounts from 
Europe are that great Preparations are making for War and that 
every Thing tends to that Object, but when or where, or how Hos 
tilities will commence is yet unknown. France and Spain, will act 
in concert and with perfect Amity, neither will take any Step 
without the other. 

The American Ministers abroad, advise Us to exert ourselves 
in every Respect, as if We were to receive no Assistance from 
abroad. This is certainly good Advice and if We have Wisdom 
enough to follow it, a Division by a War in Europe will be a more 
effectual Relief to us. I am, etc.

BOSTON, April 3d, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, I had the pleasure yesterday of receiving your 
favours of the I5th and i8th of March. There are few things I 
wish for more than a war between Britain and France, etc. I am 
therefore greatly pleased with the accounts you have of the prob 
ability of it. Such has been the situation of matters for some time 
that I could not see how it could be avoided, and yet my impa 
tience makes me uneasy at the delay, least something might inter 
vene to prevent it. I have a right to pray for it as an event that 
may serve my Country, and the chastisement of Britain for their 
own good, or their destruction for the good of Mankind perhaps 
are not improper subjects of prayer. 

I am glad you have raised your interest to six per Ct. 1 and am 
told that it has had a favourable influence here. Your Loan Office 
is successful. How much has been received I can t inform you. 
Your tickets that were sent here were all nearly sold in a few days, 
and perhaps double the number would have sold. Whether patriot 
ism or the hopes of Gain has occasioned this rapid sale of 12. or 
15.000 tickets in so short a time is a question that deserves the 
attention of the politician; but either of them will answer the 
present purpose. 

I hope the late inconvenience you have seen in voteing by 
States will stimulate you to form your Constitution. 2 That seems 
to be a matter as long in agitation with you as with us, and if 
something dont accelerate your motions we shall get the start of

you. We have agreed, I mean the House, upon a recommen 
dation to the people at their next election to choose their Repre 
sentatives for that among other purposes. The form they shall 
agree on however to be subject to the approbation of their 
Constituents. 1 

We have no news; are straining our nerves to forward our men, 
but our motions are slow. The enemy continue at Rhode Island, 
and have lately been reinforced from whence we know not. They 
now consist of about 4000. We have not been so attentive of late 
to the defence of that State as I think we ought to be; but we have 
now a Committee, and I hope if the enemy make no attempt on 
Providence, etc., in a few days, they will be in a posture of defence. 
The enemy are fortifying the Island, which looks as if they intended 
to continue there. There seems to be a prospect of a small breeze 
between the present College Treasurer 2 and some of his friends, 
as I am informed he refuses to resign, and has wrote some letters 
threatening vengeance if left out. The Overseers have however 
recommended to the Corporation to choose a new one, and I sup 
pose they intend it. 3 I wrote Mr. Adams yesterday about Mrs. 
Temple s affairs. I wish you would attend to it if any thing can 
be done. I am much hurried this morning and must conclude and 
am, as usual, your Sincere Friend, etc.

Truths should appear in Company with so many infamous Lyes 
as that Paper ushers into the World whenever it appears. 

I am much obliged to you for your Sentiments concerning the 
Navy. A Board I believe will be established at Boston, and a 
Commissioner in each considerable Port in New England. Com 
plaints are frequently brought here from Boston and from Provi 
dence concerning the Continental Agents and other Officers. I 
am sorry for this, but cannot help it. At Providence I fear, by 
what I have lately heard, there has been a System of Selfishness, 
and at Boston of Incapacity. I had the Honour of belonging to the 
first Naval Committee, which set all our maritime Affairs agoing; 1 
and they did it with a Vigour, Assiduity and Dispatch, which 
precluded all Censure and Complaint: But I went home last 
December was twelve Month, and Advantage was taken of that 
Opportunity, one or two other Members being absent at the same 
Time Coll. Lee went home, and Gadsden and Langdon and 
Deane was left out to choose a new Committee. 2 Since which 
there has been nothing but Languor, Censure and Complaint. 
Upon my Return they did me the Honour to put me upon the 
Board of War, which takes up my whole Time, every Morning 
and Evening, and renders it totally impossible for me to look into 
the marine Department, which if I had Leisure to do, ignorant as 
I am of every Rope in the Ship, I would perish if I did not put 
that Department in a respectable order. There is nothing wanting 
but some one Person whose Vigour, Punctuality, and Constancy, 
should draw the Committee together every Morning and Evening, 
direct their Attention to the Object, and keep it fixed there. 
There are Gentlemen enough of the Committee who understand 
the Business, and the Board of Assistants are pretty well qualified 
and every Man upon the Continent who knows any Thing of the 
Subject might easily be induced to contribute the Assistance of 
his Knowledge at least by Letter. The Fracas between [Manley] 
and McNeal had reached this Place before your Letter, hope it

This Letter, so full of myself and so abusive to others, is intended 
barely to exculpate myself. I cannot bear any share of the Blame 
of the failures in the marine Department. 



JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, April 6, 1777 

MY FRIEND, The Business of the naval and marine Depart 
ment will I hope be soon put in a better Train than it has been. 
A Board of Assistants has been appointed here consisting of 
three Gentlemen, not Members of Congress, whose whole Time 
is devoted to the Service, Mr. Hopkinson, Coll. Nixon and 
Mr. John Wharton are the Men. 1 The first is a Gentleman of 
Letters, the second an able Merchant, the third an eminent 
shipwright. 

There is a Talk of appointing a similar Board at Boston 2 and a 
Commissioner at every considerable Port in N. England. Who 
would be proper Persons for those Places? They should be well 
acquainted with Navigation. They should be well informed in 
Trade. They should be Men of Character and Credit. 

The Marine Committee have lately reed. Letters from Captns 
Thompson, McNeal 3 and several others, pointing out Defects, 
Abuses and Mismanagements, and proposing Plans of Improve 
ment, Redress and Reformation. These will do good. This is the 
Way to have things go right; for Officers to correspond constantly 
with Congress and communicate their Sentiments freely. 

McNeal, I suppose, by his Letter, before this, has sailed 4 and 
I hope your Embargo is off, before now, that the Privateers may 
have fair Play. Indeed I am sorry it was ever laid. I am against

all Shackles upon Trade. Let the Spirit of the People have its own 
Way, and it will do something. I doubt much whether you have 
got an hundred Soldiers the more for your Embargo, and perhaps 
you have missed Opportunities of taking many Prizes and several 
Hundreds of Seamen. 

South Carolina seems to display a Spirit of Enterprize in Trade 
superior to any other State. They have Salt at half a Dollar a 
Bushell and dry Goods in great Plenty, tho dear. Many french 
Vessells have arrived there, some Bermudians, and some of their 
own. They have exported their Crop of Indigo and a great deal of 
Rice. They have some Privateers and have made several Prizes. 
Tobacco too begins to be exported in large Quantities from Mary 
land, Virginia and North Carolina. Vessells sell at very high Prices 
in all these States. In short in one more Year I fancy Trade will 
be brisk in every Part of the Continent, except with Us, the De 
struction of whose Fishery has deprived Us of our Staple and left 
Us nothing to export. We must build Ships and cutt Masts and 
take Fish with our Privateers, etc. I am, etc.

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILA., April 17, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, I should before this time have acknowledged 
your Favors of the 2d and 24th of Feb., had I not constantly been 
in the Situation which you represent to be yours in your last of 
the 2d of April. " Something or other has always taken Place to 
call me off." We have for some time past been threatened with an 
Invasion by Sea, and the last Accounts receivd from the Capes 
say, there are nine of the Enemies Ships of War within the River. 
I inclose this day s paper which gives an account of the Misfor 
tune of the Ship Morris and other Intelligence. 

By the last Letters from France dated in February we are in 
formed that a War is inevitable and our Affairs there still wear a 
favorable Aspect. My worthy Friend Dr. L[ee] who you have 
heard is got to Paris writes to me in these Words. "The Politicks 
in Europe depend on too many Whims and Refinements for us to 
hazard the downright Defence of every thing dear to us upon 
them. It is well to cultivate Europe but not to depend upon it." 
He speaks my Sentiments, and, I believe, yours. I have been 
always of Opinion, that we must depend upon our own Efforts 
under God for the Establishment of our Liberties. When it suits 
the interest of foreign Powers they will aid us substantially. That 
some of them will find it their Interest to aid us I can hardly doubt 
but there seems not to be Virtue enough left in the World from 
generous and disinterested Motives to interpose in Support of the 
Common Rights of Mankind. We are told that fresh disputes have 
arisen between Russia and the Turks and a Quarrel is likely to 
ensue. France and Spain are preparing mighty Fleets to consist 
of thirty Sail of the Line each and to be ready for the Sea the 
first of March. The Merchants of Britain in a Memorial laid be 
fore Lord Sandwich reckon their Losses by the Captures our Pri 
vateers have made in their West India Trade to be 1,800,000.

Insurance had arisen to 28 pr. ct. and Bankruptcys had taken 
place. There is no kind of Relaxation here, says a London Corre 
spondent, in Warlike Preparations, and yet the Ministry have so 
contrivd it that but few People believe there is any Danger of War. 
I am much puzzled, says he, about the real Intention in respect of 
these great and hasty Armaments; they are certainly too expen 
sive to be mere scarecrows, and improbable as on one account it 
seems, there is Reason to believe they intend when their present 
Loan is compleated either to attack France, or at least to hold 
very high Language to her. Certain it is, that Lord Weymouth 
has of late seriously and warmly urgd an immediate Declaration 
of War with France, and tho such Declaration has not been made 
it is perhaps only suspended. With regard to America we are in- 
formd that Transports were getting ready to bring out the addi 
tional British and Hessian Troops and it was intended they should 
all sail by the beginning of March. The Campaign is to be opend 
unusually early and the Operations directed wholly and from all 
sides against New England, that by early and vigorous Exertions 
they may crush the Northern Colonies. 

1 think I have given this to you and my other Friends as my 
opinion in my Letters the last Winter. If they can subdue those 
stubborn States, they flatter themselves the rest will submit. It 
is necessary that New England should sustain her Character and 
Firmness. Their Intention is to extirpate the People there and 
make Slaves of the rest of America. I wish the Nest of Hornets on 
Rhode Island had been before now destroyd. I expected it would 
have been done. I have been informd of the Reason why it was 
not done. The Congress have now recommended it to the States 
of Massachusetts] B[ay], Connecticut] and R[hode] I[sland], to 
call forth their Militia for that Purpose and have directed Genl. 
Washington to send a suitable Officer to take the Command. 1 I 
hope it will now be done. It is certainly wise to conquer our Ene 
mies in Detail before their Reinforcements can arrive. I fear N.E. 
will be chargd with the Loss of her former military Pride if it is not 
done. I have been sanguine in urging it here and have almost 
pawnd my Reputation on the Success of the Undertaking as well

in New England. 

Capt. Collins who will deliver this Letter is now ready to set 
off and waits. Adieu, my Friend. I will speak to Genl. Mifflin

hear of the brisk Sale of Lottery Ticketts in Boston and that the 
Loan office is successfull. I hope Boston will be made as strong

them here beyond bearing.

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 

BOSTON, April 23d, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, I have been very unwell and absent for a fort 
night. I returned here yesterday. While I was at home I had the 
great pleasure of receiving several of your favours, perticularly 
those of March 31, April ist and 3d, with the inclosures, and 
since my return yours by Capt. Arnold of the 6th Instant. I think 
myself greatly obliged to you for the entertainment as well as 
intelligence and information derived from them, as these have all 
come safe I regret the loss of that that you say contained the bold 
truths. 

I am pleased to see our affairs in so good a way. I think a war in 
Europe must soon take place. It is impossible that under all cir 
cumstances it should even by the meanness of Britain be prevented, 
and if our Army is obtained, with the powder and arms sent us by 
the kindness of Providence, I believe we shall be ready and able 
to fight Britain with or without a war in Europe, especially if 
their funds begin to fall. Almost every thing is done to fill up the

Army, and since the arrival of the arms here they are all on the 
march. On Sunday last arrived here a french ship loaded with 
goods, on account of private adventurers. Her cargo is very valu 
able and consists of some articles much wanted. Arms she has a 
few, and has 5000 blankets. She is armed with [ ] guns, has a 
Commission to make reprisals if disturbed, and the super cargo is 
ready to take Continental Bills. I begin to be very easy about 
their credit, and to conceive they will be as valuable as silver. 

We had last Sunday a prize brought into Plymouth. She was 
bound to Antigua with a load of beef and butter, and last evening 
I heard of the arrival of another at Cape Ann, with 2000 bbs. beef 
and pork. I suppose she was bound to York. The amazing damage 
we should have done them, as well as the advantages derived to 
ourselves, make me execrate the policy of stopping our privateers. 
I always opposed it. We have now got a resolve passed to let them 
loose on conditions they will cruise with Manly under his com 
mand twenty-five days. 1 Perhaps we shall make a fleet of ten or 
twelve sail of them soon and some of them 20 Gun Ships. We hope 
by this to sweep one of their fleets, and to do great execution. We 
have for encouragement engaged an indemnification for losses 
which prizes are not sufficient for. I can easily conceive we might 
have had a fine fleet of our own by this time. Our frigates in con 
cert might have taken several of theirs, that have for the most part 
cruised single. Your ships are however in harbour here, but it is 
said have consented to sail together. Last evening the Board of 
War received an express from Cape Ann, that the Milford and a 
tender were yesterday nigh there and took a Schooner. They are 
endeavouring to get out Manly and McNeal to take her. 2 

We are sending in a reinforcement of 2000 men to Rhode Island 
a draft from the Militia for two months. 3 What the state of the 
enemy is there I am not able to say. I believe their land force is 
inconsiderable. I was told yesterday not more than 1400. I wish

your ships at Providence were out. there is no difficulty in effect 
ing it, and I wish the troops on the Island whether 1400 or 4000 
were driven of. I think there is no difficulty in effecting that. 
The Honour of New England is concerned in this matter and men 
enough for such an enterprize might be had at once. They must, 
however, be Militia, and the estimation of them runs very low with 
our Military Gentry who have forgot from whence they came, and 
of what materials they are now some of them half formed. This is 
to go by Capt. Ayres, 1 who informed me yesterday of his design to 
set out this morning. I dont know his business but I suppose to 
apply for some appointment in the Navy. I have not much ac 
quaintance with him. He seems to be an active smart man, has 
been long at sea, and as he has commanded one of your Schooners 
with reputation, I could wish he might succeed. I am Yours, etc.

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 

BOSTON, April 27th, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, Since I wrote you by the post on last Thurs 
day, nothing very material has taken place here. Two Frigates 
have for some time been infecting our coasts a species of insult 
that has ever gauled me, and more especially since we had Ships 
sufficient either to take or drive them off, lying in our harbours for 

1 John Ayres, commander of the Continental vessel, the Lynch. 

2 Du Coudray and his party. Lists are in Journals of the Continental Congress, vin. 606, 



Warren- Adams Letters 319 

months sufficient to build and equip a large fleet. The ships now 
on the coast have taken several vessels mostly small ones. One of 
them they gave their prisoners and sent them on shore with a 
message and challenge to Manly and McNeil and all the armed 
vessels in this harbour. This has roused the indignation of the 
officers and tarrs, united their wishes with ours, and given us an 
opportunity which many of us thought should not be neglected. 
We accordingly appointed a Committee J to confer with your 
Captain and Agents, and to treat and contract with the owners 
and commanders of private vessels to go to sea and meet the chal 
lengers. We have by lending money toManley and McNeil satis 
fied them. We have contracted for two or three 2O-Gun Ships, 
and six or seven smaller ones, to be ready to sail on the first day of 
May and to continue with, and be under the command of Manly 
for twenty-five days, we insuring the owners against loss and dam 
ages, giveing the men a month s pay, and puting them on your 
Establishment in case they loose life or limbs. With these a num 
ber of others will go, and agree to continue under the Commo 
dore s command for the same time for the sake of getting out. If 
we don t meet the ships we shall get the Continental Ships, and the 
privateers to sea, instead of detaining them here by an Embargo 
against all good policy. It will be therefore a great point gained. 
I hope Congress will approve the measure, and refund the ex- 
pences. 

I have been several times in company with the Colonel 2 who 
came into Portsmouth in the ship lately arrived there, and am 
much pleased with him. He is sensible and polite, has a fine 
appearance, and every air and manner of a Soldier; he is an Irish 
man brought up in France from his youth, and talks pretty good 
English. He is modest, but if I have any skill in physiognomy will 
fight. He says he is determine[d] to deserve any thing you give 
him, will not serve under the Baron de Bore who arrived in the 
first ship, had rather be a drummer under an American officer. 

I hope the Court will rise this week and give me a little respite

and time to study Tull; but after all our study, I don t know but 
Mrs. Adams native genius will excel us all in husbandry. She was 
much engaged when I came along, and the farm at Braintree ap 
peared to be under excellent management. I tryed to persuade her 
to make a visit to her friend Mrs. Warren, but she can t leave home 
this Busy Season. 

I could wish the Agents you may send here to purchase cloath- 
ing or other necessaries for the Army may be instructed not to 
violate our Laws, assume too great a superiority, or interfere with 
our Board of War, who are really agents for you without commis 
sions or pay, and do business for you in the best manner. This 
wish is suggested to me by an altercation now subsisting between 
some of them and the Board, who shall purchase the cargo of the 
French-man lately arrived here, tho the Board of War had engaged 
what they chose to take and have offered the Agents every article 
they may want. Such things may give the French an ill opinion 
of us. My regards to all Friends. I am as usual yours, etc.

I thank you for your two letters of the 6th of April which came 
safe to hand. I am glad to hear you have it in contemplation to 
put your Naval Affairs on a better footing. I have not the least 
difficulty in supposing that they would have made a very different 
figure in other hands. The selfishness and incapacity you mention 
are well placed, and have injured them much. 

Livingston l and Turnbul, 2 two young gentlemen, are employed 
here by your secret Committee to purchase cloathing etc. they in 
form me they are going to return soon, and expect there will be a 
new appointment in their room. Would it not be better to appoint 
some person here. Mr. Otis 3 on the Committee of Cloathing, last 
fall, procured and sent forward great quantities of cloathing for 
the Army. If agreable to you I could wish you would mention him 
to that Committee. He has by his conduct on that Committee 
and the services he did the Army deserved the appointment.

I intended this for a short letter, but I always fill the paper when 
I write to you. I want to see some resentment shown to the Portu- 
guees. It wont perhaps do to declare war against them or to make 
captures of their Ships, for they do only what they cant help; but 
an interdiction of commerce with them made in the stile of the 
high and mighty States of America might, as Carmichael 1 hints, 
have an happy effect.

MY DEAR SIR, - Yours of April 3d I reed. I must confess, that 
I am at a Loss to determine whether it is good Policy in Us to wish 
for a War between France and Britain, unless We could be sure 
that no other Powers would engage in it: But if France engages 
Spain will, and then all Europe will arrange themselves on one 
side and the other and what Consequences to Us might be involved 
in it I don t know. If We could have a free Trade with Europe I 
should rather run the Risque of fighting it out with George and 
his present Allies, provided he should get no other. I don t love 
to be intangled in the Quarrels of Europe. I don t wish to be under

Obligations to any of them, and I am very unwilling they should 
rob Us of the Glory of vindicating our own Liberties. 

It is a Cowardly Spirit in our Countrymen, which makes them 
pant with so much longing Expectation, after a French War. I 
have very often been ashamed to hear so many Whiggs groaning 
and Sighing with Despondency and whining out their Fears that 
We must be subdued unless France should step in. Are We to be 
beholden to France for our Liberties? France has done so much 
already that the Honour and Dignity and Reputation of Great 
Britain is concerned to resent it, and if she does not, France will 
trifle with her forever hereafter. She has reed, our Ambassadors, 
protected our Merchant Men, Privateers, Men of War and Prizes, 
admitted Us freely to trade, lent Us Money, and supplied Us with 
Arms, Ammunition and Warlike Stores of every Kind. This is 
notorious all over Europe, and she will do more, presently, if our 
dastardly Despondency, in the midst of the finest Prospects im 
aginable, does not discourage her. The surest and the only Way 
to secure her Arms in this Cause is for Us to exert our own. For 
God s sake then don t fail of a single Man of your Quota. Get 
them at any Rate, and by any Means rather than not have them. 

I am more concerned about our Revenue than the Aid of France. 
Pray let the Loan Offices do their Part, that We may not be com 
pelled to make Paper Money as plenty and of Course as cheap as 
Oak Leaves. There is so much Injustice in carrying on a War with 
a depreciating Currency that We can hardly pray with Confidence 
for success. 

The Confederation has been delayed because the States were 
not fully represented. Congress is now full, and We are in the 
Midst of it. It will soon be passed. 

God prosper your new Constitution. But I am afraid you will 
meet the Disapprobation of your Constituents. It is a Pity you 
should be obliged to lay it before them; it will divide and distract 
them. However, their Will be done; if they suit themselves they 
will please me. Your Friend.

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 

BOSTON, May 5, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, We have no late arrivals, no foreign intelli 
gence, the affair of Danbury has wholly engrossed the conversa 
tion here for a week past, and we were never able to determine 
whether what we heard was true or false, or even that there had 
been an expedition there till yesterday, when we were beyond a 
doubt ascertained of the loss of the stores there, and the indelible 
stigma fixed on the N. England Militia by the Cowardly conduct 
of the Connecticut men. 1 Had these men never the Lexington and 
Bunker Hill spirit, or have they been laughted out of it by our 
Continental regulars, and made to believe they can t fight? If 
they won t fight what have we to depend on here but Miracles, for 
we have nothing else, and here it is said is to be the campaign. My 
superiour officer in the Militia 2 you retain at the head of the Su- 
preem Legislative; the next to me you have advanced to a more 
important station. I am therefore left alone, and find the misfor 
tune of being ranked with important folks. The Militia is so de 
spised, and I suppose is designed with all its officers to be directed 
by Continental Generals, that I intend to embrace the first oppor 
tunity to quit it, that shall offer without any imputation. The late 
intelligence alone has prevented. We have lately ordered 1,500 
Militia from the County of Hampshire to Ticonderoga; one half 
of the County of Berkshire are gone to Albany at the desire of 
General Gates; two thousand men are ordered and most of them 
marched to reinforce the State of Rhode Island. We have voted 
the same bounty to the Regiments of Lee, Henley, and Jackson, 
before given to the 1 5 Battalions. We have ventured on a draft on 
such of our Towns as have not already inlisted a number aequal to 
I /7th part of all their Male Inhabitants from sixteen and upwards, 
to be made on the I5th of this month, and now must raise some 
Regiments for the defence of this Harbour, or leave it defenceless. 
If we do all this, if our Board of War deals out the stores they 
collect as fast as they come in to the Army, if we strip our beds of 
blankets, and our backs of cloaths for them, if we suffer all our

provisions to be purchased for them, in short, if for the good of the 
whole we are contented to be naked, cold, hungry, and defenceless, 
will the Southern Gentry give us credit, and call us good fellows? 
Or will they say we are selfish and provideing for a Seperate Inter 
est, which I have it hinted to me is the case ? Some people employed 
here have done more hurt than good. 

I suppose the Court will rise tomorrow. You will next hear from 
me at Plymouth, where I long to be to set out a few trees, etc., 
to flourish in the age of peace and happiness. Since my last I am 
to thank you for yours of the 1 6th April. I have a great curiosity 
to know what operation the turn of our affairs last winter will have 
in Europe. I yesterday wrote to the General, and gave him a detail 
of the situation of things here, and the motives we have acted from. 
If he has any confidence in me he will entertain no prejudices 
against us. 1 If N England is to be the scene of action, are no troops 
to be sent here? I am called and must conclude. Please to give 
my regards to my Friends, and inform Mr. Adams that his account 
is past, and a grant for his services up to August last. Perhaps 
he should send an order to receive it, if his Lady has not one. I 
am as usual your Sincere Friend, etc.

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 2 

PHILADELPHIA, May 6, 1777 

DEAR SIR, About Ten Days ago I had the Boldness to make 
a Motion that a Navy Board should be established at Boston. 
Certain Gentlemen looked struck and surprised; however, it 
passed. 3 I have moved I believe fifteen Times, that a Nomina 
tion should take Place; certain Gentlemen looked cold. 

Two or three Days ago, the Nomination came on. Langdon, 
Vernon, Deshon, Dalton, Orne, Henley, Smith, Cushing and 
Warren, were nominated. 

_i _ Washington s reply, May 23, 1777, is in Writings of Washington (Ford), v. 379. The 
original letter, written by Hamilton, but signed by Washington, is in the Warren Papers. 
_ 2 Although this letter is printed in the Works of John Adams, ix. 464, it is reprinted as 
it gives the reasons for appointing Warren to the Navy Board. 

3 Journals of the Continental Congress, vn. 281. The resolution was adopted April 19. 



I???] Warren- Adams Letters 325 

This Day the Choice came on. At last Vernon, Warren, and 
Deshon were chosen. The Board are to appoint their own Clerk 
who is to have 500 Dollars a year. I hope you will engage in this 
Business and conduct it with Spirit. You cannot be Speaker and 
do this Duty too I believe. 

I think the Town of Boston will be offended. But I could not 
help it. This you will not mention. The Salary for the Commis 
sioners is 1500 Dollars a Year. You will have the Building and 
fitting of all Ships, the appointment of Officers, the Establishment 
of Arsenals and Magazines, etc., which will take up your whole 
Time. But it will be honourable to be so capitally concerned in 
laying a Foundation of a great Navy. The profit to you will be 
nothing, But the Honour and the Virtue the greater. I almost 
envy you this Employment. I am weary of my own and almost 
with my Life. But I ought not to be weary in endeavoring to do well.

BOSTON, May 8th, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, I wrote to you a letter which will accompany 
this with a design it should have gone by last Monday s post, 
but he gave me the slip. Nothing very material has occured since. 
We had yesterday very agreeable accounts of a late Action in the 
Jersies. If it proves true, it is a good beginning. Our Fleet is still 
in the harbour. We have had easterly winds and thick weather 
almost constantly for a fortnight past. They were to sail this day, 
if possible, but there is no alteration in the weather. Three Cruis 
ers chased a Vessel between the Capes yesterday. The intelligence 
from Halifax is that eight sail of their Ships and some small Ves 
sels are between that place and this, that the topic of conversation 
among the officers is the attack on Boston, and the manner how, 
etc. The Court is still setting but will rise to night or tomorrow. 
We have voted the Bounty, etc., to two Battalions of Lee and 
Jackson, the same as the other fifteen. This makes the Bounty 
to be given to eighteen Battalions. We have established or 
voted a Regiment of the Train, and two others for the defence of 



326 Warren- Adams Letters [1777 

Boston, the first for three year twenty dollar Bounty, the others 
for one year with ten dollars. I won t tell you the present state 
of Boston till my next. The long experience of the people here, the 
intelligence they have from the Southward of the enmity and con 
spiracies of the Tories, and the expectation of an attack here have 
wrought them up to such a pitch that a seperation seems neces 
sary. We have passed a Bill for that purpose. Each Town are to 
meet and in public meeting form a List of such as are Inimical, 
and supposed dangerous to choose thirteen of a Committee to Try 
them, and if that is the Judgment send them to the Board of War 
who are to provide Vessels and transport them Immediately. If 
they return they are to be hanged. This Bill is before the Council. 
If it passes there and the business is not done, it will not be the 
fault of the Court, the people must blame themselves. My regards 
to all friends. I am, Yours Assuredly.

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 

BOSTON, June 5th, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, You will perhaps wonder that you have not 
heard from me for so long a time. I have had so little time at home 
of late, and found so much to do there, that I did not attend Elec 
tion, and returned to this town not before yesterday. On my way 
I had the pleasure to find Mrs. Adams and family well. I left 
Mrs. Warren to spend this week with her friends at Braintree. I 
dare say every hour of it will be improved and enjoyed. While 
at home I had the pleasure of your several favours of April 29, 
May 2, 3, and 6. I have now the pleasure of informing you that 
the draft on the several towns to compleat our quota has succeeded 
beyond my expectations, and I hope soon to have our whole num 
ber in Camp, some of them however will not be for three years. 
When I came to Town it was with a full determination not to act 
as Speaker; but I was forced to accept for a few days, so that I have 
not had time to make such enquiry into the state of this matter as 
I could wish. I will inform you more perticularly in my next. In 



i?77] Warren- Adams Letters 327 

the mean time I hope the result of our exertions will rescue you 
from the pain of enduring more reflections on your Constituents. 
We always meant well, and if our policy had been equal to the 
goodness of our intentions, we should have done better than we 
have; but as it is have we not done better than those who abuse 
us for not doing more. I should be glad to know the state of the 
Quotas in the southern states. If I have a right notion of them, and 
don t flatter myself too much with the present state of our own, 
you may revenge yourself at pleasure. I am told now that General 
Washington s Army is in a good state. I think there can t be less 
than 7,000 of our men gone and most of them in Camp. We had 
however yesterday an extract of a letter from Poor at Ti., for 
warded by Gov. Trumbull, letting us know that the Enemy were 
approaching and the Garrison weak, which is to me unaccountable. 
However the Hampshire Militia was in soon after, and with other 
Troops I hope will be an effectual relief. The letter is committed 
and perhaps something more will be done. I intended to have 
enlarged a little but have been interrupted. I can now only express 
my obligations for the late instance of your friendship. I have had 
yet no other notice of the appointment you mention but from com 
mon report. It appears to me to be a business of some magnitude, 
and I have taken such a lurch lately for a more private way of life 
that I am undetermined what I shall do. I am told here that an 
actual residence in Boston is required. If so I must of course ex 
cuse myself, as I should be loath to move from and loose my inter 
est in my native Town and County. I am however very glad there 
is a Board established; never such a thing was wanted more. It 
gives universal Satisfaction; every body applauds the measure. 
If I undertake it, I shall exert myself to do as much honour to 
your Nomination as I am able. We have a House of one-half new 
Members : the upper Counties are largely represented, more than 
60 already returned from the County of Worcester. They come 
high charged and yesterday moved for a repeal of the Act for a 
more equal representation. They did not however carry it. Some 
of them had patience to wait till a Constitution was formed. 
Adew.

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, June n, 1777 

MY DEAR SiRj The honourable Samuel [Joseph] Hewes, Esqr, 1 
a Delegate in Congress from North Carolina from 1774 to 1777, 
being bound on a Journey, to Boston for the Recovery of his 
Health, I do myself the Honour to introduce him to you. 

He has a large share in the Conduct of our naval and commercial 
affairs, having been a member of the naval and marine Commit 
tees, and of the Secret Committee from the first. 

I wish you would be kind enough to introduce him to some of 
our best Company, and give him a line to Dr. Winthrop, that he 
may have an opportunity of seeing the curiosities of Harvard 
Colledge. I have not time to write the Doctor. 

What Mr. Howe s present Plan is no Conjurer can discover. He 
is moving and maneuvring with his Fleet and Army, as if he had 
some Design, or other, but what it may be no Astrologer can divine. 
It is disputed among the Writers, upon military Science, whether 
a Faculty of penetrating the Intentions of an Enemy, or that of 
acquiring the Love of his Soldiers is the first Quality of a General. 
But whether this Penetration holds the first or second Place, it 
cannot discover Designs that are not, and Schemes that were never 
laid. Howe s behaviour Strongly indicates a Want of System. 

Some conjecture he is bound to the West Indies, others to 
Europe; one Party to Hallifax, another to Rhode Island. This 
set sends him up the North River, that down the East River and 
the other up the Delaware. I am weary of Conjectures. Time will 
solve them. 

One thing is certain, that in the Jersies his whole Army was 
seized with Terror and Amazement. The Jersey Militia, have done 
themselves, the highest Honour, by turning out in such great 
Numbers, and with such Determined Resolution. This was alto 
gether unexpected to the British and Hessian Gentry. They were 
persuaded that the People, would be on their side, or at least 
inactive; but when they found Hundreds, who had taken their 
Protection, and their oaths of allegiance, in Arms, against them,

and with terrible Imprecations, vowing Vengeance, their Hearts 
sank within them and they sneaked away in a Panic. This Militia, 
was dismissed too soon, and they took advantage of it, to come 
out, again with their whole Army upon a predatory Expedition, 
but soon returned, and evacuated New Jersey altogether. 

I am most apprehensive they will go to Rhode Island. If not, I 
think, unless they have prepared Reinforcements with such Secrecy 
that no Intimations of them have reached us, they will give us 
but a languishing and inactive Campaign. 

I hope you proceed, in the Formation of a Constitution without 
any hurtfull Divisions, or Altercations. Whatever] the Majority 
determine, I hope the Minority will cheerfully concur in. The 
fatal Experience of Pennsylvania, has made me dread nothing so 
much as Disunion, upon this Point. God grant you may lay the 
Foundations of a great, wise, free and honourable People.

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
BOSTON, June nth, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, It is a long time since I have had- the pleasure 
of a line from you. I looked for one last post, and was disappointed. 
I wrote to you by the Thursday post, since which nothing of con 
sequence has taken place here. A number of Men of War are 
cruiseing on our Coast and three or four of them in our Bay. I 
suppose their design is [to] get our frigates, and to intercept the 
prizes taken by the Privateers lately sailed. I fear they will succeed 
too well in the last, if not in the first. Where Manly and McNeil are 
we don t hear, but I am in some pain for them. I am sorry to 
hear there is any difficulty in Gates haveing the command of the 
Northern Army. Will not this produce a resignation and some 
confusion in our affairs. Besides I have no notion of a General who 
is not on the spot, and to fight if there be occasion. Our Expedi 
tion some time ago recommended by Congress has fallen through 
in a strange manner. I can give you no account of this event, but 
from a want of spirit and activity. When I left Boston I supposed 
it was to be executed in a short time, but now I hear nothing of it. 



330 Warren- Adams Letters [1777 

The whole matter was left with our Council and they were vested 
with powers accordingly. They perhaps can give a reason. The 
Enemy at this time have but a small force, and I think might with 
the greatest ease be driven off in the course of ten days from this 
moment; but there is no General sent as mentioned, and nothing 
can be done without a Continental General. Their holding this 
Post at a time when they so much want reinforcements to their 
main Army is the only circumstance that looks like an invasion of 
N. England. What their movements will be, seems to us very 
uncertain here. It is generally believed their reinforcements will 
fall much short of their expectations, but we want some fresh 
intelligence from Europe. Every thing we do hear looks like a 
French War. I never wish to be beholden to any other Power but 
that of Heaven, and to our own virtue and valour for our Liberties ; 
but it seems to me a war between France and England will make 
a diversion very favourable to us. At least it will Gratifie my 
resentment and curiosity. I wish to see Britain distressed and 
reduced to circumstances that shall make her appear ridiculous 
and contemptible to herself, and I have a curiosity to see. the 
operation and the event. 

Your Loan Office in this State I am informed succeeds well. I 
hope our money has got to its lowest ebb. I think our regulating 
Act has among other evils injured our Currency by introducing 
barter, etc.; but our House have after a long debate and a torrent 
of eloquence and wisdom (for we have eloquent and wise folks 
among us who affect great sublimity in both without decision), 
determined against a repeal 122 to 31. We seem generally agreed 
on a large Tax not less than 1 50. perhaps 2OO,ooo. If the other 
N.E. states would tax in the same proportion, our money would 
soon be on a better footing: pray let me hear from you. I want to 
have intelligence from Europe, to hear how your Confederation, 
etc., go on, and how your health is. I wish you happiness and am, 
Yours, etc. 

[No signature.] 

Mrs. Warren desires compliments and best wishes to Mr. Adams. 

My regards to Mr. Adams. I will write him soon, tho he has 
almost dropped the correspondence.

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADA., June 18, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, This Letter will be delivered to you by my 
worthy Friend, Colo. Whipple, 1 a Delegate of the State of New 
Hampshire. He is a Gentleman of Candor, and I wish he may 
have an opportunity of conversing freely with some one of Influ 
ence in the Massachusetts Bay upon Matters which concern that 
State particularly. I know of no one to whom I can recommend 
him on this Occasion with more Propriety than to yourself. He 
will be able to give you such Information of Persons and Things 
as one would not chuse to throw on Paper in this precarious Time, 
when an Accident might turn the Intelligence into a wrong 
Channel. 

I observe by the Boston Papers last brought to us, that you are 
again plac d in the Chair of the House of Representatives, with 
which I am well pleased Mr. Pain Speaker pro Temp., Mr. 
Hancock first Member of the Boston Seat, and Mr. T. Cushing a 
Councellor at large. I have the Honor of knowing but few of your 
Members. I hope my Countrymen have been wise in their Elec 
tions, and I pray God to bless their Endeavors for the Establish 
ment of publick Liberty, Virtue and Happiness. 

You will hear before this will reach you of the Movements of 
the Enemy. It has been the general Opinion for some Months 
past that Philadelphia is their Object. Should they gain this 
Point, what will it avail them, unless they beat our Army? This I 
think they will not do. My Wish is that our Army may beat them, 
because it would, in my opinion, put a glorious End to the Cam 
paign, and very probably the War. I confess I have always been 
so very wrong headed as not to be over well pleased, with what is 
called the Fabian War in America. I conceive a great difference 
between the situations of the Carthaginian and the British Gen 
erals. But I have no Judgment in Military Matters, and therefore 
will leave the Subject to be discussed, as it certainly will be, by 
those who are Masters of it. 

I cannot conclude this Letter without thanking you for your 

I William Whipple (1730-1785).

Care in carrying a Matter in which I was interested through the 
General Assembly, of which I have been informed by our Friend 
Mr. J. A. I wish to hear from you. Adieu, my Friend.

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, June 19, 1777 

DEAR SIR, Yours of the 5th inst. is before me. It may be 
very true, that your Regiments are as full, as those of any other 
State; but none of yours were so early in the Field, and we must, 
not flatter ourselves with the Reflection that ours are as full as 
others. When many Daughters do virtuously, we must excell them 
all. We are the most powerfull State. We are so situated as to 
obtain the best Intelligence. We were first in this Warfare: and 
therefore We must take the Lead, and set the Example the others 
will follow. 

The Armies at Ti and in the Jersies begin to be very respectable: 
but not one half so numerous as they ought to be. We must not 
remit our Exertions. 

You must not decline your Appointment to the Navy Board. 
If you should, I know not who will succeed. Congress have passed 
no order for a constant Residence at Boston. No doubt the most 
of your Time will be taken up at Boston, but you need not renounce 
your Native Town and County. It is a- Board of very great 
Importance. I hope your Commissions and Instructions will be 
soon forwarded. The Cause of their Delay so long is the same, I 
suppose, that has retarded all other marine affairs Causes, 
which it would be thought inexpedient to explain. 

I am very sorry to see in the Papers, the Appearance of Dissen 
sions between the General Court and the Town of Boston, and to 
learn from private Letters, that there are Divisions between the 
Eastern and Western Part of our Commonwealth. I wish to know, 
the Run of the Instructions from the Towns, on the Subject of a 
Constitution, and whether you are in a way to frame one. Surely 
the longer this Measure is delayed, the more difficult it will be to 
accomplish. The Rage of Speculation, Improvement and Refine- 



i?77] IVarren- Adams Letters 333 

ment is unbounded, and the longer it is suffered to indulge itself 
the wilder it will grow. 

I am much mortified that our State have neglected so long, to 
Number their Regiments, and to send us a List of them and of all 
their officers. We loose one half the Reputation, that is due to us, 
for want of a little Method and Regularity, in Business. 

We are much embarrassed here, with foreign officers. 1 We have 
three capital Characters here, Monsr. de Coudray, General Con- 
way, and Monsr De la Balme. These are great and learned Men. 
Coudray is the most promising officer in France. Coudray is an 
officer of Artillery, Balme of Cavalry, and Conway of Infantry. 
Coudray has cost us dear, his Terms are very high, but he has done 
us such essential service in France, and his Interest is so great and 
so near the Throne, that it would be impolitick, not to avail our 
selves of him. 

I live here at an Expence, that will astonish my Constituents, 
and expose me, I fear to Reflections. I spend nothing myself, I 
keep no Company, and I live as simply, as any Member of your 
Houses, without Exception. But my Horses are eating their 
Heads off, and my own and servants Board are beyond any Thing 
you can concieve. I would have sold my Horses and sent home 
my servant, but we have been every Moment in Expectation of 
the Enemy to this Town, which would oblige me to move and in 
that Case such Confution would take Place, and such a Demand 
for Horses to remove Families and Effects into the Country, that 
I should not be able to obtain one to ride fifty Miles for Love nor 
Money. 

I have not made, and I can t make an exact Computation; but 
I don t believe, my bare Expences, here, if I should stay with my 
servant and Horses the whole year will amount to less than two 
Thousand Dollars. If my Constituents are startled at this, I can 
not help it, they must recall me. 

We are in hourly Expec[ta]tion of momentous intelligence, from 
every Quarter. Heaven grant it may be prosperous and pleasing.

Washington (Ford), v. 369, 403; Ballagh, Letters of Richard Henry Lee, i. 293.

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 

BOSTON, June 22d, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, If any conjecture may be formed from the 
intelligence or rather reports prevailing here you may leave 
Philadelphia before this letter will get there. It is said the Britons 
are determined at all events to attempt that City, and I presume 
the discretion and wisdom of your Body will induce you to decamp 
and retire, before the Siege commences, if our Army is in the situa 
tion we are told it is. I wish one side or the other would open the 
Campaign. I long to hear of enterprizes, of battles fought and vic 
tories gained on our side; but our intelligence about the Army and 
every thing else to the Southward is of late miserably deficient 
and uncertain. Do you recollect that you, on whom I principally 
depend (because you used to write me often and give me much 
intelligence), have missed four or five posts and that in that time 
I have wrote you several letters? I intended home tomorrow or 
next day, but believe I shall wait till Thursday in hopes of letters 
from you and my other friends. If I fail I shall be disappointed. 
All things remain here pretty much in the same situation as when 
I last wrote you. The regulateing Act has been the subject of fre 
quent and tedious debates, and it yet remains undetermined by 
the House whether to repeal, inforce, or suspend it for a time. 
While the people abroad pay very little or no regard to it, the only 
notice taken of it is the continual disputes and execrations that 
meet us in every company. The prevailing sentiment in the op 
position seems to be for a suspension and let it die in some sort 
by the authority of Government a lingering death. We have now 
a Committee for reporting a Constitution. They have met several 
times, and are well agreed as to the main points in the Connecticut 
Form. I conceive the matter of Representation will be our greatest 
difficulty. They have agreed on the qualification of Electors, that 
they should be Freemen of 21 years of age, resident for a certain 
time in each Town, and such as have paid publick Taxes. I could 
wish that .a certain degree of property had been another; but as it 
is to have the sanction of the people at large I question whether 
that would not render the whole abortive, and from that principle 



i?77] Warren- Adams Letters 335 

have conceded to it as it is. What number of Electors is to intitle 
a Town to one Representative or more is the next question not 
yet settled. Tho we have the advantage of a Member of Congress 
on this Committee, I am never with them but I wish you was one 
of us. We want you much. This is a subject of such a magnitude 
and extent that I feel myself very unequal to, and in want of the 
judgment and wisdom of those who I have the greatest confidence 
in and opinion of instead of the narrow sentiments, trite trifling, 
and sometimes ludicrous observations of those whose abilities and 
judgments I despise. I guess at your curiosity with regard to a 
Certain Member and wish to gratify it; but letters have been 
intercepted and may be again you will therefore excuse me. I hope 
your next will contain some observations on a form of Government 
for this State. They would be seasonable at this time. 

We have had a Bill before us for freeing the Negroes, which is 
ordered to lie, least if passed into an Act it should have a bad 
effect on the Union of the Colonies. A letter to Congress on that 
subject was proposed and reported, but I endeavoured to divert 
that, supposeing it would embarrass and perhaps be attended with 
worse consequences than passing the Act. All our other business 
I can now mention is of smaller consequence and in the common 
course. 

As to news we have very little of late. There are a number of 
Cruisers on our Coast who have taken divers vessels, and two days 
ago drove ashore on the back of the Cape a Brigantine belonging 
to this State from the West Indies with 80 bbl. powder, 500 Arms, 
some duck and salt, etc., which they took possession of; when the 
inhabitants mustered and marched down to the shore with a piece 
of cannon, upon which they left her and cargo which was all ex 
cept a few trifles saved. We hear nothing lately from Manly and 
McNeil. It is said eight frigates are in quest of them. I expect 
they will have a brush before they return. The Alfred remains in 
port, not quite man d, otherways ready to go to sea. Our fleet at 
Providence still shut up. It is said Hopkins is determined to at 
tempt to get out, and it is generally believed he will fail if he does. 
Some prizes are sent in. A vessel arrived here yesterday in eight 
een days from St. Eustatia and brings an account that the Oliver 



336 W^arren- Adams Letters [1777 

Cromwell Privateer of Philadelphia of 24 guns was lately taken by 
a Sloop of War of fourteen. This is an indignity that Oliver never 
suffered. 

I suppose you have reconsidered your Resolve for a Navy 
Board here. We hear nothing of it lately. I am with great Sincerity 

Your Friend, etc.

Mr. Gerry that the Ship expected from Bilboa is not yet arrived. 



SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADA., June 23d, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, I wrote to you a few days ago by Colo. Whip- 
pie, with whom I hope you have had free Conversation. As he 
must have been not far from the Spot, he can give you a more 
particular Account than has yet been handed to us, of the late 
Scituation and Movements of the two Armies. The main Body 
of our Army were encampd at Middlebrook and a considerable 
Force consisting of Continental Troops and Militia lay at a place 
called Sourland Hills within Six Miles of the Enemy, who were 
posted at Somerset Court House, Nine Miles on this side of 
Brunswick. The Right of the Enemy was at Brunswick and their 
Left at Somerset. They were well fortified on the Right, and had 
the Rariton River in Front and Millstone River on the left. In 
this Scituation General Washington thought an Attack upon them 
would not be warranted by a sufficient Prospect of Success and 
might be attended with bad Consequences. His Design was to 
collect all the Forces that could possibly be drawn from other 
Quarters so as to reduce the Security of his Army to the greatest 
Certainty, and to be in a Condition to embrace any fair opportu 
nity that might offer to make an Attack on advantageous Terms. 
In the mean time by light Bodies of Militia seconded and encour 
aged by a few Continental Troops to harrass and diminish their 
Numbers by continual Skirmishes. But the Enemy made a sudden 
Retreat to Brunswick, and from thence with great Precipitation 



H^arren- Adams Letters 337 

to Amboy. All the Continental Troops at Peeks Kill except the 
Number necessary for the Security of the Post were ordered to 
hasten on to the Army in Jersey, and a Part of them had joynd. 
I am not disposd to ascribe great military Skill to General Howe; 
but if he designd to draw the whole of our Forces from the East 
to the West Side of Hudson s River, in order to gain Advantage 
by suddenly crossing the River with his own Army, I cannot but 
hope they will be cut off and his Design frustrated. Great Credit 
is due to the Jersey Militia who have turnd out with Spirit and 
Alacrity. I congratulate you on the Success of our State Vessels 
of War. 

Will you be so kind as to call on Mrs. A. and let her know that 
you have receivd this letter, for she charges me with not writing 
to my Friend so often as she thinks I ought. 

The Watchman tells me it is past twelve o Clock. Adieu, my 
dear Friend.

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADA., June 30, 1777 

DEAR SIR, I have the pleasure of receiving your friendly 
Letter of the i6th Instant, and have little more than time enough 
barely to acknowledge it. There is an unaccountable uncertainty 
in the conducting the Post office. About a month ago I remon 
strated to the Post Master General that the Time allowd the 
Eastern Delegates to answer the Letters they received (being on 
the Monday between the Hours of 9 and 2) was altogether spent 
in Congress, and requested that we might have one Evening for 
the purpose. He granted it, and the Post has been since detaind 
till tuesday Morning. But I am now informd that the former 
Regulation is revivd, for what Reason I know not, and our Let 
ters must be ready at two o Clock. I do assure you I should hardly 
forgive my self, if I could reflect upon my having once neglected 
to write to so valuable a Friend as you. 

You wish to hear "how our Confederation goes on." I do not 
wonder at your Anxiety to have it completed, for it appears to me 



338 Warren- Adams Letters [1777 

to be a Matter of very great Importance. We every now and then 
take it into Consideration, but such a Variety of Affairs have 
demanded the Attention of Congress, that it has been impracti 
cable hitherto to get it through. There are but two or three things 
which in my Opinion will be the Subjects of further Debate, and 
upon these I believe most if not all the Members have already 
made up their Minds. One is, what share of Votes each of the 
States which differ so much in Wealth and Numbers shall have in 
determining all Questions. Much has been said upon this weighty 
Subject, upon the Decision of which the Union of the States and 
the Security of the Liberty of the whole [depend]. Perhaps it 
would be more easy for a disinterested Foreigner to see, than for 
the united States to fix upon the Principles on which this Question 
ought in Equity to be decided. The Sentiments in Congress are 
not various, but, as you will easily conceive, opposite. The Ques 
tion was very largely debated a few days ago, and I am apt to 
think it will be tomorrow determind, that each State shall have one 
Vote, but that certain great and very interesting Questions shall 
have the concurrent Votes of Nine States for a Decision. Whether 
this Composition will go near towards the Preservation of a due 
Ballance, I wish you to consider. For if your Life and Health is 
spared to your Country you will have a great Share in the Deter 
mination of it hereafter. 

You have Advices from abroad later than ours. Our last Intel 
ligence I gave you pretty minutely in a Letter which I sent and 
suppose was deliverd to you by Capt. Collins. 

I find by the Newspapers that the General Assembly under the 
Denomination of a Convention are forming a new Constitution. 
This is a momentous Business; I pray God to direct you! Shall I 
be favord with your own and others Sentiments upon it. I am 
greatly afflicted to find that angry Disputes have arisen among 
my dear Countrymen, at a time especially when perfect good 
Humour should subsist and every Heart and Tongue and Hand 
should unite in promoting the Establishment of publick Liberty 
and securing the future Safety and Happiness of our Country. 
I am sure you will cultivate Harmony among those who love the 
Country in Sincerity. With Regard to others, I will say in the Apos- 



1777] Warren- Adams Letters 339 

tolick Language "I would they were all cut off" (banishd at least) 
"who trouble you." 

Will it too much infringe upon your precious Time, to acquaint 
Mrs. A. that I am in good Health and Spirits; and have not oppor 
tunity to write to her by this Post. I am with the most friendly 
Regards to your Lady and Family, very affectionately, your Friend, 

S. A. 

JOHN ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADELPHIA, July 7, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, Yours of June 22d reed, only today. We have 
no Thoughts of leaving Philadelphia. I believe Howe has no 
Thoughts of attempting it, but if he has We are determined to 
keep it. Our Army, with the assistance of the Militia, will be suffi 
cient to defend it. 

Why our Army fills up no faster I can t conceive. The Massa 
chusetts Regiments at Ti are not one Third full, and We cannot 
learn from Peeks Kill, that Putnam ever had above Six Thousand 
Men, in all, from Mass., Rhode Island, Connecticutt, and New 
York. You must have been deceived in the Numbers inlisted. 

There is a loud Complaint here, about Arms. EighteenThousand 
Arms have arrived at Portsmouth 1 and We know not what be 
comes of them. Other Arms have arrived in Mass., but We know 
not where they are, and it is said the Game Cock carried Six Thou 
sand into Dartmouth. Where are they? 

I wish you Joy of your Employment in making a Constitution, 
hope you will make a good one. I hope to sit quietly under it, 
altho I shall have no hand in forming it. Do you intend to make 
every Man of 21 a Voter for the Council? I have nothing to say, 
but I fear you will find a Fountain of Corruption, in making so 
many Voters. 

The Bill for freeing the Negroes, I hope will sleep for a Time. 
We have Causes enough of Jealousy Discord and Division, and 
this Bill will certainly add to the Number. 

I am weary enough of Complaints, concerning Navy Matters. 

I By the Amphitrite.

I do all I can in public and private to stimulate, but all in vain. 
The Commissions were never sent untill 4 or 5 days ago by Mr. 
Sherman. 1 The Instructions are not sent yet. 2 Who is in Fault, I 
dont say. It is enough for me to answer for my own Faults. 

Is a certain elevated Citizen 3 to put his Hand upon the Pum- 
mell of one Chair, and leap into another, at 370 Miles Distance? 

For my own Part I wish to see Gravity, Wisdom, Constancy and 
Fortitude in every Chair upon the Continent. My Hopes were 
placed upon Mr. B., 4 but his Retirement, has damped if not extin 
guished them. My next Expectations were from the Philosopher. 5 
But I doubt whether the popular Breath, will blow that Way. My 
Wishes, and Judgment are entirely for another. 6 But I know not 
the Chance. 

I should be more anxious about the Chair, if I were to be near 
it. But I pant, and sigh for private Life and rural Felicity. 
Here all my Wishes terminate, and the sooner I reach it, with an 
eternal Renunciation of all Concerns with the public, the better 
for me. An Idol in the Chair that I cannot and will not worship, 
will only facilitate my Progress, to that Condition in human Life, 
where alone I can be happy or even comfortable.

BOSTON, July loth, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, I returned to this Town on Tuesday and found 
the Court had just adjourned to September. Last evening I had 
the pleasure of yours of the I9th June. Am much obliged to you 
for it. It is a rarity being the only one for a month. I hope the 
laudable ambition you so frequently discover for your Country s 
excelling in her exertions for carrying on this war will be gratified. 
I believe we have 8000 already marched, and some more to go. If 
the other States had done as well, we should certainly have had a

more numerous Army in the field. We shall not remit our exertions 
till our Quota is compleat. 

In my last I informed you that we were proceeding on a Consti 
tution of Government, and what kind of a one we were likely to 
have. Very little has been since done as I am told. You must 
know that the Council (of whom several are on the Committee) 
are almost to a man against a new Constitution, and are forced to 
come to it with the greatest reluctance; some of us are lukewarm 
and others consider it as a business by the bye. So the Committee 
is, instead of improveing this interval and going on that business, 
immediately adjourned to the week before the Court meets, so 
that I have a prospect of a little leisure. I shall go home tomorrow, 
and hope to get more than one ramble among the herds at Eal- 
river. The season here is uncommonly fine, there is a profusion of 
grass round this Town the finest crops of hay I have ever seen. 

You need give yourself no concern about any appearance there 
was of disunion between the Town and the Court. It was a sud 
den movement of the Town, from the sudden caprice of a few 
individuals, and seemed to be done without any fixed principles 
against assuming a Constitution, and like most other sudden and 
violent things, very quickly subsided, without leaving so much as 
an appearance of opposition. Nor do I apprehend any danger 
from the other division you mention. Some gentlemen came down 
with a few prejudices against the Tradeing Interest, others with 
very self important notions, and when the first had examined a 
little, and the others had vented themselves, the cloud dispersed 
without much lightning, and no bad effects. 

I will again try to have our Regiments numbered, and to furnish 
you with a list of them and their Officers. I can easily conceive it 
is somewhat embarrassing to have so many foreign officers on your 
lists. It must increase the number of your General officers faster 
than perhaps you inclined. 

Give your self no trouble about the expences of your liveing. 
Your Constituents must be reconciled to it, without recalling you. 
For my own part I wish you to live genteely and in character, cost 
what it will. I am sure I would if I was in your place. Keep your 
servant and your horses. I am sure we should not begrutch you

any thing you incline to eat, drink, or spend. If it should be neces 
sary to make you another grant of money, let me know it, and I will 
endeavour to have it done as soon as we meet. We are not unac 
quainted with extravagancies here. We give five dollars for board, 
etc., which gives us feelings we were not used to. Since my last 
nothing material has turned up in the General Court, nor have we 
any news but from the Jersies and Ti., which you know more about 
than I do. I hope Ti. will be saved. Schuyler must certainly exert 
himself now. He will strain every nerve. Many here are very 
anxious for the fate of that place, but I am not much concerned if 
the Army there do their duty. Where will Howe next bend his 
course? After his late curious expedition and retreat, I think New 
England as probable an object as any. If he comes I hope we shant 
mortifie the pride you have for the reputation of your Country. A 
few prizes drop in and we have another valuable arrival of Arms, 
powder, etc. I suppose Mrs. Adams will herself inform you she is 
well. My regards to Mr. Adams and Gerry and to other friends. 
I shall write them as soon as I have opportunity. With my best 
wishes I am Your Friend, etc.

Let Mr. Gerry know the Ship Lidia is not yet arrived. She left 
Bilboa and was chased into another port by a small English priva

and the Ship releived.

DEAR SIR, We have this moment an account of the Evacua 
tion of Ticonderoga in consequence of a Council of General Offi 
cers, who determined it to be absolutely necessary to save the 
small Army there. 1 This intelligence is by a letter from St. Clair 
to the president of the Convention at Vermont. This letter was 
dated the 7th. He was then on his way to Bennington, and he in 
tended to throw himself on the North River, which as it appears to

of either Army, nor of the loss we sustained; only that he was not 
able to make his retreat with the Stores so perfectly as he could 
have wished, and that there had been a severe Action in the rear, 
the event of which he did not exactly know. I am your Friend,

MY DEAR SIR, I now sit down to write to you in great Haste. 
We have still further but I think confusd Accounts from the North 
ward. Schuyler lays the blame of the Disaster upon Sinclare and 
the General officers. "What could induce them," says he, "to a 
Step that has ruind our Affairs in this Quarter God only knows." 
They impute it to the Want of Men. They say there were but 
about 2000 effective Rank and file; but by the Quartermasters 
Return of the 25 of June, which was ten days before the Evacua 
tion of the Garrison, I assure you there were fit for Duty of the 9

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADA., July 31, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, It is a long time since I had the Pleasure of a 
Letter from you. I have not heard your opinion of the Evacuation 
of T[i]conderoga. You are doubtless as much chagrind as I am. 
It is ascribd to different Causes. Congress is determind that the 
true Reasons shall be enquired into, and the Conduct of the 
General officers. Schuyler s Friends are endeavoring to clear him 
from all Blame, because, say they, he was not there. This is true. 
And as it was well known he had never been used to keep his own 
Person near his Army, perhaps it may be pertinently asked, Why 
he was pitched upon to take the Command. 2 Your Delegates, I 
can assure you, were utterly against it. And, notwithstanding it 
was publishd in one of the Boston News papers, said to be war 
ranted by a Letter from this City, that General Schuyler had the 
entire Confidence of Congress, there were five only of eleven 
States present, in favor of it. The Paper I think was of the 5th of 
June. 3 I wish I could know who gave the Letter to the Printer. 
In order, I suppose, to give Credit to that Letter, there was an 
other Publication in the Papers here, informing the World, that 
when he set off for the Northern Department, he was accompanied 

1 See the letter from Samuel Adams to Richard Henry Lee, July 12, 1777, in Wells, 
Life of Samuel Adams, n. 484. 

2 The Board of War reported in favor of Schuyler, May 15, 1777, but the report was not 
acted upon until May 22. 

3 The extract appeared in the Independent Chronicle, June 12, 1777, and read: "Gen 
eral Schuyler will return to the Northern Department, possessed of the full Confidence of 
Congress, his Conduct has been fully enquired into, and the Congress have given very hon 
orable Proofs of their good opinion of him." The extract was dated May 27.

by the President and other Members of Congress, which I take for 
granted is true. These are trifling political Manuvres similar to 
those which we have formerly seen practicd in the Massachusetts 
Bay, when a Prop was wanted for a sinking Character. You may 
think them not worth your Notice; Excuse my troubling you with 
them. Cunning Politicians often make use of the Names of Per 
sons, and sometimes of the Persons themselves, who have not the 
least Suspicion of it, to serve their own designs. When I mentiond 
five out of Eleven I should have explaind my self. There were five 
States for the Measure, four against it and two divided. Had not 
the State of Rhode Island been at that Juncture accidentally un 
represented, there would have been an equal Division, and the 
Measure would have been prevented. The most important Events 
may sometimes depend upon small Circumstances. Some Gentle 
men of the State of N.Y. are exceedingly attachd to G. Schuyler. 
They represent him as Instar Omnium in the Northern Depart 
ment. After all that has been said, I conceive of him, as I have for 
a long time, excellently well qualified for a Commissary or Quar 
termaster. The N.E. Delegates were (perhaps one excepted) to a 
Man against his having the Command of that Army. But of this 
I will write particularly in another Letter. 

I am not willing to prejudge, but I must say, it is difficult to 
reconcile the sudden Evacuation of Ty. with the previous flatter 
ing Letters of General St. Clare. In one of his Letters written but 
a few days before he says "My People are in the best Disposition 
possible and I have no Doubt about giving a good Account of the 
Enemy if they shall think proper to attack us." He has been es 
teemed here a good officer and in his Letter he bespeaks the 
Candor of the Publick till he can be heard. Pains will be taken to 
lay the Blame upon the N.E. States, for not furnishing their Quota 
of Men. I wish therefore you would procure for me an authentick 
Account of the Number of Men, both regular and Militia sent to 
the Northward from our State, and how they were cloathd and 
armd. You may remember that Congress recommended to the 
Eastern States, some time I think in December last, 1 to send a 

i Journals of the Continental Congress, vi. 1038. The recommendation was passed 
December 24, 1776.

Reinforcement of Militia to Ticonderoga, to remain there till they 
could be replacd by Continental Troops then raising. I have 
never been informd of the Effect of that Recommendation or if 
I have I do not recollect it. Pray put it in our Power to state Facts 
precisely as far as they regard our State. It is agreed on all Sides 
that a Fault lies some where. I hope the Truth will be thoroughly 
investigated, and to use the homely Proverb, the Saddle laid on 
the right Horse. 

We are looking every Moment for the Arrival of the Enemy in 
this River. Two hundred and 55 Sail were seen on Wednesday last 
steering from the Hook South East. Seventy Sail were seen from 
the Shore near Egg Harbour, about 20 Leagues from these Capes, 
on Saturday last steering the same Course. The Wind against 
them. They could not come here at a better time. Genl. W[ashing- 
ton] is drawing his Troops into this Neighborhood. Some of them 
are arrivd. But as the Enemy has the Advantage of us by Sea, it 
is too easy for them to oblige us to harass our Troops by long and 
fruitless Marches; and I should not wonder to hear that they have 
tackd about and gone Eastward. I hope my Countrymen are 
prepared. Let brotherly Love continue. Adieu. Pay my friendly 
Respects to your Lady and family. 1

SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

DEAR SIR, I wrote to you on the 30 Ulto. by Mr. Bruce, who 
did not leave the City on that day as I expected. His stay gives 
me the oppty. of acquainting you that, an Express who left the 
Capes yesterday informs us that the Enemies Ships all went out to 
Sea in the morning steering E.N.E., supposd to be going to Hud 
son s River, Rh. Island, or Boston. Mr. Bruce will give you as 
particular an Acct. as I can; I therefore refer you to him. This is 
what I expected. I trust you are upon your Guard. 

Congress have orderd that an Enquiry be made into the Reasons 
of the Evacuation of Tyconderoga and Mount Independence and 
into the Conduct of the General officers who were in the Northn. 

I Endorsed: favord by Mr. Bruce.

Departmt. at the time of the Evacuation. That Schuyler, St. 
Clair, Poor, 1 Patterson 2 and Roche de Fermoy repair to Head 
Quarters, and that Genl. Washington order such Genl. officers 
as he shall think proper immediately to repair to the Northern 
Department to relieve Schuyler in his Command there. 3 A Comt. 
is appointed to digest and report the Mode of conducting the 
Enquiry. 

It appears to me difficult to account for the Evacuation of those 
Posts even upon the Principle of Cowardice. The whole Con 
duct seems to carry the evident Marks of Deliberation and Design. 
My utmost Endeavors shall not be wanting to have the Matter 
searched to the Bottom. 

If we are vigilant active spirited and decisive, I yet flatter 
my self, notwithstanding the present vexatious Situation of our 
Affairs at the Northwd., we shall humble our Enemies this Cam 
paign. I am truly mortified at their leaving this place, because I 
think we were fully prepared for them, and I believe the cow 
ardly rascals knew it. May Heaven prosper our righteous Cause.

MY DEAR SIR, I received your favours by Mr. Hewes and by 
the post since writeing which you must have heard of the impor 
tant event of the Evacuation of Ti. What will be the consequences 
of it time will discover. What will be the reflections upon it in the 
South you are able before now to say. I suppose many aspertions 
on these States. That languor, supineness, and want of public 
virtue, and spirit prevail here is too true, but do they not prevail 
in the Southern States ? It is true we have not furnished our quota 
of the Army, have they furnished theirs? If they have where are

they? The General Court here have done all in their power, and 
more than the Southern States approved of. It is rather their mis 
fortune than fault that our men are not all in the field; but will 
Congress impute the loss of Ti. to the negligence of these States? 
I see St. Clair s letter published by their order. You will hear 
that the General Court are now met on a special call of the Coun 
cil. I presume we are able, and I hope before we rise we shall de 
monstrate that near 3 500 of our Continental Troops must at that 
time have been at the places of their destination in that depart 
ment : and N : Hampshire say more than 2000 of theirs, and at least 
4000 of them perhaps more, equipt with the New Arms out of the 
French Ship at Portsmouth, as good as any on the Continent, and 
more Militia than they had would have been furnished if requested. 
If you ask how this is to be reconciled to St. Clair s letter, I answer 
that is for him and the other officers to do, upon a severe scrutiny 
which I hope will be made into this matter. The indignation and 
distrust that prevails here are extreem, and the want of confidence 
in your Commanders that way such that if it be not removed by 
Lincoln s 1 being sent there to command the Militia will very much 
impede our Reinforcements. We have ordered a sixth part of the 
Militia of Suffolk, Essex, Middlesex, Worcester, York, Hampshire 
and Berkshire, a small part of two of them excepted to be 
drafted, and marched directly, 2 these I think must make at least 
4000 men. What Connecticut, or Hampshire have done I know 
not. We have also come to some severe resolutions for compleat- 
ing our quota of the Army. We have just received an account that 
our Army have retreated from Saratoga to Stillwater, and that the 
British Fleet and Army had returned to the Hook, and General 
Washington to Morris Town. We have expected them here, which 
occasioned some confusion in this Town for a day or two. We now 
generally suppose they are going up the North River. Had they 
come I believe our Militia would have turned out with a spirit

equal to any of their Neighbours. Upon the alarm from Rhode 
Island, they marched from the Regiments that had orders with 
uncommon readiness and alacrity considering the business of the 
Season. Three or four days would have carried 10,000 of them 
there. No body on that occasion was more embarrassed than I 
was. I don t feel afraid to fight, and I believe you are sensible 
nobody has more zeal for the Cause than I have; but I have too 
much pride to submit to circumstances humiliateing and degrade- 
ing. Our Council ordered me to repair there, and take the com 
mand of them, and receive from General Spencer, or such other 
officer as should be appointed to command there from time to time, 
such directions as they should give me. The last part of the order 
was very extraordinary, and tho the first may be conformable to a 
resolve of Congress you will suffer me to tell you I think that so. 
I know of nothing to determine an officer s rank but his Commis 
sion and the date of it. If we have no right to appoint Major 
Generals we should not have done it. If we have they ought to 
have their rank, with whatever troops they are called to serve, or at 
least the depreciation should have been settled prior to their ap 
pointment, and they should have known what proportion of one 
they were to be, when they came within the splendid orb of a 
Continental Officer. As you have Generals in every State some 
times without a man, even an Orderly Sargeant, to attend them, I 
suppose to command the Militia, I foresee the Militia are to be 
considered in the same light of inferiority with regard to the Con 
tinental Troops that I have been used with indignation to see 
them with regard to the British. This by depressing that spirit of 
military pride which alone can make them important to them 
selves and others, will soon render them of little consequence and 
make a standing Army necessary. As I am somewhat advanced in 
life, and have by the partiality of my countrymen been honoured 
with many civil and military distinctions, and acted a considerable 
part in the present great controversy, I have determined no longer 
to submit to such circumstances, and have therefore embraced this 
interval of security to resign my Commission. You are now to 
excuse being detained so long with a matter of so little conse 
quence, I mean so far as relates to me.

Mr. Gushing and Mr. Paine have been to Springfield to meet 
the Committees from the other N. England States, and New York, 
they returned last evening. 1 Coll. Orne in his humorous way says 
he could not go without Paine and therefore did not go. I am told 
they have unanimously agreed to report a repeal of all regulateing 
Acts, and Land Embargos, and to call in all the money of those 
States by the first of December next, and to have no currency but 
Continental. How long we shall set I cant say. 2 Nothing will de

Mr. Deshon (tho we have expected him ten days) is not yet 
arrived. I see the business is very large and extensive, must en 
gross our whole time, and we are allowed but one clerk, which I 
think quite insufficient. 3 While I remain at this Board I shall do 
every thing I can to answer the design of our appointment, and 
the expectation of my friends; but with you I sigh for private life 
and domestic felicity, and incline to resign. I only delay it from

the ships now shut up in Providence, with those mentioned above, 
I think we should soon have a clear coast. 

The Committee on a Constitution have done nothing lately. 
I hope when we meet again, we shall get along with it, and form 
a tolerable one, but I tremble with diffidence every step I take.

MY DEAR SIR, The inclosed is an attested Copy of General 
Schuyler s Letter to the President of the Congress. It needs no 
Comment. How far the Massachusetts State deserves the stric 
tures therein made, you can tell. I send it to you for the Perusal 
of the Members of your Honbl. House. If they have sent into the 
Army, Boys, Negroes and Men too aged to be fit for any Service, 
they will lay their Hands on their Mouths. If not, I hope some 
decent but keen Pen will vindicate them from that and other 
Aspersions. This, like all his other Letters, is written in such a 
despondent Stile, that it is no wonder that Soldiers decline fight 
ing under him, though they may be under no Apprehension of 
Treachery. But he has by this time receivd his Quietus, at least 
till he can give a good Account of his Conduct. Gates is gone to 
take the Command, and Our Affairs in that Quarter, I dare say, 
will soon wear another Face.

now a just Demand upon you for a Letter. I shall be disappointed 
if I do not receive one by the next Post. Adieu my Friend. 

S. A 

[Enclosure.] 

STILWATER, August 4th, 1777 

SIR, By the unanimous advice of all the general officers, I have moved the 
army to this place; here we propose to fortify a camp in expectation that rein 
forcements will enable us to keep the ground, and prevent the enemy penetrating 
further. I wish I could say that we had any prospect of such reinforcements. 
None of the Militia from the State of Massachusetts or this, will remain with me 
above five or six days longer. The time of service for which colonel Long s regi 
ment is engaged, expires on the 7th inst. This diminution with what we sustain 
by desertion, sickness, and in skirmishes with the enemy will reduce us to an 
alarming weakness. 

What effect my repeated application to the State of Massachusetts will have, I 
cannot determine, as I have not yet been honor d with an answer. Governor 
Trumbull informs me that he has requested General Washington to send troops, 
which he would replace; that he waits his excellency s answer, and in the mean 
time has ordered the militia brigadiers to draft and equip the men; but in what 
numbers, or when I may expect them he does not advise me of. I am equally un 
certain whether I may expect any from this State. 

It is a melancholly consideration that whilst our force is daily diminishing the 
enemy increase theirs, by a continued acquisition of tories in very considerable 
numbers. 

It is impossible at present to procure a return, but I am very certain that we 
have not above four thousand continental troops; if men, one third of which are 
negroes, boys, and men too aged for field, or indeed any other service, can, with 
propriety be called troops. If it should be asked how boys, negroes, and such 
aged men come to be sent; I can only answer that the States from whence these 
troops are come, may possibly determine it. The fact is as I have stated it, liter 
ally so, and I may add, that a very great part of the army took the field, in a 
manner, naked; without blankets, ill armed, and very deficient in accoutrements, 
and still continue so to be, without a prospect of relief, and to add to our misfor 
tunes, many, too many of our officers would be a disgrace to the most contempti 
ble troops that were ever collected, and have so little sense of honor, that cashier 
ing seems no punishment. They have stood by, and suffered the most scandalous 
depredations to be committed on the poor distressed, ruined, and flying inhabit 
ants. I must not however, omit saying that we have many officers that would 
do honor to the best army that ever took the field; but their exertions being 
counteracted by the worthless; it is impossible for them to do what they wish. 
Perhaps Congress may think it necessary to invest me with a power in council of 
general officers to suspend officers for mal-conduct, until the pleasure of Congress 
is known. Should that power be conferred, and I receive it whilst we are still an 
army, it is possible that we may continue so, and get into some order.

STILLWATER, 6th Augt., 1777 (24 Miles above Albany) 

DEAR SIR, This will inform you we left Saratoga the 3rd, 
bringing off all our stores of every kind, with large Droves of 
Cattle, Sheep and Hoggs. 

We arriv d here 3 OClock in the morning of the 4th. During the 
three days at Saratoga, we were Constantly (Night and day) in an 
Alarm, Our scouting parties, a great part of them frequently cut 
off, killd, Scalp d and taken Prisoners. The day we left it our 
Scouts were all drove in by the Indians two Men brot. to my 
Quarters, one of them Scalp d. It appeard they had not been 
dead more than half an hour. 

I immediately detach d 400 Men from my Brigade, to scour the 
Woods, where they remaind till 4 OClock. Saw nothing of the 
Enemy, save three Blanketts, suppos d to be left by them. We 
have had 25 or 30 Men kill d and scalp d, and as many more taken 

I "Schuyler has written a series of weak and contemptible things in a stile of Despond 
ency which alone, I think, is sufficient for the Removal of him from that Command; for if 
his Pen expresses the true Feelings of his Heart, it cannot be expected that the bravest 
Veterans would fight under such a General, admitting they had no Suspicion of Treachery. 
In a letter dated the 4th Instant at Still Water, he writes in a Tone of perfect Despair. He 
seems to have no Confidence in his Troops, nor the States from whence Reinforcements are 
to be drawn. A third Part of his Continental Troops, he tells us, consists of Boys, Negroes 
and aged men not fit for the Field or any other Service. A very great Part of the Army 
naked, without Blanketts, ill armed and very deficient in Accoutrements, without a Pros 
pect of Relief. Many, too many of the Officers would be a Disgrace to the most con 
temptible Troops that ever was collected. The Exertions of others of them of a different char 
acter counteracted by the worthless. Gen l Burgoyne is bending his Course this Way. He 
will probably be here in eight Days, and unless we are well reinforced (which he does not 
expect,) as much farther as he pleases to go. Was ever any poor General more morti

prisoners, within four Days. This strikes a Panic on our Men, 
which is not to be wonderd at, when we Consider the Hazard 
they Run, when out on Scouts, by being fired on, from all Quar 
ters (and the woods so thick, they can t see three yards before 
them), and then to hear the .Cursed War hoop, which makes the 
Woods ring for Miles. 

Our Army at this Post, is weak and shatter d, much Confus d, 
and the Number by no means equal to the Enemy; nor is there the 
Least probability of a Reinforcement. 

Our Artillery, 4 pounders. The Enemys 6, 12, 18 and 24 
pounders. Their flying Camp (as they call it) is now at Fort 
Edward, 24 Miles from this, which Consists of 3000 British 
Troops, 600 Indians, 1000 Tories and 200 Canadians, with 8 Field 
pieces, and 4 Howitzers, 200 Waggons for their Baggage. Their 
main body 5000 Men are at Fort Ann, 14 miles from Fort Edward, 
with their heavy Artillery. This moment brought in by our 
Scouts, two Tories in the Enemy s service. They left Fort 
Edward, Sunday Last, who say s .ome Hessians, with some heavy 
Artillery, from Fort Ann, got in that Day, and that the flying 
Camp were to begin their march for Saratoga in three Days. 

This day Colo. Long from N. Hampshire, leaves us with his 
Regt. which Consist of 200 Men, their time being out; nothing 
will induce them to stay one day Longer. 

The loth goes off 500 Men from Genl. Poor s Brigade, (Militia,) 
from the County of Hampshire. The I2th goes off from Genl. 
Nixon s Brigade, 600 Men, (Militia) from the County of Berkshire. 
We then shall have left 14 Regts. from the State of Massts. Bay - 
(Bigelow s is not yet got in) which Consist of about 150 Rank and 
File, fit for duty, Each ; three Regts. from New Hampshr. 560 Men ; 
One from New York 150 Ditto. Thus you see the whole strength 
of the Army at this Post will be but about 3000 Men (that will be 
on the Ground the I2th inst. unless some Reinforcemt. comes in) 
to Oppose the Enemy, who, from the best Accounts we can Col 
lect, are at least 8000. and every day growing Stronger by the dis 
affected Inhabitants joining them, and ours growing Weaker. 

If we are not Reinforc d speedily, we may as well give up the 
Matter and come home. We pannot make a stand at this place 



Warren- Adams Letters 355 

with that handfull of Men we have, Compared with the Enemy. 
We must retire to Albany immediately, on the Enemy s Advancing 
from Fort Edward, which we expect will be tomorrow. 

I m extremely unhappy in this Departmt. as I know the Popu 
lar Clamour runs high, and the People at Large charge every Mis 
fortune or Accident that happens, to either the Cowardice, Negli 
gence or Treachery of the Officers. The Clamour of the People 
[torn] Schuyler and St. Clair [torn] HilLto Albany, which [torn] 
n them myself, but when [torn] true state of Facts, I must Confess 
[torn] was so much Alterd, I have not the least [complaint] against 
either of them. On the Contrary must say [I think] them to be ex 
ceeding good Officers, and that they have [don]e every thing in their 
power, or that could be done by any Officer in Like Circumstances. 

I have Endeavourd to give you the true State of our Army at this 
Place. A Reinforcemt. lyes with you, and not with us. If we flee 
before the Enemy, it will be for want of Men. You may rely on it 
we shall not turn our Backs on equal Numbers. 

Genl. Schuyler tells me he has wrote to the Assembly of our 
State repeatedly, but has Reed, no Answer. 

We have an Account of Genl. Howe s 1st Division being Landed 
at New Castle. If this is true, your fear of an Attack in your 
Quarter must subside. That being the Case, I hope you will send 
on a Reinforcemt. immediately. Pray let no time be Lost. A 
Day s delay may be fatal to America. Let the Body be as Large 
as possibly can be Collected, furnish d with Arms and Accou- 
tremts. There is none to be had here. Let some Vigilant persons 
come on before them to provide Provisions, Waggons, etca. The 
marching of the Troops have been much Retarded for want of such 
a Regulation. I am, with Respect, Sir, Yr. most Obedt. hume Sert.

a Body of Militia of 900 Men (from Tryon County) Commanded 
by B Genl. Harkermon, 1 (on their March to Reinforce that Post) 
who met with) and 1000 Indians and Tories, 6 miles this side the 
Fort, Commanded by Sir John Johnson ; when an Obstinate Battle 
ensued, 2 in which were kill d a Capt Watts of New York, and 50 or 
60 Indians, on the side of the Enemy, which were found Dead on 
the ground our People beat them from. It s probable a great 
Number were Wounded, which they carried off. 

Genl. Harkermon was shot thro both his legs, broke the Bone 
of one, and much wounded the other. Notwithstanding this, he 
kept with his Men till he could procure Waggons to carry off his 
Wounded, (which were Considerable,) at 24 Miles Distance from 
the place of Action. The Number of Officers kill d on our side are 
many; a Colo. Knox, 3 majors, and several more Subordinate 
Officers, with 22 Privates. The party that Remain d pushd on to 
Fort Schuyler, which was attack d at the same time, by about 800 
of the Enemy. Colo. Gonsewert 3 who Commanded the Fort, 
sallied out upon them, beat them back, took 6 Field pieces and 
two Roiads. The number kill d not ascertain d. 

Genls. Schuyler and St. Clair is order d down to Hd. Quarters (by 
Congress,) to give an Accot. of the Evacuation of Ticonderoga and

PHILA., Aug. 12, 1777 

DEAR SIR, I see by the Papers, our Assembly is called, and 
conclude it is now sitting. 1 

The Letters we receive from G. Schuyler, are enough to frighten 
any Body who does not know him. G. Washington] says that all 
the Regiments from N. H. and M. B. are at the Northward and 
yet, Schuyler tells us he has not above 5000 Men. I hope this mat 
ter will be investigated. I believe Gates will find greater Num 
bers; if not, I hope they will be sent him. 

Burgoine is treading dangerous Ground, and proper Exertions 
will ruin him. These I hope will not be wanting. 

I rejoice to see such a Spirit arise upon the Loss of Ti. and such 
determined Calls for Inquiry. The Facts must be stated from the 
Returns and other Evidence, and the innocent will be I hope ac 
quitted, the guilty meet their Deserts. I see no Medium, I con 
fess, between an honourable Acquittal and capital Punishment. 

What is become of Howe? The Jersies are very happy, relieved 
from an heavy Burthen. What Fears were propagated in Boston 
last January, that the Jersies were lost. Not a single Village, has 
revolted. We have still Accounts of part of Howe s Fleet, coasting 
between the Capes of Delaware and those of Cheasapeak. What 
this Man s design is can not be conjectured; it is very deep or very 
shallow. 

Washington has been here with a noble Army, very obedient, 
and orderly.

ABIGAIL ADAMS TO MERCY WARREN 

August 14, 1777. BRAINTREE. 

This is the memorable fourteenth of August. This day 12 years 
the stamp office was distroyd. Since that time what have we en 
dured? What have we suffer d? Many very many memorable 
events which ought to be handed down to posterity will be buried 
in oblivion, merely for want of a proper Hand to record them; 
whilst upon the opposite Side many venal pens will be imployd to 
misrepresent facts and render all our actions odious in the eyes of 
future generations. I have always been sorry that a certain person 
who once put their Hand to the pen, should be discouraged, and 
give up so important a service. Many things would have been re 
corded by the penetrating genious of that person which, thro the 
multiplicity of events and the avocations of the times, will wholly 
escape the notice of any future Historian. 

The History and the Events of the present day must fill every 
Human Breast with Horrour. Every week produces some Horrid 
Scene perpetrated by our Barbarous foes. Not content with a uni 
form Series of cruelties practised by their own Hands, but they 
must let loose the infernal savages, those dogs of warr, and cry 
Havock to them. Cruelty, impiety, and an utter oblivion of the 
natural Sentiments of probity and Honour, with the violation of 
all Laws Humane and Divine, rise at one view and characterise a 
George, a How, and a Burgoine. 

my dear Friend, when I bring Home to my own Dwelling these 
tragical Scenes which are every week, presented in the publick 
papers to us, and only in Idea realize them, my whole soul is dis- 
tressd. Were I a man, I must be in the Field. I could not live to 
endure the Thought of my Habitation desolated, my children 
butcherd, and I an inactive Spectator.

could expect; but we have a great many hardships to endure yet 
I fear, ere we shall receive any assistance from others. 

Letters from my Friend to the 20 of July mentions the loss of 
Ticonderoga with much regreat,but says tis an event which he has 
feard would take place for some time; people that way were much 
disposed to censure, but that they had not received any perticular 
accounts by which a true judgment could be formd.

We are bless d my Friend with a fine Season and hope the charm

Thread I am in great want of, do if you should know of any be so

I am really ashamed to tell my Friend that I have not yet been 
able to get Home the cloth. All that was in my power to do to it, 
has been done 3 months ago and I have been sending and going 
almost every week since. I saw the Man yesterday and he has 
promised me that I shall have it next week; but if his word prove 
no better than it has done I can not say you may depend upon it. 
All I can say is that my endeavours have not been wanting. As soon 
as I can get it it shall be forwarded by your affectionate Friend,

It is in vain for me to write any Thing of the Northern Depart

COPIES OF LETTERS OF ARTHUR LEE. 

LONDON, Jan. 31, 1777 

DR. SIR, I flatter myself with the pleasure of hearing from you soon, and in 
the mean Time, I wish to convey to you a Piece of important Secret Intelligence, 
relative to the Situation of this Court with Spain and which I procured in such a 
Way, as I gave my Honour I would not repeat it to any one, on this Side of the 
Water. 1 During the latter part of the Administration of Lord Dartmouth a 
Scheme was formed, for establishing a Colony on the Lands of the Musquito 
Indians, and Seven or Eight of that Tribe came hither, and gave Assurance that 
they would sell a Part of their Territory to the English. Dr. Ervin and Captn. 
Blair, were the Persons, who undertook to carry the Project into Execution, and 
accordingly loaded a Vessell and sailed with a Cargo of Goods, Implements of 
Husbandry, Servants, etc. to the Musquito shore. A legislative Council, and 
Justices of Peace were appointed from hence, for the Government of the Colony. 
The Spaniards were alarmed at the Settlement, and in consequence seized the 
Vessell and Cargo: and about Ten Weeks ago Captn. Blair came home to seek 
Redress. Lord Weymouth, immediately sent orders to the British Ambassadors 
at Madrid to demand the Restoration of the Vessell and Cargo. That Court 
peremptorily refused it, unless it was declared that Captn. Blair did not act by 

I Lee was at this time associated with Franklin and Deane. 



I???] Warren- Adams Letters 361 

Authority of the British Court. Lord Weymouth refused to say so, and has told 
the Cabinet, he dare not do it (which will account for his threatened Resignation, 
as was mentioned in one of my former Letters) altho it was a Plan adopted and 
carried into Execution before he came into office, and therefore he alledges he is 
bound to protect and support the Colony, and more especially as the Mosquito 
Indians disclaim all Subordination to the Court of Spain; and on the contrary 
upon the Arrival of each new Governor at Jamaica their King or Sachem, has for 
many years made it an invariable Custom to go to that Island and pay a Sort of 
Homage to its Governor, as the Representative of the Crown of England. The 
Substance of the last answer from Spain was, that if the British Court made it a 
Serious Matter, the Court of Madrid was determined to do the same. I shall not 
trouble you with any Observations upon this Intelligence. You will make your 
own use of it. Lord Weymouth, I am assured will not flinch from it, as he con 
siders himself in a very delicate Situation. 

The Indians in the above Letter returned in the Ship with Dr. Ervin and Capt. 
Blair to the Musquito shore. One of them was a Prince. 

If I had two or three Aid de Camps and a Secretary, as the great Men 
of the Age have, I would present you with a fairer Copy. But we small 
Folks are obliged to do our own Drudgery, and we have so much of it 
to do, that we must do it in Haste. 1 

Extract 

LONDON, 3 Feb., [1777] 

There is no kind of Relaxation here in warlike Preparations, and yet the Minis 
try have so contrived that few People believe there is any danger of war; this 
indeed is necessary to them for the present and untill the subscription to the 
ensuing Loan of Six Millions be compleated, as the Money would otherwise be 
necessarily borrowed at 10 or 12 greater loss. Transports are getting ready to 
carry out the additional British and German Troops to America and it is intended 
they shall all sail by the Beginning of March. 

Administration intend the Campaign shall be opened unusually early in the 
Spring in America, and the Operations directed wholly and on all sides against 
N. England; and they expect by early and vigorous Exertions, to crush the 
Northern Colonies before they can be assisted from the Southward, and before 
any foreign Relief can be given, and thus end the War. It is of importance that 
this Plan of operations shd be known as early as possible in America that N. Eng 
land may in due Season procure necessary Supplies of Flour, Troops, etc. from 
the other Colonies. 

I am much puzzled about the real Intentions of the present Ministry in Respect 
of their great and hasty Armaments. They certainly are too expensive to be mere 
Scarecrows, and, improbable as it may seem on one Account, there is Reason 
to think they intend, when their present Loan is compleated, either to attack

France, or, at least to hold a very high Language to her. Certain it is, that Lord 
Weymouth has of late seriously and warmly urged an immediate Declaration of 
War against France, and tho such Declaration has not been made, it is perhaps 
only suspended. 

At any Rate France seems to have done enough to incur the utmost Resent 
ment of our K. and Ministry, and if she should do no more, she will have Reason 
to think, she has done too much, as some of the Friends of Administration al 
ready insinuate, that as soon as an Accommodation with America can be affected 
the whole of the British Force now there will be turned against St Domingo, etc. 
It is said that the better to hasten an accommodation, offers of a more specific 
Nature will be sent out to America than former ones, perhaps in the dress of an 
Act of Parliament, as it is supposed that the Sword will soon have produced a 
Disposition in the Colonies to listen to them. Wedderburn I understand has been 
some time pressing something of this Nature. 1 

NANTES, Feb. n, 1777 

By the Information I have from London, which I think may be depended upon, 
the Plan of Operations is, for Howe and his recruited Army, to act against New 
England; while Carlton makes his way upon the Lakes to keep the middle Colo 
nies, in Awe; and Burgoine with an Armament from England, of 10,000, if it can 
be procured, invades the South, probably Virginia, and Maryland. The Intelli 
gence from England is, that 10,000 Germans, are actually engaged, while the 
French Minister, and the Spanish Ambassador both assure us, that it is with very 
great Difficulty, the Enemy can procure the Recruits, necessary to keep up the 
Number formerly stipulated. That the Force of their different Armaments, will 
fall greatly short of what they intend, I believe; but it seems to me almost certain, 
that the three Attacks will be made. That their utmost Efforts will be exerted 
this Campaign is infallible; because nothing is more certain than that the present 
State of Europe forbids every Expectation of their being long unemployed nearer 
home. If, therefore, they do not succeed this Year against us there is an End of 
their Prospects of Ravage and Revenge. Even at this Moment they have put 
every Thing in Hazard. England, Ireland, and Hanover are left almost defence 
less by their Efforts against us. I should submit whether it is not fit, that it should 
be made known to the Army, that the Forces to be sent this year, both from Eng 
land and Germany, are new raised, and therefore totally undisciplin d because 
the attacking such Troops on their first Arrival, would be taking them in their 
weakest State, and they ought not to carry with them the Terror of disciplined 
Troops, which in Fact they are not, and of which it would encourage their op 
ponents to be apprised. The French Minister told me, that the King of Great 
Britain had endeavoured in vain to get Troops in Germany to supply the Place 
in Hanover of those which he sent to garrison Gibralter. All these things concur 
to shew, that they are pressed on every Side to make this last Effort against our 
Liberties, which I trust will be met with Proportionable Exertions on our Part, 

i On February 7 Lee set out for the Spanish court, to see what could be done there in 
favor of the colonies. 



Warren- Adams Letters 363 

and under the Providence of Heaven, defeated. The Losses, which the Enemies 
West India Trade has suffered by Captures the last Year, has determined the 
Government to make Provision against it, in future, by sending a Number of 
armed Cutters, which will take the small Cruisers, that have hitherto been so 
successful against their West Indiamen. These too are to be armed as in Time of 
War. I therefore submit to your Consideration the propriety of marking out an 
other Line of cruising for the small Privateers, and sending such only into the 
Gulph, as are of Force to drive off the Cutters, and make Prize of the armed West 
Indiamen. 1 

Feb. 14. Our latest Intelligence from England informs us, that a Bill is now 
passing for granting Letters of Mark, against you, or rather for repealing so much 
of the former Act, as confined it to the Navy. The Press there still continues very 
violent but not equally productive. That, together with the great Preparations 
of France and Spain, seems to render the Continuance of Peace for many Months 
impossible. From every Thing I can learn, their Armaments against you will be 
very late, if the Situation of Europe will suffer them at all. But it is best to pre 
pare for their Plan, as if it would be executed in its fullest Extent. For it is im 
possible to have such Relyance upon the Politicks of Europe, as would justify the 
hazarding much upon their Issue. 

I believe you have not yet been apprised, of what it may be material for you to 
know, which is, that the British Government offered to deliver the Prisoners 
taken on long Island, to the East India Company, to be sent to their Settlements, 
if the Company would send for them to Gibralter. This Proposition is upon 
Record in the Company s Books, a General Court having been expressly held 
upon it. Compared with other Things, it may possibly shew their good Faith; 
and it is itself a sufficient Evidence of their merciless and tyrannical Disposition 
towards us. 

This Letter is from A. Lee. 



JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
BOSTON, September 4, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, I thank you for yours of the I2th and 1 8th 
August which came safe to hand. I am much gratified by seeing 
some account of your plans, and operations abroad. Your good 
Lady obliged me with a sight of a letter of a similar kind she re 
ceived from you some time since. I think on the whole they are 
as well as we could expect, and perhaps in a better way than our 
enemies ever had an idea of. I shall soon forward the inclosed to 
the Foot of the Hill directed.

Secret Correspondence. Wharton, Diplomatic Correspondence of the Revolution, n. 266.

Schuyler s letters, at the same time they discover marks of 
timidity unworthy a General, exhibit a spirit of rancour, partiality 
and malevolence to this state unworthy a Commissary or quarter 
Master, which station he is said to be qualified for. His representa 
tions are extreemly injurious, and I hope we are not to suffer for 
his negligence, etc. The change in that department has given great 
satisfaction here and, with the enquiry ordered to be made, has 
again engaged the confidence of the people. I hope every one will 
have his deserts. It is at least time to check the insolence of any 
officer that shall dare to make any State the object of his malice and 
indecent reflections. Burgoin is indeed treading dangerous ground. 
I expect to hear of his makeing a sudden retreat to save him and 
his Army. We have exerted ourselves and sent a fine reinforce 
ment who I hope are all up before this time. A very pretty body of 
Militia had as I am informed marched to Connecticut River in 
their way to the Army, and were turned back by some General s 
Aid de Camp, because they would not engage to stay three months. 
These were volunteers and consisted of about 1 200, but I will know 
more of the history of this matter. 

I congratulate you on the success of our Arms at the Northward 
and Westward, very pretty affairs indeed, and to be done by the 
poor despised Militia too will give singular pleasure to some peo 
ple. We have just heard of Sullivan s bringing a number of prisoners 
from Staten Island tho not without some loss. We also hear that 
you have found Howe. I congratulate you also in being freed from 
conjecture on that head. I hope our Army will give a good ac 
count of him. He seems to have a great fancy for a trip to Phila 
delphia. Is it to shew his respects to Congress, or does Administra 
tion suppose that the possession of that City will be the Conquest 
of America? It is certainly a favourite plan. Our Committee sets 
on a Constitution of Goverment this day: the Court meets next 
week, our Navy Board are met. How shall I attend these several 
departments? We have no news. Some valuable prizes have ar 
rived, particularly a ship with 1600 hogheads salt, etc., from 
Liverpool. It appears by all her letters that they expect the British 
Troops were in possession of Philadelphia at that time (June). This 
shews to me Howe s destination if we had no other evidence. I

shall trouble you again soon. In the mean time bid you Adieu and 
am Yours Sincerely,

The state of our Currency is in a wretched situation and requires 
the most capital attention. Taxation grows more popular here, and 
I believe the Assembly will risque a Tax of three, if not 4OO,ooo. 
I shall write you hereafter on the subject of oeconomy, and how 
difficult it is to practice it. 

The disposition of the vacant lands, I have no doubt may be 
made to furnish ample resources; but I have some apprehensions 
of the distant consequences if foreigners gain large and extensive 
grants and make settlements. However I dare say you will con 
sider this matter and its consequences. 

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
BOSTON, September 7th, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, I wrote you by the last post. I wonder 
whether all the letters I write you get to hand, and if they do 
whether you are not tired with the number and length of them, to 
say nothing of the composition, etc., which from the confidence 
I have in your candour I pay no regard to. I am now applying 
myself with all diligence to the business of the Navy Board in 
order to answer as far as I am able your expectations and those of 
the publick. I am greatly embarrassed with the forming a Consti 
tution, the General Court setting this week, and the Naval Affairs, 
even if every thing in the last was as I could wish; but I think it 
peculiarly unhappy that we enter on this business when the cir 
cumstances of the Fleet are far from being such as promises any 
hopes that we can gratify the expectations of the people by our 
utmost exertions, especially as they are well pleased with the Ap 
pointment of such a Board, and consequently their expectations 
run high. The Raleigh and Alfred are gone to sea from Portsmouth; 
the Ranger, just ready to sail, will go in a few days under the im 
mediate orders of the Marine Committee. Three Ships shut up in

never to be got out without the greatest difficulty and risque, even 
if there was no enemy to prevent it, and a ship constantly watching 
her. The Boston in this Harbour, the only remaining Ship in our 
department, and she in a condition far from being agreable. And 
great misunderstanding between the Captain and his officers, who 
it is said will not again go to sea with him, and who say he never 
will again man his ship. Capt. McNeil s reputation on his first 
appointment was extreemly good; it seems to be now reversed. 
The last cruise was at first very successful, but did not end so. 
There was certainly great blame somewhere. I won t pretend to 
say where. He lays it on Manley, as you may see by his letters to 
the Marine Committee; while his officers dont scruple to say that 
if he had followed Manley s orders we might have had not only the 
Fox, but the Flora, and Rainbow. 1 We are not invested with powers 
to appoint or even suspend officers but this matter should be en 
quired into. We have ordered him to equip his ship for the sea, 
and man her immediately, and if it can be done shall send her to 
sea. We shall next enquire into the state of the Providence ships 
and the practicability of getting them out. We have wrote to the 
Marine Committee for money and the resolves and regulations of 
Congress relative to the Navy, both of which we are destitute of, 
and can do very little without. Large sums of money are now 
wanted. Do exert yourself to accelerate their motions in forward 
ing them to us. We have very agreable intelligence from the West 
ward this afternoon, that Arnold had cut of the whole Army on 
their retreat from fort Stanwix. I wish it may be true. I hope you 
will soon give me a pleasing account of the operations in the South. 
Nothing of late from the Northwest. Two valuable prizes lately 
arrived at Newbury port, one of them maned with Frenchmen and 
pretends to be French property, tho the Captors say it is only a 
cover and they can prove the property English. All the papers 
were hove overboard. We have by the other late papers, and a 
passenger in nine weeks from London. I dont hear they are yet 
in Town, but I am told the papers mention that Howe was to go 
up to Maryland and from thence to Philadelphia. This passenger 
was sent for by Hutchinson and very perticularly enquired of about

the depreciation of our paper currency, with a malignity of heart 
that shewed he had great reliance on it. This is perfectly in char 
acter, and very probable. The rest of refugees or rather the most of 
them discovered an inclination to get cash. Do write me a few of 
your sentiments on Government. That is a great object with me. 
I wish you happiness. Adieu.

All ideas of oeconomy seem to be lost, or at least in some meas 
ure rendered impracticable by the extravagance of the times. I 
thought the allowance you made for a clerk was handsome. We 
have tryed more than a week to get one even with the addition of 
50. L. M. more, but can t yet effect it. If we give this additional 
sum, it will be from necessity. We must have a clerk and can t get 
one without. If Congress wont allow it we must pay it ourselves. 
Had you not had ample experience to the Southward I would at 
tempt a description of it. Whoever begun it here at first, the Town 
or Country, is a dispute not settled, but I think the Countryman 
exceeds the merchant now. 37 for butter 1/6 for mutton, etc., 
they have the effrontery to ask at a time when Providence has 
given them the finest season and crops you ever see, fruit in the 
same or still greater excess. 3^. for a single peach. If our Board 
are not to have a power of dismissing, or at least of suspending 
officers, I foresee our authority will be contemptible. I will stand 
in no contemptible station long. The good news from the west 
ward I fear wants confirmation.

BOSTON, September I7th, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, - Yours with the inclosed came safe to hand last 
week, and have given me great pleasure. I wish I could in return 
give you any thing that would equally amuse, entertain, or gratify 
your curiosity, but there is not so much as a single piece of news 
here to hand you. We are all agreed that Burgoine is "treading 
dangerous Ground." You are doubtless better informed of the 
motions and intended movements on both sides than I am. Gates 



368 Warren- Adams Letters [1777 

with our Main Army advancing in front, and Lincoln and Arnold 
in the rear of his Army, seems to me a situation not very eligible 
for a fine gentleman or a soldier. We expected to have heard of a 
general action in that quarter before this, as we were informed that 
the two Armys were advancing to each other; but we last evening 
heard that Burgoin had retreated to Fort Edward, and Gates ad 
vanced to Stillwater. I hope they will fight before they part. We 
have various rumours about skirmishes between the Southern 
Armies, which prevail, and as they are generally favourable to us, 
please for a while and then dye. I hope to have this evening from 
you the true situation of them. If you ask what we are about at 
Court, I answer we are provideing for our Soldiers, calling in our 
money, laying taxes, forming a Constitution, neither of which is 
yet done. We have been provideing for the defence of Machias 
and those parts. They are gallant fellows, a late instance of which 
you will see in our papers. They form a frontier, are connected 
with the Indians, and the Enemy have marked them for vengeance. 
We have also been forming an expedition which I can only say will 
be agreable to you. Are you tired of hearing of the forming a Con 
stitution, so am I. It is a long time in hand, and I fear will not be 
marked with the wisdom of Ages. I hope you will see it before this 
Session ends. The spirit of enterprize in manufactures flourishes 
here. Great quantitys of salt are made here; in and about Sand 
wich there is or will very soon be made 200 bushels a day. The 
whole coast is lined with saltworks, but it is altogether performed 
by boiling, a few small works excepted. Molasses from corn stalks 
is also made in large quantities and is very good. It was begun too 
late or would have furnished a full supply and some for distillation. 
I h[e]ard of one little town, the Town of Manchester, that had made 
90 barrels. An acre of tops but at the common season will make 
from thirty to forty gallons, and perhaps planted or sowed on 
purpose, and cut earlier might afford much larger quantities. The 
process is simple three cilinders turned as cider cogs, at once 
grind and express the juice. 

Extravagance, oppression, avarice, etc., are in their zenith I 
hope, and will never rise higher. What will be the consequence of 
them, or what will stop their progress I am unable to say. This

Town was in a tumult all day yesterday carting out Rascals and 
Villains small ones. This seems to be irregular and affords a 
subject for Moderate Folks and Tories to descant largely and wisely 
against mobs, but the patience of the people has beeri wonderful, and 
if they had taken more of them, and some of more importance their 
vengeance, or rather resentment, would have been well directed. 
It therefore seemed wrong to wish to stop them. My regards to all

I am informed by the Clothier General he shall next appoint 
such an Agent here as the delegates of this State shall recommend. 
If you will think proper to recommend Mr. Samuel Allyne Otis you 
will oblige me, and I believe he" will execute the business extreemly 
well. Please to mention this to Mr. Gerry. 



SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

PHILADA., Sept. 17, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, I receivd your favor of the 1st Instant. I have 
not Time at present to give you a particular Account of our Mili 
tary Movementsin this Quarter. I suppose you will have it from our 
Friend Mr. J. A. There was an obstinate Engagement last Thurs 
day. 1 The Enemy were left Masters of the Field, but by all Ac 
counts the Advantage was on our side. Howe and his Army remain 
near the Field of Battle. They have had much to do in dress 
ing their wounded and burying their dead. General Washington 
retreated over the Schuilkil to Germantown a few Miles above this 
City, where he recruited his Soldiers. He has since recrossed the 
River and is posted on the Lancaster Road about 12 Miles distant 
from the Enemy. His Troops are in high Spirits and eager for 
Action. We soon expect another Battle. May Heaven favor our 
righteous Cause and grant us compleat Victory! Both the Armies 
are about 26 Miles from this Place. A Wish for the New England 
Militia would be fruitless. I hope we shall do the Business without 
them. 

I At Brandywine. 



370 Warren- Adams Letters [1777 

I have a favor to ask of you in behalf of my very worthy Friend 
R. H. Lee. He supposes that Mr. Gardoque l of Bilboa has sent 
him some Jesuits Bark. I wish you would inquire of the Captains 
from Bilboa and forward it to him, if any is arrived, by the first 
safe opportunity. I have requested the same thing of Capt. John 
Bradford, not knowing but the Multiplicity of publick Affairs 
might render it impossible for you to attend to it, although I am 
sure you will oblige so good a Patriot as Mr. Lee if it may be in 
your Power. 

We are told that the Enemy have landed in the Jerseys, 4000 
strong. You can tell whether they have left Rhode Island. I have 
Reason to hope that an equal Number of spirited Jersey Militia 
are musterd under the Command of General Dickinson, 2 Brother 
of the late Patriot. These were designd for a Reinforcement to 
the Army here. If the Report be true, these Militia joynd with 
1500 Troops from Peeks Kill (undoubtedly now in Jersey) under 
the Command of Brigr. General McDougal, 3 will be sufficient to 
give a good Account of them. 

I think our Affairs were never in a better Scituation. Our troops 
are victorious in the North. The Enemies Troops are divided and 
scattered over a Country several Hundred Miles. Our Country is 
populous and fertile. If we do not beat them this Fall will not the 
faithful Historian record it as our own Fault? But let us depend, 
not upon the Arm of Flesh, but on the God of Armies. We shall be 
free if we deserve it. We must succeed in a Cause so manifestly 
just, if we are virtuous. Adieu my Friend.

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 

BOSTON, October loth, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, You will recollect that a long time has elapsed 
since I had a line from you. Our hopes and fears with regard to the 
operations of war in your quarter have alternately risen and fallen 
perticularly with regard to the fate of Philadelphia, till yesterday

Warren- Adams Letters 371 

the post informs us that Howe is in peaceable and quiet possession 
of it, without a battle. Has General Washington after all not men 
enough to meet him, or does the high opinion of regulars yet re 
main among his troops so that he dare not oppose them to him? 
This acquisition will have no effect that I know of here, but it will 
be improved, and operate much against our interest in Europe. I 
hope it will not affect your new Funds. 

Nothing decisive has yet taken place in the North. They all 
seem to agree that Burgoyne must retire, fight or starve. I should 
be content with either of the two last, but shall be mortified if the 
first takes place, and he gets off with his Army. No want of men 
in fine spirits, or of arms, provisions, or any thing else. I suppose 
you know as much about them as I can tell you. No descent is yet 
made on Rhode Island. The plan was to have gone on as soon as 
the men got together. They have all but the Connecticut troops, 
who were to have been there as soon as the rest, been on the spot 
ten days, in which time the Enemy have been fortifying. I hope 
however this want of vigour will be supplied by sound judgment in 
the execution, and that I shall be able to give you some agreable 
account from that quarter. We shall have near 10,000 men there. 
We have no other intelligence but the success of the Randolph of 
which I have wrote the Marine Board. Many prizes and valuable 
ones are frequently arriveing. If Howe is in Philadelphia I presume 
you are not. Where is your place of refuge ? x I bid you Adieu and 
am sincerely yours, etc.

JAMES WARREN TO JOHN ADAMS. ADAMS MSS. 
BOSTON, October 12, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, I want extreamly to hear from you to know 
what situation you are in, and what is the true situation of our 
public affairs. It is impossible to describe the confused, uncertain 
accounts we have here of the military operations to the south 
ward. We are at a loss who possesses Philadelphia. We hear that 

I On September 27 Congress adjourned, to meet at Yorktown, Pennsylvania, on the 
30th. 



372 Warren- Adams Letters [1777 

Congress have left it, but we know not what place they have re 
tired to, and consequently I can t tell how to direct this but to the 
old place. We have a fine Army in high spirits and well supplyed 
in the Northern department, but no decisive action has yet taken 
place there. I believe they will prevent Burgoyne advanceing, but 
I think that will be the ultimatum. He will for any thing I can see 
retire when he pleases. Our Troops have not yet landed on Rhode 
Island. There appears in that quarter a want of vigour, and I 
think of judgment. Things were not provided for the descent as 
soon as the Militia arrived and their spirit and genius you know 
does not admit of delays. When the expedition was formed Gen 
eral Spencer informed us every thing was prepared; he had occa 
sion for nothing but tw r o Howitzers which he desired us to supply 
- a very moderate demand. You can t suppose we did not com 
ply. From the very circumstance of this delay my sanguine expec 
tations are much abated. My next will tell you more of this matter 
which is important to us, and I dare say occasions anxiety to you. 
We have men enough there, I believe not less than 10,000. 

We have no news. This will be handed you by Capt. Palmes, 1 
who was Captain of Marines on board the Boston. I am not ac 
quainted with his perticular business. I suppose he intends some 
application to Congress relative to that Ship. Her affairs are in 
deed in a curious situation. The quarrels between the Captain and 
his officers have already occasioned great delays, and when we 
shall be able to get her to sea or if ever under her present circum 
stances I am unable to say. You will be able to learn something 
of the matter from him. I dont wish to be vested with more pow 
ers, if the good of the service dont require it, but I plainly foresee 
that we never can answer your expectations unless we have at 
least a power of suspending, if we are not to be intrusted with a 
power of appointing. 2 As the matter now stands we are little bet 
ter than a Board of Agency or factorage and tho we are ordered 
to do many expensive things are not supplyed with a shilling to do 
it with. This is as bad as makeing bricks without straw. We have

wrote repeatedly to the Marine Committee and have tryed to bor 
row of the Loan Office. He dont like to supply without orders. 
We lost many advantages, and indeed the business in all its parts 
laggs in such a manner as mortifies me, and will affect our reputa 
tion. The Marine Committee have given Capt. McNeil their own 
orders for his next cruise. 1 Dont you intend there shall be an en 
quiry into the conduct of the last? There is indeed a contrast 
between bringing in the Fox and Flora if not the Rainbow, and the 
looseing the Hancock and the Fox. I don t pretend to say who was 
to blame, but I think Congress should know, if they intend officers 
should do their duty in future. I love to see officers regard dis 
cipline and keep a proper command; but overbearing haughtiness 
and unlimited conceit, especially if joined with unbounded ex- 
pence, will never promote the good of your service at sea or ashore. 
It is our business to correct the last in the Navy of this department 
as much as possible, and I think we should be impowered to con- 
troul the first. I wish you every happiness and am Yours, etc.

Monday the I3th. We have just received the agreable news of 
a victory in the Northern department. I am not able to give you 
the perticulars but the action was general, and the defeat com- 
pleat. Our Army was still in the pursuit when the account came 
away. Arnold and Lincoln are wounded, on our side, and Frazier 2 
killed on theirs. Our day however is a little damaged by hearing 
that fort Montgomery 3 is taken.

General Gates. The Express is expected every Hour. I have 
Time only to congratulate you on this and also on a successful 
Engagment on the Delaware, an account of which is containd in

I hope our Countrymen will render the just Tribute of Praise 
to the Supreme Ruler for these signal Instances of his Interposi 
tion in favor of a People struggling for their Liberties. Congress 
will, I suppose recommend the setting apart one Day of publick 
Thanksgiving to be observd throughout the united States. If

found if not seduce the Minds of inconsiderate Persons?

tion, leaving the Count and his Brigade Major, who are wounded and in the Fort. 
The killed and wounded, agreeable to the Letter are five hundred. Lt. Colo. 
Green, who commanded, played upon them a very good Deception. When the 
Flag came in, he concealed all his Men but 50, saying " With these brave Fellows 
this Fort shall be my Tomb." He had five killed and fifteen wounded. 

Yesterday an Attack was made upon Fort Mifflin by Six Ships which were 
warpd thro the Chevaux de Frize at Billingsport in the Night. They began the 
Cannonade at Daybreak, which continued very hot till 10 o Clock, when the Gal- 
lies forced them to give way. In retiring a 64 Gun Ship (said to be the Augusta) 
and a Frigate, the Liverpool, ran aground, and were set on Fire by their own 
People. Two Men were wounded in the Fort.

Fort at Red Bank. 

Howe it is said has publishd a Hand bill in Philadelphia setting forth 
that Burgoyne has gaind a complete Victory having taken Gates and all 
his Army Prisoners, and that he is in full March with a victorious Army 
for Albany and New York. 2 

It needs no comment. 



SAMUEL ADAMS TO JAMES WARREN 

YORK TOWN, PENNSYLVA., Oct. 29, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, I sent you a few days ago an Account of the 
Success we have had on the Delaware. The Honor of recovering 
Philadelphia seems to be intended for the brave Men who com 
mand there; for if the Enemy cannot get up with their Ships of 
War, Howe cannot long remain in the City. May Honor be given 
to whom Honor may be due. -7 

Congress have applyd with Diligence to Confederation. Most 
of the important Articles are agreed to. Each State retains its 
Sovereignty and Independence with every Power, Jurisdiction, 
and Right, which is not by the Confederation expressly delegated 
to the United States in Congress assembled. 

Each State is to have one Vote in Congress; but there must be 
a Concurrence of Nine States in all Matters of Importance. 

1 John Green. 

2 Evans (No. 15313) gives a folio of two pages, " Glorious authentic Intelligence," issued 
October 21, 1777, at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, by Francis Bailey, on the surrender of Bur 
goyne; but no issue such as is described in the text is known.

The Proportion of the publick Expence to be paid by Each 
State to be ascertaind by the Value of all the Lands granted to or 
surveyd for any Person, to be estimated according to such Mode 
as Congress shall from time to time direct. 

All Disputes about Boundaries are to be decided by Judges 
appointed in the following Mode: The Representatives of Each 
State in Congress to be nominated, the contending States to strike 
off 13 each, and out of the remaining 13 not more than 9 nor less 
than 7 shall be drawn out by Lot, any five of them to hear and 
determine the Matter. 

I hope we shall finish the Confederation in a few days when I 
intend to renew my Request for the Leave of Absence, and return 
home. I am determined by God s Assistance never to forsake the 
great Cause in which my Country is virtuously struggling; but 
there are others who have greater abilities and more adequate to 
this important Service, than I have. I hope therefore another will 
be appointed in my Room. It is the greatest Honor of my Life 
to have enjoyd the Confidence of my Country thus long; and I 
have the clear and full Testimony of my own Mind that I have 
at all Times endeavord to fill the Station they have thought fit to 
place me in to their Advantage. 

This will be deliverd to you by Mr. Hancock, who has Leave of 
Absence till the first of January next. 

I hope the Person to be elected in my Room will have under 
standing enough to know when the Arts of Flattery are played 
upon him, and Fortitude of mind sufficient to resist and dispise 
them. This I mention inter Nos nostipsos. In this evil World there 
are oftentimes large Doses prepared for those whose Stomachs will 
bear them. And it would be a Disgrace to human Nature to affirm 
there are some who can take the fullest Cup without nauseating. 

I suppose you have by this time finished a form of Government, -i 
I hope the greatest Care will be taken in the Choice of a Governor. 
He, whether a wise Man or a Fool, will in a great Measure form 
the Morals and Manners of the People. I beg Pardon for hinting 
the Possibility of one of the last Character being chosen: But alas! 
Is there not such a Possibility! But I assure my self of better 
things. I believe my Country will fix their Eyes and their Choice 



I 77i] Warren- Adams Letters 377 

on a Man of Religion and Piety; who will understand human Na 
ture and the Nature and End of political Society; who will not by 
Corruption or Flattery be seducd to the betraying, even without 
being sensible of it himself, the sacred Rights of his Country. 

We are told that the Prisoners taken at the Northward are sent 
into Massachusetts Bay. I hope Burgoyne will not be permitted 
to reside in Boston; for if he is, I fear that inconsiderate Persons 
of Fashion and some significance will be induced, under that Idea of 
Politeness, to form Connexions with him, dangerous to the Publick. 
There are other Reasons which I should think would make his 
or any other officers being fixed in a populous Town uneligible. 
There are Prison Ships, I suppose, provided for the Privates. 

The Success of the present Campaign hitherto has been great 
beyond our most sanguine Expectation. Let us ascribe Glory to 
God who has graciously vouchsafd to favor the Cause of America 
and of Mankind. We are impatiently waiting to hear from Rhode 
Island. Should we succeed in every Quarter, yet we must not slack 
our Hands. Every Nerve must be exerted in preparing for another 
Campaign; for we may be attackd the next Spring with redoubled 
Vigor. 

There is Nothing in my opinion so threatning to us as our de 
preciating Currency. Among the Train of Evils it is likely to bring 
upon us, is the Destruction of Morals; for many will be ready to 
think Extortion and Injustice necessary and justifiable for their 
own Security. I am much pleasd to hear that the People of our 
State are loudly calling for and the Assembly is about to lay on 
a heavy Tax. This, if punctually collected, will be an effectual 
Remedy. I hope the Payment of the Interest on Money borrowd, 
in Bills on France, will bring large Sums into our Loan offices. But 
I am come to a Necessity of concluding. Adieu, my dear Friend.

YORK TOWN, Octob. 30, 1777 

MY DEAR SIR, I have just receivd your agreeable Letter of 
the 8th by the Post, for which please to accept my hearty thanks. 



378 Warren-Adams Letters [1777 

I had written and seald the inclosd Letter, before yours came to 
my Hand. Yesterday Morning Mr. H[ancock], who had several 
times before given Notice to Congress of his Intention to return to 
Boston agreeable to Leave he had obtaind at Philadelphia, made 
a formal Speech to Congress in which he reminded them of his 
having served them as President more than two years; whether 
he had conducted to their Approbation or not, was left to them; 
but he had the Testimony of his own Mind that he had done it to 
the best of his Ability. He thanked them for the Civility they had 
shown him, and if in the Course of Business he had faild in due 
Respect to any Member, as it was not intentional, he hoped it 
would be overlooked. It is likely as I have taken it from Memory 
upon hearing it once read, that I have not done it Justice in point 
of Expression. But it is not improbable that you may have a 
Copy of it; for a Motion was made in the Afternoon by Mr. D 
of N.Y. 1 that a Copy should be requested, and Thanks returnd for 
his great Services, and a Request that he would return and take 
the Chair. This Motion was opposd by several Members, but it 
obtaind so far as to request the Copy, and this Day the latter 
Part of the Motion will be considerd. 2 

I have given you this merely as a Peice of News, leaving you to 
judge of the Tendency and probable Effect of the Speech and 
Motion. We have had two Presidents before, Neither of whom 
made a parting Speech or receivd the Thanks of Congress.

ARTHUR LEE TO 2 

PARIS, Novr. 29, 1777 

DEAR SIR, I wish to represent to you a true State of Man 
agement of your Affairs here, which if not alterd must end in 
total Confusion and Disgrace. You have a Commercial Agent 3 
against whom there are continual Complaints that every hour of his 
Life he is doing every thing to disgrace Congress and disgust others. 
At the same time you have given your Commissioners orders as 
Merchants and Factors. One Commissioner 4 was a Merchant and 
came over here with a View and Stipulation of trading for himself 
as well as for you. Under the Pretence of these orders and that no 
Reliance can be had on the Commercial Agent, the Commission 
ers appoint an Agent 5 and by that Means a mutual Interest is 
formd between two of them to disburse all the Monies receivd for 
the Publick, in merchantile Schemes, through the Hands of that 
Agent and others upon the same jobbing Principles. 

In this Manner three Millions of Livres have been expended and 
near another Million of Debt incurrd, without, I believe, your hav 
ing receivd a Livres worth; and I may venture to say you never 
will receive one half the Value. 

The Time within which these Supplies were expected and ought 
to have been sent, is long ago expired. 

It has not been in the Power of the Third 6 to prevent or correct 
this, from his having been absent a great Part of the Time, from 
the Mercantile Commissioner having assumd the Management to 
himself, and secured the Concurrence of the other thro the Medium 
of Advantages thrown into the Nephew s hands, from their having 
peremptorially told him (the Nephew) that two form the Com 
missioners and acting accordingly. This has put him to the alterna-

tive of approving what has been done without his knowledge, or 
openly quarreling with them, which I conceive would only add to 
the Confusion and Distress of the publick Affairs. He has desired 
from the beginning that regular hours for doing publick Business 
might be settled, and has been constantly refusd. He has repeat 
edly asked for an Account of the Expenditure of the three Millions. 
That too is denied. Whatever is gracious in the Commission, that 
is the Patronage, has been divided amongst the other two, without 
the smallest Participation on his part. 

[Here he proposes a Remedy and then proceeds:] This will re 
move all pretence for their interposing and misapplying the publick 
Money. I say pretence, because they have continued the same 
Conduct since Mr. Alderman Lee s 1 being here, which they pursued 
when Mr. Morris was alone; and Mr. D[eane] has done every 
thing in his Power to render his coming needless. He will continue to 
do so let who will be Agent, unless that Agent submits to his Direc 
tion and acts to his Purposes, or unless you draw a clear Line be 
tween the Commercial and political Characters and forbid any 
Interposition with each other. 

From their first Arrival here Mr. D[eane] seems to have con 
sidered Mr. L[ee] as a dangerous Check upon him; and therefore 
it has been a continued Course of Intrigue by Means of his Agents 
Mr. C. 2 and Dr. B. 3 to traduce Mr. L. and assume to himself all 
the Powers of the Commission, so as even to endeavor to have it 
generally believd that Mr. L. was either not a Commissioner or 
totally insignificant. From this Conduct in private they advancd 
into the publick Papers, until at last they have contrivd to have 
F[ranklin] and D[eane] constantly mentiond both in Print and in 
Conversation as the Commissioners. During Mr. L. s Absence in 
Germany they contrivd to get over Dr. F. by affecting great Par 
tiality for his Nephew, throwing considerable commercial Transac 
tions into his hands and attempting to set him up as commercial 
Agent under the Appointment of the Comrs. to inspect the Arms 
and other things which they were to send out. They at the same 
time circulated a Report both here and in England that a Quarrel 
subsisted between Dr. F. and Dr. Lee, but that the other two

(viz. F. and D.) acted in perfect Harmony. To confirm this in its 
full Extent, as soon as Mr. L. had apprizd the other Commisioners 
of his Intention and Time of returning, Mr. D. gives up a House 
which had been hired and furnishd at publick Expence in Paris, 
and took Possession of the Apartments he had before refusd which 
were fitted up for Mr. L. at Passie, in the same House with Dr. F. 
This Stroke was to hold out at once the Appearance of Union be 
tween them and Difference with Mr. L., and concentrate the 
publick Attention upon them alone. And the better to secure these 
Effects, it was whisperd that this was done by the particular De 
sire of Dr. F. . . . Mr. L. conceives that Nothing can be more det 
rimental to the publick Interest than an open Quarrel, he has de- 
termind to bear every thing rather than commence a Dispute. 
He proposd that one of the Millions they receivd should be funded 
to pay the Interest of your Loans and give Credit to your Paper, 
but every Livre is spent. He has urgd that this may be done with 
what they are to receive. That too is in vain. 

[Mr. Dodd is going; more at another time.] 1 

That too is in vain, for it is resolvd to spend the Money and 
trust to Fortune for the paying your Interest as the Commis 
sioners promise. Yet it is adviseable to draw, because they may 
still be able to answer. But this expending Spirit will continue, 
till the disbursing of Money is taken entirely from them and placd 
where it ought to be. 

Much ill humour is expressed by Mr. D. against the french 
Court, and he has endeavord to make others hold the same Lan 
guage. But his Colleagues think very differently; and are of opin 
ion that this Court has been compelled to every Step of Severity 
by gross Misconduct in others. The principal was Cunningham s 
Business at Dunkirk. 2 With the particulars of this Affair Mr. 
Lee is to this Moment unacquainted. Mr. D. is unwise enough to 
declare that he did it to excite a War. Such an Attempt, without 
the Advice and Concurrence of the others in the Propriety of it

and in the Means, was highly criminal. He is conscious of it and 
therefore seems to be searching for Shelter under a general Discon 
tent and Disagreement, than which, if it operates on our Friends 
here, nothing can be more injurious. For tho they do not all we 
wish, they certainly do more than any others. It would be both 
Ingratitude and Folly to repay it with ill humour and ill Will. 
They told the Commissioners from the Beginning the Line they 
meant to pursue, and repeatedly entreated them not to transgress 
it and involve them. It has been transgressd under this Gentle 
man s Advice and by his Agents, with strong Circumstances of ill 
Faith and with the ridiculous Idea of forcing them into a War. 
The Consequences of this have fallen upon our Heads, and we have 
not the least Pretence for Complaint. 

I am not so little read in Men and Books as not to know that 
such Men and such Actions are found in all political Circles. But 
I lament that they are fallen upon in this important Moment and 
that they have been so detrimental to the publick Service. The 
Fear of increasing that Injury has made Mr. L. concur in Meas 
ures of which he disapprovd, prevented him from resenting most 
atrocious Injuries and determind him to stifle his Complaints to 
any but his confidential Friends. I hope the proposed Plan will 
remedy all. 

[Our Success at the Northward last fall, I am inclind to think 
prevented those Differences and this Misconduct from having the 
most mischievous Effects.] l
