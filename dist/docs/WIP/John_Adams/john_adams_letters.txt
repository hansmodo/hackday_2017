I AM extremely afflicted with the relation your father gave me of the return of your disorder. I fear you 
have taken some cold. We have had a most pernicious air, a great part of this spring. I am sure I 
have reason to remember it. My cold is the most obstinate and threatening one I ever had in my life. 
However I am unwearied in my endeavours to subdue it, and have the pleasure to think I have had some 
success. I rise at five, walk three miles, keep the air all day and walk again in the afternoon. These 
walks have done me more good than anything. My own infirmities, the account of the return of yours, 
and the public news coming altogether have put my utmost philosophy to the trial.

</p><p>
We live, my dear soul, in an age of trial. What will be the consequence, I know not The town of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, for aught I can see, must suffer martyrdom. 
It must expire. And our principal consolation is, that it dies in a noble cause the cause of truth, of virtue, 
of liberty and of humanity, and that it will probably have a glorious resurrection to greater wealth, splendor and power than ever. 
</p><p>
Let me know what is best for us to do. It is expensive keeping a family here, and there is no prospect of any business in my way in this town this 
whole summer. I Don't receive a shilling a week. We must contrive as many ways as we can to save 
expenses ; for we may have calls to contribute very largely, in proportion to our circumstances, to prevent 
other very honest worthy people from suffering for want, besides our own loss in point of business and profit 
</p><p>
Don t imagine from all this that I am in the dumps. Far otherwise. I can truly say, that I have felt more 
spirits and activity since the arrival of this news than I had done before for years. I look upon this as the 
last effort of Lord North's despair, and he will as surely be defeated in it, as he was in the project of the tea. I am, with great anxiety for your health,

York, 29 June, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1774">1774</a>. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
I HAVE a great deal of leisure, which I chiefly employ in scribbling, that my mind may not stand still 
or run back, like my fortune. There is very little business hero, and David Scwall, David Wyer, John Sullivan and James Sullivan and Theophilus Bradbury 
are the lawyers who attend the inferior courts, and consequently, conduct the causes at the superior. 
</p><p>
I find that the country is the situation to make estates by the law. John Sullivan, who is placed at Durham in New Hampshire, is younger both in years and 
practice than I am. He began with nothing, but is now said to be worth ten thousand pounds lawful 
money, his brother James allows five or six or perhaps seven thousand pounds, consisting in houses and 
lands, notes, bonds and mortgages. He has a fine stream of water with an excellent corn mill, saw mill, 
fulling mill, scythe mill and others, in all, six mills, which are both his delight and his profit. As he has 
earned cash in his business at the bar, he has taken opportunities to purchase farms of his neighbours, who 
wanted to sell and move out farther into the woods, at an advantageous rate, and in this way has been growing rich ; under the smiles and auspices of Governor Wentworth, he has been promoted in the civil and military way, so that he is treated with great respect in this neighbourhood. 
</p><p>
James Sullivan, brother of the other, who studied law under him, without any academical education 
(and John was in the same case), is fixed at Saco, alias Biddeford, in our province. He began with neither 
learning, books, estate nor anything but his head and hands, and is now a very popular lawyer and growing 
rich very fast, purchasing great farms, &c., and a justice of the peace and a member of the General Court. 
</p><p>
David Sewall, of this town, never practises out of this county ; has no children ; has no ambition nor 
avarice, they say, (however quaere.) His business in this county maintains him very handsomely, and he gets beforehand. 
</p><p>
Bradbury at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=falmouth" rel="city">Falmouth</a>, they say, grows rich very fast. 
</p><p>
I was first sworn in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>. My life has been a continual scene of fatigue, vexation, labour and anxiety. 
I have four children. I had a pretty estate from my father; I have been assisted by your father; I 
have done the greatest business in the province ; I have had the very richest clients in the province. Yet I am poor, in comparison with others. 
</p><p>
This, I confess, is grievous and discouraging. I ought however to be candid enough to acknowledge 
that I have been imprudent I have spent an estate in books ; I have spent a sum of money indiscreetly 
in a lighter, another in a pew, and a much greater in a house in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. These would have been indiscretions, if the impeachment of the Judges, the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> port bill, &c. &c., had never happened ; but by the unfortunate interruption of my business from 
these causes, those indiscretions became almost fatal to me ; to be sure, much more detrimental. 
</p><p>
John Lowell, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=newburyport" rel="city">Newburyport</a>, has built himself a 
house like the palace of a nobleman, and lives in 
great splendor. His business is very profitable. In 
short, every lawyer who has the least appearance of 
abilities, makes it do in the country. In town, nobody 
does, or ever can, who either is not obstinately determined never to have any connexion with politics, or 
does not engage on the side of the Government, the Administration and the Court. 
</p><p>
Let us, therefore, my dear partner, from that affection which we feel for our lovely babes, apply our selves, by every way we can, to the cultivation of our 
farm. Let frugality and industry be our virtues, if they are not of any others. And above all cares of this life, let our ardent anxiety be, to mould the minds 
and manners of our children. Let us teach them not only to do virtuously, but to excel. To excel, they must be taught to be steady, active and industrious. 
</p><p>
I am, &c. Your

MOBS are the trite topic of declamation and invective among all the ministerial people far and near. 
They are grown universally learned in the nature, 
tendency and consequences of them, and very elegant and pathetic in descanting upon them. They 
are sources of all kinds of evils, vices and crimes, they 
say. They give rise to profaneness, intemperance, 
thefts, robberies, murders, and treason. Cursing, 
swearing, drunkenness, gluttony, lewdness, trespasses, 
maims are necessarily involved in them and occasioned by them. Besides, they render the populace, the 
rabble, the scum of the earth, insolent and disorderly, impudent and abusive. They give rise to lying, 
hypocrisy, chicanery and even perjury among the people, who are driven to such artifices and crimes, 
to conceal themselves and their companions from prosecutions in consequence of them. 
</p><p>
This is the picture drawn by the Tory pencil; and it must be granted to be a likeness. But this is 
declamation. What consequence is to be drawn from this description ? Shall we submit to parliamentary 
taxation, to avoid mobs? Will not parliamentary taxation, if established, occasion vices, crimes and 
follies, infinitely moie numerous, dangerous and fatal to the community? Will not parliamentary 
taxation, if established, raise a revenue unjustly and wrongfully ? If this revenue is scattered by the hand 
of corruption among the public officers and magistrates and rulers in the community, will it not propagate vices more numerous, more malignant and 
pestilential among them ? Will it not render magistrates servile and fawning to their vicious superiors, 
and insolent and tyrannical to their inferiors ? Are insolence, abuse and impudence, more tolerable in a 
magistrate than in a subject ? Are they not more constantly and extensively pernicious ? And does 
not the example of vice and folly in magistrates descend and spread downwards among the people ?
</p><p>
Besides, is not the insolence of officers, and soldiers, and seamen, in the army and navy, as mischievous as that of porters, or of sailors in the merchant service ? Are not riots, raised and made by armed men, as bad, as those by unarmed ? Is not an assault upon a civil officer, and a rescue of a prisoner from lawful authority, made by soldiers with swords 
or bayonets, as bad, as if made by tradesmen with staves ? 
</p><p>
Are not the killing of a child by R,, I and the slaughter of half a dozen citizens by a party of soldiers, as 
bad as pulling down a house or drowning a cargo of tea, even if both should be allowed to be unlawful &gt; 
Parties may go on declaiming, but it is not easy to say, which party has excited most riots, which has 
published most libels, which has propagated most slander, and defamation ? Verbal scandal has been 
propagated in great abundance by both parties ; but there is this difference, that one party have enjoyed 
almost all public offices, and therefore, their defamation has been spread among the people more secretly, 
more maliciously and more effectually. It has gone with greater authority, and been scattered by instruments more industrious. The ministerial newspapers have swarmed with as numerous and as malicious libels as the anti ministerial ones. Fleet's paper, Mein's Chronicle, &c. &c., have been as virulent as 
any that was ever in the province. These bickerings of opposite parties, and their mutual reproaches, their 
declamations, their sing-song, their triumphs and defiances, their dismals and prophecies are all delusion. 
</p><p>
We very seldom hear any solid reasoning. I wish always to discuss the question, without all painting, pathos, rhetoric or flourish of every kind. And 
the question seems to me to be, whether the American colonies are to be considered as a distinct community so far as to have a right to judge for them 
selves, when the fundamentals of their government are destroyed or invaded ? or whether they are to be 
considered as a part of the whole British empire, the whole English nation, so far as to be bound in 
honor, conscience or interest by the general sense of the whole nation ? However, if this was the rule, 
I believe it is very far from the general sense of the whole nation, that America should be taxed by the 
British parliament. If the sense of the whole of the Empire could be fairly and truly collected, it would 
appear, I believe, that a great majority would be against taxing us, against or without our consent. It 
is very certain, that the sense of parliament is not the sense of the empire, nor a sure indication of it. 
But, if all other parts of the empire were agreed unanimously in the propriety and rectitude of taxing 
us, this would not bind us. It is a fundamental, inherent and unalienable right of the people, that they 
have some check, influence or control in their supreme legislature. If the right of taxation is con 
ceded to parliament, the Americans have no check or influence at all left. This reasoning never was nor can be answered.

MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
HAVE you seen a list of the addressers of the late 
Governor ? There is one abroad, with the character, profession or occupation of each person against his 
name. I have never seen it, but Judge Brown saye, against the name of Andrew Faneuil Phillips is 
" Nothing." And that Andrew, when he first heard 
of it, said : " Better be nothing with one side, than 
every thing with the other." This was witty and 
smart, whether Andrew said it, or, what is more likely, 
it was made for him. A notion prevails among all 
parties, that it is politest and genteelest to be on the 
side of Administration; that the better sort, the 
wiser few are on one side ; and that the multitude, 
the vulgar, the herd, the rabble, the mob only are on 
the other. So difficult it is for the frail, feeble mind 
of roan to shake itself loose from all prejudice and 
habits. However Andrew or his prompter is perfectly right in his judgment, and will finally be proved to 
be so, that the lowest on the Tory scale will make it 
more for his interest than the highest on the Whiggish. And as long as a man adheres immovably to 
his own interest, and has understanding or luck enough 
to secure and promote it, he will have the character 
of a man of sense, and will be respected by a selfish 
world. I know of no better reason for it than this, 
that most men are conscious that they aim at their 
own interest only, and that if they fail, it is owing to 
short sight or ill luck, and therefore they can't blame, 
but secretly applaud, admire and sometimes envy those, 
whose capacities have proved greater and fortunes more prosperous. 
</p><p>
I am engaged in a famous cause. The cause of 
King of Scarborough versus a mob that broke into his 
house and rifled his papers and terrified him, his wife, 
children and servants in the night. The terror and distress, the distraction and horror of this family can 
not be described by words, or painted upon canvass. 
It is enough to move a statue, to melt a heart of stone, 
to read the story. A mind susceptible of the feelings 
of humanity, a heart which can be touched with sensibility for human misery and wretchedness mustlreluct, must burn with resentment and indignation at 
such outrageous injuries. These private mobs I do 
and will detest. If popular commotions can be justified in opposition to attacks upon the Constitution, it 
can be only, when fundamentals are invaded, nor then, 
unless for absolute necessity, and with great caution. But these tarrings and featherings, this breaking open 
houses by rude and insolent rabble in resentment for private wrongs, or in pursuance of private prejudices 
and passions, must be discountenanced. It cannot be even excused upon any principle, which can be entertained by a good citizen, a worthy member of society. 
</p><p>
Dined with Mr. Collector Francis Waldo, Esquire, in company with Mr. Winthrop, the two Quincys and 
the two Sullivans, all very social and cheerful full of politics.'s. Quincy's tongue ran as fast as 
any body's. He was clear in it, that the House of Commons had no right to take money out of our 
pockets more than any foreign state ; repeated large paragraphs from a publication of Mr. Burke's 
in 1766, and large paragraphs from Junius Americanus, &c. This is to talk and to shine before persons 
who have no capacity of judging, and who do not know, that he is ignorant of every rope in the ship. 
</p><p>
I shan't be able to get away till next week. I am concerned only in two or three cases, and none of 
them are come on yet Such an Eastern circuit I never made. I shall bring home as much as I brought 
from home, I hope, and not much more, I fear. I go mourning in my heart all the day long, though I say 
nothing. I am melancholy for the public and anxious for my family. As for myself, a frock and trowsers, a hoe and a spade would do for my remaining days. 
</p><p>
For God's sake make your children hardy , active, and industrious; for strength, activity and industry will be their only resource and dependence.

MY DEAR,
</p><p>
I NEVER enjoyed better health in any of my journeys,but this has been the most tedious, the most irk 
some, the most gloomy and melancholy I ever made. I cannot, with all my philosophy and Christian resignation, keep up my spirits. The dismal prospect before 
me, my family, and my country, is too much for my fortitude. 
</p><p>
" Bear me. some God ! Oh quickly bear me hence To wholesome solitude, the nurse of sense ; 
Where contemplation prunes her ruffled wings, And the free soul looks down to pity kings." 
</p><p>
The day before yesterday, a gentleman came and 
spoke to me, asked me to dine with him on Saturday ; 
said he was very sorry I had not better lodgings in 
town ; desired, if I came to town again, I would take 
a bed at his house and make his house my home, I 
should always be very welcome. I told him I had 
not the pleasure of knowing him. He said his name 
was Codman. I said I was very much obliged to him, 
but I was very well accommodated where I lodged. 
I had a clean bed and a very neat house, a chamber to myself, and every thing I wanted. 
</p><p>
Saturday, I dined with him, in company with Brigadier Prcble, Major Freeman and his son, &c., and a 
very genteel dinner we had. Salt fish and all its apparatus, roast chickens, bacon, peas, as fine a salad as 
ever was made, and a rich meat pie. Tarts and custards, &c., good wine and as good punch as ever you 
made. A large, spacious, elegant house, yard and garden ; I thought I had got into the palace of a nobleman. After dinner, when I was obliged to come 
away, he renewed his invitation to me, to make his 
house my home whenever I shall come to town again. Friday,! dined with Colonel, Sheriff, alias Bill Tyng. 
Mrs. Ross and her daughter Mrs. Tyng dined with us, and the Court, and Clerk, and some of the bar. At table, we were speaking about Captain MacCarty, which 
led to the African trade. Judge Trowbridge said, " That was a very humane and Christian trade, to be 
sure, that of making slaves." " Ay," says I, " it makes no great odds ; it is a trade that almost all mankind have 
been concerned in, all over the globe, since Adam, more or leas, in one way and another." This occasioned a laugh. 
</p><p>
At another time, Judge Trowbridge said," It seems, by Colonel Barre's speeches, that Mr. Otis has acquired 
honor by releasing his damages to Robinson." "Yes," says I, " he has acquired honor with all generations. 19 Trowbridge. " He did not make much profit, I think." 
Adams. " True, but the less profit, the more honor. He was a man of honor and generosity, and those who think he was mistaken, will pity him." 
</p><p>
Thus you see how foolish I am. I cannot avoid exposing myself before these high folks ; my feelings will at times overcome my modesty and reserve, 
my prudence, policy and discretion. I have a zeal at my heart for my country and her friends, which I cannot smother or conceal ; it will burn out at times 
and in companies, where it ought to be latent in my breast. This zeal will prove fatal to the fortune and felicity of my family, if it is not regulated by a 
cooler judgment than mine has hitherto been. Colonel Otis's phrase is, " The zeal-pot boils over." 
</p><p>
I am to wait upon brother Bradbury to meeting to day, and to dine with brother Wyer. When I shall 
get home, I know not, but if possible, it shall be be fore next Saturday night I long for that time to 
come, when my dear wife and my charming little prattlers will embrace me.

</p><p>
I RECEIVED your kind letter at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and it is not easy for you to imagine the pleasure it has given 
me. I have not found a single opportunity to write 
since I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, excepting by the post, and I don't choose to write by that conveyance, for fear of foul 
play. But as we are now within forty-two miles of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, I hope there to find some private hand by which I can convey this. 
</p><p>
The particulars of our journey I must reserve, u&gt; be communicated after my return. It would take a 
volume to describe the whole. It has been upon the whole an agreeable jaunt. We have had opportunities to see the world and to form acquaintances with 
the most eminent and famous men, in the several Colonies we have passed through. We have been treated with unbounded civility, complaisance and 
respect. We yesterday visited Nassau Hall College, and were politely treated by the scholars, tutors, pro fessors, and President whom we are this day to hear 
preach. Tomorrow we reach the theatre of action. God Almighty grant us wisdom and virtue sufficient for the high trust that is devolved upon us. The spirit 
of the people, wherever we have been, seems to be very favorable. They universally consider our cause 
as their own, and express the firmest resolution to abide by the determination of the Congress. 
</p><p>
I am anxious for our perplexed, distressed province I hope they will be directed into the right path. Let me entreat you, my dear, to make yourself as easy 
and quiet as possible. Resignation to the will of Heaven is our only resource in such dangerous times. Prudence and caution should be our guides. I have 
the strongest hopes that we shall yet see a clearer sky and better times. 
</p><p>
Remember my tender love to little Abby tell her she must write me a letter and inclose it in the next 
you send. I am charmed with your amusement with our little Johnny. Tell him I am glad to hear he is 
so good a boy as to read to his mamma for her entertainment, and to keep himself out of the company of rude children. Tell him I hope to hear a good account of his accidence and nomenclature when I re turn. Remember me to all inquiring friends, particularly to uncle Quincy, your papa and family, and 
Dr. Tufts and family. Mr. Thaxter, I hope, is a good companion, in your solitude. Tell him, if he 
devotes his soul and body to his books, I hope, notwithstanding the darkness of these days, he will not 
find them unprofitable sacrifices in future. I have received three very obliging letters from Tudor, Trumbull and Hill. They have cheered us in our 
wanderings and done us much service. 
</p><p>
Your account of the rain refreshed me. I hope our husbandry is prudently and industriously man 
aged. Frugality must be our support. Our expenses in this journey will be very great. Our only [recompense will ] be the consolatory reflection that we toil, spend our time and [encounter] dangers for the public good happy indeed if we do any good. 
</p><p>
The education of our children is never out of my mind. Train them to virtue. Habituate them to industry, activity and spirit. Make them consider every 
vice as shameful and unmanly. Fire them with ambition to be useful. Make them disdain to be 
destitute of any useful or ornamental knowledge or accomplishment. Fix their ambition upon great and 
solid objects, and their contempt upon little, frivolous and useless ones. It is time, my dear, for you to be 
gin to teach them French. Every decency, grace and honesty should be inculcated upon them. 
</p><p>
I have kept a few minutes by way of journal, which shall be your entertainment when I come home ; but 
we have had so many persons and so various characters to converse with, and so many objects to view, 
that I have not been able to be so particular as I could wish. I am, with the tenderest affection and concern, Your wandering

MY DEAR,
</p><p>
WHEN or where this letter will find you, I know not 
In what scenes of distress and terror, I cannot foresee. We have received a confused account from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> of a dreadful catastrophe. The particulars 
we have not heard. We are waiting with the utmost 
anxiety and impatience, for further intelligence. 
The effect of the news we have, both upon the Congress and the inhabitants of this city, was very great. 
Great indeed ! Every gentleman seems to consider 
the bombardment I of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> as the bombardment 
of the capital of his own province. Our deliberations are grave and serious indeed. 
</p><p>
It is a great affliction to me that I cannot write to you oftener than I do. But there are so many 
hindrances, that I cannot. It would fill volumes, to give you an idea of the scenes I behold, and the 
characters I converse with. We have so much business, so much ceremony, so much company, so many 
visits to receive and return, that I have not time to write. And the times are such as to make it imprudent to write freely. 
</p><p>
We cannot depart from this place until the business of the Congress is completed, and it i.s the 
general disposition to proceed slowly. When I shall be at home I can't say. If there is distress and danger in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, pray invite our friends, as many as 
possible, to take an asylum with you Mrs. Gushing and Mrs. Adams, if you can. There is in the 
Congress a collection of the greatest men upon this continent in point of abilities, virtues, and fortunes. 
The magnanimity and public spirit which I see here make me blush for the sordid, venal herd which I have seen in my own Province. The Addressers, 
and the new Councillors, I are held in universal contempt and abhorrence from one end of the continent to the other. 
</p><p>
Be not under any concern for me. There is little danger from any thing we shall do at the Congress. 
There is such u spirit through the colonies, and the members of the Congress are such characters, that no 
danger can happen to us, which will not involve the whole continent in universal desolation ; and in that case, who would wish to live ?

Adieu.

MY DEAR,
</p><p>
I RATE written but once to you since I left you. This is to be imputed to a variety of causes, which 
I cannot explain for want of time. It would fill volumes to give you an exact idea of the whole tour. 
My time is totally filled from the moment I get out of bed until I return to it. Visits, ceremonies, company, business, newspapers, pamph ets, &c. &c. &c. 
</p><p>
The Congress will, to all present appearance, be well united, and in such measures as, I hope, will give 
satisfaction to the friends of our country. A Tory here is the most despicable animal in the creation. 
Spiders, toads, snakes are their only proper emblems. The Massachusetts Councillors and Addressers are 
held in curious esteem here, as you will see. The spirit, the firmness, the prudence of our province are 
vastly applauded, and we are universally acknowledged, the saviours and defenders of American liberty. 
The designs and plans of the Congress must not be 
communicated until completed, and we shall move with great deliberation.

When I shall come home I know not, but at present, I do not expect to take my leave of this city

</p><p>
HAVING a leisure moment, while the Congress is assembling, I gladly embrace it to write you a line. 
When the Congress first met, Mr. Gushing made a motion that it should be opened with prayer. It was 
opposed by Mr. Jay of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and Mr. Rutledge of South Carolina, because we were so divided in religious sentiments ; some Episcopalians, some 
Quakers, some Anabaptists, some Presbyterians, and some Congregational ists, that we could not join in the 
same act of worship. Mr. Samuel Adams arose and said, he was no bigot, and could hear a prayer 
from a gentleman of piety and virtue, who was at the same time a friend to his country. He was a 
stranger in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, but had heard that Mr. Duche " (Dushay they pronounce it) " deserved that 
character, and therefore he moved, that Mr. Duche, an episcopal clergyman, might be desired to read prayers to the Congress tomorrow morning." The 
motion was seconded and passed in the affirmative. Mr. Randolph, our President, waited on Mr. Duche and received for answer that, if his health would 
permit, he certainly would. Accordingly, next morning he appeared with his clerk and in his pontificals, 
and read several prayers in the established form, and then read the collect for the seventh day of September, which was the thirty-fifth Psalm. You must remember, this was the next morning after we heard 
the horrible rumor of the cannonade of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. 
I never saw a greater effect upon an audience. It seemed as if Heaven had ordained that Psalm to be read on that morning. 
</p><p>
After this, Mr. Duche, unexpectedly to every body, struck out into an extemporary prayer, which filled the 
bosom of every man present. I must confess, I never heard a better prayer, or one so well pronounced. Episcopalian as he is, Dr. Cooper himself 
never prayed with such fervor, such ardor, such earnestness and pathos, and in language so elegant 
and sublime, for America, for the Congress, for the province of Massachusetts Bay, and especially the 
town of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. It has had an excellent effect upon 
every body here. I must beg you to read that Psalm. If there was any faith in the sortes Yirgilianse, or sortes Homericae, or especially the sortes Biblicse, it would be thought providential. 
</p><p>
It will amuse your friends to read this letter and the 35th Psalm to them. Read it to your father and Mr. Wibird. I wonder what our <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a> church 
men would think of this. Mr. Duche is one of the most ingenious men, and best characters, and greatest orators in the episcopal order upon this continent ; 
yet a zealous friend of liberty and his country. 
</p><p>
I long to see my dear family God bless, preserve, and prosper it.

Adieu.

MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
I RECEIVED your very agreeable letter by Mr. Marston, and have received two others which gave me 
much pleasure. I have written several letters, but whether they have reached you, I know not. There 
is so much rascality in the management of letters now come in fashion, that I am determined to write no 
thing of consequence, not even to the friend of my bosom, but by conveyances which I can be sure of. 
</p><p>
The proceedings of the Congress are all a profound secret as yet, except two votes which were passed 
yesterday, and ordered to be printed. You will. see them from every quarter. These votes I were passed 
in full Congress with perfect unanimity. The esteem, the affection, the admiration for the people of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> 
and the Massachusetts, which were expressed yesterday, and the fixed determination that they should 
be supported, were enough to melt a heart of stone. I saw the tears gush into the eyes of the old, grave, 
pacific Quakers of Pennsylvania. 
</p><p>
You cannot conceive, my dear, the hurry of business, visits, and ceremonies which we are obliged to go through. 
</p><p>
We have a delicate course to steer between too much activity, and too much insensibility in our critical, interested situation. I flatter myself, however, 
that we shall conduct our embassy in such a manner, 
as to merit the approbation of our country. It has 
taken us much time to get acquainted with the tempers, views, characters and designs of persons, and to 
let them into the circumstances of our province. My 
dear, do intreat every friend I have to write me. 
Every line which comes from our friends is greedily 
inquired after, and our letters have done us vast service. Middlesex and Suffolk have acquired unbounded honor here. There is no idea of submission here in anybody's head. 
</p><p>
Thank my dear Abby for her letter ; tell her it has given me great spirits. Kiss all my sweet ones for me.

</p><p>
MY DEAR,
</p><p>
IN your last, I you inquire tenderly after my health, 
and how we found the people upon our journey, and how we were treated. I have enjoyed as good health 
as usual, and much more than I know how to account for, when I consider the extreme heat of the weather, and the incessant feasting I have endured ever since I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. 
</p><p>
The people in Connecticut, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, the Jerseys, and Pennsylvania, we have found extremely well principled, and very well inclined, although some persons 
in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> wanted a little animation. Their zeal, however, has increased wonderfully since we began our journey. When the horrid 
news was brought here of the bombardment of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, which made us completely miserable for two 
days, we saw proofs both of the sympathy and the 
resolution of the continent. War! war! war! was 
the cry, and it was pronounced in a tone which would 
have done honor to the oratory of a Briton or a Roman. If it had proved true, you would have heard the thunder of an American Congress. 
</p><p>
I have not time, nor language to express the hospitality and the studied and expensive respect with 
which we have been treated in every stage of our progress. If Camden, Chatham, Richmond and St. Asaph 
had travelled through the country, they could not have been entertained with greater demonstrations of respect than Cusjiing, Paine, and the brace of Adamses 
have been. The particulars will amuse you when we return. 
</p><p>
I confess, the kindness, the affection, the applause 
which have been given to me, and especially to our 
province, have many n time filled my bosom and 
streamed from my eyes. My best respects to Colonel Warren and his lady 
when you write to them. I wish to write them.

I AM very well yet. Write to me as often as you

The evils will not be found so dreadful as you apprehend them. Frugality, my dear, frugality, economy, parsimony, must be our refuge. I hope the ladies are

I would not lose the opportunity of writing to you, though I must be short.

Tedious indeed is our business slow as snails. I have not been used to such ways. We sit only before dinner. We dine at four o clock. We are crowded with a levee in the evening.

</p><p>
MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
SITTING down to write you is a scene almost too tender for my state of nerves. 
</p><p>
It calls up to my view the anxious, distressed state you must be in, amidst the confusion and dangers which surround you. I long to return and 
</p><p>
Without signature, which is often the case. administer all the consolation in my power, but when 
I shall have accomplished all the business I have to do here, I know not, and if it should be necessary to stay here till Christmas, or longer, in order 
to effect our purposes, I am determined patiently to wait 
</p><p>
Patience, forbearance, long suffering are the lessons taught here for our province, and at the same 
time, absolute and open resistance to the new Government. I wish I could convince gentlemen of the 
danger, or impracticability of this as fully as I believe it myself. The art and address of ambassadors 
from a dozen belligerent powers of Europe ; nay, of a conclave of cardinals at the election of a pope ; 
or of the princes in Germany at the choice of an Emperor, would not exceed the specimens we have 
seen ; yet the Congress all profess the same political principles. They all profess to consider our province, 
as suffering in the common cause, and indeed they seem to feel for us, as if for themselves. We have 
had as great questions to discuss as ever engaged the attention of men, and an infinite multitude of them. 
</p><p>
I received a very kind letter from Deacon Palmer, acquainting me with Mr. Cranch's designs of removing to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>, which I approve very much, and 
wish I had a house for every family in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, and 
abilities to provide for them in the country. I submit it to you, my dear, whether it would not be best 
to remove all the books, and papers, and furniture in 
the Office at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> up to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>. There will be no business there, nor any where, I suppose, and my young friends can study there better than in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> at present. 
</p><p>
I shall be killed with kindness in this place. We go to Congress at nine, and there we stay, most earnestly engaged in debates upon the most abstruse 
mysteries of state, until three in the afternoon ; then we adjourn, and go to dine with some of the nobles of Pennsylvania at four o clock, and feast upon ten 
thousand delicacies, and sit drinking Madeira, Claret and Burgundy till six or seven, and then go home 
fatigued to death with business, company, and care. Yet I hold it out surprisingly.

</p><p>
MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
I THANK you for all your kind favors, I wish I could write to you much oftener than I do. I wish I could 
write to you a dozen letters every day. But the business before me is so arduous, and takes up my time 
so entirely, that I cannot write often. I had the characters and tempers, the principles and views of 
fifty gentlemen, total strangers to me, to study, and 
the trade, policy, and whole interest of a dozen provinces to learn, when I came here. I have multitudes 
of pamphlets, newspapers, and private letters to read. 
I have numberless plans of policy and many arguments to consider. I have many visits to make and 
receive, much ceremony to endure, which cannot he avoided, which, you know, I hate. 
</p><p>
There is a great spirit in the Congress. But our people must be peaceable. Let them exercise every day in the week, if they will; the more, the better. 
Let them furnish themselves with artillery, arms, and ammunition. Let them follow the maxim, which you 
say they have adopted, "In times of peace prepare for war." But let them avoid war if possible if possible, I say. 
</p><p>
Mr. Revere, will bring you the doings of the Congress, who are now all around me, debating what advice to give to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> and the Massachusetts Bay. 
</p><p>
We are all well hope our family is so. Remember me to them all. I have advised you before, 
to remove my Office from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>. It is 
now, I think, absolutely necessary. Let the best care 
be taken of all books and papers. Tell all my clerks 
to mind their books and study hard, for their country 
will stand in need of able counsellors. I must give you 
a general license to make my compliments to all my 
friends, and acquaintances. I have not time to name 
them particularly. I wish they would all write to me. 
If they leave letters at Edes and GilPs, they will soon be sent to me. 
</p><p>
I long to be at home, but I cannot say when. I 
will never leave the Congress until it rises, and when 
it will rise, I cannot say. And indeed I cannot say but we are bettor here than any where. We have 
fine opportunities Ivcre to serve <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> and Massachusetts, by acquainting the whole continent with die 
true state of them. Our residence here greatly 
serves the cause. The spirit and principles of liberty here are greatly cherished by our presence and 
conversation. The elections of last week prove this. 
Mr. Dickinson was chosen, almost unanimously, a 
representative of the county. The broad-brims began an opposition to your friend Mr. Mifilin, because 
he was too warm, in the cause. This instantly alarmed the friends of liberty, and ended in the election of 
Mr. Milflin by eleven hundred votes out of thirteen, 
and in the election of our Secretary, Mr. Charles Thomson, to be a burgess with him. This is considered here as a most complete and decisive victory in 
favor of the American cause. And, it is said, it will change the balance in the Legislature here against 
Mr. Galloway, who has been supposed to sit on the skirts of the American advocates. 
</p><p>
Mrs. MifTlin, who is a charming Quaker girl, often inquires kindly after your health. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear wife. God bless you and yours ; so wishes and prays, without ceasing,

MY DEAR,
</p><p>
I AM wearied to death with the life I lead. The business of the Congress is tedious beyond expression. 
This assembly is like no other that ever existed. Every man in it is a great roan, an orator, a 
critic, a statesman ; and therefore, every man upon 
every question, must show his oratory, his criticism, and his political abilities. The consequence of 
this is, that business is drawn and spun out to an immeasurable length. I believe, if it was moved and 
seconded, that we should come to a resolution that three and two make five, we should be entertained 
with logic, and rhetoric, law, history, politics and mathematics, and then we should pass the resolution, 
unanimously, in the affirmative. The perpetual round of feasting too, which we are obliged to submit to, makes the pilgrimage more tedious to me. 
</p><p>
This day, I went to Dr. Allison's meeting in the 
forenoon, and heard the Dr. ; a good discourse upon 
the Lord's supper. This is a Presbyterian meet 
ing. I confess f am not fond of the Presbyterian 
meetings in this town. I had rather go to church. 
We have better sermons, better prayers, better speakers, softer, sweeter music, and genteeler company. 
And I must confess, that the Episcopal church is quite 
as agreeable to my taste as the Presbyterian. They are both slaves to the domination of the priesthood. 
I like the Congregational way best ; next to that, the Independent. 
</p><p>
This afternoon, led by a curiosity and good company, I strolled away to mother church, or rather, 
grandmother church. I mean the Romish Chapel. I 
heard a good, short, moral essay upon the duty of 
parents to their children founded in justice and charity, to take care of their interests, temporal and spiritual. This afternoon's entertainment was to me 
most awful and affecting. The poor wretches fingering 
their beads, chanting Latin, not a word of which 
they understood ; their pater-nosters and ave Marias ; their holy water ; their crossing themselves 
perpetually ; their bowing to the name of Jesus, 
wherever they hear it ; their bowings, and kneelings, and genuflections before the altar. The dress of the priest was rich with lace. His pulpit was velvet and gold. The altar-piece was very rich ; little images and crucifixes about ; wax candles lighted up. But how shall I describe the picture of our Saviour, in a frame of marble over the altar, at full 
length, upon the cross in the agonies, and the blood dropping and streaming from his wounds ! The mu 
sic, consisting of an organ and a choir of singers, went all the afternoon, except sermon time. And the assembly chanted most sweetly and exquisitely. 
</p><p>
Here is everything which can lay hold of the eye, ear, and imagination. Everything which can charm, 
and bewitch the simple and ignorant. I wonder how Luther ever broke the spell.

MR. ELIOT, of Fairfield, is this moment arrived, on

It is arrogance and presumption, in human sagacity, to pretend to penetrate far into the designs of Heaven. The most perfect reverence and resignation becomes 
us, but I cannot help depending upon this, that the present dreadful calamity of that beloved town, is in 
tended to bind the colonies together in more indissoluble bonds, and to animate their exertions at this great crisis in the affairs of mankind. It has this

MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
DOCTOR CHURCH returns to-day, and, with smarting 
eyes, I must write a few lines to you. I never had 
in my life such severe duty to do, and was never 
worse qualified to do it. My eyes depress my spirits, 
and my health is quite infirm. Yet I keep about, 
and attend Congress very constantly. 
</p><p>
I wish I could write freely to you, my dear, but I 
cannot. The scene before me is complicated enough. 
It requires better eyes, and better nerves than mine ; 
yet I will not despond. I will lay all difficulties prostrate at my feet. My health and life ought to be hazarded in the cause of my country, as well as your's, and all my friends. 
</p><p>
It is impossible to convey, to you any adequate idea of the embarrassments I am under. I wish that 
you and our friends may not be in greater distress than I am. I fear you arc. Pray let me know as 
often as possible. Our friends write to Mr. , not to me, this time. They Don't let us know the state of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> people, nor the state of the army in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, BO exactly as I could wish. 
</p><p>
Two days ago we saw a very wonderful phenomenon in this city ; a field day, on which three battalions of soldiers were reviewed, making full two 
thousand men, battalion men, light infantry, grenadiers, riflemen, light horse, artillery men with a fine 
train, all in uniforms, going through the manual exercise, and the manoeuvres, with remarkable dexterity. AH this has been accomplished in this city since 
the 19th of April ; so sudden a formation of an army never took place any where. 
</p><p>
In Congress we are bound to secrecy. But, under the rose, I believe that ten thousand men will be maintained in the Massachusetts, and five thousand in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, at the continental expense. 
</p><p>
We have a major Skene, just arrived from London with a commission to be Governor of Crown Point 
and Ticonderoga, and surveyor of the woods, &c., a close prisoner. He must dispute for his government with Arnold and Allen.

My love and duty where due.

MY DEAR,
</p><p>
DH. CHURCH has given me a lotion which has helped 
my eyes so much that I hope you will hear from me 
oftener than you have done. Pray write me as often 
and particularly as possible. Send your letters to the 
care of the Committee of Safety, who will forward 
them. I long to know how you fare, and whether 
you are often discomposed with alarms. Guard your- 
</p><p>
self against them, my dear. I think you are in no 
danger. Don't let the groundless fears and fruitful 
imaginations of others affect you. Let me know 
what guards are kept ; and who were principally concerned in the battle I at Grape Island, as well as 
that at Chelsea. The reputation of our country 
men for valor is very high. I hope they will maintain it, as well as that for prudence, caution, and conduct. 
</p><p>
When I shall come home I know not. We have business enough before us, to detain us until the 31st 
of next December. No assembly ever had a greater number of great objects before them. Provinces, 
Nations, Empires are small things before us. I wish we were good architects.

MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
I HAVE been this morning to hear Mr. Duffield, a preacher in this city, whose principles, prayers and sermons, 
more nearly resemble those of our New England 
clergy, than any that I have heard. His discourse 
was a kind of exposition on the thirty-fifth chapter 
of Isaiah. America was the wilderness, and the solitary place, and he said it would be glad, u rejoice 
and blossom as the rose." He laboured " to strengthen 
the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees." He 
" said to them that were of a fearful heart, Be strong, 
fear not. Behold, your God will come with vengeance, 
even God with a recompense ; he will come and save 
you." u No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast 
shall go up thereon, but the redeemed shall walk 
there, &c." He applied the whole prophecy to this 
country, and gave us as animating an entertainment 
as I ever heard. He filled and swelled the bosom 
of every hearer. I hope you have received a letter, 
in which I inclosed you a pastoral letter from the 
synod of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> ; by this you 
will see, that the Clergy this way are but now beginning to engage in politics, and they engage with a 
fervor that will produce wonderful effects. 
</p><p>
17 June. 
</p><p>
I can now inform you, that the Congress have made 
choice of the modest and virtuous, the amiable, generous and brave George Washington, Esquire, to be 
General of the American army, and that he is to re 
pair, as soon as possible, to the camp before <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. 
This appointment will have a great effect in cement 
ing and securing the union of these colonies. The 
continent is really in earnest, in defending the country. They have voted ten companies of riflemen to 
be sent from Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia, to join the army before <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. These are an excellent species of light infantry. They use a peculiar kind of musket, called a rifle. It has circular or grooves 
within the barrel, an^l carries a ball with great exactness to great distances. They are the most accurate marksmen in the world. 
</p><p>
I begin to hope we shall not sit all summer. I 
hope the people of our province will treat the General 
with all that confidence and affection, that politeness 
and respect, which is due to one of the most important characters in the world. The liberties of America depend upon him, in a great degree. I have never 
been able to obtain from our province any regular and 
particular intelligence, since I left it. Kent, Swift, Tudor, Dr. Cooper, Dr. Winthrop and others wrote me often last fall ; not a line from them this time. 
</p><p>
I have found this Congress like the last. When 
we first came together, I found a strong jealousy of us 
from New England, and the Massachusetts in particular. Suspicions entertained of designs of independency ; an American republic ; prcsbyterian principles, and twenty other things. Our sentiments were 
heard in Congress with great caution, and seemed to 
make but little impression ; but the longer we sat, 
the more clearly they saw the necessity of pushing 
vigorous measures. It has been so now. Every day 
we sit, the more we are convinced that the designs 
against us are hostile and sanguinary, and that no 
thing but fortitude, vigor, and perseverance can save us. 
But America is a great unwieldy body. Its progress must be slow. It is like a large fleet sailing 
under convoy. The fleetest sailers must wait for the 
dullest and slowest. Like a coach and six, the 
swiftest horses must be slackened, and the slowest 
quickened, that all may keep an even pace. 
</p><p>
It is long since I heard from you. I fear you have been kept in continual alarms. My duty and love to all. My dear children, come here and kiss 
me. We have appointed a continental fast. Millions will be upon their knees at once before their great 
Creator, imploring his forgiveness and blessing ; his smiles on American councils and arms. 
</p><p>
My duty to your uncle Quincy ; your papa, mamma, and mine ; my brothers and sisters, and yours.
 
Adieu.

MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
I HAVE this morning been out of town, to accompany 
our Generals, Washington, Lee and Schuyler, a little 
way on their journey to the American camp, before 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. The three Generals were all mounted on 
horse-back, accompanied by Major Milliin, who is 
gone in the character of Aid-de-camp. All the 
delegates from the Massachusetts^ with their servants 
and carriages, attended. Many others of the delegates 
from the Congress ; a large troop of light horse in 
their uniforms ; many officers of militia, besides, in 
their's ; music playing, &c. &c. Such is the pride and 
pomp of war. I, poor creature, worn out with scribbling for my bread and my liberty, low in spirits and 
weak in health, must leave others to wear the laurels 
which I have sown ; others to eat the bread which I have earned ; a common case. 
</p><p>
We had, yesterday, by the way of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and 
New London, a report which distresses us almost as 
much as that we had last fall, of the cannonade of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. A battle at Bunker's hill, and Dorchester 
point Three Colonels wounded, Gardner mortally. 
We wait to hear more particulars. Our hopes and 
fears are, alternately, very strong. If there is any 
truth in this account, you must be in great confusion. 
God Almighty's providence preserve, sustain, and comfort you.

This moment received two letters from you. 
Courage, my dear. We shall be supported in life

men behaved so bravely, though not so skilfully con 
ducted as I could wish. I hope this defect will be 
remedied by the new modelling of the army.

</p><p>
MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
I HAVE received your very agreeable favors of June 22 and 25. They contain more particulars than any letters I had before received from anybody. 
</p><p>
It is not at all surprising to me, that the wanton, 
cruel, and infamous conflagration of Charlestown, the 
place of your father's nativity, should afllict him. 
Let him know that I sincerely condole with him on that 
melancholy event. It is a method of conducting war 
long since become disreputable among civilized nations. But every year brings us fresh evidence that 
we have nothing to hope for, from our loving mother 
country, but cruelties more abominable than those which are practised by the savage Indians. 
</p><p>
The account you give me of the numbers slain on 
the side of our enemies, is afflicting to humanity, 
although it is a glorious proof of the bravery of our 
worthy countrymen. Considering all the disadvantages under which they fought, they really exhibited 
prodigies of valor. Your description of the distresses 
of the worthy inhabitants of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> and the other 
seaport towns, is enough to melt a heart of stone. 
Our consolation must be this, my dear, that cities may be rebuilt, and a people, reduced to poverty, may 
acquire fresh property. But a constitution of government, once changed from freedom, can never be re 
stored. Liberty once lost, is lost forever. When the 
people once surrender their share in the Legislature, 
and their right of defending the limitations upon the 
Government, and of resisting every encroachment upon them, they can never regain it. 
</p><p>
The loss of Mr. Mather's library, which was a collection of books and manuscripts made by himself, his 
father, his grandfather, and great-grandfather, and 
was really very curious and valuable, is irreparable. 
The family picture you draw is charming indeed. 
My dear Abby, Johnny, Charley and Tommy, I long 
to see you, and to share with your mamma the pleasures of your conversation. I feel myself much 
obliged to Mr. Bowdoin, Mr. Wibird and the two families you mention for their civilities to you. My compliments to them. Does Mr. Wibird preach against 
oppression and the other cardinal vices of the times ? 
Tell him, the clergy here of every denomination, not 
excepting the Episcopalian, thunder and lighten every 
Sabbath. They pray for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> and the Massachusetts. They thank God most explicitly and fervently 
for our remarkable successes. They pray for the American army. They seem to feel as if they were among you. 
</p><p>
You ask if every member feels for us? Every 
member says he does, and most of them really do. But 
most of them feel more for themselves. In every 
society of men, in every club I ever yet saw, you find 
</p><p>
some who are timid, their fears hurry them away up 
on every alarm. Some who are selfish and avaricious, on whose callous hearts nothing but interest and money can make impression. There are some 
persons in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, to whom a 
ship is dearer than a city, and a few barrels of flour 
than a thousand lives other men's lives, I mean. 
</p><p>
You ask, can they realize what we suffer ? I 
answer, no. They can t. They don t. And, to excuse them as well as I can, I must confess, I should 
not be able to do it myself, if I was not more acquainted with it by experience than they are. 
</p><p>
I am grieved fur Dr. Tuffs ill health, but rejoiced exceedingly at his virtuous exertions in the cause of his 
country. I am happy to hear that my brothers were 
at Grape Island, and behaved well. My love to them, 
and duty to my mother. 
</p><p>
It gives me more pleasure than I can express, to 
learn that you sustain with so much fortitude, the 
shocks and terrors of the times. You are really 
brave, my dear. You are a heroine, and you have reason to be. For the worst that can happen, can do 
you no harm. A soul as pure, as benevolent, as virtuous and pious as yours, has nothing to fear, but 
everything to hope and expect from the last of human 
evils. I am glad you have secured an asylum, though I hope you will not have occasion for it. 
</p><p>
There is an amiable, ingenious hussy, named Betsey Smith, for whom I have a very great regard. Be pleased to make my love acceptable to her, and let her know 
that her elegant pen cannot be more usefully employed than in writing letters to her brother at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, though it may be more agreeably, in writing 
billets-doux to young gentlemen. 
</p><p>
The other day, after I had received a letter of yours, with one or two others, Mr. William Barrell 
desired to read them. I put them into his hand, and the next morning had them returned in a large bundle 
packed up with two great heaps of pins, with a very polite card requesting Portia's acceptance of them. I I 
shall bring them with me when I return. But when that will be, is uncertain. I hope, not more than a month hence. 
</p><p>
I have really had a very disagreeable time of it My health, and especially my eyes, have been so very 
bad, that I have not been so fit for business as I ought, and if I had been in perfect health,! should have had, 
in the present condition of my country and my friends, no taste for pleasure. But Dr. Young has made a kind of cure of my health, and Dr. Church of my eyes. 
</p><p>
I have received two kind letters from your uncle Smith. Do thank him for them. I shall forever love 
him for them. I love everybody that writes to me. I am, forever yours.

MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
You have more than once, in your letters, I mentioned 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="met colleague">Dr. Franklin</a>, and in one, intimated a desire that I 
should write you something concerning him. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="met colleague">Dr. Franklin</a> has Been very constant in his attendance on Congress from the beginning. His conduct has been composed and grave, and, in the opinion of many gentlemen, very reserved. He has not 
assumed any thing, nor affected to take the lead ; 
but has seemed to choose that the Congress should 
pursue their own principles and sentiments, and 
adopt their own plans. Yet he has not been back 
ward ; has been very useful on many occasions, and 
discovered a disposition entirely American. lie does 
not hesitate at our boldest measures, but rather seems 
to think us too irresolute and backward. He thinks 
us at present in an odd state, neither in peace nor 
war, neither dependent nor independent ; but he 
thinks that we shall soon assume a character more de- 
He thinks that we have the power of pre 
serving ourselves ; and that even if we should be 
driven to the disagreeable necessity of assuming a total independency, and set up a separate state, we can 
maintain it. The people of England have thought that the opposition in America, was wholly owing to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="met colleague">Dr. Franklin</a> ; and I suppose their scribblers will at 
tribute the temper and proceedings of Congress to j 
him ; but there cannot be a greater mistake. He 
has had but little share, further than to cooperate 
and to assist. He is however a great and good man. 
I wish his colleagues from this city were all like him ; 
particularly one, I whose abilities and virtues, formerly 
trumpeted so much in America, have been found 
wanting. There is a young gentleman from Pennsylvania, whose name is Wilson, whose fortitude, rectitude and abilities too, greatly outshine his master's. 
Mr. Biddle, the Speaker, has been taken off by sickness, Mr. Mifllin is gone to the camp, Mr. Morton is 
ill too, so that this province has suffered by the timidity of two overgrown fortunes. The dread of confiscation or caprice, I know not what, has influenced 
them too much ; yet they were for taking arms, and pretended to be very valiant.

This letter must be secret, my dear ; at least, communicated with great discretion.

MY DEAR,
</p><p>
Tins letter is intended to go by my friend Mr. William Barrcll, whom I believe you have seen in Bos 
ton. If he calls at our house you will please to receive him complaisantly, and thank him for your 
present of pins. I have been treated by him with great civility, both at this, and the former Congress. 
</p><p>
This day I have heard my parish priest, Mr. Dufficld, This gentleman never 
fails to adapt his discourse to the times. He pressed 
upon his audience the necessity of piety and virtue 
in the present times of adversity, and held up to their 
view the army before <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, as an example. He 
understood, he said, that the voice of the swearer was 
scarcely heard ; that the Sabbath was well observed, 
and all immoralities discountenanced. No doubt there 
were vicious individuals, but the general character 
was good. I hope this good man's information 
is true, and that this will become more and more the 
true character of that camp. You may well suppose 
that this language was exceedingly pleasing to me. 
</p><p>
We have nothing new, but the arrival of some powder. Three little vessels have certainly arrived, making about ten tons in the whole, and four or five tons 
have arrived from South Carolina. A supply, I think 
now we shall certainly obtain. Congress have taken measures for this end, which I hope to hare the pleasure of explaining to you, in person, within a few days, 
as Congress have determined to adjourn to some time I in September. I could not vote for this myself, be 
cause I thought it might be necessary to keep together ; but I could not blame those who did, for really 
we have been all so assiduous in business, in this exhausting, debilitating climate, that our lives are more 
exposed than they would be in camp. Love to the children.

MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
THIS morning I received your two letters of 8 September and 16 September. What shall I say ? The 
intelligence they contain came upon me by surprise, as I never had the least intimation before, that any of 
my family was ill, excepting in a card from Mrs. Warren, received a few days ago, in which she in 
formed me, that Mrs. Adams had been unwell, but was better. 
</p><p>
You may easily conceive the state of mind in which I am at present. Uncertain and apprehensive, 
at first, I suddenly thought of setting off immediately for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>, and I have not yet determined other 
wise. Yet the state of public affairs is so critical, that I am half afraid to leave my station, although my presence here is of no great consequence. 
</p><p>
I feel, I tremble for you. Poor Tommy ! I hope, by this time, however, he has recovered his plump 
cheeks, and his fine tyloom. By your account of Patty, I fear, but still I will hope she has been supported, 
and is upon the recovery. I rejoice to learn that Abby and her brothers have hitherto escaped, and 
pray God that his goodness may be still continued to them. Your description of the distressed state of the 
neighbourhood is affecting indeed. It is not uncommon for a train of calamities to come together. Fire, 
sword, pestilence, famine often keep company and visit a country in a flock. 
</p><p>
At this distance I can do no good to you or your's, I pray God to support you. I hope our friends and 
neighbours are kind as usual. I feel for them in the general calamity. I am so far from thinking you 
melancholy, that I am charmed with that admirable fortitude, and that divine spirit of resignation, which 
appear in your letters. I cannot express the satisfaction it gives me, nor how much it contributes to sup port me. 
</p><p>
You have alarmed me, however, by mentioning 
anxieties which you do not think it proper to mention 
to any one. I am wholly at a loss to conjecture what 
they can be. If they arise from the letters, be assured 
that you may banish them forever. These letters
have reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, hut have produced effects 
very different from those which were expected from 
the publication of them. These effects I will explain 
to you sometime or other. As to the versification of 
them, if there is wit or humor in it, laugh if ill 
nature, sneer if mere dulness, why you may even 
yawn or nod. I have no anger at it, nay even scarcely contempt. It is impotent 
</p><p>
As to politics, we have nothing to expect hut the 
whole wrath and force of Great Britain. But your 
words are as true as an oracle," God helps them who 
help themselves, and if we obtain the divine aid by 
our own virtue, fortitude and perseverance, we may 
he sure of relief." It may amuse you to hear a 
story. A few days ago, in company with Dr. Zubly, 
somebody said, there was nobody on our side but the 
Almighty. The Doctor, I who is a native of Switzerland, 
and speaks but broken English, quickly replied, " Dat 
is enough. Dat is enough ;" and, turning to me, says 
he, " It puts me in mind of a fellow who once said, 
The Catholics have on their side the Pope, and the 
King of France, and the King of Spain, and the King 
of Sardinia, and the King of Poland, and the Emperor of Germany, 5cc., ice., &c. But as to those poor devils, the protestan's, they have nothing on their side but God Almighty."

</p><p>
EVERYTHING here is in as good a way as I could wish, 
considering the temper and designs of Administration. 
I assure you, the letters have had no such bad effects 
as the Tories intended, and as some of our short 
sighted Whigs apprehended ; so far otherwise, that I 
see and hear, every day, fresh proofs that everybody 
is coming fast into every political sentiment contained in them. I assure you L could mention compliments passed upon them, and if a serious decision 
could be had upon them, the public voice would be found in their favor. 
</p><p>
But I am distressed with cares of another kind. 
Your two letters are never out of my thoughts. I 
should have mounted my horse, this day, for Braintrce, 
if I had not hopes of hearing further from you in a day or two. However, I will hope that your prospects are more agreeable than they were, and that the 
children are all better, as well as the rest of the family, and the neighbours. If I should hear more disagreeable advices from you, I shall certainly come 
home, for I cannot leave you in such affliction without endeavouring to lessen it, unless there was an absolute 
necessity of my staying here to do a duty to the public, which I think there is not 
</p><p>
I must beg to be excused, my dear, from hinting at anything for the future, of public persons or things. 
Secrecy is so much exacted. But thus much I may say, that I never saw so serious and determined a 
spirit. I must also beseech you to be cautious what you write to me and by whom you send. Letters sent to the care of Colonel Warren will come safe. 
My. regards, with all proper distinctions, to my relations and yours, my friends and yours, my acquaintances and yours.

This will go by Major Bayard, a gentleman of the Presbyterian persuasion in this city, of excellent character, to whom I am indebted for a great many civilities.

MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
YESTERDAY, by the post, I received yours of 25 September. And it renewed a grief and anxiety, that 
were, before, almost removed from my mind. Two 
days before, I had the pleasure of a very valuable 
letter from Colonel Quincy, in which he kindly in 
formed me, that you and our family were so much better, that you and my dear Abby had made a visit 
at his house ; and Mr. Williams, who brought the let- 
&gt; ter, acquainted me, that he had been to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a> after 
</p><p>
the date of it, that you was in good spirits, that 
Tommy was so much better as to be playing abroad, 
and that he hoped Patty was not in danger. You will 
easily believe that this information gave me great 
pleasure and fine spirits. It really relieved me from 
n heavy load. But your last letter has revived my 
concern. I will still hope, however, that your excel 
lent mother will yet be spared for a blessing to her 
family, and an example to the world. I build my 
hopes of her recovery upon the advantage of a constitution which has hitherto sustained so many attacks v 
and upon a long course of exact temperance, which, 
I hope, has deprived the distemper of its most dangerous food and fuel. However, our lives are not in our own power. It is our duty to submit. " The ways 
of Heaven are dark and intricate," its designs are 
often inscrutable, but are always wise and just and : good. 
</p><p>
It was long before I had the least intimation of the 
distress of the family, and I fear, that your not receiving so many letters from me as usual, may have 
been one cause of infelicity to you. Really, my dear, 
I have been more cautious than I used to be. It is 
not easy to know whom to trust in these times ; and 
if a letter, from any person in the situation I am in, 
can be laid hold of, there are so many lies made and 
told about it, so many false copies taken and dispersed, and so many false constructions put, that one ought to be cautious. 
</p><p>
The situation of things ia so alarming, that it is our 
duty to prepare our minds and hearts for every event* 
even the worst From my earliest entrance into life, 
I have been engaged in the public cause of America ; 
and from first to lost, I have had upon my mind a 
strong impression that things would be wrought up to 
their present crisis. I saw, from the beginning, that 
the controversy was of such a nature, that it never 
would be settled, and every day convinces me more 
and more. This has been the source of all the disquietude of my life. It has Iain down and risen up 
with me these twelve years. The thought, that we 
might be driven to the sad necessity of breaking our 
connexion with Great Britain, exclusive of the carnage and destruction, which, it was easy to see, must 
attend the separation, always gave me a great deal of 
grief. And even now, I would cheerfully retire from 
public life forever, renounce all chance for profits or 
honors from the public, nay, I would cheerfully con 
tribute my little property, to obtain peace and liberty. 
But all these must go, and my life too, before I can 
surrender the right of my country to a free Constitution. I dare not consent to it. I should be the most 
miserable of mortals ever after, whatever honors or emoluments might surround me.

I AM much concerned lest you should feel an addition to your anxieties, from your having so seldom heard from me. But I pray you to dismiss all concern 
about me. I am happier far, than I was before the adjournment. My health is better, and business and conversation are much more to my taste.

The surprising intelligence we have in private letters concerning the Director of the Hospital, I has made 
me more cautious of writing than ever. I must be excused from writing a syllable of anything of any

afraid to trust private travellers. They may peep. Accidents may happen ; and I would avoid, if I could, even ridicule, but especially mischief.

Pray, bundle up every paper, not already hid, and conceal them in impenetrable darkness. Nobody knows what may occur.

I THIS day received yours of the 29th of September 
and the 1st of October. Amidst ail your afflictions, 
I am rejoiced to find that you all along preserve so 
proper and so happy a temper ; that you are sensible 
" the consolations of religion are the only sure comforters." It is the constitution under which we are 
born, that if we live long ourselves, we must bury 
our parents, and all our elder relations, and many of 
those who are younger. I have lost a parent, a child 
and a brother, and each of them left a lasting impression on my mind. But you and I have many 
more relations and very good friends to follow to the 
house appointed for all flesh, or else we must be followed by them. I bewail, more than I can express, 
the loss of your excellent mother. I mourn the loss 
of so much purity, and unaffected piety and virtue, 
to tho world. I know of no better character left in 
it I grieve for you, and your brother and sisters. I 
grieve for your father, whose age will need the succor of so excellent a companion. But I grieve for 
nobody more than my children. Her most amiable 
and discreet example, as well as her kind skill and 
care, I have ever relied upon in my own mind, for 
the education of these little swarms. Not that I have 
not a proper esteem for the capacity and disposition 
</p><p>
of the mother, but I know that the efforts of the 
grandmother are of great importance, when they 
second those of the parent. And I am sure that my 
children are the better for the forming hand of their 
grandmother. It gives me great joy to learn that ours 
are well. Let us be thankful for this, and many 
other blessings yet granted us. Pray, my dear, 
cherish in their minds the remembrance of their grandmamma, and remind them of her precepts and 
example. God Almighty grant to you and to every 
branch of the family, all the support that you want. 
You and I, my dear, have reason, if ever mortals 
had, to be thoughtful ; to look forward beyond the transitory scene. Whatever is preparing for us, let us be 
prepared to receive. It is time for us to subdue our 
passions of every kind. The prospect before us is 
an ocean of uncertainties, in which no pleasing objects 
appear. We have few hopes, excepting that of pre 
serving our honor and our consciences untainted, and 
a free Constitution to our country. Let me be sure 
of these, and, amidst all my weaknesses, I cannot be 
overcome. With these, I can be happy in extreme 
poverty, in humble insignificance, may I hope and 
believe, in death : Without them, I should be miserable with a crown upon my head, millions in my coiTbrs and a gaping, idolizing multitude at my feet. 
</p><p>
My heart is too full of grief for you and our friends, 
to whom I wish you to present my regards, to say 
anything of news or politics. Yet the affair of the 
Surgeon-General is so strange and important an event, 
that I cannot close this gloomy letter without adding 
a sigh for this imprudent, unfortunate man. I know 
not whether the evidence will support the word 
treachery, but what may we not expect after treachery to himself, his wife and children ?

</p><p>
IT is some time since I wrote you, and I have nothing 
now to write, but repetitions of respect and affection. I 
am anxious to hear from you. I hope the family is 
better ; that your grief for the great loss we have all 
sustained is somewhat abated. I hope your father 
and sister Betsey are well, though they must be 
greatly afflicted. Give my love to Betsey, and let 
her know that I feel most intimately for her, as well 
as for myself and the rest. I consider the stroke 
must fall heavier upon her, as it was nearer to her. 
Her prosperity is near my heart. I wish her every 
blessing which she can possibly wish for herself. 
</p><p>
Really it is very painful to be four hundred miles 
from one's family and friends, when we know they 
are in affliction. It seems as if it would be a joy to me 
to fly home, even to share with you your burdens and 
misfortunes. Surely, if I were with you, it would be 
my study to allay your griefs, to mitigate your pains, 
and to divert your melancholy thoughts. When I 
</p><p>
shall come home, I know not. We have so much to 
do, and it is so difficult to do it right, that \vc must 
learn patience. Upon my word, I think, if ever I 
were to come here again, I must bring you with me. 
I could live here pleasantly, if I had you with me. 
W T ill you come and have the small pox I here ? I 
wish I could remove all the family, our little daughter 
and sons, and all go through the distemper here. 
What if we should ? Let me please myself with the 
thought however. 
</p><p>
Congress has appointed Mr. Wythe, Mr. Deanc 
and me, a Committee to collect an account of the hostilities committed by the troops and ships, with proper 
evidence of the number and value of the houses and 
other buildings destroyed or damaged, the vessels captivated, and the cattle, sheep, hogs, &c., taken. We 
are about writing to all the general assemblies of New 
England, and to many private gentlemen in each 
colony, to assist us in making the collections. The 
gentlemen with me are able men. Deane's character, you know. He is a very ingenious man and an 
able politician. Wythe is a new member from Virginia, a lawyer of the highest eminence in that pro 
vince, a learned and very laborious man ; so that we 
may hope this commission will be well executed. A 
tale of woe it will be ! Such a scene of distress and 
destruction, and so patiently and magnanimously 
borne ! Such a scene of cruelty and barbarity, so 
unfeelingly committed ! I mention this to you, my dear, that you may look up, and transmit to me, a 
paper which Colonel Palmer lent me, containing a relation of the Charlestown battle, which was transmit 
ted to England by the Committee of safety. This paper I must have, or a copy of it. 
</p><p>
I wish I could collect, from the people of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> or others, a proper set of paintings of the scenes of distress and misery brought upon that town from the 
commencement of the Port bill. Posterity must hear a story that shall make their ears to tingle.

</p><p>
YESTERDAY, yours of October 9th came to hand. Your 
letters never failed to give me pleasure. The greatest 
pleasure that I take, is in receiving them. And although 
every one, which has yet come to hand, is replete with 
melancholy tidings, yet I can truly say, I never was 
so earnest to receive them. I rejoice in the happy 
principles and the happy temper which apparently dictated them all. 
</p><p>
I feel myself much affected with the breach upon 
the family. But we can count a mother, a brother, 
an aunt, and a brother's child among the slain by this 
cruel pestilence. May God Almighty put a stop to its rage and humble us under the ravages already 
made by it. The sorrows of all our friends, on the I loss of your mother, are never out of my mind. I pray God to spare my parent, whose life has been 
prolonged by his goodness hitherto, as well as yours 
that survives. The tremendous calamities already 
felt of fire, sword and pestilence may be only harbingers of greater still. We have no security against 
calamity here. This planet is its region. The only 
principle is to be prepared for the worst events. 
</p><p>
If I could write as well as you, my sorrow would 
be as eloquent as yours, but, upon my word, I cannot. 
</p><p>
The unaccountable event, which you allude to, has 
reached this place and occasioned a fall. I would be 
glad, however, that the worst construction might not be 
put. Let him l have fair play ; though I doubt. 
</p><p>
The man who violates private faith, cancels solemn 
obligations, whom neither honor nor conscience holds, 
shall never be knowingly trusted by me. Had I 
known, when I first voted for a Director of an Hospital, 
what I heard afterwards, when I was down, I would 
not have voted as I did. Open, barefaced immorality 
ought not to be so countenanced. Though I think a 
fatality attends us in some instances, yet a divine protection and favor is visible in others ; and let us be 
cheerful, whatever happens. Cheerfulness is not a sin in any times. 
</p><p>
I am afraid to hear again almost, lest some other should be sick in the house. V Yet I hope better, and 
that you will reassume your wonted cheerfulness and write again upon news and politics. Send your letters to Warren for conveyance. I won t trust any other.

</p><p>
I CANNOT exclude from my mind your melancholy 
situation. The griefs of your father and sisters, your 
uncles and aunts, as well as the remoter connexions, 
often crowd in upon me, when my whole attention 
ought to be directed to other subjects. Your uncle 
Quincy, my friend as well as uncle, must regret the 
loss of a beloved sister. Doctor Tufts, my other 
friend, I know, bewails the loss of a friend, as well as 
an aunt and a sister. Mr. C ranch, the friend of my 
youth, as well as of my riper years, whose tender 
heart sympathizes with his fellow creatures in every affliction and distress, in this case, feels the loss of a 
friend, a fellow Christian and a mother. But, alas ! 
what avail these mournful reflections ? The best thing 
we can do, the greatest respect we can show to the memory of our departed friend, is to copy into our 
own lives, those virtues which, in her lifetime, rendered her the object of our esteem, love and admiration. I must confess, I ever felt a veneration for her, which seems increased by the news of her translation. 
</p><p>
Above all things, my dear, let us inculcate these great virtues and bright excellencies upon our children. 
</p><p>
Your mother had a clear and penetrating under 
standing, and a profound judgment, as well as an 
honest, and a friendly and a charitable heart. There is 
one thing, however, which you will forgive me if I 
hint to you. Let me ask you rather, if you are not I 
of my opinion ? Were not her talents and virtues 
too much confined to private, social and domestic life ? 
My opinion of the duties of religion and morality 
comprehends a very extensive connexion with society 
at large and the great interests of the public. Does 
not natural morality and much more Christian benevolence make it our indispensable duty to lay ourselves 
out to serve our fellow Creatures, to tho utmost, of our 
power, in promoting and supporting those great political systems and general regulations, upon which the 
happiness of multitudes depends ? The benevolence, 
charity, capacity and industry which, exerted in private life, would make a family, a parish or a town 
happy, employed upon a larger scale, in support of the great principles of virtue and freedom of political 
regulations, might secure whole nations and generations from misery, want and contempt. Public virtues and political qualities therefore should be incessantly cherished in our children.

</p><p>
HUMAN nature with all its infirmities and depravation 
is still capable of great things. It is capable of attaining to degrees of wisdom and of goodness, which, 
we have reason to believe, appear respectable in the 
estimation of superior intelligences. Education makes 
a greater difference between man and man, than nature has made between man and brute. The virtues 
and powers to which men may be trained, by early 
education and constant discipline, are truly sublime 
and astonishing. Newton and Locke are examples 
of the deep sagacity which may be acquired by long 
habits of thinking and study. Nay, your common mechanics and artisans are proofs of the wonderful dexterity acquired by use ; a watchmaker, in. finishing 
his wheels and springs, a pin or needlemaker, &c. I 
think there is a particular occupation in Europe, 
which is called a paper-stainer or linen-stainer. A 
man who has been long habituated to it, shall sit for 
a whole day, and draw upon paper fresh figures to be 
imprinted upon the papers for rooms, as fast as his 
eye can roll, and his fingers move, and no two of his 
</p><p>
draughts shall be alike. The Saracens, the Knights 
of Malta, the army and navy in the service of the 
English republic, among many others, are instances 
to show, to what an exalted height valor or bravery 
or courage may be raised, by artificial means. 
</p><p>
It should be your care, therefore, and mine, to elevate the minds of our children and exalt their courage ; to accelerate and animate their industry and 
activity ; to excite in them an habitual contempt of meanness, abhorrence of injustice and inhumanity, 
and an ambition to excel in every capacity, faculty and virtue. If we suffer their minds to grovel and creep in infancy, they will grovel all their lives. 
</p><p>
But their bodies must be hardened, as well as their souls exalted. Without strength and activity and 
vigor of body, the brightest mental excellencies will be eclipsed and obscured.

</p><p>
THERE is in the human breast, a social affection, which 
extends to our whole species, faintly indeed, but in 
some degree. The nation, kingdom or community 
to which we belong is embraced by it more vigorously. It is stronger still towards the province to 
which we "Belong, and in which we had our birth. It is stronger and stronger as we descend to the county, 
town, parish, neighbourhood and family, which we call 
our own. And here we find it often so powerful, as 
to become partial, to blind our eyes, to darken our 
understandings, and pervert our wills. 
</p><p>
It is to this infirmity in my own heart, that I must 
perhaps attribute that local attachment, that partial 
fondness, that overweening prejudice in favor of New 
England, which I feel very often, and which, I fear, 
sometimes leads me to expose myself to just ridicule. 
</p><p>
New England has, in many respects, the advantage 
of every other colony in America, and, indeed, of 
every other part of the world that I know any thing 
of.
</p><p>
1. The people are purer English blood ; less mixed 
with Scotch, Irish, Dutch, French, Danish, Swedish, 
&c., than any other ; and descended from English 
men too, who left Europe in purer times than the 
present, and less tainted with corruption than those 
they left behind them. 
</p><p>
2. The institutions in New England for the support 
of religion, morals and decency exceed any other ; 
obliging every parish to have a minister, and every 
person to go to meeting, &c. 
</p><p>
3. The public institutions in New England for the 
education of youth, supporting colleges at the pub 
lic expense, and obliging towns to maintain grammar 
schools, are not equalled, and never were, in any part 
of the world. 
</p><p>
4. The division of our territory, that is, our coun 
ties, into townships ; empowering towns to assemble, 
</p><p>
choose officers, make laws, mend roads and twenty 
other things, gives every man an opportunity of show 
ing and improving that education, which he received 
at college or at school, and makes knowledge and 
dexterity at public business common. 
</p><p>
5. Our law for the distribution of intestate estates 
occasions a frequent division of landed property and 
prevents monopolies of hind. 
</p><p>
But in opposition to these we have labored under many disadvantages. The exorbitant prerogative 
of our Governors, &c., which would have overborne our liberties, if it had not been opposed by the five preceding particulars.

These letters, and indeed every line from you, give

I can't write as often as I wish. I am engaged

hung up in Mrs. Hancock's chamber with great splendor and elegance. That lady sends her compliments

behaviour is easy and genteel. She avoids talking 
upon politics. In large and mixed companies she is 
totally silent, as a lady ought to be ; but whether her 
eyes are so penetrating, and her attention so quick to

company, as yours would be, saucy as you are this way, I won t say.

MY BEST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YOURS of November 12th I is before me. I wish I 
could write you every day, more than once, for 
although I have a number of friends and many relations, who are very dear to me, yet all the friendship 
I have for others is far unequal to that which warms my heart for you. The most agreeable time that I 
spend here is in writing to you, and conversing with you, when I am alone. But the call of friendship 
and of private affection must give place to that of duty and honor. Even private friendship and affections require it. 
</p><p>
I am obliged, by the nature of the service I am in, 
to correspond with many gentlemen, both of the army 
and of the two houses of Assembly, which takes up 
much of my time. How I find time to write half the 
letters I do, I know not, for my whole time seems en 
grossed with business. The whole Congress is taken 
up, almost, in different committees, from seven to ten 
in the morning. From ten to four or sometimes five, 
we are in Congress, and from six to ten, in committees 
again. I Don't mention this to make you think me a 
man of importance, because it is not I alone," but the whole Congress is thus employed, but to apologize for not writing to you oAener. 
</p><p>
Indeed I know not what to write that is worth your 
reading. I send you the papers, which inform you of 
what is public. As to what passes in Congress, I 
am tied fast by my honor to communicate nothing. I 
hope the Journal of the Session will be published 
soon, and then you will see what we have been about 
in one view, excepting what ought to be excepted. If 
I could visit the coffee-houses in the evening, and the 
coffee-tables of the ladies in the afternoon, I could 
entertain you with mary smart remarks upon dress 
and air, &c., and give you many sprightly conversations, but my fate, you know, is to be moping over 
books and papers all the leisure time I have, when I 
have any. 
</p><p>
I hope I shall be excused from coming to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> again, at least until other gentlemen have taken 
their turns. But I never will come here again without you, if I can persuade you to come with me. Whom God has joined together ought not to be put asunder 
so long, with their own consent We will bring master Johnny with us ; you and he shall have the small 
pox here, and we will be as happy as Mr. Hancock and his lady. Thank Abby and John for their letters 
and kiss Charles and Tom for me. John writes like a hero, glowing with ardor for his country and burning with indignation against her enemies. 
</p><p>
As to coming home I have no thoughts of it ; shall 
stay here till the year is out, for what I know. Af 
fairs are in a critical state, and important steps are 
now taking every day, so that I could not reconcile it 
to my own mind to be absent from this place at 
present. Nothing is expected from the Commissioners, yet we are waiting for them in some respects. 
The lories and timids pretend to expect great things 
from them. But the generality expect nothing but 
more insults and affronts. Privateering is licensed, 
and the ports are wide open. As soon as the resolves 
are printed, which will be to-morrow, I will send them.

MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
I AM determined not to commit a fault, which escaped me the last time I set out for the southward. I waited on General Thomas at Roxbury, this morning, and 
then went to Cambridge, where I dined at Colonel Mifllin's with the General and lady, and a vast collection of other company, among whom were six or seven 
sachems and warriors of the French Caghnawaga Indians with several of their wives and children. A 
savage feast they made of it, yet were very polite in 
the Indian style. One of these sachems is an Englishman, a native of this colony, whose name was Williams, captivated in infancy with his mother, and 
adopted by some kind squaw ; another, I think, is half French blood. 
</p><p>
I was introduced to them by the General, as one of 
the grand council fire at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, which made 
them prick up their ears. They came and shook 
hands with me, and made me low bows and scrapes, 
&c. In short, I was much pleased with this day's entertainment. 
</p><p>
The General is to make them presents in clothes 
and trinkets. They have visited the lines at Cam 
bridge, and are going to see those at Roxbury. 
</p><p>
To-morrow we mount for the grand council fire, where I shall think often of my little brood at the 
foot of Pcnn's hill. Remember me particularly to each of the children. Tell them I charge them to be 
good, honest, active and industrious, for their own sakes as well as ours.

MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
HERE I am again. Arrived last Thursday, in good 
health, although I had a cold journey. The weather, 
a great part of the way, was very severe, which pre 
vented our making very quick progress. My companion was agreeable and made the journey much less tedious than it would have been.

I can form no judgment of the state of public opinions and principles here, as yet, nor any conjectures of what an hour may bring forth.

Have been to meeting, and heard Mr. Duffield from

when he led thee by the way ? " He prayed very earnestly for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, supposing the 
latter to be in danger of destruction. I, however, am not convinced that Vandcput will fire upon that town. 
It has too much Tory property to be destroyed by Tories. I hope it will be fortified and saved. If not, 
the question may be asked, " hast thou not procured this? "

To-morrow Doctor Smith is to deliver an oration in 
honor of the brave Montgomery. I will send it, as 
soon as it is out, to you. There is a deep anxiety, a 
kind of thoughtful melancholy, and in some, a lowness 
of spirits approaching to despondency, prevailing 
through the southern colonies, at present, very similar 
to what I have often observed in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, particularly 
on the first news of the port bill, and last year about . 
</p><p>
this time, or a little later, when the bad news arrived 
which dashed their fond hopes, with which they had 
deluded themselves through the winter. In this or a 
similar condition we shall remain, I think, until late in 
the spring, when some critical event will take place, 
perhaps sooner. But the arbiter of events, the sovereign of the world only knows, which way the torrent 
will be turned. Judging by experience, by probabilities and by all appearances, I conclude, it will roll on 
to dominion and glory, though the circumstances and 
consequences may be bloody. 
</p><p>
In such great changes and commotions, individuals 
are but atoms. It is scarcely worth while to consider 
what the consequences will be to us. What will be 
the effects upon present and future millions, and mil 
lions of millions, is a question very interesting to benevolence, natural and Christian. God grant they may, and I firmly believe they will, be happy.

LEE is at York, and we have requested a battalion of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> associators, together with a regiment of 
Jersey minute men, to march to his assistance. Lord Sterling was there before with his regiment, so that 
there will be nbout a thousand men with Lee from 
Connecticut, about six hundred with Lord Sterling 
from the Jerseys, one battalion of about seven hundred and twenty minute men from Jersey, and one of 
the same number from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. We shall soon 
have four battalions more, raised in Pennsylvania, to 
march to the same place, and one more in the Jerseys. Mr. Dickinson being the first Colonel and 
Commander of the first battalion too, churned it as his 
right to march upon this occasion. Mr. Heed, formerly <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a>'s Secretary, goes his lieu 
tenant colonel. Mr. Dickinson's alacrity and spirit 
upon this occasion, which certainly becomes his character, and sets a fine example, is much talked of and 
applauded. This afternoon, the four battalions of the militia were together, and Mr. Dickinson mounted the 
rostrum to harangue them, which he did with great vehemence and pathos, as it is reported. 
</p><p>
I suppose, if I could have made interest enough to 
have been chosen more^ than a lieutenant, I should 
march too, upon some such emergency ; and possibly 
a contingency may happen, when it will be proper 
for me to do it still, in rank and file. I will not fail to 
march, if it should. In the beginning of a war,, in 
colonies like this and Virginia, where the martial spirit 
is but just awakened, and the people are unaccustomed 
to arms, it may be proper and necessary for such 
popular orators as Henry and Dickinson to assume a 
military character* But I really think them both better statesmen than soldiers, though I cannot say they.. 
arc not very good in the latter character. Henry's principles and systems are much more conformable to mine than the other's, however. 
</p><p>
I feel, upon some of these occasions, a flow of spirits and an effort of imagination, very like an ambition to be engaged in the more active, gay, and dangerous scenes ; (dangerous, I say, but recall that word, 
for there is no course more dangerous than that which 
1 am in.) I have felt such passions all my lifetime, 
particularly in the year 1757, when I longed more 
ardently to be a soldier, than I ever did to be a lawyer. But I am too old, and too much worn with fatigues of study in my youth, and there is too little 
need, in my Province, of such assistance, for me to assume a uniform 
</p><p>
" Non tali auxilio, nee defensoribus ictis Tempo eget"

I believe I must write you soon Lord Sterling's character, because I was vastly pleased with him. 
For the future I shall draw no characters but such as I like. Pimps destroy all freedom of correspondence.

I SENT you from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> a pamphlet intituled 
" Common Sense," written in vindication of doctrines, which there is reason to expect, that the further encroachments of tyranny and depredations of oppression 
will soon make the common faith ; unless the cunning 
ministry, by proposing negotiations and terms of re 
conciliation, should divert the present current from its 
channel. 
</p><p>
Reconciliation if practicable, and peace if attainable, 
you very well know, would be as agreeable to my inclinations, and as advantageous to my interest, as to 
any man's. But see no prospect, no probability, no 
possibility. And I cannot but despise the understand 
ing, which sincerely expects an honorable peace, for 
its credulity, and detest the hypocritical heart, which 
pretends to expect it, when in truth it does not. The 
newspapers here are full of free speculations, the 
tendency of which you will easily discover. The 
writers reason from topics which have been long in 
contemplation and fully understood by the people at 
large in New England, but have been attended to in 
the southern colonies only by gentlemen of free spirits 
and liberal minds, who are very few. I shall endeavour to enclose to you as many of the papers and 
pamphlets as I can, as long as I stay here. Some will go by this conveyance. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="met colleague">Dr. Franklin</a>, Mr. Chase, and Mr. Charles Carroll of Carrollton in Maryland, are chosen a committee to go 
into Canada. The characters of the two first you 
know. The last is not a member of Congress, but a 
gentleman of independent fortune, perhaps the largest 
in America, a hundred and fifty or two hundred thou 
sand pounds sterling ; educated in some university in 
France, though a native of America, of great abilities 
and learning, complete master of the French language, and a professor of the Roman Catholic religion, yet a warm, a firm, a zealous supporter of the 
rights of America, in whose cause he has hazarded 
his all. Mr. John Carroll, of Maryland, a Roman 
Catholic priest and a Jesuit, is to go with the commit 
tee ; the priests in Canada having refused baptism and 
absolution to our friends there. General Lee is to 
command in that country, whose address, experience 
and abilities, added to his fluency in the French language, will give him great advantages. 
</p><p>
The events of war are uncertain. We cannot en 
sure success, but we can deserve it. I am happy in 
this provision for that important department, because 
I think it the best that could be made in our circumstances. Your prudence will direct you to communicate the circumstances of the priest, the Jesuit, and the 
Romish religion, only to such persons as can judge of 
the measure upon large and generous principles, and 
will not indiscreetly divulge it. The step was necessary, for the anathemas of the church are very terrible to our friends in Canada. 
</p><p>
I wish I understood French as well as you. I 
would have gone to Canada, if I had. I feel the want 
of education every day, particularly of that language. 
I pray, my dear, that you would not suffer your sons 
or your daughter ever to feel a similar pain. It is in 
your power to teach them French, and I, every day, 
see more and more, that it will become a necessary 
accomplishment of an American gentleman or lady. 
</p><p>
Pray write me in your next the name of the author of 
your thin French grammar, which gives you the pronunciation of the French words in English letters, that 
is, which shows you how the same sounds would be signified by English vowels and consonants. 
</p><p>
Write me as often as you can. Tell me all the news. Desire the children to write to me, and believe me to bo theirs and yours.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
OUR worthy friend, Frank Dana, arrived here last evening from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, to which place he came lately 
from England in the packet. In company with him 
is a gentleman by the name of Wrixon, who has been 
a field officer in the British army, served all the last 
war in Germany, and has seen service in every part 
of Europe. He left the army some time ago, and 
studied law in the temple, in which science he made 
a great proficiency. He wrote, lately, a pamphlet under the title of " the Rights of Britons," which he has 
brought over with him. He is a friend of liberty, and 
thinks justly of the American question. He has great 
abilities, as well as experience in the military science, 
and is an able engineer. I hope we shall employ 
him. 
The Baron de Woedtke we have made a Brigadier 
General, and ordered him to Canada. The testimonials in his favor I shall enclose to you. Mr. Dana's t 
account, with which Mr. Wrixon's agrees, ought to extinguish, in every mind, all hopes of reconciliation 
with Great Britain. This delusive hope has done us great injuries, and if ever we are ruined, will be the 
cause of our fall. A hankering after the leeks of Egypt makes us forget the cruelty of her task masters. 
</p><p>
I shall suffer many severe pains on your account 
for some days. By a vessel from Salem a cannonade was heard from dark till nine o clock, last night 
was a week ago. Your vicinity to such scenes of 
carnage and desolation as, I fear, are now to be seen 
in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> and its environs, will throw you into much 
distress, but I believe in my conscience, I feel more 
here than you do. The sound of cannon was not 
so terrible, when I was at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>, as it is here, 
though I hear it at four hundred miles distance. 
</p><p>
You can't imagine what a mortification I sustain in 
not having received a single line from you since we 
parted. I suspect some villany in conveyance. By the 
relation of Mr. Dana, Mr. Wrixon and Mr. Temple, 
Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Sewall and their associates are in 
great disgrace in England. Persons are ashamed to 
be seen to speak to them. They look despised and sunk. 
</p><p>
I shall enclose an extract of a letter from Mons. Dubourg in Paris, and a testimonial in favor of our Prussian General 
</p><p>
Adieu.

</p><p>
YESTERDAY I had the long expected and much wished 
pleasure of a letter from you, of various dates from 
the 2d to the 10th March. I This is the first line I have 
received since I left you. I wrote you from Water- 
town, I believe, relating my feast at the Quarter Master General's with the Caghnawaga Indians, and from 
Framingham, an account of the ordnance there, and 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> I sent you a pamphlet. Hope you received these. Since I arrived here, I have written to you as often as I could. 
</p><p>
I am much pleased with your caution in your letter, in avoiding names both of persons and places, or 
any other circumstances, which might designate to strangers the writer, or the person written to, or the 
persons mentioned. Characters and description will do as well. 
</p><p>
The lie which, you say, occasioned such disputes at 
the tavern, was curious enough. Who could make 
and spread it ? I am much obliged to an uncle for 
his friendship. My worthy fellow citizens may be 
easy about me. I never can forsake what I take to 
be their interests. My own have never been considered by me in competition with theirs. My ease, my domestic happiness, my rural pleasures, my little property, my personal liberty, my reputation, my life have 
little weight and ever had in my own estimation, in comparison of the great object . of my country. 
I can say of it with sincerity, as Horace says of virtue. To America only and her friends a friend." 
</p><p>
You ask what is thought of " Common Sense." I 
Sensible men think there are some whims, some 
sophisms, some artful addresses to superstitious notions, 
some keen attempts upon the passions, in this pamphlet But all agree there is a great deal of good 
sense delivered in clear, simple, concise and nervous 
style. His sentiments of the abilities of America,and 
of the difficulty of a reconciliation with Great Britain, 
are generally approved. But his notions and plans of 
continental government are not much applauded. In deed this writer I lias a better hand in pulling down 
than building. It has been very generally propagated 
through the continent that I wrote this pamphlet 
But although I could not have written anything in so 
manly and striking a style, I flatter myself I should 
have made a more respectable figure as an architect^ 
if I had undertaken such a work, j This writer seems 
to have very inadequate ideas of what is proper and 
necessary to be done, in order to form constitutions for single colonies, as well as a great model of union 
Your distresses, which you have painted in such 
lively colors, I feel in every line as I read. I dare not write all that I think upon this occasion. I wish 
our people had taken possession of Nook's hill at the 
same time when they got the other heights, and before the militia was dismissed. 
</p><p>
Poor cousin I pity him. How much soever he 
may lament certain letters, I 1 Don't lament. I never 
repent of what was no sin. Misfortunes may he borne 
without whining. But if I can believe Mr. Dana, those 
letters were much admired in England. I can't help 
laughing when I write it, because they were really 
such hasty crude scraps. If I could have foreseen 
their fate, they should have been fit to be seen, and 
worth all the noise they have made. Mr. Dana says 
they were considered in England as containing a comprehensive idea of what was necessary to be done, 
and as showing resolution enough to do it. Wretched stuff as they really were, according to him they have 
contributed somewhat towards making certain persons to be thought the greatest statesmen in the world. So much for vanity. 
</p><p>
My love, duty, respects and compliments wherever they belong. Virginia will be well defended. So 
will <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. So will South Carolina. America will, ere long, raise her voice aloud and assume a bolder air.

I GIVE you joy of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> and Charlestown, once more 
the habitation of Americans. I am waiting with great 
impatience for letters from you, which I know, will 
contain many particulars. We are taking precautions 
to defend every place that is in danger, the Carolinas, Virginia, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, Canada. I can think of 
nothing but fortifying <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> harbor. I want more cannon than are to be had. I want a fortification upon Point Alderton, one upon Lovell's Island, one 
upon George's Island, several upon Long Island, one upon the Moon, one upon Squantum. I want to 
hear of half a dozen fire ships, and two or three hundred fire rafts prepared. I want to hear of row-galleys, 
floating batteries built, and booms laid across the channel in the narrows, and Vaisseaux de Prise 
sunk in it I wish to hear that you are translating <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a> commons into the channel. No efforts, no 
expense are too extravagant for me to wish for, to fortify that harbor so as to make it impregnable. I hope every body will join and work until it is done. 
</p><p>
We have this week lost a very valuable friend of the colonies in Governor Ward, of Rhode Island, by 
the small pox in the natural way. He never would hearken to his friends, who have been constantly advising him to be inoculated, ever since the first Congress began. But he would not be persuaded. Numbers, who have been inoculated, have gone through 
this distemper without any danger, or even confinement, but nothing would do. He must take it in the 
natural way, and die. 5 He was an amiable and a sensible man, a steadfast friend to his country upon very 
pure principles. His funeral was attended with the same solemnities as Mr. Randolph's. Mr. Stillman 
being the Anabaptist minister here, of which persuasion was the Governor, was desired by Congress to 
preach a serrnon, which he did with great applause.

are opened wide enough at last, and privateers are 
allowed to prey upon British trade. This is not 
independency, you know. What is ? Why, government in every colony, a confederation among them 
all, and treaties with foreign nations to acknowledge 
us a sovereign state and all that When these things 
will be done, or any of them, time must discover. 
Perhaps the time is near, perhaps a great way off.

</p><p>
You justly complain of my short letters, but the critical state of things and the multiplicity of avocations 
must plead my excuse. You ask where the fleet is ? The enclosed papers will inform you. You ask, what 
sort of defence Virginia can make ?* I believe they will make an able defence. Their militia and minute 
.ve been some time employed in training themselves, and they have nine battalions of regulars, as 
they call them, maintained among them, under good officers, at the continental expense. They have set up a 
number of manufactories of fire-arms, which are busily employed. They are tolerably supplied with 
powder, and are successful and assiduous in making 
saltpetre. Their neighbouring sister, or rather daughter colony of North Carolina, which is a warlike 
colony, and has several battalions at the continental expense, as well as a pretty good militia, are ready to 
assist them, and they are in very good spirits and seem determined to make a brave resistance. The 
gentry are very rich, and the common people very 
poor. This inequality of property gives an aristocratical turn to all their proceedings, and occasions a 
strong aversion in their patricians, to Common 
Sense. I But the spirit of these Barons is coming 
down and it must submit. It is very true, as you observe, they have been duped by Dunmore. But 
this is a common case. All the colonies are duped, 
more or less, at one time and another. A more egregious bubble was never blown up, than the story of 
Commissioners coming to treat with the Congress, yet 
it has gained credit like a charm, not only with, but against, the clearest evidence. I never shall forget 
the delusion which seized 6ur best and most sagacious friends, the dear inhabitants of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, the winter be 
fore last. Credulity and the want of foresight are 
imperfections in the human character, that no politician can sufficiently guard against. 
</p><p>
You give me some pleasure by your account of a 
certain house in Queen street. I had burned it long 
ago in imagination. It rises now to my view like a phoenix. What shall I say of the Solicitor General ? 
I pity his pretty children. I pity his father and his 
sisters. I wish I could be clear that it is no moral 
evil to pity him and his lady. Upon repentance, they 
will certainly have a large share in the compassions of 
many. But let us take warning, and give it to our 
children. Whenever vanity and gaiety, a love of 
pomp and dress, furniture, equipage, buildings, great 
company, expensive diversions and elegant entertainments get the better of the principles and judgments 
of men or women, there is no knowing where they 
will stop, nor into what evils, natural, moral or political they will lead us. Your description o/ your own gaiete de cccur charms me. Thanks be to God, you 
have just cause to rejoice ; and may the bright prospect be obscured by no cloud. As to declarations of 
independency, be patient Read our privateering 
laws and our commercial laws. What signifies a word? 
</p><p>
As to your extraordinary code of laws, I cannot but laugh. We have been told that our struggle has loosened the bonds of government every where ; thai-children and apprentices were disobedient; that 
schools and colleges were grown turbulent ; that Indians slighted their guardians, and negroes grew inso 
lent to their masters. But your letter I was the first intimation that another tribe, more numerous and powerful than all the rest, were grown discontented. 
This is rather too coarse a compliment, but you are so 
saucy, I won t blot it out. Depend upon it, we know 
better than to repeal our masculine systems. Al 
though they are in full force, you know they are little more than theory. We dare not exert our power 
in its full latitude. We are obliged to go fair and 
softly, and, in practice, you know we are the subjects. 
We have only the name of masters, and rather than 
give up this, which would completely subject us to 
the despotism of the petticoat, I hope, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a>, and all our brave heroes would fight ; I am 
sure, every good politician would plot, as long as he 
would against despotism, empire, monarchy, aristocracy, oligarchy or ochlocracy. A fine story indeed ! 
I begin to think the ministry as deep as they are 
wicked. After stirring up tories, land-jobbers, trimmers, bigots, Canadians, Indians, Negroes, Hanoverians, Hessians, Russians, Irish Roman Catholics, 
Scotch renegadoes, at last, they have stimulated the to demand new privileges and threaten to rebel. 
</p><p>
be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors 
were. Do not put such an unlimited power into the hands of 
the husbands. Remember, all men would be tyrants, if they 
could. If particular care and attention are not paid to the 
ladies, WP are determined to foment a rebellion, and will not 
hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation."

I SEND you every newspaper that comes out, and I 
send you, now and then, a few sheets of paper, but 
this article is as scarce here, as with you. I would 
send a quire, if I could get a conveyance. 
</p><p>
I write you now and then a line, as often as I can, but I can tell you no news, but what I send in the public papers. 
</p><p>
We are waiting, it is said, for commissioners; a 
messiah that will never come. This story of commissioners is as arrant an illusion as ever was hatched 
in the brain of an enthusiast, a politician, or a maniac. 
I have laughed at it, scolded at it, grieved at it, and I 
don t know but I may, at an unguarded moment, have 
rip d at it But it is vain to reason against such delusions. I was very sorry to see, in a letter from the 
General, that he had been bubbled with it ; and still 
more, to see, in a letter from my sagacious friend, 
W. at Plymouth, that he was taken in too. 
</p><p>
My opinion is, that the commissioners and the com 
mission have been here, (I mean in America,) these 
two months. The Governors, Mandamus Councillors, Collectors and Comptrollers and Commanders of 
the army and navy, I conjecture, compose the list, 
and their power is to receive submissions. But We are 
not in a very submissive mood. They will get no ad- 
vantage of us. We shall go on to perfection, I believe. I have been very busy for some time ; have 
written about ten sheets of paper, with my own hand, 
about some trifling affairs, I which I may mention some time or other not now, for fear of accidents. 
</p><p>
What will come of this labor, time will discover. I shall get nothing by it, I believe, because I never 
get anything by anything that I do. I am sure the 
public or posterity ought to get something. I believe 
my children will think I might as well have thought 
and labored a little, night and day, for their benefit. 
Hut I will not bear the reproaches of my children. I 
will tell them, that I studied and labored to procure a 
free constitution of government for them to solace 
themselves under, and if they do not prefer this to ample fortune, to case and elegance, they are not my 
--children, and I care not what becomes of them. They shall live upon thin diet, wear mean clothes, and work 
hard with cheerful hearts and free spirits, or they may be the children of the earth, or of no one, for me. 
</p><p>
John has genius and so has Charles. Take care that they Don't go astray. Cultivate their minds, in 
spire their little hearts, raise their wishes. Fix their attention upon great and glorious objects. Root out 
every little thing. Weed out every meanness. Make them great and manly. Teach them to acorn injustice, ingratitude, cowardice and falsehood. Let them revere nothing hut religion, morality and liberty. 
</p><p>
Abby and Tommy are not forgotten by me although I did not mention them before. The first, by 
reason of her sex, requires a different education from the two I have mentioned. Of this, you are the only judge. I want to send each of my little pretty flock 
some present or other. I have walked over this city twenty times, and gaped at every shop, like a countryman, to find something, but could not. Ask every 
one of them what they would choose to have, and write it to me in your next letter. From this I shall judge of their taste and fancy and discretion.

George's society. Upon the twenty-third of April, annually, they had a great feast. But the Tories and politics have made a schism in the society, so that one 
part of them are to meet and dine at the City Tavern, and the other nt the Bunch of Grapes Israel Jacobs's, and a third party go out of town. One set are 
stanch Americans, another stanch Britons, and a third, halfway men, neutral beings, moderate men, 
prudent, folks, for such is the division among men upon all occasions and every question. This is the account 
which I have from my barber, who is one of the society, and zealous on the side of America, and one of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> Associators. 
</p><p>
This curious character of a barber, I have a great inclination to draw, for your amusement. He is a little dapper fellow, short and small, but active and 
lively. A tongue as fluent and voluble as you please, wit at will, and a memory or an invention which never 
leaves him at a loss for a story to tell you for your entertainment. IT has seen great company. He has dressed hair and shaved faces at Bath, and at 
Court. He is acquainted with several of the nobility and gentry, particularly Sir William Meredith. He 
married a girl, the daughter of a Quaker in this place, of whom he tells many droll stories. He is a serjeant in one of the companies of some battalion or other 
here. He frequents, of evenings, a beer house kept by one Weaver in the city, where he has many curious disputes and adventures, and meets many odd characters. 
</p><p>
I believe you will think me very idle to write you so trifling a letter, upon so uninteresting a subject, at a time when my country is fighting pro aris et focis. 
But I assure you I am glad to chat with this barber, while he is shaving and combing me, to divert myself from less agreeable thoughts. He is so sprightly and good humoured, that he contributes, more than I could have imagined, to my comfort in this life. Burne has prepared a string of toasts for the club to drink to-day at Israel's.

MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
OUR amiable friend Hancock, who, by the way, is our President, is to send his servant tomorrow for Cambridge. I am to send a few lines by him. If his man should come to you, to deliver this letter, treat him very kindly, because he is a kind, humane, clever fellow. 
</p><p>
We are distressed here for want of intelligence 
and information from you and from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, Cambridge, &c. &c. &c. We have no regular advices. 
I received one kind letter from you in one from Colonel Warren. An excellent letter I had from 
him. It has done him great honor and me much good. My duty and love to all. I have had miserable health and blind eyes, almost ever since I left 
you ; but I found Dr. Young here, who, after scolding at me quantum sufficit, for not taking his advice, has pill d and electuary d me into pretty good order. My eyes are better, my head is better, so are my spirits. 
</p><p>
The Congress will support the Massachusetts. There is a good spirit here. But we have an amazing field of business before us. When I shall have 
the joy of meeting you and our little ones, I know not. The military spirit, which runs through the continent, 
is truly amazing. This city turns out two thousand men every day. Mr. Dickinson is a Colonel, Mr. Reed a Lieutenant-Colonel, Mr. Mifflin a Major. 
He ought to have been a General, for he has been the animating soul of the whole. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">Colonel Washington</a> appears at Congress, in his uniform, and, by his great experience and abilities in military matters, is of much service to us. 
</p><p>
Oh that I were a soldier ! I will be. I am reading military books. Every body must, and will, and shall be a soldier.

</p><p>
YESTERDAY I received two letters from you from the 7th to the 14th of April. It gives me concern to think of the many cares you must have upon your 
mind. Your reputation as a farmer or anything else you undertake, I dare answer for. Your partner's character as a statesman is much more problematical. 
</p><p>
As to my return, I have not a thought of it Journeys of such a length are tedious, and expensive both of time and money, neither of which is my own. I 
hope to spend the next Christmas where I did the last, and after that, I hope to be relieved ; for by that time, I shall have taken a pretty good trick at helm, whether the vessel has been well steered or not. But if my countrymen should insist upon my serving them an 
other year, they must let me bring my whole family 
with me. Indeed, I could keep house here with my partner, four children and two servants as cheap as I maintain myself here with two horses and a servant at lodgings. 
</p><p>
Instead of domestic felicity, I am destined to public contentions. Instead of rural felicity, I must reconcile myself to the smoke and noise of a city. In the place of private peace, I must be distracted with the 
vexation of developing the deep intrigues of politicians, and must assist in conducting the arduous operations of war, and think myself well rewarded if my private pleasure and interests are sacrificed, as they 
ever have been and will be, to the happiness others. 
</p><p>
You tell me, our Jurors refuse to serve, because the 
writs are issued in the King's name. I am very glad 
to hear that they discover so much sense and spin 
I learn, from another letter, that the general court have 
left out of their bills the year of his reign, and that 
they are making a law, that the same name shall be 
left out of all writs, commissions, and all law processes. This is good news too. The same will be the case in all the colonies, very soon. 
</p><p>
You ask me, how I have done the winter past ? I have not enjoyed so good health as last fall But I 
have done complaining of anything. Of ill health, I have no right to complain, because it is given me by 
Heaven. Of meanness, of envy, of littleness, of , 
of , of , I have reason and right to complain, but 
I have too much contempt to use that right. There 
is such a mixture of folly, littleness and knavery in 
this world, that I am weary of it, and although I behold it with unutterable contempt and indignation, yet 
the public good requires that I should take no notice of it by word or by letter. And to this public good I will conform. 
</p><p>
You will see an account of the fleet in some of the 
papers I have sent you. I give you joy of the Admiral's success. I have vanity enough to take to my 
self a share in the merit of the American navy. It was always a measure that my heart was much en 
gaged in, and I pursued it for a long time against the wind and tide, but at last obtained it 
</p><p>
Is there no way for two friendly souls to converse 
together although the bodies are four hundred miles 
off? Yes, by letter. But I want a better communication. I want to hear you think or to see your 
thoughts. The conclusion of your letter makes my heart throb, more than a cannonade would. You bid 
me burn your letters. But I must forget you first In yours of April 14 you say, you miss our friend in 
the conveyance of your letters. Don't hesitate to write by the post Seal well. Don't miss a single post You take it for granted that I have particular 
</p><p>
intelligence of everything from others, but I have not. 
If any one wants a vote for a commission he vouch 
safes me a letter, but tells me very little news. I 
have more particulars from you, than any one else. 
Pray keep me constantly informed what ships are in 
the harbor and whaK fortifications are going on. I 
am quite impatient to near of more vigorous measures 
for fortifying <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> harbor. Not a moment should be 
neglected. Every man ought to go down, as they did 
after the battle of Lexington, and work until it is done. 
I would willingly pay half a dozen hands myself, and 
subsist them, rather than it should not be done immediately. It is of more importance than to raise corn. 
You say enclosed is a prologue and a parody, but neither was enclosed. If you did not forget it, the letter 
has been opened and the enclosures taken out. If the 
small pox spreads, run me in debt. I received, a post or two past, a letter from your uncle at Salem, 
containing a most friendly and obliging invitation to you and yours, to go and have the distemper at his 
house, if it should spread. He has one or two in his family to have it. 
is the same person. His name is Paine, a gentleman about two years ago from England, a man who, General Lee says, has genius in his eyes. The writer of 
" Cassandra " is said to be Mr. James Cannon, a tutor in 
the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> college. " Cato " is reported here to be 
Doctor Smith a match for Brattle. The oration 
was an insolent performance, v A motion was made to 
thank the Orator, and ask a copy, but opposed with 
great spirit and vivacity from every part of the room, 
and at last withdrawn, lest it should be rejected, as it 
certainly would have been, with indignation. The 
Orator then printed it himself, after leaving out or altering some offensive passages. This is one of the 
many irregular and extravagant characters of the age: 
I never heard one single person speak well of any 
thing about him, but his abilities, which are generally 
allowed to be good. The appointment of him to 
make the oration was a great oversight and mistake. 
The last act of Parliament has made so deep an 
impression upon people's minds, throughout the colonies, it is looked upon as the last stretch of oppression, 
that we are hastening rapidly to great events. Governments will be up, everywhere, before midsummer 
and an end to royal style, titles and authority. Such 
mighty revolutions make a deep impression on the 
minds of men, and set many violent passions at work. 
Hope, fear, joy, sorrow, love, hatred, malice, envy, 
revenge, jealousy, ambition, avarice, resentment, gratitude, and every other passion, feeling, sentiment, principle and imagination were never in more lively exercise than they are now from Florida to Canada inclusively. May God in his- providence overrule the 
whole for the good of mankind. It requires more 
serenity of temper, a deeper understanding and more 
courage than fell to the lot of Marlborough to ride i this whirlwind.

YOURS of 21 April came to hand yesterday. I send 
you regularly every newspaper, and write as often as 
I can ; but I feel more skittish about writing than I 
did, because, since the removal of head-quarters to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, we have no express, and very few individual travellers ; and the post I am not quite confident in ; however, I shall write as I can. 
</p><p>
What shall I do with my office ? I want to resign it for a thousand reasons. Would you advise me ? 
</p><p>
There has been a gallant battle in Delaware river 
between the galleys and two men of war, the 
Roebuck and Liverpool, in which the men of war 
came off second best ; which has diminished, in the 
minds of the people on both sides of the river, the terror of a man of war. 
</p><p>
I long to hear a little of my private affairs ; yet I 
dread it too, because I know you must be perplexed 
and distressed. I wish it was in my power to relieve 
you. It gives me great pleasure to learn, that our 
rulers are, at last, doing something towards the fortification of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. But I am inexpressibly chagrined 
to find that the enemy is fortifying on George's Island. 
I never shall be easy, until they are completely driven 
out of that harbor, and effectually prevented from ever 
getting in again. As you are a politician and now 
elected into an important office, that of judgess of the 
Tory ladies, which will give you, naturally, an influence with your sex, I hope you will be instant, in sea 
son and out of season, in exhorting them to use 
their influence with the gentlemen, to fortify upon 
George's Island, LovelFs, Pettick's, Long, or wherever 
else it is proper. Send down fire ships and rafts, and 
burn to ashes those pirates. I am out of patience with 
the languid, lethargic councils of the province, at such 
a critical, important moment, puzzling their heads 
about twopenny fees, and confession bills, and what 
not, when the harbor of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> is defenceless. If I 
was there, I should storm and thunder like Demosthenes, or scold like a tooth-drawer. Do ask Mr. Wibird and Mr. Weld and Mr. Taft to preach about 
it. I am ashamed, vexed, angry to the last degree. 
Our people, by their turpitude, have invited the enemy to come to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> again, and I fear they will have 
the civility and politeness to accept the invitation. 
</p><p>
Your uncle has never answered my letter. Thank 
the Doctor, he has written me a most charming letter, 
full of intelligence, and very sensible and useful re 
marks. I will pay the debt, as far as my circumstances will admit, and as soon. But I hope my friends 
will not wait for regular returns from me. I have not 
yet left off pitying " the fifty or sixty men ; " and if 
my friends knew all that I do, they would pity too.

Betsey Smith, lazy hussy, has not written me a line a great while. I wish she was married ; then 
she would have some excuse. Duty to papa. Love to all. How is the family over against the church ?

I HAVE this morning heard Mr. Duffield, upon the signs 
of the times. He ran a parallel between the case of 
Israel, and that of America ; and between the con 
duct of Pharaoh, and that of George. Jealousy that 
the Israelites would throw off the government of 
Egypt made him issue his edict, that the midwives 
should cast the children into the river, and the other 
edict, that the men should make a large revenue of 
bricks without straw. He concluded, that the course 
of events indicated strongly the design of Providence, -* 
that we should be separated from Great Britain, &c. 
Is it not a saying of Moses, " who am I, that I 
should go in and out before this great people ? " 
When I consider the great events which are passed, 
and those greater which ore rapidly advancing, and 
that I may have been instrumental in touching some 
springs, and turning some small wheels, which have 
had and will have such effects, I feel an awe upon my 
mind, which is not easily described. Great Britain 
has at last driven America to the last step, a complete separation from her; a total absolute independence, not only of her Parliament, but of her crown, 
for such is the amount of the resolve of the 15th. Confederation among ourselves, or alliances with foreign 
nations are not necessary to a perfect separation from 
Britain. That is effected by extinguishing all authority under the crown, Parliament, and nation, as the 
resolution for instituting governments has done, to all 
intents and purposes. Confederation will be necessary 
for our internal concord, and alliances may be so for your external defence. 
</p><p>
I have reasons to believe that no colony, which shall assume a government under the people, will give it 
up. There is something very unnatural and odious in a government a thousand leagues off. A whole government of our own choice, managed by persons whom 
we love, revere, and can confide in, has charms in it, for which men will fight Two young gentlemen 
from South Carolina in this city, who were in Charlestown when their new constitution was promulgated, 
and when their new Governor and Council and Assembly walked out in procession, attended by the guards, 
company of cadets, light horse, &c., told me, that they were beheld by the people with transports and 
tears of joy. The people gazed at them with a kind of rapture. They both told me, that the reflection, 
that these were gentlemen whom they all loved, esteemed and revered, gentlemen of their own choice, 
whom they could trust, and whom they could displace, if any of them should behave amiss, affected them 
so, that they could not help crying... They say, their people will never give up this government. One of 
these gentlemen is a relation of yours, a Mr. Smith, son of Mr. Thomas Smith. I shall give him this letter or another to you. 
</p><p>
A privateer fitted out here by Colonel Roberdeau and Major Bayard since our resolves for privateering, 
I am this moment informed, has taken a valuable prize. This is encouragement at the beginning. 
</p><p>
In one or two of your letters, you remind me to think of you as I ought. Bo assured, there is not an 
hour of the day, in which I Don't think of you as I ought, that is, with every sentiment of tenderness, esteem and admiration.

WHEN a man is seated in the midst of forty people, some of whom are talking, and others whispering, it is 
not easy to think what is proper to write. I shall send you the newspapers, which will inform you of 
public affairs, and the particular flickerings of parties in this colony. I am happy to learn from your letter, that a flame is at last raised among the people, 
for the fortification of the harbor. Whether Nantasket or Point Alderton would be proper posts to be 
taken, I can't say. But I would fortify every place which is proper, and which cannon could be obtained 
for. Generals Gates and Mifflin are now here: <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a> will be here to-morrow, when we shall consult and deliberate concerning the operations of the ensuing campaign. 
</p><p>
We have dismal accounts from Europe of the preparations against us. This summer will be very important to us. We shall have a severe trial of our 
patience, fortitude and perseverance. But I hope we shall do valiantly, and tread down our enemies. 
</p><p>
I have some thoughts of petitioning the General Court for leave to bring my family here. I am a 
lonely, forlorn creature here. It used to be some comfort to me, that I had a servant and some horses. 
They composed a sort of family for me. But now, there is not one creature here, that I seem to have 
any kind of relation to. It is a cruel reflection, which very often comes across me, that I should be separated 
so far from those babes, whose education and welfare lie so near my heart. But greater misfortunes than these must not divert us from superior duties. 
</p><p>
Your sentiments of the duties we owe to our country are such as become the best of women and the best of men. Among all the disappointments and 
perplexities which have fallen to my share in life, nothing has contributed so much to support my mind, 
as the choice blessing of a wife, whose capacity enabled her to comprehend, and whose pure virtue 
obliged her to approve the views of her husband. This has been the cheering consolation of my heart 
in my most solitary, gloomy and disconsolate hours. In this remote situation, I am deprived in a 
great measure of this comfort. Yet I read and read again your charming letters, and they serve me, in 
some faint degree, as a substitute for the company and conversation of the writer. I want to take a walk 
with you in the garden, to go over to the common, the plain, the meadow. I want to take Charles in one 
hand and Tom in the other, and walk with you, Abby on your right hand, and John upon my left, to view the corn fields, the orchards, &c. 
</p><p>
Alas, poor imagination ! how faintly an&lt;J imperfectly do you supply the want of originality and reality. But instead of those pleasing scenes of domestic life, I hope you will not be disturbed with the alarms of war. I hope, yet I fear.

I HAVE three I of your favors before me. One of 
May 7, another of May 9, and a third of May 14th. 
The last has given me relief from many anxieties. It 
relates wholly to private affairs, and contains such an 
account of wise and prudent management, as makes 
me very happy. I begin to be jealous, that our neighbors will think affairs more discreetly conducted in my 
absence, than at any other time. Whether your suspicions concerning a letter under a marble cover are 
just or not, it is best to say little about it It is a 
hasty,* hurried thing, and of no great consequence, 
calculated for a meridian at a great distance from 
New England. If it has done no good, it will do 
no harm. It has contributed to set people thinking 
upon the subject, and in this respect has answered its 
end. The manufacture of governments having, since 
the publication of that letter, been as much talked of, 
as that of saltpetre was before. 
</p><p>
I rejoice at your account of the spirit of fortification, and the good effects of it I hope, by this time, 
you are in a tolerable posture of defence. The in 
habitants of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> have done themselves great honor 
by their laudable zeal, the clergymen, especially. 
</p><p>
I think you shine as a stateswoman of late, as well as 
a farmeress. Pray where do you get your maxims of 
state ? They are very apropos. I am much obliged 
to Judge Gushing and his lady for their polite visit to 
you. I should be very happy to see him, and con 
verse with him about many things, but cannot hope 
for that pleasure very soon. The afiairs of America 
are in so critical a state, such great events are struggling into birth that I must not quit this station at this 
time. Yet I dread the melting heats of a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> summer, and know not how my frail constitution 
will endure it. Such constant care, such incessant application of mind, drinking up and exhausting the 
finer spirits, upon which life and health so essentially depend, will wear away a stronger man than I am. 
Yet I will not shrink from this danger or this toil. While my health shall be such, that I can discharge, 
-in any tolerable manner, the duties of this important post, I will not desert it. 
</p><p>
I am pleased to hear that the superior court is to sit at Ipswich in June. This will contribute to give 
stability to the government, I hopc^ift all its branches. 
But I presume other steps will be taken for this purpose. A Governor, and Lieutenant Governor, I hope, 
will be chosen, and the Constitution a little more fixed. I hope too, that the council will, this year, be more 
full, and augmented by the addition of good men. I hope Mr. Bowdoin will be Governor, if his health will 
permit, and Doctor Winthrop, Lieutenant Governor. These are wise, learned and prudent men. The first 
has a great fortune and wealthy connexions. The other has the advantage of a name and family which 
is much reverenced, besides his personal abilities and virtues, which are very great. ; 
</p><p>
Our friend, I I sincerely hope, will not refuse his appointment. For although I have ever thought that 
bench should be filled from the bar, and once labored successfully to effect it, yet as the gentlemen have seen 
fit to decline, I know of no one who would do more honor to the station, than my friend. None 
would be so agreeable to me, whether I am to sit by him or before him. I suppose it must be disagreeable 
to him and his lady, because he loves to be upon his farm, and they both love to be together. But you 
must tell them of a couple of their friends, who are as fond of living together, who are obliged to sacrifice 
their rural amusements and domestic happiness to the requisitions of the public. 
</p><p>
The Generals, Washington, Gates and Mifllin are all here, and we shall derive spirit, unanimity and vigor 
from their presence and advice. I hope you will have some general officers at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> soon. I am, with constant wishes and prayers for your health and prosperity, forever yours.

YESTERDAY I dined with Captain Richards, the gentle 
man who made me the present of the brass pistols. 
We had cherries, strawberries and green peas in plenty. 
The fruits are three weeks earlier here, than with 
you. Indeed, they are a fortnight earlier on the east, 
than on the west side of Delaware river. We have hadgreen peas this week past, but they were brought 
over the river, from New Jersey, to this market. 
There are none grown in the city, or on the west side 
of the river yet. The reason is, the soil of New Jersey is a warm sand ; that of Pennsylvania a cold clay. 
So much for peas and berries. 
</p><p>
Now for something of more importance. In all the 
correspondence I have maintained, during a course 
of twenty years, at least, that I have been a writer of 
letters, I never kept a single copy. This negligence 
and inaccuracy has been a great misfortune to me on 
many occasions. I have now purchased a folio book, 
in the first page of which, excepting one blank leaf, I 
am writing this letter, and intend to write all my letters to you in it, from this time forward. This will 
be an advantage to me in several respects. In the 
first place, I shall write more deliberately. In the 
second place, I shall be able, v at all times, to review 
what I have written. Third, I shall know how often 
I write. Fourth, I shall discover by this means, whether 
any of toy letters to you miscarry. If it were possible for me to find a conveyance, I would send you 
such another blank book as a present, that you might begin the practice at the same time, for I really think 
that your letters are much better worth preserving than mine. Your daughter and sons will very soon 
write so good hands, that they will copy the letters for you from your book, which will improve them, at the same time that it relieves you.

good a man ambitious ? Is it not a sin lo be so modest? Ask him how he can answer it? Thanks for 
your quotation from Sully. It is extremely apropos. 
I am very glad you are so well provided with help. 
Give my respects to Mr. Belcher and his family. Tell 
him I am obliged to him for his kind care of the farm. 
I wish I could go out with him, and see the business go 
on, but I can t. Thank your father and my mother 
for their kind remembrance of me. Return my duty 
to both. Charles's young heroism charms me. Kiss 
him. Poor Mugford, I yet glorious Mugford ! How 
beautiful and sublime it is to die for one's country ! What a fragrant memory remains ! 
</p><p>
The rumor you heard of General Gates will prove 
premature. I endeavoured both here and with the 
General to have it so," and should have succeeded, if 
it had not been for the loss of General Thomas. Cruel 
small pox ! worse than the sword ! But now, I fear we must part with Gates for the &gt;.ike of Canada. Mrs. Montgomery is a lady, like all the family, of refined 
sentiments and elegant accomplishments. Her letter, as you quote it, is very pathetic. I rejoice to hear that the enemy have not fortified ; and hope they will not be suffered to attempt it. 
</p><p>
Don t think about my clothes. I do well enough in that respect. As to your house at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, do with 
it as you please. Sell it, if you will, hut not for a farthing less than it cost me. Let it, if you please, 
but take care who your tenant is, both of his prudence to preserve the house, and his ability to pay the 
rent, I send you all the news in the papers. Great things are on the tapis. These throes will usher in the 
birth of a fine boy. We have no thoughts of removing from hence. There is no occasion for it.

</p><p>
I HAVE written so seldom to you, that I am really grieved at the recollection. I wrote you a few lines June 2, and a few more June 16. These are all 
that I have written to you, since this month began. It has been the busiest month that ever I saw. I 
have found time to enclose all the newspapers, which I hope you will receive in due time. 
</p><p>
Our misfortunes in Canada are enough to melt a 
heart of stone. The small pox is ten times more 
terrible than Britons, Canadians and Indians, together. 
This was the cause of our precipitate retreat from 
Quebec. This the cause of our disgraces at the 
Cedars. I Don't mean that this was all. There has 
been want approaching to famine, as well as pestilence And these discouragements have so disheartened our officers, that none of them seem to act with 
prudence and firmness. But these reverses of for 
tune Don't discourage me. It was natural to expect 
them, and we ought to be prepared in our minds 
for greater changes, and more melancholy scenes 
still. It is an animating cause, and brave spirits are 
not subdued with difficulties. 
</p><p>
Amidst all our gloomy prospects in Canada, we 
receive some pleasure from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. I congratulate 
you on your victory over your enemies in the harbor. This has long lain near my heart, and it gives 
me great pleasure to think that what was so much 
wished is accomplished. I hope our people will now 
make the lower harbor impregnable, and never 
again suffer the flag of a tyrant to fly within any 
part of it. 
</p><p>
The Congress have been pleased to give me more 
business than I am qualified for, and more than, I 
fear, I can go through with safety to my health. 
They have established a board of war and ordnance, 
and made me President of it, I an honor to which I 
never aspired, a trust to which I feel myself vastly 
unequal. But I am determined to do as well as I can, 
and make industry supply, in some degree, the place 
of abilities and experience. The Board sits every 
morning and every evening. This with constant 
attendance in Congress will so entirely engross my 
time, that I fear, I shall not be able to write you so 
often as I have. But I will steal time to write to 
you. 
</p><p>
The small pox ! the small pox ! what shall we do with it ? I could almost wish that an inoculating Hospital was opened in every town in New England, 
It is some small consolation that the scoundrel savages have taken a large dose of it. They plundered the 
baggage and stripped off the clothes of our men who had the small pox out full upon them at the Cedars.

YOUR favor I of 17 June, dated at Plymouth, was 
handed me by yesterday's post. I was much pleased 
to find that you had taken a journey to Plymouth, to see your friends, in the long absence of one, whom you may wish to see. The excursion will be an amusement, and will serve your health. How happy would it have made me to have taken this journey with you ! 
</p><p>
I was informed, a day or two before the receipt of 
your letter, that you was gone to Plymouth, by Mrs. 
Polly Palmer, who was obliging enough, in your absence, to send me the particulars of the expedition 
to the lower harbor against the men of war. Her narration is executed with a precision and perspicuity, 
which would have become the pen of an accomplished historian. 
</p><p>
I am very glad you had so good an opportunity of seeing one of our little American men of war. 
Many ideas new to you must have presented them selves in such a scene ; and you will in future better I understand the relations of sea engagements. 
</p><p>
I rejoice extremely at Dr. Bulfincirs petition to 
open a Hospital. But I hope the business will be done upon a larger scale. I hope that one Hospital 
will be licensed in every county, if not in every town. 
I am happy to find you resolved to be with the children in the first class. Mr. Whitney and Mrs. Katy 
Quincy are cleverly through inoculation in this city. 
The information you give me, of our friend's re 
fusing his appointment, has given me much pain, grief 
and anxiety. I believe I shall be obliged to follow 
his example. I have not fortune enough to support 
my family, and, what is of more importance, to sup 
port the dignity of that exalted station. It is too high 
and lifted up for me, who delight in nothing so much as retreat, solitude, silence and obscurity. In private life, no one has a right to censure me for following 
my own inclinations in retirement, simplicity and frugality. In public life, every man has a right to re 
mark as he pleases. At least he thinks so. Yesterday, the greatest question was decided, which 
ever was debated in America, and a greater, perhaps, 
never was nor will be decided among men. A Resolution was passed without one dissenting Colony 
" that these United Colonies are, and of right ought 
to be, free and independent States, and as such they 
have, and of right ought to have, full power to make 
war, conclude peace, establish commerce and to do 
all other acts and things which other States may right 
fully do." You will see, in a few days, a Declaration setting forth the causes which have impelled us 
to this mighty revolution, and the reasons which will 
justify it in the sight of God and man. A plan of confederation will be taken up in a few days. 
</p><p>
When I look back to the year <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1761">1761</a> and recollect 
the argument concerning writs of assistance in the 
superior court, which I have hitherto considered as 
the commencement of this controversy between Great 
Britain and America, and run through the whole 
period, from that time to this, and recollect the series 
of political events, the chain of causes and effects, I 
am surprised at the suddenness, as well as greatness 
of this revolution. Britain has been filled with folly, 
and America with wisdom; at least, this is my judgment. Time must determine. It is the will of Heaven that the two countries should be sundered forever. 
It may be the will of Heaven that America shall suffer calamities still more wasting, arid distresses yet 
more dreadful. If this is to be the case, it will have 
this good effect at least. It will inspire us with many 
virtues, which we have not, and correct many errors, 
follies and vices which threaten to disturb, dishonor, 
and destroy us. The furnace of affliction produces 
refinement in states as well as individuals. And the 
new Governments we are assuming in every part 
will require a purification from our vices, and an 
augmentation of our virtues, or they will be no blessings. The people ^ilLJwwe unbounded power, and 
the pe^pTe r ~5Te""extrernely addicted to corruption and venality, as well as the great. But I must submit 
all my hopes and fears to an overruling providence, in which, unfashionable as the faith may be, I firmly believe.

HAD a Declaration of Independency been made 
seven months ago, it would have been attended with 
many great and glorious effects. We might, before 
this hour, have formed alliances with foreign states. 
AVe should have mastered Quebec, and been in 
possession of Canada. You will perhaps wonder 
how such a declaration would have influenced our 
affairs in Canada, but if I could write with freedom, 
I could easily convince you that it would, and explain 
to you the manner how. Many gentlemen in high 
stations and of great influence, have been duped 
by the ministerial bubble of Commissioners to treat. 
And in real, sincere expectation of this event, which 
they so fondly wished, they have been slow and 
languid in promoting measures for the reduction of 
that province. Others there are in the Colonies who 
really wished that our enterprise in Canada would be 
defeated, that the Colonies might be brought into danger and distress between two fires, and be thus induced to submit. Others really wished to defeat the 
expedition to Canada, lest the conquest of it should 
elevate the minds of the people too much to hearken 
to those terms of reconciliation, which, they believed, 
would be offered us. These jarring views, wishes 
</p><p>
and designs occasioned an opposition to many salutary 
measures, which were proposed for the support of 
that expedition, and caused obstructions, embarrassments, and studied delays, which have finally lost us the province. 
</p><p>
All these causes however in conjunction would 
not have disappointed us, if it had not been for a 
misfortune which could not be foreseen, and perhaps, 
could not have been prevented I mean the prevalence of the small pox among our troops. This 
fatal pestilence completed our destruction. It is a 
frown of providence upon us, which we ought to lay 
to heart. 
</p><p>
But, on the other hand, the delay of this Declaration to this time has many threat advantages attending 
it. The hopes of reconciliation, which were fondly 
entertained by multitudes of honest and well mean 
ing, though weak and mistaken people, have been 
gradually and, at last, totally extinguished. Time 
has been given for the whole people maturely to consider the great question of independence, and to ripen 
their judgment, dissipate their fears, and allure their 
hopes, by discussing it in newspapers and pamphlets, 
by debating it in assemblies, conventions, committees 
of safety and inspection, in town and county meetings, 
as well as in private conversations, so that the whole 
people, in every colony of the thirteen, have now 
adopted it as their own act. This will cement the 
union, and avoid those heats, and perhaps convulsions, 
which might have been occasioned by such a Declaration, six months ago. 
</p><p>
But the day is past The second I day of July, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>, will be the most memorable epocha in the 
history of America. I am apt to believe that it will 
be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great 
anniversary Festival. It ought to be commemorated, 
as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized 
with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, 
guns, bells, bonfires and illuminations, from one end of this continent to the other, from this time forward, forever more. 
</p><p>
You will think me transported with enthusiasm, but I am not I am well aware of the toil, and blood, 
and treasure, that it will cost us to maintain this Declaration, and support and defend these States. 
Yet, through all t^e gloom, I can see the rays of ravishing light and $lory. I can sec that the end is 
more than worth all the means. And that posterity will triumph in that day's transaction, even although 
we should rue it, which I trust in God we shall not.

</p><p>
I HAVE, this moment, folded up a magazine and an 
Evening Post, and sent them off by an express, who 
could not wait for me to write a single line. It always 
goes to my heart, to send off a packet of pamphlets 
and newspapers, without a letter, but it sometimes 
unavoidably happens, and I suppose you had rather 
receive a pamphlet or newspaper, than nothing. 
</p><p>
The design of our enemy now seems to be, a powerful invasion of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and New Jersey. The 
Halifax fleet and army is arrived, and another fleet and army under Lord Howe is expected to join them. 
We are making great preparations to meet them, by marching the militia of Maryland, Pennsylvania and 
New Jersey down to the scene of action, and have made large requisitions upon New England. I hope, 
for the honor of New England, and the salvation of America, our people will not be backward in marching to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. We must maintain and defend 
that important post, at all events. If the enemy get 
possession there, it will cost New England very dear. 
There is no danger of the small pox at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. 
It is carefully kept out of the city and the army. I 
hope that your brother and mine too will go into the 
service of their country at this critical period of its distress. 
</p><p>
Our army at Crown Point is an object of wretchedness enough to fill a humane mind with horror ; disgraced, defeated, discontented, dispirited, diseased, 
naked, undisciplined, eaten up with vermin, no clothes, 
beds, blankets, no medicines, no victuals, but salt pork 
and flour. A chaplain from that army preached a 
sermon here the other day from " Cursed is he, that doeth the work of the Lord, deceitfully." I knew, 
better than he did, who the persons were, who de 
served these curses. But I could not help myself, nor 
my poor country, any more than he. I hope that measures will be taken to cleanse the army at Crown 
Point from the small pox, and that other measures 
will be taken in New England, by tolerating and encouraging inoculation, to render that distemper less Terrible. 
</p><p>
I am solicitous to hear what figure our new superior court made in their eastern circuit. What business they did ? whether the grand juries and petit juries 
were sworn ? whether they tried any criminals, or any civil actions? how the people were affected at 
the appearance of Courts again ? how the judges were treated ? whether with respect or cold neglect, 
&c. Every colony upon the continent will soon he in the same situation. They are erecting governments as fast as children build cob-houses ; but, I 
conjecture, they will hardly throw them down again so soon. 
</p><p>
The practice we have hitherto been in, of ditching round about our enemies, will not always do. We 
must learn to use other weapons than the pick and the spade. Our armies must be disciplined, and learn to 
fight. I have the satisfaction to reflect that our Massachusetts people, when they have been left to them 
selves, have been constantly fighting and skirmishing, and always with success. I wish the same valor, prudence and spirit had been discovered everywhere.

IT is worth the while of a person, obliged to write 
as much as I do, to consider the varieties of style. 
The epistolary is essentially different from the oratorical and the historical style. Oratory abounds with 
figures. History is simple, but grave, majestic and 
formal. Letters, like conversation, should be free, 
easy, and familiar. Simplicity and familiarity are the 
characteristics of this kind of writing. Affectation 
is as disagreeable in a letter, as in conversation, and 
therefore, studied language, premeditated method and 
sublime sentiments are not expected in a letter. Not 
withstanding which, the sublime as well as the beautiful, and the novel, may naturally enough appear, in 
familiar letters among friends. Among the ancients 
there- are two illustrious examples of the epistolary 
style, Cicero and Pliny, whose letters present you 
with models of fine writing, which have borne the 
criticism of almost two thousand years. In these 
you see the sublime, the beautiful, the novel and the 
pathetic, conveyed in as much simplicity, ease, freedom and familiarity, as language is capable of. 
</p><p>
Let me request you to turn over the leaves of the 
Preceptor to a letter of Pliny the younger, in which 
he has transmitted to these days the history of his 
uncle's philosophical curiosity, his heroic courage 
and his melancholy catastrophe. Read it, and say, 
whether it is possible to write a narrative of facts in a 
better manner. It is copious and particular in select 
ing the circumstances most natural, remarkable and 
affecting. There is not an incident omitted, which 
ought to have been remembered, nor one inserted 
that is not worth remembrance. It gives you an idea 
of the scene, as distinct and perfect, as if a painter 
had drawn it to the life before your eyes. It interests 
</p><p>
your passions us much as if you had been an eye 
witness of the whole transaction. Yet there are no 
figures or art used. All is as simple, natural, easy and 
familiar as if the story had been told in conversation, 
without a moment's premeditation. 
</p><p>
Pope and Swift have given the world a collection 
of their letters ; but I think, in general, they fall 
short, in the epistolary way, of their own eminence 
in poetry and other branches of literature. Very 
few of their letters have ever engaged much of my 
attention. Gay's letter concerning the pair of lovers 
killed by lightning, is worth more than the whole 
collection, in point of simplicity and elegance of 
composition, and as a genuine model of the epistolary 
style. There is a book, which I wish you owned, 
I mean Rollin's Belles Lettres, in which the variations 
of style are explained. 
</p><p>
Early youth is the time to learn the arts and 
sciences, and especially to correct the car and the 
imagination, by forming a style. I wish you would 
think of forming the taste and judgment of your children now, before any unchaste sounds have fastened 
on their ears, and before any affectation or vanity is 
settled on their minds, upon the pure principles of 
nature. Music is a great advantage ; for style de 
pends, in part, upon a delicate ear. The faculty of 
writing is attainable by art, practice and habit only. 
The sooner, therefore, the practice begins, the more 
likely it will be to succeed. Have no mercy upon 
an affected phrase, any more than an affected air, 
gait, dress or manners. 
Your children hare capacities equal to any thing. 
There is a vigor in the understanding and a spirit 
and fire in the temper of every one of them, which 
is capable of ascending the heights of art, science, 
trade, war or politics. They should be set to com 
pose descriptions of scenes and objects, and narrations 
of facts and events. Declamations upon topics and 
other exercises of various sorts should be prescribed 
to them. Set a child to form a description of a 
battle, a storm, a siege, a cloud, a mountain, a lake, 
a city, a harbor, a country seat, a meadow, a forest, 
or almost any thing that may occur to your thoughts. 
Set him to compose a narration of all the little 
incidents and events of a day, a journey, a ride or a 
walk. In this way a taste will be formed, and a 
facility of writing acquired. 
</p><p>
For myself, as I never had a regular tutor, I never 
studied any thing methodically, and consequently, 
never was completely accomplished in any thing. 
But, as I am conscious of my own deficiency in these 
respects, I should be the less pardonable, if I neglected the education of my children. In grammar, 
rhetoric, logic, my education was imperfect, because 
unmethodical. Yet I have perhaps read more upon 
these arts, and considered them in a more extensive 
view, than some others.

You will sec, by the newspapers, which I, from time 
to time, enclose, with what rapidity the colonies proceed in their political manoeuvres. How many calamities might have been avoided, if these measures 
had been taken twelve months ago, or even no longer ago than last December ? 
</p><p>
The colonies to the south are pursuing the sai 
maxims which have heretofore governed those to the 
north. In constituting their new governments, their 
plans are remarkably popular, more so than I could 
over have imagined ; even more popular than the 
" Thoughts on Government ; " and in the choice of 
their rulers, capacity, spirit, and zeal in the cause 
supply the place of fortune, family, and every other 
consideration which used to have weight with man 
kind. My friend Archibald Bullock, Esquire, is Governor of Georgia. John Rutledge, Esquire, is Governor 
of South Carolina. Patrick Henry, Esquire, is Governor of Virginia, &c. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="met colleague">Dr. Franklin</a> will be Governor of 
Pennsylvania. The now members of this city are all 
in this taste, chosen because of their inflexible zeal for 
independence. All the old members left out because 
they opposed independence, or at least were luke 
warm about it. Dickinson, Morris, Allen, all fallen, 
like grass before the scythe, notwithstanding all their vast advantages in point of fortune, family and abilities. I am inclined to think, however, and to wish that these gentlemen may be restored at a fresh election, because, although mistaken in some points, they 
are good characters, and their great wealth and numerous connexions will contribute to strengthen America, and cement her union. 
</p><p>
I wish I were at perfect liberty to portray before 
you all these characters in their genuine lights, and 
to explain to you the course of political changes in 
this province. It would give you a great idea of the 
spirit and resolution of the people, and sh jw you, in a 
striking point of view, the deep roots of American in 
dependence in all the colonies. But it is not prudent 
to commit to writing such free speculations in the 
present state of things. Time, which takes away the 
veil, may lay open the secret springs of this surprising 
revolution. But I find, although the colonies have differed in religion, laws, customs and manners, yet 
in the great essentials of society and government, they are all alike.

</p><p>
You seem to be situated in the place of greatest 
tranquillity and security of any upon the continent 
I may be mistaken in this particular, and an armament may have invaded your neighborhood, before now. But we have no intelligence of any such 
design, and all that we now know of the motions, 
plans, operations and designs of the enemy, indicates 
the contrary. It is but just that you should have a 
little rest, and take a little breath. 
</p><p>
I wish I knew whether your brother and mine have 
enlisted in the army, and what spirit is manifested by 
our militia for marching to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and Crown 
point. The militia of Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the lower counties are marching with 
much alacrity, and a laudable zeal to take care of 
Howe and his army at Staten Island. The army in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> is in high spirits, and seems determined to give the enemy a serious reception. The 
unprincipled and unfeeling and unnatural inhabitants 
of Staten Island are cordially receiving the enemy, 
and, deserters say, have engaged to take arms. 
They are an ignorant, cowardly pack of scoundrels. 
Their numbers are small, and their spirit less. 
</p><p>
It is sometime since I received any letter from you. 
The Plymouth one was the last. You must write 
me, every week, by the post, if it is but a few lines. 
It gives me many spirits. I design to write to the 
General Court requesting a dismission, or at least, 
a furlough. I think to propose that they choose four 
more members, or, at least, three more, that so, we 
may attend here in rotation. Two or three or four 
may be at home at a time, and the Colony properly 
represented notwithstanding. Indeed, while the Congress were employed in political regulations, forming 
the sentiments of the people of the Colonies into some consistent system, extinguishing the remainders 
of authority under the crown, and gradually erecting 
and strengthening governments .under the authority 
of the people, turning their thoughts upon the principles of polity and the forms of government, framing 
constitutions for the Colonies separately, and a limited 
and a defined Confederacy for the United Colonies, 
and in some other measures, which I do not choose 
to mention particularly, but which are now determined, or near the point of determination, I flattered 
myself that I might have been of some little use 
here. But now, these matters will be soon completed, and very little business will be to be done here, 
but what will be either military or commercial; 
branches of knowledge and business for which 
hundreds of others in our province are much better 
qualified than I am. I shall therefore request my masters to relieve me. 
</p><p>
I am not a little concerned about my health, which 
seems to have been providentially preserved to me, 
much beyond my expectations. But I begin to feel 
the disagreeable effects of unremitting attention to 
business for so long a time, and a want of exercise, 
and the bracing quality of my native air ; so that I 
have the utmost reason to fear an irreparable injury 
to my constitution, if I do not obtain a little relaxation. The fatigues of war are much less destructive 
to health, than the painful, laborious attention to 
debates, and to writing, which drinks up the spirits and consumes the strength. 
</p><p>
I am, &c.

I CANNOT omit the opportunity of writing you a line 
by this post This letter, will, I suppose, find you, in 
some degree or other, under the influence of the 
small pox. I The air is of very great importance. I 
don t know your physician, but I hope he wotf t deprive you of air, more than is necessary.

We had yesterday an express from General Lee in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, South Carolina, with an account of a 
brilliant little action between the armament under 
Clinton and Cornwallis, and a battery on Sullivan's 
Island, which terminated very fortunately for America. I will endeavour to enclose with this, a printed 
account of it It has given us good spirits here, and 
will have a happy effect upon our armies at New 
York and Ticonderoga. Surely our northern soldiers 
will not suffer themselves to be outdone by their brethren so nearly under the sun. I don l yet hear of any 
Massachusetts men at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. Our people must 
not flinch, at this critical moment, when their country 
is in more danger than it ever will be again, perhaps. 
What will they say, if the Howes should prevail 
against our forces, at so important a post as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, for want of a few thousand men from the Massachusetts ? I will likewise send you by this post, 
Lord Howe's letter and proclamation, which has let the cat out of the bag. These tricks deceive no longer. 
Gentlemen here, who either were or pretended to be deceived heretoforeVriow see or pretend to see through 
such artifices. I apprehend hi? Lordship is afraid of being attacked upon Staten Island, and is throwing out 
his barrels to amuse Leviathan, until his reinforcements shall arrive,

THIS has been a dull day to me. I waited the arrival 
of the post with much solicitude and impatience, but 
his arrival made me more solicitous still. " To be 
left at the Post Office," in your handwriting on the 
back of a few lines from the Doctor, was all that I 
could learn of you and my little folks. If you were 
too busy to write, I hoped that some kind hand would 
have been found to let me know something about you. 
Do my friends think that I have been a politician so 
long, as to have lost all feeling? Do they suppose I 
have forgotten my wife and^children ? Or are they 
so panic-struck with the loss of Canada, as to be 
afraid to correspond with me ? Or have they forgot 
ten that you have a husband, and your children a 
father ? What have I done, or omitted to do, that I 
should be thus forgotten and neglected in the most 
tender and affecting scene of my life ? Don't mis 
take me. I Don't blame you. Your time and thoughts 
must have been wholly taken up with your own and 
your family's situation and necessities ; but twenty 
other persons might have informed me. 
</p><p>
I suspect that you intended to have run slily 
through the small pox with the family, without letting 
me know it, and then have sent me an account that 
you were all well. This might be a kind intention, 
and if the design had succeeded, would have made 
me very joyous. But the secret is out. and I am left 
to conjecture. But as the faculty have this distemper 
so much under command, I will flatter myself with 
the hope and expectation of soon hearing of your recovery.

How are you all this morning ? Sick, weak, faint, 
in pain, or pretty well recovered ? By this time, you 
are well acquainted with the small pox. Pray, how do you like it ? 
</p><p>
We have no news. It is very hard that half a 
dozen or half a score armies can't supply us with 
news. We have a famine, a perfect dearth of this 
necessary article. I am, at this present writing, perplexed and plagued with two knotty problems in politics. You love to pick a political bone. So I will 
even throw it to you. 
</p><p>
If a confederation should take place, one great question is, how we shall vote. Whether each colony shall 
count one ? or whether each shall have a weight in 
proportion to its number, or wealth, or exports and 
imports, or a compound ratio of all ? Another is, 
whether Congress shall have authority to limit the dimensions of each colony, to prevent those, which 
claim by charter, or proclamation, or commission to 
the south sea, from growing too great and powerful, so as to be dangerous to the rest ? 
</p><p>
Shall I write you a sheet upon each of these questions ? When you are well enough to read, and I can find leisure enough to write, perhaps I may.

Gerry carried with him a canister for you. But he 
is an old bachelor, and what is worse, a politician, 
and what is worse still, a^kind of soldier, so that I sup 
pose he will have so much curiosity to see armies and 
fortifications, and assemblies, that you will lose many 
a fine breakfast at a time when you want them most.

Tell Betsey that this same Gerry is such another

THE post was later than usual to-day, so that I had 
not yours of July 24, till this evening. You have 
made me very happy, by the particular and favorable 
account you give me, of all the family. But I Don't 
understand how there are so many, who have no eruptions and no symptoms. The inflammation in the arm 
might do, but without these, there is no small pox. I 
will lay a wager, that your whole hospital has not had 
so much small pox as Mrs. Katy Quincy. Upon my 
word, she has had an abundance of it, but is finally 
recovered, looks as fresh as a rose, but pitted all over, 
as thick as ever you saw any one. I, this evening, 
presented your compliments, and thanks to Mr. Hancock, for his polite offer of his house, and likewise your compliments to his lady and Mrs. Katy.

Went this morning to the Baptist meeting, in hopes 
of hearing Mr. Stillman, but was disappointed. He was there, but another gentleman preached. His action 
was violent to a degree bordering on fury. His gestures unnatural and distorted. Not the least idea of 
grace in Ins motions, or elegance in his style. His 
voice was vociferous, and boisterous, and his composition almost wholly destitute of ingenuity. I wonder 
extremely at the fondness of our people for scholars 
educated at the southward, and for southern preachers. There is no one thing in which we excel them 
more, than in our university, our scholars and preachers. Particular gentlemen here, who have improved 
upon their education by travel, shine ; but in general, 
old Massachusetts outshines her younger sisters. Still 
in several particulars they have more wit than we. 
They have societies, the philosophical society particularly, which excites a scientific emulation, and 
propagates their fame. If ever I get through this 
scene of politics and war, I will spend the remainder 
of my days in endeavoring to instruct my country 
men, in the art of making the most of their abilities 
and virtues ; an art, which they have, hitherto, too 
much neglected. A philosophical society shall be 
established at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, if I have wit and address enough 
to accomplish it, sometime or other. Pray set brother Cranch's philosophical head to plodding upon this 
project. Many of his lucubrations would have been 
published and preserved, for the benefit of mankind, and for his honor, if such a club had existed. 
</p><p>
My countrymen want art and address. They want knowledge of the world. They want the exterior and superficial accomplishment of gentlemen, .upon which 
the world has set so high a value. In solia abilities 
and real virtues, they vastly excel, in general, any 
people upon this continent. Our New England peo- 
pie are awkward and bashful, yet they are pert, ostentatious and vain ; a mixture, which excites ridicule and gives disgust. They have not the faculty of 
showing themselves to the best advantage, nor Jie art 
of concealing this faculty ; an art and faculty which 
some people possess in the highest degree. Our deficiencies in these respects are owing wholly to the little intercourse we have with strangers, and to our 
inexperience in the world. These imperfections must be remedied, for New England must produce the 
heroes, the statesmen, the philosophers, or America will make no great figure, for some time. 
</p><p>
Our army is rather sickly at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and we live in daily expectation of hearing of some great 
event. May God Almighty grant it may be prosperous for America. Hope is an anchor and a cordial. 
Disappointment, however, will not disconcert us. 
</p><p>
If you will come to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> in September, I 
will stay as long as you please. I should be as proud 
and happy as a bridegroom.

MR. A. I sets off to-day, if the rain should not prevent 
him, with Colonel W hippie of Portsmouth, a brother 
of the celebrated Miss Hannah Whipple, a sensible 
and worthy man. By him, I have sent you two bundles of letters, which I hope you will be careful of. 
I thought I should not be likely to find a safer opportunity. By them, you will sec, that my private cor 
respondence alone is business enough for a lazy man. 
I think I have answered all but a few of those large bundles. 
</p><p>
A French vessel, n pretty large brigantine, deeply 
laden, arrived here yesterday, from Martinique. She 
had fifty barrels of limes, which are all sold, already, at 
such prices, that the amount of them will be sufficient 
to load the brig with flour. A trade, we sec, even now, 
in the midst of summer, is not totally interrupted by 
all the efforts of our enemies. Prizes are taken, in no 
small numbers. A gentleman told me a few days 
ago, that he had summed up the sugar, which has been 
taken, and it amounted to three thousand hogsheads, 
since which, two other ships have been taken, and 
carried into Maryland. Thousands of schemes for 
privateering are afloat in American imaginations. 
</p><p>
Some are for taking the Hull ships, with woollens, for Amsterdam and Rotterdam ; some are for the 
tin ships ; some for the Irish linen ships ; some, for outward bound, and others, for inward bound India- 
men; some for the Hudson's bay ships, and many, for West India sugar ships. Out of these speculations, many fruitless and some profitable projects will grow. 
</p><p>
We have no news from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. All is quiet as yet Our expectations are raised. The eyes of 
the world are upon Washington and Howe, and their armies. The wishes and prayers of the virtuous part 
of it, I hope, will be answered. If not, yet virtues grow out of affliction. I repeat my request that you 
would ask some of the members of the general court, if they can send me horses ; and if they cannot, that 
you would send them. I can live no longer without a servant and a horse.

MR. A. and Colonel Whipple are at length gone. 
Colonel Tudor went off with them. They went away, 
about three o clock this afternoon. I wrote by A. and 
Colonel Whipple too ; by the latter I sent two large 
bundles, which he promised to deliver to you. These middle States begin to taste the sweets of war. Ten 
thousand difficulties and wants occur, which they had 
no conception of before. Their militia are as clamorous, and impatient of discipline, and mutinous as 
ours, and more so. There has been seldom less than 
four thousand men in this city at a time, for a fort 
night past, on their march to New Jersey. Here they 
wait, until we grow very angry about them, for can 
teens, camp kettles, blankets, tents, shoes, hose, arms, 
flints and other dittoes, while we are under a very critical solicitude for our army at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, on account 
of the insufficiency of men. 
</p><p>
I want to be informed of the state of things with 
you ; whether there is a scarcity of provisions of any 
kind, of West India articles, of clothing ? Whether 
any trade is carried on, any fishery ? Whether any 
vessels arrive from abroad, or whether any go to sea 
upon foreign voyages. I wish to know, likewise, 
what posture of defence you are in ? What fortifications are at Nantaskct, at Long Island, Pettick's Island, 
&c., and what men and officers there are to garrison them ? We hear nothing from the Massachusetts, 
lately, in comparison of what we did, when the army was before <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>.

THIS is the anniversary of a memorable day in the 
history of America. A day when the principle of 
American resistance and independence was first asserted and carried into action. The stamp office fell 
before the rising spirit of our countrymen. I It is not 
impossible that the two grateful brothers may make 
their grand attack this very day. If they should, it is 
possible it may be more glorious for this country, than 
ever: it is certain, it will become more memorable. 
Your favors of August 1st and 5th came by yesterday's post. I congratulate you all upon your agreeable prospects. Even my pathetic little hero Charles, 
I hope, will have the distemper finely. It is very odd 
that the Doctor cannot put infection enough into his 
veins ; nay, it is unaccountable to me, that he has not 
taken it the natural way, before now. I am under 
little apprehension, prepared as he is, if he should. 
I am concerned about you, much more. So many 
persons about you sick, the children troublesome, your 
mind perplexed, yourself weak and relaxed. The 
situation must be disagreeable. The country air and 
exercise, however, will refresh you. 
</p><p>
I am put upon a committee, to prepare a device for 
a golden medal, to commemorate the surrender of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> to the American arms, and upon another, to 
prepare devices for a great seal, for the confederated 
States. There is a gentleman here of French extraction, whose name is Du Simitiere, a painter by profession, whose designs are very ingenious, and his 
drawings well executed. lie has been applied to for 
his advice. I waited on him yesterday, and saw his 
sketches. For the medal he proposes, Liberty, with 
her spear and pileus, leaning on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a>. 
The British fleet in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> harbor with all their sterns 
towards the town, the American troops marching in. 
For the seal, he proposes, The arms of the several nations from whence America has been peopled, r.s 
English, Scotch, Irish, Dutch, German, &c., each in a 
shield. On one side of them, Liberty with her pileus, 
on the other, a riflcr in his uniform, with his rifle gun 
in one hand, and his tomahawk in the other. This 
dress and these troops with this kind of armor being 
peculiar to America, unless the dress was known to 
the Romans. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="met colleague">Dr. Franklin</a> showed me yesterday a 
book, containing an account of the dresses of all the 
Roman soldiers, one of which appeared exactly like 
it. This M. du Simitiere is a very curious man. He 
has begun a collection of materials for a history of 
this revolution. He begins with the first advices of 
the tea ships. He cuts out of the newspapers every 
scrap of intelligence, and every piece of speculation, 
and pastes it upon clean paper, arranging them under 
the head of that State to which they belong, and intends to bind them up in volumes. He has a list of 
every speculation and pamphlet concerning independence, and another of those concerning forms of government 
</p><p>
Doctor F. proposes a device for a seal. Moses lifting up his wand, and dividing the red sea, and 
Pharaoh in his chariot overwhelmed with the waters. This motto. "Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God." 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="met colleague">Mr. Jefferson</a> proposed, The children of Israel in the wilderness, led by a cloud by day, and a pillar of 
fire by night and on the other side, Hengist and Horsa, the Saxon chiefs, from whom we claim the 
honor of being descended, and whose political principles and form of government we have assumed. 
</p><p>
I proposed, The choice of Hercules, as engraved by Gribelin, in some editions of Lord ShaAesbury's works. 
The hero resting on his club. Virtue pointing to her rugged mountain on one hand, and persuading him to 
ascend. Sloth, glancing at her flowery paths of pleasure, wantonly reclining on the ground, displaying 
the charms both of her eloquence and person, to seduce him into vice. But this is too complicated a group for a seal or medal, and it is not original. 
</p><p>
I shall conclude by repeating my request for horses and a servant. Let the horses be good ones. I 
can t ride a bad horse so many hundred miles. If our affairs had not been in so critical a state at New 
York, I should have run away before now. But I am determined, now, to stay until some gentleman is sent 
here in my room, and until my horses come. But the time will be very tedious.

The whole force is arrived at Staten Island.

MY letters to you are an odd mixture. They would 
appear to a stranger like the dish which is sometimes 
called omnium gatherum. This is the first time, I 
hclievc, that these two words were ever put together 
in writing. The literal interpretation I take to he "a 
collection of all things." But, as I said hcfore, the 
words having never hefore hcen written, it is not possible to be very learned in telling you what the Arabic, Syriac, Chaldaic, Greek and Roman commentators say upon the subject. Amidst all th.e rubbish that constitutes the heap, you will see a proportion of 
affection for my friends, my family and country, that 
gives a complexion to the whole. I have a very tender, feeling heart. This country knows not, and never 
can know the torments, I have endured. for its sake. 
I am glad it never can know,^ for it would give more pain to the benevolent and hurnane, than I could wish even the wicked and malicious to feel. 
</p><p>
I have seen in this world hut a little of that pure 
flame of patriotism which certainly bums in some 
breasts. There is much of the ostentation and affectation of it. I have known a few, who could not bear 
to entertain a selfish design, nor to be suspected by 
others of such a meanness ; but these are not the most 
respected by the world. A man must be selfish, even 
to acquire great popularity. He must grasp for him 
self, under specious pretences for the public good, and 
he must attach himself to his relations, connexions, 
and friends, by becoming a champion for their interests, in order to form a phalanx about him for his 
own defence, to make them trumpeters of his praise, and sticklers for his fame, fortune and honor. 
</p><p>
My friend Warren, the late Governor Ward, and 
Mr. Gadsden are three characters, in which I have 
seen the most generous disdain of every spice and 
species of such meanness. The two last had not great 
abilities, but they had pure hearts. Yet they had 
less influence than many others, who had neither so 
considerable parts, nor any share at all of their purity of intention. Warren has both talents and virtues 
beyond most men in this world, yet his character has 
never been in proportion. Thus it always is, and has 
been and will be. Nothing has ever given me more 
mortification than a suspicion that has been propagated of me, that I am actuated by private views, and 
have been aiming at high places. The office of chief 
justice has occasioned this jealousy, and it never will 
be allayed, until I resign it. Let me have my farm, 
family and goosequill, and all the honors and offices 
this world has to bestow, may go to tho?^, who deserve 
them better and desire them more. I court them not 
</p><p>
There are very few people in this world with whom I can bear to converse. I can treat all with decency 
and civility, and converse with them, when it is necessary, on points of business. But I am never happy 
in their company. This has made me a recluse, and will, one day, make me a hermit. I had rather build 
stone wall upon Penn's hill, than to be the first prince in Europe, or the first General, or first Senator in America.

YESTERDAY morning, I took a walk into Arch street 
to see Mr. Peale's Painter's room. Peale is from Maryland, a tender, soft, affectionate creature. He 
showed me a large picture, containing a group of figures, which, upon inquiry, I found were his family ; 
his mother and his wife's mother, himself and his wife, 
his brothers and sisters, and his children, sons and 
daughters, all young. There was a pleasant, a happy cheerfulness in their countenances, and a familiarity in their air towards each other. 
</p><p>
He showed me one moving picture. His wife, all 
bathed in tears, with a child about six months old, laid 
out upon her lap. This picture struck me prodigiously. 
He has a variety of portraits, very well done, but not 
so well as Copley's portraits. Copley is the greatest master that ever was in America. His portraits 
far exceed West's. Peale has taken <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="met colleague">Dr. Franklin</a>, Mrs. Washington, Mrs. Rush, 
Mrs. Hopkinson, Mr. Blair McClenachan and his little daughter in one picture, his lady and her little son 
in another. Peale showed me some books upon the 
art of painting. Among the rest one by Sir Joshua 
Reynolds, the President of the English Academy of 
painters, by whom the pictures of General Conway 
and Colonel Barre, in Faneuil Hall, were taken. He 
showed me too, a great number of miniature pictures. 
Among the rest, Mr. Hancock and his lady, Mr. Smith 
of South Carolina, whom you saw the other day in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, Mr. Custis, and many others. 
</p><p>
He showed me, likewise, draughts, or rather 
sketches, of gentlemen's seats in Virginia, where he 
had been, Mr. Corbin's, Mr. Page's, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a>'s, &c. Also a variety of rough drawings made 
by great masters in Italy, which he keeps as models. 
He showed me several imitations of heads, which he 
had made in clay, as large as the life, with his hands 
only. Among the rest, one of his own head and face, 
which was a great likeness. He is ingenious. He 
has vanity, loves finery, wears a sword, gold lace, 
speaks French, is capable of friendship, and strong 
family attachments, and natural affections. 
</p><p>
At this shop, I met Mr. Francis Hopkinson, late a Mandamus Counsellor of New Jersey, now a member 
of the continental Congress, who, it seems, is a native of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, a son of a prothonotary of this county, who was a person much respected. The son was 
liberally educated, and is a painter and a poet. I 
have a curiosity to penetrate a little deeper into the 
bosom of this curious gentleman, and may possibly 
give you some more particulars concerning him. He 
is one of your pretty, little, curious, ingenious men. 
His head is not bigger than a large apple, less than 
our friend Pemberton, or Doctor Simon Tufts. I 
have not met with anything in natural history more 
amusing and entertaining than his personal appearance yet he is genteel and well bred and is very social. 
</p><p>
I wish I had leisure and tranquillity of mind to 
amuse myself with those elegant, and ingenious arts of 
painting, sculpture, statuary, architecture and music. 
But I have not. A taste in all of them is an agreeable accomplishment. Mr. Hopkinson has taken in 
crayons with his own hand a picture of Miss Keys, a famous New Jersey beauty. He talks of bringing it to town, and in that case, I shall see it, I hope.

THE day before yesterday and yesterday, we expected 
letters and papers by the post, but by some accident, 
or mismanagement of the riders, no post is arrived 
yet, which has been a great disappointment to me. I 
watch with longing eyes for the post, because you

I long to hear that Charles is in as fair a way through

Poor Barrell is violently ill, in the next chamber to 
mine, of an inflammatory fever. I hear every cough, 
sigh and groan. His fate hangs in a critical suspense. 
The least thing may turn the scale against him. Miss 
Quincy is here, very humanely employed in nursing 
him. This goodness does her honor. Mr. Paine has 
recovered of his illness, and, by present appearances, 
is in better health than before. I hope it will not be

be blessed, this year, with a few storms, as happy as 
those which fell out last year in the beginning of 
</p><p>
September, they will do much for us. The British 
fleet, where they now lie, have not a harbor so convenient or safe as they had, last year. Another winter, will do much for us too. We shall have more 
and better soldiers. We shall be better armed. We 
shall have a greater force at sea. We shall have 
more trade. Our artillery will be greatly increased, 
our officers will have more experience, and our soldiers more discipline, our politicians more courage 
and confidence, and our enemies less hope. Our 
American commonwealths will be all completely 
formed and organized, and every thing, I hope, will go 
on with greater vigor. 
</p><p>
After I had written thus far, the post came in and 
brought me your favor of the 14th of August. Abby 
by this time, I conclude, is well and Charles, I hope, 
is broken out. Don't you recollect, upon this occasion, Doctor Bylcs's benediction to me, when I was inoculated ? As you will see the piquancy of it now, 
more than ever you could before, I will tell the story. 
</p><p>
After having been ten or eleven days inoculated, I 
lay lolling on my bed in Major Cunningham's chamber under the tree of liberty, with half a dozen young 
fellows as lazy as myself, all waiting and wishing for 
symptoms and eruptions, all of a sudden appeared at 
the chamber door, the reverend Doctor with his rosy 
face, many-curled wig and .pontifical air and gait. " I 
have been thinking," says he, " that the clergy of this 
town ought, upon this occasion, to adopt the benediction of the romish clergy, and, when we enter the 
apartment of the sick, to say in the foreign pronunciation, Pax tccum. " These words are spoken by 
foreigners, as the Doctor pronounced them, Pox take 
Vm. One would think Sir Isaac Newton's discovery 
of the system of gravitation did not require a deeper 
reach of thought than this frivolous pun. 
</p><p>
Your sentiments of the importance of education in 
women are exactly agreeable to my own. Yet the 
femmes sarantes, are contemptible characters. So 
is that of a pedant universally, how muchsoever of a 
male he may be. In reading history, you will generally observe, when you light upon a great character, 
whether a general, a statesman, or philosopher, some 
female about him, either in the character of a mother, 
wife or sister, who has knowledge and ambition above 
the ordinary level of women, and that much of his 
eminence is owing to her precepts, example or instigation, in some sliape or other. Let me mention an 
example or two. Sempronius Gracchus and Caius Gracchus, two great, though unfortunate men, are said 
to have been instigated to their great actions by their mother, who, in order to stimulate their ambition, told 
them, that she was known in Rome by the title of the mother-in-law of Scipio, not the mother of the Gracchi. Thus she excited their emulation and put them 
upon reviving the old project of an equal division of the conquered lands, (a genuine republican measure, 
though it had been too long neglected to be then practicable,) in order to make their names as illustrious as Scipio's. 
</p><p>
The great Duke who first excited the Portuguese to revolt from the Spanish monarchy, was spurred on to his great enterprise by a most artful and ambitious wife, and thus indeed you will find it, very generally.

MR. BASS arrived this day with the joyful news that 
you were all well. By this opportunity, I shall send 
you a canister of green tea by Mr. IJare. Before Mr. 
Gerry went away from hence, I asked Mrs. Yard to 
send a pound of green tea to you. She readily 
agreed. When I came home at night I was told Mr. 
G. was gone I asked Mrs. Y. if she had sent the 
canister? She said, yes, and that Mr. G. undertook to 
deliver it with a great deal of pleasure. From that 
time I flattered myself you would have the poor relief 
of a dish of good tea, under all your fatigues with the 
children, and under all the disagreeable circumstances attending the small pox ; and I never conceived a 
single doubt that you had received it, until Mr. Gerry's return. I asked him, accidentally, whether he 
delivered it and he said, " Yes, to Mr. Samuel Adams's lady." I was astonished. He misunderstood Mrs. Yard entirely, for upon inquiry, she affirms she 
told him, it was for Mrs. J. A. I was so vexed at this, 
that I have ordered another canister, and Mr. Hare 
has been kind enough to undertake to deliver it. How 
the dispute will be settled, I Don't know. You must 
send a card to Mrs.'s. A., and let her know, that the 
canister was intended for you, and she may send it 
you, if she chooses, as it was charged to me. It is 
amazingly dear. Nothing less than forty shillings, lawful money, a pound. 
</p><p>
I am rejoiced that my horses are come. I shall now be able to take a ride. But it is uncertain when 
I shall set off for home. I will not go at present Af fairs are too delicate and critical. The panic may 
seize I whom it will. It shall not seize me. I will stay here until the public countenance is better, or 
much worse. It must and will be better. I think it is not now bad. Lies by the million will be told you. 
Don t believe any of them. There is no danger of the communication being cutoff between the northern 
and southern colonies. I can go home when I please, in spite of all the fleet and army of Great Britain.

</p><p>
THIS day, I think, has been the most remarkable of 
all. Sullivan came here from Lord IIo\vc, five days 
ago,with a message, that his lordship desired a half an 
hour's conversation with some of the members of Congress in their private capacities. We have spent three 
or four days in debating, whether we should take 
any notice of it. I have, to the utmost of my abilities, during the whole time, opposed our taking any 
notice of it. But, at last, it was determined by a majority, " that the Congress being the representatives 
of the free and independent States of America, it was 
improper to appoint any of their members to confer 
in their private characters with his lordship. But 
they would appoint a committee of their body, to 
wait on him, to know whether he had power to treat 
with Congress upon terms of peace, and to hear any 
propositions that his lordship may think proper to 
make." 
</p><p>
When the committee came to be balloted for, Dr. 
Franklin and your humble servant were unanimously 
chosen. Colonel R. H. Lee and Mr. Rutlcclge had 
an equal number ; but, upon a second vote, Mr. Rut- 
ledge was chosen. I requested to be excused, but 
was desired to consider of it until to-morrow. My 
friends here advise me to go. All the stanch and intrepid are very earnest with me to go, and the timid 
and wavering, if any such there are, agree in the re 
quest So I believe I shall undertake the journey. I 
doubt whether his lordship will see us, hut the same 
committee will be directed to inquire into the state of 
the army at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, so that there will be business 
enough, if his lordship makes none. It would fill this 
letter-book to give you all the arguments, for and 
against this measure, if I had liberty to attempt it. 
His lordship seems to have been playing off a number 
of Machiavelian manoeuvres, in order to throw upon 
us the odium of continuing this war. Those who 
have been advocates for the appointment of this committee are for opposing manoeuvre to manoeuvre, and 
are confident that the consequence will be, that the 
odium will fall upon him. However this may be, my 
lesson is plain, to ask a few questions and take his answers. 
</p><p>
I can think of but one reason for their putting me 
upon this embassy, and that is this. An idea has 
crept into many minds here, that his lordship is such 
another as Mr. Hutchinson, and they may possibly 
think that a man who has been accustomed to penetrate into the mazy windings of Hutchinson's heart, 
and the serpentine wiles of his head, may be tolerably qualified to converse with his lordship.

Yesterday's post brought me yours of August 29. 
The report you mention " that I was poisoned upon my return home, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>," I suppose will be 
thought to be a prophecy delivered by the oracle, in mystic language, and meant, that I should be politically or morally poisoned by Lord Howe. But the prophecy shall be false.

</p><p>
YESTERDAY morning, I returned with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="met colleague">Dr. Franklin</a> and Mr. Rutleclgc from Slaten Island, where we met Lord Howe, and had about three hours conversation with 
him. The result of this interview will do no disservice to us. It is now plain that his lordship has no 
power, but what is given him in the act of Parliament. His commission authorizes him to grant par 
dons upon submission, and to converse, confer, consult and advise with such persons as he may think 
proper, upon American grievances, upon the instructions to Governors and the acts of Parliament, and if 
any errors should be found to have crept in, his majesty and the ministry were willing they should be rectified. 
</p><p>
I found yours of 31st of August and 2d of September. I now congratulate you on your return home with 
the children. I am sorry to find you anxious on account of idle reports. Don't regard them. I think our 
friends are to blame to mention such silly stories. What good do they expect to do by it ? 
</p><p>
My ride has been of service to me. We were absent but four days. It was an agreeable excursion. 
His lordship is about fifty years of age. He is a well 
bred man, but his address is not so irresistible as it has been represented. I could name you many 
Americans, in your own neighborhood, whose art, address and abilities are greatly superior. His head is rather confused, I think.

WE have at last agreed upon a plan for forming a regular army. We have offered twenty dollars and 
a hundred acres of land to every man who will enlist during the war. And a new set of articles of war are 
agreed on. I will send you, if I can, a copy of these resolutions and regulations.

I am at a loss what to write. News we have not. Congress seems to be forgotten by the armies. We 
are most unfaithfully served in the post office, as well as many other offices, civil and military. Unfaithfulness in public stations is deeply criminal. But there 
is no encouragement to be faithful. Neither profit, nor honor, nor applause is acquired by faithfulness.

Since I wrote the foregoing, I have not been able 
to find time to write you a line. Although I can 
not write you so often as I wish, you are never out of 
my thoughts. I am repining at my hard lot in being 
torn from you much oftener than I ought. I have 
often mentioned to you the multiplicity of my engagements, arid have been once exposed to the ridicule 
and censure of the world for mentioning the great 
importance of the business which lay upon me ; and 
if this letter should ever see the light, it would be 
again imputed to vanity that I mention to you how 
busy I am. But I must repeat it by way of apology 
for not writing you oftener. From four o clock in the 
morning until ten at night, I have not a single moment which I can call my own. I will not say, that I 
expect to run distracted, to grow melancholy, to drop in an apoplexy or fall into a consumption ; but I do 
say, it is little less than a miracle, that one or other of these misfortunes has not befallen me before now. 
</p><p>
Your favors of 15th, 20th, and 23d September, are 
now before me. Every line from you gives me inexpressible pleasure, but it is a great grief to me that I can write no oftener to you. There is one thing which 
excites my utmost indignation and contempt. I mean 
the brutality with which people talk to you of my 
death. I beg you would openly affront every man, 
woman, or child, for the future, who mentions any 
such thing to you, except your relations and friends, 
whose affections you cannot douht. I expect it of all 
my friends, that they resent, as affronts to me, every 
repetition of such reports. 
</p><p>
I shall enclose to you Governor Livingston's speech. The most elegant and masterly ever made in America. Depend upon it, the enemy cannot cut off the

I AM seated in a large library room with eight gentlemen round about me, all engaged in conversation. 
Amidst these interruptions, how shall I make it out to write a letter ? 
</p><p>
The first day of October, the day appointed by the 
charter of Pennsylvania for the annual election of 
Representatives, has passed away, and two counties 
only have chosen members, Bucks and Chester. The 
</p><p>
Assembly is therefore dead and the convention is dissolved. A new convention is to be chosen the beginning of November. The proceedings of the late convention are not well liked by the best of the Whigs. 
Their constitution is reprobated, and the oath with 
which they have endeavored to prop it, by obliging 
every man to swear that he will not add to, or diminish from, or any way alter that constitution, before he can vote, is execrated. 
</p><p>
We live in the age of political experiments. Among 
many that will fail, some I hope will succeed. But 
Pennsylvania will be divided and weakened, and rendered much less vigorous in the cause by the wretched ideas of government which prevail in the minds of many people in it.

I OUGHT to acknowledge with gratitude your constant 
kindness in writing to me by every post. Your favor of 29 September, I came by the last. I wish it had been in my power to have returned your civilities 
with the same punctuality, but it has not. Long before this, you have received letters from me, and newspaper containing a full account of the negotiation. The 
communication is still open, and the post-riders now do their duty, and will continue to do so. 
</p><p>
I assure you, we are as much at a loss, about affairs at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, as you are. In general, our Generals 
were outgeneraled on Long Island, and Sullivan and Stirling with a thousand men were made prisoners, in 
consequence of which and several other unfortunate circumstances, a council of war thought it prudent to 
retreat from that island and Governor's Island, and then from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. They are now posted at Haerlem, about ten or eleven miles from the city. They 
led behind them some provisions, some cannon and some baggage. Wherever the men of war have approached, our militia have most manfully turned their 
backs and run away, officers and men, like sturdy fellows ; and their panics have sometimes seized the regular regiments. One little skirmish on Montresor's Island ended with the loss of the brave Major 
Henley and the disgrace of the rest of the party. An other skirmish, which might indeed be called an action, ended in the defeat and shameful flight of the 
enemy with the loss of the brave Colonel Knowlton on our part. The enemy have possession of Paulus 
hook and Bergen point, places on the Jersey side of North river. By this time their force is so divided 
between Staten Island, Long Island, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, Paulus hook, and Bergen point, that I think they will do 
no great matter more this fall, unless the expiration of the term of enlistment of our army should disband 
it If our new enlistment fill up for soldiers during the war, we shall do well enough. Every body must encourage this. 
</p><p>
You are told that a regiment of Yorkers behaved 
ill, and it may be true ; but I can tell you that sever 
al regiments of Massachusetts men behaved ill too. 
The spirit of venality you mention is the most dreadful and alarming enemy America has to oppose. It 
is as rapacious and insatiable as the, grave. We are 
in the face Romnli non republica Flalonis. This 
predominant avarice will ruin America, if she is ever 
ruined. If God Almighty does not interpose by his 
grace to control this universal idolatry to the mammon 
of unrighteousness we shall be given up to the chastisements of his judgments. I am ashamed of the age I live in. 
</p><p>
You surprise me with your account of the prayers in public for an abdicated King, a pretender to the 
crown. Nothing of that kind is heard in this place, or any other part of the continent, but <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and 
the place you mention. This practice is treason against the State, and cannot be long tolerated.

THE riding has been so hard and rough, and the weather so cold, that we have not been able to push

The particulars you will have, before this reaches

IT is now generally believed that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a>

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=eaton" rel="city">Eaton</a>, at the Forks of Delaware river, in the State of Pennsylvania, 24 January, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>. 
</p><p>
WE have at last crossed the Delaware and are agree 
ably lodged at Easton, a little town situated on a point 
of land formed by the Delaware on one side, and the 
river Lehigh on the other. There is an elegant stone 
church here, built by the Dutch people, by whom the 
town is chiefly inhabited, and what is remarkable be 
cause uncommon, the Lutherans and Calvinists united 
to build this church, and the Lutheran and Culvinist 
ministers, allernately, officiate in it There is also a 
handsome Court House. The buildings, public and 
private, are all of limestone. Here are some Dutch Jews. 
</p><p>
Yesterday, we had the pleasure of seeing the Moravian mills in New Jersey. These mills belong to 
the society of Moravians in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=bethlehem" rel="city">Bethlehem</a> in Pennsylvania, They are a great curiosity. The building is of 
limestone, four stories high. It is not in my power to give a particular description of this piece of mechanism. A vast quantity of grain of all sorts is collected here. 
</p><p>
We have passed through the famous county of Sussex in New Jersey, where the Sussex Court House 
stands, and where, we have so often been told, the Tories are so numerous and dangerous. We met 
with no molestation nor insult. We stopped at some 
of the most noted Tory bouses, and were treated every 
where with the utmost respect. Upon the strictest inquiry I could make, I was assured, that a great majority 
of the inhabitants are stanch whigs. Sussex, they 
say, can take care of Sussex. And yet all agree that 
there are more Tories in that county than in any 
other. If the British army should get into that county, in sufficient numbers to protect the Tories, there 
is no doubt to be made, they would be insolent 
enough, and malicious and revengeful. But there is 
no danger, at present, and will be none, until that 
event takes place. The weather has been sometimes 
bitterly cold, sometimes warm, sometimes rainy, and 
sometimes snowy, and the roads abominably hard and 
rough, so that this journey has been the most tedious 
I ever attempted. Our accommodations have been 
often very bad, but much better and cheaper than 
they would have been, if we had taken the road from 
Peekskill to Morristown, where the army lies.

</p><p>
LAST evening, we arrived safe in this town, after the 
longest journey and through the worst roads and the 
worst weather that I have ever experienced. My horses performed extremely well. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> is a very pretty town, situated on Patapsco river, which empties itself into the great bay 
of Chesapeake. The inhabitants are all good Whigs, 
having some time ago banished all the Tories from 
among them. The streets are very dirty and miry, 
but every thing else is agreeable, except the monstrous prices of things. We cannot get a horse kept 
under a guinea a week. Our friends are well. 
</p><p>
The continental army is filling up fast, here and 
in Virginia. I pray that the Massachusetts may not 
fail of its quota in season. In this journey we have 
crossed four mighty rivers ; Connecticut, Hudson, 
Delaware and Susquehannah. The two first, we 
crossed upon the ice, the two last, in boats ; the last, 
we crossed a little above the place where it empties 
into Chesapeake Bay. 
</p><p>
I think I have never been better pleased with any 
of our American States than with Maryland. We 
saw most excellent farms all along the road, and what 
was more striking to me, I saw more sheep and flax 
in Maryland than I ever saw in riding a like distance 
in any other State. We scarce passed a farm with 
out seeing a fine flock of sheep, and scarce a house 
without seeing men or women dressing flax. Several 
times we saw women breaking and swingling this 
necessary article. 
</p><p>
I have been to meeting and heard my old acquaintance, Mr. Allison, a worthy clergyman of this town, whom I have often seen in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>.

</p><p>
THIS day has been observed in this place with exemplary decency and solemnity, in consequence of an 
appointment of the government, in observance of a 
recommendation of Congress, as a day of fasting. I 
went to the Presbyterian meeting, and heard Mr. Allison deliver a most pathetic and animating as well as 
pious, patriotic, and elegant discourse. I have seldom 
been better pleased or more affected with a sermon. 
The Presbyterian meeting house in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, stands 
upon a hill just at the back of the town, from whence 
we have a very fair prospect of the town and of the 
water upon which it stands, and of the country round 
it. Behind this eminence, which is the Beacon Hill 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, lies a beautiful meadow, which is entirely encircled by a stream of water. This most 
beautiful scene must be partly natural and partly artificial. Beyond the meadow and canal, you have a 
charming view of the country. Besides the meeting 
house, there is, upon this height, a large and elegant 
Court House, as yet unfinished within, and a small 
church of England, in which an old clergyman officiates, Mr. Chase, father of Mr. Chase one of the dele 
gates of Maryland, who, they say, is not so zealous a Whig as his son. 
</p><p>
I shall take opportunities to describe this town and 
State more particularly to you hereafter. I shall inquire into their religion, their laws, their customs, 
their manners, their descent and education, their learning, their schools and colleges, and their morals. 
It was said of Ulysses, I think, that he saw the manners of many men and many cities, which is like to 
be my case, as far as American men and cities extend, provided Congress should continue in the rolling 
humor, which I hope they will not I wish however that my mind was more at rest than it is, that I might 
be able to make more exact observation of men and things, as far as I go. 
</p><p>
When I reflect upon the prospect before me, of so long an absence from all that I hold dear in this world, 
I mean, all that contributes to my private personal happiness, it makes me melancholy. God Almighty's providence protect and bless you, and yours and mine.

I AM at last, after a great deal of difficulty, settled in 
comfortable quarters, but at an infinite expense. The 
price I pay for my board is more moderate than any 
other gentlemen give, excepting my colleagues, who 
</p><p>
are all in the same quarters and at the same rates, 
except Mr. Hancock, who keeps a house by himself. 
The prices of things here are much more intolerable 
than at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. The attempt of New England to 
regulate prices is extremely popular in Congress, who 
will recommend an imitation of it to the other States. 
For my own part I expect only a partial and a temporary relief from it, and I fear that, after a time, the 
evils will break out with greater violence. The water will flow with greater rapidity for having been 
dammed up for a time. The only radical cure will 
be to stop the emission of more paper, and to draw in 
some that is already out, and devise means effectually 
to support the credit of the rest. To this end we 
must begin forthwith to tax the people as largely as 
the distressed circumstances of the country will boar. 
We must raise the interest from four to six per cent. 
We must, if possible, borrow silver and gold from 
abroad. We must, above all things, endeavor, this 
winter, to gain further advantages of the enemy, that 
our power may be in somewhat higher reputation than it is, or rather, than it has been.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>,? February, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>. 
</p><p>
I THINK, in some letter I sent you since I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=bethlehem" rel="city">Bethlehem</a>, I promised you a more particular account of 
that carious and remarkable town. When we first 
came in sight of the town we found a country better 
cultivated and more agreeably diversified with prospects of orchards and fields, groves and meadows, 
hills and valleys, than any we had seen. When we 
came into the town, we were directed to a public 
house, kept by a Mr. Johnson, which, I think, was the 
best inn I ever saw. It belongs, it seems, to the society, is furnished at their expense, and is kept for 
their profit or at their loss. Here you might find 
every accommodation that you could wish for your self, your servants and horses, and at no extravagant rates neither. 
</p><p>
The town is regularly laid out, the streets straight 
and at right angles, like those in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. It 
stands upon an eminence, and has a fine large brook 
flowing on one end of it, and the Lehigh, a branch of 
the Delaware, on the other. Between the town and 
the Lehigh are beautiful public gardens. They have 
carried the mechanical arts to greater perfection here 
than in any place which I have seen. They have a 
set of pumps which go by water, which force the water up through leaden pipes from the river to the top 
of the hill, near a hundred feet, and to the top of a 
little building in the shape of a pyramid or obelisk, 
which stands upon the top of the hill, and is twenty or 
thirty feet high. From this fountain, water is conveyed in pipes to every part of the town. Upon the 
river they have a fine set of mills. The best grist 
mills and bolting mills that are any where to be found. 
The best fulling mills, an oil mill, a mill to grind bark for the lanyard, a dying house where all colors are died, machines for shearing cloth, &c. 
</p><p>
There are three public institutions here of a very 
remarkable nature. One, a society of the young men, 
another of the young women, and a third of the widows. There is a large building divided into many 
apartments, where the young men reside by them 
selves and carry on their several trades. They pay 
a rent to the society for their rooms and they pay 
for their board and what they earn is their own. 
There is another large building appropriated in the 
same manner to the young women. There is a governess a little like the lady abbess in some other institutions, who has the superintendence of the whole, 
and they have elders. Each apartment has a number 
of young women who are vastly industrious, some 
spinning, some weaving, others employed in all the 
most curious works in linen, wool, cotton, silver and 
gold, silk and velvet. This institution displeased me 
much. Their dress was uniform and clean, but Very 
inelegant. Their rooms were kept extremely warm 
with Dutch stoves : and the heat, the want of fresh 
air and exercise relaxed the poor girls in such a manner as must, I think, destroy their health. Their 
countenances were languid and pale. 
</p><p>
The society of widows is very similar. Industry 
and economy are remarkable in all these institutions. 
They showed us their church, which is hung with 
pictures of our Saviour, from his birth to his death, 
resurrection and ascension. It is done with very 
strong colors and very violent passions, but not in a 
very elegant taste. The painter, who is still living in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=bethlehem" rel="city">Bethlehem</a>, hut very old, has formerly been in Italy, 
the schilol of painting. They have a very good organ 
in their church, of their own make. They have a 
public building on purpose for the reception of the 
dead, to which the corpse is carried as soon as it expires, where it lies until the time of sepulture. 
</p><p>
Christian love is their professed object, but it is said 
they love money and make their public institutions 
subservient to the gratification of that passion. They 
suffer no lawsuits with one another, and as few as 
possible with other men. It is said that they now profess to be against war. They have a custom peculiar respecting courtship and marriage. The elders 
pick out pairs to be coupled together, who have no opportunity of conversing together, more than once or 
twice, before the knot is tied. The youth of the two sexes have very little conversation with one another before marriage. 
</p><p>
Mr. Hassey, a very agreeable, sensible gentleman, who showed us the curiosities of the place, told me, 
upon inquiry, that they profess the Augsburg confession of faith, are Lutherans rather than Calvinists, distinguish between bishops and presbyters, but have no idea of the necessity of the uninterrupted succession, are very liberal and candid in their notions in opposition to bigotry, and live in charity with all denominations.

FELL's point, which I mentioned in a letter this morn 
ing, has a considerable number of houses upon it. 
The shipping all lies now at this point. You have 
from it on one side a complete view of the harbor, 
and on the other a fine prospect of the town of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>. You see the hill in full view and the court 
house, the church and meeting house upon it. The 
court house makes a haughty appearance from this 
point. There is a fortification erected on this point, 
with a number of embrasures for cannon facing the 
Narrows which make the entrance into the harbor. 
At the Narrows they have a fort with a garrison in it. 
It is now a month and a few days since I left you. 
I have heard nothing from you nor received a letter

I have this day sent my resignation of a certain 
mighty office. I It has relieved me from a burden

MR. HALL, by whom this letter will be sent, will carry several letters to you, which have been written and

I am settled now, agreeably enough, in my lodgings. There is nothing in this respect that lies uneasily upon my mind, except the most extravagant price 
which I am obliged to give for every thing. My constituents will think me extravagant, but I am not. I 
wish I could sell or send home my horses, but I can not. I must have horses and a servant, for Congress 
will be likely to remove, several times, in the course of the ensuing year. I am impatient to hear from

We long to hear of the formation of a new army. We shall lose the most happy opportunity of destroying the enemy this spring if we do not exert ourselves 
instantly. We have from New Hampshire a Colonel Thornton, a physician by profession, a man of humor. 
He has a large budget of droll stories with which he entertains company perpetually. I heard, about twenty 
or five and twenty years ago, a story of a physician 
in Londonderry, who accidentally met with one of our 
New England enthusiasts, called exhortors. The fanatic soon began to examine the Doctor concerning 
the articles of his faith and what he thought of origin 
al sin. " Why," says the Doctor, " I satisfy myself 
about it in this manner. Either original sin is divisible or indivisible. If it is divisible, every descend 
ant of Adam and Eve must have a part and the share 
which falls to each individual at this day is so small a 
particle that I think it is not worth considering. If indivisible, then the whole quantity must have descended in a right line, and must now be possessed 
by one person only ; and the chances are millions and 
millions and millions to one, that that person is now in 
Asia or Africa, and thai I have nothing to do with it." 
I told Thornton the story, and that I suspected him to 
be the man. He said he was. He belongs to Londonderry.

Howe, as you know my opinion always was, will 
repent his mad march through the Jerseys. The

I have got into the old routine of war office and 
Congress, which takes up my time in such a manner 
that I can scarce write a line. I have not time to 
think nor to speak. There is a United States Lottery 
abroad. I believe you had better buy a ticket and 
make a present of it to our four sweet ones. Let us try their luck. I hope they will be more lucky than 
their papa has ever been, or ever will be. I am as well 
as can be expected. How it happens I Don't know, nor 
how long it will last. My disposition was naturally gay 
and cheerful, but the prospects I have ever had before 
me and these cruel times will make me melancholy. 
I, who would not hurt the hair of the head of any 
animal, I, who am always made miserable by tho 
misery of every susceptible being that comes to my 
knowledge, am obliged to hear continual accounts of 
the barbarities, the cruel murders in cold blood even 
by the most tormenting ways of starving and freezing, 
committed by our enemies, and continued accounts of 
the deaths and diseases contracted by their own imprudence. These accounts harrow me beyond description. These incarnate demons say in great composure, that " humanity is a yankee virtue, but that 
they are governed by policy." Is there any policy 
on this side of hell, that is inconsistent with humanity ? 
I have no idea of it. I know of no policy, God is my 
witness, but this, piety, humanity and honesty are the 
best policy. Blasphemy, cruelty and villany have 
prevailed and may again. But they won t prevail 
against America in this contest, because I find, the 
more of them are employed, the less they succeed.

YESTERDAY I had the pleasure of dining with Mr. Purviance. There are two gentlemen of this name in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, Samuel and Robert, eminent merchants 
and in partnership. We had a brilliant company, the 
two Mrs. Purviances, the two Lees, the ladies of the 
two Colonels R. H. and F., Mrs. Hancock and Miss 
Katy, and a young lady that belongs to the family. 
If this letter, like some other wise ones, should be intercepted, I suppose I shall be called to account for 
not adjusting the rank of these ladies a little better. 
Mr. Hancock, the two Colonel Lees, Colonel Whipple, 
Colonel Page, Colonel Ewing, the two Mr. Purviances 
and a young gentleman. I fancy I have named all the 
company. How happy would this entertainment 
have been to me if I could, by a single volition, have 
transported one lady about five hundred miles. But 
alas ! this is a greater felicity than falls to my share. 
We have voted to go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> next week. 
</p><p>
We have made General Lincoln a continental Major General. We shall make Colonel Glover a Brigadier. I sincerely wish we could hear more from General Heath. Many persons are extremely dissatisfied with numbers of the generaf officers of the highest 
rank. I Don't mean the Commander-in-chief, his character is justly very high, but Schuyler, Putnam, Spencer, Heath, are thought by very few to be 
capable of the great commands t\\cy hold. We hear of none of their heroic deeds of arms. I 
wish they would all resign. For my part I will vote upon the genuine principles of a republic for a new 
election of general officers annually, and every man shall have my consent to be left out, who does not give sufficient proof of his qualifications.

THE President, who is just arrived from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, 
came in, a few minutes ago, and delivered me yours 
of February 8, which he found at Susquchannah river,

to find that you have received so many letters from 
me, although I knew they contained nothing of importance. I feel a restraint in writing, like that which 
you complain of, and am determined to go on trifling. 
However, the post now comes regularly, and I believe you may trust it. I am anxious and impatient 
to hear of the march of the Massachusetts soldiers for 
the new army. They are much wanted. 
</p><p>
This city is a dull place, in comparison of what it 
was. More than one half of the inhabitants have removed into the country, as it was their wisdom to do. 
The remainder are chiefly Quakers, as dull as beetles. From these neither good is to be expected nor evil to 
be apprehended. They are a kind of neutral tribe, or the race of the insipids. Howe may possibly attempt this town, and a pack of sordid scoundrels, 
male and female, seem to have prepared their minds and bodies, houses and cellars for his reception ; but 
these are few, and more despicable in character than number. America will lose no .ing by Howe's gaining this town. No such panic will be spread by it 
now, as was spread by the expectation of it in December. However, if we can get together twenty thousand men by the first of April, Mr. Howe will 
scarcely cross Delaware river this year. New Jersey may yet be his tomb, where he will have a monument very different from his brother's in Westminster Abbey.
</p><p>
I am very uneasy that no attempt is made at Rhode Island. There is but a handful left there, who might 
be made an easy prey. The few invalids, who are left there, are scattered over the whole island, which 
is eleven miles in length, and three or four wide. Are New England men such sons of sloth and fear, 
as to lose this opportunity ? We may possibly remove again from hence, perhaps to Lancaster or Reading. 
It is good to change place ; it promotes health and spirits ; it does good many ways ; it does good to the place we remove from, as well as to that we remove to, and it does good to those who move. I long to be 
at home, at the opening spring, but this is not my felicity. I am tenderly anxious for your health and for the welfare of the whole house.

THE spring advances very rapidly, and all nature will soon be clothed in her gayest robes. The green grass which begins to show itself here and there, revives in my longing imagination my little farm and 
its dear inhabitants. What pleasure has not this vile war deprived me of? I want to wander in my meadows, to ramble over my mountains, and to sit, 
in solitude, or with her who has all my heart, by the side of the brooks. These beautiful scenes would contribute more to my happiness than the sublime 
ones which surround me. I begin to suspect that J have not much of the grand in my composition. The pride and pomp of war, the continual sound of 
drums and fifes as well played as any in the world, the prancings and tramplings of the Light Horse, numbers of whom are paraded in the streets every 
day, have no charms for me. I long for rural and domestic scenes, for the warbling of birds, and prattle of my children. Don't you think I am somewhat 
poetical this morning for one of my years, and considering the gravity and insipidity of my employment ? As much as I converse with sages and heroes, 
they have very little of my love or admiration. I should prefer the delights of a garden to the dominion of a world. I have nothing of Ceasar's greatness in 
my soul. Power has not my wishes in her train. The Gods, by granting me health and peace and competence, the society of my family and friends, 
the perusal of my books and the enjoyment of my farm and garden, would make me as happy as my 
nature and state will bear. Of that ambition which has power for its object, I Don't believe I have a spark in my heart. There are other kinds of ambition of which I have a great deal.
</p><p>
I am now situated in a pleasant part of the town, in Walnut street, on the south side of it, between Second and Third streets, at the house of Mr. Duncan, a 
gentleman from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, who has a wife and three children. General Wolcott, of Connecticut, and 
Colonel Whipple, of Portsmouth, are with me in the same house. Mr. Adams has removed to Mrs Cheesman's, in Fourth street, near the corner of Market street, where he has a curious group of company, 
consisting of characters as opposite as north and south. Ingersoll, the stamp man and Judge of Admiralty ; Sherman, an old puritan, as honest as an 
angel and as firm in the cause of American independence as mount Atlas ; and Colonel Thornton, as droli and funny as Tristram Shandy. Between the fun of 
Thornton, the gravity of Sherman, and the formal toryism of Ingersoll, Adams will have a curious life of it. The landlady, too, who has buried four husbands, one tailor, two shoemakers and Gilbert 
Tenant, and still is ready for a fifth, and well deserves him too, will add to the entertainment. Gerry and Lovell are yet at Miss Leonard's, under the auspices 
of Mrs. Yard. Mr. Hancock lias taken a house in Chestnut street, near the corner of Fourth street, near the State House.

We this day received letters from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="met colleague">Dr. Franklin</a> and Mr. Deane. I am not at liberty to mention 
particulars, but in general, the intelligence is very agreeable. I am now convinced there will be a general war.

" A PLOT, a plot ! a horrid plot ! Mr. A.," says my barber, this morning. " It must be a plot, first, because there is British gold in it ; second, because there 
is a woman in it ; third, because there is a Jew in it ; fourth, because I Don't know what to make of it" The barber means that a villain was taken up and 
examined yesterday, who appears, by his own confession, to have been employed, by Lord Howe and 
Jo. Galloway, to procure pilots to conduct the fleet up Delaware river and through the Chevaux de Frise. 
His confidant was a woman, who is said to be kept by a Jew. The fellow and the woman will suffer for their wickedness.

I KNOW not the time when I have omitted to write you so long. I have received but three letters from you since we parted, and these were short ones. 
Do you write by the post ? If you do, there must be some legerdemain. The post comes now constantly, once a week, and brings me newspapers, but 
no letters. I have ventured to write by the post, but whether my letters are received or not, I Don't know. If you distrust the post, the speaker or your 
uncle Smith will find frequent opportunities of conveying letters. 
</p><p>
I never was more desirous of hearing from home, and never before heard so seldom. We have reports 
</p><p>
here, not very favorable to the town of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. It is said that dissipation prevails, and that toryism abounds, 
and is openly avowed at the coffee-houses. I hope the reports are false. Apostasies in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> are more 
abominable than in any other place. Toryism finds worse quarter here. A poor fellow detected here as a spy, employed, as he confesses by Lord Howe and 
Mr. Galloway, to procure pilots for Delaware river and for other purposes, was this day at noon executed on the gallows, in the presence of an immense crowd 
of spectators. His name was James Moles worth. He lias been Mayor's Clerk to three or four Mayors. 
</p><p>
I believe you will think my letters very trifling indeed they are. I write in trammels. Accidents 
have thrown so many letters into the hands of the enemy, and they take such a malicious pleasure in exposing them, that I choose they should have nothing 
but trifles from me to expose. For this reason I never write any thing of consequence from Europe, 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, from camp, or any where else. If I could write freely, I would lay open to you the 
whole system of politics and war, and would delineate all the characters in cither drama, as minutely, although I could not do it so elegantly, as Tully did in his letters to Atticus. 
</p><p>
We have letters however from France by a vessel in at Portsmouth. Of her important cargo, you have heard. There is news of very great importance in the letters, but I am not at liberty. The news, however, is very agreeable.

YESTERDAY's post brought me your kind favor of March 8th, 9th, 10th, with a letter enclosed from each of my sons ; but where is my daughter's letter ? That 
is missing. I regret the loss of it much. You think I dont t write politics enough. Indeed I have a surfeit of them. But I shall give you now and then a taste, since you have such a gout for them. 
</p><p>
By a letter of 17th January, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="met colleague">Dr. Franklin</a>, Mr. Deane, 
and Dr. Lee met in Paris, and on the 28th December, had an audience of the Count do Vergcnnes, Secretary of state and minister of foreign affairs ; laid 
before him their commission with the articles of the proposed treaty of commerce ; were assured of the protection of his court, and that due consideration should be given to what they offered. Soon after, they 
presented a memorial on the situation of our States, drawn up at the minister's request, together with the articles of general confederation, and the demand for 
ships of war, agreeably to their instructions, copies of all which papers they gave to the Count d Aranda, the Spanish ambassador, to be communicated to his 
Court. They were promised an answer from the French Court, as soon as they could know the determination of Spain, with whom they design to act with 
perfect unanimity. \In the mean time, they are expediting several vessels laden with artillery, arms, ammunition and clothing. 
</p><p>
The ports of France, Spain and Florence, (that is Leghorn in the Mediterranean) are open to the American cruisers upon the usual terms of neutrality. They 
write for commissions to be given to privateers, and for more frequent arid authentic intelligence. Great 
efforts are now making by the British ministry to procure more troops from Germany. The princes in alliance with France have refused to lend any or to 
enter into any guarantee of Hanover, which England has been mean enough to ask, being apprehensive for 
that electorate, if she should draw from it any more of its troops. Four more regiments (two of them to be light horse,) are raising in Hesse, where there has 
been an insurrection on account of drafting the people, and now great sums of money are distributed for procuring men. They talk of ten thousand men in all, to be sent over this spring. 
</p><p>
The hearts of the French are universally for us, and the cry is strong for immediate war with Britain. 
Indeed, every thing tends that way, but the Count has reasons for postponing it a little longer. In the mean 
time preparations are making. They have twenty-six sail of the line manned and fit for the sea. Spain has 
seventeen sail in the same state, and more are fitting with such diligence, that they reckon to have thirty 
sail in each kingdom by April. This must have an 
immediate good effect in our favor, as it keeps the English fleet at bay, coops up their seamen, of whom 
they will scarce find sufficient to man their next set of transports, will probably keep Lord Howe's fleet more 
together, for fear of a visit, and leave us more sea room to prey upon their commerce, and a freer coast 
to bring in our prizes and supplies from abroad. The letter then mentions a circumstance much to our ad 
vantage, but this is a secret So strong is the inclination of the wealthy in France to assist us, that our Ambassadors have been offered a loan of two millions of 
livres, without interest, and to be repaid when the United States are settled in peace and prosperity. No 
conditions or securities are required. They have accepted this noble benefaction, and one half of it is 
paid into the hands of their Banker. On the strength of this supply, they are now in treaty for some strong ships. 
</p><p>
Lee is in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, confined, but otherwise treated well.

As you seem so inquisitive about politics, I will indulge you so far (indulge. I say. Observe that word, indulge ! I suppose you will say, it ought to have been, oblige,) as to send you a little more news from 
abroad. As foreign affairs are now become more interesting to us than ever, I dare say, your political curiosity has extended itself, ere this, all over Europe. The agent of the King of Prussia has often made 
proposals of a commercial nature to our agents in France, and expressed a desire that some American 
would go to Berlin, at the instance of his sovereign, who wishes to have a clear idea of the nature of our 
commerce. You must know that this prince has been, several years, dreaming of making his port of Embden an Amsterdam. We cannot as yet depend, that 
the Dutch merchants will venture to load directly to America at their own risk. The States, however, 
have declared, in answer to a fresh remonstrance of General York, that their ports are open to all nations, 
and that their trade, to and from their own colonies, shall be unmolested, their subjects complying with the 
ordinances issued by their high mightinesses. Their 
prohibition of exporting warlike stores extends to all 
British subjects. Without a very material and apparent success of the British arms in America, a loan 
would be very slowly negotiated for England in Amsterdam. Nothing hinders them now from selling out 
of the English funds, but their not knowing what to do 
with the money. For that country may be called the 
treasury of Europe, and its stock of specie is more or 
less, according to the necessities of the different princes in Europe. 
</p><p>
The credit of France has been very low of late. The mismanagement of the finances in the late King's 
reign, and the character of the late comptroller-general, M. de Clugny, had reduced it so low, that it was 
impossible to borrow anything considerable on perpetual funds. By life rents, something might be done. 
Perhaps a financier, in whose probity the world have 
a confidence, may restore their credit. The French stocks rose on the appointment of M. Taboureau. 
That it is possible for France to borrow, is certain, for at the time when M. Turgot was removed, he was 
negotiating a loan, and was likely to succeed, for sixty millions of guilders. The credit of Spain is extremely good. That kingdom may have what money 
it will, and on the best terms. The Emperor's credit is also good, not as Emperor, but from his hereditary 
dominions. Sweden and Denmark have good credit, the first the best. They have money at four per cent, 
and it is not long since the King of Sweden borrowed three millions of guilders at that interest, to pay off 
old debts at five per cent. His interest is paid punctually. Prussia has no credit, but his treasury is full 
by squeezing the last farthing from his people, and 
now and then he draws a little money from Holland, 
by reviving obsolete claims. The credit of the em 
press of Russia is very good, for she has punctually paid 
the interest of twelve millions of guilders, which she 
borrowed in her war with the Turk, and has lately 
paid off one million and a half of the principal. These 
arc the strongest recommendations to a mercantile 
people. As to America, in the present state of affairs, 
it is not probable that a loan is practicable, but should 
it appear evident that we are likely to support our in 
dependency, or should either France or Spain ac 
knowledge it, in either of these cases, we might have 
money, and when it shall be seen that we are punctual 
in our first payments of the interest, we shall have as much as we please.

You have had many rumors propagated among you 
which I suppose you know not how to account for. 
One was, that Congress, the last summer, had tied the 
hands of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a>, and would not let him 
fight, particularly on the White plains. This report 
was totally groundless. Another was, that at last, 
Congress untied the General, and then he instantly 
fought and conquered at Trenton. This also was 
without foundation, for as his hands were never tied, 
so they were not untied. Indeed, within a few days 
past, a question has been asked Congress, to the surprise, I believe, of every member there, whether the 
General was bound by the advice of a council of war ? 
No member of Congress, that I know of, ever harbored or conceived such a thought. " Taking the ad 
vice of a council of war " are the words of the General's instructions, but this meant only, that councils 
of war should be called and their opinions and reasons demanded, but the General, like all other commanders of armies, was to pursue his own judgment after all. 
</p><p>
Another report, which has been industriously circulated, is, that the General has been made by Congress, 
dictator. But this is as false as the other stories. Congress, it is true, upon removing to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, gave 
the General power to raise fifteen battalions, in addition to those which were ordered to be raised before, 
and to appoint the officers, and also, to raise three thousand horse, and to appoint their officers, and also, 
to take necessaries for his army, at an appraised value. But no more. Congress never thought of making him 
dictator, or of giving him a sovereignty. I wish I could find a correspondent, who was idle enough to 
attend to every report, and write it to me. Such false news, uncont radio ted, does more or less harm. 
Such a collection of lies would be a curiosity for posterity. 
</p><p>
The report you mention in your last, that the British administration had proposed to Congress a treaty 
and terms, is false, and without a color. On the contrary, it is now more than ever p&lt;.st a douht, that their 
fixed determination is, conquest and unconditional subjugation. But there will be many words and blows 
too, before they will accomplish their wishes. Poor, abandoned, infatuated nation ! Infatuation is one of 
the causes to which great historians ascribe many events, and if it ever produced any effect, it has produced this war against America. 
</p><p>
Arnold, who carries this, was taken in his passage from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>. He sailed with Harden for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. They

YOURS of 26th March came by this day's post. I am happy to hear you have received so many letters from me. You need not fear writing in your cautious way, 
by the post, which is now well regulated. But if your letters should be intercepted, they would do no 
harm. The F. turns out to be the man that I have seen him to be these two yean. He is in total neglect and disgrace here. I am sorry for it, because of 
the forward part he took in the beginning of the controversy. But there is certainly such a thing as falling away in politics, if there is none in grace.

Lee fares as well as a man in close prison can fare, I suppose, constantly guarded and watched. I fancy 
Howe will engage that he shall be treated as a prisoner of war, and in that case we shall all be easy. For my own part I don l think the cause depends 
upon him. I am sorry to see such wild panegyrics in your newspapers. I wish they would consider the wars against idolatry.

The fine new frigate, called the Delaware, Captain Alexander, has sailed down the river. I stood upon

ENCLOSED with this, you have a correspondence between the two Generals concerning the cartel for the 
exchange of prisoners. Washington is in the right, 
and has maintained his argument with a delicacy and 
dignity, which do him much honor, lie has hinted at 
the flagitious conduct of the two Howes towards their 
prisoners in so plain and clear a manner that he can 
not be misunderstood, but yet a decency and a delicacy are preserved, which is the more to be applauded, because the natural resentment of such atrocious 
cruelties renders it very difficult to avoid a more 
pointed language in describing them. They might, 
indeed, without much impropriety have been painted 
in crimson colors of a deeper die. If Mr. Howe's 
heart is not callous, what must be his feelings when he recollects the standings, the freezings, the pestilential diseases, with which he coolly and deliberately 
destroyed the lives of so many unhappy men ! If 
his conscience is not seared, how will he bear its 
lashes when he remembers his breach of honor, his 
breach of faith, his offence against humanity and divinity, his neighbor, and his God (if he thinks there is 
any such Supreme Being,) in impairing health that he 
ought to have cherished, and in putting an end to lives 
that he ought to have preserved, and in choosing the 
most slow, lingering and torturing death that he could 
have devised. I charitably suppose, however, that he 
would have chosen the shortest course and would have 
put every man to the sword or bayonet, and thereby 
have put an end to their sufferings at once, if he could 
have done it without detection. But this would have 
been easily proved upon him, both by friends and enemies, whereas, by hunger, frost and disease he might 
commit the murders with equal certainty, and yet be 
able to deny that he had done it. He might lay it to 
hurry, to confusion, to the fault of commissaries and 
other officers; nay, might deny that they were 
starved, frozen, and infected. He was determined to 
put them out of the way and yet to deny it ; to get 
rid of his enemies and yet save his reputation. But his reputation is ruined forever. 
</p><p>
The two brothers will be ranked by posterity with Pizarro, with Borgia, with Alva, and with others in 
the annals of infamy, whose memories are entitled to the hisses and execrations of all virtuous men. These two unprincipled men are the more detestable, because 
</p><p>
they were in the opposition at home, their connexions, friendships and interest lay with the opposition ; 
to the opposition they owed their rise, promotion and importance. Yet they have basely deserted their 
friends and party, and have made themselves the servile tools of the worst of men in the worst of causes. 
But what will not desperate circumstances tempt men to do, who are without principle and who have a 
strong, aspiring ambition, a towering pride and a tormenting avarice ? These two Howes were very poor, 
and they have spent the little fortunes they had in bribery at elections, and having obtained scats in Parliament, and having some reputation as brave men, they had nothing to do but to carry their votes and their valor to market, and, it is very true, they have sold them at a high price. 
</p><p>
Are titles of honor the reward of infamy ? Is gold a compensation for vice ? Can the one or the other 
give that pleasure to the heart, that comfort to the mind, which it derives from doing good ? from a consciousness of acting upon upright and generous principles, of promoting the cause of right, freedom and the happiness of men ? Can wealth, or titles soften 
the pains of the mind upon reflecting that a man has done evil and endeavored to do evil to millions, that 
lie has destroyed free governments, and established tyrannies? I would not be a Howe for all the empires 
of the earth and all the riches and glories thereof. Who would not rather be brave even though unfortunate in the cause of liberty ? who would not rather be 
Sidney than Monk ? However, if I am not deceived, misfortune as well 
as infamy awaits these men. They are doomed to defeat and destruction. It may take time to effect it, 
but it will certainly come. America is universally convinced of the necessity of meeting them in the field in firm battalion, and American fire is terrible.

I HAVE spent an hour this morning in the congregation of the dead. I took a walk into the Potter's field, 
a burying ground between the new stone prison and the hospital, and I never in my whole life was affected with so much melancholy. The graves of the 
soldiers, who have been buried in this ground from the hospital and bettering house during the course of 
the last summer, fall and winter, dead of the smallpox and camp diseases, are enough to make the heart 
of stone to melt away. The sexton told me that upwards of two thousand soldiers had been buried there, 
and by the appearance of the graves and trenches, it most probable to me, he speaks within bounds. 
To what causes this plague is to be attributed I Don't know. It seems to me that the want of tents, clothes, 
soap, vegetables, vinegar, vaults, &c., cannot account for it all. Oat meal and peas are a great preservative 
of our enemies. Our frying pans and gridirons slay more than the sword. Discipline, discipline is the 
great thing wanted. There can be no order nor cleanliness in an army without discipline. We have 
at last determined on a plan for the sick, and have called into the service the best abilities in physic and 
chirurgery that the continent affords. I pray God it may have its desired effect, and that the lives and 
health of the soldiers\may be saved by it. Disease has destroyed ten men for us, where the sword of the enemy has killed one. 
</p><p>
I Upon my return from my pensive, melancholy walk, I heard a piece of disagreeable news. That the 
ship Morris, Captain Anderson, from Nantes, with cannon, arms, gun-locks, powder, &c., was chased into 
Delaware Bay by two or three men of war ; that she defended herself manfully against their boats and barges, but finding no possibility of getting clear, she ran aground. The crew and two French gentlemen passengers got on shore, but the Captain, determined to 
disappoint his enemy in part, laid a train and blew up the ship, and lost his own life, unfortunately, in the 
explosion. I regret the loss of so brave a man much more than that of the ship and cargo. The people are fishing in order to have what they can, and I hope they will save the cannon. The French gentle 
men, it is said, have brought despatches from France to the Congress. I hope this is true. If it is, I will let you know the substance of it, if I may be permitted to disclose it.

MY barber just left the chamber. The following curious dialogue was the amusement during the gay moments of shaving. 
</p><p>
" Well, Burne, what is the lie of the day ? " " Sir, Mr told me, that a privateer from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> has 
taken two valuable prizes with sixteen guns each. I 
can scarcely believe it." " Have you heard of the 
success of the Rattlesnake, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, and the 
Sturdy Begqar, of Maryland, Mr. Burne ? These two 
privateers have taken eleven prizes, and sent them 
into the West India Islands ; nine transports and two 
guinea men." "Confound the ill luck, Sir; I was 
going to sea myself on board the Rattlesnake, and 
my wife fell a yelping. These wives are queer 
things. I told her, I wondered she had no more 
ambition." " Now," says I, " when you walk the 
streets and any body asks who that is ? The answer is 
" Burne the barber's wi/e," Should you not be better 
pleased to hear it said, " That is Captain Burners la 
dy" the captain of marines on board the Rattlesnake ? " 
" O," says she, * I would rather be called Burne the 
barber's wife, than Captain Burners widow. I Don't 
desire to live better than you maintain me, my dear." 
So it is, Sir, by this sweet, honey language, I am 
choused out of my prizes, and must go on *ith my 
soap and razors and pincers and combs. I wish she 
had my ambition.
</p><p>
If this letter should be intercepted by the Tories, 
they will get a booty. Let them enjoy it If some 
of their wives had been as tender and discreet as the 
barber's, their husbands ambition would not have led 
them into so many salt ponds. What an ignis fatuus 
this ambition is ? How few of either sex have arrived 
at Mrs. Burne's pitch of moderation, and are able to 
say, " I Don't desire to live better, and had rather be 
the Barber's wife, than the Captain's widow " ! Quite 
smart, I think, as well as philosophical.

I HAVE been lately more remiss than usual in writing 
to you. There has been a great dearth of news. 
Nothing from England, nothing from France, Spain 
or any other part of Europe, nothing from the West 
Indies nothing from Howe and his banditti, nothing 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a>. There are various conjectures that Lord Howe is dead, sick, or gone to 
England, as the proclamations run in the name of 
Will. Howe only, and nobody from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> can tell any thing of his lordship. 
</p><p>
I am wearied out with expectations that the Massachusctls troops would have arrived, ere now, at Head 
Quarters. Do our people intend to leave the continent in the lurch? Do they mean to submit? or 
what fatality attends them? With the noblest prize 
in view that ever mortals contended for, and with the 
fairest prospect of obtaining it upon easy terms, the 
people of the Massachusetts Bay are dead. Docs our 
state intend to send only half, or a third of their 
quota ? Do they wish to see another crippled, disastrous and disgraceful campaign, for want of an 
army ? I am more sick and more ashamed of my 
own countrymen, than ever I was before. The 
spleen, the vapors, the dismals, the horrors seem to 
have seized our whole state. More wrath than terror 
has seized rne. I am very mad. The gloomy 
cowardice of the times is intolerable in New England. 
Indeed I feel not a little out of humor from indisposition of body. You know I cannot pass a spring, 
or fall without an ill turn, and I have had one these four or five weeks. A cold as usual. Warm weather 
and a little exercise with a little medicine, I suppose, will cure me, as usual. I am not confined, but mope 
about and drudge, as usual, like a galley slave. I am a fool, if ever there was one, to be such a slave. 
I won t be much longer. I will be more free in some world or other. Is it not intolerable, that the 
opening spring, which I should enjoy with my wife and children, upon my little farm, should pass away, 
and laugh at me for laboring, day after day, and month after month, in a conclave, where neither taste, nor fancy, nor reason, nor passion* nor appetite can be gratified ? 
</p><p>
Posterity ! you will never know how much it cost the present generation to preserve your freedom! 
I hope you will mak a good use of it If you do not, I shall repent in Heaven that I ever took half the pains to preserve it.

YOUR favors of April 2d and 7th I have received. The enclosed Evening Post will give you some idea 
of the humanity of the present race of Britons. My barber, whom I quote as often as ever I did any authority, says, " he has read histories of cruelty and he 
has read romances of cruelty, but the cruelty of the British exceeds all that he ever read." For my own 
part I think we cannot dwell too much on this part of their character and conduct It is full of important 
lessons. If the facts only were known, in the utmost simplicity of narration, they would strike every pious 
and humane bosom in Great Britain with horror. Every conscience in that country is not callous, nor 
every heart hardened. The plainest relation of facts would interest the sympathy and compassion of all Europe in our favor. And it would convince every 
American, that a nation, so great a part of which is thus deeply depraved, can never be again trusted with 
power over us. I think that not only history should 
perform her office, but painting, sculpture, statuary 
and poetry ought to assist, in publishing to the world 
and perpetuating to posterity, the horrid deeds of our 
enemies. It will show the persecution we suffer in defence of our rights ; it will show the fortitude, patience, perseverance, and magnanimity of Americans, 
in as strong a light as the barbarity and impiety of Briton, in this persecuting war. Surely impiety consists in destroying with such hellish barbarity the rational works of the Deity, as much as in blaspheming and defying his majesty. 
</p><p>
If there is a moral law, if there is a divine law, 
(and that there is, every intelligent creature is conscious,) to trample on these laws, to hold them in con 
tempt and defiance is the highest exertion of wickedness and impiety that mortals can be guilty of. The 
author of human nature, who can give it its rights, will 
not sec it ruined, and suffer its destroyers to escape 
with impunity. Divine vengeance will, sometime or 
other, overtake the Alberts, the Philips and Georges, 
the Alvas, the Grislers, and Howes, and vindicate the 
wrongs of oppressed human nature. I think that 
medals in gold, silver and copper ought to be struck in commemoration of the shocking cruelties, the brutal 
barbarities, and the diabolical impieties of this war ; and these should be contrasted with the kindness, 
tenderness, humanity and philanthropy which have marked the conduct of Americans towards their prisoners. It is remarkable that the officers and soldiers 
of our enemies are so totally depraved, so completely destitute of the sentiments of philanthropy in their 
own hearts, that they cannot believe that such delicate feelings can exist in any other, and therefore 
have constantly ascribed that milk and honey with which we have treated them, to fear, cowardice and 
conscious weakness. But in this they are mistaken, and will discover their mistake too late to answer any good purpose for them.

</p><p>
Nothing would promote our cause more than Howe's march to this town. Nothing quickens and determines people so much as a little smart. The Germans, who are numerous and wealthy in this State, and who have very imperfect ideas of freedom, have 
a violent attachment to property. They are passionate and vindictive, in a degree that is scarcely credible to persons who are unacquainted with them, and 
the least injury to their property excites a resentment beyond description. A few houses and plantations 
plundered, (as many would be if Howe should come here,) would set them all on fire. Nothing would 
unite and determine Pennsylvania so effectually. The passions of men must cooperate with their reason in the prosecution of a war. The public may be 
clearly convinced, that a war is just, a.id yet, until their passions are excited, will carry it languidly on. 
The prejudices, the anger, the hatred of the English against the French contributes greatly to their valor 
and success. The British court and their officers hove studied to excite the same passions in the breasts of their soldiers against the Americans, well knowing 
their powerful effects. We, on the contrary, have treated their characters with too much tenderness. 
The Howes, their officers, and soldiers too, ought to be held up to the contempt, derision, hatred and abhorrence of the populace in every State, and of the 
common soldiers in every army. It would give me no pain to sec them burned or hanged in effigy, in every town and village.

ENCLOSED with this you will have an Evening Post 
containing some of the tender mercies of the barbarians to their prisoners. If there is a man, woman or 
child in America who can read these depositions 
without resentment and horror, that person has no 
soul, or a very wicked one. Their treatment of prisoners last year, added to an act of Parliament, which 
they have made, to enable them to send prisoners to 
England, to be there murdered with still more relent 
less cruelty in prisons, will bring our officers and soldiers to the universal resolution to conquer or die. 
This maxim u CONQUEROR DIE " never failed to raise a people who adopted it to the head of mankind. An 
express from Portsmouth, last night, brought us news of the arrival of arms and ordnance enough to enable us to take vengeance of these foes of human nature.

WE have no news here, except what we get from 
your country. The privateers act with great spirit, 
and are blessed with remarkable success. Some 
merchant ships are arrived this week from Ma ry land. 
They were first chased by men of war in attempting 
to get into Chesapeake Bay. They ran from them 
and attempted Delaware Bay. There they were 
chased again, whereupon they again shifted their course for Chesapeake, and got in safe, in spite of all 
the men of war could do. Thus you sec, we can and 
will have trade in spite of them, and this trade will probably increase fast. It requires time for the stream 
of commerce to alter its channel. Time is necessary 
for our merchants and foreign merchants to think, 
plan, and correspond with each other. Time, also, is 
necessary for our masters of vessels and mariners to 
become familiar with the coasts, forts and harbors of 
foreign countries, and a longer time still is needful for French, Spanish and Dutch masters and mariners to learn our coasts and harbors.

THE day before yesterday, I took a walk with my 
friend \VhippIc to Mrs. Wells's, the sister of the famous Mrs. Wright, I to see her wax-work. She has 
two chambers filled with it. In one, the parable of 
the prodigal son is represented. The prodigal is prostrate on his knees before his father, whose joy and grief and compassion all appear in his eyes and 
face struggling with each other. A servant maid, at the father's command, is pulling down from a closet 
shelf the choicest robes to clothe the prodigal, who is all in rags. At an outward door in a corner of the 
room, stands the brother, chagrined at this festivity, a servant coaxing him to come in. A large number of 
guests are placed round the room. In another chamber are the figures of Chatham, Franklin, Sawbridge, 
Mrs. Macauley and several others. At a corner is a miser, sitting at his table weighing his gold, his bag 
upon one side of the table and a thief behind him endeavoring to pilfer the bag. 
</p><p>
There is genius as well as taste and art discovered 
in this exhibition. But I must confess the whole 
scene was disagreeable to me. The imitation of life 
was too faint, and I seemed to be walking among a 
group of corpses, standing, sitting and walking, laugh 
ing, singing, crying and weeping. This art, I think, 
will make but little progress in the world. 
</p><p>
Another historical piece, I forgot, which is Elisha 
restoring to life the Shunamite's son. The joy of the 
mother upon discovering the first symptoms of life in 
the child is pretty strongly expressed. Dr. Chevot's 
wax-work in which all the various parts of the human 
body are represented for the benefit of young students 
in anatomy, and of which I gave you a particular 
description a year or two ago, were much more pleas 
ing to me. Wax is much fitter to represent dead 
bodies than living ones.

Upon a hint from one of our commissioners abroad, 
we are looking about for American curiosities to send 
across the Atlantic, as presents to the ladies. Mr. Kittenhousc's planetarium, Mr. Arnold's collection of varieties in the virtuoso way, which I once saw at Norwalk in Connecticut, Narragansct pacing marcs, mooses, 
wood-ducks, flying squirrels, red-winged blackbirds, cranberries and rattlesnakes, have all been thought of. 
Is not this a pretty employment for great statesmen as we think ourselves to be r I Frivolous as it seems, it may 
be of some consequence. Little attentions have great influence. I think, however, we ought to consult the ladies upon this point. Pray what is your opinion ?

GENERAL WARREN writes me that my farm never looked better than when lie last saw it, and that 
</p><p>
Mrs. was likely to outshine all the farmers. I wish I could sec it. But I can make allowances. He 
knows the weakness of his friend's heart, and that nothing flatters it more than praises bestowed upon a certain lady. I am suffering every day for want of my farm 
to ramble in. I have been now for near ten weeks in 
a drooping, disagreeable way, constant y loaded with 
a cold. In the midst of infinite noise, hurry and bustle, I lead & lonely, melancholy life, mourning the loss 
of all the charms of life, which are my family, and 
all the amusements that I ever had in life, which is 
my farm. If the warm weather, which is now com 
ing on, should not cure my cold, and make me better, I must come home. If it should, and I should 
get tolerably comfortable, I shall stay and reconcile 
myself to the misery I here suffer, as well as I can. 
I expect that I shall be chained to this oar until my 
constitution both of mind and body are totally destroyed and rendered wholly useless to myself and family for the remainder of my days. 
</p><p>
However, now we have got over the dreary, dismal, torpid winter, when we had no army, not even 
three thousand men to protect us against all our enemies, foreign and domestic, and now we have got together a pretty respectable army, which renders us 
tolerably secure against both, I doubt not we shall be able to persuade some gentleman or other in the Massachusetts to vouchsafe to undertake the dangerous office of delegate to Congress. However, I will neither whine nor croak. The moment our affairs are 
in a prosperous way and a little more out of doubt, that moment I become a private gentleman, the respectful husband of the amiable Mrs. A., of B., and 
the affectionate father of her children, two characters which I have scarcely supported for these three years past, having done the duties of neither.

I NEVER fail to enclose to you the newspapers, which

business a little, and ride and walk for the sake of my

Mr. Gorham and Mr. Russel are here with a petition from Charlestown. It grieves me that they are to 
return without success. I feel, most exquisitely, for the unhappy people of that town. Their agents have 
done every thing in their power or in the power of men to do, and the Massachusetts delegates have seconded their efforts to the utmost of their power, but all in vain. The distress of the States, arising from the quantity of money abroad, and the monstrous demands that would be made from Virginia, New Jersey, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and elsewhere, if a precedent should be once set, has determined the Congress, almost with 
tears in their eyes, to withstand this application at present. Every man expressed the utmost tenderness and humanity upon the occasion : but at the some 
time, every man, except the Massachusetts delegates, expressed his full conviction of the ill policy of granting any thing at present.

AFTER a series of the severest and harshest weather 
that ever I felt in this climate, we are at last blessed 
with a bright sun and a soft air. The weather here 
has been like our old easterly winds to me and southerly winds to you. The charms of the morning at 
this hour are irresistible. The streaks of glory dawning in the east ; the freshness and purity in the air, 
the bright blue of the sky, the sweet warblings of a great variety of birds intermingling with the martial 
clarions of a hundred cocks now within my hearing, all conspire to cheer the spirits. 
</p><p>
This kind of puerile description is a very pretty employment for an old fellow whose brow is furrowed 
with the cares of politics and war. I shall be on horseback in a few minutes and then I shall enjoy the 
morning in more perfection. I spent last evening at the war office with General Arnold. He has been 
basely slandered and libelled. The regulars say, u he fought like Julius Ca?sar." l I am wearied to death with the wrangles between military officers, 
high and low. They quarrel like cats and dogs. They worry one another like mastiffs, scrambling for 
rank and pay, like apes for nuts. I believe there is no one principle which predominates in human nature 
so much, in every stage of life, from the cradle to the grave, in males and females, old and young, black 
and white, rich and poor, high and low, as this passion for superiority. Every human being compares 
itself in its imagination with every other round about it, and will find some superiority over every other, 
real or imaginary, or it will die of grief and vexation. I have seen it among boys and girls at school, among 
lads at college, among practitioners at the bar, among the clergy in their associations, among clubs of friends, 
among the people in town meetings, among the members of a House of Representatives, among the grave 
councillors, on the more solemn bench of Justice, and in that awfully august body, the Congress, and on many of its committees, and among ladies every where ; but I never saw it operate with such keenness, ferocity and fury, as among military officers. They will 
go terrible lengths in their emulation, their envy and revenge, in consequence of it. 
</p><p>
So much for philosophy. I hope my five or six babes are all well. My duty to my mother and your 
father, and love to sisters and brothers, aunts and uncles. Pray how does your asparagus perform ? &c. I would give three guineas for a barrel of your cider. 
Not one drop is to be had here for gold, and wine is not to be had under six or eight dollars a gallon, and that 
very bad. I would give a guinea for a barrel of your beer. The small beer here is wretchedly bad. 
In short, I can get nothing that I can drink, and I believe I shall be sick from this cause alone. Hum at 
forty shillings a gallon, and bad water will never do, in this hot climate, in summer, when acid liquors are necessary against putrefaction.

AT half past four this morning I mounted my horse 
and took a ride in a road that was new to me. I 
went to Kensington and then to " Point-no-point" by 
land, the place where I went once before with a large 
company in the row galleys by water. That frolic 
was almost two years ago. I gave you a relation of 
it in the time, I suppose. The road to Point-no-point 
lies along the river Delaware, in fair sight of it and 
its opposite shore. For near four miles the road is 
as strait as the streets of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. On each side, 
are beautiful rows of trees, buttonwoods, oaks, walnuts, cherries and willows, especially down towards 
the banks of the river. The meadows, pastures and grass plats are as green as leeks. There are many 
fruit trees and fine orchards set with the nicest regularity. But the fields of grain, the rye and wheat 
exceed all description. These fields are all sown in ridges and the furrow between each couple of ridges 
is as plainly to be seen as if a swath had been mown along. Yet it is no wider than a ploughshare 
and it is as strait as an arrow. It looks as if the sower had gone along the furrow with his spectacles 
to pick up every grain that should accidentally fall into it. The corn is just coming out of the ground. 
The furrows struck out for the hills to be planted in, are each way as straight, as mathematical right lines ; 
and the squares between every four hills as exact as they could be done by plumb and line, or scale andcompass. 
</p><p>
I am ashamed of our farmers. They are a lazy, ignorant set ; in husbandry, I mean ; for they know infinitely more of every thing else than these. But 
after all, the native face of our country, diversified as it is with hill and dale, sea and land, is to me more agreeable than this enchanting artificial scene.

ARTILLERY Election! I wish I was at it or near 
it Yours of the 18th reached me this morning. The cause that letters are so long in travelling is, that 
there is but one post in a week, who goes from hence 
to Peekskill, although there are two that go from 
thence to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. Riding every day has made me 
better than I was, although I am not yet quite well. 
I am determined to continue this practice, which is very necessary for me. 
</p><p>
I rejoice to find that the town have had the wisdom 
to send but one Representative. The House last year 
was too numerous and unwieldy. The expense was 
too great. I suppose you will have a constitution 
formed this year. Who will be the Moses, the Lycurgus, the Solon? or have you a score or two of 
such ? Whoever they may be, and whatever form may be adopted, I am persuaded there is among the mass of our people a fund of wisdom, integrity and 
humanity, which will preserve their happiness in a tolerable measure. 
</p><p>
If the enemy comes to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> again, fly with your 
little ones, all of them to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. But they 
will scarcely get to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> this campaign. I admire 
your sentiments concerning revenge. Revenge in 
ancient days, (you will sec it through the whole Ro 
man History) was esteemed a generous and an heroic 
passion. Nothing was too good for a friend, or too 
bad for an enemy. Hatred and malice without limits 
against an enemy were indulged, were justified, and 
no cruelty was thought unwarrantable. Our Saviour 
taught the immorality of revenge, and the moral duty of 
forgiving injuries, and even the duty of loving enemies. 
Nothing can shew the amiable, the moral, the divine excellency of these Christian doctrines in a 
stronger point of light than the characters and conduct of Marius and Sylla, Crcsar, Pompey, Antony 
and Augustus, among innumerable others. Retaliation we must practise in some instances, in order to 
make our barbarous foes respect, in some degree, the 
rights of humanity. But this will never be done with 
out the most palpable necessity. The apprehension 
of retaliation alone will restrain them from cruelties 
which would disgrace savages. To omit it then would be crucify to ourselves, our officers and men. 
</p><p>
We are amused here with reports of troops removing from Rhode Island, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, Staten Island, &c ; 
waggons, boats, bridges, &c., prepared ; two old Indiamen cut down into floating batteries, mounting 
thirty-two guns, sent round into Delaware river, &c., 
&c ; but I heed it no more than the whistling of the 
zephyrs. In short, I had rather they should come to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> than not. It would purify this city of 
its dross. Either the furnace of affliction would refine it of its impurities, or it would be purged yet so as by fire. This town has been a dead weight upon 
us. It would be a dead weight upon the enemy. The mules here would plague them more than all their money.

YOURS of 23d June I have received. I believe there is no danger of an invasion your way, but the designs 
of the enemy are uncertain, and their motions a little mysterious. Before this letter is sealed, &gt;vhicli will

I rejoice at your fine season and at my brother 
C ranch's attention to husbandry. I am very glad he 
bought the farm and that he likes it so well. I pant 
for domestic life and rural felicity like his. I am 
better than I have been. But I dread the heats which 
are coming on. This day completes six months since 
I left you. I am wasted and exhausted in mind and 
body, with incessant applications to business, but if I 
can possibly endure it, will hold out the year. It is 
nonsense to dance backwards and forwards. After 
this year, I shall take my leave. 
</p><p>
Our affairs are in a fine prosperous train, and if 
they continue so, I can leave this station with honor. 
Next month completes three years that I have been 
devoted to the service of liberty. A slavery it has 
been to me, whatever the world may think of it. To 
a man whose attachments to his family are as strong 
as mine, absence alone from such a wife and such 
children would be a great sacrifice. But in addition to 
this separation what have I not done ? What have I not suffered ? What have I not hazarded ? These are questions that I may ask you, but I will ask such questions of none else. Let the cymbals of popularity 
tinkle still. Let the butterflies of fame glitter with their wings. I shall envy neither their music nor their 
colors. The loss of property affects me little. All other hard things I despise, but the loss of your company and that of my dear babes for so long a time, I consider as a loss of so much solid happiness. The tender social feelings of my heart which have distressed me beyond all utterance in my most busy aclive scenes as well as in the numerous hours of melancholy solitude, are known only to God and my ownsoul. 
</p><p>
How often have I seen my dearest friend, a widow, and her charming prattlers, orphans exposed to all 
the insolence of unfeeling, impious tyrants ! Yet I can appeal to my final Judge, the horrid vision has never for one moment shaken the resolution of my heart.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
We have had no news from camp for three or four 
days. Mr. Howe, by the last advices, was manoeuvring 
his fleet arid army in such a manner as give us expectations of an expedition, somewhere ; but whether to 
Rhode Island, Halifax, up the North River, or the Del 
aware, is left to conjecture. I am much in doubt 
whether he knows his own intentions. A faculty of 
penetrating into the designs of an enemy is said to be 
the first quality of a general, but it is impossible to 
discover the designs of an enemy who has no design 
at all An intention that has no existence, a plan 
that is not laid, cannot be divined. Be his intentions 
what they may, you have nothing to fear from him. 
He has not force to penetrate the country any where.

MY BEST FRIEND,

WE have a confused account from the northward of something unlucky at Ticonderoga, but cannot certainly tell what it is. I am much afraid we shall 
lose that post, as we did forts Washington and Lee ; 
and indeed, I believe we shall, if the enemy surround 
it. But it will prove no benefit to him. I begin to 
wish there was not a fort upon the continent. _ Discipline and disposition are our resources. It is our poicy to draw the enemy into the country, where we 
can avail ourselves of hills, woods, rivers, defiles, &c., 
until our soldiers are more inured to war. Howe and 
Burgoyne will not be able to meet this year, and if they 
were met, it would only be better for us, for we should 
draw all our forces to a point too. If they were met, 
they could not cut off the communication between the 
northern and southern States. But if the communication was cut off for a time, it would be no misfortune, for New England would defend itself, and the 
southern States would defend themselves. 
Colonel Miles is come out of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> on his parole. 
His account is, as I am informed, that Mr. Howe's 
projects are all deranged. His army has gone round 
the circle, and is now encamped in the very spot 
where he was a year ago. The spirits of the To r! es 
are sunk to a great degree, and those of the army too. 
The Tories have been elated with prospects of com 
ing to this city and triumphing, but are miserably disappointed. The Hessians are disgusted, and their general de Heister gone home in a miff.

TOUR kind favor of July 30th and 31st, I was banded 
me just now from the post office. I have regularly 
received a letter from you, every week excepting one, 
for a long time past, and as regularly send a line to 
you enclosing papers. My letters are scarcely worth 
sending. Indeed I Don't choose to indulge much 
speculation, lest a letter should miscarry, and free 
sentiments upon public affairs intercepted from me 
might do much hurt. 
</p><p>
Where the scourge of God and the plague of man 
kind is gone, no one can guess. An express from 
Smnepuxent, a place between the Capes of Delaware 
and the Capes of Chesapeake, informs, that a fleet of 
one hundred sail was seen off" that place last Thurs 
day. But whether this is fishermen's news, like that 
from Cape Ann, I know not. The time spends, and 
the campaign wears away, and Howe makes no great 
figure ytt How many men and horses will he cripple by this strange coasting voyage of five weeks ? 
</p><p>
We have given New England men what they will 
think a complete triumph in the removal of Generals 
from the northward and sending Gates there. I hope 
every part of New England will now exert itself to its utmost efforts. Never was a more glorious opportunity than Burgoyne has given us of destroying him 
by marching down so far towards <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>. Let New England turn out and cut off his retreat. Pray, continue 
to write me every week. You have made me merry 
with the female frolic with the miser. But I hope the 
females will leave off their attachment to coffee. I 
assure you the best families in this place have left off, 
in a great measure, the use of West India goods. We 
must bring ourselves to live upon the produce of our 
own country. What would I give for some of 
your cider ? Milk has become the breakfast of many 
of the wealthiest and genteelest families here. 
</p><p>
Fenno put me into a kind of frenzy to go home, by 
the description he gave me, last night, of the fertility 
of the season, the plenty of fish, &c., &c., &c., in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> and about it. I am condemned to this place, a 
miserable exile from every thing that is agreeable to me. God will my banishment shall not last long.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I THINK I have sometimes observed to you in conversation, that upon examining the biography of illustrious men, you will generally find some female about 
them, in the relation of mother, or wife, or sister, to whose instigation a great part of their merit is to be 
ascribed. You will find a curious example of this in the case of Aspasia, the wife of Pericles. She was a 
woman of the greatest beauty and the first genius. She taught him, it is said, his refined maxims of policy, his lofty imperial eloquence, nay, even composed the speeches on which so great a share of his reputation was founded. The best men in Athens frequented her house and brought their wives to receive lessons from her of economy and right deportment. 
Socrates himself was her pupil in eloquence, and gives her the honor of that funeral oration, which he delivers in the Menexenus of Plato. Aristophanes, in deed, abuses this famous lady, but Socrates does her honor. 
</p><p>
I wish some of our great men had such wives. By 
the account in your last letter, it seems the women in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> begin to think themselves able to serve their 
country. What a pity it is, that our generals in the 
northern districts had not Aspasias to their wives ! 
</p><p>
I believe the two Howes have not very great women for wives. If they had, we should suffer more 
from their exertions than we do. This is our good 
fortune. A woman of good sense would not let her 
husband spend five weeks at sea in such a season of 
the year. A smart wife would have put Howe in possession of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, a long time ago.

MY BEST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YOUR obliging favor of the 5th I came by yesterday's post, and I intended to have answered it by this morning's post, but was delayed by many matters, until lie gave me the slip. 
</p><p>
I am sorry that you and the people of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> were 
put to so much trouble, but glad to hear that such 
numbers determined to fly. The prices for carting 
which were demanded were detestable. I wish your 
fatigue and anxiety may not have injured your health. 
Don t be anxious for my safety. If Howe comes 
here, I shall run away, I suppose, with the rest. We 
arc too brittle ware, you know, to stand the dashing of 
balls and bombs. I wonder upon what principle the 
Roman senators refused to lly from the Gauls, and 
determined to sit with their ivory staves and hoary 
beards, in the porticoes of their houses, until the enemy entered the city and, although they confessed they 
resembled the gods, put them to the sword. I should 
not choose to indulge this sort of dignity ; but I confess I feel myself so much injured by these barbarian 
Britons, that I have a strong inclination to meet them 
in the field. This is not revenge, I believe, but there 
is something sweet and delicious in the contemplation of it There is in our hearts an indignation against 
wrong that is righteous and benevolent ; and he who is destitute of it, is defective in the balance of his affections and in his moral character. 
</p><p>
As long as there is conscience in our breasts, a moral sense which distinguishes between right and 
wrong, approving, esteeming, loving the former, and undermining and detesting the other, we must feel a 
pleasure in the punishment of so eminent a contemner of all that is right, and good, and just, as Howe is. 
They are virtuous and pious passions that prompt us to desire his destruction, and to lament and deplore 
his success and prosperity. The desire of assisting towards his disgrace is an honest wish. 
</p><p>
It is too late in life, my constitution is too much debilitated by speculation, and indeed, it is too late a period in the war, for me to think of girding on a sword. But if I had the last four years to run over again, I 
certainly would.

MY BEST FRIEND,

THE weather still continues cloudy and cool, and the 
wind easterly. Howe's fleet and army is still incognito. The gentlemen from South Carolina begin to 
tremble for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>. If Howe is under a judicial blindness, he may be gone there. But what will 
be the fate of a scorbutic army, cooped up in a fleet for 
six, seven, or eight weeks, in such intemperate weather as we have had ? What, will be their condition, 
landing on a burning shore abounding with agues and musquetoes, in the most unwholesome season of the 
whole year ? If he should get <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, or indeed 
the whole State, what progress will this make towards 
the conquest of America ? lie will stop the trade of 
rice and indigo, but what then ? Besides, he will get 
some ugly knocks. They are honest, sincere, and 
brave, and will make his life uncomfortable. 
</p><p>
I feel a strong affection for South Carolina for several reasons. 1. I think them as stanch patriots as 
any in America. 2. I think them as brave. 3. They 
arc the only people in America, who have maintained 
a post and defended a fort. 4. They have sent us a 
new delegate whom I greatly admire, Mr. Lnurcns, 
their Lieutenant Governor, a gentleman of great for 
tune, great abilities, modesty and integrity, and great 
experience too. If all the States would send us such 
men, it would be a pleasure to be here. 
</p><p>
In the northern department they begin to fight. 
The family of Johnson, the black part of it as well as 
the white are pretty well thinned. Rascals ! They 
deserve extermination. I presume Gates will be so 
supported that Burgoyne will be obliged to retreat. 
Ho will stop at Ticonderoga, I suppose, for they can 
maintain posts although we cannot. I think we shall 
never defend a post until we shoot a general. After 
that we shall defend posts, and this event in my opinion is not far off. No other fort will ever be evacuated without an inquiry, nor any officer come off with 
out a court martial. We must trifle no more. We 
have suffered too many disgraces to pass unexpiated. 
Every disgrace must be wiped off. 
</p><p>
We have been several days hammering upon money. We are contriving every way we can to re 
dress the evils we feel and fear from loo great a quantity of paper. Taxation as deep as possible is the 
only radical cure. I hope you will pay every tax that is brought you, if you sell my books, or clothes, or oxen, or your cows to pay it

MY BEST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THIS day completes three years since I stepped into 
the coach at Mr. Cushing's door, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, to go to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> in quest of adventures. And adventures 
I have found. I feel an inclination sometimes to write 
the history of the last three years, in imitation of 
Thucydides. There is a striking resemblance in several particulars between the Peloponnesian and the 
American war. The real motive to the former was a 
jealousy of the growing power of Athens by sea and 
land. The genuine motive to the latter was a similar jealousy of the growing power of America. The true 
causes which incite to war are seldom professed or acknowledged. 
</p><p>
We are now upon a full sea : when we shall arrive ) at a safe harbor, no mariner has skill and experience 
enough to foretell. But by the favor of Heaven, we shall make a prosperous voyage, after all the storms I and shoals are passed. 
</p><p>
5 o clock. Afternoon. 
</p><p>
It is now fair sunshine again and very warm. Not a word yet from Howe's fleet. The most general 
suspicion now is, that it is gone to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, South Carolina. But it is a wild supposition. It may be 
right however, for he is a wild General. 
</p><p>
We have been hammering to-day upon a mode of trial for the general officers at Ti. Whether an inquiry will precede the court martial, and whether the 
inquiry shall be made by a committee of Congress, or by a council of general officers, is not determined, but 
inquiry and trial both, I conjecture there will be. 
</p><p>
If Howe is gone to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, you will have a little quiet, and enjoy your corn, and rye, and flax, and 
hay, and other good things, until another summer. But what shall we do for sugar and wine and rum ? 
Why truly, I believe we must leave them ofT. Loaf sugar is only four dollars a pound here, and brown 
only a dollar for the meanest sort, and ten shillings for that a little belter. Every body here is leaving off loaf sugar, and most are laying aside brown. As to rum and wine, give me cider and I would compound. New England rum is but forty shillings a 
gallon. But if wine was ten dollars a bottle I would have one glass a day in water while the hot weather 
continues, unless I could get cider.

MY BEST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THIS morning we have heard again from the fleet 
At nine o clock at night on the fourteenth instant, up 
wards of a hundred sail were seen standing in between the capes of Chesapeake bay. They had been 
seen from the eastern shore of Virginia, standing off 
and on, for two days before. This method of coast 
ing along the shore, and standing off and on, is very 
curious. First, seen off Egg harbor, then several 
times, off the capes of Delaware, standing in and out, 
then off Sinnepuxent, then off the eastern shore of 
Virginia, then standing in to Chesapeake bay. How 
many men and horses will he lose in this sea ramble, 
in the heat of dog days ? Whether he is going to Virginia to steal tobacco, to North Carolina to pilfer pitch 
and tar, or to South Carolina to plunder rice and indigo, 
who can tell ? He will seduce a few negroes from their masters, let him go to which he will. But is this conquering America ? 
</p><p>
From the northward we learn that Arnold has 
marched with about two thousand men to the relief of 
fort Schuyler. Our people have given Sir John John 
son and his regulars, Tories and Indians, a very fine 
drubbing. The Indians scarcely ever had such a 
mauling. The devils are so frightened that they are 
all run away to howl and mourn. The papers en 
closed with this will give you more particular information. Can nothing be done at Rhode Island at this 
critical time? Opprobrium Novanglice ! What is 
become of all the Massachusetts continental troops ? 
Every regiment and every man of them is at the 
northward under Gates, and yet we are told they have 
not four thousand men fit for duty, officers included. 
And there are three regiments there from New Hampshire too. 
</p><p>
10 o clock at night. 
</p><p>
Just come in from Congress. We have within this hour received letters of General Schuyler and Lincoln, 
giving an account of the battle of Bennington, where in General Stark has acquired great glory, and so have 
his militia. The particulars are to be out in a hand bill to-morrow morning. I will enclose you one.

</p><p>
IT is now no longer a secret where Mr. Howe's fleet is. We have authentic intelligence that it is arrived 
at the head of Chesapeake bay, above the river Patapsco, upon which the town of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> stands. I 
wish I could describe to you the geography of this 
country, so as to give you an adequate idea of the situation of the two great bays of Chesapeake and Del 
aware, because it would enable you to form a conjecture concerning the object he aims at The distance across land from the heads of these bays is but 
small, and forms an isthmus, below which is a large 
peninsula, comprehending the counties of Accomac and Northampton in Virginia, the counties of Somerset and Worcester in Maryland, and the counties of 
Kent and Sussex in Delaware. His march by land to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> may be about sixty or seventy miles. 
I think there can be no doubt that he aims at this 
place, and he has taken this voyage of six weeks, long 
enough to have gone to London, merely to avoid an 
army in his rear. He found he could not march 
this way from Somerset court house without leaving 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a> in his rear. We have called out 
the militia of Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania, to oppose him, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a> is handy enough to meet him ; and as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a> saved <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> last winter by crossing the 
Delaware and marching to Morristown, and so getting in the rear of Howe, so, I conjecture, he will still find 
means to get in his rear between him and Chesapeake bay. You may now sit under your own vine and 
have none to make you afraid. I sent ofT my man and horse at an unlucky time, but if we should be obliged to remove from hence, we shall not go far. 
</p><p>
If Congress had deliberated and debated a month, they could not have concerted a plan for Mr. Howe 
more to our advantage, than that which he has adopted. He gives us an opportunity of exerting the 
strength of all the middle States against him, while <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and New England are destroying Burgoyne. Now is the time ! never was so good an opportunity for my countrymen to turn out and crush that vaporing, blustering bully to atoms.

MY BEST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
WE have an express to-day from Governor Johnson, 
Captain Nicholson and several other gentlemen, with 
an account that the fleet, to the number of two hundred and sixty -three sail, have gone up towards the 
head of Chesapeake bay. They lie over against the 
shore between the river Sassafras and the river Elk. 
We have also a letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a> acquainting us, that to-morrow morning at seven o clock, 
he shall march his army through the city of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, along Front street, and then turn up Chestnut 
street in his way to cross over the bridge at Schuylkill 
river; so that General Howe will have a grand continental army to oppose him, in very good season, 
aided by a formidable collection of militia. I like 
this movement of the General through the city. Such 
a show of artillery, waggons, light horse and infantry, 
which takes up a line of nine or ten miles upon their 
march, and will not be less than five or six hours pass 
ing through the town, will make a good impression 
upon the minds of the timorous whigs for their confirmation ; upon the cunning Quakers for their restraint ; and upon the rascally Tories for their confusion. 
</p><p>
I think there is a reasonable ground for confidence, 
with the favor of Heaven, that Howe will not be able to 
reach this city. Yet I really doubt whether it would 
not be more for our interest that he should come here, 
and get possession of the town. 
</p><p>
1. Because there are impurities here which will 
never be so soon or so fully purged away, as by that 
fire of affliction which Howe enkindles wherever he 
goes. 
</p><p>
2. Because it would employ nearly the whole of 
his force to keep possession of this town, and the rest 
of the continent would be more at liberty. 
</p><p>
3. We could counteract him here, better than in 
many other places. 
</p><p>
4. He would leave New England and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> 
at leisure to kill or catch Burgoyne. 
</p><p>
In all events you may rejoice and sing, for the sea 
son is so far gone that he cannot remove to you.

</p><p>
WE had, last evening, a thunder gust very sharp and 
violent, attended with a plentiful rain. The lightning 
struck in several places. It struck the Quaker alms- 
house in Walnut street, between Third and Fourth 
streets, not far from Captain Duncan's, where I lodge. 
They had been wise enough to place an iron rod upon 
the top of the steeple, for a vane to turn on, and had 
provided no conductor to the ground. It also struck 
in Fourth street, near Mrs. Checsman's. No person was hurt. 
</p><p>
This morning was fair, but now it is overcast and rains very hard, which will spoil our show, and wet the army. 
</p><p>
2 o clock. 
</p><p>
The rain ceased, and the army marched through the town between seven and ten o clock. The waggons went another road. Four regiments of light 
horse, Bland's, Baylor's, Sheldon's and Moylan's. Four grand divisions of the army, and the artillery 
with the matrosses. They marched twelve deep, and yet took up above two hours in passing by. General 
Washington and the other general officers with their aids on horseback. The Colonels and other field officers on horseback. We have now an army well 
appointed between us and Mr. Howe, and this army will be immediately joined by ten thousand militia, so 
that I feel as secure here as if I was at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>, but not so happy. My happiness is nowhere to be found but there. 
</p><p>
After viewing this fine spectacle and firm defence, I went to Mr. Duffield's meeting to hear him pray, as he did most fervently, and I believe he was most sincerely joined by all present, for its success. 
</p><p>
The army, upon an accurate inspection of it, I find to be extremely well armed, pretty well clothed and 
tolerably disciplined. Gill and Town, by the motto to their newspapers, will bring discipline into vogue in 
time. There is such a mixture of the sublime and the beautiful together with the useful in military discipline, that I wonder every officer we have is not 
charmed with it Much remains yet to be done. Our soldiers have not yet quite the air of soldiers. They 
don t step exactly in time. They Don't hold up their heads quite erect, nor turn out their toes so exactly 
as they ought. They Don't all of them cock their hats, and such as do, Don't all wear them the same way. 
</p><p>
A disciplinarian has affixed to him commonly tho 
ideas of cruelty, severity, tyranny, &c. But if I were 
an officer, I am convinced I should be the most decisive disciplinarian in the army. I am convinced there 
is no other cHeclivc way of indulging benevolence, humanity, and the tender social passions in an army. 
There is no other way of preserving the health and spirits of the men. There is no other way of making 
them active and skilful in war ; no other way of guarding an army against destruction by surprises, 
and no other method of giving them confidence in one another, or making them stand by one another in tho 
hour of battle. Discipline in an army is like the laws in civil society. There can be no liberty in a commonwealth where the laws are not revered, and most sacredly observed, nor can there be happiness or safety in an army for a single hour where the discipline is not observed. 
</p><p>
Obedience is the only thing wanting now for our salvation. Obedience to the laws in the States, and obedience to officers in the army.

MY BEST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
HOWE's army, at least about five thousand of them, besides his light horse, are landed upon the banks of 
the Elk river, and the disposition he has made of his forces indicates a design to rest and refresh both men 
and horses. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a> was at Wilmington last night, and his army is there to-day. The militia 
arc turning out with great alacrity both in Maryland and Pennsylvania. They are distressed for want of 
arms. Many have none, others have only little fowl ing pieces. However, we shall rake and scrape enough to do Howe's business, by the favor of Heaven. 
</p><p>
Howe must have intended that Washington should have sent his army up to fight Burgoyne. But he is 
disappointed. The kindness of Heaven towards uslias in nothing appeared more conspicuous, than in 
this motion of Howe. If the infatuation is not so universal as to seize Americans as well as him, it will 
prove the certain destruction of Burgoyne's army. The New England troops and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> troops are 
every man of them at Peekskill and with Gates. The Massachusetts men are all with Gates. General 
Washington has none but southern troops with him, and he has much the largest army to encounter. 
</p><p>
If my countrymen do not now turn out and do something, I shall be disappointed indeed. One fifth 
part of Burgoyne's army has been totally destroyed by Stark and Herkimer. The remainder must be 
shocked and terrified at the stroke. Now is the time to strike. New England men ! strike home.

MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE newspapers enclosed will give you all the intelligence of any consequence. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a>, with 
a very numerous army, is between Wilmington and the Head of Elk. Howe will make but a pitiful figure. 
The militia of four States are turning out with much alacrity and cheerful spirits. The continental army 
under Washington, Sullivan and Nash, besides, is in my opinion more numerous by several thousands than 
Howe's whole force. I am afraid that he will be frightened, and run on board his ships, and go away 
plundering to some other place. I almost wish he had <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, for then he could not get away. I really 
think it would be the best policy to retreat before him, and let him into this snare, where his army must 
be ruined. However, this policy will not be adopted. In a letter from good authority, Mr. Paca, we are 
informed that many dead horses have been driven on the eastern shore of Maryland. Horses thrown over board from the fleet no doubt. 
</p><p>
Prices current. Four pounds a week for board, 
besides finding your own washing, shaving, candles, 
liquors, pipes, tobacco, wood, &c. Thirty shillings a 
week for a servant. It ought to be thirty shillings for 
a gentleman and four pounds for the servant, because 
he generally eats twice as much, and makes twice as 
much trouble. Shoes, five dollars a pair. Salt, 
twenty-seven dollars a bushel. Butter, ten shillings 
a pound. Punch, twenty shillings a bowl. All the 
old women and young children are gone down to the 
Jersey shore to make salt. Salt water is boiling all 
round the coast, and I hope it will increase. For it is 
nothing but heedlessness and shiftlessness that pre 
vents us from making salt enough for a supply. But 
necessity will bring us to it. As to sugar, molasses, 
rum, &c., we must leave them off. Whiskey is used 
here instead of rum, and I Don't see but it is just as 
good. Of this, the wheat and rye countries can easily distil enough for the use of the country. If I cotrW-gefc cider I would be content. 
</p><p>
The business of the country has been in so critical and dangerous a situation for the last twelve months, 
that it was necessary the Massachusetts should have a full representation, but the expenses of living are 
grown so enormous that I believe it will be necessary to reduce the number of Delegates to three, after the campaign is over.

MT FRIEND, 
</p><p>
A LETTER from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a> was received last night by the President, which I read. It is dated the 29th; yesterday. 
</p><p>
The enemy are in possession of the Head of Elk, 
a little town at the head of the river Elk, in which 
they found a quantity of corn and oats belonging to 
the States. Waggons were so universally taken up 
in conveying away the valuable effects cf the inhabit 
ants, that none could be procured to transport this 
grain. Part of their army has advanced to Gray's 
hill, about two miles from the Head cf Elk, but whether 
to take post there, or only to cover while they remove 
their plunder from the Head of Elk, is uncertain. 
</p><p>
Our army is at Wilmington. We have many officers out reconnoitring the country and the enemy. 
Our scouting parties have taken between thirty and 
forty prisoners, and twelve deserters are come in from 
the fleet, and eight from the army. They say the 
men are generally healthy, but their horses have suffered much from the voyage. These prisoners and 
deserters are unable to give any other intelligence. 
The enemy give out that they are eighteen thousand 
strong. But these are like Burgoyne's, " make be lieves " and " insinuations." We know better ; and that they have not ten thousand. The militia from 
four Slates are joining <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a> in large 
numbers. The plan of their military operations this 
campaign is well calculated for our advantage. I 
hope we shall have heads and hearts to improve it. 
</p><p>
For my own part I feel a secret wish that they 
might get into this city, because I think it more for 
our interest that they should be cooped up here, than 
that they should run away again to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. But 
according to present appearances they will not be able 
to get here. By going into the Chesapeake bay, they 
have betrayed a dread of the fire works in the river 
Delaware, which indeed are formidable. They must 
make the most of their time, for they cannot ration 
ally depend upon so fine a season late in the fall and 
early in winter as they had the last year. September, October and November are all that remain. 
</p><p>
We expect hourly, advices from Gates and Arnold. 
We have rumors of an expedition to Long Island under Parsons, and another to Staten Island under Sullivan, but no regular accounts. I suppose it certain 
that such expeditions have been made, but know not the success.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, Monday, I September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
WE have now run through the summer, and although 
the weather is still warm, the fiercest of the heat is 
over. And although the extreme intemperance of the late season hat weakened and exhausted me, 
yet I think, upon the whole, I have got through it as well as upon any former occasion. 
</p><p>
A letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a>, dated Saturday, informs that our light parties have brought in four-and- 
twenty prisoners more. So that the prisoners and deserters since Mr. Howe landed I are near a hundred. 
The question now is, whether there will be a general engagement ? In the first place, I think, after all that 
has passed, it is not good policy for us to attack them, unless we can get a favorable advantage of them in 
the situation of the ground, or an opportunity to at tack a detachment of their army with superior numbers. It would be imprudent, perhaps, for us with our whole force to attack them with all theirs. 
</p><p>
But another question arises, whether Mr. Howe will 
not be able to compel us to a general engagement ? 
Perhaps he may ; but I make a question of it. Washington will maneuver it with him a good deal to avoid 
it A general engagement, in which Howe should be defeated, would be ruin to him. If we should be defeated, his army would be crippled, and perhaps we 
might suddenly reinforce our army, which he could 
not. However, all that he could gain by a victory- 
would be the possession of this town, which would be 
the worst situation lie could be in, because it would em 
ploy his whole force by sea and land to keep it and 
the command of the river. 
</p><p>
Their principal dependence is not upon their arms, 
I believe, so much as upon the failure of our revenue. 
To think they have taken such measures, by circulating counterfeit bills, to depreciate the currency, 
that it cannot hold its credit longer than this campaign. But they are mistaken 
</p><p>
We, however, must disappoint them by renouncing 
all luxuries, and by a severe economy. General 
Washington sets a fine example. He has banished 
wine from his table, and entertains his friends with 
rum and water. This is much to the honor of his 
wisdom, his policy, and his patriotism. And the ex 
ample must be followed by banishing sugar and all 
imported articles from our families. If necessity 
should reduce us to a simplicity of dress and diet be 
coming republicans, it would be a happy and a glorious necessity. 
</p><p>
Yours, yours, yours.

MY DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAD, yesterday, the pleasure of yours of , from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, and am happy to find that you have been able 
to do so well amidst all your difficulties. There is but one course for us to take, and that is to renounce 
the use of all foreign commodities. For my own part, I never lived in my whole life so meanly and 
poorly as I do now, and yet my constituents will growl at my extravagance. Happy should I be indeed, if I 
could share with you in the produce of your little farm. Milk, and apples, and pork, and beef, and the fruits of the garden would be luxury to me. 
</p><p>
We had nothing yesterday from the General. Howe's army are in a very unwholesome situation. 
Their water is very bad and brackish. There are frequent morning and evening fogs, which produce intermittent fevers in abundance. Washington has a 
great body of militia assembled and assembling, in addition to a grand continental army. Whether he will 
strike or not, I can't say. He is very prudent, you know, and will not unnecessarily hazard his army. 
By my own inward feelings, I judge, I should put more to risk if I were in his shoes, but perhaps he is 
right. Gansevoort has proved that it is possible to hold a post. Herkimer has shown that it is possible 
to fight Indians, and Stark has proved that it is practicable even to attack lines and posts with militia. I 
wish the continental army would prove tlmt any thing can be done. But this is sedition at least. I am weary, however, I own, with so much insipidity. 
</p><p>
St. Leger and his party have run away. So will Burgoyne. I wish Stark had the supreme command 
in the northern department. I am sick of Fabian systems in all quarters. The officers drink a longand 
moderate war. My toasl is, a short and violent war. They would call me mad and rash, &c., but I know 
better. I am as cool as any of them, and cooler too, for my mind is not inflamed with fear nor anger, 
whereas, I believe theirs are with both. If this letter should be intercepted and published, it would do as much good as another did two years ago. 
</p><p>
Adieu.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am determined to write freely to you this time. A 
certain great fortune and piddling genius, whose fame has 
been trumpeted so loudly, has given a silly cast to our 
whole doings. "We are between Hawk and Buzzard. 
We ought to have had in our hands, a month ago, the 
whole legislative, executive and judicial of the whole continent, and have completely modelled a constitution ; to 
have raised a naval power and opened all our ports wide; 
to have arrested every friend of government on the continent and held them as hostages for the poor victims in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, and then opened the door as wide as possible for 
peace and reconciliation. After this, they might have 
petitioned, negotiated, addressed, &c., if they would. Is 
all this extravagant? Is it wild ? Is it not the soundest 
policy ? One piece of news, seven thousand pounds of 
powder arrived last night. We shall send you some of it 
as soon as we can, but you must be patient and frugal. 
We are lost in the extensiveness of our field of business. 
We have a continental treasury to establish, a paymaster 
to choose, and a committee of correspondence, or safety, 
or accounts, or something, I know not what, that has con 
founded us all this day. 
</p><p>
Shall I hail you Speaker of the House, or councillor or 
what ? What kind of an election had you ? What sort 
of magistrates do you intend to make ? Will your new 
legislative or executive feel bold or irresolute ? Will your 
judicial hang, and whip, and fine, and imprison without 
scruple ? I want to see our distressed country once more, 
yet I dread the sight of devastation. You observe in 
your letter the oddity of a great man. He is a queer creature, but you must love his dogs if you love him, and 
forgive a thousand whims for the sake of the soldier and the scholar. 
</p><p>
Yours. 
</p>
