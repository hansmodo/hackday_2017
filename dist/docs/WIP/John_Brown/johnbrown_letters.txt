MR. HENRY L. STEARNS. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND, I have not forgotten my promise to 
write you ; but my constant care, & anxiety have obliged me to 
put it off a long time. I do not flatter myself that I can write any 
thing which will very much interest you : but have concluded to 
send you a short story of a certain boy of my acquaintance : & for 
convenience & shortness of name, I will call him John. This story 
will be mainly a narration of follies and errors; which it is to be 
hoped you may avoid ; but there is one thing connected with it, 
which will be calculated to encourage any young person to persevering effort ; & that is the degree of success in accomplishing his 
objects which to a great degree marked the course of this boy through 
out my entire acquaintance with him ; notwithstanding his moderate 
capacity; & still more moderate acquirements. 
</p><p>
John was born May 9th, 1800, at Torrington, Litchfield Co. Connecticut ; of poor but respectable parents : a deceudant on the side 
of his father of one of the company of the Mayflower who landed at Plymouth 1620. His mother was decended from a man who came 
at an early period to New England from Amsterdam, in Holland. Both his Father's and his Mother's Fathers served in the war of the 
revolution : His Father's Father ; died in a barn in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> while in the service ; in 1776. 
</p><p>
I can not tell you of anything in the first Four years of John's life worth mentioning save that at that early age he was tempted by 
Three large Brass Pins belonging to a girl who lived in the family 
& stole then}. In this he was detected by his Mother ; & after having a full day to think of the wrong; received from her a thorough 
whipping. When he was Five years old his Father moved to Ohio ; then a wilderness filled with wild beasts, & Indians. During the 
long journey, which was performed in part or mostly with an ox-team; he was called on by turns to assist a boy Five years older 
(who had been adopted by his Father & Mother) & learned to think he could accomplish smart things in driving the Cows; & riding 
the horses. Sometimes he met with Rattle Snakes which were very large; & which some of the company generally managed to kill. 
After getting to Ohio in 1805 he was for some time rather afraid of the Indians, & of their Rifles; but this soon wore off: & he used 
to hang about them quite as much as was consistent with good manners ; & learned a trifle of their talk. His father learned to 
dress Deer Skins, & at 6 years old John was installed a young Buck 
Skin. He was perhaps rather observing as he ever after remembered the entire process of Deer Skin dressing ; so that he could at 
any time dress his own leather such as Squirel, Raccoon, Cat, Wolf and Dog Skins, and also learned to make Whip Lashes, which 
brought him some change at times, & was of considerable service in many ways. At Six years old he began to be a rambler in the 
wild new country finding birds and squirrels and sometimes a wild Turkey's nest. But about this period he was placed in the school of 
adversity ; which my young friend was a most necessary part of his early training. You may laugh when you come to read about it ; 
but these were sore trials to John : whose earthly treasures were very few & small. These were the beginning of a severe but much 
needed course of dicipline which he afterwards was to pass through ; & which it is to be hoped has learned him before this time that the 
Heavenly Father sees it best to take all the little things out of his hands which he has ever placed in them. When John was in his 
Sixth year a poor Indian boy gave him a Yellow Marble the first he had ever seen. This he thought a great deal of; & kept it a good 
while ; but at last he lost it beyond recovery. It took years to heal the wound & I think he cried at times about it. About Five months 
after this he caught a young Squirrel tearing off his tail in doing it ; & getting severely bitten at the same time himself. He however 
held on to the little bob tail Squirrel ; & finally got him perfectly tamed, so that he almost idolized his pet. This too he lost ; by its 
wandering away; or by getting killed; & for a year or two John was in mourning ; and looking at all the Squirrels he could see to 
try & discover Bobtail, if possible. I must not neglect to tell you of a verry bad & foolish habbit to which John was somewhat addicted. 
I mean telling lies ; generally to screen himself from blame; or from punishment. He could not well endure to be reproached ; & I now 
think had he been oftener encouraged to be entirely frank ; by making frankness a kind of atonement for some of his faults ; he 
would not have been so often guilty of this fault ; nor have been (in after life) obliged to struggle so long with so mean a habit. 
</p><p>
John was never quarrelsome ; but was excessively fond of the hardest & roughest kind of plays ; & could never get enough [of] them. 
Indeed when for a short time he was sometimes sent to School the opportunity it afforded to wrestle & Snow ball & run & jump & 
knock off old seedy Wool hats ; offered to him almost the only compensation for the confinement, & restraints of school. I need not 
tell you that with such a feeling & but little chance of going to school at all: he did not become much of a schollar. He would 
always choose to stay at home & work hard rather than be sent to school; & during the warm season might generally be seen bare 
footed & bareheaded : with Buck skin Breeches suspended often with one leather strap over his shoulder but sometimes with Two. To 
be sent off through the wilderness alone to very considerable distances was particularly his delight ; & in this he was often indulged 
so that by the time he was Twelve years old he was sent off more than a Hundred Miles with companies of cattle ; & he would have 
thought his character much injured had he been obliged to be helped in any such job. This was a boyish kind of feeling but characteristic 
however. 
</p><p>
At Eight years old, John was left a Motherless boy which loss was complete & pearmanent for notwithstanding his Father again 
married to a sensible, intelligent, and on many accounts a very estimable woman; yet he never adopted her in feeling ; but continued 
to pine after his own Mother for years. This opperated very unfavourably uppon him ; as he was both naturally fond of females ; &, 
withall, extremely diffident ; & deprived him of a suitable connecting link between the different sexes ; the want of which might under 
some circumstances, have proved his ruin. 
</p><p>
When the war broke out with England, his Father soon commenced furnishing the troops with beef cattle, the collecting & driv 
ing of which afforded him some opportunity for the chase (on foot) of wild steers & other cattle through the woods. During this war 
he had some chance to form his own boyish judgment of men & measures : & to become somewhat familiarly acquainted with some who 
have figured before the country since that time. The effect of what he saw during the w r ar was to so far disgust him with Military affairs 
that he would neither train, or drill ; but paid fines ; & got along like a Quaker until his age finally has cleared him of Military duty. 
</p><p>
During the war with England a circumstance occurred that in the 
end made him a most determined Abolitionist: & led him to declare, 
or Swear : Eternal war with Slavery. He was staying for a short 
time with a very gentlemanly landlord since a United States Marshall 
who held a slave boy near his own age very active, inteligent and 
good feeling ; & to whom John was under considerable obligation 
for numerous little acts of kindness. The master made a great pet 
of John: brought him to table with his first company; & friends; 
called their attention to every little smart thing he said or did: & 
to the fact of his being more than a hundred miles from home with a 
company of cattle alone ; w r hile the negro boy (who was fully if not 
more than his equal) was badly clothed, poorly fed ; & lodged in cold weather ; & beaten before his eyes with Iron Shovels or any other 
thing that came first to hand. This brought John to reflect on the 
wretched, hopeless condition, of Fatherless & Motherless slave children : for such children have neither Fathers or Mothers to protect, 
& provide for them. He sometimes would raise the question is Gofl their Father f 
</p><p>
At the age of Ten years an old friend induced him to read a little 
history, & offered him the free use of a good library ; by ; which 
he acquired some taste for reading : which formed the principle part 
of his early education : & diverted him in a great measure from bad 
company. He by this means grew to be verry fond of the company, 
& conversation of old & intelligent persons. He never attempted to 
dance in his life; nor did he ever learn to know one of a pack of Cards 
from another. He learned nothing of Grammer j nor did he get at 
school so much knowledge of common Arithmetic as the Four ground 
rules. This will give you some general idea of the first Fifteen years 
of his life; during which time he became very strong & large of his 
age & ambitious to perform the full labour of a man ; at almost any 
kind of hard work. By reading the lives of great, wise & good men 
their sayings, and writings; he grew to a dislike of vain & frivolous 
conversation & persons; & was often greatly obliged by the kind 
manner in which older & more iuteligent persons treated him at 
their houses : & in conversation ; which was a great relief on account 
of his extreme bashfulness. 
</p><p>
He very early in life became ambitious to excel in doing anything 
he undertook to perform. This kind of feeling I would recommend 
to all young persons both male & female: as it will certainly tend 
to secure admission to the company of the more inteligeut ; & better 
portion of every community. By all means endeavour to excel in 
some laudable pursuit. 
</p><p>
I had like to have forgotten to tell you of one of John's misfortunes 
which set rather hard on him while a young boy. He had by some 
moans perhaps by gift of his father become the owner of a little Ewe 
Lamb which did finely till it was about Two Thirds grown ; & then 
sickened & died. This brought another protracted mourning season : 
not that he felt the pecuniary loss so much : for that was never his 
disposition ; but so strong & earnest were his atachments- 
</p><p>
John had been taught from earliest childhood to " fear God and 
keep his commandments j " & though quite skeptical he had always 
by turns felt much serious doubt as to his future well being ; & about 
this time became to some extent a convert to Christianity & ever 
after a firm believer in the divine authenticity of the Bible. With 
this book he became very familiar, & possessed a most unusual 
memory of its entire contents. 
</p><p>
Now some of the things I have been telling of; were just such 
as I would recommend to you : & I would like to know that you had 
selected these out ; & adopted them as part of your own plan of life ; 
& I wish you to have some deffinite plan. Many seem to have 
none ; & others never stick to .any that they do form. This was not 
the case with John. He followed up^with tenacity whatever he set 
about, so long as it answered his general purpose : & hence he rarely 
failed in some good degree to effect the things he undertook. This 
was so much the case that he habitually expected to succeed in his 
undertakings. With this feeling should be coupled ; the consciousness 
that our plans are right in themselves. 
</p><p>
During the period I have named, John had acquired a kind of 
ownership to certain animals of some little value but as he had come 
to understand that the title of minors might be a little imperfect : he 
had recourse to various means in order to secure a more independent; 
& perfect right of property. One of those means was to exchange 
with his Father for something of far less value. Another was by 
trading with others persons for something his Father had never 
owned. Older persons have some times found difficulty with titles. 
</p><p>
From Fifteen to Twenty years old, he spent most of his time work 
ing at the Tanner & Currier's trade keeping Bachelors hall } & he 
officiating as Cook ; & for most of the time as foreman of the establishment under his Father. During this period he found much trouble 
with some of the bad habits I have mentioned & with some that I 
have not told you off: his conscience urging him forward with great 
power in this matter : but his close attention to business ; & success 
in its management ; together with the way he got along with a company of men, & boys ; made him quite a favorite with the serious & 
more inteligent portion of older persons. This was so much the case ; 
& secured for him so many little notices from those he esteemed ; 
that his vanity was very much fed by it : & he came forward to man 
hood quite full of self-conceit ; & self-confident; notwithstanding his 
extreme bashfulness. A younger brother 1 used sometimes to remind 
him of this : & to repeat to him this expression which you may some 
where find, a A King against whom there is no rising up." The 
habit so early formed of being obeyed rendered him in after life too 
much disposed to speak in an imperious or dictating way. From Fifteen years & upward he felt a good deal of anxiety to learn ; but could 
only read & study a little ; both for want of time ; & on account of inflammation of the eyes. He however managed by the help of books 
to make himself tolerably well acquainted with common arithmetic ; & Surveying j which he practiced more or less after he was Twenty years old. 
</p><p>
At a little past Twenty years led by his own inclination & 
prompted also by his Father, he married a remarkably plain ; but 
neat industrious & economical girl ; of excellent character ; earnest 
piety ; & good practical common sense ; about one year younger than 
himself. This woman by her mild, frank, & more than all else: 
by her very consistent conduct; acquired & ever while she lived 
maintained a most powerful ; & good influence over him. Her plain 
but kind admonitions generally had the right effect ; without arousing 
his haughty obstinate temper. John began early in life to discover a 
great liking to fine Cattle, Horses, Sheep, & Swine; & as soon as 
circumstances would enable him he began to be a practical Shep 
herd: it being a calling for which in early life he had a kind of 
enthusiastic longing : together with the idea that as a business it bid 
fair to afford him the means of carrying out his greatest or principal 
object. I have now given you a kind of general idea of the early life 
of this boy ; & if I believed it would be worth the trouble ; or afford 
much interest to any good feeling person: I might be tempted to 
tell you something of his course in after life ; or manhood. I do not 
say that I will do it. 
</p><p>
You will discover that in using up my half sheets to save paper ; I have written Two pages, so that one does not follow the other as it 
should. I have no time to write it over; & but for unavoidable hindrances in traveling I can hardly say when I should have written 
what I have. With an honest desire for your best good, I subscribe myself,

DEAR FATHER, Yours of the 22d, telling us of the death of 
"brother King, is received. I must say, that, with all his imperfections 
and faults, I certainly feel that if he has not been a very warm 
hearted, yet he has been a steady, friend, and on some accounts a 
useful friend; and I mourn his frailties and death sincerely. You 
say he expected to die, but do not say how he felt in regard to the 
change as it drew near. I have to confess my unfaithfulness to my 
friend in regard to his most important interest. I did not fail to write 
you, as soon as I returned myself, from want of inclination, but be 
cause I thought it would please you quite as much to get a letter from 
Jason. We are getting along moderately with our business, but when 
we shall be able to close it up will be difficult to say, for we still 
continue to receive large quantities of wool. Prices rather improve. 
We expect to be ready to close up all the lots Jerry brought on in a 
very few days. Have contracted away the lowest he brought at 
twenty-five cents per pound. There is no doubt but we might make 
the most advantageous exchanges of wool for any description of 
woollen goods that are wanted in the country. We shall probably 
take hold of the business with a view to such exchanges another year, 
if we continue the wool business. We find no difficulty in disposing 
of the very coarsest wools, now that we have learned better where to 
sell them, and can turn them cash. Please write often, and let us hear 
how you all get along, and what you think proper to say to us. 
Your affectionate son,

DEAR FATHER, Yours, dated 2d and 3d December, we received this evening. It is perhaps needless for me to say that I am 
always grateful for everything of that kind I receive from you, and that I think I have your whole correspondence for nearly thirty years 
laid up to remember you by, I mean, of course, what you have directed to me. I would further say, that I feel grateful to you, and my 
brother, for calling to see my dear afflicted wife and children in their calamity. It is a great comfort that / can in my imagination see my 
always kind and affectionate old father with them, while at the same time the responsibilities I have assumed constrain me to be absent, 
very contrary to my feeling (and it may be contrary to my duty, too ; but trust not). I mean to return sometime in February, and should 
feel like one out of prison could I leave to-morrow. I hope you will visit my family as often as you can during my absence, and that you 
will write us often while here. We will endeavor, one of us, to reply promptly at least. We are getting along with our business slowly, 
but prudently, I trust, and as well as we could reasonably expect under all the circumstances ; and so far as we can discover, we are 
in favor with this people, and also with the many we have had to do business with. I sent home a good supply of excellent cloth for 
pantaloons, from which you can have some if it suits you, and should arrive safe. If it does not, please write me without delay. Jason 
took the cloth with him (cost eighty-five cents per yard). I can bring more cloth of almost any kind when I return, should there be need. 
</p><p>
When I think how very little influence I have even tried to use with my numerous acquaintances and friends, in turning their minds 
toward God and heaven, I feel justly condemned as a most wicked and slothful servant ; and the more so, as I have very seldom had 
any one refuse to listen when I earnestly called him to hear. I sometimes have dreadful reflections about having fled to go down to Tarshish. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours,

</p><p>
DEAR FATHER, Your very kind as well as rational letter I received last evening. I trust I do in some measure realize that only 
a few, a very few, years will of necessity bring to me a literal accomplishment of the sayings of the Preacher. I am quite sensible of the 
truth of your remark, that my family are quite as well off as though we possessed millions. I hope we may not be left to a feeling of 
ingratitude, or greediness of gain ; and I feel unconscious of a desire to become rich. I hope my motive for exerting myself is higher. 
I feel no inclination to move my family to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a> on account of any change that I am itching for, and think it very doubtful whether 
I ever conclude on it as the best course. My only motive would be to have them with me, if I continue in my present business, which I 
am by no means attached to. I seem to get along middling well, and hope to return in a short time. Wrote Jeremiah some days since. 
I shall pay ten cents very cheerfully to hear that you are alive and well, at any time j and should not grudge to pay more for such kind 
and ever seasonable pointing me to the absolute vanity of this world's treasures, as well as the solemn future which is before me. It affords 
me great satisfaction to get a letter from you at this period of your life, so handsomely written, so well worded, and so exactly in point, 
both as to manner and (what is much more) matter. I intend to preserve it carefully.

DEAR FATHER, After some three or four days delay on the road, we arrived here safe to-day about noun, and found all here well; 
but our hard hearts are never thankful as they should be. Always dependent and constantly receiving, we arc ungrateful enough to be 
cast off, if that were our only fault! Our business, so far as I can judge, has gone along middling well during my absence. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a> is 
not yet very stout, but is perhaps a little improved since I left. We shall all be anxious to hear from Lucian, and from you all, and how

DEAR FATHER, Yours of the 9th November was received a few 
days since, but I have delayed writing on two accounts since receiving 
it. One is the greater press of business, and increased anxiety on 
account of the sudden change in money matters j the other, that it is 
always hard for me to make out a letter without something to make it 
out of. We have been middling well since I returned, except John 
and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a>. John has had a short turn of fever, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a> has 
seemed to have a number of complaints, but both are better now. Our 
business seems to be going on middling well, and will not probably 
be any the worse for the pinch in the money concerns. I trust that 
getting or losing money does not entirely engross our attention ; but 
T am sensible that it occupies quite too large a share in it. To get a 
little property together to leave, as the world have done, is really 
a low mark to be tiring at through life. 
</p><p>
" A nobler toil may I sustain, 
A nobler satisfaction gain." 
</p><p>
You wrote us that Lucian seemed to decline. This is not unexpected ; but we hope that a life still lengthened may not all be misspent, and that the little of duty to God and mankind it may yet be 
in his power to do may be done with his might, and that the Lord Jesus Christ will be the end of the law for righteousness, for that 
which must be left undone. This is the only hope for us bankrupts, as we may see at once if we will but look at our account. We hope 
to hear how you all are again soon.

DEAR FATHER, It is Sabbath evening ; and as I have waited 
now a long time expecting a letter from you, I have concluded to 
wait no longer for you to write to me. I received the Hudson paper 
giving an account of the death of another of our family. I expected 
to get a letter from you, and so have been waiting ever since getting 
the paper. I never seemed to possess a faculty to console and com 
fort my friends in their .grief; I am inclined, like the poor comforters 
of Job, to sit down in silence, lest in my miserable way I should only 
add to their grief. Another feeling that I have in your case, is an 
entire consciousness that I can bring before your mind no new source 
of consolation, nor mention any which, I trust, you have not long 
since made full proof of. I need not say that I know how to sympathize with you j for that you equally well understand. I will only 
utter one word of humble confidence, " Though He slay me, yet 
will I trust in Jlim, and bless His name forever." We are all in 
health here, but have just been taking another lesson on the uncertainty of all we hold here. One week ago yesterday, Oliver found 
some root of the plant called hemlock, that he supposed was carrot, 
and eat some of it. In a few minutes he was taken with vomiting 
and dreadful convulsions, and soon became senseless. However, bj 
resorting to the most powerful emetics he was recovered from it, like 
one raised from the dead, almost. 
</p><p>
The country in this direction has been suffering one of the severest money pressures known for many years. The consequence to us 
has been, that some of those who have contracted for wool of us are 
as yet unable to pay for and take the wool as they agreed, and we 
are on that account unable to close our business. This, with some 
trouble and perplexity, is the greatest injury we have suffered by it. 
We have had no winter as yet scarcely, the weather to-day being 
almost as warm as summer. We want to hear how you all are very 
much, and all about how you get along. I hope to visit you in the 
spring. Farewell. 
</p><p>
Your affectionate, unworthy son,

DEAR FATHER, I write you at this time more because you 
said in your last that you u love letters more now than ever before," 
than on account of anything I have to write. W are here all middling well, except our youngest child, who has been quite feeble since 
last fall. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met"><a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met">Owen's</a></a> arm seems to be improving slowly. We have 
been selling wool middling fast of late, on contract, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a> prices. 
We have in this part of the country the strongest proofs that the great 
majority have made gold their hope, their only hope. I think that 
almost every product of industry will soon become high, from the 
fact alone that such a vast number of those who have hitherto been 
producers will cease to be so, and hereafter, for a time at least, be 
only consumers. I am inclined to think that persons who are in 
debt, and who hold any property of value, are likely to have a most 
favorable time to get out of debt. Would it not be well to have 
the word go round amongst all the Browns, that they may get ready 
to sell off enough of something to pay all debts? I really wish that 
Oliver and Frederick 1 would take the hint, and when things get up 
(which I feel confident they will do), go at once to selling off and 
paying up. There is no way of making money so easy as by selling 
when every one wants to buy. It may cost us some little sacrifice of 
feeling at first, but would open a new world almost, if thoroughly 
done. 
</p><p>
I have felt a good deal of anxiety about the injury you received 
on your way home ; was glad to hear that you was in any measure 
comfortable. I did not intend to put off writing so long j but I al 
ways find it exceedingly hard work to write when I have nothing to 
communicate that is worth as much as the paper and postage. Your 
letters are not of so barren a character ; so that we shall not expect 
you to pay the postage when you write, which we hope will be often. 
Your affectionate but unworthy son,

DEAR BROTHER, I arrived at home without any mishap on 
Saturday of the week I left you, and found all well. I had received 
newspapers from Thibodeauxville during my absence, similar to those 
sent to father, but no letters respecting the death of our brother. I 
believe I was to write father as soon as I returned, but I have 
nothing further to write, and you can show him this. I will immediately let him know what answer I get to the letter I shall send to 
the South by this mail, respecting our dear brother. 
</p><p>
I enclose fifteen dollars, and wish you to let me know that you receive it. Destroy my note, and accept my thanks. If you afford 
my colt plenty of good pasture, hay, and salt, it is all I wish, unless 
he should fall away badly or be sick. Your's bore his journey well. 
Please tell Milton Lusk that I wish to have him pay over the money 
I left with him to Julian, without delay. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>

DEAR BROTHER, As I have had only one letter from Hudson since you left here, and that some weeks since, I begin to get uneasy 
and apprehensive that all is not well. I had satisfied my mind about it for some time, in expectation of seeing father here, but I begin to 
give that up for the present. Since you left me I have been trying to devise some means whereby I might do something in a practical 
way for my poor fellow-men who are in bondage, and having fully consulted the feelings of my wife and my three boys, we have agreed 
to get at least one negro boy or youth, and bring him up as we do our own, viz., give him a good English education, learn him what we 
can about the history of the world, about business, about general subjects, and, above all, try to teach him the fear of God. We think 
of three ways to obtain one : First, to try to get some Christian slave holder to release one to us. Second, to got a free one if no one will 
let us have one that is a slave. Third, if that does not succeed, we have all agreed to submit to considerable privation in order to buy 
one. This we are now using means in order to effect, in the confident expectation that God is about to bring them all out of the house of bondage. 
</p><p>
I will just mention that when this subject was first introduced, 
Jason had gone to bed j but no sooner did he hear the thing hinted, 
than his warm heart kindled, and he turned out to have a part in the 
discussion of a subject of such exceeding interest. I have for years 
been trying to devise some way to get a school a-going here for 
blacks, and I think that on many accounts it would be a most favor 
able location. Children here would have no intercourse with vicious 
people of their own kind, nor with openly vicious persons of any 
kind. There would be no powerful opposition influence against 
such a thing ; and should there be any, I believe the settlement might 
be so effected in future as to have almost the whole influence of the 
place in favor of such a school. Write me how you would like to 
join me, and try to get on from Hudson and thereabouts some first- 
rate abolitionist families with you. I do honestly believe that our 
united exertions alone might soon, with the good hand of our God 
upon us, effect it all. 
</p><p>
This has been with me a favorite theme of reflection for years. I 
think that a place which might be in some measure settled with a 
view to such an object would be much more favorable to such an 
undertaking than would any such place as Hudson, with all its conflicting interests and feelings ; and I do think such advantages ought 
to be afforded the young blacks, whether they are all to be immediately set free or not. Perhaps we might, under God, in that way 
do more towards breaking their yoke effectually than in any other. 
If the young blacks of our country could once become enlightened, it 
would most assuredly operate on slavery like firing powder confined 
in rock, and all slaveholders know it well. Witness their heaven- 
daring laws against teaching blacks. If once the Christians in the 
free States would set to work in earnest in teaching the blacks, the 
people of the slaveholding States would find themselves constitutionally driven to set about the work of emancipation immediately. 
The laws of this State are now such that the inhabitants of any 
township may raise by a tax in aid of the State school-fund any 
amount of money they may choose by a vote, for the purpose of 
common schools, which any child may have access to by application. 
If you will join me in this undertaking, I will make with you any 
arrangement of our temporal concerns that shall be fair. Our health 
is good, and our prospects about business rather brightening. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
DEAR SON JOHN, Your letter of the 21st instant was received 
yesterday, and as I may be somewhat more lengthy than usual I begin 
my answer at once. The family have enjoyed as good health as 
usual since I wrote before, but my own health has been poor since in May. Father has had a short turn of fever and ague; Jason and 
Ellen have had a good deal of it, and were not very stout on Sunday 
last. The wheat crop has been rather light in this quarter; first 
crop of grass light ; oats very poor ; corn and potatoes promise well, 
and frequent rains have given the late grass a fine start. There has 
been some very fatal sickness about, but the season so far has been 
middling healthy. Our sheep and cattle have done well; have raised 
five hundred and fifty lambs, and expect about eighty cents per pound 
for our wool. We shall be glad to have a visit from you about the 
time of our county fair, but I do not yet know at what time it comes. 
Got a letter from Henry dated the 16th of August ; all there well. 
Grain crops there very good. We are preparing (in our minds, at 
least) to go back next spring. Mrs. Perkins was confined yesterday 
with another boy, it being her eleventh child. The understanding 
between the two families continues much as formerly, so far as I 
know. ., . 
</p><p>
In Talmadge there has been for some time an unusual seriousness 
and attention to future interests. In your letter you appear rather 
disposed to sermonize ; and how will it operate on you and Wealthy 
if I should pattern after you a little, and also quote some from the 
Bible? In choosing my texts, and in quoting from the Bible, I per 
haps select the very portions which u another portion" of my family 
hold are not to be wholly received as true. I forgot to say that my 
younger sons (as is common in this " progressive age ") appear to 
be a little in advance of my older, and have thrown off the old 
shackles entirely; after THOROUGH AND CANDID investigation they 
have discovered the Bible to be ALL a fiction! Shall I add, that 
a letter received from you some time since gave me little else than 
pain and sorrow? " The righteous shall hold on his way; " " By 
and by he is offended." 
</p><p>
My object at this time is to recall your particular attention to the 
fact that the earliest, as well as all other, writers of the Bible seem 
to have been impressed with such ideas of the character of the religion 
they taught, as led them to apprehend a want of steadfastness among 
those who might profess to adhere to it (no matter what may have 
been the motives of the different writers). Accordingly we find the 
writer of the first five books putting into the mouth of his Moses expressions like the following, and they all appear to dwell much on 
the idea of two distinct classes among their reputed disciples; namely, 
a genuine and a spurious class : 
</p><p>
" Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or 
tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord our God, to 
serve the gods of these nations ; lest there should be among you a 
root that beareth gall and wormwood." " Then men shall say, because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord God of their 
fathers." " But if thine heart turn away so that thou wilt not hear, 
but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them." 
" Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it to the children of Israel ; put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness 
for me against the children of Israel." " For I know that after my 
death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way 
which I have commanded you." " They have corrupted themselves, 
their spot is not the spot of his children." " Of the Rock that begat 
thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee." 
"-Oh, that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would 
consider their latter end! " 
</p><p>
The writer here makes his Moses to dwell on this point with a 
most remarkable solicitude, a most heart- moving earnestness. The 
writer of the next book makes his Joshua to plead with Israel with 
the same earnestness. a Choose you this day whom you will serve." 
" Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the 
Lord, to serve him." The writer of the book called Judges uses 
strong language in regard to the same disposition in Israel to back 
slide : " And it came to pass when the judge was dead, that they 
returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers; they 
ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way." 
The writer of the book Ruth makes Naomi say to Orpah, " Thy 
sister-in-law is gone back unto her people and unto jaer gods." The 
writer of the books called Samuel represents Saul as one of the same 
spurious class. Samuel is made to say to him, " Behold, to obey is 
better than sacrifice; and to hearken, than the fat of rams," clearly 
intimating that all service that did not flow from an obedient spirit 
and an honest heart would be of no avail. He makes his Saul turn 
out faithless and treacherous in the end, and finally consult a woman 
" having a familiar spirit," near the close of his sad career. The 
same writer introduces Ahitophel as one whose counsel " was as if 
a man had inquired at the oracle of God; " a writer of the Psalms 
makes David say of him, " We took sweet counsel together, and 
walked to the house of God in company ; " but he is left advising the 
son of David to incest publicly, and soon after hangs himself. The 
spot of those men seems not to be genuine. 
</p><p>
One distinguishing mark of unsoundness with all the Old Testament writers was aversion to the character of the God whom Moses 
declares in his books, and by whose direction all the so-called prophets affirmed that they spoke and wrote. The writer of the books 
called Kings says of Solomon: u And the Lord was angry with 
Solomon, because his heart was turned away from the Lord God of 
Israel; which had appeared to him twice." The same writer makes Elijah inquire of Israel : " How long halt ye between two opinions? 
If the Lord be God, follow him ; but if Baal, then follow him." He 
makes Elijah pray thus: " Hear me, O Lord! hear me, that this 
people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou hast 
turned their heart back again." The same writer makes God say 
to Elijah, " Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the 
knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath 
not kissed him." The same writer makes John say, " Come with 
me and see my zeal for the Lord; * but says of him afterward, " But 
John took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel with 
H!! his heart." This writer also says of Josiah, " And like unto him 
there was no king before him, that turned to the Lord with all his 
heart and with all his soul and with all his might, according to all 
the law of Moses ; neither after him arose there any like him." The 
writer of the book called Chronicles says of Judah, in a time of most 
remarkable reformation: "And they sware unto the Lord with a 
loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets ; 
And all Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their 
heart, and sought him with their whole desire, and he was found of 
them, and the Lord gave them rest round about." Those who wrote 
the books called Ezra and Neherniah notice the same distinguishing 
marks of character. 
</p><p>
The writer of the book called Job, makes God to say of him : 
" There is none like him in the earth; a perfect and an upright man, 
one who feareth God and escheweth evil, and still he holdeth fast his 
integrity." The same writer makes Eliphaz put to Job these questions, remarkable, but searching: " Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways? " This writer 
makes his different characters call the unstable and unsound, hypocrites. Bildad says, " So are the paths of all that forget God, and 
the hypocrite's hope shall perish. Whose hope shall be cut off, and 
whose trust shall be a spider's web. Zbphar says of the same class 
of persons, tl And their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost." 
Eliphaz says, "Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity, for 
vanity shall be his recompense." Job says, "I know that my Re 
deemer liveth, whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes behold, 
and not another." Zophar says, u The triumphing of the wicked is 
short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment." Job is made 
to inquire concerning those who deceive themselves (as though the 
thing had come to be well understood in his day) : " Will he de 
light himself in the Almighty? Will he always call upon God? " 
One writer of the Psalms says of those who did not love Israel's God, 
" Through the pride of his countenance he will not seek after God. 
God is not in all his thoughts." 
</p><p>
A writer of the Psalms, in view of the* different feelings of men 
toward the God of the Bible, has this language : " With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful, with an upright man thou wilt 
show thyself upright, with the pure, thou wilt show thyself pure, and 
with the froward thou wilt show thyself froward." Again in the 
Psalms we read, " The meek shall eat and be satisfied, they shall 
praise the Lord that seek him." Again, " The meek will he guide 
in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way. 7 " All the paths 
of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and 
testimonies." lt The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, 
and he will show them his covenant." " Oh, how great is thy goodness which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee, which thou hast 
wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men! " " The 
angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and 
delivereth them." u The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants, 
and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate." ll Though 
he fall, yet he shall not be utterly cast down, for the Lord upholdeth 
him with his hand." " The law of his God is in his heart j none of 
his steps shall slide." " But the salvation of the righteous is of the 
Lord j he is their strength in the time of trouble." u Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace," 
The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing ; thou 
wilt make all his bed in his sickness." u Our heart is not turned 
back, neither have our steps declined from thy way." " They go 
from strength to strength ; every one of them in Zion appear before 
God." " Great peace have they that love thy law, and nothing shall 
offend them." "Then shall I not be ashamed when I have respect 
unto all thy commandments." " If I forget thee, Jerusalem! let 
my right hand forget her cunning." " The backslider in heart shall 
be filled with his own ways." u To the law and to the testimony! if 
they speak not according to their word, it is because there is no light 
in them." "Thus saith the Lord, What iniquity have your fathers 
found in me that they are gone far from me, and have walked after 
vanity, and have become vain? " " Turn, back-sliding children, 
saith the Lord." u But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, 
but walked in the counsels and in the imaginations of their evil 
heart, and went backward and not forward." " Yea, the stork in 
the heaven knoweth her appointed times, and the turtle and the crane 
and the swallow observe the time of their coming, but my people 
know not the judgment of the Lord. " " The heart is deceitful above 
all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?" " Thy 
prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee, and they have 
not discovered thine iniquity." " They that observe lying vanities 
forsake their own mercy." il Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God." " Forty years 
long was I grieved with this generation, and said it is a people that 
do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways." " But 
they like men have transgressed the covenant ; there have they dealt 
treacherously against me." " Many shall be purified and made white 
and tried, but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked 
shall understand, but the wise shall understand." " The preacher 
sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written was 
upright, even words of truth." "That the generation to come might 
know them, even the children which should be born, who should 
arise and declare them to their children ; that they might set their 
hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments ; and might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation ; a generation that set not their heart aright, and 
whose spirit was not steadfast with God." " Who is wise and shall 
understand these things ; prudent, and he shall know them? For the 
ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them; but the 
transgressor shall fall therein." 
</p><p>
" Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I also 
confess before my Father which is in Heaven." " And many false 
prophets shall arise, and shall deceive many ; and because iniquity 
shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold." " And blessed is he 
whosoever shall not be offended in me." " They on the rock are 
they which when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these 
have no root, and for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall 
away." " From that time many of his disciples went back, and 
walked no more with him." u He that rejecteth me, and receiveth 
not my words, hath one that judgeth him : the word that I have 
spoken, the same shall judge him at the last day." " Every branch 
in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away." " But if our gospel 
be hid, it is hid to them that are lost." " I marvel that ye are so 
soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, 
unto another gospel." u Ye did run well: who did hinder you that 
ye should not obey the truth? " " Beware lest any man spoil you 
through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after 
the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ." " For now we 
live, if ye stand fast in the Lord." " For the time will come when 
they will not endure sound doctrine." " Therefore we ought to give 
the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any 
time we should let them slip." " Let ns therefore fear lest a promise 
being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come 
short of it." "And we desire that every one of you do show the 
same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end ; that ye be 
not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises." ll Now the just shall live by faith j but if any 
man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him." u And this 
I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge 
and in all judgment, that ye may approve things that are excellent, 
that may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ. - "And 
make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned 
out of the way, but let it rather be healed." Looking diligently 
lest any man fail of the grace of God." " For it had been better for 
them not to have known the way of righteousness, than after they 
have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto 
them." " Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou 
hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art 
fallen, and repent." " Be watchful, and strengthen the things which 
remain and are ready to die, for I have not found thy works perfect 
before God." u He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in 
white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of 
life, but I will confess his name before my* Father, and before his 
angels." " Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments, 
lest he walk naked and they see his shame. Amen." " And I 
beseech you [children] to suffer the word of exhortation."

DEAR CHILDREN, It is now nearly a month since I began on another page. Since writing before, father has seemed quite well, 
but Jason, Ellen, Owen, and Frederick have all had more or less of the ague. They were as well as usual, for them, yesterday. Others 
of the family are in usual health. I did mean that my letter should go off at once, but I have not become very stout, and have a great 
deal to look after, and have had many interruptions. We have done part of our sowing, and expect to get all our corn (of which we have 
a good crop) secure from frost this day. We shall be glad to see you here at the time of our county fair, which is to be on the twelfth and thirteenth of October. 
</p><p>
I hope that through the infinite grace and mercy of God you may 
be brought to see the error of your ways, and be in earnest to turn 
many to righteousness, instead of leading astray ; and then you might 
prove a great blessing to Essex County, or to any place where your 
lot may fall. I do not feel u estranged from my children," but I 
cannot flatter them, nor "cry peace when there is no peace." My 
wife and Oliver expect to set out for Pennsylvania before long, and 
will probably call on you j but probably not until after the fair. We 
have a nice lot of chickens fattening for you, when you come. 
Your affectionate father,

The bankruptcy of John Brown, to which he alludes in 
several of his letters, and in connection with which he was 
once imprisoned in the county jail at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a>, occurred in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1842">1842</a>, and the imprisonment was in consequence of this 
affair of the Hudson farm. Among his creditors then was 
the New England Woollen Company at Kockville in Connecticut, to whose agent he gave the following agreement, 
with the letter annexed :

Whereas I, John Brown, on or about the 15th day of June, A. D.

same for my own benefit, and could not redeem it ; and whereas I 
have been legally discharged from my obligations by the laws of the 
United States, I hereby agree (in consideration of the great kindness and tenderness of said Company toward me in my calamity,

DEAR SIR, I have just received information of my final discharge 
as a bankrupt in the District Court, and I ought to be grateful that 
no one of my creditors has made any opposition to such discharge 
being given. I shall now, if my life is continued, have an opportunity of proving the sincerity of my past professions, when legally 
free to act as I choose. I am sorry to say that in consequence of the 
unforeseen expense of getting the discharge, the loss of an ox, and 
the destitute condition in which a new surrender of my effects has 
placed me, with my numerous family, I fear this year must pass 
without my effecting in the way of payment what I have encouraged 
you to expect (notwithstanding I have been generally prosperous in 
my business for the season).

DEAR SON JOHN, I well know how to appreciate the feelings of a young person among strangers, and at a distance from home j and 
no want of good feeling towards you, or interest in you, has been the reason why I have not written yon before. I have been careful 
and troubled with so much serving, that I have in a great measure neglected the one thing needful, and pretty much stopped all correspondence with heaven. My worldly business has borne heavily, and still does j but we progress some, have our sheep sheared, and have 
done something at our haying. Have our tanning business going on 
in about the same proportion, that is, we are pretty fairly behind 
in business, and feel that I must nearly or quite give up one or other 
of the branches, for want of regular troops on whom to depend. We 
should like to know how you expect to dispose of your time hereafter, 
and how you get along, what your studies are, and what difficulties 
you meet. I would send you some money, but I have not yet received a dollar from any source since you left. I should not be so dry 
of funds could I but overtake my work ; but all is well, all is well. 
Will you come home or not this fall? I suppose there are some per 
sons in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richfield" rel="city">Richfield</a> who would be middling fond of seeing you back once

DEAR SON JOHN, Your letter, dated December 21, was received some days ago, bat I have purposely delayed till now, in 
order to comply with your request that I should write about every 
thing. We are all in health ; amongst the number is a new sister, 1 
about three weeks old. I know of no one of our friends that is not in 
comfortable health. I have just met with father ; he was with us a 
few days since, and all were then well in Hudson. Our flock is well, 
and we seem to be overtaking our business in the tannery. Divine 
Providence seems to smile on our works at tliis time ; I hope we 
shall not prove unthankful for any favor, nor forget the giveix (I 
have gone to sleep a great many times while writing the above.) 
The boys and Ruth are trying to improve some this winter, and are 
effecting a little I think. I have lately entered into a copartnership 
with Simon Perkins, Jr., of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a>, with a view to carry on the 
sheep business extensively. He is to furnish all the feed and shelter 
for wintering, as a set-off against our taking all the care of the flock. 
All other expenses we are to share equally, and to divide the profits 
equally. This arrangement will reduce our cash rents at least $250 
yearly, and save our hiring help in haying. We expect to keep the 
Captain Oviatt farm for pasturing, but my family will go into a very 
good house belonging to Mr. Perkins, say from a half a mile to a 
mile out of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a>. I think this is the most comfortable and the most 
favorable arrangement of my worldly concerns that I ever had, and 
calculated to afford us more leisure for improvement, by day and by 
night, than any other- I do hope that God has enabled us to make it in mercy to us, and not th at he should send leanness into our souls. 
Our time will all be at our own command, except the care of the flock. We have nothing to do with providing for them in the winter 
excepting harvesting rutabagas and potatoes. 
</p><p>
This, I think, will be considered no mean alliance for our family, and I most earnestly hope they will have wisdom given to make the 
most of it. It is certainly indorsing the poor bankrupt and his family, 
three of whom were but recently in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> jail, in a manner quite unexpected, and proves that notwithstanding we have been a company 
of u Belted Knights," our industrious and steady endeavors to maintain our integrity and our character have not been wholly overlooked. 
Mr. Perkins is perfectly advised of our poverty, and the times that have passed over us. Perhaps you may think best to have some 
connection with this business. I do not know of ANY person in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richfield" rel="city">Richfield</a> that you would be likely to be fond of hearing from in 
particular, excepting one at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> ; and if hearing from ANY person prove to be a very up-stream business, I would advise not 
to worry at present. Will you let me know how it stands between you and all parties concerned?

MY DEAR MARY, It is once more Sabbath evening, and nothing so much accords with my feelings as to spend a portion of it in con 
versing with the partner of my choice, and the sharer of my poverty, trials, discredit, and sore afflictions, as well as of what comfort and 
seeming prosperity has fallen to my lot for quite a number of years. I would you should realize that, notwithstanding I am absent in 
body, I am very much of the time present in spirit. I do not forget the firm attachment of her who has remained my fast and faithful 
affectionate friend, when others said of me, u Now that he lieth, he- shall rise up no more." ... I now feel encouraged to believe that 
my absence will not be very long. After being so much away, it seems as if I knew pretty well how to appreciate the quiet of home. 
There is a peculiar music in the word which a half-year's absence in a distant country would enable you to understand. Millions there 
are who have no such thing to lay claim to. I feel considerable regret by turns that I have lived so many years, and have in reality done so 
little to increase the amount of human happiness. I often regret that my manner is no more kind and affectionate to those I really love 
and esteem ; but I trust my friends will overlook my harsh, rough 
ways, when I cease to be in their way as an occasion of pain and unhappiness. In imagination I often see you in your room with Little 
Chick and that strange Anna. You must say to her that father means to come before long and kiss somebody. I will close by 
saying that it is iny growing resolution to endeavor to promote my own happiness by doing what I can to render those about me more 
so. If the large boys do wrong, call them alone into your room, and expostulate with them kindly, and see if you cannot reach them by a 
kind but powerful appeal to their honor. I do not claim that such a theory accords very well with my practice ; I frankly confess it does 
not j but I want your face to shine, even if my own should be dark and cloudy. You can let the family read this letter, and perhaps you 
may not feel it a great burden to answer it, and let me hear all about how you get along.

DEAR SON JOHN, I received your letter some days ago, but was 
so busy in preparing for my journey to Lowell (on which I now am) 
that I could find no time to write before. We had been waiting for 
news from you for some time, not knowing where you were, and were 
all glad of your letter. I will give a little account of things since 
you left. We moved to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> about the 10th of April ; get along 
very pleasantly with our neighbors Perkins ; find them very affable 
and kind. Have had a good deal of loss amongst our sheep from 
grub in the head. Have raised 560 lambs, and have 2,700 pounds 
of wool ; have been offered 56 cents per pound for one ton of it. 
Jason spends most of his time in Kichfield. Have not yet done 
finishing leather, but shall probably get through in .a few weeks 
after my return. The general aspect of our worldly affairs is favor 
able. Hope we do not entirely forget God. I am extremely ignorant 
at present of miscellaneous subjects. Have not been at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richfield" rel="city">Richfield</a> for 
some time, and have but a moment to write, on board a boat. I 
enclose three dollars, and would more, but may be short of expense 
money. May write you at Lowell or <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> j * may return by you.

DEAR SON JOHN, I arrived at home December 2d j had a fatiguing but I should think a prosperous journey, and brought with 
me a few choice sheep. Our wool sold by the sort, at from 24 cents to $1.20 per pound, just as we wash it on the sheep; average, about 
the same as last year, perhaps a little better. Our flock have done remarkably this winter, and are in good condition and health. We 
have lost but three by disease since sometime in the fall. Our sales of sheep (mostly bucks) since August amount to about $ 640. Since 
my return, I have been troubled considerably with my eyes. They are better now. Your letter to Ruth is received, and she is preparing to 
go with you when you come out. I have a plan to lay before you for your operations after the first of June next, and hope you will not commit yourself for a longer time until you hear it. I think we have quite as much worldly prosperity as will be likely to be a real blessing to 
us. Fred is in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richfield" rel="city">Richfield</a> for the present, with about 250 sheep and a dog under his command. He seems disposed to reading and some 
thought. Would like to have you write him there, or here perhaps would be better. Write often.

DEAR SON, I am out among the wool-growers, with a view to the next summer's operations. Left home about a week ago; all were 
then in middling health except some very hard colds. I expect to be out some three or four weeks yet, and on that account do not know as 
I shall be able to hear from you and Ruth until I get home. Hope to hear from you then. Mr. Perkins came home a day or two after you 
left, full in the faith of our plan, having completed our arrangements. Our plan seems to meet with general favor. Jason and I have talked 
of a visit to Canada on our return next fall. We would like to know more about that country. We should be glad to hear something from 
George Delamater, and to know where he is, and what he really means to be. You may, if you think best, say so to him, and tell him we 
have not forgotten him. Our unexampled success in minor affairs might be a lesson to us of what unity and perseverance might do in 
things of some importance. If you learn of any considerable wool-dealers or wool-growers, you can use the circular, and more may be 
sent if best ; of that you can judge after a little inquiry. I may write you again before I go home. Say to Ruth, to be all that to-day 
which she intends to be to-morrow.

DEAR SON JOHN, I reached Liverpool on Sabbath day ; the 26th iust., and this place the 27th at evening, a debtor to Grace for 
health and for a very pleasant and quick passage. Have called on the Messrs. Pickersgill, and find they have neither sold any wool nor 
offered any. They think that no time has been lost, and that a good sale can yet be expected. It is now the calculation to offer some 
of it at the monthly sale, September next, commencing a little before the middle of the month. I have had no time to examine any wools 
as yet, and can therefore express no opinion of my own in the matter. England is a fine country, so far as I have seen ; but nothing so very 
wonderful has yet appeared to me. Their forming and stone-masonry are very good ; cattle, generally more than middling good. 1 Horses, 
as seen at Liverpool and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, and through the fine country betwixt these places, will bear no comparison with those of our 
Northern States, as they average. I am here told that I must go to the Park to see the fine horses of England, and I suppose I must ; 
for the streets of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> and Liverpool do not exhibit half the display of fine horses as do those of our cities. But what I judge 
from more than anything is the numerous breeding mares and colts among the growers. Their hogs are generally good, and mutton-sheep are almost everywhere as fat as pork. Tell my friend Middleton and wife that England affords me plenty of roast beef and mutton of the first water, and done up in a style not to be exceeded. As I intend to write you very often I shall not be lengthy j shall 
probably add more to this sheet before I seal it. Since writing the above, I find that it will be my best way to set out at once for the 
Continent, and I expect to leave for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> this evening. So farewell for this time,* now about four o clock p. M.

DEAR SON JOHN, I have nothing new to write excepting that I am still well, and that on Monday a lot of No. 2 wool was sold 
at the auction sale, at from twenty-six to twenty-nine cents per pound. This is a bad sale, and I have withdrawn all other wools from the 
market, or public sales. Since the other wools have been withdrawn, I have discovered a much greater interest among the buyers, and I 
am in hopes to succeed better with the other wools ; but cannot say yet how it will prove on the whole. I have a great deal of stupid, 
obstinate prejudice to contend with, as well as conflicting interests, both in this country and from the United States. I can only say that 
I have exerted myself to the utmost, and that if I cannot effect a better sale of the other wools privately I shall start them back. I 
believe that not a pound of No. 2 wool was bought for the United States j and I learn that the general feeling is now that it was 
quite undersold. About one hundred and fifty bales were sold. I regret that so many bales were put up ; but it cannot be helped now, 
for after wool has been subjected to a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> examination for public sale, it is very much injured for selling again. The agent of Thirion, 
Mallard, & Co., has been looking at them to-day, and seemed highly pleased ; said he had never seen superior wools, and that he would 
see me again. We have not yet talked about price. 
</p><p>
I now think I shall begin to think of home quite in earnest at 
least in another fortnight, possibly sooner. I do not think the sale 
made a full test of the operation. .Farewell.

he left, one week since. Our meeting together was one of the most cordial and pleasant I ever experienced. He met a full history of 
our difficulties and probable losses without a frown on his countenance, or one syllable of reflection ; but, on the contrary, with words 
of comfort and encouragement. He is wholly averse to any separation of our business or interest, and gave me the fullest assurance of 
his undiminished confidence and personal regard. He expresses strong desire to have our flock of sheep remain undivided, to become 
the joint possession of our families when we have gone off the stage. Such a meeting I had not dared to expect, and I most heartily wish 
each of my family could have shared in the comfort of it. Mr. Perkins has in the whole business, from first to last, set an example 
worthy of a philosopher, or of a Christian. I am meeting with a good deal of trouble from those to whom we have over-advanced, but 
feel nerved to face any difficulty while God continues me such a partner. Expect to be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> within three or four weeks.

DEAR SON JOHN, I was disappointed in not seeing you and Wealthy l while in Ohio ; and not till within a few days did I get to

every day to see you. We have trouble : Pickersgills, McDonald, Jones, Warren, Burlington, and Patterson & Ewing, these different claims amount to some forty thousand dollars, and if lost will leave me nice and flat. This is in confidence. Mr. Perkins bears the 
trouble a great deal better than I had feared. I have been trying to collect, and am still trying. Have not yet effected a sale of our wool. 
I expect to take some of the best of my cattle to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a>. Our crops in Essex were very good this season, and expenses small.

</p><p>
DEAR SONS JOHN, JASON, FREDERICK, AND DAUGHTERS, I this moment received the letter of John and Jason of the 29th November, and feel grateful not only to learn that you are all alive and well, but also for almost everything your letters communicate. I am 
much pleased with the reflection that you are all three once more together, and all engaged in the same calling that the old patriarchs 
followed. I will say but one word more on that score, and that is taken from their history : " See that ye fall not out by the way," and 
all will be exactly right in the end. I should think matters were 
brightening a little in this direction, in regard to our claims ; but I 
have not yet been able to get any of them to a final issue. I think, 
too, that the prospect for the fine-wool business rather improves. 
What burdens me most of all is the apprehension that Mr. Perkins 
expects of me in the way of bringing matters to a close what no 
living man can possibly bring about in a short time, and that he is 
getting out of patience and becoming distrustful. If I could be with 
him in all I do, or could possibly attend to all my cares, and give him 
full explanations by letter of all my movements, I should be greatly 
relieved. He is a most noble -spirited man, to whom I feel most 
deeply indebted ; and no amount of money would atone to my feelings for the loss of confidence and cordiality on his part. If my sons, 
who are so near him, conduct wisely and faithfully and kindly in 
what they have undertaken, they will, beyond the possibility of a 
doubt, secure to themselves a full reward, if they should not be the 
means of entirely relieving a father of his burdens. 
</p><p>
I will once more repeat an idea I have often mentioned in regard 
to business life in general. A world of pleasure and of success is the 
sure and constant attendant upon early rising. It makes all the business of the day go off with a peculiar cheerfulness, while the effects of 
the contrary course are a great and constant draft upon one's vitality 
and good temper. When last at home in Essex, I spent every day 
but the first afternoon surveying or in tracing out old lost boundaries, 
about which I was very successful, working early and late, at two dol 
lars per day. This was of the utmost service to both body and mind } 
it exercised me to the full extent, and for the time being almost entirely divested my mind from its burdens, so that I returned to my 
task very greatly refreshed and invigorated. 
</p><p>
John asks me about Essex. I will say that the family there were 
living upon the bread, milk, butter, pork, chickens, potatoes, turnips, 
carrots, etc., of their own raising, and the most of them abundant in 
quantity and superior in quality. I have nowhere seen such potatoes. Essex County so abounds in hay, grain, potatoes, and rutabagas, etc., that I find unexpected difficulty in selling for cash oats 
and some other things we have to spare. Last year it was exactly 
the reverse. The weather was charming up to the 15th November, 
when I left, and never before did the country seem to hold out so many tilings to entice me to stay on its soil. Nothing but a strong sense of 
duty, obligation, and propriety would keep me from laying my bones 
to rest there ; but I shall cheerfully endeavor to make that sense my 
guide, God always helping. It is a source of the utmost comfort to 
feel that I retain a ;rann place in the sympathies, affections, and 
confidence of my own most familiar acquaintance, my family ; and 
allow me to say that a man can hardly get into difficulties too big to 
be surmounted, if he has a firm foothold at home. Eemember that. 
</p><p>
I am glad Jason has made the sales he mentions, on many accounts. 
It will relieve his immediate money wants, a thing that made me 
somewhat unhappy, as I could not at once supply them. It will 
lessen his care and the need of being gone from home, perhaps to the 
injury somewhat of the flock that lies at the foundation, and possibly 
to the injury of Mr. Perkins's feelings on that account, in some 
measure. He will certainly have less to divide his attention. I had 
felt some worried about it, and I most heartily rejoice to hear it ; for 
you may all rest assured that the old flock has been, and so long as 
we have anything to do with it will continue to be, the main root, 
either directly or indirectly. In a few short months it will afford 
another crop of wool. 
</p><p>
I am sorry for John's trouble in his throat ; I hope he will soon 
get relieved of that. I have some doubt about the cold-water practice in cases of that kind, but do not suppose a resort to medicines of 
much account. Regular out-of-door labor I believe to be one of the 
best medicines of all that God has yet provided. As to Essex, I have 
no question at all. For stock-growing and dairy business, consider 
ing its healthfulness, cheapness of price, and nearness to the two best 
markets in the Union (<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>), I do not know where 
we could go to do better. I am much refreshed by your letters, and 
until you hear from me to the contrary, shall be glad to have you 
write me here often. Last night I was up till after midnight writing 
to Mr. Perkins, and perhaps used some expressions in my rather 
cloudy state of mind that I had better not have used. I mentioned 
to him that Jason understood that he disliked his management of the 
flock somewhat, and was worried about that an&lt;X the poor hay he 
would have to feed out during the winter. I did not mean to write 
him anything offensive, and hope he will so understand me. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
I want to have you save or secure the first real prompt, fine-looking, black shepherd puppy whose ears stand erect, that you can get ; 
I do not care about his training at all, further than to have him learn to come to you when bid, to sit down and lie down when 
told, or something in the way of play. Messrs. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> & Titus, our lawyers in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, are anxious to get one for a plaything ; 
and I am well satisfied, that, should I give them one as a matter of friendship, it would be more appreciated by them, and do more to 
secure their best services in our suit with Pickersgill, than would a 
hundred dollars paid them in the way of fees. I want Jason to obtain from Mr. Perkins, or anywhere he can get them, two good junk- 
bottles, have them thoroughly cleaned, and filled with the cherry wine, being very careful not to roil it up before filling the bottles, 
providing good corks and filling them perfectly full. These I want him to pack safely in a very small strong box, which he can make, 
direct them to Perkins & Brown, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a>, Mass., and send them 
by express. We can effect something to purpose by producing unadulterated domestic wines. They will command great prices. 1 It 
is again getting late at night ; and I close by wishing every present as well as future good.

DEAR SON JOHN, Your kind letter is received. By same mail 
I also have one from Mr. Perkins in answer to one of mine, in which 
I did in no very indistinct way introduce some queries, not altogether 
unlike those your letter contained. Indeed, your letter throughout is 
so much like what has often passed through iny own mind, that were 
I not a little sceptical yet, I should conclude you had access to some 
of the knocking spirits. 2 I shall not write you very long, as I mean to write again before many days. Mr. Perkins's letter, to which I 
just alluded, appears to be written in a very kind spirit ; arid so long 
as he is right-side up, I shall by no means despond ; indeed, I think 
the fog clearing away from our matters a little. I certainly wish to 
understand, and I mean to understand, u how the land lies" before 
taking any important steps. You can assist me very much about 
being posted up ; but you will be able to get hold of the right end 
exactly by having everything done up first-rate, and by becoming 
very familiar, and not by keeping distant. I most earnestly hope 
that should I lose caste, my family will at least prove themselves 
worthy of respect and confidence ; and I am sure that my three sons 
in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> can do a great job for themselves and for the family if 
they behave themselves wisely. Your letter so well expresses my 
own feelings, that were it^ not for one expression I would mail it 
with one I have just finished, to Mr. Perkins. Can you not all 
three effectually secure the name of good business men this winter? 
That you are considered honest and rather intelligent I have no 
doubt. 
</p><p>
I do not believe the losses of our firm will in the end prove so very 
severe, if Mr. Perkins can only be kept resolute and patient in regard 
to matters. I have often made mistakes by being too hasty, and 
mean hereafter to u ponder well the path of my feet." I mean to 
pursue in all things such a course as is in reality wise, and as will in 
the end give to myself and family the least possible cause for regret. 
I believe Mr. Newton is properly authorized to take testimony. If 
so, I wish you to ascertain the fact and write me ; if not, I want you 
to learn through Mr. Perkins who would be a suitable person for that 
business, as I expect before many weeks to want your testimony, 
and I want you to give me the name. I forgot to write to Mr. Perkins about it, and have sealed up my letter to him. I mentioned 
about your testimony, but forgot what I should have written.

DEAR SON JOHN, Yours, dated November 14, came on in season, but an increased amount of cares has prevented me from answering 
sooner. One serious difficulty has been with Frederick, who has been very wild again. He is again, however, to all appearance 
nearly recovered from it by the return to an abstemious course of 
living, almost, if not quite, the only means used. He had gradually slid back into his old habit of indulgence in eating, the effect of 
which I consider as being now fully demonstrated. I now expect to set out for Troy on Wednesday of this week, at furthest ; and if you 
do not see me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vernon" rel="city">Vernon</a> before the stage leaves on Thursday, I wish you to take it on that day, so as to meet me-at Bonnet's Temperance 
House in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=buffalo" rel="city">Buffalo</a>. The going is too bad to go by private conveyance, and I am yet at a loss how I can get through from Warren 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vernon" rel="city">Vernon</a> with my trunk of books, etc. I intend to bring my watch with me. I have accomplished a good deal in the way of 
preparation for winter, but shall be obliged to leave a great deal undone. If you do not find me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=buffalo" rel="city">Buffalo</a> (or before you get there), 
you may wait there not longer than till Saturday evening, and then take the cars for Troy. You will learn at Bennet's whether I am 
behind or not. If you have not funds sufficient to take you to Troy, you can probably borrow a little, to be refunded immediately when I see you, by Perkins & Brown.

DEAR SIR, I called on Messrs. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> & Titus to-day. Found 
Mr. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> intended to charge us three hundred dollars as a balance of accounts. I asked him for the principal items of his charge, 
which he promised to make up, and leave, directed to you, care of 
Messrs. Delano, Dunlevy, & Co., 39 Wall Street. He said he could 
not make it up without keeping me detained over night. As I could 
see no advantage to be derived from waiting, after hearing his expla 
nation of the matter, I concluded not to wait. He says he drew an 
amended bill after drawing the first complaint, and that he gave 
more time to that than he did to the complaint. Since I left him I 
have thought this was not quite right, after the conversation we had 
with him together, and after our letter to them dated May 16, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1851">1851</a>. 
He said to me that if I was not satisfied with the charge it should be 
reduced. I did not tell him what I thought ; but if I had thought 
of our letter at the time I should have asked him to refer to it, as 
I think he went contrary to his own advice, and also to our last 
instructions. If you call on him, I wish you would ask him to read that letter to you. I think it can do no harm, and that he will probably abate something from his charge. I should not now, after reflecting upon it, hesitate to say that I think he ought to do it (and 
since looking up the copy of our letter to them). In haste, 
</p><p>
Your friend, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">JOHN BROWN</a>.

DEAR SON JOHN. I reached home last night, and found all well. 
I came by the Erie Railroad, and got along very well until I left 
Dunkirk. Fare from Dunkirk to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a>, $8.90 ; expenses from 
same to same, $4.02, and was two and a half entire days getting 
through, the roads being vastly worse than when we went out. Had 
I expected so hard and so expensive a trip, I should not have re 
turned. I mean to go back by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburg" rel="city">Pittsburg</a>h and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, there 
being on that route but twenty-eight miles of sleighing, from Troy to 
Hudson, and that on a good road. I intend to get back to Troy by 
the 17th if I can. Have not yet seen Mr. Perkins, to have any conversation with him of any account. Whatever you may do in the 
preparation of papers will be all well for the Burlington case. You 
will have saved a great amount of exposure, hardship, and expense by 
staying behind.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vernon" rel="city">Vernon</a>; but if he does not get on, or send you money in time, do 
not on any account delay setting out, if you have to borrow the 
money for a few days. The money will be sent, and if it does not 
reach you in time, Wealthy l can use it to pay, should you not have 
it on hand. Mr. Beebe has got home from Europe, which we think

DEAR SON JOHN, I learn by brother Jeremiah, who has just 
returned, that you have engaged yourself to buy wool. I have no 
objection to your doing so ; but an untiring anxiety for your welfare 
naturally inclines me to remind you of some of the temptations to 
which you may be exposed, as well as some of the difficulties you 
may meet with. Wool-buyers generally accuse each other of being 
unscrupulous liars; and in that one thing perhaps they are not so. 
Again, there are but very few persons who need money, that can 
wholly resist the temptation of feeling too rich, while handling any considerable amount of other people's money. They are also liable to 
devote God's blessed Sabbath to conversation or contrivances for furthering their schemes, if not to the examination and purchase of wool. 
Now, I would not have you barter away your conscience or good nam6 
for a commission. You will find that many will pile away their wool, 
putting the best outside, and will be entirely unwilling you should 
handle it all. I would at once leave such lots, unless that point is 
yielded. I would have an absolute limit of prices on the different 
grades. You can throw into different grades, pretty fast, a lot of wool, 
so as to see pretty nearly whether it will average above or below the 
grade you wish generally to buy. Do not let your anxiety to buy carry 
you one inch beyond your judgment. Do not be influenced a particle 
by what you hear others have offered. Never make, an absolute offer 
to any one for Ms wool. If persons will not set a price on it, which you 
feel confident you are authorized to pay, you can ask them if they will 
not take so much, without really making any bid. If you make bids, 
some other buyer will follow you, and get the wool by offering a 
trifle more. A very trifling difference will very often do as much 
towards satisfying persons as would a greater one. You will generally buy to the best advantage where the wool is generally good and 
washed: you can buy to better advantage by finding a good stand, 
and there buying no more than you have the funds on hand to pay 
for. Do not agree to pay money you have not on hand. Remember 
that. Say who you are employed to buy for frankly if asked. The 
less you have to say about the why or wherefore the better, other 
than that you are limited. A book containing the grading of numerous lots of wool is with me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a>, to which you can have access ; 
it may be of service to you about knowing how different lots will 
average. Buy you a superior cow, one that you have milked your 
self, and know to give a good quantity of milk, before getting a 
horse. The getting of a horse will get for you numerous absolute 
wants you would otherwise not have. All well. Shall want to know 
where to find you.

DEAR SON JOHN, I got here last night, and found all very comfortable and well, except Henry, who is troubled with a lame back, 
something like rheumatism I presume. The weather has been very 
mild so far, and things appear to be progressing among our old 
neighbors ; so that I feel as much as ever disposed to regard this as 
my home, and I can think of no objection to your coming here to live 
when you can sell out well. A middling good saw- mill is now running a few rods down the river 1 from the large pine log we used to 
cross on, when we went to help Henry take care of his oats. The 
more I reflect on all the consequences likely to follow, the more I am 
disposed to encourage you to come here j and I take into the account 
as well as I can the present and future welfare of yourself and 
family, and prospects of usefulness. Our trial at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> is to come

DEAR WIFE, ... Since leaving home I have thought that under 
all the circumstances of doubt attending the time of our removal, and 
the possibility that we may not remove at all, I had perhaps encouraged the boys to feed out the potatoes too freely. ... I want 
to have them very careful to have no hay or straw wasted, but I 
would have them use enough straw for bedding the cattle to keep 
them from lying in the mire. I heard from Ohio a few days since ; 
all were then well. It now seems that the Fugitive Slave Law was 
to be the means of making more Abolitionists than all the lectures we have had for years. It really looks as if God had his hand on 
this wickedness also. I of course keep encouraging my colored 
friends to u trust in God, and keep their powder dry." I did so 
to-day, at Thanksgiving meeting, publicly. . . . While here, and at 
almost all places where 1 stoy, I am treated with all kindness and 
attention ; hut it does not make home. I feel lonely and restless, no 
matter how neat and comfortable my room and bed, nor how richly 
loaded may be the table ; they have few charms for me, away from 
home. I can look back to our log-cabin at the centre of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richfield" rel="city">Richfield</a>, 
with a supper of porridge and johnny-cake, as a place of far more 
interest to me than the " Massasoit " l of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a>. But "there's

oblige me by paying in oats at forty cents per bushel, or in board as 
above, whichever he may choose. When you can sell my stuff please 
pay your father $2.00 for me. I also wish you to send on of my shingles that Hiram Brown carried out, two thousand to Alva Holt, as 
we settled about the oats on condition of my sending him two thou 
sand. I wish you to open an account of debt and credit with me from 
this time on, as I shall have a good many errands to trouble you 
with. I wish you would notify Mr. Flanders by letter at once (if Nash calls on you for the $3.00) to go ahead with the suit. Mr. 
Kellogg told me he thought the Trustees would settle with me, were 
he to write to them. We are getting along very well ; the boys are 
still ahead, and Jack is with us. Mr. Blood talked of taking the 
shingles before I sold the two thousand to Holt, and said he would 
go and look at them, and give me $1.50 per thousand for them if he 
liked them. I wish to do the handsome thing by him about it. 
Would be glad to have you see him about it. My love unceasing

this to be attended to before the snow covers them up again.

DEAR HENRY, Mr. Judd is wanting to buy a large quantity of

I have thought a good deal how to arrange as well as possible in 
regard to a home, should I live to go back to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=north elba" rel="city">North Elba</a>,. I am a 
good deal at a loss how to divide the land so as to accommodate both 
families in the best way ; and I wish to call your attention to that 
matter, as you may perhaps be able to think of some way that will 
exactly suit all hands. I would be glad if Henry will send me his 
views freely in regard to the following questions, namely : Are you 
fond of the business or care of a sawmill f Are there any springs on 
that part of the lot lying east of the river, so situated as to accommo 
date a family on that side ; or do you think there is a prospect of 
getting a good well where the strip is of some width, and the face 
such as would be convenient to build on? Would you divide the 
land by the river, or by a line running east and west? Will it be 
any damage to you if you defer building your house until we can hit 
on some plan of dividing the land, or at least for another year? If I 
was sure of going back next spring I should want to get some logs 
peeled for a house, as I expect to be quite satisfied with a log-house 
for the rest of my days. Perhaps by looking over the land a little 
with a view to these things, you can devise a plan that will suit well. 
I do not mean to be hard to please j but such is the situation of the 
lot, and so limited are my means, that I am quite at a loss. Will it 
be convenient to have the ground that is gone over on the east side 
of the river got into grass this season? . . . I can think of but little 
to write that will be worth reading. Wishing you all present and 
future good, I remain,

DEAR CHILDREN, Your very welcome letters were received last night. In regard to a house, I did not prefer a log one, only in view 
of the expense ; and I would wish Henry to act according to his own 
best judgment in regard to it. If he builds a better house than I can 
pay for, we must so divide the land as to have him keep it. I would 
like to have a house to go into next spring, if it can be brought about 
comfortably. I ought to have expressed it more distinctly in better 
season, but forgot to do so. We are in comfortable health, so far as 
I know, except father, Jason, and Ellen, all of whom have had a run 
of ague. Father, when I saw him last, was very feeble ; and I fear 
that in consequence of his great age he will never get strong again. 
It is some days since I went to see him. We are not through sheep- 
shearing or hoeing, and our grass is needing to be cut now. We have 
lately had very dry weather. ... I am much rejoiced at the news 
of a religious kind in Ruth's letter ; and would be still more rejoiced 
to learn that all the sects who bear the Christian name would have 
no more to do with that mother of all abominations, man-stealing. 
I hope, unfit and unworthy as I am, to be allowed a membership in 
your little church before long ; and I pray God to claim it as his own, 
and that he will most abundantly bless all in your place who love him 
in truth. u If any man love not his brother whom he hath seen, how 
can he love God whom he hath not seen? " I feel but little force 
about me for writing or any kind of business, but will try to write 
you more before long. Our State fair commences at Dayton the 20th 
of September, and will be held open four days.

DEAR CHILDREN, I did not get Ruth's letter, dated on the 1st 
instant, until the 12th, but was very glad to hear from you then, and 
to learn that you found things as well as you did. In fact, God 
never leaves us without the mst abundant cause for gratitude ; and 
let us try and have it in habitual exercise. We have had some com 
plaints among several of us of late, but none of us have been very 
unwell. We had a most comfortable settlement of last year's business with Mr. Perkins, and division of stock. I had nine of the 
company calves, and he sold me four of the old for one hundred dollars, which I used to have. I have two young bull calves, one a 
full blood, which I think among the best I ever saw.

</p><p>
MY DEAR FRIEND, Your most welcome letter of the 14th hist., 
from Au Sable Forks, is received. I cannot express the gratitude I 
feel to all the kind friends who contributed towards paying for the 
place at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=north elba" rel="city">North Elba</a>,, after I had bought it, as I am thereby relieved 
from a very great embarrassment both with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Mr. Smith</a> and the young 
Thompsons, and also comforted with the feeling that my noble-hearted 
wife and daughters will not be driven either to beg or become a bur 
den to my poor boys, who have nothing but their hands to begin with. 
I am under special obligation to you for going to look after them and 
cheer them in their homely condition. May God reward you all a 
thousandfold! No language I have can express the satisfaction it 
affords me to feel that I have friends who will take the trouble to look 
after them and know the real condition of my family, while I am " far 
away," perhaps never to return. I am still waiting here for company, 
additional teams, and means of paying expenses, or to know that I can 
make a diversion in favor of our friends, in case they are involved 
again in trouble. Colonel Forbes has come on and has a small 
school at Tabor. I wrote you some days ago, giving a few particulars in regard to our movements; and I intend writing my friend <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ges" rel="friend colleague met">Stearns</a>, as soon as I have anything to tell him that is worth a stamp. Please say to him, that, provided I do not get into such a 
speculation as shall swallow up all the property I have been furnished with, I intend to keep it all safe, so that he may be remunerated in 
the end ; but that I am wholly in the dark about it as yet, and that I caunot flatter him much now. Will direct where to write me when 
I know how to do so.

</p><p>
DEAR WIFE, ... Since the sending off to slavery of Long 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, I have improved my leisure hours quite busily with 
colored people here, in advising them how to act, and in giving them 
all the encouragement in my power. They very much need encouragement and advice ; and some of them are so alarmed that they tell 
me they cannot sleep on account of either themselves or their wives and children. I can only say I think I have been enabled to do 
something to revive their broken spirits. I want all my family to 
imagine themselves in the same dreadful condition. My only spare 
time being taken up (often till late hours at night) in the way I 
speak of, has prevented me from the gloomy homesick feelings 
which had before so much oppressed me : not that I forget my 
family at all. 
</p><p>
Some of the advice thus given has already been copied : 
more condensed suggestions are as follows : 
</p><p>
" Collect quietly, so as to outnumber the adversaries who are taking 
an active part against you j make clean work with all such, and be 
sure you meddle not with any other. Do not delay one moment after 
you have a fair majority of your own men over those who are actually 
about the mischief. Let the collection of a fair majority be your signal to engage ; and when engaged do not do your business by halves. 
When one of you engage, let all the others fall to work without noise 
or confusion. Stand by one another and by your friends while a drop 
of blood remains, and be hanged if you must, but tell no tales out of 
school ; make no confessions. Hold 011 to your tools, and never be 
scared or persuaded, by the world combined, to part with them, or to 
leave them away from you. Do not trust them with friend or foe. 
Always keep your families advised of the places where you may be 
found when absent from home." 
</p><p>
Four or five years earlier than this, and soon after 
Brown's arrival in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a>, lie had begun to communi 
cate his purpose of attacking slavery by force to the colored 
men whom he found to be worthy of trust. In <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1846">1846</a> there 
was living in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a> (where he still resides) a fugitive 
slave from the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Thomas Thomas 
by name, whom Brown engaged to work for him as a porter 
in his wool warehouse. " How early shall I come to-morrow, 7 
said Thomas the day he was hired. " We begin work at 
seven," said Brown ; " but I wish you would come round 
earlier, so that I can talk with you." Thomas therefore 
went to his employer's the next morning between five and 
six o clock, found Brown waiting for him, and there received from him the outlines of his plan to liberate the 
slaves, and was invited to join in the enterprise, which he 
agreed to do. This was nine years before Brown went to 
Kansas, and two years before Simmer, Wilson, Adams, S. C. 
Phillips, Hoar, and their friends formed the Free Soil party 
of Massachusetts. Thomas was afterward sent by Brown to 
look up Madison Washington, the leader of the courageous 
slaves of the vessel " Creole," who was wanted as a leader 
among the colored recruits that were to join the band of 
liberators ; but Washington, when found, proved to be an 
unfit person for such a task. 
</p><p>
It is said that the first definite thought of the place where 
he should make his attack upon the slave system came to 
Brown while he was surveying lands for Oberlin College, in 
what is now West Virginia, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1840">1840</a>. These lands were, in 
part at least, in the county of Jackson, which borders on 
Ohio, and is separated from that State by the Ohio River. 
It is west of the Alleghanies, and is not very mountainous ; 
but in approaching or leaving it Brown had occasion to ob 
serve how useful those mountains would be to any band of 
men who were aiming at emancipation by force. " The 
mountains and swamps of the South," said Brown in Kansas, 
" were intended by God as a refuge far the slave, and a de 
fence against his master." That he cherished this purpose 
when he wrote the following from West Virginia, nearly 
twenty years before his foray at Harper's Ferry, is certain ; 
and the thought that he had his great project in mind then, 
gives an interest to the brief letter :

</p><p>
... I like the country as well as I expected, and its inhabitants 
rather better ; and I have seen the spot where, if it be the will of 
Providence, I hope one day to live with niy family. . . . Were 
the inhabitants as resolute and industrious as the Northern people, 
and did they understand how to manage as well, they would become 
rich j but they are not generally so. They seem to have no idea of 
improvement in their cattle, sheep, or hogs, nor to know the use of 
enclosed pasture-fields for their stock, but spend a large portion 
of their time in hunting for their cattle, sheep, and horses ; and the 
same habit continues from father to son. . . . By comparing them 
with the people of other parts of the country, I can see new and 
abundant proof that knowledge is power. I think we might be very 
useful to them on many accounts, were we so disposed. May God 
in mercy keep us all, and enable us to get wisdom ; and with all our 
getting or losing, to get understanding!

</p><p>
DEAR SON JOHN, Since I parted with you at Hudson some 
thoughts have passed through my mind which my intense anxiety 
for your welfare prompts me to communicate by writing. I think 
the situation in which you have been placed by Providence at this 
early period of your life will afford to yourself and others some little 
test of the sway you may be expected to exert over minds in after life, 
and I am glad, on the whole, to have you brought in some measure 
to the test in your youth. If you cannot now go into a disorderly 
country school and gain its confidence and esteem, and reduce it to 
good order, and waken up the energies and the very soul of every rational being in it, yes, of every mean, ill-behaved, ill-governed boy 
and girl that compose it, and secure the good- will of the parents, 
then how are you to stimulate asses to attempt a passage of the Alps? 
If you run with footmen and they should weary you, how should you 
contend with horses? If in the land of peace they have wearied you, 
then how will you do in the swelling of Jordan? Shall I answer the 
question myself? "If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, 
who giveth liberally and upbraideth not." Let me say to you again, love them all, and commend them and yourself to the God to whom 
Solomon sought in his youth, and he shall bring it to pass. You 
have heard me tell of dividing a school into two large spelling-classes, 
and of its effects ; if you should think best, and can remember the 
process, you can try it. Let the grand reason, that one course is 
right and another wrong, be kept continually before your own mind 
and before your school.

DEAR SON JOHN, Yours of the 28th April we did not get very 
seasonably, as we have been very busy, and not at the post-office 
often. We are all obliged for your letter, and I hope thankful for 
any comfort or success that may attend you. If the days of mourn 
ing have indeed and in truth ceased, then I trust all is well, all is 
well as it should be ; and I have known fair days to follow after very 
foul weather. The great trouble is, we are apt to get too damp in a 
wet, foggy spell. We are all well but little Annie, who is afflicted 
with a singular eruption of the skin, and is withal quite unwell. We 
get along in our business as well as we ever have done, I think. We 
have some sheep, but not as many as for two seasons past. Matters 
seem to go well betwixt us and our friend Perkins, and for anything 
that I know of, our worldly prospects are as good as we can bear. 
I hope that entire leanness of soul may not attend any little success 
in business. I do not know as we have yet any new plans ; when we 
have, we will let you hear. We are nearly through another yean 
ing time, and have lost but very few. Have not yet counted tails : 
think there may be about four hundred. Never had a finer or more 
thrifty lot. Expect to begin washing sheep next week. Have received our medals and diploma. They are splendid toys, and appear 
to be knock-down arguments among the sheep-growers who have 
seen them. All were well at Hudson a few days since. Father was 
here, and had just moved into the Humiston house out west. You 
did not say in your letter whether you ever conversed with him in 
regard to his plans for his old age, as was talked of when you were 
here and were helping pick sheep ; should like to know if you did, 
etc. Cannot tell you much more now, except it be that we all appear 
to think a great deal more about this world than about the next, 
which proves that we are still very foolish. I leave room for some 
others of the family to write, if they will.

</p><p>
DEAR SON AND DAUGHTER, I wrote you some time since, enclosing five dollars ; but neither of you have let me know whether 
you received it or not, nor how much you were in immediate want of. Two lines would have told me all, and that you were or were not 
well. I now enclose you ten dollars ; and I want to hear from you without one moment's delay, or I cannot till I get to New England 
(possibly). Say to me how much you must have for your bills at Austinburg and expenses back to this place. I can calculate for 
John's expenses to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a> from here, and will provide for that. I have some nice cloth for an entire suit, which I think I had better 
take for you (John) to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a>, so that you can have it made up there if you have any want of clothes before winter. We have plenty 
of it on hand, and it will save paying out the money. We are getting a good pair of calfskin boots made for you. We intend to take on a good supply of nice well-made shirts, in order to save your paying there for such things more than is indispensable, and also to prevent your being delayed after you come back here with Ruth. 
</p><p>
It is barely possible that Jason and I may come by way of Austinburg. We expect to start in a little more than a week from this. 
If I do not come by your place on my way, you may look for another letter before I start for the East. It may be that some of your bills 
can lie unpaid till I can sell some of our wool, and let you draw on Perkins & Brown at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a> for the amount, instead of making 
a remittance by mail. Some of your merchants or other business 
men might be glad to get a small draft of that kind, payable at sight. 
Let me know all about matters. All are well here.

</p><p>
DEAR MARY, ... Your letter dated the 20th was received last 
night, and afforded me a real though a mournful satisfaction. That 
you had received, or were to receive, a letter from either John or 
Jason I was in perfect ignorance of till you informed me ; and I am 
glad to learn that, wholly uninfluenced by me, they have shown a 
disposition to afford you the comfort in your deep affliction which the 
nature of the case would admit of. Nothing is scarcely equal with 
me to the satisfaction of seeing that one portion of my remaining 
family are not disposed to exclude from their sympathies and their 
warm affections another portion. I accept it as one of the most 
grateful returns that can be made to me for any care or exertion on 
my part to promote either their present or their future well-being : 
and while I am able to discover such a feeling, I feel assured that 
notwithstanding God has chastised us often and sore, yet he has not 
entirely withdrawn himself from us nor forsaken us utterly. The 
sudden and dreadful manner in which he has seen fit to call our dear 
little Kitty to take her leave of us is, I need not tell you how much, 
in my mind ; but before Him I will bow my head in submission and 
hold my peace. ... I have sailed over a somewhat stormy sea for 
nearly half a century, and have experienced enough to teach me 
thoroughly that I may most reasonably buckle up and be prepared 
for the tempest. Mary, let us try to maintain a cheerful self-command 
while we are tossing up and down ; and let our motto still be Action, 
Action, as we have but one life to live.

and correspondence. We expect now to go home, if our lives and 
health are spared, next month, and we feel rejoiced that the time is 
so near when we hope to meet you all once more. Sometimes my 
imagination follows those of my family who have passed behind the 
scenes; and I would almost rejoice to be permitted to make them a 
personal visit. I have outlived nearly half of all my numerous family, and I ought to realize that in any event a large proportion of my 
journey is travelled over. 
</p><p>
You say that you would like very much to have a letter from me, 
with as much good advice as I will give. Well, what do you sup 
pose I feel most anxious for in regard to yourself and all at home? 
Would you believe that I ever had any such care on my mind about 
them as we read that Job had about his family (not that I would 
ever think to compare myself with Job) I Would you believe that 
the long story would be that ye sin not, that you form no foolish 
attachments, and that you be not a companion of fools? 
Your affectionate father,

DEAR SON JOHN, Yours dated Feb. 27th I this day received. 
It was written about the same time I reached this place again. I 
am glad to learn that you are relieved in a good measure from another 
season of suffering. Hope you will make the right improvement of 
it. I have been here nearly two weeks. Have Captain Spencer, 
Freeman, the Hudsons, together with Schlessinger and Ramsden, all 
helping me again. Have turned about four thousand dollars worth 
of wool into cash since I returned j shall probably make it up to 
seven thousand by the 16th. Sold Musgrave the James Wallace lot 
yesterday for fifty-eight cents all round. Hope to get pretty much 
through by the middle of April. Have paid your account for the 
11 Cincinnati Weekly Herald and Philanthropist," together with two 
dollars for one year's subscription to " National Era," being in all 
three dollars. I should have directed to have the "National Era " 
sent you at Austinburg, but could not certainly know as you would 
be there to take it. You had better direct to have it sent to you 
there. I now intend to send Ruth on again soon after my return. 
Jason writes on the 3d that all are well at home. I feel better than 
when I left home, and send my health to all in and about Austinburg. 
Yours affectionately, 
</p><p>

DEAR SON JOHN, Yours of the 5th is just received. I was very 
glad to learn by it that you were then well. I had begun to feel 
anxious, not hearing for so long a time since you wrote, that you 
were unwell. My own health is middling good ; and I learn that 
all at home were well a few days since. I enclose ten dollars; and 
I must say that when you continue to make INDEFINITE applications for money, without giving me the least idea of the amount you 
need, after I have before complained of the same thing, namely, your not telling me frankly how much you need, it makes me feel 
injured. Suffice it to say that it always affords me the greatest 
pleasure to assist you when I can ; but if you want five, ten, twenty, 
or fifty dollars, why not say so, and then let me help you so far as I 
am able? It places me in an awkward fix. I am much more will 
ing to send you all you actually need (if in my power), than to send 
any when you do not tell what your wants require. 
</p><p>
I do not now see how we could make the exchange Mr. Walker 
proposes in regard to sheep, but should suppose it might be done to 
his mind somewhere in our direction. I should think your brother 
student might pay the postage of a letter ordering the " Era" to you 
at Austinburg till the year expires. I have ten times as many papers 
as I can read. Have got on middling well, since I wrote you, with 
the wool-trade, and mean to return shortly, and send Ruth to Austin- 
burg. Do not see how to take time to give you further particulars 
now, having so much every hour to attend to. Write me on receipt 
of this. Will send you a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=steubenville" rel="city">Steubenville</a> report. 
</p><p>
Affectionately your father,

DEAR SON JOHN, I wrote you yesterday to urge your coming 
here to keep up the family for a few months, as I knew of no way to 
provide for Jason or <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met">Owen's</a> board ; but that matter is all got over, 
and the probability is that Jason will have a wife as soon as you. 
We mean to have the business done up before we leave, so as to 
have no breaking up of the family here. I would now say that if 
you can get ready and meet us at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=buffalo" rel="city">Buffalo</a> on the 14th or 15th, we 
shall be glad to have you go on with us. I would be willing to 
delay for a day or more in order to bring it about. It would seem as 
though you might bring it about by that time, so early as to get here 
on the 16th, as you wrote. As matters now stand, I feel very anx 
ious to have you go on with us, and partly on Frederick's account. 
I sent you yesterday a certificate of deposit for fifty dollars, directed to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vernon" rel="city">Vernon</a>, care of Miss Wealthy Hotchkiss. 1 Should it so happen that 
you get to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=buffalo" rel="city">Buffalo</a> before we do, wait for us at Bennett's Hotel ; or 
we will wait for you awhile. Inquire for us at Bennett s, or of George 
Palmer, Esq. If you get this in season, you may perhaps get to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=buffalo" rel="city">Buffalo</a> before we can. Mary is still quite feeble. Frederick appears 
to be quite as well as when you left. Say to Ruth I remember her.

DEAR DAUGHTER RUTH, I have not heard from you since John 
left to come on here ; and I can assure you it is not for want of interest in your welfare that I have so long delayed writing you. We 
got over the tedious job of moving as \vell as we could expect, and 
have both families comfortably fixed. Frederick has been under the 
treatment of one of the most celebrated physicians in Massachusetts, 
and for some part of the time has appeared to be as well as ever, but 
has not appeared so well for a few days past. Your mother is quite 
unwell with a bilious fever, and has been so for a day or two. We 
think she is doing well now, and hope she will get around soon. 
We have almost all of us complained more or less since we got on 
here. We have heard from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> every few days since we came on. 
All were well there a short time since. 
</p><p>
Our business here seems to go on middling well, and should nothing befall me I hope to see you about the last of this month or early 
next. John says he will write you soon. I supposed he had done 
BO before this, until now. We are very busy, and suppose we are 
likely to be for the present. We expect you to write us how you get 
along, of course.

DEAR SON JOHN, I now enclose draft on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> for fifty dollars, which I think you can dispose of to some of the merchants 
for a premium at this time in the season. I shall pay you the balance as soon as I can ; but it may be out of my power until after we 
sell our wool, which I think there is a prospect now of doing early. I hope to get through here so as to be on our way again to Ohio before the week closes, but want you and Jason both to hold on and take the best possible care of the flock until I do get on, at any rate. 
I wrote you last week that the family is on the road : the boys are driving on the cattle, and my wife and the little girls are at Oneida

DEAR MARY, ... There is an unusual amount of very interesting things happening in this and other countries at present, and no one can foresee what is yet to follow. The great excitement produced by the coining of Kossuth, and the last news of a new revolution 
in France, with the prospect that all Europe will soon again be in a blaze, seems to have taken all by surprise. I have only to say in 
regard to those things, I rejoice in them, from the full belief that God 
is carrying out his eternal purpose in them all. I hope the boys 
will be particularly careful to have no waste of feed of any kind, for 
I am strongly impressed with the idea that a long, severe winter is before us.

DEAR CHILDREN, I returned here on the evening of the 19th 
inst., having left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> on the 14th, the date of your letter to John. 
I was very glad to hear from you again in that way, not having received anything from you while at home. I left all in usual health, 
and as comfortable as could be expected ; but am afflicted with you 
on account of your little boy. Hope to hear by return mail that you 
are all well. As in this trouble you are only tasting of a cup I have 
had to drink deeply, and very often, I need not tell you how fully I 
can sympathize with you in your anxiety. . . . 
</p><p>
How long we shall continue here is beyond our ability to foresee, 
but think it very probable that if you write us by return mail we 
shall get your letter. Something may possibly happen that may 
enable us (or one of us) to go and see you, but do not look for us. I 
should feel it a great privilege if I could. We seem to be getting 
along well with our business so far, but progress miserably slow. 
My journeys back and forth this winter have been very tedious. If 
you find it difficult for you to pay for Douglass paper, I wish you 
would let me know, as I know I took liberty in ordering it continued. You have been very kind in helping me, and I do not mean 
to make myself a burden.

DEAR CHILDREN, I reached home on the 18th at evening, meet

yesterday; he kept me so busied that I had no time to write you 
yesterday. I found all in usual health but Frederick, who has one 
of his poor turns again ; it is not severe, and we hope will not be so. 
I now enclose the Flanders lease. You will discover that the bar 
gain I had with him for the second year is simply an extension of the time made on the back of it, except that for the last year I was to 
pay the taxes. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met">Owen</a> says he thinks the tooth fell out of the harrow 
while lying on a pile of sticks and old boards near the corner of the 
barn, between that and the house ; and that if you do not find it 
among the rubbish, nor in the house or barn, over the door from

Expecting to hear from you again soon,

DEAR CHILDREN, I have a great deal to write, and but very 
little time in which to do it. A letter was received from you, which 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=sab" rel="child met">Salmon</a> put in his pocket before it had been opened, and lost it. This 
grieved me very much indeed j I could hardly be reconciled to it. 
We have been having the measles, and now have the whooping- 
cough among the children very bad. Your mother was confined by 
the birth of the largest and strongest boy she ever had two weeks 
ago, and has got along well considering all our difficulties. The 
little one took the measles, and was very sick, and has now the 
whooping-cough so bad that we expect to lose him ; we thought 
him dying for some time last night. Annie and Sarah cough badly ; 
Oliver is getting over it. Our little one has dark hair and eyes like 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson's</a>; notwithstanding our large number, we are very anxious to 
retain him. 
</p><p>
Jason and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met">Owen</a> have gone on to a large farm of Mr. Perkins over 
in Talmadge. Frederick is with us, and is pretty well. The family 
of Mr. Perkins have the whooping-cough, and have had the measles. 
They have another son, a few days older than ours. Our other 
friends are well, so far as we know. Father was with us, quite well, 
a few days ago. We have had so much rain that we could do but 
little towards spring crops. Have planted our potatoes. The grass 
is forward ; great prospect of apples and cherries, but no peaches 
scarcely. Have twelve of the finest calves I ever saw. Our <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=troy" rel="city">Troy</a> 
suit went in our favor, but not to the extent that it ought. I 
have bought out the interests of Jason and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met">Owen</a> in the lot we 
got of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Mr. Smith</a>, on which, I suppose, you are living before this. 
I can send you no more now than my earnest wishes for your 
good, and my request that as soon as you can you send me the 
substance of your last letter, with such additions as you may be able 
to make.

DEAR SON JOHN, I wrote you a few days before the death of 
our infant son, saying we expected to lose him ; since then we have 
some of us been sick constantly. The measles and whooping-cough 
went so hard with Sarah that we were quite anxious on her account, 
but were much more alarmed on account of my wife, who was taken 
with bleeding at the lungs two or three days after the death of her 
child. She was pretty much confined to her bed for some weeks, and 
suffered a good deal of pain, but is now much more comfortable, and 
able to be around. About the time she got about I was taken with 
fever and ague, and am unable to do much now, but have got the 
shakes stopped for the present. The almost constant wet weather 
put us back very much about our crops, and prevented our getting in 
much corn. What we have is promising. Our wheat is a very good 
quality, but the crop is quite moderate. Our grass is good, and we 
have a good deal secured. We shall probably finish harvesting 
wheat to-day. Potatoes promise well. Sheep arid cattle are doing 
well ; and I would most gladly be able to add that in wisdom and 
good morals we are all improving. The boys have done remarkably 
well about the work ; I wish I could see them manifest an equal 
regard for their future well-being. Blindness has happened to us in 
that which is of most importance. 
</p><p>
We are at a loss for a reason that we do not hear a word from you. 
The friends are well, so far as I know. Heard from Henry and Ruth 
a few days since.

DEAR SON JOHN, I had just written a short letter to you, directed and sealed it, when I got yours of the 1 st instant. I am glad 
to hear from- you again, and had been writing that I could not re 
member hearing anything from you since early last spring. I air 
pretty much laid up with the ague, and have been for more than a 
month. The family are about in their usual health. Your mother 
is not well, but is about the house at work. The other friends are 
well, so far as I know. After something of a drouth, the weather 
has become very unsteady j yet we have not had a great amount of 
rain. We get a little so often that we progress slowly with our hay 
ing, of which we have yet considerable to do; we have also some 
late oats to cut. Have our wheat secured. Our corn we had to 
plant over once ; it now looks promising. The prospect for potatoes, 
since the rains have begun to come, is good. Our sheep and cattle 
are doing well ; we think of taking some to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> to show. 
Have not heard from Henry and Ruth since June 26, when they were 
well. Mr. Ely of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> writes us that our trial there will corne on 
about the 21st September, and that we must then be ready. He says 
Mr. Beebe had not returned from Europe July 24, but is expected 
this month. We want you without fail to have your business so 
arranged that you can go on and be there by that date, as we cannot 
do without you at all. We have not yet sold our wool. I hope 
your corn and oats will recover ; ours that was blown down last year 
did in a good measure. 
</p><p>
One word in regard to the religious belief of yourself, and the ideas 
of several of my children. My affections are too deep-rooted to be 
alienated from them; but " rny gray hairs must go down in sorrow 
to the grave " unless the true God forgive their denial and rejection 
of him, and open their eyes. I am perfectly conscious that their 
eyes are blinded to the real truth, their minds prejudiced by hearts 
unreconciled to their Maker and Judge j and that they have no right 
appreciation of his true character, nor of their own. il A deceived 
heart hath turned them aside." That God in infinite mercy, for 
Christ's sake, may grant to you and Wealthy, and to my other chil 
dren, u eyes to see," is the most earnest and constant prayer of 
Your affectionate father,

DEAR RUTH, Your letter to mother and children is this day 
received. We are always glad to hear from you, and are much 
pleased with the numerous particulars your letters contain. I have 
had a return of the ague (rather severe), so that I am pretty much 
laid up, and not good for much anyway; am now using means to 
break it up again. Your mother is still more or less troubled with 
her difficulties, but is able to keep about and accomplish a good deal. 
The remainder of the family (and friends, so far as I know) are quite 
well. We are getting nearly through haying and harvest. Our hay 
crop is most abundant ; and we have lately had frequent little rains, 
which for the present relieves us from our fears of a terrible drouth. 
We are much rejoiced to learn that God in mercy has given you some 
precious showers. It is a great mercy to us that we frequently are 
made to understand most thoroughly our absolute dependence on a 
power quite above ourselves. How blessed are al] whos& hearts and 
conduct do not set them at variance with that power! Why will not 
my family endeavor to secure his favor, and to effect in the one only 
way a perfect reconciliation? 
</p><p>
The cars have been running regularly from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> 
since July 5, so that there is now steam conveyance from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=westport" rel="city">Westport</a>. This is a great comfort, as it reduces the journey to such 
a trifling affair. We are making a little preparation for the Ohio 
State Fair at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a>, on 15th, 16th, 17th September next, and 
think we shall exhibit some cattle and sheep. Mr. and Mrs. Perkins have been away at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> for about three weeks. Mr. Perkins is away for a great part of the time. We are quite obliged to our friend Mrs. Dickson for remembering us ; are glad she is with 
you, and hope you will do a little towards making her home with you 
happy on our account, as we very much respect her, and feel quite an 
interest in her welfare. 
</p><p>
Our Oliver has been speculating for some mouths past in hogs. I 
think he will probably come out about even, and maybe get the interest of his money. Frederick manages the sheep mostly, and butchers 
mutton for the two families. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a> operates on the farm. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=sab" rel="child met">Salmon</a> 
is chief captain over the cows, calves, etc., and he has them all to 
shine. Jason and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met">Owen</a> appear to be getting along with their farm 
ing middling well. The prospect now is that the potato crop will be 
full middling good. Annie and Sarah go to school. Annie has be 
come a very correct reader. Sarah goes singing about as easy as an 
old shoe. Edward still continues in California. Father is carrying on 
his little farming on his own hook still, and seems to succeed very 
well. I am much gratified to have him able to do so, and he seems 
to enjoy it quite as much as ever he did. 1 I have now written about 
all I can well think of for this time.

DEAR SON JOHN, I now enclose five dollars to pay you for the expense of your trip to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> as near as I can. I would have

time so as to make that satisfactory. We drew three second premiums at the fair, but no first premium. Our bull by far the most 
extraordinary animal we have got no premium at all. We heard a very strong expression of dissatisfaction with the award on Devon 
bulls from numerous strangers, as well as from many good judges of our acquaintance, before we left the ground. We received a first 
premium on a yearling buck, and he was the meanest sheep of four teen that we exhibited ; we got no other premium on sheep.

DEAR CHILDREN, We received Ruth's letter of the 31st August 
a few days before our State fair at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a>, which came off on the 
15th, 16th, and 17th instant. John and myself expected to go from 
there to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, and John came on to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> for that purpose ; 
but just then we learned that our trial would not come on until 
November next. I may leave to go on to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> before November, 
but cannot say now. We got four premiums on cattle and sheep at 
the fair, two of ten dollars each, one of fifteen dollars, and one of 
twenty-five dollars. The Perkinses were much pleased with the 
show of stock we had to make, but felt, as many others did, that 
great injustice was done in not giving us but one first premium, and 
that on our poorest buck exhibited. The premiums were paid in 
silver cups, goblets, etc., and are of little use, except for mere show. 
All the friends were well at the time of the fair, and a large portion 
of them on the show-ground, father among the rest. It was sup 
posed to be the greatest exhibition ever had in the Western States, far 
exceeding those of the State of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> ; but a vast majority of 
those who were at much pains and cost to exhibit their stock and 
other things went away disappointed of any premiums. This is a 
mortifying reflection. 
</p><p>
We are busy taking care of our potatoes and apples, and preparing 
to sow our grain. I have had no shake of ague for some time, but 
am not strong. The family are in usual health. Write again. 
Your affectionate father,

DEAR WIFE, I have the satisfaction to say that we have at last 
got to trial, and I now hope that a little more than another week will 
terminate it. Up to this time our prospects appear favorable. ... I 
have no word for the boys, except to say I am very glad to hear they 
are doing so well, and that every day increases my anxiety that they 
all will decide to be wise and good j and I close by saying that such 
is by far my most earnest wish for you all.

DEAR CHILDREN, It was my intention, on parting with John at 
Conneaut, to have written you soon; but as Mr. Perkins (immediately on my return home) expressed a strong desire to have me 
continue with him at least for another year, I have deferred it, in 
hopes from day to day of being able to say to you on what terms I 
am to remain. His being absent almost the whole time has pre 
vented our making any definite bargain as yet, although we have 
talked considerably about it. Our bargain will not probably vary 
much from this, namely, he to furnish land, stock of all kinds, teams, 
and tools, pay taxes on lands, half the taxes on other property, and 
furnish half the salt ; I to furnish all the work, board the hands, pay 
half the taxes on personal property put in, half the interest on capital 
on stock, and half the insurance on same, and have half the proceeds 
of all grain and other crops raised, and of all the stock of cattle, 
sheep, hogs, etc. He seems so pleasant, and anxious to have me 
continue, that I cannot tear away from him. He is in quite as good 
spirits since he came home as I expected. 
</p><p>
We are all in good health ; so also was father and other Hudson 
friends a few days ago. Our sheep, cattle, etc., have done very well 
through the winter. Got a letter from Ruth a few days ago. All 
appears well with them. She writes that they have had quite a 
revival of religion there, and that Henry is one of the hopefully converted. My earnest and only wish is, that those seeming conversions 
may prove genuine, as I doubt not " there is joy over one sinner that repenteth." Will you write me?

DEAR CHILDREN, We received Henry's letter of the 16th August 
in due time, and when it came I intended to reply at once ; but not 
being very stout, and having many things to look after, it has been 
put off until now. We were very glad of that letter, and of the 
information it gave of your health and prosperity, as well as your 
future calculations. We have some nice turkeys and chickens fatten 
ing, to be ready by the time you come on to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a>. Father and 
Jason were both here this morning. Father is quite well. Jason, 
Ellen, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met">Owen</a>, and Fred have all been having the ague more or less 
since I wrote before. Other friends are in usual health, I believe. 
We have done part of our sowing, got our fine crop of corn all se 
cured against frosts yesterday, and are digging potatoes to-day. The 
season has been thus far one of great temporal blessing; and I would 
fain hope that the Spirit of God has not done striving in our hard 
hearts. I sometimes feel encouraged to hope that my sons will give 
up their miserable delusions and believe in God and in his Son our 
Saviour. I think the family are more and more decided in favor of 
returning to Essex, and seem all disposed to be making little prepa 
rations for it as we suppose the time draws near. Our county fair 
comes off on the 12th and 13th October, but we suppose we can 
hardly expect you so soon. Should be much pleased to have you 
here then. . . .

</p><p>
DEAR CHILDREN, I remember I engaged to write you so soon as 
I had anything to tell worth the paper. I do not suppose the balance 
will be great now. So far as I know, the friends here are about in 
usual health, and are passing through the winter prosperously. My 
wife is not in as good health as when you were here. Have not 
heard from Hudson for some days. The loss of sheep has been merely 
a nominal one with us. We have skinned two full-blood Devon 
heifers, from the effects of poison, as we suspect; for several of our 
young cattle were taken sick about the same time. The others appear 
to be nearly well. 
</p><p>
This world is not yet freed from real malice or envy. It appears 
to be well settled now that we go back to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=north elba" rel="city">North Elba</a>, in the spring. 
I have had a good-natured talk with Mr. Perkins about going away, 
and both families are now preparing to carry out that plan. I do 
not yet know what his intentions are about our compensation for the 
last year. 1 Will write you when I do, as I want you to hold yourself 
(John, I mean) in readiness to come out at once, should he decide to 
give me a share of the stock, etc. Should that be the case, I intend 
to let you have what will give you a little start in the way of red 
cattle. 
</p><p>
I learn, by your letters to others of the family, that you have pretty 
much decided to call your boy John, and that in order to gratify the 
feelings of his great-grandfather and grandfather. I will only now 
say that I hope to be able sometime to convince yon that I appreciate 
the sacrifices you may make to accommodate our feelings. I noticed 
your remark about the family settling near each other; to this I 
would say, I would like to have my posterity near enough to each 
other to be friendly, but would never wish them to be brought so in 
contact as to be near neighbors or to intermarry. I may possibly 
write you again very soon.

DEAR SON JOHN, I write by direction of Mr. Perkins to ask you 
to come out immediately to assist him, instead of Mr. Newton, in 
closing up my accounts. He has seen the above, and it is a thing of 
his own naming ; so I want you, if possible, to come right away. 
He has told me he intends to give me one share, but would like to 
have the stock mostly. We are on excellent terms, so far as I know. 
All well except my wife, and I hope she will soon be better.

</p><p>
DEAR SON JOHN, Since writing you before, I have agreed to go 
on to the Ward place for one year, as I found I could not dispose of 
my stuff in time to go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=north elba" rel="city">North Elba</a>, without great sacrifice this 
spring. We expect to move the first of next week, and do not wish 
you to come on until we get more settled and write you again. As I 
am not going away immediately, there will be no particular hurry 
about the settlement I wrote about before. On reckoning up our 
expenses for the past year, we find we have been quite prosperous. I 
have sold my interest in the increase of sheep to Mr. Perkins for 
about $700, in hogs for $51, in wheat on the ground for $176. These 
will pay our expenses for the year past, and the next year's rent for 
the Ward place, Crinlen place, and Old Portage place. These places 
I get for one year in exchange for my interest in wheat on the 
ground ; and it leaves me half the wool of last season (which is on 
hand yet), half the pork, corn, wheat, oats, hay, potatoes, and 
calves sixteen in number. If I could have sold my share of the wool, 
I might have gone to Essex this spring quite comfortably ; but I 
have to pay Henry $100 before he leaves, and I cannot do that and 
have sufficient to move with until I can sell my wool. We are all 
middling well. Henry and Ruth intend to leave for home about the 
15th March, and to go by your place if they can. We have great 
reason to be thankful that we have had so prosperous a year, and 
have terminated our connection with Mr. Perkins so comfortably and 
on such friendly terms, to all appearance. Perry Warren, to whom 
Henry Warren conveyed his property, was here a few days ago, feel 
ing about for a compromise : did nothing, and left, to return again 
soon as he said. We think they are getting tired of the five years 
war. I shall probably write you again before a great while.

</p><p>
DEAR SON JOHN, We received your letter of the 24th March two 
or three days since, and one from Henry, dated 25th March, about the 
same time. They had got on well so far, but had to go by stage the 
balance of the way. Father got home well, and was with us over 
night Friday last. We have all been middling well of late, but very 
busy, having had the care of the whole concern at Mr. Perkins's place 
until Friday night. I had a most comfortable time settling last year's 
business, and dividing with Mr. Perkins, and have to say of his deal 
ing with me that he has shown himself to be every inch a gentle 
man. I bring to my new home five of the red cows and ten calves ; 
he to have $100 out of my share of the last year's wool, to make us 
even on last year's business ; after dividing all crops, he paying me 
in hand $28.55, balance due me on all except four of the five cows. 
I am going now to work with a cheap team of two yoke oxen, on 
which I am indebted, till I can sell my wool, $89 ; $46 I have paid 
towards them. I would like to have all my children settle within a 
few miles of each other and of me, but I cannot take the responsibility of advising you to make any forced move to change your location. 
Thousands have to regret that they did not let middling "well alone." 
I should think you ought to get for your place another $J25; and 
I think you may, if you are not too anxious. That would buy you 
considerable of a farm in Essex or elsewhere, and we may get the 
Homestead Law passed yet. It has been a question with me whether 
you would not do better to hire all your team work done than to have 
your little place overstocked possibly, after some trouble about buy 
ing them, paying taxes, insurance, and some expense for implements 
to use them with. If you get a little overstocked, everything will 
seem to do poorly. Frederick is very much better, but both he and 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met">Owen</a> have been having the ague lately. They leave the Hill farm 
soon. I do not at this moment know of a good opening for you this 
way. One thing I do not fear to advise and even urge ; and that is 
the habitual " fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom." 
Commending you all to his mercy, I remain 
</p><p>

DEAR CHILDREN, I have just received Henry's letter of the 
13th instant, and have much reason to be thankful for the good news 
it brings. We are all in middling health, so far as I know, in this 
quarter, although there is some sickness about us. Mother Brown, 
of Hudson, was complaining some last week ; have not heard from 
her since then. This part of the country is suffering the most dreadful drouth ever experienced during this nineteenth century. We 
have been much more highly favored than most of our neighbors in 
that we were enabled to secure a most excellent hay crop, whilst 
many others did not get theirs saved in time, and lost it notwith 
standing the dry weather. Our oats are no better than those of our 
neighbors, but we have a few. We shall probably have some corn, 
while others, to a great extent, will have none. Of garden vegetables 
we have more than twenty poor families have in many cases. Of 
fruit we shall have a comfortable supply, if our less favored neighbors do not take it all from us. We ought to be willing to divide. 
Our cattle (of which we have thirty-three head) we are enabled to 
keep in excellent condition, on the little feed that grows on the moist 
grounds, and by feeding the stalks green that have failed of corn, 
and we have a good many of them. We have had two light frosts, 
on August the 9th and 18th, but have had more extreme hot 
weather in July and August than ever known before, thermometer 
often up to 98 in the shade, and was so yesterday ; it now stands 
(eleven o clock p. M.) at 93. 
</p><p>
I am thinking that it may be best for us to dispose of all the cattla 
we want to sell, and of all our winter feed, and move a few choice 
cattle to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=north elba" rel="city">North Elba</a>, this fall, provided we can there buy hay and 
other stuff considerably cheaper than we might sell our stuff for here, 
and also provided we can get a comfortable house to winter in. I 
want you to keep writing me often, as you can learn how hay, all 
kinds of grain, and roots can be bought with you, so that I may be the 
better able to judge. Our last year's pork proves to be a most perfect article, but I think not best to ship any until the weather gets a 
little cooler. The price Mr. Washburn asks for his contract may not 
be much out of the way, but there seems to be some difficulty about 
a bargain yet. First, he wants to hang on all his stock, and I do not 
know at present as I want any of them. I do not know what he has 
on hand ; he may perhaps be able to get them off himself. Then, 
again, I do not know as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Mr. Smith</a> would give a deed of half the lot 
before the whole purchase-money for the entire lot and interest are 
paid. You may have further information than I have. Early in 
the season all kinds of cattle were high, scarce and ready cash; 
now, as the prospects are, I am entirely unable to make an estimate 
of what money I can realize on them, so as to be able to say just now 
how much money I can raise, provided those other impediments can 
be got over. I intend to turn all I consistently can into money, and 
as fast as I can, and would be glad to secure the purchase of Wash- 
burn, if it can be done consistently and without too much trouble. 
Write me again soon, and advise as far as you can about all these 
matters. We could probably sell all our produce at pretty high 
prices. How are cattle, horses, sheep, and hogs selling in your 
quarter?

DEAR CHILDREN, Last night your letters to Jason were received (dated December 26), and I had the reading of them. I 
conclude from the long time mine to you from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a> was on the 
way, that you did not reply to it. On my return here from North 
Elba I was disappointed of about three hundred dollars for cattle 
sold to brother Frederick, and am still in the same condition, he 
having gone to Illinois just before I left to go East, and not having 
returned nor written me a word since. This puts it out of my power 
to move my family at present, and will until I get my money, unless 
I sell off my Devon cattle, which I cannot, without great sacrifice, 
before spring opens. Your remarks about hay make me doubt the 
propriety of taking on any cattle till spring, as I have here an abun 
dance of feed. I am now entirely unable to say whether we can get 
off before spring or not. All are well here, so far as we know. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met">Owen</a> 
and Frederick were with their uncle Edward in Meridosia, 111. (where 
they expect to winter), on the 23d December; they were well, and 
much pleased with the country, and with him. You can write them 
at that place, care of Edward Lusk, Esq. I may send on one of the 
boys before the family go, but am not now determined. Can write 
no more now for want of time. Write me, on receipt of this, any and 
every thing of use or interest.

news to write you about <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met">Owen</a> and Frederick ; but they are so negli

an encouraging word about Kansas from Mr. Adair the other day. 
He had before given quite a gloomy picture of things. He and family were all. well. The friends here were all well a few days since. 
John and Wealthy have gone back to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vernon" rel="city">Vernon</a>, John taking with him iny old surveyor's instruments, in consideration of having learned to 
survey. I have but little to write that will interest you, so I need 
not be lengthy. I think we may be able to get off in March, and I 
mean to sell some of our Devon cattle in order to effect it, if I can do 
no better. I should send on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a> within a few days, if I thought 
I could manage to get along with the family and cattle without his help. 
I may conclude to do so still before we get away. The last of January 
and February, up to yesterday, have been very remarkable for uninterrupted cold weather for this section. We were glad to learn that 
you had succeeded in getting the house so comfortable. I want 
Johnny should be so good a boy that " 95 will not turn him off." 
Can you tell whether the Stout lot was ever redeemed in December 
or not by the owners...

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, I reached here on the first day 
of the convention, and I have reason to bless God that I came ; for I have met with a most warm reception from all, so far as I know, 
and except by a few sincere, honest peace friends a most hearty 
approval of my intention of arming my sons and other friends in 
Kansas. I received to-day donations amounting to a little over sixty 
dollars, twenty from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Gerrit Smith</a>, five from an old British officer ; l 
others giving smaller sums with such earnest and affectionate expres 
sions of their good wishes as did me more good than money even. 
John's two letters were introduced, and read with such effect by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Gerrit Smith</a> as to draw tears from numerous eyes in the great collection 
of people present. The convention has been one of the most interesting meetings I ever attended in my life ; and I made a great 
addition to the number of warm-hearted and honest friends.

DEAR FATHER, MOTHER, BROTHERS, AND SISTERS, We received a few days since a letter from mother, since then one from 
father, which we were all very glad to get. I should have written you before, but since we laid little Austin in the grave I have not felt as 
if I could write. I shall not attempt to say much now. We fully believe that Austin is happy with his Maker in another existence ; 
and if there is to be a separation of friends after death, we pray God to keep us in the way of truth, and that we may so run our short 
course as to be able to enjoy his company again. Ellen feels so lonely and discontented here without Austin, that we shall go back 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> next fall if she does not enjoy herself better. I am well pleased with the country, and can be as well content here as any 
where else if it proves to be healthy. It is a very rich and beautiful country. I should think it would be altogether best for father to 
come by land from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a>. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=sab" rel="child met">Salmon</a> has a very good claim (as well as the rest of us), and seems to be very much pleased with it. 
We are all living together in tents and in the wagon, and have no houses yet. I used all the money I had for freight and passage be 
fore I got here, and had to borrow of John. We have no stoves j I 
wish now that we had brought ours along. We would all like to 
hear from you often. All well. 
</p><p>
Your affectionate son and brother, 
</p><p>
J. L. BROWN. 
</p><p>
P. S. If you should come by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> on your way here, and could 
buy and box up a middle-sized stove and furniture, with about four 
lengths of pipe, and send or bring it to me at Kansas City, I will 
contrive some way to pay you for it. I think they can be got there 
and shipped here cheaper than they can be bought here. I would 
like to have you inquire* if you will.

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, I see that Henry 
has given you so full a history of our matters that I have but little to 
say now, but to add that we start from here this morning, all well. 
We have a nice young horse, for which we paid here $120, but have 
so much load that we shall have to walk a good deal enough prob 
ably to supply ourselves with game. We have provided ourselves 
with the most of what we need on our outward march. If you get 
this on Tuesday and answer it on Wednesday, some of you directing 
on the outside to Oliver, at Rock Island, 111., we should probably get 
your answer there. Oliver's name is not so common as either Henry's 
or mine. We shall write you often, and hope you will do so by us. 
You may direct one to Oliver at Kansas City, Mo., as we may go 
there, and shall be very glad to hear from you. Write us soon at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a>. Kansas, and may God Almighty bless you all!

SCOTT COUNTY, IOWA, Sept. 4 [<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1855">1855</a>], in Morning. 
</p><p>
DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, ALL, I am writing in our tent 
about twenty miles west of the Mississippi, to let you know that we 
are all in good health and how we get along. We had some delay 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">Chicago</a> on account of our freight not getting on as we expected j 
while there we bought a stout young horse that proves to be a very 
good one, but he has been unable to travel fast for several days from 
having taken the distemper. We think he appears quite as well as 
he has, this morning ; and we hope he will not fail us. Our load is 
heavy, so that we have to walk most of the time ; indeed, all the 
time the last day. The roads are mostly very good, and we can make some progress if our horse does not fail us. We fare very well 
on crackers, herring, boiled eggs, prairie chicken, tea, and sometimes a 
little milk. Have three chickens now cooking for our breakfast. We 
shoot enough of them on the wing as we go along to supply us with 
fresh meat. Oliver succeeds in bringing them down quite as well as 
any of us. Our expenses before we got away from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">Chicago</a> had been 
very heavy; since then very light, so that we hope our money will 
not entirely fail us ; but we shall not have any of account left when 
we get through. 
</p><p>
We expect to go direct through Missouri, and if we are not obliged 
to stop on account of our horse, shall soon be there. We mean to 
write you often when we can. We got to Rock Island too soon for any letter from you, but shall not be too early at Kansas City, where 
we hope to hear from you. The country through which we have travelled from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">Chicago</a> has been mostly very good ; the worst fault 
is want of living streams of water. With all the comforts we have 
along our journey, I think, could I hope in any other way to answer the end of my being, I would be quite content to be at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=north elba" rel="city">North Elba</a>,. 
</p><p>
I have directed the sale of the cattle in Connecticut, and to have 
the rest sent in a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> draft payable to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson's</a> order, which 
I hope will make you all quite comfortable. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a> should get 
something more at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=elizabethtown" rel="city">Elizabethtown</a>. than the mere face of the draft. 
He will need to write his name across the back of the draft when he 
sells it : about two inches from the top end would be the proper place. 
I want you to make the most of the money you get, as I expect to be 
very poor about money from any other source. Commend you all to 
the mercy and infinite grace of God. I bid you all good-by for this 
time.

Saturday Eve. 
</p><p>
DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, We reached the 
place where the boys are located one week ago, late at night; at 
least Henry and Oliver did. I, being tired, stayed behind in our 
tent, a mile or two back. As the mall goes from here early Monday 
morning, we could get nothing here in time for that mail. We found 
all more or less sick or feeble but Wealthy and Johnny. 2 All at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=brownsville" rel="city">Brownsville</a> appear now to be mending, but all sick or feeble here at Mr. Adair s. Fever and agufc and chill-fever seem to be very general. 
Oliver has had a turn of the ague since he got here, but has got it 
broken. Henry has had no return since first breaking it. We met 
with no difficulty in passing through Missouri, but from the sickness 
of our horse and our heavy load. The horse has entirely recovered. 
We had, between us all, sixty cents in cash when we arrived. We 
found our folks in a most uncomfortable situation, with no houses to 
shelter one of them, no hay or corn fodder of any account secured, 
shivering over their little fires, all exposed to the dreadful cutting 
winds, morning and evening and stormy days. We have been trying 
to help them all in our power, and hope to get them more comfortable 
soon. I think much of their ill health is owing to most unreasonable 
exposure. Mr. Adair's folks would be quite comfortable if they were 
well. One letter from wife and Anne to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=sab" rel="child met">Salmon</a>, of August 10, and 
one from Ruth to John, of 19th September, is all I have seen from 
any of you since getting here. Henry found one from Ruth, which 
he has not shown me. Need I write that I shall be glad to hear 
from you? I did not write while in Missouri, because I had no confidence in your getting my letters. We took up little Austin and 
brought him on here, which appears to be a great comfort to Jason 
and Ellen. We were all out a good part of the last night, helping 
to keep the prairie fire from destroying everything ; so that I am 
almost blind to-day, or I would write you more. 
</p><p>
Sabbath Eve, October 14. 
</p><p>
I notice in your letter to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=sab" rel="child met">Salmon</a> your trouble about the means of 
having the house made more comfortable for winter, and I fondly 
hope you have been relieved on that score before now, by funds 
from Mr. Hurlbut, of Winchester, Conn., from the sale of the cattle 
there. Write me all about your situation ; for, if disappointed from 
that source, I shall make every effort to relieve you in some other 
way. Last Tuesday was an election clay with Free- State men in 
Kansas, and hearing that there was a prospect of difficulty we all 
turned out most thoroughly armed (except Jason, who was too feeble) ; but no enemy appeared, nor have I heard of any disturbance 
in any part of the Territory. Indeed, I believe Missouri is fast be 
coming discouraged about making Kansas a slave State, and I think 
the prospect of its becoming free is brightening every day. Try to 
be cheerful, and always ll hope in God," who will not leave nor for 
sake them that trust in him. Try to comfort and encourage each 
other all you can. You are all very dear to me, and I humbly trust 
we may be kept and spared to meet again on earth ; but if not, let 
us all endeavor earnestly to secure admission to that eternal home, 
where will be no more bitter separations, " where the wicked shall 
cease from troubling and the weary be at rest." We shall probably 
spend a few days more in helping the boys to provide some kind of 
shelter for winter, and mean to write you often. May God in infinite 
mercy bless, comfort, and save you all, for Christ's sake! 
Your affectionate husband and father,

</p><p>
DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, We last week received <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson's</a> letter of October 3, too late to answer till now. I 
felt grateful to learn that you were all then well, and I think I fully 
sympathize with you in all the hardships and discouragements you 
have to meet ; but you may be assured you are not alone in having 
trials. I believe I wrote you that we found every one here more or less 
unwell but Wealthy and Johnny, without any sort of a place where 
a stout man even could protect himself from the cutting cold winds 
and storms, which prevail here (the winds, I mean, in particular) much 
more than in any place where we have ever lived ; and that no crops 
of hay or anything raised had been taken care of; with corn wasting 
by cattle and horses, without fences; and, I may add, without any 
meat ; and Jason's folks without sugar, or any kind of breadstuffs but 
corn ground with great labor in a hand-mill about two miles off. Since 
I wrote before, Wealthy, Johnny, Ellen, and myself have escaped 
being sick. Some have had the ague, but lightly ; but Jason and 
Oliver have had a hard time of it, and are yet feeble. They appear 
some better just now. Under existing circumstances we have made 
but little progress ; but we have made a little. We have got a shanty 
three logs high, chinked, and mudded, and roofed with our tent, and 
John has his shanty a little better fixed than it was, but miserable 
enough now; and we have got their little crop of beans secured, 
which, together with johunycake, mush and milk, pumpkins, and 
squashes, constitute our fare. Potatoes they have none of any ac 
count ; milk, beans, pumpkins, and squashes a very moderate supply, 
just for the present use. We have also got a few house- logs cut for 
Jason. I do not send you this account to render you more unhappy, 
but merely to let you know that those here are not altogether in 
paradise, while you have to stay in that miserable frosty region. 
We had here, October 25, the hardest freezing I ever witnessed south 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=north elba" rel="city">North Elba</a>, at that season of the year. 
</p><p>
After all, God's tender mercies are not taken from us, and blessed 
be his name forever! I believe things will a little brighten here 
before long, and as the winter approaches, and that we may be able 
to send you a more favorable account. There is no proper officer 
before whom a deed can be acknowledged short of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, and 
Jason and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met">Owen</a> have not been able to go there at all since we got 
here. I want to learn very much whether you have received any 
return from the cattle of Mr. Hurlbut, in Connecticut, so that I may 
at once write him if you have riot. I trust you will not neglect this, 
as it takes so long to get letters through, and it will greatly lessen my 
anxiety about your being made in some measure comfortable for the 
winter. We hear that the fall has been very sickly in Ohio and other 
States. I can discover no reason why this country should continue 
sickly, but it has proven exceedingly so this fall. I feel more and 
more confident that slavery will soon die out here, and to God be 
the praise! Commending you all to his infinite grace, I remain 
Your affectionate husband and father,

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, ALL, Ruth's letter to Henry, 
saying she was about moving, and dated 23d October (I think), 
was received by last week's mail. We were all glad to learn again 
of your welfare ; and as to your all staying in one house, I can see 
no possible objection, if you can only be well agreed, and try to make each other as comfortable as may be. Nothing new of account 
has occurred amongst us since I wrote. Henry, Jason, and Oliver 
are unable to do much yet, but appear to have but little ague now. 
The others are all getting middling well. We have got both families 
so sheltered that they need not suffer hereafter ; have got part of the 
hay (which had lain in cocks) secured; made some progress in preparation to build a house for John and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met">Owen</a> ; and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=sab" rel="child met">Salmon</a> has caught 
a prairie wolf in the steel trap. We continue to have a good deal of 
stormy weather, rains with severe winds, and forming into ice as 
they fall, together with cold nights that freeze the ground consider 
ably. " Still God has not forsaken us," and we get " day by day 
our daily bread," and I wish we all had a great deal more gratitude 
to mingle with our undeserved blessings. Much suffering would be 
avoided by people settling in Kansas, were they aware that they 
would need plenty of warm clothing and light warm houses as much 
as in New Hampshire or Vermont; for such is the fact. 
</p><p>
Since <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a> wrote, I have felt a great deal troubled about your 
prospects of a cold house to winter in, and since I wrote last I have 
thought of a cheap ready way to help it much, at any rate. Take 
any common straight-edged boards, and run them from the ground 
up to the eaves, barn fashion, riot driving the nails in so far but that 
they may easily be drawn, covering all but doors and windows as 
close as may be in that way, and breaking joints if need be. This 
can be done by any one, and in any weather not very severe, and the 
boards may afterwards be mostly saved for other uses. I think much, 
too, of your widowed state, and I sometimes allow myself to dream a 
little of again some time enjoying the comforts of home ; but I do 
not dare to dream much. May God abundantly reward all your 
sacrifices for the cause of humanity, and a thousandfold more than 
compensate yonr lack of worldly connections! We have received two 
newspapers you sent us, which were indeed a great treat, shut away 
as we are from the means of getting the news of the day. Should 
you continue to direct them to some of the boys, after reading, we 
should prize them much.

 </p><p>
Sabbath Evening. 
</p><p>
DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, I improve the first mail since my return from the camp of volunteers, who lately turned 
out for the defence of the town of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> in this Territory; and not withstanding I suppose you have learned the result before this (possibly) , will give a brief account of the invasion in my own way. 
</p><p>
About three or four weeks ago news came that a Free-State man by the name of Dow had been murdered by a proslavery man by 
the name of Coleman, who had gone and given himself up for trial to the proslavery Governor Shannon. This was soon followed by further news that a Free-State man who was the only reliable witness against the murderer had been seized by a Missourian (appointed 
sheriff by the bogus Legislature of Kansas) upon false pretexts, examined, and held to bail under such heavy bonds, to answer to those 
false charges, as he could not give; that while on his way to trial, 
in charge of the bogus sheriff, he was rescued by some men belong 
ing to a company near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>; and that in consequence of the 
rescue Governor Shannon had ordered out all the proslavery force he 
could muster in the Territory, and called on Missouri for further help ; 
that about two thousand had collected, demanding a surrender of the 
rescued witness and of the rescuers, the destruction of several buildings and printing-presses, and a giving up of the Sharpe's rifles by 
the Free-State men, threatening to destroy the town with cannon, 
with which they were provided, etc. ; that about an equal number of 
Free-State men had turned out to resist them, and that a battle was 
hourly expected or supposed to have been already fought. 
</p><p>
These reports appeared to be well authenticated, but we could get 
no further account of matters ; and I left this for the place where the 
boys are settled, at evening, intending to go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> to learn 
the facts the next day. John was, however, started on horseback ; 
but before he had gone many rods, word came that our help was im 
mediately wanted. On getting this last news, it was at once agreed 
to break up at John's camp, and take Wealthy and- Johnny to Jason's 
camp (some two miles off), and that all the men but Henry, Jason, 
and Oliver should at once set on" for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> under arms ; those 
three being wholly unfit for duty. We then set about providing a little 
corn-bread and meat, blankets, and cooking utensils, running bullets 
and loading all our guns, pistols, etc. ,The five set off in the after 
noon, and after a short rest in the night (which was quite dark), continued our march until after daylight next morning, when we got our 
breakfast, started again, and reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> in the forenoon, all of 
us more or less larned by our tramp. On reaching the place we found 
that negotiations had commenced between Governor Shannon (having 
a force of some fifteen or sixteen hundred men) and the principal 
leaders of the Free-State men, they having a force of some five hundred men at that time. These were busy, night and day, fortifying 
the town with embankments and circular earthworks, up to the time 
of the treaty with the Governor, as an attack was constantly looked 
for, notwithstanding the negotiations then pending. This state of 
things continued from Friday until Sunday evening. 1 On the even 
ing we left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a> a company of the invaders, of from fifteen to 
twenty-five, attacked some three or four Free-State men, mostly un 
armed, killing a Mr. Barber from Ohio, wholly unarmed. His body 
was afterward brought in and lay for some days in the room afterward occupied by a part of the company to which we belong (it being 
organized after we reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>). The building was a large 
unfinished stone hotel, in which a great part of the volunteers were 
quartered, who witnessed the scene of bringing in the wife and other 
friends of the murdered man. I will only say of this scene that it was 
heart-rending, and calculated to exasperate the men exceedingly, and 
one of the sure results of civil war. 
</p><p>
After frequently calling on the leaders of the Free- State men to 
come and have an interview with him, by Governor Shannon, and 
after as often getting for an answer that if he had any business to 
transact with any one in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, to come and attend to it, he 
signified his wish to come into the town, 1 and an escort was sent to 
the invaders camp to conduct him in. When there, the leading Free- 
State men, finding out his weakness, frailty, and consciousness of the 
awkward circumstances into which he had really got himself, took 
advantage of his cowardice and folly, and by means of that and the 
free use of whiskey and some trickery succeeded in getting a written 
arrangement with him much to their own liking. He stipulated with 
them to order the proslavery men of Kansas home, and to proclaim 
to the Missouri invaders that they must quit the Territory without 
delay, and also to give up General Pomeroy (a prisoner in their 
camp), which was all done; he also recognizing the volunteers as 
the militia of Kansas, and empowering their officers to call them out 
whenever in their discretion the safety of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> or other portions 
of the Territory might require it to be done. He (Governor Shan 
non) gave up all pretension of further attempt to enforce the enactments of the bogus Legislature, and retired, subject to the derision 
and scoffs of the Free-State men (into whose hands he had committed 
the welfare and protection of Kansas), and to the pity of some and 
the curses of others of the invading force. 
</p><p>
So ended this last Kansas invasion, the Missourians returning 
with flying colors, after incurring heavy expenses, suffering great exposure, hardships, and privations, not having fought any battles, 
burned or destroyed any infant towns or Abolition presses ; leaving the Free-State men organized and armed, and in full possession of 
the Territory; not having fulfilled any of all their dreadful threatenings, except to murder one unarmed man, and to commit some robberies and waste of property upon defenceless families, unfortunately within their power. We learn by their papers that they boast of a 
great victory over the Abolitionists ; and well they may. Free-State men have only hereafter to retain the footing they have gained, 
and Kansas is free. Yesterday the people passed upon the Free-State constitution. The result, though not yet known, no one doubts. 
</p><p>
One little circumstance, connected with our own number, showing 
a little of the true character of those invaders : On our way, about 
three miles from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, we had to pass a bridge (with our arms 
and ammunition) of which the invaders held possession ; but as the 
five of us had each a gun, with two large revolvers in a belt exposed 
to view, with a third in his pocket, and as we moved directly on to 
the bridge without making any halt, they for some reason suffered 
us to pass without interruption, notwithstanding there were some 
fifteen to twenty-five (as variously reported) stationed in a log-house 
at one end of the bridge. We could not count them. A boy on our 
approach ran and gave them notice. Five others of our company, 
well armed, who followed us some miles behind, met with equally 
civil treatment the same day. After we left to go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, 
until we returned when disbanded, I did not see the least sign of 
cowardice or want of self-possession exhibited by any volunteer of 
the eleven companies who constituted the Free-State force; and I 
never expect again to see an equal number of such well-behaved, cool, determined men, fully, as I believe, sustaining the high character of the Revolutionary fathers. But enough of this, as we intend 
to send you a paper giving a more full account of the affair. We 
have cause for gratitude in that we all returned safe and well, with 
the exception of hard colds, and found those left behind rather improving. 
</p><p>
We have received fifty dollars from father, and learn from him that he has sent you the same amount, for which we ought to be 
grateful, as we are much relieved, both as respects ourselves and you. The mails have been kept back during the invasion, but we hope to 
hear from you again soon. Mr. Adair's folks are well, or nearly so. Weather mostly pleasant, but sometimes quite severe. No snow of 
account as yet. Can think of but little more to-night. 
</p><p>
Monday Morning, December 17. 
</p><p>
The ground for the first time is barely whitened with snow, and it is quite cold ; but we have before had a good deal of cold weather, with 
heavy rains. Henry and Oliver and, I may [say] , Jason were disappointed in not being able to go to war. The disposition at both our 
camps to turn out was uniform. I believe I have before acknowledged the receipt of a letter from you and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a>. Have just taken 
one from the office for Henry that I think to be from Ruth. Do write often, and let me know all about how you get along through 
the winter. May God abundantly bless you all, and make you faithful.

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, Yours and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson's</a> 
letters to the boys and myself, of December 30 and January 1, were 
received by last mail. We are all very glad to hear again of your 
welfare, and I am particularly grateful when I am noticed by a letter 
from you. I have just taken out two letters for Henry [Thompson], 
one of which, I suppose, is from Ruth. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=sab" rel="child met">Salmon</a> and myself are so 
far on our way home from Missouri, and only reached Mr. Adair's 
last night. They are all well, and we know of nothing but all are 
well at the boys shanties. The weather continues very severe, and 
it is now nearly six weeks that the snow has been almost constantly 
driven, like dry sand, by the fierce winds of Kansas. Mr. Adair has 
been collecting ice of late from the Osage River, which is nine and 
a half inches thick, of perfect clear solid ice, formed under the 
snow. By means of the sale of our horse and wagon, our present 
wants are tolerably well met, so that, if health is continued to us, we 
shall not probably suffer much. The idea of again visiting those of 
my dear family at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=north elba" rel="city">North Elba</a>, is so calculated to unman me, that I 
seldom allow my thoughts to dwell upon it, and I do not think best 
to write much about it ; suffice it to say, that God is abundantly 
able to keep both us and you, and in him let ns all trust. We have 
just learned of some new and shocking outrages at Leavenworth, and 
that the Free-State people there have fled to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, which 
place is again threatened with an attack. Should that take place, 
we may soon again be called upon to li buckle on our armor," which 
by the help of God we will do, when T suppose Henry and Oliver 
will have a chance. My judgment is, that we shall have no general 
disturbance until warmer weather. I have more to say, but not time 
now to say it ; so farewell for this time. Write! 
Your affectionate husband and father,

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, ... Thermometer on Sunday and Monday at twenty-eight to twenty-^nine below zero. 
Tee in the river, in the timber, and under the snow, eighteen inches thick this week. On our return to where the boys live we found 
Jason again down with the ague, but he was some better yesterday. Oliver was also laid up by freezing his toes, one great toe so badly 
frozen that the nail has come off. He will be crippled for some days yet. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met">Owen</a> has one foot some frozen. We have middling tough 
times (as some would call them), but have enougli to eat, and abundant reasons for the most unfeigned gratitude. It is likely that when 
the snow goes off, such high water will prevail as will render it difficult for Missouri to invade the Territory ; so that God by his elements 
may protect Kansas for some time yet. . . . Write me as to all your wants for the coming spring and summer. I hope you will all be led 
to seek G-od " with your whole heart; " and I pray him. in his mercy, to be found of you. All mail communications are entirely cut off by 
the snowdrifts, so that we get no news whatever this week. . . .

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, Your letter to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=sab" rel="child met">Salmon</a>, and Ruth's to Henry and Ellen, of 6th and 16th January, 
were received by last week's mail. This week we get neither letter 
nor paper from any of you. I need not continually repeat that we 
are always glad to hear from you. and to learn of your welfare. I 
wish that to be fully understood. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=sab" rel="child met">Salmon</a> and myself are here again, 
on our way back from Missouri, where we have been for corn, as 
what the boys had raised was used up, stock and families having to 
live on it mainly while it lasted. We had to pay thirty cents per 
bushel for corn. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=sab" rel="child met">Salmon</a> has had the ague again, while we have 
been gone, and had a hard shake yesterday. To-day is his well day. 
We found Henry and Frederick here helping Mr. Adair ; and I have 
been helping also yesterday and to-day. Those behind were as well 
as usual a day or two since. I have but little to write this time, 
except to tell you about the weather, and to complain of the almost 
lack of news from the United States. We are very anxious to 
know what Congress is doing. We hear that Frank Pierce means 
to crush the men of Kansas. I do not know how well he may succeed ; but I think he may find his hands full before it is all over. 
For a few days the snow has melted a little, and it begins to seem 
like early March in Ohio. I have agreed either to buy the line- 
backed cow of Henry, or to pay five dollars for the use of her and 
keep her a year, whichever may hereafter appear best ; so that, if 
she lives, you can calculate on the use of her. I have also written 
Mr. Hurlbut, of Connecticut, further in regard to the cattle, and 
think you will soon hear something from him. No more now. May 
God Almighty bless you and all good friends at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=north elba" rel="city">North Elba</a>,!

</p><p>
DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, I wrote you last week, enclosing <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> draft for thirty dollars, made payable to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a> ; twenty dollars of which were to be given to Ruth, in part payment for the spotted cow, the balance to be used as circumstances 
might require. I would have sent you more, but I had no way to do it, arid money is very scarce with me indeed. Since I wrote last, three letters have been received by the boys from Ruth, dated March 5 and 9, and one of same date from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a>. The general tone of those letters I like exceedingly. We do not want you to borrow trouble about us, but trust us to the care of " Him who feeds the young 
ravens when they cry." I have, as usual, but little to write. We 
are doing off a house for Orson Day, which we hope to get through 
with soon ; after which we shall probably soon leave this neighbor 
hood, but will advise you further when we do leave. It may be that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a> can manage to get a little money for shearing sheep if you 
do not get any from Connecticut. I still hope you will get help from that source. We have no wars as yet, but we still have abundance 
of " rumors." We still have frosty nights, but the grass starts a little. There are none of us complaining much just now, all being 
able to do something. John has just returned from Topeka, 1 not having met with any difficulty ; but we hear that preparations are 
making in the United States Court for numerous arrests of FreeState men. 2 For one, I have no desire (all things considered) to 
have the slave-power cease from its acts of aggression. u Their foot shall slide in due time." No more now. May God bless and keep you all!

</p><p>
DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, It is now about five weeks since I have seen a line from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=north elba" rel="city">North Elba</a>,, or had any chance 
of writing you. During that period we here have passed through 
an almost constant series of very trying events. We were called to 
go to the relief of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, May 22, and every man (eight in all), 
except Orson, turned out; he staying with the women and children, 
and to take care of the cattle. 1 John was captain of a company to 
which Jason belonged ; the other six were a little company by our 
selves. On our way to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> we learned that it had been already 
destroyed, and we encamped with John's company overnight. Next 
day our little company left, and during the day we stopped and 
searched three men. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> was destroyed in this way : Their leading men had (as 
I think) decided, in a very cowardly manner, not to resist any process having any Government official to serve it, notwithstanding the 
process might be wholly a bogus affair. The consequence was that 
a man called a United States marshal came on with a horde of 
ruffians which he called his posse, and after arresting a few persons 
turned the ruffians loose on the defenceless people. They robbed the 
inhabitants of their money and other property, and even women of 
their ornaments, and burned considerable of the town. 
</p><p>
On the second day and evening after we left John's men we 
encountered quite a number of proslavery men, and took quite a number prisoners. Our prisoners we let go ; but we kept some four 
or five horses. We were immediately after this accused of murdering 
five men at Pottawatomie, and great efforts have since been made by 
the Missourians and their ruffian allies to capture us. John's company soon afterward disbanded, and also the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a> men. Jason started to go and place himself under the protection of the 
Government troops ; but on his way he was taken prisoner by the 
Bogus men, and is yet a prisoner, I suppose. John tried to hide for 
several days ; but from feelings of the ungrateful conduct of those 
who ought to have stood by him, excessive fatigue, anxiety, and constant loss of sleep, he became quite insane, and in that situation 
gave up, or, as we are told, was betrayed at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a> into the 
hands of the Bogus men. We do not know all the truth about this 
affair. He has since, we are told, been kept in irons, and brought to 
a trial before a bogus court, the result of which we have not yet 
learned. We have great anxiety both for him and Jason, and 
numerous other prisoners with the enemy (who have all the while 
had the Government troops to sustain them). We can only commend 
them to God.

For Mr. [Edmund B.] Whitman. 
</p><p>
Names of sufferers and persons who have made sacrifices in endeavoring to maintain and advance the Free-State cause in Kansas, 
within my personal knowledge. 
</p><p>
1. Two German refugees (thoroughly Free-State), robbed at Pottawatomie, named Benjamin and Bondy (or Bandy). One has served 
under me as a volunteer ; namely, Bondy. Benjamin was prisoner 
for some time. Suffered by men under Coffee and Pate. 
</p><p>
2. Henry Thompson. Devoted several months to the Free-State 
cause, travelling nearly two thousand miles at his own expense for 
the purpose, leaving family and business for about one year. Served 
under me as a volunteer ; was dangerously wounded at Palmyra, or 
Black Jack ; has a bullet lodged beside his backbone ; has had a 
severe turn of fever, and is still very feeble. Suffered a little in burn 
ing of the houses of John Brown, Jr., and Jason Brown. 
</p><p>
3. John, Jr., and Jason Brown. Both burned out ; both prisoners 
for some time, one a prisoner still ; both losing the use of valuable, 
partially improved claims. Both served repeatedly as volunteers for 
defence of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> and other places, suffering great hardships and 
some cruelty. 
</p><p>
4. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met">Owen</a> and Frederick Brown. Both served at different periods 
as volunteers under me; were both in the battle of Palmyra j both 
suffered by the burning of their brothers houses ; both have had 
sickness (<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met">Owen</a> a severe one), and are yet feeble. Both lost the use 
of partially improved claims and their spring and summer work. 
</p><p>
5. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=sab" rel="child met">Salmon</a> Brown (minor). Twice served under me as a volunteer; was dangerously wounded (if not permanently crippled) by 
accident near Palmyra ; had a severe sickness, and still feeble. 
</p><p>
6. Oliver Brown (minor). Served under me as a volunteer for 
some months; was in the battle of Palmyra, and had some sickness. 
</p><p>
7. [B. L.J Cochrau (at Pottawatomie). Twice served under me 
as a volunteer ; was in the battle of Palmyra. 1 
</p><p>
8. Dr. Lucius Mills devoted some months to the Free-State cause, 
collecting and giving information, prescribing for and nursing the 
sick and wounded at his own cost. Is a worthy Free-State man. 
</p><p>
9. John Brown has devoted the service of himself and two minor 
sons to the Free-State cause for more than a year ; suffered by the 
fire before named and by robbery ; has gone at his own cost for that 
period, except that he and his company together have received forty 
dollars in cash, two sacks of flour, thirty-five pounds bacon, thirty- 
five do. sugar, and twenty pounds rice. 
</p><p>
I propose to serve hereafter in the Free-State cause (provided my 
needful expenses can be met), should that be desired; and to raise a 
small regular force to serve on the same condition. My own means 
are so far exhausted that I can no longer continue in the service 
at present without the means of defraying my expenses are furnished me. 
</p><p>
I can give the names of some five or six more volunteers of special 
merit I would be glad to have particularly noticed in some way.

 </p><p>
DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, I have one moment 
to write to you, to say that I am yet alive, that Jason and family 
were well yesterday; John and family, I hear, are well (he being 
yet a prisoner). On the morning of the 30th of August an attack 
was made by the Kuffians on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a>, numbering some four 
hundred, by whose scouts our dear Frederick was shot dead without 
warning, he supposing them to be Free-State men, as near as we 
can learn. One other man, a cousin of Mr. Adair, was murdered by 
them about the same time that Frederick was killed, and one badly 
wounded at the same time. At this time I was about three miles 
off, where I had some fourteen or fifteen men over night that I had 
just enlisted to serve under me as regulars. These I collected as 
well as I could, with some twelve or fifteen more ; and in about 
three quarters of an hour I attacked them from a wood with thick 
undergrowth. With this force we threw them into confusion for 
about fifteen or twenty minutes, during which time we killed or 
wounded from seventy to eighty of the enemy, as they say, and then we escaped as well as we could, with one killed while escaping, 
two or three wounded, and as many more missing. Four or five 
Free-State men were butchered during the day in all. Jason fought 
bravely by my side during the fight, and escaped with me, he being 
unhurt. I was struck by a partly-spent grape, canister, or rifle shot, 
which bruised me some, but did not injure me seriously. " Hitherto 
the Lord has helped me," notwithstanding my afflictions. Things 
seem rather quiet just now, but what another hour will bring I can 
not say. I have seen three or four letters from Ruth, and one from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a>, of July or August, which are all I have seen since in June. 
I was very glad to hear once more from you, and hope that you will 
continue to write to some of the friends, so that I may hear from you. 
I am utterly unable to write you for most of the time. May the God 
of our fathers bless and save you all! 
</p><p>

<p>
Early in the morning of the 30th of August the enemy's scouts 
approached to within one mile and a half of the western boundary of 
the town of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a>. At this place my son Frederick (who was 
not attached to my force) had lodged, with some four other young 
men from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, and a young man named Garrison, from Middle 
Creek. The scouts, led by a proslavery preacher named White, 
shot my son dead in the road, while he as I have since ascertained supposed them to be friendly. At the same time they 
butchered Mr. Garrison, and badly mangled one of the young men 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, who came with my son, leaving him for dead. 
This was not far from sunrise. I had stopped during the night 
about two and one half miles from them, and nearly one mile from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a>. I had no organized force, but only some twelve or 
fifteen new recruits, who were ordered to leave their preparations for 
breakfast and follow me into the town, as soon as this news was 
brought to me. 
</p><p>
As I had no means of learning correctly the force of the enemy, 
I placed twelve of the recruits in a log-house, hoping we might be 
able to defend the town. I then gathered some fifteen more men 
together, whom we armed with guns; and we started in the direction of the enemy. After going a few rods we could see them 
approaching the town in line of battle, about half a mile off, upon 
a hill west of the village. I then gave up all idea of doing more 
than to annoy, from the timber near the town, into which we 
were all retreated, and which was filled with a thick growth of 
underbrush ; but I had no time to recall the twelve men in the log- 
house, and so lost their assistance in the fight. At the point above 
named I met with Captain Cline, a very active young man, who 
had with him some twelve or fifteen mounted men, and persuaded 
him to go with us into the timber, on the southern shore of the 
Osage, or Marais des Cygnes, a little to the northwest from the 
village. Here the men, numbering not more than thirty in all, 
were directed to scatter and secrete themselves as well as they could, 
and await the approach of the enemy. This was done in full view 
of them (who must have seen the whole movement), and had to be 
done in the utmost haste. I believe Captain Cline and some of his 
men were not even dismounted in the fight, but cannot assert positively. When the left wing of the enemy had approached to within 
common rifle-shot, we commenced firing, and very soon threw the 
northern branch of the enemy's line into disorder. This continued 
some fifteen or twenty minutes, which gave us an uncommon opportunity to annoy them. Captain Cline and his men soon got out of 
ammunition, and retired across the river. 
</p><p>
After the enemy rallied we kept up our fire, until, by the leaving 
of one and another, we had but six or seven left. We then retired 
across the river. We had one man killed a Mr. Powers, from 
Captain Cline's company in the fight. One of my men, a Mr. Partridge, was shot in crossing the river. Two or three of the 
party who took part in the fight are yet missing, and may be lost or 
taken prisoners. Two were wounded ; namely, Dr. Updegraff and a 
Mr. Collis. I cannot speak in too high terms of them, and of many others I have not now time to mention. 
</p><p>
One of my best men, together with myself, was struck by a partially spent ball from the enemy, in the commencement of the fight, 
but we were only bruised. The loss I refer to is one of my missing 
men. The loss of the enemy, as we learn by the different statements of our own as well as their people, was some thirty-one or 
two killed, and from forty to fifty wounded. After burning the 
town to ashes and killing a Mr. Williams they had taken, whom 
neither party claimed, they took a hasty leave, carrying their dead 
and wounded with them. They did not attempt to cross the river, 
nor to search for us, and have not since returned to look over their 
work. 
</p><p>
I give this in great haste, in the midst of constant interruptions. 
My second son was with me in the fight, and escaped unharmed. 
</p><p>
This I mention for the benefit of his friends. Old Preacher White, 
I hear, boasts of having killed my son. Of course he is a liar.

DEAR BROTHER AND SISTER ADAIR, It is a long time since I 
have heard a word from you, but I suppose it is because I have been 
continually shifting about since my return to the States. I am 
getting quite anxious to hear from you, and to get your views on 
your own prospects and present condition, together with your ideas 
of Governor Geary and of Kansas matters generally. I have not 
heard a word from Hudson or <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> since December ; but that is 
owing to the fact that I have had no place fixed upon, till of late, 
where to receive letters. This has been from a kind of necessity ; 
but I can now say, do write me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a>, Mass., care of the 
Massasoit House, leaving the title of Captain off. I now expect to 
go to Kansas (quietly) before long ; but I do not wish it noised 
about at all. Can you tell me what has become of Captain Holmes 
of your place? I expect to appear before a committee of the Massachusetts legislature in a day or two. My family were well about a 
week ago. Your affectionate brother,

DEAR WIFE, I enclose with this a letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met">Owen</a>, written 
me from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>. He appeared to be very much depressed before he left me ; but there was no possible misunderstanding between us that 
I knew of. I did not pay Samuel Thompson all that I ought to have 
given him for carrying us out, and wish you would make it up to 
him, if you can well, out of what I have sent you. If you get hay 
of him, I will send or fetch the money soon to pay for it. I shall 
send you some newspapers soon to let you see what different stories 
are told of me. None of them tell things as I tell them. Write me,

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN ALL, I have just got a letter from 
John. All middling well, March 2, but Johnny, who has the ague 
by turns. I now enclose another from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met">Owen</a>. I sent you some 
papers last week. Have just been speaking for three nights at Can 
ton, Conn., and at Collinsville, a village of that town. At the two 
places they gave me eighty dollars. Canton is where both father 
and mother were raised. They have agreed to send to my family at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=north elba" rel="city">North Elba</a>, grandfather John Brown's old granite monument, about 
eighty years old, to be faced and inscribed in memory of our poor 
Frederick, who sleeps in Kansas. 1 I prize it very highly, and the 
family all will, I think. I want to see you all very much, but can 
not tell when I can go back yet. Hope to get something from you 
here soon. Direct as before. May God bless you all! 
Your affectionate husband and father. 
</p><p>
Mr. Bust, to whom the next letters were written, says 
that he had a " store " at Collinsville in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1857">1857</a>, and John 
Brown was there in April, showing to various persons the 
bowie-knife that he captured with Pate in Kansas. As he 
did so, Brown said : " Such a blade as this, mounted upon a 
strong shaft, or handle, would make a cheap and effective 
weapon. Our friends in Kansas are without arms or money to get them ; and if I could put such weapons into their 
hands, they could make them very useful. A resolute woman, with such a pike, could defend her cabin door against 
man or beast. What can such a weapon be made for? " Mr. Rust guessed for a dollar each, in quantity. " Very well," 
said Brown ; " I would be glad to pay that price for a 
thousand ; " and it was agreed that Mr. Rust should try to 
get them made in Collinsville for that price, by Charles Blair. Mr. Rust further says : 
</p><p>
" During one of his visits I earned him to Canton to see his 
relatives. Not far from their house he noticed a tombstone leaning 
against the stone wall by the roadside. He got out and examined it, 
and found it to be his grandfather's ; whereupon he said, I will go 
back and see if my cousins will let me have it. They consented, 
and afterwards brought it to me at Collinsville ; and I sent it to his 
address at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=north elba" rel="city">North Elba</a>,. That stone/ said he, formerly marked 
the grave of my grandfather, who died fighting for the liberties of 
his country ; my son has just been murdered in the same cause in 
Kansas, and the Government applauded the murderer. This stone 
shall bear his name also ; and I will have it set up at North Elba. "

one or two navy-sized revolvers as soon as may be, together with his 
best cash terms (he warranting them) by the hundred with good 
moulds, flasks, etc. I wish the sample pistols sent to John (not

DEAR WIFE, Your letter of the 21st is just received. I have 
only to say as regards the resolution of the boys to " learn and practice war no more/ that it was not at my solicitation that they en

DEAR BROTHER AND SISTER ADAIR, I received Mr. Adair's 
most welcome letter to-day, and am greatly obliged for it indeed. I 
also yesterday saw your letter to Mr. Burt, at Canton, Conn. Mr. 
Burt died in January. In him truth, right, and humanity lost a 
faithful friend. I have but a moment to write, and but little to say 
that would afford you any interest, except that friends are well, so far 
as I know, and that I think of going West somewhere, soon. The 
excitement is getting up this way in view of Supreme Court proceedings, 1 Walker's appointment as governor of Kansas, etc. May 
God still preserve and keep you all!

MY DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 15th March, and that of friend Holmes of the 16th, I have just received. I cannot express my gratitude for them both. They give me just that kind of news I was most 
of all things anxious to hear. I bless God that he has not left the 
Free-State men of Kansas to pollute themselves by the foul and 
loathsome embrace of the old rotten whore. I have been trembling 
all along lest they might u back down " from the high and holy 
ground they had taken. I say, in view of the wisdom, firmness, and 
patience of my friends and fellow- sufferers in the cause of humanity, 
let God's name be eternally praised! I would most gladly give my 
hand to all whose u garments are not defiled ; " and I humbly trust 
that I shall soon again have opportunity to rejoice (or suffer further 
if need be) with you in the strife between heaven and hell. I wisli 
to send my most cordial and earnest salutation to every one of the 
chosen. My efforts this way have not been altogether fruitless. I 
wish you and friend Holmes both to accept this for the moment ; may 
write soon again, and hope to hear from you both at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tabor" rel="city">Tabor</a>, Fremont

</p><p>
your earnest and early attention to my wants and those of my family. 
I regret that Mr. Huunewell did not at once send me either a check 
or a draft on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> or <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, as it will probably be one mouth 
or more before I can realize it ; and I have not the means of paying 
my board bill here, not having as yet received anything from Mr. Whitman toward a balance of five hundred "dollars, nor heard from 
him. If I get the money from Mr. Hunnewell and Mr. Whitman, it 
will answer my present wants, except the secret service I wrote you 
about. I have all the arms I am likely to need, but am destitute 
of saddle-bags or knapsacks, holsters and belts ; have only a few 
blankets, no shovels or spades, no mattocks, but three or four adzes 
(ought to have been one hundred), and am nearly destitute of cook 
ing utensils. The greater part of what I have just named I must do 
without till another spring, at any rate. I found here one brass 
field-piece complete, and one damaged gun-carriage, with some am 
munition suitable for it j some seventy to seventy-five old damaged 
United States rifles and muskets, one dozen old sabres, some powder 
and lead (enough for present use; weight not known), I suppose 
sent by National Committee. Also one dozen boxes and barrels of 
clothing, boots, etc., with three hand gristmills, sent to Nebraska 
City, from same source. I also got from Dr. Jesse Bo wen, of Iowa 
City, one old wagon, which broke down with a light load on the 
way; also nine full-rigged tents, three sets tent-poles (additional), 
eleven pairs blankets, and three axes, sent there by National Committee. Also from Mr. Kurd I got an order for fifty dollars worth 
of tents, wagon-covering, ropes, etc., at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">Chicago</a>, which was paid 
me. I find one hundred and ninety-four carbines, about thirty-three 
hundred ball cartridges, all the primers, but no iron ladles. This, I 
believe, with the teams and wagon I purchased, will give you a pretty 
good idea of the stuff I have. I had a gun and pair of pistols given 
me by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=sgh" rel="met friend colleague">Dr. Howe</a>, and some three or four guns made for experiment 
by Mr. Thayer (a little cannon and carriage is one of them), and one 
nice rifle by the manufacturing company at Worcester. 1 I had also 
a few revolvers, common guns, and sabres left on hand, that I took 
on with me in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1855">1855</a>. While waiting here T and my son have been 
trying to learn a little of the arts of peace from Colonel F., who is 
still with us. That is the school I alluded to. 
</p><p>
Before I reached here, T had written particularly to friends in 
Kansas, saying that I wanted help to meet me here, and to wait for 
me should I be detained on the way. I also arranged with Mr. Whitman in regard to it in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">Chicago</a>. He sent one man with one 
hundred and fifty dollars ; forty of it he kept, and went immediately 
back. From that time I send you copies of some of the correspondence between Kansas and me, as rather essential to give you a 
correct idea of things in connection with my statements yet to be 
made. When I got on here I immediately wrote Mr. Whitman 
and several others what was my situation and wants. He (Mr. Whitman) has not written me at all since what I send. Others 
have written, as you will see. I wrote the man Mr. Whitman 
sent me, among the rest, but get no word from him since what I 
now send. 
</p><p>
As to the policy of voting on Monday next, I think Lane hit his 
mark at the convention of Grasshopper s, if never before; I mean 
An escape into the filthy sluice of a prison." I had not been able 
to learn by papers or otherwise distinctly what course had been taken 
in Kansas till within a few days; and probably the less I have to 
say, the better. 
</p><p>
I omitted above to say that I paid out five hundred and fifty dollars on a contract for one thousand superior pikes, as a cheap but 
effectual weapon to place in the hands of entirely unskilful and unpractised men, which will not easily get out of order, and require no 
ammunition. They will cost, handles and all complete, a little short 
of one dollar each. That contract I have not been able to fulfil ; and 
wise military men may ridicule the idea; but "I take the whole 
responsibility of that job," so that I can only get them. 
</p><p>
On hearing that Lane had come into Nebraska, I at once sent a 
young man with a line, saying I had been hurt, and was exceedingly 
anxious to see him early in September. To this he sent me no reply, 
unless Redpath's letter be one. I am now so far recovered from my 
hurt as to be able to do a little ; and foggy as it is, " we do not give 
up the ship." I will not say that Kansas, watered by the tears arid 
blood of my children, shall yet be free or I fall. I intend at once to 
put the supplies I have in a secure place, and then to put myself and 
such as may go with me where we may get more speedy communi 
cations, and can wait until we know better how to act than we now 
do. I send this whole package to you, thinking Concord a less offensive name just now than <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> at this end of the route. I wish the 
whole conveyed to my friend <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ges" rel="friend colleague met">Stearns</a> and other friends, as old Brown's 
last report. 
</p><p>
Until further advised, I wish all communications addressed to Jonas 
Jones, Esq., <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tabor" rel="city">Tabor</a>, Fremont County, Iowa, outwardly ; and I hope 
you will all write often. 
</p><p>
I had forgotten to say, that day before yesterday one single man, 
with no team at all, came from Lane to have me start at once for 
Kansas, as you will see by copies. He said he had left ten fine 
fellows about thirty miles back. The names he gave me were all strange to me, as well as himself. Tabor folks (some of them) 
speak slightingly of him, notwithstanding that he too is a general.

land lies. You will hear again soon.

MY DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 7th inst. is received. I had 
previously written you expressive of my strong desire to see you. I 
suppose you have my letter before this. As to the job of work you

DEAR SIR, Please send me by Mr. Charles P. Tidd what money 
you have for me, not papers. He is the second man I have sent in order to get the means of taking me through. General Lane sent a 
man who got here without any team, with but fifty dollars of Lane's 
money (as he said, which I returned to him, and wanted me to start 
right off, with only four days time to load up and drive through before 
this bogus election day, which my state of health and the very wet 
weather rendered it impossible to do in time; and I did not think it 
right to start from here under such circumstances. Do try to make 
me up the money, all in good shape, before Mr. Tidd returns, and 
also write me everything you know about the aspect of things in 
Kansas. Please furnish Mr. Tidd with a horse to take him to Osawatornie, and greatly oblige me. The fifty dollars Lane sent was 
only about enough to pay up my board bill here, with all I had on 
hand. I need not say my disappointments have been extreme.

DEAR CHILDREN, I received your letter of the 6th and 8th inst. 
Will endeavor to get the article Ruth wrote for. I now expect to

MY DEAR SIR, ... In regard to the security you mention, 
for being responsible for Colonel Carter, I will say, it is most reason 
able ; but as I deem it most uncertain what will become of things I 
carry into the war, and as I need arms " more than I do bread," I 
propose not to draw on you for the amount named, thirteen hundred dollars, and will not. 
</p><p>
This, I trust, will be entirely satisfactory to you, and a vastly better security. I am exceeding glad of the arrangement with Colonel 
Carter, whom I have written. I leave here for the West to-day, 
with health some improved, and shall be much gratified with getting 
a line from you, addressed to Orson M. Oviatt, Esq., <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a>, 
Ohio. Please remember me to Mrs. S., family, and other friends;

</p><p>
The allusion above is to the generous offer of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ges" rel="friend colleague met">Mr. Stearns</a> 
to guarantee the payment for two hundred revolvers, made 
by him in these letters of May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1857">1857</a> : 
</p><p>
May 4. I have written to Colonel Carter that I will be responsible for the payment of thirteen hundred dollars for two hundred 
revolvers, as you propose, and have requested him to write to you if he accepts my proposal. 1 If be does not, I will write to you again. 
If I pay for these revolvers, I shall expect that all the arms and ammunition, rifles as well as revolvers, not used for the defence of 
Kansas, shall be held as pledged to me for the payment of this 
amount. To this our committee have assented by a vote passed on 
Saturday, and I have no doubt you will assent to it. If you do not, 
let me know your reasons. 
</p><p>
May 6. I think you ought to go to Kansas as soon as possible, 
and give Robinson and the rest some backbone. 
</p><p>
May 11. I am glad to know that you are on your way to Kansas : 
the Free- State, leaders need somebody to talk to them. I hope you 
will see Con way very soon after your arrival. I did not expect you 
to return, or hold pledged to me, any arms you used in Kansas, but 
only such as were not used.

Truly yours,

Some days since, while on my way home [to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=north elba" rel="city">North Elba</a>,, N. Y.], 
sick with fever and ague, I got your favor of the 29th April, saying, 
11 Mr. Lawrence has agreed with me that the one thousand dollars 
shall he made up, and will write to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Gerrit Smith</a> to-day or to-mor 
row, to say that he can depend on the money from him." After 
getting home I agreed with two young men (by the name of Thompson) who had bargained with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Mr. Smith</a> for the farm several years ago, and paid him in part for it, and who had made the 
improvements on it, that I would take the farm, pay the balance 
due <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Mr. Smith</a> (some two hundred dollars), and the remainder, 
about eight hundred dollars, to them; which would enable them 
to pay for another farm which they had before bought of a Mr. 
Lawton, and were unable to pay for. Three days ago one of these 
men set out for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=peterboro" rel="city">Peterboro</a> (the home of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Gerrit Smith</a>) to meet 
me there, on my way West, and have the thing completed. I 
will now say (" frankly," as you suggest) that I must ask to have 
the one thousand dollars made up at once and forwarded to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Gerrit Smith</a>. I did not start the measure of getting up any subscription 
for me (although I was sufficiently needy, as God knows), nor had

Your most kind letter of the 26th of April I did not get till 
within the last two or three days, and then I was on my way 
West, full of cares, and in feeble health. I have just written my 
friend Steams a letter of explanation, in which I frankly ask that 
the one thousand dollars donation I was so generously encouraged 
to expect for the permanent assistance of my wife and children be, 
under the circumstances as so explained, promptly raised. This, 
I think, much the cheapest and most proper way to provide for 
them, and far less humiliating to my wife, who, though not above 
getting her bread over the washtub, will never tell her trials or her 
wants to the world. This I know by the experience of the past two 
years, while I was absent ; but I would never utter a syllable in regard to it, were I not conscious that I am performing that service 
which is equally the duty of millions, who need not forego a single 
hearty dinner by the efforts they are called on to make. I did not 
mean to burden my friends <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ges" rel="friend colleague met">Stearns</a> and Lawrence further with the

MY DEAR SIR, On my arrival at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> yesterday, I found 
with 0. M. Oviatt, Esq., your favors of the 16th and 19th iust. I 
had made no previous arrangement with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Mr. Smith</a> about the land, 
other than to say that I wanted the contract with the Thompsons 
made over to me on payment, or to that effect. He had given me no 
encouragement of any help about it from him ; and when I met one 
of the Thompsons there, 1 all I could do was to get both parties to 
agree to the arrangement, and to wait until the money could get on 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Mr. Smith</a> had before written me that his last year's 
efforts for Kansas had embarrassed him, but that when the struggle 
was renewed he would do all he could. He gave me fifty dollars, 
Mrs. S. ten dollars and some little useful articles ; <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=peterboro" rel="city">Peterboro</a> friends 
gave me thirty-one dollars, and I came on with the understanding 
that probably the thousand dollars would soon be sent on to Mr. 
Smith. I lost about one week on my way to my family with ague 
and fever, and left home feeble, and am still so. I could promise 
Colonel Carter no more than pay for primings, which I had not bar 
gained for. I shall redeem my promise to you as soon as I am able to do so. Please write me next to Dr. Jesse Bo wen, Iowa City, 
Iowa, on envelope. I send my earnest good wishes to Mrs. S. and 
the children. Am disappointed in not having Mr. Foster and child 
for company.

MY DEAR SIR, In consequence of ill-health and other hindrances too numerous and unpleasant to write about, the least of 
which has not been the lack of sufficient means for freight bills and 
other expenses, I have never as yet returned to Kansas. This has 
been unavoidable-, unless I returned without securing the principal 
object for which I came back from the Territory ; and I am now 
waiting for teams and means to come from there to enable me to go 
on. I obtained two teams and wagons, as I talked of, at a cost of 
seven hundred and eighty-six dollars, but was obliged to hire a 
teamster and to drive one team myself. This unexpected increase of 
labor, together with being much of the time quite unwell and de 
pressed with disappointments and delays, has prevented my writing 
sooner. Indeed, I had pretty much determined not to write till I 
should do it from Kansas. I will tell you some of my disappointments. I was flattered with the expectation of getting one thousand 
dollars from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hartford" rel="city">Hartford</a> City and also one thousand dollars from New 
Haven. From <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hartford" rel="city">Hartford</a> I did get about two hundred and sixty dol 
lars, and a little over in some repair of arms. From New Haven I 
got twenty- five dollars; at any rate, that is all I can get any advice 
of. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Gerrit Smith</a> supplied me with three hundred and fifty dollars, or I could not have reached this place. He also loaned me one hundred and ten dollars to pay to the Thompsons who were disappointed 
of getting their money for the farm I had agreed for and got posses 
sion of for use. I have been continually hearing from them that I 
have not fulfilled, and that I told them I should not leave the country 
till the thing was completed. This has exceedingly mortified me. I 
could tell you much more had I room and time. Have not given up. 
Will write more when I get to Kansas.

Much as I love to communicate with you, it is still a great burden 
for me to write when I have nothing of interest to say, and when 
there is something to be active about. Since I left New England I 
have had a good deal of ill-health ; and having in good measure exhausted my available means toward purchasing such supplies as I 
should certainly need if again called into active service, and without 
which I could accomplish next to nothing, I had to begin my journey back with not more than half money at any time to bear my 
expenses through and pay my freights. This being the case, I was 
obliged to stop at different points on the way, and to go to others off 
the route to solicit help. At most places I raised a little ; but it 
consumed my time, and my unavoidable expenses so nearly kept 
pace with my incomes that I found it exceedingly discouraging. 
With the help of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Gerrit Smith</a>, who supplied me with sixty dollars 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=peterboro" rel="city">Peterboro</a> , and two hundred and fifty dollars at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">Chicago</a>, and 
other smaller amounts from others, I was able to pay freights and 
other expenses to this place; hiring a man to drive one team, and 
driving another myself; and had about twenty-five dollars on hand, 
with about one hundred dollars worth of provisions, when I reached 
here. Among all the good friends who had promised to go with me, 
not one could I get to stick by me and assist me on my way through. 
I have picked up, at different times on the way, considerable value 
in articles (indispensable in active service) which were scattered on 
the way, and had been provided either by or for the National Committee. On reaching here I found one hundred and ten dollars, sent 
me by Mr. Whitman, from sale of articles in Kansas, sent there by 
the National Committee. This is all the money I have got from 
them on their appropriation at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. On the road one of my 
horses hurt himself so badly that I lost about ten days in consequence, not being in condition to go on without him, or to buy or to 
hire another. I find the arms and ammunition voted me by the 
Massachusetts State Committee nearly all here, and in middling good 
order, some a little rusted. Have overhauled and cleaned up the 
worst of them, and am now waiting to know what is best to do 
next, or for a little escort from Kansas, should I arid the supplies be 
needed. I am now at last within a kind of hailing distance of our 
Free-State friends in Kansas. 
</p><p>
On the way from Iowa City I and my third son (the hired man I 
mentioned), in order to make the little funds we had reach as far as 
possible, and to avoid notice, lived exclusively on herring, soda 
crackers, and sweetened water for more than three weeks (sleeping 
every night in our wagons), except that twice we got a little milk, 
and a few times some boiled- eggs. Early in the season, in consequence of the poor encouragement I met with, and of their own 
losses and sufferings, my sons declined to return ; and my wife wrote 
me as follows : " The boys have all determined both to practise and 
learn war no more." This I said nothing about, lest it should pre 
vent my getting any further supplies. After leaving New England 
I could not get the scratch of a pen to tell whether anything had 
been deposited at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hartford" rel="city">Hartford</a>, from New Haven and other places, for 
me or not; until, since I came here, a line comes from Mr. Callender, 
dated 24th July, saying nothing has been deposited, in answer to 
one I had written June 22, in, which he further says he has answered all my letters. The parting with my wife and young uneducated children, without income, supplies of clothing, provisions, or 
even a comfortable house to live in, or money to provide such things, 
with at least a fair chance that it was to be a last and final separation, had lain heavily on me, and was about as much a matter of self- 
sacrifice and self-devotion on the part of my wife as on my own, and 
about as much her act as my own. When Mr. Lawrence, of his 
own accord, proposed relieving me on that score, it greatly eased a 
burdened spirit ; but I did not rely upon it absolutely, nor make any 
certain bargain on the strength of it, until after being positively as 
sured by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ges" rel="friend colleague met">Mr. Stearns</a>, in writing, that it should, and by yourself that 
it would, certainly be done. 
</p><p>
It was the poor condition of my noble-hearted wife and of her 
young children that made me follow up that encouragement with a 
tenacity that disgusted him and completely exhausted his patience. 
But after such repeated assurances from friends I so much respected 
that I could not suspect they would trifle with my feelings, I made 
a positive bargain for the farm ; and when I found nothing for 
me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=peterboro" rel="city">Peterboro</a> , I borrowed ono hundred and ten dollars of Mr. 
Smith for the men who occupied the farm, tilling him it would certainly be refunded, and the others that they would get all their 
money very soon, and even before I left the country. This has 
brought me only extreme mortification and depression of feeling; 
for all my letters from home, up to the last, say not a dime has 
been paid in to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Mr. Smith</a>. Friends who never know the lack of 
a sumptuous dinner little comprehend the value of such trilling 
matters to persons circumstanced as I am. But, my noble-hearted 
friend, I am " though faint, yet pursuing." My health lias been 
much better of late. I believe my anxiety and discouragements 
had something to do with repeated returns of fever and ague I have 
had, as it tended to deprive me of sleep and to debilitate me. I 
intend this letter as a kind of report of my progress and success, as 
much for your committee or my friend <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ges" rel="friend colleague met">Stearns</a> as yourself. I have 
been joined by a friend since I got here, and get no discouraging 
news from Kansas. Your friend,

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, I have just received

from Mr. Day. We are very glad to learn that all were well so 
lately ; and I am pleased to discover that Mr. Day is willing I 
should pay Henry, if I have any funds of his in my hands. This I 
shall certainly try to do, should that prove to be the case. I do not

papers left by me last fall in my old chest with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met">Owen</a>. Shall try 
to do that soon. I wrote home from here week before last, on Saturday. Since then we have been waiting either for news or for a small 
escort of men and teams to go with us. We get no special news 
from the West as yet. We are beginning to take lessons, and have 
(we think) a very capable teacher. Should no disturbance occur, 
we may possibly think best to work back eastward ; I cannot deter 
mine yet. I hope you will continue to write me here till I say to 
you where else; and I want you to give me all the particulars concerning your welfare. God bless you all!

DEAR SON JOHN, Forbes's letter to me of the 27th of January I 
enclose back to you, and will be glad to have you return it to him with 
something like the following (unless you can think of some serious 
objection), as I am anxious to draw him out more fully, and would 
also like to keep him a little encouraged and avoid an open rupture 
for a few weeks, at any rate. Suppose you write Forbes thus : 
</p><p>
" Your letter to my father, of 27th January, after mature reflection, I have decided to return to you, as I am unwilling he should, 
with all his other cares, difficulties, and trials, be vexed with what I 
am apprehensive he will accept as highly offensive and insulting, 
while I know that he is disposed to do all he consistently can for 
you, and will do so, unless you are yourself the cause of his disgust. 
I was trying to send you a little assistance myself, say about forty 
dollars ; but I must hold up till I feel different from what I now do. 
I understood from my father that he had advanced you already six 
hundred dollars, or six months pay (disappointed as he has been), 
to enable you to provide for your family ; and that he was to give 
you one hundred dollars per month for just so much time as you continued in his service. Now, you in your letter undertake to instruct 
him to say that he had positively engaged you for one year. I fear he 
will not accept it well to he asked or told to state what he considers 
an untruth. Again, I suspect you have greatly mistaken the man, 
if you suppose he will take it kindly in you, or any living man, to 
assume to instruct him how he should conduct his own business and 
correspondence. And I suspect that the seemingly spiteful letters 
you say you have written to some of his particular friends have not 
only done you great injury, but also weakened his hands with them. 
While I have, in my poverty, deeply sympathized with you and 
your family, who, I ask, is likely to be moved by any exhibition of 
a wicked and spiteful temper on your part, or is likely to be dictated 
to by you as to their duties? 
</p><p>
I ask you to look over your letter again. You begin with saying, With a little energy, all will yet be right. Is that respectful? 
and does it come with a good grace from you to the man you thus 
address? Look it all over ; and if, after having done so, you wish 
him to have it, go on! you can do so. But as a friend I would 
advise a very different course." 
</p><p>
As I conclude Forbes does not hold you as deeply committed to 
him, he may listen to you ; and I hope he will. I want to see how 
a sharp but well-merited rebuke will affect him ; and should it have 
the desired effect, I would like to get a draft for forty dollars, pay 
able to his order, and remit him at once. I do not mean to dictate to you, as he does to me ; but I am anxious to understand him 
fully before we go any further, and shall be glad of the earliest 
information of the result. . . . 
</p><p>
Your affectionate father,

MY DEAR SIR, I am again out of Kansas, and am at this time 
concealing my whereabouts ; but for very different reasons, however, 
from those I had for doing so at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> last spring. I have nearly 
perfected arrangements for carrying out an important measure in 
which the world has a deep interest, as well as Kansas ; and only 
lack from five to eight hundred dollars to enable me to do so, the 
same object for which I asked for secret-service money last fall. It 
is my only errand here j and I have written to some of our mutual 
friends in regard to it, but they none of them understand my views 
so well as you do, and I cannot explain without their first committing 
themselves more than I know of their doing. I have heard that 
Parker Pillsbury and some others in your quarter hold out ideas 
similar to those on which I act ; but I have no personal acquaintance 
with them, and know nothing of their influence or means. Cannot 
you either by direct or indirect action do something to further me f 
Do you not know of some parties whom you could induce to give 
their abolition theories a thoroughly practical shape? I hope this 
will prove to be the last time I shall be driven to harass a friend in 
such a way. Do you think any of my Ganlsonian friends, either at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, Worcester, or any other place, can be induced to supply a 
little " straw/ if I will absolutely make u bricks"? I have written 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ges" rel="friend colleague met">George L. Stearns</a>, Esq., of Mcdford, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=fbs" rel="met friend colleague">Mr. F. B. Sanborn</a>, of 
Concord ; but I am not informed as to how deeply-dyed Abolitionists 
those friends are, and must beg you to consider this communication 
strictly confidential, unless you know of parties who will feel and 
act, and hold their peace. I want to bring the thing about during 
the next sixty days. Please write N. Hawkins, care William J. 
Watkins, Esq., Rochester, N. Y.

DEAR SON JOHN. I am here with our good friends <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Gerrit Smith</a> 
and wife, who, I am most happy to tell you, are ready to go in fur

in regard to this most encouraging fact, " My soul doth magnify the 
Lord." I seem to be almost marvellously helped ; and to His name 
be praise! I had to-day no particular thing to write, other than to 
let you share in my encouragement. I have been looking for a letter 
from you to be forwarded from Kochester ; and may get one to-day. 
When I get one, will write you further. I do not expect to remain

MY DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, I am (praised 
be God !) once more in York State. Whether I shall be permitted 
to visit you or not this winter or spring, I cannot now say ; but it is 
some relief of mind to feel that I am again so near you. Possibly, if one or more of you to meet me somewhere. The anxiety I feel to 
see my wife and children once more I am unable to describe. I want 
exceedingly to see my big baby and Ruth's baby, and to see how that 
little company of sheep look about this time. The cries of my poor 
sorrow-stricken despairing children, whose il tears on their cheeks " 
are ever in my eyes, and whose sighs are ever in my ears, may how 
ever prevent my enjoying the happiness I so much desire. But, 
courage, courage, courage! the great work of my life (the unseen 
Hand that u guided me, and who has indeed holden my right hand, 
may hold it still," though I have not known him at all as I ought) I 
may yet see accomplished (God helping), and be permitted to return, 
and u rest at evening." 
</p><p>
my daughter Ruth! could any plan be devised whereby you 
could let Henry go u to school " (as you expressed it in your letter to 
him while in Kansas), I would rather now have him " for another 
term " than to have a hundred average scholars. I have a particular 
and very important, but not dangerous, place for him to fill in the 
11 school," and I know of no man living so well adapted to fill it. I 
am quite confident some way can be devised so that you and your 
children could be with him, and be quite happy even, and safe ; but 
God forbid me to flatter you into trouble! I did not do it before. 
My dear child, could you face such music if, on a full explanation, 
Henry could be satisfied that his family might be safe f I would 
make a similar inquiry of my own dear wife ; but I have kept her 
tumbling here and there over a stormy and tempestuous sea for so 
many years that I cannot ask her such a question. The natural ingenuity of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=sab" rel="child met">Salmon</a> in connection with some experience he and Oliver 
have both had, would point him out as the next best man I could now 
select ; but I am dumb in his case, as also in the case of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a> and 
all my other sons. Jason's qualifications are, some of them, like 
Henry's also. 
</p><p>
Do not noise it about that I am in these parts, and direct to N. Hawkins, care of Frederick Douglass, Rochester, N. Y. I want to 
hear how you are all supplied with winter clothing, boots, etc. 
</p><p>
God bless you all!

MY DEAR WIFE, I received yours of the 17th of February yesterday ; was very glad of it, and to know that you had got the ten 
dollars safe. I am having a constant series of both great encouragements and discouragements, but am yet able to say, in view of all, 
" hitherto the Lord hath helped me." I shall send <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=sab" rel="child met">Salmon</a> some 
thing as soon as I can, and will try to get you the articles you mention. I find a much more earnest feeling among the colored people 
than ever before ; but that is by no means unusual. On the whole, 
the language of Providence to me would certainly seem to say, 
" Try on." I flatter myself that 1 may be able to go and see you 
again before a great while ; but I may not be able. I long to see 
you all. All were well with John and Jason a few days since. I

MY DEAR FRIEND, Mr. Morton has taken the liberty of saying 
to me that you felt half inclined to make a common cause with me. 
I greatly rejoice at this ; for I believe when you come to look at the 
ample field I labor in, and the rich harvest which not only this entire 
country but the whole world during the present and future generations may reap from its successful cultivation, you will feel that you 
are out of your element until you find you are in it, an entire unit. 
What an inconceivable amount of good you might so effect by your 
counsel, your example, your encouragement, your natural and acquired ability for active service! And then, how very little we can 
possibly lose! Certainly the cause is enough to live for, if not to for. I have only had this one opportunity, in a life of nearly sixty 
years ; and could I be continued ten times as long again, I might 
not again have another equal opportunity. God has honored but 
comparatively a very small part of mankind with any possible chance 
for such mighty and soul-satisfying rewards. But, my dear friend, 
if you should make up your mind to do so, I trust it will be wholly 
from the promptings of your own spirit, after having thoroughly 
counted the cost. I would Hatter no man into such a measure, if I 
could do it ever so easily. 
</p><p>
I expect nothing bat to " endure hardness ;" but I expect to effect 
a mighty conquest, even though it be like the last victory of Sam 
son. I felt for a number of years, in earlier life, a steady, strong 
desire to die : but since I saw any prospect of becoming a " reaper " 
in the great harvest, I have not only felt quite willing to live, but 
have enjoyed life much ; and am now rather anxious to live for a 
few years more. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR, Since you know I have an almost countless brood 
of poor hungry chickens to " scratch for," you will not reproach me 
for scratching even on the Sabbath. At any rate, I trust God will 
not. I want you to undertake to provide a substitute for an address 
you saw last season, directed to the officers and soldiers of the United 
States Army. The ideas contained in that address I of course like, 
for I furnished the skeleton. I never had the ability to clothe those 
ideas in language at all to satisfy myself; and I was by no means 
satisfied with the style of that address, and do not know as I can give 
any correct idea of what I want. I will, however, try. 
</p><p>
In the first place it must be short, or it will not be generally read. 
It must be in the simplest or plainest language, without the least 
affectation of the scholar about it, and yet be worded with great 
clearness and power. The anonymous writer must (in the language 
of the Paddy) be " afther others," and not " afther himself at all, at 
all." If the spirit that communicated Franklin's Poor Richard (or 
some other good spirit) would dictate, I tbink it would be quite as 
well employed as the " dear sister spirits" have been for some years 
past. The address should be appropriate, and particularly adapted 
to the peculiar circumstances we anticipate, and should look to the 
actual change of service from that of Satan to the service of God. It 
should be, in short, a most earnest and powerful appeal to men's 
sense of right and to their feelings of humanity. Soldiers are men, 
and no man can certainly calculate the value and importance of get 
ting a single " nail into old Captain Kidd's chest." It should be 
provided beforehand, and be ready in advance to distribute by all 
persons, male and female, who may be disposed to favor the right. 
</p><p>
I also want a similar short address, appropriate to the peculiar 
circumstances, intended for all persons, old and young, male and 
female, slaveholding and non-slaveholding, to be sent out broadcast 
over the entire nation. So by every male and female prisoner on 
being set at liberty, and to be read by them during confinement. I 
know that men will listen, and reflect too, under such circumstances. 
Persons will hear your autislavery. lectures and abolition lectures 
when they have become virtually slaves themselves. The impres 
sions made on prisoners by kindness and plain dealing, instead of 
barbarous and cruel treatment, such as they might give, and instead 
of being slaughtered like wild reptiles, as they might very naturally 
expect, are not only powerful but lasting. Females are susceptible 
of being carried away entirely by the kindness of an intrepid and 
magnanimous soldier, even when his bare name was but a terror the 
day previous. 1 Now, dear sir, I have told you about as well as I 
know how, what I am anxious at once to secure. Will you write 
the tracts, or get them written, so that I may commence colporteur? 
Very respectfully your friend, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">JOHN BROWN</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. If I should never see you again, please drop me a line 
(enclosed to Stephen Smith, Esq., Lombard Street, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>),

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, Since I wrote you 
I have thought it possible, though not probable, that some persons 
might be disposed to hunt for any property I may be supposed to 
possess, on account of liabilities I incurred while concerned with Mr. Perkins. Such claims I ought not to pay if I had ever so much 
given me for my service in Kansas, as most of you well know 1 
gave up all I then had to Mr. Perkins while with him. I think if 
Henry and Ruth have not yet made out a deed, as was talked of, 
they had better not do it at present, but merely sign a receipt I now send, which can be held by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a> ; and I also think that when the 
contract of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Gerrit Smith</a> with Franklin and Samuel Thompson is 
found, he had better lay it by carefully with the receipt, and that all 
the family had better decline saying anything about their land matters. Should any disturbance ever be made, it will most likely come 
directly or indirectly through a scoundrel by the name of Warren, 
w r ho defrauded Mr. Perkins and me out of several thousand dollars. 
He may set persons we suppose to be friends (who may, in fact, be 
so) to inquiring out matters. It can do no harm to decline saying 
much about such things; you can very properly say the land belongs 
to the family. 1 If a deed has been made by Henry and Ruth, it 
need not be recorded at present. I expect to leave for Iowa in a few 
days ; write me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">Chicago</a>, directing to Jason Brown, care of John

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, We start from here

You can divide it among the different branches of the family so as to 
make all as comfortable as may be. If I should not be able to send 
you money to pay the freight, you can perhaps sell some of it to 
some of your neighbors for cash, and pay the freight in that way. 
I shall try to send you some pork and leather soon. I am trying to 
arrange so as to have Henry come out to see me at Pennsylvania 
with Oliver (and any others), if it can be consistently done. I shall 
write Oliver and any others when and where to find us, and also 
provide about travelling expenses. They will not probably be called

April 22, enclosing lines from Forbes, with printed slips attached. 
It seems now, by what we can learn, that his management may 
occasion some hindrance j that being the case, you at home will have 
the more time to prepare, and will wait for further advice in the 
matter. It would seem as though F. has a correspondent some 
where. Can it be at Lindenville or <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>? I wish John 
would think over the matter, and see if he can get any light on the 
subject, and write me, enclosing what F. has lately written him, 
and also the substance of what he has lately written F. I suspect 
some one in Dr. McCune Smith's confidence is furnishing F. with 
information. It must be traced out, and the utmost care observed in 
doing it, as well as prudence exercised in all that is said, written, or 
done. I shall write you as often as I can, and shall assist you all I 
can. I cannot say what either flour or pork will be worth when 
you get them ; you can easily find that out when you have them. 
Shall send you more money as soon as I can. It may be best to sell 
off much of the flour. I expect to leave here shortly, but I want to 
hear from you right away. Enclose in a sealed envelope, the outer 
one directed to James M. Bell, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chatham" rel="city">Chatham</a>, as above. Was very glad 
to hear from Ellen. May God bless and finally save you all! Had 
a good Abolition convention here r from different^ parts , on the 8th 
and 10th hist. Constitution slightly amended and adopted, and society organized. Great unanimity prevailed. I hope you may be 
able to get the old granite monument home this summer.

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, Oliver's letter of 
the 19th is just received. I have to commend him for his promptitude in replying to mine, as well as the comprehensiveness, brevity, 
and spirit of that reply. We are completely nailed down at present, 
for want of funds j and we may be obliged to remain inactive for 
months yet, for the same reason. You must all learn to be patient, 
or, at least, I hope you will. If you have not been obliged to 
use the two drafts (amount, twenty-five dollars) before you get this, 
do try and hold them till I write you further. I have heard nothing 
from John since in March, and feel quite anxious on his account. 
You need not reply till further advised.

MY DEAR SIR, Your much -prized letter of the 10th inst. is received. I have only time to say at this moment that as it is an invariable rule with me to be governed by circumstances, or, in other words, 
not to do anything while I do not know what to do, none of our friends 
need have any fears in relation to hasty or rash steps being taken by 
us. As knowledge is said to be power, we propose to become possessed of more knowledge. We have many reasons for begging our 
Eastern friends to keep clear of F. personally, unless he throws him 
self upon them. We have those who are thoroughly posted up to put 
on his track, and we beg to be allowed to do so. We also beg our 
friends to supply us with three or four hundred dollars without delay, 
pledging ourselves not to act other than to secure perfect knowledge 
of facts in regard^ to what F. has really done, or will do, so that we 
may ourselves know how we ought to act. None of us here or with 
you should be hasty, or decide the course to be taken, "while under 
excitement. " In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall 
direct thy paths." A good cause is sure to be safe in the hands of 
an all-good, all-wise, and all-powerful Director and Father. Dear 
Sir, please send this to the friends at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> and Worcester at once ; 
and in the mean time send me on a plain copy of all that F. may 
hereafter write and say. The copy, together with fifteen dollars, 
is received. Direct all communications on outside envelope to 
James M. Bell, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chatham" rel="city">Chatham</a>, Canada West ; the inside, sealed, to Jason Brown. 
</p><p>
Yours ever. 
(No signature.) 
</p><p>
P. S. You can say with perfect truth to F. that you do not know 
what has become of me ; and you might ask him when he last heard 
from me, and where I was at the time.

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, ALL, I received Henry's letter 
of the 21st July a long time ago, but was too sick to answer it at 
the time, and have been ever since till now. I am still very weak, 
but gaining pretty well. I was never any more sick. I left the 
Missouri line about six weeks since ; soon after, T was taken down. 
Things are now very quiet, so far as I know. What course I shall 
next take, I cannot tell, till I have more strength. I have learned 
with pain that the flour did not go on, and shall try to send you some 
money instead of it, so that Mr. Allen may be well paid for the barrel he lent. I can write you no more now, but I want to know how 
you all get along. Enclose everything to Augustus Wattles, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=moneka" rel="city">Moneka</a>, Linn County, Kansas, in sealed envelope, with my name only on it. 
God bless you all!

DEAR WIFE, Your letter of the 25th August I was most glad 
to get, notwithstanding it told me of your trials ; and 1 would be 
thankful that the same hand that brought me your letter brought me 
another, supplying me with the means of sending you some relief. I 
hope you will all learn to put your trust in God, and not become discouraged when you meet with poor success and with losses. I wrote 
you two or three days ago, telling you how I had been sick, but was 
getting better. I am still very weak, and write with great labor. I 
enclose draft for fifty dollars, payable to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a>. I want Mr. Allen 
paid out of it, to his full satisfaction, for the barrel of flour lent, as a 
first thing, and the balance used to supply substantial comforts for 
the family, or to pay any little debts. I shall have the means, after a 
while, of paying for another yoke of oxen, and I hope to have it soon; 
but of that I cannot be certain. It would be well to make consider 
able inquiry for a good, youngish yoke, without faults, and also to 
find where you can get them most reasonably for the money. Do 
not, any of you, go in debt for a team. You may, perhaps, hire a 
few days work of some good team to log with, or of some good man 
to help to pile logs without a team, and I will endeavor to send the pay 
on for that soon. Do the best you can, and neither be hasty nor discouraged. You must acknowledge the receipt of this at once, and 
tell me all how you get along. May God abundantly bless you all!

Your affectionate husband.

now see no good reason why I should not be located nearer home, as 
soon as I can collect the means for defraying expenses. I still intend 
sending you some further help as soon as I can. Will write you how 
to direct to me hereafter. No more now.

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, ALL, I have just written to John 
H. Painter, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springdale" rel="city">Springdale</a>, Cedar County, Iowa, to send you a New 
York draft, payable to Oliver. I have strong hopes of your getting 
one to the amount of his note. At any rate, it is all the means I now 
have of giving you a little further help. Should you get it, you need 
not send him the note, as my letter is good against the note. I would 
be glad to have you pay the taxes, if you can so manage as to do it and 
be comfortable. I shall do all I can to help you, and as fast as I can. 
How soon I shall be able to see you again, I cannot tell, but I still 
live in hopes. I cannot now tell you how to direct to me, but will 
advise you further as soon as I can. Things at this moment look

DEAR FRIENDS, Your letter of the 10th October from Hudson 
was received in good time, but I was not then in a condition to reply 
at once. Things at this moment look rather threatening in this im 
mediate neighborhood ; but what will come up I cannot say. I am 
obliged to you for your efforts to prevent <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a> from going to California, and will try to express my gratitude by hinting to you that a 
business and copartnership, such as you allude to, would be very likely 
to require a good deal of the capital (real or fictitious) of others, whereby you would be likely to run into debt, and into some other entanglements. Could you not do moderately well by taking a dairy again? 
That business has for the last half century been subject to as few 
fluctuations in Ohio as any other (I think). Beside that, I suppose 
you already understand it, tolerably well at least. I may take wholly 
a wrong view of the subject. My health is some improved, but I am 
still weak. Shall write to you where to direct when I know where 
to do so.

May God bless you all! Your friend.

</p><p>
DEAR CHILDREN, I have a moment to write you, and I hasten 
to improve it. My health is some improved since I wrote you last, 
but still I get a shake now and then. Other friends are middling 
well, I believe. In some of the border counties south, there is the 
worst feeling at this time, which affords but little prospect of quiet. 
Other portions of the Territory are comparatively undisturbed. The 
winter may be supposed to have fairly set in, which may compel 
parties to defer hostilities at least. I want you to write my family to 
inquire particularly whether they are so circumstanced as to be able 
to get through the winter without suffering, so that I may hear from 
them when I know where to have you direct to me. I have but this 
moment returned from the south, and expect to go back at once. 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend. 
</p><p>
P. S. Am still preparing for my other journey. Yours. 
</p><p>
P. S. I want you, some of you, for the present, to write John, 
saying all about the condition of your different families, and whether 
you are suffering for anything, or are likely to be, and for what, that 
I may get the information by-and-by, through him, when there is 
any chance. You may depend on my doing all in my power to 
make you comfortable. To God and his infinite grace I commend 
you all.

DEAR SIR, I am here, waiting a conveyance to take me home ; 
have been quite prostrated almost the whole time since you left me 
at John s, with the difficulty in my head and ear, and with the ague 
in consequence. I am now some better. Had a good visit at 
Rochester, but did not effect much. Had a first-rate time at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=peterboro" rel="city">Peterboro</a> ; got of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Mr. Smith</a> and others nearly one hundred and sixty 
dollars, and a note (which I think a good one) for two hundred and 
eighty-five dollars. Mr. S. wrote to Eastern friends to make up at 
least two thousand dollars, saying he was in for one fifth the amount. 
I feel encouraged to believe it will soon be done, and wish you to let 
our folks all round understand how the prospects are. Still, it will 
be some days (and it may be weeks) before I can get ready to return. 
I shall not be idle. If you have found my writing-case and papers,

there is scarce a doubt but that all will be set right in a very few 
days more, so that I can be on my way back. They must none of

DEAR FRIENDS, ALL, Oliver, Martha, and Anne all got on safe 
on Saturday of the week they set out. If W. and D. set out in ten 
days or a week after getting this, they will be quite in time. All 
well. When you write, direct to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">I. Smith</a> & Sons, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chambersburg" rel="city">Chambersburg</a>,

</p><p>
DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, ALL, I write to say that we are 
all well, and that I think <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a> and D. had not best set out until 
we write again, and not until sufficient hay has been secured to winter all the stock well. To be buying hay in the spring or last of the 
winter is ruinous, and there is no prospect of our getting our freight 
on so as to be ready to go to work under some time yet. We will give 
you timely notice. When you write, enclose first in a small enve 
lope, put a stamp on it, seal it, and direct it to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">I. Smith</a> & Sons, 
Harper's Ferry, Va. ; then enclose it under a stamped envelope, 
which direct to John Henrie, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chambersburg" rel="city">Chambersburg</a>, Penn. I need not say, 
do all your directing and sealing at home, and not at the post-office.

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, ALL, If <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a> and D. should 
set out soon after getting this, it may be well. They will avoid saying anything on the road about <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=north elba" rel="city">North Elba</a>,. It will be quite as well 
to say they are from Essex County ; and need not say anything about it unless they are questioned, when they had better say as above. 
Persons who do not talk much are seldom questioned much. They should buy through tickets at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=troy" rel="city">Troy</a> or at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, 
where they will get tickets for Harper's Ferry j and there, by inquiring of Mr. Michael Ault, who keeps the toll-bridge over which they 
have to pass, they can find <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">I. Smith</a> on the Kennedy farm. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a> will be a son and D. his brother-in-law Thompson, if any inquiry is 
made at the bridge or elsewhere. They had better not bring trunks- We are all well. May God abundantly bless and keep you all!

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, ALL, I left all well at home yesterday but Martha, who was complaining a little. Am in hopes 
nothing serious is the matter. I will only now say I am getting along as well, perhaps, all things considered, as I ought to expect. 
We all want to hear from you ; but we do not want you all to write, and you need only say all is well, or otherwise, as the case may be. 
When you write, enclose in a small envelope such as I now send, seal it, and write on it no other directions than <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">I. Smith</a> & Sons.

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, ALL, I write to say that we are 
all well, and are getting along as well as we could reasonably expect. 
It now appears likely that Martha and Anne will be on their way 
home in the course of this month, but they may be detained to a little 
later period. I do not know what to advise about fattening the old 
spotted cow, as much will depend on what you have to feed her with ; 
whether your heifers will come in or not next spring ; also upon her 
present condition. You must exercise the best judgment you have 
in the matter, as I know but little about your crops. I should like 
to know more as soon as I can. I am now in hopes of being able to 
send you something in the way of help before long. May God abundantly bless you all! Ellen, I want you to be very good.

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, ALL, Oliver returned safe on

home, I wish it to be used to make all as comfortable as may be for

DEAR FRIEND, I forgot to say yesterday that your shipments of 
freight are received all in apparent safety ; but the bills are very 
high, and I begin to be apprehensive of getting into a tight spot for 
want of a little more funds, notwithstanding my anxiety to make my 
money hold out. As it will cost no more expense for you to solicit 
for me a little more assistance while attending to your other business, 
say two or three hundred dollars in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, drafts payable to 
the order of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">I. Smith</a> & Sons, will you not sound my Eastern or 
Western friends in regard to it,? It was impossible for me to foresee 
the exact amount I should be obliged to pay out for everything. Now 
that arrangements are so nearly completed, I begin to feel almost certain that I can squeeze through with that amount. All my accounts 
are squared up to the present time ; but how I can keep my little 
wheels in motion for a few days more I am beginning to feel at a 
loss. It is terribly humiliating to me to begin soliciting of friends 
again; but as the harvest opens before me with increasing encouragements, I may not allow a feeling of delicacy to deter me from asking 
the little further aid I expect to need. What I must have to carry 
me through I shall need within a very few days, if I am obliged to 
call direct for further help ; so you will please expect something quite 
definite very soon. I have endeavored to economize in every possible 
way ; and I will not ask for a dollar until I am driven to do so. I 
have a trifle over one hundred and eighty dollars on hand, but am 
afraid I cannot possible make it reach. I am highly gratified with 
all our arrangements up to the present time, and feel certain that no 
time has yet been lost. One freight is principally here, but will have 
to go a little further. Our hands, so far, are coming forward promptly, 
and better than I expected, as we have called on them. We have to 
move with all caution.

</p><p>
FRIEND J. HENRIE, Day before yesterday I reached Rochester. 
Found our Rochester friend absent at Niagara Falls. Yesterday 
he returned, and I spent remainder of day and evening with him and 
Mr. E. Morton, with whom friend Isaac [<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">John Brown</a>] is acquainted. 
The friend at Rochester will set out to make you a visit in a few days. 
He will be accompanied by that " other young man," and also, if it 
can be brought around, by the woman l that the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=syracuse" rel="city">Syracuse</a> friend could 
tell me of. The son will probably remain, back for awhile. I gave 
11 Fred k " l twenty-two dollars to defray expenses. If alive and well, 
you will see him ere long. I found him in rather low spirits ; left 
him in high. Accidentally met at Rochester Mr. E. Morton. He 
was much pleased to hear from you ; was anxious for a copy of that 
letter of instructions to show our friend at " Pr." l [<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=peterboro" rel="city">Peterboro</a> ], who, 
Mr. M. says, has his whole soul absorbed in this matter. I have 
just made him a copy and mailed him at R., where he expects to be 
for two or three weeks. He wished me to say to you that he had 
reliable information that a certain noted colonel, whose name you 
are all acquainted with, is now in Italy. By the way, the impression 
prevails generally that a certain acquaintance of ours headed the 
party that visited St. J. in Missouri lately. Of course I don t try to 
deny that which bears such earmarks. Came on here this morning. 
Found Loguen gone to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, Mass., and also said woman. As 
T. does not know personally those persons in Canada to whom it is 
necessary to have letters of introduction, he thinks I had better get 
him to go with me there. I have made up my mind, notwithstanding the extra expense, to go on to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. Loguen is expecting to 
visit Canada soon, anyway, and his wife thinks would contrive to go 
immediately. I think for other reasons, also, I had better go on to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. Morton says our particular friend Mr. Sanboru, in that 
city, is especially anxious to hear from you j has his heart and hand 
both engaged in the cause. Shall try and find him. Our Rochester 
friend thinks the woman whom I shall see in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, " whose services might prove invaluable," had better be helped on. I leave 
this evening on the 11.35 train from here; shall return as soon as 
possible to make my visit at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chatham" rel="city">Chatham</a>. Will write you often. So 
far, all is well. Keep me advised as far as consistent. 
</p><p>
Fraternally yours,

</p><p>
FRIEND HENRIE, I am here to-day, so far on my way back 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, whither I went on Friday last. Found our <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=syracuse" rel="city">Syracuse</a> 
friend there, but his engagements were such that he could not possibly leave until yesterday morning. We reached here about twelve 
o clock last night. While in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> I improved the time in making 
the acquaintance of those stanch friends of our friend Isaac. First 
called on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=sgh" rel="met friend colleague">Dr. Howe</a>, who, though I had no letter of introduction, 
received me most cordially. He gave me a letter to the friend who 
does business on Milk Street [Mr. Stearns]. Went with him to his 
home in Medford, and took dinner. The last word he said to me 
was, " Tell friend Isaac that we have the fullest confidence in his 
endeavor, whatever may be the result." I have met no man on 
whom I think more implicit reliance may be placed. He views matters from the standpoints of reason and principle, and I think his 
firmness is unshakable. The friend at Concord [<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=fbs" rel="met friend colleague">F. B. Sanborn</a>] I 
did not see ; he was absent from hornet The others here will, how 
ever, communicate with him. They were all, in short, very much 
gratified, and have had their faith and hopes much strengthened. 
Found a number of earnest and warm friends, whose sympathies and 
theories do not exactly harmonize ; but in spite of themselves their 
hearts will lead their heads. Our <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> friends thought it better 
that our old friend from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=syracuse" rel="city">Syracuse</a> [J. W. Loguen] should accompany 
me in my journey northward. I shall leave in an hour or two for 
Rochester, where I will finish this letter. I am very glad I went to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, as all the friends were of the opinion that our friend Isaac 
was in another part of the world, if not in another sphere. Our 
cause is their cause, in the fullest sense of the word.

</p><p>
DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, ALL, I parted with Martha and 
Anne at Harrisburg, yesterday, in company with Oliver, on their 
way home. I trust before this reaches you the women will have arrived safe. I have encouragement of having fifty dollars or more 
sent you soon, to help you to get through the winter; and I shall certainly do all in my power for you, and try to commend you always 
to the God of my fathers. 
</p><p>
Perhaps you can keep your animals in good condition through the 
winter on potatoes mostly, much cheaper than on any other feed. I 
think that would certainly be the case if the crop is good, and is 
secured well and in time. 
</p><p>
I sent along four pairs blankets, with directions for Martha to 
have the first choice, and for Bell, Abbie, and Anne to cast lots for a 
choice in the three other pairs. My reason is that I think Martha 
fairly entitled to particular notice. 1 
</p><p>
To my other daughters I can only send my blessing just now. 
Anne, I want you, first of all, to become a sincere, humble, earnest, 
and consistent Christian ; and then acquire good and efficient business 
habits. Save this letter to remember your father by, Anne. 
</p><p>
You must all send to John hereafter anything you want should get 
to us ; and you may be sure we shall all be very anxious to learn 
everything about your welfare. Read the " Tribune " carefully. It 
may not always be certainly true, however. Begin early to take 
good care of all your animals, and pinch them at the close of the 
winter, if you must at all.

<p>
[BROWN's INTERVIEW WITH MASON, VALLANDIGHAM, AND OTHERS.] 
</p><p>
Senator Mason. Can you tell us who furnished money for your expedition? 
</p><p>
John Brown. I furnished most of it "myself ; I cannot implicate 
others. It is by my own folly that I have been taken. I could 
easily have saved myself from it, had I exercised my own better 
judgment rather than yielded to my feelings. 
</p><p>
Mason. You mean if you had escaped immediately? 
</p><p>
Brown. No. I had the means to make myself secure without 
any escape ; but I allowed myself to be surrounded by a force by 
being too tardy. I should have gone away ; but I had thirty odd 
prisoners, whose wives and daughters were in tears for their safety, 
and I felt for them. Besides, I wanted to allay the fears of those 
who believed we came here to burn and kill. For this reason I 
allowed the train to cross the bridge, and gave them full liberty to 
pass on. I did it only to spare the feelings of those passengers and 
their families, and to allay the apprehensions that you had got here 
in your vicinity a band of men who had no regard for life and property, nor any feelings of humanity. 
</p><p>
Mason. But you killed some people passing along the streets 
quietly. 
</p><p>
Brown. Well, sir, if there was anything of that kind done, it was 
without my knowledge. Your own citizens who were my prisoners 
will tell you that every possible means was taken to prevent it. I 
did not allow my men to fire when there was danger of killing those 
we regarded as innocent persons, if I could help it. They will tell 
you that we allowed ourselves to be fired at repeatedly, and did not 
return it. 
</p><p>
A Bystander. That is not so. You killed an unarmed man at 
the corner of the house over there at the water-tank, and another 
besides. 
</p><p>
Brown. See here, my friend ; it is useless to dispute or contradict the report of your own neighbors who were my prisoners. 
</p><p>
Mason. If you would tell us who sent you here, who provided 
the means, that would be information of some value. 
</p><p>
Brown. I will answer freely and faithfully about what concerns 
myself, I will answer anything I can with honor, but not about 
others. 
</p><p>
Mr. Vallandigham (who had just entered). Mr. Brown, who 
sent you here? 
</p><p>
Brown. No man sent me here ; it was my own prompting and 
that of my Maker, or that of the Devil, whichever you please to 
ascribe it to. I acknowledge no master in human form. 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. Did you get up the expedition yourself? 
</p><p>
Brown. I did. 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. Did you get up this document that is called a 
Constitution? 
</p><p>
Brown. I did. They are a constitution and ordinances of my 
own contriving and getting up. 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. How long have you been engaged in this 
business? 
</p><p>
Brown. From the breaking out of the difficulties in Kansas. 
Four of my sons had gone there to settle, and they induced me to go. 
I did not go there to settle, but because of the difficulties. 
</p><p>
Mason. How many are there engaged with you in this 
movement? 
</p><p>
Brown. Any questions that I can honorably answer I will, not 
otherwise. So far as I am myself concerned, I have told everything 
truthfully. I value my word, sir. 
</p><p>
Mason. What was your object in coming? 
</p><p>
Brown. We came to free the slaves, and only that. 
</p><p>
A Volunteer. How many men, in all, had you? 
</p><p>
Brown. I came to Virginia with eighteen men only, besides 
myself. 
</p><p>
Volunteer. What in the world did you suppose you could do here 
in Virginia with that amount of men? 
</p><p>
Brown. Young man, I do not wish to discuss that question here. 
</p><p>
Volunteer. You could riot do anything. 
</p><p>
Brown. Well, perhaps your ideas and mine on military subjects 
would differ materially. 
</p><p>
Mason. How do you justify your acts? 
</p><p>
Brown I think, my friend, you are guilty of a great wrong 
against God and humanity, I say it without wishing to be offensive, and it would be perfectly right for any one to interfere with 
you so far as to free those you wilfully and wickedly hold in bondage. 
I do not say this insultingly. 
</p><p>
Mason. I understand that. 
</p><p>
Brown. I think I did right, and that others will do right who 
interfere with you at any time and at all times. I hold that the 
Golden Rule, " Do unto others as ye would that others should 
do unto you," applies to all who would help others to gain their 
liberty. 
</p><p>
Lieutenant Stuart. But don t you believe in the Bible? 
</p><p>
Brown. Certainly I do. 
</p><p>
Mason. Did you consider this a military organization in this 
Constitution? I have not yet read it. 
</p><p>
Brown. I did, in some sense. I wish you would give that paper 
close attention. 
</p><p>
Mason. You consider yourself the commander-in-chief of these 
"provisional" military forces? 
</p><p>
Brown. I was chosen, agreeably to the ordinance of a certain 
document, commander-in-chief of that force. 
</p><p>
Mason. What wages did you offer? 
</p><p>
Brown. None. 
</p><p>
Stuart. " The wages of sin is death." 
</p><p>
Brown. I would not have made such a remark to you if you had 
been a prisoner, and wounded, in my hands. 
</p><p>
A Bystander. Did you not promise a negro in Gettysburg twenty 
dollars a month? 
</p><p>
Brown. I did not. 
</p><p>
Mason. Does this talking annoy you? 
</p><p>
Brown. Not in the least. 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. Have you lived long in Ohio? 
</p><p>
Brown. I went there in 1805. I lived in Summit County, which 
was then Portage County. My native place is Connecticut ; my 
father lived there, till 1805. 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. Have you been in Portage County lately? 
</p><p>
Brown. I was there in June last. 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. When in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a>, did you attend the Fugitive 
Slave Law Convention there? 
</p><p>
Brown. No. I was there about the time of the sitting of the 
court to try the Oberlin rescuers. I spoke there publicly on that 
subject ; on the Fugitive Slave Law and my own rescae. Of course, 
so far as I had any influence at all, I was supposed to justify the 
Oberliu people for rescuing the slave, because I have myself forcibly 
taken slaves from bondage. I was concerned in taking eleven slaves 
from Missouri to Canada last winter. I think I spoke in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> 
before the Convention. I do not know that I had conversation with 
any of the Oberlin rescuers. I was sick part of the time I was in 
Ohio with the ague, in Ashtabula County. 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. Did you see anything of Joshua R. Giddings 
there? 
</p><p>
Brown. I did meet him. 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. Did you converse with him? 
</p><p>
Brown. I did. I would not tell you, of course, anything that 
would implicate Mr. Giddiugs ; but I certainly met with him and 
had conversations with him. 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. About that rescue case? 
</p><p>
Brown. Yes ; I heard him express his opinions upon it very 
freely and frankly. 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. Justifying it? 
</p><p>
Brown. Yes, sir j I do not compromise him, certainly, in saying 
that. 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. Will you answer this : Did you talk with Giddings about your expedition here? 
</p><p>
Brown. No, I won t answer that ; because a denial of it I would 
not make, and to make any affirmation of it I should be a great 
dunce. 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. Have you had any correspondence with parties at 
the North on the subject of this movement? 
</p><p>
Brown. I have had correspondence. 
</p><p>
A Bystander. Do you consider this a religious movement? 
</p><p>
Brown. It is, in my opinion, the greatest service man can render 
to God. 
</p><p>
Bystander. Do you consider yourself an instrument in the hands 
of Providence? 
</p><p>
Brown. I do. 
</p><p>
Bystander. Upon what principle do you justify your acts? 
</p><p>
Brown. Upon the Golden Rule. I pity the poor in bondage that 
have none to help them : that is why I am here ; not to gratify any 
personal animosity, revenge, or vindictive spirit. It is my sympathy 
with the oppressed and the wronged, that are as good as you and as 
precious in the sight of God. 
</p><p>
Bystander. Certainly. But why take the slaves against their 
will f 
</p><p>
Brown. I never did. 
</p><p>
Bystander. You did in one instance, at least. 
</p><p>
Stephens, the other wounded prisoner, here said, " You are right. 
In one case I know the negro wanted to go back." 
</p><p>
Bystander. Where did you come from? 
</p><p>
Stephens. I lived in Ashtabula County, Ohio. 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. How recently did you leave Ashtabula County? 
</p><p>
Stephens. Some months ago. I never resided there any length of 
time ; have been through there. 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. How far did you live from Jefferson? 
</p><p>
Brown. Be cautious, Stephens, about any answers that would 
commit any friend. I would not answer that. 
</p><p>
[Stephens turned partially over with a groan of pain, and was 
silent.] 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. Who are your advisers in this movement? 
</p><p>
Brown. I cannot answer that. I have numerous sympathizers 
throughout the entire North. 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. In northern Ohio? 
</p><p>
Brown. No more there than anywhere else ; in all the free 
States. 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. But you are not personally acquainted in southern Ohio? 
</p><p>
Brown. Not very much. 
</p><p>
A Bystander. Did you ever live in Washington City? 
</p><p>
Brown. I did not. I want you to understand, gentlemen, and [to 
the reporter of the " Herald "] you may report that, I want you to 
understand that I respect the rights of the poorest and weakest of 
colored people, oppressed by the slave system, just as much as I do 
those of the most wealthy and powerful. That is the idea that has 
moved me, and that alone. We expected no reward except the satis 
faction of endeavoring to do for those in distress and greatly oppressed 
as we would be done by. The cry of distress of the oppressed is my 
reason, and the only thing that prompted me to come here. 
</p><p>
Bystander. Why did you do it secretly? 
</p><p>
Brown. Because I thought that necessary to success j no other 
reason. 
</p><p>
Bystander. Have you read <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Gerrit Smith's</a> last letter? 
</p><p>
Brown. What letter do you mean? 
</p><p>
Bystander. The " <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> Herald " of yesterday, in speaking 
of this affair, mentions a letter in this way : 
</p><p>
""Apropos of this exciting news, we recollect a very significant passage 
in one of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Gerrit Smith's</a> letters, published a month or two ago, in which he 
speaks of the folly of attempting to strike the shackles off the slaves by the 
force of moral suasion or legal agitation, and predicts that the next movement made in the direction of negro emancipation would be an insurrection 
in the South." 
</p><p>
Brown. I have not seen the " <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> Herald for some days 
past ; but I presume, from your remark about the gist of the letter, 
that I should concur with it. I agree with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=grs" rel="met friend colleague">Mr. Smith</a> that moral 
suasion is hopeless. I don t think the people of the slave States will 
ever consider the subject of slavery in its true light till some other 
argument is resorted to than moral suasion. 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. Did you expect a general rising of the slaves in 
case of your success? 
</p><p>
Brown. No, sir ; nor did I wish it. I expected to gather them 
up from time to time, and set them free. 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. Did you expect to hold possession here till then? 
</p><p>
Brown. Well, probably I had quite a different idea. I do not know 
that I ought to reveal my plans. I am here a prisoner arid wounded, 
because I foolishly allowed myself to be so. You overrate your 
strength in supposing I could have been taken if I had not allowed 
it. I was too tardy after commencing the open attack in delaying 
my movements through Monday night, and up to the time I was 
attacked by the Government troops. It was all occasioned by my 
desire to spare the feelings of my prisoners and their families and 
the community at large. I had no knowledge of the shooting of the 
negro Heywood. 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. What time did you commence your organization 
in Canada f 
</p><p>
Brown. That occurred about two years ago ; in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1858">1858</a>. 
</p><p>
Vallandigham. Who was the secretary? 
</p><p>
Brown. That I would not tell if I recollected; but I do not recollect. I think the officers were elected in May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1858">1858</a>. I may answer 
incorrectly, but not intentionally. My head is a little confused by 
wounds, and my memory obscure on dates, etc. 
</p><p>
Dr. Biggs. Were you in the party at Dr. Kennedy's house? 
</p><p>
Brown. I was the head of that party. I occupied the house 
to mature my plans. I have not been in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> to purchase 
caps. 
</p><p>
Dr. Biggs. What was the number of men at Kennedy's? 
</p><p>
Brown. I decline to answer that. 
</p><p>
Dr. Biggs. Who lanced that woman's neck on the hill? 
</p><p>
Brown. I did. I have sometimes practised in surgery when I 
thought it a matter of humanity and necessity, and there was no one 
else to do it ; but I have not studied surgery. 
</p><p>
Dr. Biggs. It was done very well and scientifically. They have 
been very clever to the neighbors, I have been told, and we had no 
reason to suspect them, except that we could not understand their 
movements. They were represented as eight or nine persons ; on 
Friday there were thirteen. 
</p><p>
Brown. There were more than that. 
</p><p>
Q. Where did you get arms? A. I bought them. 
</p><p>
Q. In what State I A. That I will not state. 
</p><p>
Q. How many guns? A. Two hundred Sharpe's rifles and two 
hundred revolvers, what is called the Massachusetts Arms Company's revolvers, a little under navy size. 
</p><p>
Q. Why did you not take that swivel you left in the house? 
A. I had no occasion for it. It was given to me a year or two 
ago. 
</p><p>
Q. In Kansas? A. No. I had nothing given to me in Kansas. 
</p><p>
Q. By whom, and in what State? A. 1 decline to answer. It 
is not properly a swivel; it is a very large rifle with a pivot. The 
ball is larger than a musket ball; it is intended for a slug. 
</p><p>
Reporter. I do not wish to annoy you ; but if you have anything 
further you would like to say, I will report it. 
</p><p>
Brown. I have nothing to say, only that I claim to be here in 
carrying out a measure I believe perfectly justifiable, and not to act 
the part of an incendiary or ruffian, but to aid those suffering great 
wrong. I wish to say, furthermore, that you had better all you 
people at the South prepare yourselves for a settlement of this 
question, that must come up for settlement sooner than you are pre 
pared for it. The sooner you are prepared the better. You may 
dispose of me very easily, I am nearly disposed of now ; but this 
question is still to be settled, this negro question I mean ; the end 
of that is not yet. These wounds were inflicted upon me both sabre cuts on my head and bayonet stabs in different parts of my 
body some minutes after I had ceased fighting and had consented to 
surrender, for the benefit of others, not for my own. 1 I believe the 
Major would not have been alive ; I could have killed him just as 
easy as a mosquito when he came in, but I supposed he only came 
in to receive our surrender. There had been loud and long calls 
of " surrender" from us, as loud as men could yell; but in the 
confusion and excitement I suppose we were not heard. I do not 
think the Major, or any one, meant to butcher us after we had 
surrendered. 
</p><p>
An Officer. Why did you not surrender before the attack? 
</p><p>
Brown. I did not think it was my duty or interest to do so. We 
assured the prisoners that we did not wish to harm them, and they 
should be set at liberty. I exercised my best judgment, not believ 
ing the people would wantonly sacrifice their own fellow- citizens, 
when we offered to let them go on condition of being allowed to 
change our position about a quarter of a mile. The prisoners agreed 
by a vote among themselves to pass across the bridge with us. We 
</p><p>
1 At the trial of Copeland the following evidence was given : 
</p><p>
Mr. Sennott. You say that when Brown was down you struck him in the face with 
your sabre? 
</p><p>
Lieutenant Green. Yes. 
</p><p>
Q. This was after he was down? A. Yes ; he was down. 
</p><p>
Q. How many times, Lieutenant Green, did you strike Brown in the face with your 
sabre after he was down? A. Why, sir, he was defending himself with his gun. 
</p><p>
Mr. Hunter. I hope the counsel for the defence will not press such questions as theye. 
wanted them only as a sort of guarantee of our own safety, that we 
should not be fired into. We took them, in the first place, as host 
ages and to keep them from doing any harm. We did kill some 
men in defending ourselves, but I saw no one fire except directly in 
self-defence. Our orders were strict not to harm any one not in arms 
against us. 
</p><p>
Q. Brown, suppose you had every nigger in the United States, 
what would you do with them? A. Set them free. 
</p><p>
Q. Your intention was to carry them off and free them? A. Not 
at all. 
</p><p>
A Bystander. To set them free would sacrifice the life of every 
man in this community. 
</p><p>
Brown. I do not think so. 
</p><p>
Bystander. I know it. I think you are fanatical. 
</p><p>
Brown. And I think you are fanatical. " Whom the gods would 
destroy they first make mad," and you are mad. 
</p><p>
Q. Was it your only object to free the negroes? A. Absolutely 
our only object. 
</p><p>
Q. But you demanded and took Colonel Washington's silver and 
watch? A. Yes ; we intended freely to appropriate the property of 
slaveholders to carry out our object. It was for that, and only that, 
and with no design to enrich ourselves with any plunder whatever. 
</p><p>
Bystander. Did you know Sherrod in Kansas? I understand you 
killed him. 
</p><p>
Brown. I killed no man except in fair fight. I fought at Black 
Jack Point and at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a> ; and if I killed anybody, it was at 
one of these places.

DEAR SIR, I am here a prisoner, with several sabre-cuts in my 
head and bayonet-stabs in my body. My object in writing, to you is 
to obtain able and faithful counsel for myself and fellow-prisoners 
(five in all), as we have the faith of Virginia pledged through her 
Governor and numerous other prominent citizens to give us a fair 
trial. Without we can obtain such counsel from without the slave 
States, neither the facts in our case can come before the world, nor 
can we have the benefit of such facts as might be considered miti 
gating in the view of others upon our trial. I have money in hand 
here to the amount of two hundred and fifty dollars, and personal 
property sufficient to pay a, most liberal fee to yourself, or to any 
suitable man who will undertake our defence, if I can be allowed the 
benefit of said property. Can you or some other good man come on 
immediately, for the sake of the young men prisoners at least? My 
wounds are doing well. Do not send an ultra Abolitionist. 
Very respectfully yours,

</p><p>
MY DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, I suppose you 
have learned before this by the newspapers that two weeks ago to 
day we were fighting for our lives at Harper's Ferry ; that during 
the fight <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a> was mortally wounded, Oliver killed, William Thompson killed, and Dauphin slightly wounded ; that on the fol 
lowing day I was taken prisoner, immediately after which I received 
several sabre-cuts on my head and bayonet-stabs in my body. As 
nearly as I can learn, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a> died of his wound on Wednesday, the 
second or on Thursday, the third day after I was taken. Dauphin 
was killed when I was taken, and Anderson I suppose also. I have 
since been tried, and found guilty of treason, etc., and of murder in 
the first degree. I have not yet received my sentence. No others of 
the company with whom you were acquainted were, so far as I can 
learn, either killed or taken. Under all these terrible calamities, I 
feel quite cheerful in the assurance that God reigns and will overrule 
all for his glory and the best possible good. I feel no consciousness 
of guilt in the matter, nor even mortification on account of my imprisonment and irons ; and I feel perfectly sure that very soon no 
member of my family will feel any possible disposition to " blush on 
my account." Already dear friends at a distance, with kindest sympathy, are cheering me with the assurance that posterity, at least, 
will do me justice. I shall commend you all together, with my be 
loved but bereaved daughters-in-law, to their sympathies, which I 
do not doubt will soon reach you. I also commend you all to Him 
"whose mercy endureth forever," to the God of my fathers, "whose 
I am, and whom I serve." " He will never leave you nor forsake 
you," unless you forsake Him. Finally, my dearly beloved, be of 
good comfort. Be sure to remember and follow my advice, and my 
example too, so far as it has been consistent with the holy religion 
of Jesus Christ, in which I remain a most firm and humble believer. Never forget the poor, nor think anything you bestow on 
them to be lost to you, even though they may be black as Ebedmelech, the Ethiopian eunuch, who cared for Jeremiah in the pit of the 
dungeon ; or as black as the one to whom Philip preached Christ. 
Be sure to entertain strangers, for thereby some have " Remember them that are in bonds as bound with them." 
</p><p>
I am in charge of a jailer like the one who took charge of Paul 
and Silas ; and you may rest assured that both kind hearts and kind 
faces are more or less about me, while thousands are thirsting for 
my blood. " These light afflictions, which are but for a moment, 
shall work out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of 
glory." I hope to be able to write you again. Copy this, Ruth, 
and send it to your sorrow-stricken brothers to comfort them. Write 
me a few words in regard to the welfare of all. God Almighty bless 
you all, and make you "joyful in the midst of all your tribulations! "

MRS. L. MARIA CHILD. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR FRIEND, such you prove to be, though a stranger, 
Your most kind letter has reached me, with the kind offer to come 
here and take care of me. Allow me to express my gratitude for 
your great sympathy, and at the same time to propose to you a different course, together with my reasons for wishing it. I should 
certainly be greatly pleased to become personally acquainted with 
one so gifted and so kind ; but I cannot avoid seeing some objections 
to it under present circumstances. First, I am in charge of a most 
humane gentleman, who with his family have rendered me every 
possible attention I have desired or that could be of the least advantage ; and I am so far recovered from my wounds as no longer to re 
quire nursing. Then, again, it would subject you to great personal 
inconvenience and heavy expense, without doing me any good. Al 
low me to name to you another channel through which you may 
reach me with your sympathies much more effectually. I have at 
home a wife and three young daughters, the youngest but little over 
five years old, the oldest nearly sixteen. I have also two daughters- 
in-law, whose husbands have both fallen near me here. There is 
also another widow, Mrs. Thompson, whose husband fell here. 
Whether she is a mother or not I cannot say. All these, my wife 
included, live at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=north elba" rel="city">North Elba</a>,, Essex County, N. Y. I have a middle- 
aged son, who has been in some degree a cripple from his childhood, 
who would have as much as he could well do to earn a living. He 
was a most dreadful sufferer in Kansas, and lost all he had laid up. 
He has not enough to clothe himself for the winter comfortably. 
I have no living son or son-in-law who did not suffer terribly in 
Kansas. 
</p><p>
Now, dear friend, would you not as soon contribute fifty cents now, 
and a like sum yearly, for the relief of those very poor and deeply 
afflicted persons, to enable them to supply themselves and their children with bread and very plain clothing, and to enable the children 
to receive a common English education? Will you also devote your 
own energies to induce others to join you in giving a like amount, 
to constitute a little fund for the purpose named? 
</p><p>
I cannot see how your coming here can do me the least good ; and 
I am quite certain you can do me immense good where you are. I 
am quite cheerful under all my afflicting circumstances and prospects; 
having, as I humbly trust, " the peace of God, which passeth all 
understanding," to rule in my heart. You may make such use of 
this as you see fit. God Almighty bless and reward you a thousand 
fold! Yours in sincerity and truth,

</p><p>
MY DEAR FRIEND E. B. OF R. I., Your most cheering letter of 
the 27th of October is received ; and may the Lord reward you a 
thousandfold for the kind feeling you express toward me ; but more 
especially for your fidelity to the " poor that cry, and those that have 
no help." For this I am a prisoner in bonds. It is solely my own 
fault, in a military point of view, that we met with our disaster. I 
mean that I mingled with our prisoners and so far sympathized with 
them and their families that I neglected my duty in other respects. 
But God's will, not mine, be done. 
</p><p>
You know that Christ once armed Peter. So also in my case I 
think he put a sword into my hand, and there continued it so long as 
he saw best, and then kindly took it from me. I mean when I first 
went to Kansas. I wish you could know with what cheerfulness I 
am now wielding the " sword of the Spirit" on the right hand and 
on the left. I bless God that it proves " mighty to the pulling down 
of strongholds." I always loved my Quaker friends, and I commend to their kind regard my poor bereaved widowed wife and my daughters and daughters-in-law, whose husbands fell at my side. One is 
a mother and the other likely to become so soon. They, as well as 
my own sorrow- stricken daughters, are left very poor, and have much 
greater need of sympathy than I, who, through Infinite Grace and 
the kindness of strangers, am "joyful in all my tribulations." 
</p><p>
Dear sister, write them at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=north elba" rel="city">North Elba</a>,. Essex County, N. Y., to 
comfort their sad hearts. Direct to Mary A., Brown, wife of John 
Brown. There is also another a widow, wife of Thompson, who 
fell with my poor boys in the affair at Harper's Ferry at the same 
place. 
</p><p>
I do not feel conscious of guilt in taking up arms j and had it been 
in behalf of the rich and powerful, the intelligent, the great (as men 
count greatness), or those who form enactments to suit, themselves 
and corrupt others, or some of their friends, that I interfered, suffered, 
sacrificed, and fell, it would have been doing very well. But enough 
of this. These light afflictions, which endure for a moment, shall but 
work for me " a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory." I 
would be very grateful for another letter from you. My wounds are 
healing. Farewell. God will surely attend to his own cause in the 
best possible way and time, and he will not forget the work of his 
own hands. Your friend,

DEAR SIR, I have just had my attention called to a seeming confliction between 
the statement I at first made to Governor Wise and that which I made at the time 1 
received my sentence, regarding my intentions respecting the slaves we took about the 
Ferry. There need be no such confliction, and a few words of explanation will, I 
think, be quite sufficient. I had given Governor Wise a full and particular account of 
that ; and when called in court to say whether I had anything further to urge, I was 
taken wholly by surprise, as I did not expect my sentence before the others. In the 
hurry of the moment I forgot much that I had before intended to say, and did not con 
sider the full bearing of what I then said. I intended to convey this idea, that it was 
my object to place the slaves in a condition to defend their liberties, if they would, with 
out any bloodshed ; but not that I intended to run them out of the slave States. I was 
not aware of any such apparent confliction until my attention was called to it, and I do 
not suppose that a man in my then circumstances should be superhuman in respect to 
the exact purport of every word he might litter. What I said to Governor Wise was spo 
ken with all the deliberation I was master of, and was intended for truth ; and what I 
said in court was equally intended for truth, but required a more full explanation than 
I then gave. Please make such use of this as you think calculated to correct any wrong 
impressions I may have given. Very respectfully yours,

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, I will begin by saying that I have in some degree recovered from my wounds, but that 
I am quite weak in my back and sore about my left kidney. My 
appetite has been quite good for most of the time since I was hurt. 
I am supplied with almost everything I could desire to make me 
comfortable, and the little I do lack (some articles of clothing which 
I lost) I may perhaps soon get again. I am, besides, quite cheerful, 
having (as I trust) " the peace of God, which passeth all under 
standing," to " rule in my heart," and the testimony (in some degree) 
of a good conscience that I have not lived altogether in vain. I can 
trust God with both the time and the manner of my death, believing, 
as I now do, that for me at this time to seal my testimony for God 
and humanity with my blood will do vastly more toward advancing 
the cause I have earnestly endeavored to promote, than all I have 
done in my life before. I beg of you all meekly and quietly to submit to this, not feeling yourselves in the least degraded on that 
account. Remember, dear wife and children all, that Jesus of Nazareth suffered a most excruciating death on the cross as a felon, under 
the most aggravating circumstances. Think also of the prophets and 
apostles and Christians of former days, who went through greater 
tribulations than you or I, and try to be reconciled. May God 
Almighty comfort all your hearts, and soon wipe away all tears from 
your eyes! To him be endless praise! Think, too, of the crushed 
millions who " have no comforter." I charge you all never in your 
trials to forget the griefs " of the poor that cry, and of those that 
have none to help them." I wrote most earnestly to my dear and 
afflicted wife not to come on for the present, at any rate. I will now 
give her my reasons for doing so. First, it would use up all the 
scanty means she has, or is at all likely to have, to make herself and 
children comfortable hereafter. For let me tell you that the sympathy that is now aroused in your behalf may not always follow you. 
There is but little more of the romantic about helping poor widows 
and their children than there is about trying to relieve poor " niggers." Again, the little comfort it might afford us to meet again 
would be dearly bought by the pains of a final separation. We must 
part ; and I feel assured for us to meet under such dreadful circumstances would only add to our distress. If she comes on here, she 
must be only a gazing-stock throughout the whole journey, to be re 
marked upon in every look, word, and action, and by all sorts of 
creatures, and by all sorts of papers, throughout the whole country. 
Again, it is my most decided judgment that in quietly and submissively staying at home vastly more of generous sympathy will reach 
her, without such dreadful sacrifice of feeling as she must put up 
with if she comes on. The visits of one or two female friends that 
have come on here have produced great excitement, which is very 
annoying; and they cannot possibly do me any good. Oh, Mary! 
do not come, but patiently wait for the meeting of those who love God and their fellow-men, where no separation must follow. u They 
shall go no more out forever." I greatly long to hear from some 
one of you, and to learn anything that in any way affects your welfare. I sent you ten dollars the other day ; did you get it? I 
have also endeavored to stir up Christian friends to visit and write to 
you in your deep affliction. I have no doubt that some of them, at 
least, will heed the call. Write to me, care of Captain John Avis, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charlestown" rel="city">Charlestown</a>, Jefferson County, Virginia. 
</p><p>
" Finally, my beloved, be of good comfort." May all your names 
be " written in the Lamb's book of life! " may you all have the 
purifying and sustaining influence of the Christian religion! is the 
earnest prayer of 
</p><p>
Your affectionate husband and father,

P. S. I cannot remember a night so dark as to have hindered the 
coming day, nor a storm so furious or dreadful as to prevent the re 
turn of warm sunshine and a cloudless sky. But, beloved ones, do 
remember that this is not your rest, that in this world you have 
no abiding place or continuing city. To God and his infinite mercy 
I always commend you.

DEAR BROTHER JEREMIAH, Your kind letter of the 9th inst. is 
received, and also one from Mr. Tilden ; for both of which I am 
greatly obliged. You inquire, " Can I do anything for you or your 
family?" I would answer that my sons, as well as my wife and 
daughters, are all very poor ; and that anything that may hereafter be 
due me from my father's estate I wish paid to them, as I will endeavor hereafter to describe, without legal formalities to consume it 
all. One of my boys has been so entirely used up as very likely to 
be in want of comfortable clothing for the winter. I have, through 
the kindness of friends, fifteen dollars to send him, which I will remit shortly. If you know where to reach him, please send him that 
amount at once, as I shall remit the same to you by a safe conveyance. If I had a plain statement from Mr. Thompson of the state of 
my accounts with the estate of my father, I should then better know 
what to say about that matter. As it is, I have not the least memorandum left me to refer to. If Mr. Thompson will make me a 
statement, and charge my dividend fully for his trouble, I would be 
greatly obliged to him. In that case you can send me any remarks 
of your own. I am gaining in health slowly, and am quite cheerful 
in view of my approaching end, being fully persuaded that I am 
worth inconceivably more to hang than for any other purpose. God 
Almighty bless and save you all! 
</p><p>
Your affectionate brother, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">JOHN BROWN</a>.

November 13. 
</p><p>
P. S. Say to my poor boys never to grieve for one moment on 
my account ; and should many of you live to see the time when you 
will not blush to own your relation to Old John Brown, it will not 
be more strange than many things that have happened. I feel a 
thousand times more on account of my sorrowing friends than on rny 
own account. So far as I am concerned, I " count it all joy." " I 
have fought the good fight," and have, as I trust, " finished my 
course." Please show this to any of my family that you may see. 
My love to all ; and may God, in his infinite mercy, for Christ's 
sake, bless and save you all!

MY DEAR SIR, Your kind mention of some things in my conduct here which you approve .is .very comforting,, indeed, ..to. my 
mind. Yet I am conscious that you do me no more than justice. I 
do certainly feel that through Divine grace I have endeavored to be 
" faithful in a few things," mingling with even these much of im 
perfection. I am certainly " unworthy even to suffer affliction with 
the people of God ; " yet in infinite grace he has thus honored 
me. May the same grace enable me to serve him in a " new obedience" through my little remainder of this life, and to rejoice in him 
forever. I cannot feel that God will suffer even the poorest service 
we may any of us render him or his cause to be lost or in vain. I 
do feel, dear brother, that I am wonderfully u strengthened from on 
high." May I use that strength in " showing His strength unto this 
generation," and His power to every one that is to come! I am most 
grateful for your assurance that my poor, shattered, heart-broken 
family will not be forgotten. I have long tried to recommend them 
to " the God of my fathers." I have many opportunities for faithful 
plain-dealing with the more powerful, influential, and intelligent 
classes in this region, which I trust are not entirely misimproved. I 
humbly trust that I firmly believe that " God reigns," and I think I 
can truly say, " Let the earth rejoice! " May God take care of his 
own cause, and of his own great name, as well as of those who love 
their neighbors. Farewell! Yours in truth,

REV. H. L. VAILL. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR, STEADFAST FRIEND, Your most kind and most 
welcome letter of the 8th inst. reached me in due time. I am very 
grateful for all the good feeling you express, and also for the kind 
counsels you give, together with your prayers in my behalf. Allow 
me here to say, notwithstanding " my soul is among lions," still I 
believe that u God in very deed is with me." You will not, there 
fore, feel surprised Avhen I tell you that I am " joyful in all my tribulations } " that I do not feel condemned of Him whose j-udgment is 
just, nor of my own conscience. Nor do I feel degraded by rny imprisonment, my chains, or prospect of the gallows. I have not 
only been (though utterly unworthy) permitted to " suffer affliction 
with God's people," but have also had a great many rare opportunities for u preaching righteousness in the great congregation." I 
trust it will not all be lost. The jailer (in whose charge I am) and 
his family and assistants have all been most kind ; and notwith 
standing he was one of the bravest of all who fought me, he is now 
being abused for his humanity. So far as my observation goes, none 
but brave men are likely to be humane to a Mien foe. " Cowards 
prove their courage by their ferocity." It may be done in that way 
with but little risk. 
</p><p>
I wish I could write you about a few only of the interesting times 
I here experience with different classes of men, clergymen among 
others. Christ, the great captain of liberty as well as of salvation, 
and who began his mission, as foretold of him, by proclaiming it, 
saw fit to take from me a sword of steel after I had carried it for a 
time; but he has put another in my hand ("the sword of the 
Spirit"), and I pray God to make me a faithful soldier, wherever he 
may send me, not less on the scaffold than when surrounded by my 
warmest sympathizers. 
</p><p>
My dear old friend, I do assure you I have not forgotten our last 
meeting, nor our retrospective look over the route by which God had 
then led us ; and I bless his name that he has again enabled me to 
hear your words of cheering and comfort at a time when I, at least, 
am on the " brink of Jordan." (See Bunyan's "Pilgrim.") God in 
infinite mercy grant us soon another meeting on the opposite shore. 
I have often passed under the rod of him whom I call my Father, 
and certainly no son ever needed it oftener ; and yet I have enjoyed 
much of life, as I was enabled to discover the secret of this somewhat 
early. It has been in making the prosperity and happiness of others 
my own ; so that really I have had a great deal of prosperity. I am 
very prosperous still; and looking forward to a time when " peace 
on earth and good-will to men " shall everywhere prevail, I have no 
murmuring thoughts or envious feelings to fret my mind. "I ll 
praise my Maker with my breath." 
</p><p>
I am an unworthy nephew of Deacon John, and I loved him much ; 
and in view of the many choice friends I have had here, I am led the 
more earnestly to pray, " gather not my soul with the unrighteous." 
</p><p>
Your assurance of the earnest sympathy of the friends in my native 
land is very grateful to my feelings ; and allow me to say a word of 
comfort to them. 
</p><p>
As I believe most firmly that God reigns, I cannot believe that 
anything I have done, suffered, or may yet suffer will be lost to the 
cause of God or of humanity. And before I began my work at Harper's Ferry, I felt assured that in the worst event it would certainly 
pay. I often expressed that belief ; and I can now see no possible 
cause to alter my mind. I am not as yet, in the main, at all disappointed. I have been a good deal disappointed as it regards myself 
in not keeping up to my own plans; but I now feel entirely reconciled to that, even, for God's plan was infinitely better, no doubt, or 
I should have kept to my own. Had Samson kept to his determination of not telling Delilah wherein his great strength lay, he would 
probably have never overturned the house. I did not tell Delilah, 
but I was induced to act very contrary to my better judgment ; and I 
have lost my two noble boys, and other friends, if not my two eyes. 
</p><p>
But " God's will, not mine, be done." I feel a comfortable hope 
that, like that erring servant of whom I have just been writing, even 
I may (through infinite mercy in Christ Jesus) yet " die in faith." 
As to both the time and manner of my death, I have but very little 
trouble on that score, and am able to be (as you exhort) " of good 
cheer." 
</p><p>
I send, through you, my best wishes to Mrs. W. l and her 
</p><p>
son George, and to all dear friends. May the God of the poor and 
oppressed be the God and Savior of you all! 
</p><p>
Farewell, till we meet again. 
</p><p>
Your friend in truth,

MY DEAR WIFE, I write you in answer to a most kind letter of 
November 13 from dear Mrs. Spring. I owe her ten thousand thanks 
for her kindness to you particularly, and more especially than for 
what she has done and is doing in a more direct way for me personally. Although I feel grateful for every expression of kindness 
or sympathy towards me, yet nothing can so effectually minister to 
my comfort as acts of kindness done to relieve the wants or mitigate the sufferings of my poor distressed family. May God Almighty 
and their own consciences be their eternal rewarders! I am exceedingly rejoiced to have you make the acquaintance and be 
surrounded by such choice friends, as I have long known by 
reputation some of those to be with whom you are staying. I 
am most glad to have you meet with one of a family (or I would 
rather say of two families) most beloved and never to be forgotten 
by me. I mean dear gentle . Many and many a time have she, her father, mother, brother, sisters, uncle, and aunt, like angels 
of mercy, ministered to the wants of myself and of my poor sons, 
both in sickness and health. Only last year I lay sick for quite a 
number of weeks with them, and was cared for by all as though I 
had been a most affectionate brother or father. Tell her that I 
ask God to bless and reward them all forever. "I was a stranger, 
and they took me in." It may possibly be that would like to 
copy this letter, and send it to her home. If so, by all means let 
her do so. I would write them if I had the power. 
</p><p>
Now let me say a word about the effort to educate our daughters. 
I am no longer able to provide means to help towards that object, 
and it therefore becomes me not to dictate in the matter. I shall 
gratefully submit the direction of the whole thing to those whose generosity may lead them to undertake in their behalf, while I give anew 
a little expression of my own choice respecting it. You, my wife, perfectly well know that I have always expressed a decided preference 
for a very plain but perfectly practical education for both sons and 
daughters. I do not mean an education so very miserable as that 
you and I received in early life ; nor as some of our children enjoyed. 
When I say plain but practical, I mean enough of the learning of the 
schools to enable them to transact the common business of life comfortably and respectably, together with that thorough training to 
good business habits which best prepares both men and women to 
be useful though poor, and to meet the stern realities of life with 
a good grace. You well know that I always claimed that the 
music of the broom, wash-tub, needle, spindle, loom, axe, scythe, 
hoe, flail, etc., should first be learned at all events, and that of the 
piano, etc., afterwards. I put them in that order as most conducive to health of body and mind ; and for the obvious reason, that 
after a life of some experience and of much observation, I have 
found ten women as well as ten men who have made their mark 
in life right, whose early training was of that plain, practical kind, 
to one who had a more popular and fashionable early training. But 
enough of that. 
</p><p>
Now, in regard to your coming here. If you feel sure that you can 
endure the trials and the shock which will be unavoidable (if you 
come), I should be most glad to see you once more ; but when I 
think of your being insulted on the road, and perhaps while here, 
and of only seeing your wretchedness made complete, I shrink from 
it. Your composure and fortitude of mind may be quite equal to it 
all ; but I am in dreadful doubt of it. If you do come, defer your 
journey till about the 27th or 28th of this month. The scenes which 
you will have to pass through on coming here will be anything but 
those you now pass, with tender, kind-hearted friends, and kind faces 
to meet you everywhere. Do consider the matter well before you 
make the plunge. I think I had better say no more on thia most painful subject. My health improves a little; my mind is very tranquil, I 
may say joyous, and I continue to receive every kind attention that I 
have any possible need of. I wish you to send copies of all my letters to all our poor children. What I write to one must answer for 
all, till I have more strength. I get numerous kind letters from 
friends in almost all directions, to encourage me to u be of good 
cheer," and I still have, as I trust, " the peace of God to rule in my 
heart." May God, for Christ's sake, ever make his face to shine on 
you all!

Thomas B. MUSGRAVE, ESQ. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND, I have just received your most kind 
and welcome letter of the 15th inst., but did not get any other from you. 
I am under many obligations to you and to your father for all the 
kindnesses you have shown me, especially since my disaster. May 
God and your own consciousness ever be your rewarders. Tell your 
father that 1 am quite cheerful ; that I do not feel myself in the least 
degraded by my imprisonment, my chains, or the near prospect of 
the gallows. Men cannot imprison, or chain, or hang the soul. I 
go joyfully in behalf of millions that " have no rights " that this 
great and glorious, this Christian Republic " is bound to respect." 
Strange change in morals, political as well as Christian, since 
1776! I look forward to other changes to take place in God's 
good time, fully believing that " the fashion of this world passeth 
away." I am unable now to tell you where my friend is, that you 
inquire after. Perhaps my wife, who I suppose is still with Mrs. 
Spring, may have some information of him. I think it quite uncertain, however. 
</p><p>
Farewell. May God abundantly bless you all!

REV. LUTHER HUMPHREY. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR FRIEND, Your kind letter of the 12th instant is now 
before me. So far as my knowledge goes as to our mutual kindred, 
</p><p>
I suppose T am the first since the landing of Peter Brown from the II Mayflower" that has either been sentenced to imprisonment or to the 
gallows. But, my dear old friend, let not that fact alone grieve you. 
You cannot have forgotten how and where our grandfather fell in 
1776, and that he, too, might have perished on the scaffold had circumstances been but a very little different. The fact that a man 
dies under the hand of an executioner (or otherwise) has but little to 
do with his true character, as I suppose. John Rogers perished at 
the stake, a great and good man, as I suppose; but his doing so does 
not prove that any other man who has died in the same way was 
good or otherwise. 
</p><p>
Whether I have any reason to " be of good cheer" or not in view 
of my end, I can assure you that I feel so; and I am totally blinded 
if I do not really experience that strengthening and consolation you 
so faithfully implore in my behalf : the God of our fathers reward 
your fidelity! I neither feel mortified, degraded, nor in the least 
ashamed of my imprisonment, my chains, or near prospect of death 
by hanging. I feel assured "that not one hair shall fall from my 
head without the will of my Heavenly Father." I also feel that I 
have long been endeavoring to hold exactly u such a fast as God has 
chosen." (See the passage in Isaiah which you have quoted. 1 ) No 
part of my life has been more happily spent than that I have spent 
here ; and I humbly trust that no part has been spent to better purpose. I would not say this boastingly, but thanks be unto God, who 
giveth us the victory through infinite grace. 
</p><p>
I should be sixty years old were I to live to May 9&gt; 1860. I have 
enjoyed much of life as it is, and have been remarkably prosperous, 
having early learned to regard the welfare and prosperity of others as 
my own. I have never, since I can remember, required a great 
amount of sleep ; so that I conclude that I have already enjoyed full 
an average number of working hours with those who reach their 
threescore years and ten. I have not yet been driven to the use of 
glasses, but can see to read and write quite comfortably. But more 
than that. I have generally enjoyed remarkably good health. I might 
go on to recount unnumbered and unmerited blessings, among which 
would be some very severe afflictions, and those the most needed 
blessings of all. And now, when I think how easily I might be left 
to spoil all I have done or suffered in the cause of freedom, I hardly 
dare wish another voyage, even if I had the opportunity. 
</p><p>
It is a long time since we met ; but we shall come together in our 
Father's house, I trust. Let us hold fast that we already have, remembering we shall reap in due time if we faint not. Thanks be 
unto God, who giveth us the victory through Jesus Christ our Lord. 
And now, my old, warm-hearted friend, good-by. 
Your affectionate cousin,

</p><p>
MY DEAR WIFE, Your most welcome letter of the 13th instant 
I g t yesterday. I am very glad to learn from yourself that you feel 
so much resigned to your circumstances, so much confidence in a wise 
and good Providence, and such composure of mind in the midst of 
all your deep afflictions. This is just as it should be; and let me 
still say, " Be of good cheer," for we shall soon " come out of all our 
great tribulations ; " and very soon, if we trust in him, " God shall 
wipe away all tears from our eyes." Soon " we shall be satisfied 
when we are awake in His likeness." There is now here a source of 
much disquietude to me, namely, the fires which are almost of 
daily and nightly occurrence in this immediate neighborhood. While 
I well know that no one of them is the work of our friends, I know 
at the same time that by more or less of the inhabitants we shall be 
charged with them, the same as with the ominous and threatening 
letters to Governor Wise. In the existing state of public feeling I 
can easily see a further objection to your coming here at present ; but 
I did not intend saying another word to you on that subject. 
</p><p>
Why will you not say to me whether you had any crops mature 
this season? If so, what ones? Although I may nevermore inter- 
meddle with your worldly affairs, I have not yet lost all interest m 
them. A little history of your success or of your failures I should 
very much prize ; and I would gratify you and other friends some 
way were it in my power. I am still quite cheerful, and by no means 
cast down. I " remember that the time is short." The little trunk 
and all its contents, so far as I can judge, reached me safe. May 
God reward all the contributors! I wrote you under cover to our 
excellent friend Mrs. Spring on the 16th instant. I presume you 
have it before now. When you return, it is most likely the lake will 
not be open ; so you must get your ticket at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=troy" rel="city">Troy</a> for Moreau Station 
or Glens Falls (for Glens Falls, if you can get one), or get one for 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vergennes" rel="city">Vergennes</a> in Vermont, and take your chance of crossing over on the 
ice to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=westport" rel="city">Westport</a>. If you go soon, the route by Glens Falls to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=elizabethtown" rel="city">Elizabethtown</a>. will probably be the best. 
</p><p>
I have just learned that our poor <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a> lingered until Wednesday 
about noon of the 19th of October. Oliver died near my side in a 
few moments after he was shot. Dauphin died the next morning 
after Oliver and William were killed, namely, Monday. He died 
almost instantly ; was by my side. William was shot by several 
persons. Anderson was killed with Dauphin.

DEAR CHILDREN, ALL, I address this letter to you, supposing 
that your mother is not yet with you. She has not yet come here, 
as I have requested her not to do at present, if at all. She may think 
it best for her not to come at all. She has (or will), I presume, writ 
ten you before this. Annie's letter to us both, of the 9th, has but just 
reached me. I am very glad to get it, and to learn that you are in 
any measure cheerful. This is the greatest comfort I can have, except that it would be to know that you are all Christians. God in 
mercy grant you all may be so! That is what you all will certainly 
need. When and in what form death may come is but of small moment. I feel just as content to die for God's eternal truth and for 
suffering humanity on the scaffold as in any other way ; and I do 
not say this from any disposition to " brave it out." No ; I would 
readily own my wrong were I in the least convinced of it. I have 
now been confined over a month, with a good opportunity to look the 
whole thing as "fair in the face" as I am capable of doing; and I 
now feel it most grateful that I am counted in the least possible degree worthy to sutler for the truth. I want you all to "be uf good 
cheer." This life is intended as a season of training, chastisement, 
temptation, affliction, and trial; and the " righteous shall come out 
of" it all. Oh, my dear children, let me again entreat you all to 
"forsake the foolish, and live." What can you possibly lose by such 
a course? "Godliness with contentment is great gain, having the 
promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come." " Trust 
in the Lord and do good, so shalt thou dwell in the land ; and verily 
thou shalt be fed." I have enjoyed life much ; why should I com 
plain on leaving it? I want some of you to write me a little more 
particularly about all that concerns your welfare. I intend to write 
you as often as I can. ".To God and the word of his grace I com 
mend you all." Your affectionate father,

DEAR CHILDREN, Your most welcome letters of the 16th inst. 
I have just received, and I bless God that he has enabled you to bear 
the heavy tidings of our disaster with so much seeming resignation 
and composure of mind. That is exactly the thing I have wished 
you all to do for me, to be cheerful and perfectly resigned to the holy 
will of a wise and good God. I bless his most holy name that I am, 
I trust, in some good measure able to do the same. I am even " joyful in all my tribulations" ever since my confinement, and I humbly 
trust that " I know in whom I have trusted." A calm peace, per 
haps like that which your own dear mother felt in view of her last 
change, seems to fill my mind by day and by night. Of this neither 
the powers of "earth or hell" can deprive me. Do not, my dear 
children, any of you grieve for a single moment on my account. As 
I trust my life has not been thrown away, so I also humbly trust 
that my death will not be in vain. God can make it to be a thousand 
times more valuable to his own cause than all the miserable service 
(at best) that I have rendered it during my life. When I was first 
taken, I was too feeble to write much; so I wrote what I could to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=north elba" rel="city">North Elba</a>,, requesting Ruth and Anne to send you copies of all my 
letters to them. I hope they have done so, and that you, Ellen, 1 will 
do the same with what I may send to you, as it is still quite a labor 
for me to write all that I need to. I want your brothers to know 
what I write, if you know where to reach them. I wrote Jeremiah 
a few days since to supply a trifling assistance, fifteen dollars, to such 
of you as might be most destitute. I got his letter, but do not know 
as he got mine. I hope to get another letter from him soon. I also 
asked him to show you my letter. I know of nothing you can any of 
you now do for me, unless it is to comfort your own hearts, and cheer 
and encourage each other to trust in God and Jesus Christ whom he 
hath sent. If you will keep his sayings, you shall certainly "know of 
his doctrine, whether it be of God or no." Nothing can be more grateful to me than your earnest sympathy, except it be to know that you 
are fully persuaded to be Christians. And now, dear children, fare 
well for this time. I hope to be able to write you again. The God 
of my fathers take you for his children. 
</p><p>

THE REV. MCFARLAND. 
</p><p>
DEAR FRIEND, Although you write to me as a stranger, the 
spirit you show towards me and the cause for which I am in bonds 
makes me feel towards you as a dear friend. I would be glad to have 
you or any of my liberty-loving ministerial friends here, to talk and 
pray with me. I am not a stranger to the way of salvation by Christ. 
From my youth I have studied much on that subject, and at one time 
hoped to be a minister myself; but God had another work for me to 
do. To me it is given, in behalf of Christ, not only to believe on 
him, but also to suffer for his sake. But while I trust that I have 
some experimental and saving knowledge of religion, it would be a 
great pleasure to me to have some one better qualified than myself to 
lead my mind in prayer and meditation, now-that my time is so near 
a close. You may wonder, are there no ministers of the gospel here? 
I answer, no. There are no ministers of Christ here. These ministers who profess to be Christian, and hold slaves or advocate slavery, 
I cannot abide them. My knees will not bend in prayer with them, 
while their hands are stained with the blood of souls. The subject 
you mention as having been preaching on the day before you wrote 
to me is one which I have often thought of since my imprisonment. 
I think I feel as happy as Paul did when he lay in prison. He knew 
if they killed him, it would greatly advance the cause of Christ ; that 
was the reason he rejoiced so. On that same ground " I do rejoice, 
yea, and will rejoice." Let them hang me ; I forgive them, and may 
God forgive them, for they know not what they do. I have no regret 
for the transaction for which I am condemned. I went against the 
laws of men, it is true, but " whether it be right to obey God or 
men, judge ye." Christ told me to remember them that were in 
bonds as. bound with them, to do towards them as I would wish 
them to do towards me in similar circumstances. My conscience 
bade me do that. I tried to do it, but failed. Therefore I have no 
regret on that score. I have no sorrow either as to the result, only 
for my poor wife and children. They have suffered much, and it is 
hard to leave them uncared for. But God will be a husband to the 
widow and a father to the fatherless. 
</p><p>
I have frequently been in Wooster, and if any of my old friends 
from about <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> are there, you can show them this letter. I have 
but a few more days, and I feel anxious to be away u where the wicked 
cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest." Farewell. 
Your friend, and the friend of all friends of liberty,

</p><p>
MY DEAR MRS. SPRING, Your ever welcome letter of the 19th 
inst., together with the one now enclosed, were received by me last 
night too late for any reply. I am always grateful for anything you 
either do or write. I would most gladly express my gratitude to you 
and yours by something more than words ; but it has come to that, I 
now have but little else to deal in, and sometimes they are not so 
kind as they should be. You have laid me and my family under 
many and great obligations. I hope they may not soon be forgotten. 
The same is also true of a vast many others, that I shall never be 
able even to thank. I feel disposed to leave the education of my dear 
children to their mother, and to those dear friends who bear the bur 
den of it; only expressing my earnest hope that they may all be 
come strong, intelligent, expert, industrious, Christian housekeepers. 
I would wish that, together with other studies, they may thoroughly 
study Dr. Franklin's " Poor Richard." I want them to become 
matter-of-fact women. Perhaps I have said too much about this 
already j I would not allude to this subject now but for the fact that 
you had most kindly expressed your generous feelings with regard 
to it. 
</p><p>
I sent the letter to my wife to your care, because the address she 
sent me from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> was not sufficiently plain, and left me 
quite at a loss. I am still in the same predicament, and were I not 
ashamed to trouble you farther, would ask you either to send this to 
her or a copy of it, in order that she may see something from me 
often. 
</p><p>
I have very many interesting visits from proslavory persons almost 
daily, and I endeavor to improve them faithfully, plainly, and kindly. 
I do not think that I ever enjoyed life better than since my confinement here. For this I am indebted to Infinite Grace, and the kind 
letters of friends from different quarters. I wish I could only know 
that all my poor family were as much composed and as happy as I. 
I think that nothing but the Christian religion can ever make any 
one so much composed. 
</p><p>
" My willing soul would stay 
In such a frame as this." 
</p><p>
There are objections to my writing many things while here that I 
might be disposed to write were I under different circumstances. I do 
not know that my wife yet understands that prison rules require that 
all I write or receive should first be examined by the sheriff or State's 
attorney, and that all company 1 see should be attended by the jailer 
or some of his assistants. Yet such is the case; and did she know 
this, it might influence her mind somewhat about the opportunity she 
would have on coming here. We cannot expect the jailer to devote 
very much time to us, as he has now a very hard task on his hands. I 
have just learned how to send letters to my wife near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
I have a son at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a>, Ohio, that I greatly desire to have located 
in such a neighborhood as yours ; and you will pardon me for giving 
you some account of him, making all needful allowance for the 
source the account comes from. His name is Jason; he is about 
thirty-six years old; has a wife and one little boy. He is a very laborious, ingenious, temperate, honest, and truthful man. He is very 
expert as a gardener, vine-dresser, and manager of fruit-trees, but 
does not pride himself on account of his skill in anything ; always 
has underrated himself; is bashful and retiring in his habits; is not 
(like his father) too much inclined to assume and dictate ; is too conscientious in his dealings and too tender of people's feelings to get 
from them his just deserts, and is very poor. He suffered almost 
everything on tne way to and while in Kansas but death, and re 
turned to Ohio not a spoiled but next to a ruined man. He never 
quarrels, and yet I know that he is both morally and physically 
brave. He will not deny his principles to save his life, and he 
" turned not back in the day of battle." At the battle of Osawatomie he fought by my side. He is a most tender, loving, and 
steadfast friend, and on the right side of rhings in general, a practical 
Samaritan (if not Christian) ; and could I know that he was located 
with a population who were disposed to encourage him, without expecting him to pay too dearly in the end for it, I should feel greatly 
relieved. His wife is a very neat, industrious, prudent woman, who 
has undergone a severe trial in " the school of affliction." 
</p><p>
You make one request of me that I shall not be able to comply 
with. Am sorry that I cannot at least explain. Your own account 
of my plans is very well. The sou I mentioned has now a small 
stock of choice vines and fruit-trees, and in them consists his worldly 
store mostly. I would give you some account of others, but I sup 
pose my wife may have done so.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, Your kind letter of the 22d instant is received. I 
exceedingly regret my inability to make you some other acknowledgment for all your efforts in my behalf than that which consists merely 
in words ; but so it is. May God and a good conscience be your 
continual reward. I really do not see what you can do for me any 
further. I commend my poor family to the kind remembrance of all 
friends, but I well understand that they are not the only poor in our 
world. I ought to begin to leave off saying " our world." I have 
but very little idea of the charges made against Mr. Griswold, as I 
get to see but little of what is afloat. I am very sorry for any wrong 
that may be done him, but I have no means of contradicting any 
thing that may be said, not knowing what is said. I cannot see 
how it should be any more dishonorable for him to receive some 
compensation for his expenses and service than for Mr. Chilton, and 
I am not aware that any blame is attached to him on that score. I 
am getting more letters constantly than I well know how to answer. 
My kind friends appear to have very wrong ideas of my condition, as 
regards replying to all the kind communications I receive. 
Your friend in truth,

REV. HEMAN HUMPHREY, D.D. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR AND HONORED KINSMAN, Your very sorrowful, kind, 
and faithful letter of the 20th instant is now before me. I accept it 
with all kindness. I have honestly endeavored to profit by the faithful advice it contains. Indeed, such advice could never come amiss. 
You will allow me to say that I deeply sympathize with you and all 
my sorrowing friends in their grief and terrible mortification. I feel 
ten times more afflicted on their account than on account of my own 
circumstances. But I must say that I am neither conscious of be 
ing " infatuated " nor " mad." You will doubtless agree with me in 
this, that neither imprisonment, irons, nor the gallows falling to 
one's lot are of themselves evidence of either guilt, " infatuation, 
or madness." 
</p><p>
I discover that you labor under a mistaken impression as to some 
important facts, which my peculiar circumstances will in all probability prevent the possibility of my removing ; and I do not propose 
to take up any argument to prove that any motion or act of my life 
is right. But I will here state that I know it to be wholly my own 
fault as a leader that caused our disaster. Of this you have no proper 
means of judging, not being on the ground, or a practical soldier. I 
will only add, that it was in yielding to my feelings of humanity 
(if I ever exercised such a feeling), in leaving my proper place and 
mingling with my prisoners to quiet their fears, that occasioned our 
being caught. I firmly believe that God reigns, and that he over 
rules all things in the best possible manner ; and in that view of the 
subject I try to be in some degree reconciled to my own weaknesses 
and follies even. 
</p><p>
If you were here on the spot, and could be with me by day and by 
night, and know the facts and how my time is spent here, I think 
you would find much to reconcile your own mind to the ignominious 
death I am about to suffer, and to mitigate your sorrow. I am, to 
say the least, quite cheerful. " He shall begin to deliver Israel out 
of the hand of the Philistines." This was said of a poor erring servant many years ago ; and for many years I have felt a strong impression that God had given me powers and faculties, unworthy as 
I was, that he intended to use for a similar purpose. This most 
unmerited honor He has seen fit to bestow ; and whether- like the 
same poor frail man to whom I allude, my death may not be of vastly 
more value than my life is, I think quite beyond all human foresight. 
I really have strong hopes that notwithstanding all my many sins, I 
too may yet die " in faith." 
</p><p>
If you do not believe I had a murderous intention (while I know I 
had not), why grieve so terribly on my account? The scaffold has 
but few terrors for me. God has often covered my head in the day 
of battle, and granted me many times deliverances that were almost 
so miraculous that I can scarce realize their truth j and now, when 
it seems quite certain that he intends to use me in a different way, 
shall I not most cheerfully go? I may be deceived, but I humbly 
trust that he will not forsake me " till I have showed his favor to 
this generation and his strength to every one that is to come." Your 
letter is most faithfully and kindly written, and I mean to profit by 
it. I am certainly quite grateful for it. I feel that a great responsibility rests upon me as regards the lives of those who have fallen and 
may yet fall. I must in that view cast myself on the care of Him 
u whose mercy endureth forever." If the cause in which I engaged 
in any possible degree approximated to be " infinitely better" than 
the one which Saul of Tarsus undertook, I have no reason to be 
ashamed of it; and indeed I cannot now, after more than a month 
for reflection, find in my heart (before God in whose presence I 
expect to stand within another week) any cause for shame. 
</p><p>
I got a long and most kind letter from your pure-hearted brother 
Luther, to which I replied at some length. The statement that seems to be going around in the newspapers that I told Governor 
Wise that I came on here to seek revenge for the wrongs of either 
myself or my family, is utterly false. I never intended to convey 
such an idea, and I bless God that I am able even now to say that I 
have never yet harbored such a feeling. See testimony of witnesses 
who were with me while I had one son lying dead by my side, and 
another mortally wounded and dying on my other side. I do not 
believe that Governor Wise so understood, and I think he ought to 
correct that impression. The impression that we intended a general 
insurrection is equally untrue. 
</p><p>
Now, my much beloved and much respected kinsman, farewell. 
May the God of our fathers save and abundantly bless you and yours!

THADDEUS HYATT, ESQ.

MY DEAR SIR, Your very acceptable letter of the 24th instant 
has just been handed to me. I am certainly most obliged to you for 
it, and for all your efforts in behalf of my family and myself. I can 
form no idea of the objections to your mode of operating in their be 
half, to which my friend Dr. Webb refers ; and I suppose it is now 
too late for any explanations from him that would enlighten me. It 
(your effort) at any rate takes from my mind the greatest burden I 
have felt since my imprisonment, to feel assured that in some way 
my shattered and broken-hearted wife and children would be so far 
relieved as to save them from great physical suffering. Others may 
have devised a better way of doing it. I had no advice in regard to 
it, and felt very grateful to know, while I was yet living, of almost 
any active measure being taken. I hope no offence is taken at your- 
self or me in the matter. I am beginning to familiarize my mind 
with new and very different scenes. Am very cheerful. Farewell, 
my friend.

</p><p>
MY DEAR Miss STERNS, Your most kind and cheering letter of 
the 18th instant is received. Although I have not been at all low- 
spirited or cast down in feeling since being imprisoned and under 
sentence (which I am fully aware is soon to be carried out), it is exceedingly gratifying to learn from friends that there are not wanting 
in this generation some to sympathize with me and appreciate my 
motive, even now that I am whipped. Success is in general the 
standard of all merit. I have passed my time here quite cheerfully ; 
still trusting that neither my life nor my death will prove a total loss. 
As regards both, however, I am liable to mistake. It affords me 
some satisfaction to feel conscious of having at least tried to better 
the condition of those who are always on the under-hill side, and am 
in hopes of being able to meet the consequences without a murmur. 
I am endeavoring to get ready for another field of action, where no 
defeat befalls the truly brave. That " God reigns," and most wisely, 
and controls all events, might, it would seem, reconcile those who 
believe it to much that appears to be very disastrous. I am one who 
has tried to believe that, and still keep trying. Those who die 
for the truth may prove to be courageous at last ; so I continue 
" hoping on," till I shall find that the truth must finally prevail. 
I do not feel in the least degree despondent or degraded by my circumstances ; and I entreat my friends not to grieve on my account. 
You will please excuse a very poor and short letter, as I get more 
than I can possibly answer. I send my best wishes to your kind 
mother, and to all the family, and to all the true friends of humanity. 
And now, dear friends, God be with you all, and ever guide and 
bless you! Your friend,

</p><p>
MY DEARLY BELOVED SISTERS MARY A. AND MARTHA, I am obliged to occupy a part of what is probably my last Sabbath on 
earth in answering the very kind and comforting letters of sister 
Hand and son of the 23d inst., or I must fail to do so at all. I do 
not think it any violation of the day that God made for man. 
Nothing could be more grateful to my feelings than to learn that you 
do not feel dreadfully mortified, and even disgraced, on account of 
your relation to one who is to die on the scaffold. I have really 
suffered more, by tenfold, since my confinement here, on account of 
what I feared would be the terrible feelings of my kindred on my 
account, than from all other causes. I am most glad to learn from 
you that my fears on your own account were ill founded. I was 
afraid that a little seeming present prosperity might have carried you 
away from realities, so that " the honor that cometh from men n 
might lead you in some measure to undervalue that which "cometh 
from God." I bless God, who has most abundantly supported and 
comforted me all along, to find you are not ensnared. Dr. Heman Humphrey has just sent me a most doleful lamentation over my 
"infatuation and madness" (very kindly expressed), in which, I 
cannot doubt, he has given expression to the extreme grief of others 
of our kindred. I have endeavored to answer him kindly also, and 
at the same time to deal faithfully with my old friend. I think I 
will send you his letter ; and if you deem it worth the trouble, you 
can probably get my reply, or a copy of it. Suffice it for me to say, 
"None of these things move me." Luther Humphrey wrote me a 
very comforting letter. 
</p><p>
There are things, dear sisters, that God hides even from the wise 
and prudent. I feel astonished that one so exceedingly vile and unworthy as I am should even be suffered to have a place anyhow or 
anywhere among the very least of all who, when they come to die 
(as all must), were permitted to pay the debt of nature in defence of 
the right and of God's eternal and immutable truth. Oh, my dear 
friends, can you believe it possible that the scaffold has no terrors 
for your own poor old unworthy brother? I thank God, through 
Jesus Christ my Lord, it is even so. I am now shedding tears, but 
they are no longer tears of grief or sorrow ; I trust I have nearly 
done with those. I am weeping for joy and gratitude that I can in 
no other way express. I get many very kind and comforting letters 
that I cannot possibly reply to j wish I had time and strength to 
answer all. I am obliged to ask those to whom I do write to let 
friends read what I send as much as they well can. *Do write my 
deeply afflicted and affectionate wife. It will greatly comfort her to 
have you write her freely. She has borne up manfully under accumulated griefs. She will be most glad to know that she has not been 
entirely forgotten by my kindred. Say to all my friends that I 
am waiting cheerfully and patiently the days of my appointed time ; 
fully believing that for me now to die will be to me an infinite gain 
and of untold benefit to the cause we love. Wherefore, " be of good 
cheer," and " let not your hearts be troubled." " To him that over- 
cometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also over 
came and am set down with my Father in his throne." I wish my 
friends could know but a little of the rare opportunities I now get for 
kind and faithful labor in God's cause. I hope they have not been 
entirely lost. 
</p><p>
Now, dear friends, I have done. May the God of peace bring 
us all again from the dead! 
</p><p>
Your affectionate brother,

</p><p>
HON. D. R. TILDEN. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR, Your most kind and comforting letter of the 23d 
inst. is received. I have no language to express the feelings of gratitude and obligation I am under for your kind interest in my behalf 
ever since my disaster. The great bulk of mankind estimate each 
other's actions and motives by the measure of success or otherwise 
that attends them through life. By that rule, I have been one of 
the worst and one of the best of men. I do not claim to have been 
one of the latter, and I leave it to an impartial tribunal to decide 
whether the world has been the worse or the better for my living 
and dying in it. My present great anxiety is to get as near in readyness for a different field of action as I well can, since being in a 
good measure relieved from the fear that my poor broken-hearted 
wife and children would come to immediate want. May God reward 
a thousandfold all the kind efforts made in their behalf! I have enjoyed remarkable cheerfulness and composure of mind ever since my 
confinement ; and it is a great comfort to feel assured that I am permitted to die for a cause, not merely to pay the debt of nature, as 
all must. I feel myself to be most unworthy of so great distinction. 
The particular manner of dying assigned to me gives me but very 
little uneasiness. I wish I had the time and the ability to give you, 
my dear friend, some little idea of what is daily, and I might almost 
say hourly, passing within my prison walls : and could my friends 
but witness only a few of these scenes, just as they occur, I think 
they would feel very well reconciled to my being here, just what I 
am, and just as I am. My whole life before had not afforded me one 
half the opportunity to plead for the right. In this, also, I find much 
to reconcile me to both my present condition and my immediate 
prospect. I may be very insane ; and I am so, if insane at all. But 
if that be so, insanity is like a very pleasant dream to me. I am not 
in the least degree conscious of my ravings, of my fears, or of any 
terrible visions whatever ; but fancy myself entirely composed, and 
that my sleep, in particular, is as sweet as that of a healthy, joyous 
little infant. I pray God that he will grant me a continuance of 
the same calm but delightful dream, until I come to know of those 
realities which eyes have not seen and which ears have not heard. 
I have scarce realized that I am in prison or in irons at all. I certainly think I was never more cheerful in my life. 
</p><p>
I intend to take the liberty of sending by express to your care 
some trifling articles for those of my family who may be in Ohio, 
which you can hand to my brother Jeremiah when you may see him, 
together with fifteen dollars I have asked him to advance to them. 
Please excuse me so often troubling you with my letters or any of 
my matters. Please also remember me most kindly to Mr. Griswold, 
and to all others who love their neighbors. I write Jeremiah to 
your care. Your friend in truth,

MY DEAR COVENANTER [Rev. A. M. Milligan], Notwithstand 
ing I now get daily more than three times the number of kind letters 
I can possibly answer, I cannot deny myself the satisfaction of say 
ing a few words to a stranger, whose feelings and whose judgment 
so nearly coincide with my own. No letter, of a great number I 
have got to cheer, encourage, and advise me, has given more heart 
warming satisfaction or better counsel than your own. I hope to 
profit by it ; and I am greatly obliged for this your visit to my 
prison. It really seemed to impart new strength to my soul, notwithstanding I was very cheerful before. I trust, dear brother, that God, 
in infinite grace and mercy for Christ's sake, will neither leave me 
nor forsake me till I " have showed His power to this generation, 
and his strength to every one that is to come." I would most gladly 
commune further as we journey on j but I am so near the close of 
mine that I must break off, however reluctant. 
</p><p>
Farewell, my faithful brother in Christ Jesus! Farewell!

MY DEAR FRIEND, No letter I have received since my imprisonment here has given me more satisfaction or comfort than yours 
of the 8th instant. I am quite cheerful, and was never more happy. 
Have only time to write a word. May God forever reward you and 
all yours! My love to all who love their neighbors. I have asked 
to be spared from having any weak or hypocritical prayers made 
over me when I am publicly murdered, and that my only religious 
attendants be poor little dirty, ragged, bareheaded, and barefooted 
slave boys and girls, led by some old gray-headed slave mother. 
Farewell! Farewell!

J. Q. ANDERSON, ESQ. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR, Your letter of the 23d instant is received ; but 
notwithstanding it would afford me the utmost pleasure to answer 
it at length, it is not in my power to write you but a few words. 
Jeremiah G. Anderson was fighting bravely by my side at Harper's 
Ferry up to the moment when I fell wounded, and I took no further 
notice of what passed for a little time. 1 I have since been told that 
</p><p>
1 At this point may be introduced the letter of an eye-witness of what 
happened during this "little time," when the hero had swooned from loss 
of blood and pain, and was believed to be dead. Mr. Tayleure, a South 
Carolinian, wrote thus to John Brown, Jr., six years ago : 
</p><p>
864 BROADWAY, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, June 15, 1879. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, Duty took me to Harper's Ferry at the time of the raid in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1859">1859</a> (I was 
then connected with the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> Press), and by chance I was brought into close personal contact with both your father and your brother <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a>. After the assault I 
assisted your father to rise, as he stumbled forward out of the historic engine-house ; 
and was able to administer to your brother, just before he died, some physical comfort, 
which won me his thanks. Subsequent to the capture of the party, I accompanied 
Captain J. E. B. Stuart and the battalion he commanded to the Kennedy farm ; and 
there, by another strange chance, I came into possession of a number of papers belong 
ing to your father. These I afterwards delivered to Governor Wise, upon his requisition ; 
but there yet remains in my possession an old manifold letter-writer which belonged to 
your father. In this are several letters, in .his handwriting, entitled "Sambo's Mis 
takes," written, apparently, for publication, and addressed "To the Editor of the 
Ramshorn. " They contain a satirical summing up, related in the first person, of the 
mistakes and weaknesses common to the colored people. This book, together with a 
common carpet-bag, a red and white check blanket, a rifle, pistol, and pike, all of 
which I found at the Kennedy house, I kept, and yet have, I think, as mementos of 
that tragic, affair. Two or three years ago I read in one of the magazines <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met">Owen Brown's </a>
relation of his escape from the Ferry, and was minded to supplement it with my narrative of the capture and its incidents, but the many demands upon my time prevented 
my doing so. 
</p><p>
I am a South Carolinian, and at the time of the raid was very deeply imbued with 
the political prejudices of my State ; but the serenity, calm courage, and devotion to 
duty which your father and his followers then manifested impressed me very profoundly. It is impossible not to feel respect for men who offer up their lives in support 
of their convictions ; and the earnestness of my respect I put upon record in a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> paper the day succeeding the event. I gave your brother a cup of water to quench 
his thirst (this was at about 7.30 on the morning of the capture), and improvised a 
couch for him out of a bench, with a pair of overalls for a pillow. I remember how he 
looked, singularly handsome, even through the grime of his all-day struggles, aud the 
he was mortally wounded at the same moment, and died in a short 
time afterwards. I believe this information is correct ; but I have 
no means of knowing from any acquaintances, not being allowed intercourse with other prisoners, except one. The same is true as to 
the death of one of my own sons. I have no doubt but both are 
dead. Your friend, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">JOHN BROWN</a>.

MY DEAR SIR, Your most kind letter of the 24th instant is received. It does indeed give me u pleasure " and the greatest encouragement to know of any efforts that have been made in behalf of my 
poor and deeply afflicted family. It takes from my mind the greatest 
cause of sadness I have experienced during my imprisonment here. 
I feel quite cheerful, and ready to die. I can only say, for want of

remember all those to whom we are so deeply indebted!

Nov. 30, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1859">1859</a>. 
</p><p>
MY DEARLY BELOVED WlFE, SONS, AND DAUGHTERS, EVERY 
</p><p>
ONE, As I now begin probably what is the last letter I shall ever 
write to any of you, I conclude to write to all at the same time. I 
will mention some little matters particularly applicable to little 
property concerns in another place. 
</p><p>
I recently received a letter from my wife, from near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, 
dated November 22, by which it would seem that she was about 
giving up the idea of seeing me again. I had written her to come 
on if she felt equal to the undertaking, but I do not know that she 
will get my letter in time. It was on her own account, chiefly, that 
1 asked her to stay back. At first I had a most strong desire to see 
her again, but there appeared to be very serious objections ; and 
should we never meet in this life, I trust that she will in the end be 
satisfied it was for the best at least, if not most for her comfort. 
</p><p>
I am waiting the hour of my public murder with great composure 
of mind and cheerfulness; feeling the strong assurance that in no 
other possible way could I be used to so much advantage to the 
cause of God and of humanity, and that nothing that either I or all 
my family have sacrificed or suffered will he lost. The reflection 
that a wise and merciful as well as just and holy God rules not only 
the affairs of this world but of all worlds, is a rock to set our feet 
upon under all circumstances, even those more severely trying ones 
in which our own feelings and wrongs have placed us. I have now 
no doubt but that our seeming disaster will ultimately result in the 
most glorious success. So, my dear shattered and broken family, be 
of good cheer, and believe and trust in God with all your heart 
and with all your soul ; for He doeth all things well. Do not feel 
ashamed on my account, nor for one moment despair of the cause or 
grow weary of well-doing. I bless God I never felt stronger confidence in the certain and near approach of a bright morning and glorious day than I have felt, and do now feel, since my confinement 
here. I am endeavoring to return, like a poor prodigal as I am, to 
my Father, against whom I have always sinned, in the hope that 
he may kindly and forgivingly meet me, though a very great way 
off. 
</p><p>
Oh, my dear wife and children, would to God you could know 
how I have been travailing in birth for you all, that no one of you 
may fail of the grace of God through Jesus Christ ; that no one of 
you may be blind to the truth and glorious light of his Word, in 
which life and immortality are brought to light. I beseech you, 
every one, to make the Bible your daily and nightly study, with a 
child-like, honest, candid, teachable spirit of love and respect for 
your husband and father. And I beseech the God of my fathers to 
open all your eyes to the discovery of the truth. You cannot imagine how much you may soon need the consolations of the Christian 
religion. Circumstances like my own for more than a month past 
have convinced me, beyond all doubt, of my own great need of some 
theories treasured .up, when our prejudices are excited, our vanity 
worked up to the highest pitch. Oh, do not trust your eternal all 
upon the boisterous ocean, without even a helm or compass to aid 
you in steering! I do not ask of you to throw away your reason ; 
I only ask you to make a candid, sober use of your reason. 
</p><p>
My dear young children, will you listen to this last poor admonition of one who can only love you? Oh, be determined at once to 
give your whole heart to God, and let nothing shake or alter that 
resolution. You need have no fears of regretting it. Do not be 
vain and thoughtless, but sober-minded ; and let me entreat you all 
to love the whole remnant of our once great family. Try and build 
up again your broken walls, and to make the utmost of every stone 
that is left. Nothing can so tend to make life a blessing as the consciousness that your life and example bless and leave others stronger. 
Still, it is ground of the utmost comfort to my mind to know that so 
many of you as have had the opportunity have given some proof of 
your fidelity to the great family of men. Be faithful unto death : 
from the exercise of habitual love to man it cannot be very hard to 
love his Maker. 
</p><p>
I must yet insert the reason for my firm belief in the divine inspiration of the Bible, notwithstanding I am, perhaps, naturally sceptical, certainly not credulous. I wish all to consider it most 
thoroughly when you read that blessed book, and see whether you 
cannot discover such evidence yourselves. It is the purity of heart, 
filling our minds as well as work and actions, which is everywhere 
insisted on, that distinguishes it from all the other teachings, that commiends it to my conscience. Whether my heart be willing and 
obedient or not, the inducement that it holds out is another reason of 
my conviction of its truth and genuineness ; but I do not here ornit this my last argument on the Bible, that eternal life is what my soul 
is panting after this moment. I mention this as a reason for endeavoring to leave a valuable copy of the Bible, to be carefully preserved 
in remembrance of me, to so many of my posterity, instead of some 
other book at equal cost. 
</p><p>
I beseech you all to live in habitual contentment with moderate 
circumstances and gains of worldly store, and earnestly to teach this 
to your children and children's children after you, by example as 
well as precept. Be determined to know by experience, as soon as 
may be, whether Bible instruction is of divine origin or not. Be 
sure to owe no man anything, but to love one another. John 
Rogers wrote to his children : " Abhor that arrant whore of Rome." 
John Brown writes to his children to abhor, with undying hatred 
also, that sum of all villanies, slavery. Remember, " he that is 
slow to anger is better than the mighty," and "he that ruleth his 
spirit than he that taketh a city." Remember also that " they being 
wise shall shine, and they that turn many to righteousness, as the 
stars for ever and ever." 
</p><p>
And now, dearly beloved family, to God and the work of his grace 
I commend you all. 
</p><p>
Your affectionate husband and father,

I give to my son John Brown, Jr., my surveyor's compass and 
other surveyor's articles, if found ; also, my old granite monument, 
now at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=north elba" rel="city">North Elba</a>,, N. Y., to receive upon its two sides a further inscription, as I will hereafter direct j said stone monument, however,

I give to my son Jason Brown my silver watch, with my name engraved on inner case. 
</p><p>
I give to my son <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=owb" rel="child met">Owen Brown</a> my double-spring opera-glass, and 
my rifle-gun (if found), presented to me at Worcester, Mass. It is 
globe-sighted and new. I give, also, to the same son $50 in cash, 
to be paid him from the proceeds of my father's estate, in consideration of his terrible suffering in Kansas and his crippled condition 
from his childhood. 
</p><p>
I give to my son <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=sab" rel="child met">Salmon</a> Brown $50 in cash, to be paid him from 
my father's estate, as an offset to the first two cases above named. 
</p><p>
I give to my daughter Ruth Thompson my large old Bible, containing the family record. 
</p><p>
I give to each of my sons, and to each of my other daughters, my 
son-in-law, Henry Thompson, and to each of my daughters-in-law, 
as good a copy of the Bible as can be purchased at some bookstore 
in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> or <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, at a cost of $5 each in cash, to be paid out 
of the proceeds of my father's estate. 
</p><p>
I give to each of my grandchildren that may be living when my 
father's estate is settled, as good a copy of the Bible as can be purchased (as above) at a cost of $3 each. 
</p><p>
All the Bibles to be purchased at one and the same time for cash, 
on the best terms. 
</p><p>
I desire to have $50 each paid out of the final proceeds of my 
father's estate to the following named persons, to wit : To Allan 
Hammond, Esq., of Rockville, Tolland County, Conn., or to George Kellogg, Esq., former agent of the New England Company at, that 
place, for the use and benefit of that company. Also, $50 to Silas Havens, formerly of Lewisburg, Summit County, Ohio, if he can be 
found. Also, $50 to a man of Stark County, Ohio, at Canton, who 
sued my father in his lifetime, through Judge Humphrey and Mr. Upsou of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a>, to be paid by J. R. Brown to the man in person, if 
he can be found ; his name I cannot remember. My father made 
a compromise with the man by taking our house and lot at Munroville. I desire that any remaining balance that may become my due 
from my father's estate may be paid in equal amounts to my wife 
and to each of my children, and to the widows of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wab" rel="child met">Watson</a> and Oliver
