MR. HENRY L. STEARNS. 

MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND, I have not forgotten my promise to 
write you ; but my constant care, & anxiety have obliged me to 
put it off a long time. I do not flatter myself that I can write any 
thing which will very much interest you : but have concluded to 
send you a short story of a certain boy of my acquaintance : & for 
convenience & shortness of name, I will call him John. This story 
will be mainly a narration of follies and errors; which it is to be 
hoped you may avoid ; but there is one thing connected with it, 
which will be calculated to encourage any young person to persevering effort ; & that is the degree of success in accomplishing his 
objects which to a great degree marked the course of this boy through 
out my entire acquaintance with him ; notwithstanding his moderate 
capacity; & still more moderate acquirements. 

John was born May 9th, 1800, at Torrington, Litchfield Co. Connecticut ; of poor but respectable parents : a deceudant on the side 
of his father of one of the company of the Mayflower who landed at Plymouth 1620. His mother was decended from a man who came 
at an early period to New England from Amsterdam, in Holland. Both his Father s and his Mother s Fathers served in the war of the 
revolution : His Father s Father ; died in a barn in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> while in the service ; in 1776. 

I can not tell you of anything in the first Four years of John s life worth mentioning save that at that early age he was tempted by 
Three large Brass Pins belonging to a girl who lived in the family 
& stole then}. In this he was detected by his Mother ; & after having a full day to think of the wrong; received from her a thorough 
whipping. When he was Five years old his Father moved to Ohio ; then a wilderness filled with wild beasts, & Indians. During the 
long journey, which was performed in part or mostly with an ox-team; he was called on by turns to assist a boy Five years older 
(who had been adopted by his Father & Mother) & learned to think he could accomplish smart things in driving the Cows; & riding 
the horses. Sometimes he met with Rattle Snakes which were very large; & which some of the company generally managed to kill. 
After getting to Ohio in 1805 he was for some time rather afraid of the Indians, & of their Rifles; but this soon wore off: & he used 
to hang about them quite as much as was consistent with good manners ; & learned a trifle of their talk. His father learned to 
dress Deer Skins, & at 6 years old John was installed a young Buck 
Skin. He was perhaps rather observing as he ever after remembered the entire process of Deer Skin dressing ; so that he could at 
any time dress his own leather such as Squirel, Raccoon, Cat, Wolf and Dog Skins, and also learned to make Whip Lashes, which 
brought him some change at times, & was of considerable service in many ways. At Six years old he began to be a rambler in the 
wild new country finding birds and squirrels and sometimes a wild Turkey s nest. But about this period he was placed in the school of 
adversity ; which my young friend was a most necessary part of his early training. You may laugh when you come to read about it ; 
but these were sore trials to John : whose earthly treasures were very few & small. These were the beginning of a severe but much 
needed course of dicipline which he afterwards was to pass through ; & which it is to be hoped has learned him before this time that the 
Heavenly Father sees it best to take all the little things out of his hands which he has ever placed in them. When John was in his 
Sixth year a poor Indian boy gave him a Yellow Marble the first he had ever seen. This he thought a great deal of; & kept it a good 
while ; but at last he lost it beyond recovery. It took years to heal the wound & I think he cried at times about it. About Five months 
after this he caught a young Squirrel tearing off his tail in doing it ; & getting severely bitten at the same time himself. He however 
held on to the little bob tail Squirrel ; & finally got him perfectly tamed, so that he almost idolized his pet. This too he lost ; by its 
wandering away; or by getting killed; & for a year or two John was in mourning ; and looking at all the Squirrels he could see to 
try & discover Bobtail, if possible. I must not neglect to tell you of a verry bad & foolish habbit to which John was somewhat addicted. 
I mean telling lies ; generally to screen himself from blame; or from punishment. He could not well endure to be reproached ; & I now 
think had he been oftener encouraged to be entirely frank ; by making frankness a kind of atonement for some of his faults ; he 
would not have been so often guilty of this fault ; nor have been (in after life) obliged to struggle so long with so mean a habit. 

John was never quarrelsome ; but was excessively fond of the hardest & roughest kind of plays ; & could never get enough [of] them. 
Indeed when for a short time he was sometimes sent to School the opportunity it afforded to wrestle & Snow ball & run & jump & 
knock off old seedy Wool hats ; offered to him almost the only compensation for the confinement, & restraints of school. I need not 
tell you that with such a feeling & but little chance of going to school at all: he did not become much of a schollar. He would 
always choose to stay at home & work hard rather than be sent to school; & during the warm season might generally be seen bare 
footed & bareheaded : with Buck skin Breeches suspended often with one leather strap over his shoulder but sometimes with Two. To 
be sent off through the wilderness alone to very considerable distances was particularly his delight ; & in this he was often indulged 
so that by the time he was Twelve years old he was sent off more than a Hundred Miles with companies of cattle ; & he would have 
thought his character much injured had he been obliged to be helped in any such job. This was a boyish kind of feeling but characteristic 
however. 

At Eight years old, John was left a Motherless boy which loss was complete & pearmanent for notwithstanding his Father again 
married to a sensible, intelligent, and on many accounts a very estimable woman; yet he never adopted her in feeling ; but continued 
to pine after his own Mother for years. This opperated very unfavourably uppon him ; as he was both naturally fond of females ; &, 
withall, extremely diffident ; & deprived him of a suitable connecting link between the different sexes ; the want of which might under 
some circumstances, have proved his ruin. 

When the war broke out with England, his Father soon commenced furnishing the troops with beef cattle, the collecting & driv 
ing of which afforded him some opportunity for the chase (on foot) of wild steers & other cattle through the woods. During this war 
he had some chance to form his own boyish judgment of men & measures : & to become somewhat familiarly acquainted with some who 
have figured before the country since that time. The effect of what he saw during the w r ar was to so far disgust him with Military affairs 
that he would neither train, or drill ; but paid fines ; & got along like a Quaker until his age finally has cleared him of Military duty. 

During the war with England a circumstance occurred that in the 
end made him a most determined Abolitionist: & led him to declare, 
or Swear : Eternal war with Slavery. He was staying for a short 
time with a very gentlemanly landlord since a United States Marshall 
who held a slave boy near his own age very active, inteligent and 
good feeling ; & to whom John was under considerable obligation 
for numerous little acts of kindness. The master made a great pet 
of John: brought him to table with his first company; & friends; 
called their attention to every little smart thing he said or did: & 
to the fact of his being more than a hundred miles from home with a 
company of cattle alone ; w r hile the negro boy (who was fully if not 
more than his equal) was badly clothed, poorly fed ; & lodged in cold weather ; & beaten before his eyes with Iron Shovels or any other 
thing that came first to hand. This brought John to reflect on the 
wretched, hopeless condition, of Fatherless & Motherless slave children : for such children have neither Fathers or Mothers to protect, 
& provide for them. He sometimes would raise the question is Gofl their Father f 

At the age of Ten years an old friend induced him to read a little 
history, & offered him the free use of a good library ; by ; which 
he acquired some taste for reading : which formed the principle part 
of his early education : & diverted him in a great measure from bad 
company. He by this means grew to be verry fond of the company, 
& conversation of old & intelligent persons. He never attempted to 
dance in his life; nor did he ever learn to know one of a pack of Cards 
from another. He learned nothing of Grammer j nor did he get at 
school so much knowledge of common Arithmetic as the Four ground 
rules. This will give you some general idea of the first Fifteen years 
of his life; during which time he became very strong & large of his 
age & ambitious to perform the full labour of a man ; at almost any 
kind of hard work. By reading the lives of great, wise & good men 
their sayings, and writings; he grew to a dislike of vain & frivolous 
conversation & persons; & was often greatly obliged by the kind 
manner in which older & more iuteligent persons treated him at 
their houses : & in conversation ; which was a great relief on account 
of his extreme bashfulness. 

He very early in life became ambitious to excel in doing anything 
he undertook to perform. This kind of feeling I would recommend 
to all young persons both male & female: as it will certainly tend 
to secure admission to the company of the more inteligeut ; & better 
portion of every community. By all means endeavour to excel in 
some laudable pursuit. 

I had like to have forgotten to tell you of one of John s misfortunes 
which set rather hard on him while a young boy. He had by some 
moans perhaps by gift of his father become the owner of a little Ewe 
Lamb which did finely till it was about Two Thirds grown ; & then 
sickened & died. This brought another protracted mourning season : 
not that he felt the pecuniary loss so much : for that was never his 
disposition ; but so strong & earnest were his atachments- 

John had been taught from earliest childhood to " fear God and 
keep his commandments j " & though quite skeptical he had always 
by turns felt much serious doubt as to his future well being ; & about 
this time became to some extent a convert to Christianity & ever 
after a firm believer in the divine authenticity of the Bible. With 
this book he became very familiar, & possessed a most unusual 
memory of its entire contents. 

Now some of the things I have been telling of; were just such 
as I would recommend to you : & I would like to know that you had 
selected these out ; & adopted them as part of your own plan of life ; 
& I wish you to have some deffinite plan. Many seem to have 
none ; & others never stick to .any that they do form. This was not 
the case with John. He followed up^with tenacity whatever he set 
about, so long as it answered his general purpose : & hence he rarely 
failed in some good degree to effect the things he undertook. This 
was so much the case that he habitually expected to succeed in his 
undertakings. With this feeling should be coupled ; the consciousness 
that our plans are right in themselves. 

During the period I have named, John had acquired a kind of 
ownership to certain animals of some little value but as he had come 
to understand that the title of minors might be a little imperfect : he 
had recourse to various means in order to secure a more independent; 
& perfect right of property. One of those means was to exchange 
with his Father for something of far less value. Another was by 
trading with others persons for something his Father had never 
owned. Older persons have some times found difficulty with titles. 

From Fifteen to Twenty years old, he spent most of his time work 
ing at the Tanner & Currier s trade keeping Bachelors hall } & he 
officiating as Cook ; & for most of the time as foreman of the establishment under his Father. During this period he found much trouble 
with some of the bad habits I have mentioned & with some that I 
have not told you off: his conscience urging him forward with great 
power in this matter : but his close attention to business ; & success 
in its management ; together with the way he got along with a company of men, & boys ; made him quite a favorite with the serious & 
more inteligent portion of older persons. This was so much the case ; 
& secured for him so many little notices from those he esteemed ; 
that his vanity was very much fed by it : & he came forward to man 
hood quite full of self-conceit ; & self-confident; notwithstanding his 
extreme bashfulness. A younger brother 1 used sometimes to remind 
him of this : & to repeat to him this expression which you may some 
where find, a A King against whom there is no rising up." The 
habit so early formed of being obeyed rendered him in after life too 
much disposed to speak in an imperious or dictating way. From Fifteen years & upward he felt a good deal of anxiety to learn ; but could 
only read & study a little ; both for want of time ; & on account of inflammation of the eyes. He however managed by the help of books 
to make himself tolerably well acquainted with common arithmetic ; & Surveying j which he practiced more or less after he was Twenty years old. 

At a little past Twenty years led by his own inclination & 
prompted also by his Father, he married a remarkably plain ; but 
neat industrious & economical girl ; of excellent character ; earnest 
piety ; & good practical common sense ; about one year younger than 
himself. This woman by her mild, frank, & more than all else: 
by her very consistent conduct; acquired & ever while she lived 
maintained a most powerful ; & good influence over him. Her plain 
but kind admonitions generally had the right effect ; without arousing 
his haughty obstinate temper. John began early in life to discover a 
great liking to fine Cattle, Horses, Sheep, & Swine; & as soon as 
circumstances would enable him he began to be a practical Shep 
herd: it being a calling for which in early life he had a kind of 
enthusiastic longing : together with the idea that as a business it bid 
fair to afford him the means of carrying out his greatest or principal 
object. I have now given you a kind of general idea of the early life 
of this boy ; & if I believed it would be worth the trouble ; or afford 
much interest to any good feeling person: I might be tempted to 
tell you something of his course in after life ; or manhood. I do not 
say that I will do it. 

You will discover that in using up my half sheets to save paper ; I have written Two pages, so that one does not follow the other as it 
should. I have no time to write it over; & but for unavoidable hindrances in traveling I can hardly say when I should have written 
what I have. With an honest desire for your best good, I subscribe myself, 

Your Friend, 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">J. BROWN</a>. 

P. S. I had like to have forgotten to acknowledge your contribution in aid of the cause in which I serve. God Almighty bless you ; my son.

Letter of Owen Brown to John Brown. 

HUDSON (OHIO), March 27, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1856">1856</a> 

DEAR SON JOHN, I received yours of 13th on the 25th, and was 
very glad to larn that all your Famelys were so well, and that you had 
not been distourbed by the enemy. Your letters come very regular, 
and we look carfuly after them. I have been faithfull to answer 

1 It was after hearing this letter read that Miss Osgood, of Medford, re 
marked, " If Captain Brown had not been called, in the providence of God, 
to a very different work, what charming stories he could have written for 
young children ! " The original manuscript tills six pages of closely wait- 
ten letter-paper, without division into paragraphs. The contributions 
made by Harry Stearns and by others " in aid of the cause in which I 
serve," were given to help the oppressed pioneers of Kansas whom Brown 
was then defending. His father, Owen Brown, as a beef contractor, was 
with Hull s army at or just before the surrender at Detroit in 1812, accompanied by his son John. John, then twelve years old, circulated among the 
American soldiers and officers, and overheard many conversations in camp 
them, not out of ambishon, but to keep one or more on the road all 
the time. My health at present is not so good; for three weeks past I 
am somewhat put to it to breathe, mostly nights, and sometimes feel as 
though death was at the dore. I feel as though God was very merso- 
full to keep such a great sinner on probation so long. I ask all of 
you to pray more earnestly for the salvation of my soul than for the 
life of my body, and that I may give myself and all 1 have up to 
Christ, and honer him by a sacrafise of all we have. 

I think that the moovments of Congress will prevent an invasion 
of your rights ; they have voted to send to Kansas to investigate the 
situation [and] elections. I think of cliping from some papers some 
short Acts of Congress and inclose them in a private letters and send 
them to you. I think I shall have them very regular. I wrote Mr. Giddeons about 3 weeks ago to send me the debats and Acts of Congress on the subjects of Kansas from time to time. He was at home then sick, but has now returned to Con [in John Brown s hand 
11 Washington " is written in before " Con "] and the papers begin to come. 

Friends are midling well as far as I know. I am now at Ed 
ward s ; it is rather a cold, stormy day. We have had a remarkable 
cold, snowe winter, and the snow is mostly on the ground now. We 
have 3 only plesent dayes this week, but have had no rain through 
the winter. I consider all of my Children at Kansas as one Famely, 
and hope you will take turns in writeing. They are midling well at 
Edward s, and wish to be remembered. 

Your unfaithful Parent, 

OWEN BROWN.

DEAR FATHER, Yours of the 22d, telling us of the death of 
"brother King, is received. I must say, that, with all his imperfections 
and faults, I certainly feel that if he has not been a very warm 
hearted, yet he has been a steady, friend, and on some accounts a 
useful friend; and I mourn his frailties and death sincerely. You 
say he expected to die, but do not say how he felt in regard to the 
change as it drew near. I have to confess my unfaithfulness to my 
friend in regard to his most important interest. I did not fail to write 
you, as soon as I returned myself, from want of inclination, but be 
cause I thought it would please you quite as much to get a letter from 
Jason. We are getting along moderately with our business, but when 
we shall be able to close it up will be difficult to say, for we still 
continue to receive large quantities of wool. Prices rather improve. 
We expect to be ready to close up all the lots Jerry brought on in a 
very few days. Have contracted away the lowest he brought at 
twenty-five cents per pound. There is no doubt but we might make 
the most advantageous exchanges of wool for any description of 
woollen goods that are wanted in the country. We shall probably 
take hold of the business with a view to such exchanges another year, 
if we continue the wool business. We find no difficulty in disposing 
of the very coarsest wools, now that we have learned better where to 
sell them, and can turn them cash. Please write often, and let us hear 
how you all get along, and what you think proper to say to us. 
Your affectionate son,

DEAR FATHER, Yours, dated 2d and 3d December, we received this evening. It is perhaps needless for me to say that I am 
always grateful for everything of that kind I receive from you, and that I think I have your whole correspondence for nearly thirty years 
laid up to remember you by, I mean, of course, what you have directed to me. I would further say, that I feel grateful to you, and my 
brother, for calling to see my dear afflicted wife and children in their calamity. It is a great comfort that / can in my imagination see my 
always kind and affectionate old father with them, while at the same time the responsibilities I have assumed constrain me to be absent, 
very contrary to my feeling (and it may be contrary to my duty, too ; but trust not). I mean to return sometime in February, and should 
feel like one out of prison could I leave to-morrow. I hope you will visit my family as often as you can during my absence, and that you 
will write us often while here. We will endeavor, one of us, to reply promptly at least. We are getting along with our business slowly, 
but prudently, I trust, and as well as we could reasonably expect under all the circumstances ; and so far as we can discover, we are 
in favor with this people, and also with the many we have had to do business with. I sent home a good supply of excellent cloth for 
pantaloons, from which you can have some if it suits you, and should arrive safe. If it does not, please write me without delay. Jason 
took the cloth with him (cost eighty-five cents per yard). I can bring more cloth of almost any kind when I return, should there be need. 

When I think how very little influence I have even tried to use with my numerous acquaintances and friends, in turning their minds 
toward God and heaven, I feel justly condemned as a most wicked and slothful servant ; and the more so, as I have very seldom had 
any one refuse to listen when I earnestly called him to hear. I sometimes have dreadful reflections about having fled to go down to Tarshish. 

Affectionately yours, 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">JOHN BROWN</a>.

DEAR FATHER, Your very kind as well as rational letter I received last evening. I trust I do in some measure realize that only 
a few, a very few, years will of necessity bring to me a literal accomplishment of the sayings of the Preacher. I am quite sensible of the 
truth of your remark, that my family are quite as well off as though we possessed millions. I hope we may not be left to a feeling of 
ingratitude, or greediness of gain ; and I feel unconscious of a desire to become rich. I hope my motive for exerting myself is higher. 
I feel no inclination to move my family to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a> on account of any change that I am itching for, and think it very doubtful whether 
I ever conclude on it as the best course. My only motive would be to have them with me, if I continue in my present business, which I 
am by no means attached to. I seem to get along middling well, and hope to return in a short time. Wrote Jeremiah some days since. 
I shall pay ten cents very cheerfully to hear that you are alive and well, at any time j and should not grudge to pay more for such kind 
and ever seasonable pointing me to the absolute vanity of this world s treasures, as well as the solemn future which is before me. It affords 
me great satisfaction to get a letter from you at this period of your life, so handsomely written, so well worded, and so exactly in point, 
both as to manner and (what is much more) matter. I intend to preserve it carefully. 

Your affectionate son,

DEAR FATHER, After some three or four days delay on the road, we arrived here safe to-day about noun, and found all here well; 
but our hard hearts are never thankful as they should be. Always dependent and constantly receiving, we arc ungrateful enough to be 
cast off, if that were our only fault ! Our business, so far as I can judge, has gone along middling well during my absence. Watson is 
not yet very stout, but is perhaps a little improved since I left. We shall all be anxious to hear from Lucian, and from you all, and how 
you got home from Austinburg, as soon and as often as we can. 

Affectionately yours,

DEAR FATHER, Yours of the 9th November was received a few 
days since, but I have delayed writing on two accounts since receiving 
it. One is the greater press of business, and increased anxiety on 
account of the sudden change in money matters j the other, that it is 
always hard for me to make out a letter without something to make it 
out of. We have been middling well since I returned, except John 
and Watson. John has had a short turn of fever, and Watson has 
seemed to have a number of complaints, but both are better now. Our 
business seems to be going on middling well, and will not probably 
be any the worse for the pinch in the money concerns. I trust that 
getting or losing money does not entirely engross our attention ; but 
T am sensible that it occupies quite too large a share in it. To get a 
little property together to leave, as the world have done, is really 
a low mark to be tiring at through life. 

" A nobler toil may I sustain, 
A nobler satisfaction gain." 

You wrote us that Lucian seemed to decline. This is not unexpected ; but we hope that a life still lengthened may not all be misspent, and that the little of duty to God and mankind it may yet be 
in his power to do may be done with his might, and that the Lord Jesus Christ will be the end of the law for righteousness, for that 
which must be left undone. This is the only hope for us bankrupts, as we may see at once if we will but look at our account. We hope 
to hear how you all are again soon.

DEAR FATHER, It is Sabbath evening ; and as I have waited 
now a long time expecting a letter from you, I have concluded to 
wait no longer for you to write to me. I received the Hudson paper 
giving an account of the death of another of our family. I expected 
to get a letter from you, and so have been waiting ever since getting 
the paper. I never seemed to possess a faculty to console and com 
fort my friends in their .grief; I am inclined, like the poor comforters 
of Job, to sit down in silence, lest in my miserable way I should only 
add to their grief. Another feeling that I have in your case, is an 
entire consciousness that I can bring before your mind no new source 
of consolation, nor mention any which, I trust, you have not long 
since made full proof of. I need not say that I know how to sympathize with you j for that you equally well understand. I will only 
utter one word of humble confidence, " Though He slay me, yet 
will I trust in Jlim, and bless His name forever." We are all in 
health here, but have just been taking another lesson on the uncertainty of all we hold here. One week ago yesterday, Oliver found 
some root of the plant called hemlock, that he supposed was carrot, 
and eat some of it. In a few minutes he was taken with vomiting 
and dreadful convulsions, and soon became senseless. However, bj 
resorting to the most powerful emetics he was recovered from it, like 
one raised from the dead, almost. 

The country in this direction has been suffering one of the severest money pressures known for many years. The consequence to us 
has been, that some of those who have contracted for wool of us are 
as yet unable to pay for and take the wool as they agreed, and we 
are on that account unable to close our business. This, with some 
trouble and perplexity, is the greatest injury we have suffered by it. 
We have had no winter as yet scarcely, the weather to-day being 
almost as warm as summer. We want to hear how you all are very 
much, and all about how you get along. I hope to visit you in the 
spring. Farewell. 

Your affectionate, unworthy son,

DEAR FATHER, I write you at this time more because you 
said in your last that you u love letters more now than ever before," 
than on account of anything I have to write. W are here all middling well, except our youngest child, who has been quite feeble since 
last fall. Owen s arm seems to be improving slowly. We have 
been selling wool middling fast of late, on contract, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a> prices. 
We have in this part of the country the strongest proofs that the great 
majority have made gold their hope, their only hope. I think that 
almost every product of industry will soon become high, from the 
fact alone that such a vast number of those who have hitherto been 
producers will cease to be so, and hereafter, for a time at least, be 
only consumers. I am inclined to think that persons who are in 
debt, and who hold any property of value, are likely to have a most 
favorable time to get out of debt. Would it not be well to have 
the word go round amongst all the Browns, that they may get ready 
to sell off enough of something to pay all debts ? I really wish that 
Oliver and Frederick 1 would take the hint, and when things get up 
(which I feel confident they will do), go at once to selling off and 
paying up. There is no way of making money so easy as by selling 
when every one wants to buy. It may cost us some little sacrifice of 
feeling at first, but would open a new world almost, if thoroughly 
done. 

I have felt a good deal of anxiety about the injury you received 
on your way home ; was glad to hear that you was in any measure 
comfortable. I did not intend to put off writing so long j but I al 
ways find it exceedingly hard work to write when I have nothing to 
communicate that is worth as much as the paper and postage. Your 
letters are not of so barren a character ; so that we shall not expect 
you to pay the postage when you write, which we hope will be often. 
Your affectionate but unworthy son,

DEAR BROTHER, I arrived at home without any mishap on 
Saturday of the week I left you, and found all well. I had received 
newspapers from Thibodeauxville during my ahsence, similar to those 
sent to father, but no letters respecting the death of our brother. I 
believe I was to write father as soon as I returned, but I have 
nothing further to write, and you can show him this. I will immediately let him know what answer I get to the letter I shall send to 
the South by this mail, respecting our dear brother. 

I enclose fifteen dollars, and wish you to let me know that you receive it. Destroy my note, and accept my thanks. If you afford 
my colt plenty of good pasture, hay, and salt, it is all I wish, unless 
he should fall away badly or be sick. Your s bore his journey well. 
Please tell Milton Lusk that I wish to have him pay over the money 
I left with him to Julian, without delay. 

Affectionately yours,

P. S. I want to be informed of any news respecting Salmon as 
soon as any of you get any.

HONORED FATHER, In order to avoid that circumlocution of "compliments," which I have heard you mention as one of the defects of my letters in general, it shall be the object of this to make known to you, with the least preamble and in the fewest possible 
number of words, all that a parent, kind and solicitous as you have ever been, might desire to know in relation to the welfare of an absent child. My health, thank God, has been uniformly good since I was at Hudson last July. From <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, if I mistake not, some 
time in the month of September, I wrote you a letter, and inclosed one of my printed circulars, by which I presumed you would be made 
acquainted with the tour I had in contemplation, and the several points to which letters might be directed in season to reach me. 
This probably was not received till after your return from New England, which circumstance sufficiently accounts for its not being 
answered. I have pursued almost literally the track indicated by the circular alluded to, and still intend to persevere, till I have accomplished the entire journey. My operations have been as successful as heretofore, though I have experienced more delays than usual. On 
leaving this place, I shall proceed South, by the way of Tuscaloosa and Mobile, to New Orleans ; but having business to transact at a 
great many intermediate places, I cannot determine with any degree of certainty when I shall reach there, or how early I shall be able to 
leave that place in the spring. 

This, I am resolved, shall be my last tour in the United States, at 
least on the extensive scale I have practised for the last three years. 
I however still intend to execute the project which I disclosed to 
you last summer j and I cannot neglect the present opportunity to 
thank you for the very valuable hint which you suggested to me, in 
respect of availing myself of the facilities which my travels afford, to 
collect materials and information to be made use of hereafter in pub 
lic lecturing. I have reflected much on the subject, and I am fully 
persuaded the business may be turned to a good practical account, 
in reference to my intended operations abroad. I am therefore ap 
plying myself to the subject in good earnest, both by extending my 
own personal observations as widely as possible, and by consulting 
any written authority which may throw light upon my object of 
research. But pray let this matter, as well as the other ; rest for the 
present between ourselves exclusively. 

I am exceedingly anxious to receive a letter from you. When 
shall I be gratified ? On my arrival at New Orleans ? I hope so. 
I also hope that you will not be sparing of the local news of your 
vicinity. I should like to know something of the results of your journey to the East. You doubtless heard of me among our family 
relations. I am obliged to leave off abruptly, and 1 will not delay 
sending this for the sake of filling out the sheet at another time. My 
love to all our family, and to my friends in general. Adieu.

HONORED FATHER, Having ascended the river to this place, and being under the necessity of returning again to Natchez in order 
to close some unfinished business, I write to advise you of my in tended movements. By the ordinary course of steamboat navigation 
I shall reach there (Natchez) in the course of five or six days, and my stay in that region will be as short as possible. It is my intention afterwards to proceed by the interior of Alabama to Florida, and thence through Georgia and the Carolinas to the North. I cannot at 
this time name with certainty any place where letters directed to my address would be received, though Tallahassee in Florida would seem 
to be the most eligible point ; at all events, I hope you will write to me there. I left New Orleans without receiving any letters from you, 
which was a great disappointment. I however made arrangements 
by which I shall still get them, if any come on to that post-office. I 
have enjoyed good health and thus far a reasonable shave of prosperity in the prosecution of my business, though delays have been 
more frequent than I anticipated, and of longer duration, which will 
be the means of detaining me all summer in the Southern country. 
I beg you will not permit yourself to be uneasy on account of my 
health. I shall avoid the low country on the sea-coast, and by con 
fining myself to the high ground of the interior, I apprehend very 
little danger. Finally, go where I may, I am in the hands of the 
same kind Providence that has heretofore guided me safely through 
an infinity of perils. I have been preserved, no doubt, for some wise 
purpose. I hope it may be to accomplish some great good in the 
world ; if not, why should I desire to live ? 

I am still occupied, heart and soul, with the scheme I have intimated to you before. It is the theme of my constant meditations, 
night and day ; and I am devoting all tny leisure moments for its accomplishment. That the design is a good and laudable one, I have 
no doubt. This gives me confidence to expect great success. 1 

I cannot write more at this moment, but if I am prospered, you 
shall hear from me frequently. Adieu. 

Your affectionate son,

HONORED FATHER, I avail myself of the first moment of leisure 
on my arrival at this place to relieve you from the anxiety which I 
am conscious you have ere this begun to feel on my account. I could 
not have neglected writing so long had I anticipated the possibility of 
being detained so long at the South. One cause of delay after an 
other prolonged the period of my departure from New Orleans till the 
latter part of July, and having to stop at several places on the river 
where I had business to look after, and the rivers being almost too 
low for steamboat navigation at this season, August has almost passed 
away before I could reach here. My health, thank God, has been 
uniformly good, and I am quite well at this time. 

I am without news from any of my family or friends these several 
months past, which makes me exceedingly anxious about their welfare. I hope some of you will write instantly on receiving this, and direct to Wheeling, Virginia, where I expect to be in the course of 
three or four weeks. It is impossible for me to determine whether I 
can visit Hudson this fall or not. I am engaged about some political 
arrangements in opposition to the present unprincipled and corrupt 
Administration, to which I have become so committed as not to be 
master of my own time. The arrangements alluded to have for their 
object the best interests of our common country j and believing that I 
may be instrumental in doing good in this way, I feel it to be my duty 
to exert my endeavors. I go from this place to Frankfort, thence to 
Lexington, 1 thence to Maysville, and thence to Wheeling. If it shall 
be possible for me to visit Hudson before I proceed to the eastward, I will do so. 

An infirmity of my nerves, proceeding from an unknown cause, makes it difficult to write legibly. I have been conscious that this 
was growing on me for years, without being able to apply any remedy. I never lived so temperately as I have the year past. 
Pray present me to the recollection of my brothers and sisters, and to all my Mends affectionately. Years do but increase and confirm the 
sense of filial duty and gratitude with which I remain 

Your son,

DEAR BROTHER, As I have had only one letter from Hudson since you left here, and that some weeks since, I begin to get uneasy 
and apprehensive that all is not well. I had satisfied my mind about it for some time, in expectation of seeing father here, but I begin to 
give that up for the present. Since you left me I have been trying to devise some means whereby I might do something in a practical 
way for my poor fellow-men who are in bondage, and having fully consulted the feelings of my wife and my three boys, we have agreed 
to get at least one negro boy or youth, and bring him up as we do our own, viz., give him a good English education, learn him what we 
can about the history of the world, about business, about general subjects, and, above all, try to teach him the fear of God. We think 
of three ways to obtain one : First, to try to get some Christian slave holder to release one to us. Second, to got a free one if no one will 
let us have one that is a slave. Third, if that does not succeed, we have all agreed to submit to considerable privation in order to buy 
one. This we are now using means in order to effect, in the confident expectation that God is about to bring them all out of the house of bondage. 

I will just mention that when this subject was first introduced, 
Jason had gone to bed j but no sooner did he hear the thing hinted, 
than his warm heart kindled, and he turned out to have a part in the 
discussion of a subject of such exceeding interest. I have for years 
been trying to devise some way to get a school a-going here for 
blacks, and I think that on many accounts it would be a most favor 
able location. Children here would have no intercourse with vicious 
people of their own kind, nor with openly vicious persons of any 
kind. There would be no powerful opposition influence against 
such a thing ; and should there be any, I believe the settlement might 
be so effected in future as to have almost the whole influence of the 
place in favor of such a school. Write me how you would like to 
join me, and try to get on from Hudson and thereabouts some first- 
rate abolitionist families with you. I do honestly believe that our 
united exertions alone might soon, with the good hand of our God 
upon us, effect it all. 

This has been with me a favorite theme of reflection for years. I 
think that a place which might be in some measure settled with a 
view to such an object would be much more favorable to such an 
undertaking than would any such place as Hudson, with all its conflicting interests and feelings ; and I do think such advantages ought 
to be afforded the young blacks, whether they are all to be immediately set free or not. Perhaps we might, under God, in that way 
do more towards breaking their yoke effectually than in any other. 
If the young blacks of our country could once become enlightened, it 
would most assuredly operate on slavery like firing powder confined 
in rock, and all slaveholders know it well. Witness their heaven- 
daring laws against teaching blacks. If once the Christians in the 
free States would set to work in earnest in teaching the blacks, the 
people of the slaveholding States would find themselves constitutionally driven to set about the work of emancipation immediately. 
The laws of this State are now such that the inhabitants of any 
township may raise by a tax in aid of the State school-fund any 
amount of money they may choose by a vote, for the purpose of 
common schools, which any child may have access to by application. 
If you will join me in this undertaking, I will make with you any 
arrangement of our temporal concerns that shall be fair. Our health 
is good, and our prospects about business rather brightening. 

Affectionately yours,

DEAR SON JOHN, Your letter of the 21st instant was received 
yesterday, and as I may be somewhat more lengthy than usual I begin 
my answer at once. The family have enjoyed as good health as 
usual since I wrote before, but my own health has been poor since in May. Father has had a short turn of fever and ague; Jason and 
Ellen have had a good deal of it, and were not very stout on Sunday 
last. The wheat crop has been rather light in this quarter; first 
crop of grass light ; oats very poor ; corn and potatoes promise well, 
and frequent rains have given the late grass a fine start. There has 
been some very fatal sickness about, but the season so far has been 
middling healthy. Our sheep and cattle have done well; have raised 
five hundred and fifty lambs, and expect about eighty cents per pound 
for our wool. We shall be glad to have a visit from you about the 
time of our county fair, but I do not yet know at what time it comes. 
Got a letter from Henry dated the 16th of August ; all there well. 
Grain crops there very good. We are preparing (in our minds, at 
least) to go back next spring. Mrs. Perkins was confined yesterday 
with another boy, it being her eleventh child. The understanding 
between the two families continues much as formerly, so far as I 
know. ., . 

In Talmadge there has been for some time an unusual seriousness 
and attention to future interests. In your letter you appear rather 
disposed to sermonize ; and how will it operate on you and Wealthy 
if I should pattern after you a little, and also quote some from the 
Bible ? In choosing my texts, and in quoting from the Bible, I per 
haps select the very portions which u another portion" of my family 
hold are not to be wholly received as true. I forgot to say that my 
younger sons (as is common in this " progressive age ") appear to 
be a little in advance of my older, and have thrown off the old 
shackles entirely; after THOROUGH AND CANDID investigation they 
have discovered the Bible to be ALL a fiction ! Shall I add, that 
a letter received from you some time since gave me little else than 
pain and sorrow? " The righteous shall hold on his way; " " By 
and by he is offended." 

My object at this time is to recall your particular attention to the 
fact that the earliest, as well as all other, writers of the Bible seem 
to have been impressed with such ideas of the character of the religion 
they taught, as led them to apprehend a want of steadfastness among 
those who might profess to adhere to it (no matter what may have 
been the motives of the different writers). Accordingly we find the 
writer of the first five books putting into the mouth of his Moses expressions like the following, and they all appear to dwell much on 
the idea of two distinct classes among their reputed disciples; namely, 
a genuine and a spurious class : 

" Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or 
tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord our God, to 
serve the gods of these nations ; lest there should be among you a 
root that beareth gall and wormwood." " Then men shall say, because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord God of their 
fathers." " But if thine heart turn away so that thou wilt not hear, 
but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them." 
" Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it to the children of Israel ; put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness 
for me against the children of Israel." " For I know that after my 
death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way 
which I have commanded you." " They have corrupted themselves, 
their spot is not the spot of his children." " Of the Rock that begat 
thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee." 
"-Oh, that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would 
consider their latter end ! " 

The writer here makes his Moses to dwell on this point with a 
most remarkable solicitude, a most heart- moving earnestness. The 
writer of the next book makes his Joshua to plead with Israel with 
the same earnestness. a Choose you this day whom you will serve." 
" Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the 
Lord, to serve him." The writer of the book called Judges uses 
strong language in regard to the same disposition in Israel to back 
slide : " And it came to pass when the judge was dead, that they 
returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers; they 
ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way." 
The writer of the book Ruth makes Naomi say to Orpah, " Thy 
sister-in-law is gone back unto her people and unto jaer gods." The 
writer of the books called Samuel represents Saul as one of the same 
spurious class. Samuel is made to say to him, " Behold, to obey is 
better than sacrifice; and to hearken, than the fat of rams," clearly 
intimating that all service that did not flow from an obedient spirit 
and an honest heart would be of no avail. He makes his Saul turn 
out faithless and treacherous in the end, and finally consult a woman 
" having a familiar spirit," near the close of his sad career. The 
same writer introduces Ahitophel as one whose counsel " was as if 
a man had inquired at the oracle of God; " a writer of the Psalms 
makes David say of him, " We took sweet counsel together, and 
walked to the house of God in company ; " but he is left advising the 
son of David to incest publicly, and soon after hangs himself. The 
spot of those men seems not to be genuine. 

One distinguishing mark of unsoundness with all the Old Testament writers was aversion to the character of the God whom Moses 
declares in his books, and by whose direction all the so-called prophets affirmed that they spoke and wrote. The writer of the books 
called Kings says of Solomon: u And the Lord was angry with 
Solomon, because his heart was turned away from the Lord God of 
Israel; which had appeared to him twice." The same writer makes Elijah inquire of Israel : " How long halt ye between two opinions? 
If the Lord be God, follow him ; but if Baal, then follow him." He 
makes Elijah pray thus: " Hear me, O Lord! hear me, that this 
people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou hast 
turned their heart back again." The same writer makes God say 
to Elijah, " Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the 
knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath 
not kissed him." The same writer makes John say, " Come with 
me and see my zeal for the Lord; * but says of him afterward, " But 
John took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel with 
H!! his heart." This writer also says of Josiah, " And like unto him 
there was no king before him, that turned to the Lord with all his 
heart and with all his soul and with all his might, according to all 
the law of Moses ; neither after him arose there any like him." The 
writer of the book called Chronicles says of Judah, in a time of most 
remarkable reformation: "And they sware unto the Lord with a 
loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets ; 
And all Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their 
heart, and sought him with their whole desire, and he was found of 
them, and the Lord gave them rest round about." Those who wrote 
the books called Ezra and Neherniah notice the same distinguishing 
marks of character. 

The writer of the book called Job, makes God to say of him : 
" There is none like him in the earth; a perfect and an upright man, 
one who feareth God and escheweth evil, and still he holdeth fast his 
integrity." The same writer makes Eliphaz put to Job these questions, remarkable, but searching: " Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways ? " This writer 
makes his different characters call the unstable and unsound, hypocrites. Bildad says, " So are the paths of all that forget God, and 
the hypocrite s hope shall perish. Whose hope shall be cut off, and 
whose trust shall be a spider s web. Zbphar says of the same class 
of persons, tl And their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost." 
Eliphaz says, "Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity, for 
vanity shall be his recompense." Job says, "I know that my Re 
deemer liveth, whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes behold, 
and not another." Zophar says, u The triumphing of the wicked is 
short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment." Job is made 
to inquire concerning those who deceive themselves (as though the 
thing had come to be well understood in his day) : " Will he de 
light himself in the Almighty ? Will he always call upon God ? " 
One writer of the Psalms says of those who did not love Israel s God, 
" Through the pride of his countenance he will not seek after God. 
God is not in all his thoughts." 

A writer of the Psalms, in view of the* different feelings of men 
toward the God of the Bible, has this language : " With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful, with an upright man thou wilt 
show thyself upright, with the pure, thou wilt show thyself pure, and 
with the froward thou wilt show thyself froward." Again in the 
Psalms we read, " The meek shall eat and be satisfied, they shall 
praise the Lord that seek him." Again, " The meek will he guide 
in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way. 7 " All the paths 
of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and 
testimonies." lt The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, 
and he will show them his covenant." " Oh, how great is thy goodness which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee, which thou hast 
wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men ! " " The 
angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and 
delivereth them." u The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants, 
and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate." ll Though 
he fall, yet he shall not be utterly cast down, for the Lord upholdeth 
him with his hand." " The law of his God is in his heart j none of 
his steps shall slide." " But the salvation of the righteous is of the 
Lord j he is their strength in the time of trouble." u Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace," 
The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing ; thou 
wilt make all his bed in his sickness." u Our heart is not turned 
back, neither have our steps declined from thy way." " They go 
from strength to strength ; every one of them in Zion appear before 
God." " Great peace have they that love thy law, and nothing shall 
offend them." "Then shall I not be ashamed when I have respect 
unto all thy commandments." " If I forget thee, Jerusalem ! let 
my right hand forget her cunning." " The backslider in heart shall 
be filled with his own ways." u To the law and to the testimony ! if 
they speak not according to their word, it is because there is no light 
in them." "Thus saith the Lord, What iniquity have your fathers 
found in me that they are gone far from me, and have walked after 
vanity, and have become vain ? " " Turn, back-sliding children, 
saith the Lord." u But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, 
but walked in the counsels and in the imaginations of their evil 
heart, and went backward and not forward." " Yea, the stork in 
the heaven knoweth her appointed times, and the turtle and the crane 
and the swallow observe the time of their coming, but my people 
know not the judgment of the Lord. " " The heart is deceitful above 
all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?" " Thy 
prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee, and they have 
not discovered thine iniquity." " They that observe lying vanities 
forsake their own mercy." il Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God." " Forty years 
long was I grieved with this generation, and said it is a people that 
do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways." " But 
they like men have transgressed the covenant ; there have they dealt 
treacherously against me." " Many shall be purified and made white 
and tried, but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked 
shall understand, but the wise shall understand." " The preacher 
sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written was 
upright, even words of truth." "That the generation to come might 
know them, even the children which should be born, who should 
arise and declare them to their children ; that they might set their 
hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments ; and might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation ; a generation that set not their heart aright, and 
whose spirit was not steadfast with God." " Who is wise and shall 
understand these things ; prudent, and he shall know them ? For the 
ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them; but the 
transgressor shall fall therein." 

" Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I also 
confess before my Father which is in Heaven." " And many ftilse 
prophets shall arise, and shall deceive many ; and because iniquity 
shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold." " And blessed is he 
whosoever shall not be offended in me." " They on the rock are 
they which when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these 
have no root, and for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall 
away." " From that time many of his disciples went back, and 
walked no more with him." u He that rejecteth me, and receiveth 
not my words, hath one that judgeth him : the word that I have 
spoken, the same shall judge him at the last day." " Every branch 
in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away." " But if our gospel 
be hid, it is hid to them that are lost." " I marvel that ye are so 
soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, 
unto another gospel." u Ye did run well: who did hinder you that 
ye should not obey the truth ? " " Beware lest any man spoil you 
through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after 
the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ." " For now we 
live, if ye stand fast in the Lord." " For the time will come when 
they will not endure sound doctrine." " Therefore we ought to give 
the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any 
time we should let them slip." " Let ns therefore fear lest a promise 
being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come 
short of it." "And we desire that every one of you do show the 
same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end ; that ye be 
not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises." ll Now the just shall live by faith j but if any 
man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him." u And this 
I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge 
and in all judgment, that ye may approve things that are excellent, 
that may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ. - "And 
make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned 
out of the way, but let it rather be healed." Looking diligently 
lest any man fail of the grace of God." " For it had been better for 
them not to have known the way of righteousness, than after they 
have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto 
them." " Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou 
hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art

DEAR CHILDREN, It is now nearly a month since I began on another page. Since writing before, father has seemed quite well, 
but Jason, Ellen, Owen, and Frederick have all had more or less of the ague. They were as well as usual, for them, yesterday. Others 
of the family are in usual health. I did mean that my letter should go off at once, but I have not become very stout, and have a great 
deal to look after, and have had many interruptions. We have done part of our sowing, and expect to get all our corn (of which we have 
a good crop) secure from frost this day. We shall be glad to see you here at the time of our county fair, which is to be on the twelfth and thirteenth of October. 

I hope that through the infinite grace and mercy of God you may 
be brought to see the error of your ways, and be in earnest to turn 
many to righteousness, instead of leading astray ; and then you might 
prove a great blessing to Essex County, or to any place where your 
lot may fall. I do not feel u estranged from my children," but I 
cannot flatter them, nor "cry peace when there is no peace." My 
wife and Oliver expect to set out for Pennsylvania before long, and 
will probably call on you j but probably not until after the fair. We 
have a nice lot of chickens fattening for you, when you come. 
Your affectionate father,

The bankruptcy of John Brown, to which he alludes in 
several of his letters, and in connection with which he was 
once imprisoned in the county jail at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a>, occurred in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1842">1842</a>, and the imprisonment was in consequence of this 
affair of the Hudson farm. Among his creditors then was 
the New England Woollen Company at Kockville in Con 
necticut, to whose agent he gave the following agreement, 
with the letter annexed : 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richfield" rel="city">Richfield</a>, Oct. 17, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1842">1842</a>. 

Whereas I, John Brown, on or about the 15th day of June, A. D. 
3839, received of the New England Company (through their agent, 
George Kellogg, Esq.), the sum of twenty- eight hundred dollars for the purchase of wool for said company, and imprudently pledged the 
same for my own benefit, and could not redeem it ; and whereas I 
have been legally discharged from my obligations by the laws of the 
United States, I hereby agree (in consideration of the great kindness and tenderness of said Company toward me in my calamity, 
and more particularly of the moral obligation I am under to render 
to all their due), to pay the same and the interest thereon, from 
time to time, as Divine Providence shall enable me to do. Witness my hand and seal.

GEORGE KELLOGG, ESQ. 

DEAR SIR, I have just received information of my final discharge 
as a bankrupt in the District Court, and I ought to be grateful that 
no one of my creditors has made any opposition to such discharge 
being given. I shall now, if my life is continued, have an opportunity of proving the sincerity of my past professions, when legally 
free to act as I choose. I am sorry to say that in consequence of the 
unforeseen expense of getting the discharge, the loss of an ox, and 
the destitute condition in which a new surrender of my effects has 
placed me, with my numerous family, I fear this year must pass 
without my effecting in the way of payment what I have encouraged 
you to expect (notwithstanding I have been generally prosperous in 
my business for the season). 

Respectfully your unworthy friend ;

Letters of John Brown to his Children. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richfield" rel="city">Richfield</a>, OHIO, July 24, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1843">1843</a>. 

DEAR SON JOHN, I well know how to appreciate the feelings of a young person among strangers, and at a distance from home j and 
no want of good feeling towards you, or interest in you, has been the reason why I have not written yon before. I have been careful 
and troubled with so much serving, that I have in a great measure neglected the one thing needful, and pretty much stopped all correspondence with heaven. My worldly business has borne heavily, and still does j but we progress some, have our sheep sheared, and have 
done something at our haying. Have our tanning business going on 
in about the same proportion, that is, we are pretty fairly behind 
in business, and feel that I must nearly or quite give up one or other 
of the branches, for want of regular troops on whom to depend. We 
should like to know how you expect to dispose of your time hereafter, 
and how you get along, what your studies are, and what difficulties 
you meet. I would send you some money, but I have not yet received a dollar from any source since you left. I should not be so dry 
of funds could I but overtake my work ; but all is well, all is well. 
Will you come home or not this fall ? I suppose there are some per 
sons in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richfield" rel="city">Richfield</a> who would be middling fond of seeing you back once 
more, wherever you may be. I hope you may behave yourself wisely in all things. 

From your affectionate father,

DEAR SON JOHN, Your letter, dated December 21, was received some days ago, bat I have purposely delayed till now, in 
order to comply with your request that I should write about every 
thing. We are all in health ; amongst the number is a new sister, 1 
about three weeks old. I know of no one of our friends that is not in 
comfortable health. I have just met with father ; he was with us a 
few days since, and all were then well in Hudson. Our flock is well, 
and we seem to be overtaking our business in the tannery. Divine 
Providence seems to smile on our works at tliis time ; I hope we 
shall not prove unthankful for any favor, nor forget the giveix (I 
have gone to sleep a great many times while writing the above.) 
The boys and Ruth are trying to improve some this winter, and are 
effecting a little I think. I have lately entered into a copartnership 
with Simon Perkins, Jr., of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a>, with a view to carry on the 
sheep business extensively. He is to furnish all the feed and shelter 
for wintering, as a set-off against our taking all the care of the flock. 
All other expenses we are to share equally, and to divide the profits 
equally. This arrangement will reduce our cash rents at least $250 
yearly, and save our hiring help in haying. We expect to keep the 
Captain Oviatt farm for pasturing, but my family will go into a very 
good house belonging to Mr. Perkins, say from a half a mile to a 
mile out of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a>. I think this is the most comfortable and the most 
favorable arrangement of my worldly concerns that I ever had, and 
calculated to afford us more leisure for improvement, by day and by 
night, than any other- I do hope that God has enabled us to make it in mercy to us, and not th at he should send leanness into our souls. 
Our time will all be at our own command, except the care of the flock. We have nothing to do with providing for them in the winter 
excepting harvesting rutabagas and potatoes. 

This, I think, will be considered no mean alliance for our family, and I most earnestly hope they will have wisdom given to make the 
most of it. It is certainly indorsing the poor bankrupt and his family, 
three of whom were but recently in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> jail, in a manner quite unexpected, and proves that notwithstanding we have been a company 
of u Belted Knights," our industrious and steady endeavors to maintain our integrity and our character have not been wholly overlooked. 
Mr. Perkins is perfectly advised of our poverty, and the times that have passed over us. Perhaps you may think best to have some 
connection with this business. I do not know of ANY person in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richfield" rel="city">Richfield</a> that you would be likely to be fond of hearing from in 
particular, excepting one at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> ; and if hearing from ANY person prove to be a very up-stream business, I would advise not 
to worry at present. Will you let me know how it stands between you and all parties concerned ? 

Your father,

MY DEAR MARY, It is once more Sabbath evening, and nothing so much accords with my feelings as to spend a portion of it in con 
versing with the partner of my choice, and the sharer of my poverty, trials, discredit, and sore afflictions, as well as of what comfort and 
seeming prosperity has fallen to my lot for quite a number of years. I would you should realize that, notwithstanding I am absent in 
body, I am very much of the time present in spirit. I do not forget the firm attachment of her who has remained my fast and faithful 
affectionate friend, when others said of me, u Now that he lieth, he- shall rise up no more." ... I now feel encouraged to believe that 
my absence will not be very long. After being so much away, it seems as if I knew pretty well how to appreciate the quiet of home. 
There is a peculiar music in the word which a half-year s absence in a distant country would enable you to understand. Millions there 
are who have no such thing to lay claim to. I feel considerable regret by turns that I have lived so many years, and have in reality done so 
little to increase the amount of human happiness. I often regret that my manner is no more kind and affectionate to those I really love 
and esteem ; but I trust my friends will overlook my harsh, rough 
ways, when I cease to be in their way as an occasion of pain and unhappiness. In imagination I often see you in your room with Little 
Chick and that strange Anna. You must say to her that father means to come before long and kiss somebody. I will close by 
saying that it is iny growing resolution to endeavor to promote my own happiness by doing what I can to render those about me more 
so. If the large boys do wrong, call them alone into your room, and expostulate with them kindly, and see if you cannot reach them by a 
kind but powerful appeal to their honor. I do not claim that such a theory accords very well with my practice ; I frankly confess it does 
not j but I want your face to shine, even if my own should be dark and cloudy. You can let the family read this letter, and perhaps you 
may not feel it a great burden to answer it, and let me hear all about how you get along. 

Affectionately yours,

DEAR SON JOHN, I received your letter some days ago, but was 
so busy in preparing for my journey to Lowell (on which I now am) 
that I could find no time to write before. We had been waiting for 
news from you for some time, not knowing where you were, and were 
all glad of your letter. I will give a little account of things since 
you left. We moved to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> about the 10th of April ; get along 
very pleasantly with our neighbors Perkins ; find them very affable 
and kind. Have had a good deal of loss amongst our sheep from 
grub in the head. Have raised 560 lambs, and have 2,700 pounds 
of wool ; have been offered 56 cents per pound for one ton of it. 
Jason spends most of his time in Kichfield. Have not yet done 
finishing leather, but shall probably get through in .a few weeks 
after my return. The general aspect of our worldly affairs is favor 
able. Hope we do not entirely forget God. I am extremely ignorant 
at present of miscellaneous subjects. Have not been at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richfield" rel="city">Richfield</a> for 
some time, and have but a moment to write, on board a boat. I 
enclose three dollars, and would more, but may be short of expense

DEAR SON JOHN, I arrived at home December 2d j had a fatiguing but I should think a prosperous journey, and brought with 
me a few choice sheep. Our wool sold by the sort, at from 24 cents to $1.20 per pound, just as we wash it on the sheep; average, about 
the same as last year, perhaps a little better. Our flock have done remarkably this winter, and are in good condition and health. We 
have lost but three by disease since sometime in the fall. Our sales of sheep (mostly bucks) since August amount to about $ 640. Since 
my return, I have been troubled considerably with my eyes. They are better now. Your letter to Ruth is received, and she is preparing to 
go with you when you come out. I have a plan to lay before you for your operations after the first of June next, and hope you will not commit yourself for a longer time until you hear it. I think we have quite as much worldly prosperity as will be likely to be a real blessing to 
us. Fred is in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richfield" rel="city">Richfield</a> for the present, with about 250 sheep and a dog under his command. He seems disposed to reading and some 
thought. Would like to have you write him there, or here perhaps would be better. Write often.

DEAR SON, I am out among the wool-growers, with a view to the next summer s operations. Left home about a week ago; all were 
then in middling health except some very hard colds. I expect to be out some three or four weeks yet, and on that account do not know as 
I shall be able to hear from you and Ruth until I get home. Hope to hear from you then. Mr. Perkins came home a day or two after you 
left, full in the faith of our plan, having completed our arrangements. Our plan seems to meet with general favor. Jason and I have talked 
of a visit to Canada on our return next fall. We would like to know more about that country. We should be glad to hear something from 
George Delamater, and to know where he is, and what he really means to be. You may, if you think best, say so to him, and tell him we 
have not forgotten him. Our unexampled success in minor affairs might be a lesson to us of what unity and perseverance might do in 
things of some importance. If you learn of any considerable wool-dealers or wool-growers, you can use the circular, and more may be 
sent if best ; of that you can judge after a little inquiry. I may write you again before I go home. Say to Ruth, to be all that to-day 
which she intends to be to-morrow.

So it seems he was a vintager as well as a shepherd; 
indeed, he sought perfection in all his undertakings, and 
was constantly improving the stock of cattle, the quality of 
orchards, grape-vines, etc., as his sons do still. In March, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1839">1839</a>, he drove a herd of cattle from Ohio to Connecticut, 
and in July brought back with him a few fine sheep, from 
which he bred his first flock in Eichfield. He had made a 
previous journey to Connecticut the same year, in connec 
tion with his financial embarrassment, and in the course of 
it wrote the following letter to his wife :

... I have felt distressed to get my business done and return, 
ever since I left home, but know of no way consistent with duty but 
to make thorough work of it while there is any hope. Things now 
look more favorable than they have, but I may still be disappointed. 

We must all try to trust in Him who is very gracious and full of 
compassion and of almighty power ; for those that do will not be made 
ashamed. Ezra the prophet prayed and afflicted himself before God, 
when himself and the Captivity were in a straight, and I have no 
doubt you will join with me under similar circumstances. Don t get 
discouraged, any of you, but hope in God, and try all to serve him

DEAR SON JOHN, I reached Liverpool on Sabbath day ; the 26th iust., and this place the 27th at evening, a debtor to Grace for 
health and for a very pleasant and quick passage. Have called on the Messrs. Pickersgill, and find they have neither sold any wool nor 
offered any. They think that no time has been lost, and that a good sale can yet be expected. It is now the calculation to offer some 
of it at the monthly sale, September next, commencing a little before the middle of the month. I have had no time to examine any wools 
as yet, and can therefore express no opinion of my own in the matter. England is a fine country, so far as I have seen ; but nothing so very 
wonderful has yet appeared to me. Their forming and stone-masonry are very good ; cattle, generally more than middling good. 1 Horses, 
as seen at Liverpool and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, and through the fine country betwixt these places, will bear no comparison with those of our 
Northern States, as they average. I am here told that I must go to the Park to see the fine horses of England, and I suppose I must ; 
for the streets of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> and Liverpool do not exhibit half the display of fine horses as do those of our cities. But what I judge 
from more than anything is the numerous breeding mares and colts among the growers. Their hogs are generally good, and mutton-sheep are almost everywhere as fat as pork. Tell my friend Middleton and wife that England affords me plenty of roast beef and mutton of the first water, and done up in a style not to be exceeded. As I intend to write you very often I shall not be lengthy j shall 
probably add more to this sheet before I seal it. Since writing the above, I find that it will be my best way to set out at once for the 
Continent, and I expect to leave for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> this evening. So farewell for this time,* now about four o clock p. M.

DEAR SON JOHN, I have nothing new to write excepting that I am still well, and that on Monday a lot of No. 2 wool was sold 
at the auction sale, at from twenty-six to twenty-nine cents per pound. This is a bad sale, and I have withdrawn all other wools from the 
market, or public sales. Since the other wools have been withdrawn, I have discovered a much greater interest among the buyers, and I 
am in hopes to succeed better with the other wools ; but cannot say yet how it will prove on the whole. I have a great deal of stupid, 
obstinate prejudice to contend with, as well as conflicting interests, both in this country and from the United States. I can only say that 
I have exerted myself to the utmost, and that if I cannot effect a better sale of the other wools privately I shall start them back. I 
believe that not a pound of No. 2 wool was bought for the United States j and I learn that the general feeling is now that it was 
quite undersold. About one hundred and fifty bales were sold. I regret that so many bales were put up ; but it cannot be helped now, 
for after wool has been subjected to a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> examination for public sale, it is very much injured for selling again. The agent of Thirion, 
Mallard, & Co., has been looking at them to-day, and seemed highly pleased ; said he had never seen superior wools, and that he would 
see me again. We have not yet talked about price. 

I now think I shall begin to think of home quite in earnest at 
least in another fortnight, possibly sooner. I do not think the sale 
made a full test of the operation. .Farewell.

DEAR SON JOHN AND WIFE, When at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, on my way here, I called at Messrs. Fowler & Wells s office, but you were 
absent. Mr. Perkins has made me a visit here, and left for home yesterday. All well at Essex when I left; all well at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> when 
he left, one week since. Our meeting together was one of the most cordial and pleasant I ever experienced. He met a full history of 
our difficulties and probable losses without a frown on his countenance, or one syllable of reflection ; but, on the contrary, with words 
of comfort and encouragement. He is wholly averse to any separation of our business or interest, and gave me the fullest assurance of 
his undiminished confidence and personal regard. He expresses strong desire to have our flock of sheep remain undivided, to become 
the joint possession of our families when we have gone off the stage. Such a meeting I had not dared to expect, and I most heartily wish 
each of my family could have shared in the comfort of it. Mr. Perkins has in the whole business, from first to last, set an example 
worthy of a philosopher, or of a Christian. I am meeting with a good deal of trouble from those to whom we have over-advanced, but 
feel nerved to face any difficulty while God continues me such a partner. Expect to be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> within three or four weeks.

only to say at this moment, do suspend all further plans and movements until you can hear the result of a general consultation over 
matters with Mr. Perkins, your grandfather, and Jason. I will just

DEAR SON JOHN, I was disappointed in not seeing you and Wealthy l while in Ohio ; and not till within a few days did I get to 
know where to write you, as I have been on the move most of the season. I should have written you while at Ravenna, but expected 
every day to see you. We have trouble : Pickersgills, McDonald, Jones, Warren, Burlington, and Patterson & Ewing, these different claims amount to some forty thousand dollars, and if lost will leave me nice and flat. This is in confidence. Mr. Perkins bears the 
trouble a great deal better than I had feared. I have been trying to collect, and am still trying. Have not yet effected a sale of our wool. 
I expect to take some of the best of my cattle to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a>. Our crops in Essex were very good this season, and expenses small.

you to write me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a> all how you get along, and what you are doing and intend to do, and what your prospects are. I have in 
no way altered my plan of future operations since conversing with you, and I found Mr. Perkins s views fully correspond with my own. 
I have my head and hands quite full ; so no more now. 

Your affectionate father,

DEAR SONS JOHN, JASON, FREDERICK, AND DAUGHTERS, I this moment received the letter of John and Jason of the 29th November, and feel grateful not only to learn that you are all alive and well, but also for almost everything your letters communicate. I am 
much pleased with the reflection that you are all three once more together, and all engaged in the same calling that the old patriarchs 
followed. I will say but one word more on that score, and that is taken from their history : " See that ye fall not out by the way," and 
all will be exactly right in the end. I should think matters were 
brightening a little in this direction, in regard to our claims ; but I 
have not yet been able to get any of them to a final issue. I think, 
too, that the prospect for the fine-wool business rather improves. 
What burdens me most of all is the apprehension that Mr. Perkins 
expects of me in the way of bringing matters to a close what no 
living man can possibly bring about in a short time, and that he is 
getting out of patience and becoming distrustful. If I could be with 
him in all I do, or could possibly attend to all my cares, and give him 
full explanations by letter of all my movements, I should be greatly 
relieved. He is a most noble -spirited man, to whom I feel most 
deeply indebted ; and no amount of money would atone to my feelings for the loss of confidence and cordiality on his part. If my sons, 
who are so near him, conduct wisely and faithfully and kindly in 
what they have undertaken, they will, beyond the possibility of a 
doubt, secure to themselves a full reward, if they should not be the 
means of entirely relieving a father of his burdens. 

I will once more repeat an idea I have often mentioned in regard 
to business life in general. A world of pleasure and of success is the 
sure and constant attendant upon early rising. It makes all the business of the day go off with a peculiar cheerfulness, while the effects of 
the contrary course are a great and constant draft upon one s vitality 
and good temper. When last at home in Essex, I spent every day 
but the first afternoon surveying or in tracing out old lost boundaries, 
about which I was very successful, working early and late, at two dol 
lars per day. This was of the utmost service to both body and mind } 
it exercised me to the full extent, and for the time being almost entirely divested my mind from its burdens, so that I returned to my 
task very greatly refreshed and invigorated. 

John asks me about Essex. I will say that the family there were 
living upon the bread, milk, butter, pork, chickens, potatoes, turnips, 
carrots, etc., of their own raising, and the most of them abundant in 
quantity and superior in quality. I have nowhere seen such potatoes. Essex County so abounds in hay, grain, potatoes, and rutabagas, etc., that I find unexpected difficulty in selling for cash oats 
and some other things we have to spare. Last year it was exactly 
the reverse. The weather was charming up to the 15th November, 
when I left, and never before did the country seem to hold out so many tilings to entice me to stay on its soil. Nothing but a strong sense of 
duty, obligation, and propriety would keep me from laying my bones 
to rest there ; but I shall cheerfully endeavor to make that sense my 
guide, God always helping. It is a source of the utmost comfort to 
feel that I retain a ;rann place in the sympathies, affections, and 
confidence of my own most familiar acquaintance, my family ; and 
allow me to say that a man can hardly get into difficulties too big to 
be surmounted, if he has a firm foothold at home. Eemember that. 

I am glad Jason has made the sales he mentions, on many accounts. 
It will relieve his immediate money wants, a thing that made me 
somewhat unhappy, as I could not at once supply them. It will 
lessen his care and the need of being gone from home, perhaps to the 
injury somewhat of the flock that lies at the foundation, and possibly 
to the injury of Mr. Perkins s feelings on that account, in some 
measure. He will certainly have less to divide his attention. I had 
felt some worried about it, and I most heartily rejoice to hear it ; for 
you may all rest assured that the old flock has been, and so long as 
we have anything to do with it will continue to be, the main root, 
either directly or indirectly. In a few short months it will afford 
another crop of wool. 

I am sorry for John s trouble in his throat ; I hope he will soon 
get relieved of that. I have some doubt about the cold-water practice in cases of that kind, but do not suppose a resort to medicines of 
much account. Regular out-of-door labor I believe to be one of the 
best medicines of all that God has yet provided. As to Essex, I have 
no question at all. For stock-growing and dairy business, consider 
ing its healthfulness, cheapness of price, and nearness to the two best 
markets in the Union (<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>), I do not know where 
we could go to do better. I am much refreshed by your letters, and 
until you hear from me to the contrary, shall be glad to have you 
write me here often. Last night I was up till after midnight writing 
to Mr. Perkins, and perhaps used some expressions in my rather 
cloudy state of mind that I had better not have used. I mentioned 
to him that Jason understood that he disliked his management of the 
flock somewhat, and was worried about that an&lt;X the poor hay he 
would have to feed out during the winter. I did not mean to write 
him anything offensive, and hope he will so understand me. 

There is now a fine plank road completed from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=westport" rel="city">Westport</a> to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=elizabethtown" rel="city">Elizabethtown</a>.. We have no hired person about the family in Essex. 
Henry Thompson is clearing up a piece of ground that the lt colored brethren " chopped for me. He boards with the family ; and, by the 
way, he gets Ruth out of bed so as to have breakfast before light, mornings. 

I want to have you save or secure the first real prompt, fine-looking, black shepherd puppy whose ears stand erect, that you can get ; 
I do not care about his training at all, further than to have him learn to come to you when bid, to sit down and lie down when 
told, or something in the way of play. Messrs. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> & Titus, our lawyers in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, are anxious to get one for a plaything ; 
and I am well satisfied, that, should I give them one as a matter of friendship, it would be more appreciated by them, and do more to 
secure their best services in our suit with Pickersgill, than would a 
hundred dollars paid them in the way of fees. I want Jason to obtain from Mr. Perkins, or anywhere he can get them, two good junk- 
bottles, have them thoroughly cleaned, and filled with the cherry wine, being very careful not to roil it up before filling the bottles, 
providing good corks and filling them perfectly full. These I want him to pack safely in a very small strong box, which he can make, 
direct them to Perkins & Brown, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a>, Mass., and send them 
by express. We can effect something to purpose by producing unadulterated domestic wines. They will command great prices. 1 It 
is again getting late at night ; and I close by wishing every present as well as future good. 

Your affectionate father,

DEAR SON JOHN, Your kind letter is received. By same mail 
I also have one from Mr. Perkins in answer to one of mine, in which 
I did in no very indistinct way introduce some queries, not altogether 
unlike those your letter contained. Indeed, your letter throughout is 
so much like what has often passed through iny own mind, that were 
I not a little sceptical yet, I should conclude you had access to some 
of the knocking spirits. 2 I shall not write you very long, as I mean to write again before many days. Mr. Perkins s letter, to which I 
just alluded, appears to be written in a very kind spirit ; arid so long 
as he is right-side up, I shall by no means despond ; indeed, I think 
the fog clearing away from our matters a little. I certainly wish to 
understand, and I mean to understand, u how the land lies" before 
taking any important steps. You can assist me very much about 
being posted up ; but you will be able to get hold of the right end 
exactly by having everything done up first-rate, and by becoming 
very familiar, and not by keeping distant. I most earnestly hope 
that should I lose caste, my family will at least prove themselves 
worthy of respect and confidence ; and I am sure that my three sons 
in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> can do a great job for themselves and for the family if 
they behave themselves wisely. Your letter so well expresses my 
own feelings, that were it^ not for one expression I would mail it 
with one I have just finished, to Mr. Perkins. Can you not all 
three eifectually secure the name of good business men this winter? 
That you are considered honest and rather intelligent I have no 
doubt. 

I do not believe the losses of our firm will in the end prove so very 
severe, if Mr. Perkins can only be kept resolute and patient in regard 
to matters. I have often made mistakes by being too hasty, and 
mean hereafter to u ponder well the path of my feet." I mean to 
pursue in all things such a course as is in reality wise, and as will in 
the end give to myself and family the least possible cause for regret. 
I believe Mr. Newton is properly authorized to take testimony. If 
so, I wish you to ascertain the fact and write me ; if not, I want you 
to learn through Mr. Perkins who would be a suitable person for that 
business, as I expect before many weeks to want your testimony, 
and I want you to give me the name. I forgot to write to Mr. Perkins about it, and have sealed up my letter to him. I mentioned 
about your testimony, but forgot what I should have written. 
Your affectionate father,

DEAR SON JOHN, I wrote you some days since, enclosing ten 
dollars, and requesting you to acknowledge it, and also to hold your 
self in readiness to go to Pittsburgh when called upon ; since which 
I have not heard from you. I am now on my way to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> ; and 
as our causes at Pittsburgh have been continued until next fall, we 
shall not need you there until then. We have now no prospect of 
any trial until fall, except with Henry Warren ; and we wish you to 
so arrange your business that you can leave for Troy upon a short 
notice. I also want you to keep me advised at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> of your whereabouts, so that I may call upon you should I have time. I did expect to go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hartford" rel="city">Hartford</a> when I left home, but find I must alter my 
course. I was in Essex on Tuesday last. Left Ruth and husband well, and very comfortably situated. We seem to get along as pleasantly as I expected, so far ; can t say how long it will be so ; hope we may continue. I want you to write often and let us know how 
you get along. Had sad work among our Saxony ewes and lambs 
by dogs, Saturday night last : probably forty killed and wounded.

from home or from Essex since we parted. Met Mr. Jenkins at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>, and we came on together to Utica. He was pleased with the

DEAR SON JOHN, Yours, dated November 14, came on in season, but an increased amount of cares has prevented me from answering 
sooner. One serious difficulty has been with Frederick, who has been very wild again. He is again, however, to all appearance 
nearly recovered from it by the return to an abstemious course of 
living, almost, if not quite, the only means used. He had gradually slid back into his old habit of indulgence in eating, the effect of 
which I consider as being now fully demonstrated. I now expect to set out for Troy on Wednesday of this week, at furthest ; and if you 
do not see me at Vernon before the stage leaves on Thursday, I wish you to take it on that day, so as to meet me-at Bonnet s Temperance 
House in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=buffalo" rel="city">Buffalo</a>. The going is too bad to go by private conveyance, and I am yet at a loss how I can get through from Warren 
to Vernon with my trunk of books, etc. I intend to bring my watch with me. I have accomplished a good deal in the way of 
preparation for winter, but shall be obliged to leave a great deal undone. If you do not find me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=buffalo" rel="city">Buffalo</a> (or before you get there), 
you may wait there not longer than till Saturday evening, and then take the cars for Troy. You will learn at Bennet s whether I am 
behind or not. If you have not funds sufficient to take you to Troy, you can probably borrow a little, to be refunded immediately when I see you, by Perkins & Brown. 

Yours, J. B.

SIMON PERKINS, ESQ. 

DEAR SIR, I called on Messrs. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> & Titus to-day. Found 
Mr. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> intended to charge us three hundred dollars as a balance of accounts. I asked him for the principal items of his charge, 
which he promised to make up, and leave, directed to you, care of 
Messrs. Delano, Dunlevy, & Co., 39 Wall Street. He said he could 
not make it up without keeping me detained over night. As I could 
see no advantage to be derived from waiting, after hearing his expla 
nation of the matter, I concluded not to wait. He says he drew an 
amended bill after drawing the first complaint, and that he gave 
more time to that than he did to the complaint. Since I left him I 
have thought this was not quite right, after the conversation we had 
with him together, and after our letter to them dated May 16, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1851">1851</a>. 
He said to me that if I was not satisfied with the charge it should be 
reduced. I did not tell him what I thought ; but if I had thought 
of our letter at the time I should have asked him to refer to it, as 
I think he went contrary to his own advice, and also to our last 
instructions. If you call on him, I wish you would ask him to read that letter to you. I think it can do no harm, and that he will probably abate something from his charge. I should not now, after reflecting upon it, hesitate to say that I think he ought to do it (and 
since looking up the copy of our letter to them). In haste, 

Your friend, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">JOHN BROWN</a>.

P. S. If you call on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> &. Titus, and can find room, I would be glad to have you bring the papers in that case. I forgot to ask for them. 

Yours truly, J. B.

DEAR SON JOHN, I have this moment got a line from Mr. Ely, 
saying our trial at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> will not come on until the first week in 
January next. I give you this early notice, in hopes that it will relieve your mind in a measure, and that it will be more convenient for

to go home again before that time or not. Will write you hereafter

DEAR SON JOHN. I reached home last night, and found all well. 
I came by the Erie Railroad, and got along very well until I left 
Dunkirk. Fare from Dunkirk to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a>, $8.90 ; expenses from 
same to same, $4.02, and was two and a half entire days getting 
through, the roads being vastly worse than when we went out. Had 
I expected so hard and so expensive a trip, I should not have re 
turned. I mean to go back by Pittsburgh and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, there 
being on that route but twenty-eight miles of sleighing, from Troy to 
Hudson, and that on a good road. I intend to get back to Troy by 
the 17th if I can. Have not yet seen Mr. Perkins, to have any conversation with him of any account. Whatever you may do in the 
preparation of papers will be all well for the Burlington case. You 
will have saved a great amount of exposure, hardship, and expense by

DEAR SON JOHN, I have written Mr. Perkins to send you money 
for expenses, so that you may set out for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> by the 21st January 
at furthest. I am too much used up about money to remit, or I should 
do so. I have written Mr. Perkins to come on himself by way of 
Vernon; but if he does not get on, or send you money in time, do 
not on any account delay setting out, if you have to borrow the 
money for a few days. The money will be sent, and if it does not 
reach you in time, Wealthy l can use it to pay, should you not have 
it on hand. Mr. Beebe has got home from Europe, which we think 
very fortunate. Mr. Harrington is here with me from Troy ; he has 
got his case against Warren affirmed during the last week. I hope 
this may prove a sickness to Warren about standing out against us. 

I am so much in haste, and have my mind so full, that I can think 
of no more now, except that I stop at the Exchange Coffee House in

DEAR SON JOHN, I learn by brother Jeremiah, who has just 
returned, that you have engaged yourself to buy wool. I have no 
objection to your doing so ; but an untiring anxiety for your welfare 
naturally inclines me to remind you of some of the temptations to 
which you may be exposed, as well as some of the difficulties you 
may meet with. Wool-buyers generally accuse each other of being 
unscrupulous liars; and in that one thing perhaps they are not so. 
Again, there are but very few persons who need money, that can 
wholly resist the temptation of feeling too rich, while handling any considerable amount of other people s money. They are also liable to 
devote God s blessed Sabbath to conversation or contrivances for furthering their schemes, if not to the examination and purchase of wool. 
Now, I would not have you barter away your conscience or good nam6 
for a commission. You will find that many will pile away their wool, 
putting the best outside, and will be entirely unwilling you should 
handle it all. I would at once leave such lots, unless that point is 
yielded. I would have an absolute limit of prices on the different 
grades. You can throw into different grades, pretty fast, a lot of wool, 
so as to see pretty nearly whether it will average above or below the 
grade you wish generally to buy. Do not let your anxiety to buy carry 
you one inch beyond your judgment. Do not be influenced a particle 
by what you hear others have offered. Never make, an absolute offer 
to any one for Ms wool. If persons will not set a price on it, which you 
feel confident you are authorized to pay, you can ask them if they will 
not take so much, without really making any bid. If you make bids, 
some other buyer will follow you, and get the wool by offering a 
trifle more. A very trifling difference will very often do as much 
towards satisfying persons as would a greater one. You will generally buy to the best advantage where the wool is generally good and 
washed: you can buy to better advantage by finding a good stand, 
and there buying no more than you have the funds on hand to pay 
for. Do not agree to pay money you have not on hand. Remember 
that. Say who you are employed to buy for frankly if asked. The 
less you have to say about the why or wherefore the better, other 
than that you are limited. A book containing the grading of numerous lots of wool is with me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a>, to which you can have access ; 
it may be of service to you about knowing how different lots will 
average. Buy you a superior cow, one that you have milked your 
self, and know to give a good quantity of milk, before getting a 
horse. The getting of a horse will get for you numerous absolute 
wants you would otherwise not have. All well. Shall want to know 
where to find you.

NORTH ELBA, N. Y., Dec. 15, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1852">1852</a>. 

DEAR SON JOHN, I got here last night, and found all very comfortable and well, except Henry, who is troubled with a lame back, 
something like rheumatism I presume. The weather has been very 
mild so far, and things appear to be progressing among our old 
neighbors ; so that I feel as much as ever disposed to regard this as 
my home, and I can think of no objection to your coming here to live 
when you can sell out well. A middling good saw- mill is now running a few rods down the river 1 from the large pine log we used to 
cross on, when we went to help Henry take care of his oats. The 
more I reflect on all the consequences likely to follow, the more I am 
disposed to encourage you to come here j and I take into the account 
as well as I can the present and future welfare of yourself and 
family, and prospects of usefulness. Our trial at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> is to come 
on by agreement on the 6th January. I shall write Mr. Perkins to 
send you money for expenses, so that you can get, on to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> by 
the 3d January. We shall want to look the papers over, and talk

DEAR WIFE, ... Since leaving home I have thought that under 
all the circumstances of doubt attending the time of our removal, and 
the possibility that we may not remove at all, I had perhaps encouraged the boys to feed out the potatoes too freely. ... I want 
to have them very careful to have no hay or straw wasted, but I 
would have them use enough straw for bedding the cattle to keep 
them from lying in the mire. I heard from Ohio a few days since ; 
all were then well. It now seems that the Fugitive Slave Law was 
to be the means of making more Abolitionists than all the lectures we have had for years. It really looks as if God had his hand on 
this wickedness also. I of course keep encouraging my colored 
friends to u trust in God, and keep their powder dry." I did so 
to-day, at Thanksgiving meeting, publicly. . . . While here, and at 
almost all places where 1 stoy, I am treated with all kindness and 
attention ; hut it does not make home. I feel lonely and restless, no 
matter how neat and comfortable my room and bed, nor how richly 
loaded may be the table ; they have few charms for me, away from

to buy a little sugar, to write Mr. Cutting, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=westport" rel="city">Westport</a>, to send out 
some. I conclude you have got your belt before this. I could not 
manage to send the slates for the boys, as I intended, so they must 
be provided for some other way. . . . Say to the little girls that I 
will run home the first chance I get ; but I want to have them learn

I have drawn an order on you, payable in board of Mail-carrier, 
horse-feed, or oats, in favor of Mr. Judd for $7.09, which you will 
oblige me by paying in oats at forty cents per bushel, or in board as 
above, whichever he may choose. When you can sell my stuff please 
pay your father $2.00 for me. I also wish you to send on of my shingles that Hiram Brown carried out, two thousand to Alva Holt, as 
we settled about the oats on condition of my sending him two thou 
sand. I wish you to open an account of debt and credit with me from 
this time on, as I shall have a good many errands to trouble you 
with. I wish you would notify Mr. Flanders by letter at once (if Nash calls on you for the $3.00) to go ahead with the suit. Mr. 
Kellogg told me he thought the Trustees would settle with me, were 
he to write to them. We are getting along very well ; the boys are 
still ahead, and Jack is with us. Mr. Blood talked of taking the 
shingles before I sold the two thousand to Holt, and said he would 
go and look at them, and give me $1.50 per thousand for them if he 
liked them. I wish to do the handsome thing by him about it. 
Would be glad to have you see him about it. My love unceasing 
to Ruth.

DEAR CHILDREN, As I am still detained at this place, I improve 
a leisure moment to write you, as the only means of communicating 
with a part of my family in whose present and future interests I have 
an inexpressible concern. Words and actions are but feeble means 
of conveying an idea of what I always feel whenever my absent children come into mind j so I will not enlarge on that head. . . . 

I wish you to say to Mr. Epps l that if Mr. Hall does not soon 
take care of the boards that are fallen down about the house he 
built, I wish he and Mr. Dickson would go and take them away, 
as I paid for them, and am the rightful owner of them. I wish to 
have them confine themselves entirely to those of the roof and gable- 
ends. I mean to let Hall have them if he will occupy the building, 
or have any one do it on his account ; but I do not mean to have him 
let them lie year after year and rot, and do no one any good. I wish 
this to be attended to before the snow covers them up again.

DEAR HENRY, Mr. Judd is wanting to buy a large quantity of

wants to buy a supply for his teams that carry the mail to Saranac,

... I seem to be pretty much over the effects of the ague, except 
as to my sight, which is some impaired, and which will not probably 
ever become much better. I made a short visit to North Elba, and 
left them all well and very comfortable, one week ago to-day. ... 
The colored families appear to be doing well, and to feel encouraged. 

They all send much love to you. They have constant preaching on 
the Sabbath ; and intelligence, morality, and religion appear to be 
all on the advance. Our old neighbors appear to wish us back. I 
can give no particular instructions to the boys, except to take the 
best care of everything, not forgetting their own present and eternal good. If any young calves come that are nice ones, I want them 
to be well looked after, and if any very mean ones, I would have them 
killed at once. I am much pleased to get such a good account from, 
the boys, and from Anne and Sarah.

I have thought a good deal how to arrange as well as possible in 
regard to a home, should I live to go back to North Elba. I am a 
good deal at a loss how to divide the land so as to accommodate both 
families in the best way ; and I wish to call your attention to that 
matter, as you may perhaps be able to think of some way that will 
exactly suit all hands. I would be glad if Henry will send me his 
views freely in regard to the following questions, namely : Are you 
fond of the business or care of a sawmill f Are there any springs on 
that part of the lot lying east of the river, so situated as to accommo 
date a family on that side ; or do you think there is a prospect of 
getting a good well where the strip is of some width, and the face 
such as would be convenient to build on ? Would you divide the 
land by the river, or by a line running east and west ? Will it be 
any damage to you if you defer building your house until we can hit 
on some plan of dividing the land, or at least for another year? If I 
was sure of going back next spring I should want to get some logs 
peeled for a house, as I expect to be quite satisfied with a log-house 
for the rest of my days. Perhaps by looking over the land a little 
with a view to these things, you can devise a plan that will suit well. 
I do not mean to be hard to please j but such is the situation of the 
lot, and so limited are my means, that I am quite at a loss. Will it 
be convenient to have the ground that is gone over on the east side 
of the river got into grass this season ? . . . I can think of but little 
to write that will be worth reading. Wishing you all present and 
future good, I remain, 

Your affectionate father,

DEAR CHILDREN, Your very welcome letters were received last night. In regard to a house, I did not prefer a log one, only in view 
of the expense ; and I would wish Henry to act according to his own 
best judgment in regard to it. If he builds a better house than I can 
pay for, we must so divide the land as to have him keep it. I would 
like to have a house to go into next spring, if it can be brought about 
comfortably. I ought to have expressed it more distinctly in better 
season, but forgot to do so. We are in comfortable health, so far as 
I know, except father, Jason, and Ellen, all of whom have had a run 
of ague. Father, when I saw him last, was very feeble ; and I fear 
that in consequence of his great age he will never get strong again. 
It is some days since I went to see him. We are not through sheep- 
shearing or hoeing, and our grass is needing to be cut now. We have 
lately had very dry weather. ... I am much rejoiced at the news 
of a religious kind in Ruth s letter ; and would be still more rejoiced 
to learn that all the sects who bear the Christian name would have 
no more to do with that mother of all abominations, man-stealing. 
I hope, unfit and unworthy as I am, to be allowed a membership in 
your little church before long ; and I pray God to claim it as his own, 
and that he will most abundantly bless all in your place who love him 
in truth. u If any man love not his brother whom he hath seen, how 
can he love God whom he hath not seen ? " I feel but little force 
about me for writing or any kind of business, but will try to write 
you more before long. Our State fair commences at Dayton the 20th 
of September, and will be held open four days.

DEAR CHILDREN, I did not get Ruth s letter, dated on the 1st

to learn that you found things as well as you did. In fact, God 
never leaves us without the mst abundant cause for gratitude ; and 
let us try and have it in habitual exercise. We have had some com 
plaints among several of us of late, but none of us have been very 
unwell. We had a most comfortable settlement of last year s business with Mr. Perkins, and division of stock. I had nine of the 
company calves, and he sold me four of the old for one hundred dollars, which I used to have. I have two young bull calves, one a 
full blood, which I think among the best I ever saw.

so that I do not now know as I shall be able to go and see you at

MY DEAR FRIEND, Your most welcome letter of the 14th hist., 
from Au Sable Forks, is received. I cannot express the gratitude I 
feel to all the kind friends who contributed towards paying for the 
place at North Elba, after I had bought it, as I am thereby relieved 
from a very great embarrassment both with Mr. Smith and the young 
Thompsons, and also comforted with the feeling that my noble-hearted 
wife and daughters will not be driven either to beg or become a bur 
den to my poor boys, who have nothing but their hands to begin with. 
I am under special obligation to you for going to look after them and 
cheer them in their homely condition. May God reward you all a 
thousandfold! No language I have can express the satisfaction it 
affords me to feel that I have friends who will take the trouble to look 
after them and know the real condition of my family, while I am " far 
away," perhaps never to return. I am still waiting here for company, 
additional teams, and means of paying expenses, or to know that I can 
make a diversion in favor of our friends, in case they are involved 
again in trouble. Colonel Forbes has come on and has a small 
school at Tabor. I wrote you some days ago, giving a few particulars in regard to our movements; and I intend writing my friend 
Stearns, as soon as I have anything to tell him that is worth a stamp. Please say to him, that, provided I do not get into such a 
speculation as shall swallow up all the property I have been furnished with, I intend to keep it all safe, so that he may be remunerated in 
the end ; but that I am wholly in the dark about it as yet, and that I caunot flatter him much now. Will direct where to write me when 
I know how to do so. 

Very respectfully your friend,

This was not the only undertaking of the sort in which 
John Brown lent his aid and advice to the fugitive slaves 
and their free brethren of color at the North. For years 
he labored quietly among them, seeking to bring them to 
a better knowledge of their position, and to form habits 
that would fit them for freedom ; and in this period he 
wrote some curious papers. Among these are the following 
chapters of an unfinished pamphlet called "Sambo s Mis 
takes," which he began to publish in an obscure Abolitionist 
journal called "The Bamshorn," with a distant allusion, 
I suppose, to the downfall of Jericho at the blowing of the 
Hebrew horns. The manuscript of these chapters is now in 
the library of the Maryland Historical Society at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, 
in the handwriting of John Brown, and reads thus : 



SAMBO S MISTAKES. 
I. 

MESSRS. EDITORS, Notwithstanding I may have committed a 
few mistakes in the course of a long life, like others of my colored 
brethren, yet you will perceive at a glance that I have always been 
remarkable for a seasonable discovery of my errors and quick perception of the true course. I propose to give you a few illustrations in 
this and the following chapters. 

For instance, when I was a boy I learned to read ; but instead of 
giving my attention to sacred and profane history, by which I might 
have become acquainted with the true character of God and of man; 
learned the true course for individuals, societies, and nations to pur 
sue ; stored my mind with an endless variety of rational and practical ideas ; profited by the experience of millions of others of all 
ages ; fitted myself for the most important stations in life, and fortified my mind with the best and wisest resolutions, and noblest 
sentiments and motives, I have spent my whole life devouring 
silly novels and other miserable trash, such as most newspapers of 
the day and other popular writings are filled with ; thereby unfitting 
myself for the realities of life, and acquiring a taste for nonsense and 
low wit, so that I have no relish for sober truth, useful knowledge, 
or practical wisdom. By this means I have passed through life 
without profit to myself or others, a mere blank on which noth 
ing worth perusing is written. But I can see in a twiuk where I missed it. 

Another error into which I fell in early life was the notion that 
chewing and smoking tohacco would make a man of me, but little 
inferior to some of the whites. The money I spent in this way 
would, with the interest of it, have enabled me to have relieved a 
great many sufferers, supplied me with a well-selected, interesting 
library, and paid for a good farm for the support and comfort of my 
old age j whereas I have now neither books, clothing, the satisfaction of having benefited others, nor where to lay my hoary head. 
But I can see in a moment where I missed it. 

Another of the few errors of my life is, that I have joined the 
Free Masons, Odd Fellows, Sons of Temperance, and a score of 
other secret societies, instead of seeking the company of intelligent, 
wise, and good men, from whom I might have learned much that 
would be interesting, instructive, and useful ; and have in that way 
squandered a great amount of most precious time, and money enough, 
sometimes in a single year, which if I had then put the same out on 
interest and kept it so, would have kept me always above board, 
given me character and influence among men, or have enabled me 
to pursue some respectable calling, so that I might employ others 
to their benefit and improvement j but, as it is, I have always been 
poor, in debt, and now obliged to travel about in search of employment 
as a hostler, shoe-black, and fiddler. But I retain all my quickness 
of perception ; I can see readily where I missed it. 

Another error of my riper years has been, that when any meeting 
of colored people has been called in order to consider of any important matter of general interest, I have been so eager to display my 
spouting talents, and so tenacious of some trifling theory or other 
that I have adopted, that I have generally lost all sight of the business in hand, consumed the time disputing about things of no moment, and thereby defeated entirely many important measures calculated to promote the general welfare ; but I am happy to say I can 
see in a minute where I missed it. 

Another small error of my life (for I never committed great blunders) has been that I never would (for the sake of union in the 
furtherance of the most vital interests of our race) yield any minor 
point of difference. In this way I have always had to act with but 
a few, or more frequently alone, and could accomplish nothing worth 
living for ; but I have one comfort, I can see in a minute where I 
missed it. 

Another little fault which I have committed is, that if in anything 
another man has failed of coming up to my standard, notwithstanding 
that he might possess many of the most valuable traits, and be most 
admirably adapted to fill some one important post, I would reject him 
entirely, injure his influence, oppose his measures, and even glory 
in his defeats, while his intentions were good, and his plans well 
laid. But I have the great satisfaction of being able to say, without 
fear of contradiction, that I can see very quick where I missed it. 

Another small mistake which I have made is, that I could never 
bring myself to practise any present self-denial, although my theories 
have been excellent. For instance, I have bought expensive gay 
clothing, nice canes, watches, safety- chains, finger-rings, breastpins, 
and many other things of a like nature, thinking I might by that 
means distinguish myself from the vulgar, as some of the better class 
of whites do. I have always been of the foremost in getting up 
expensive parties, and running after fashionable amusements ; have 
indulged my appetite freely whenever I had the means (and even 
with borrowed means) ; have patronized the dealers in nuts, candy, 
etc., freely, and have sometimes bought good suppers, and was 
always a regular customer at livery stables. By these, and many 
other means, I have been unable to benefit my suffering brethren, 
and am now but poorly able to keep my own soul and body together; 
but do not think me thoughtless or dull of apprehension, for I can 
see at once where I missed it. 

Another trifling error of my life has been, that I have always expected to secure the favor of the whites by tamely submitting to every 
species of indignity, contempt, and wrong, instead of nobly resisting 
their brutal aggressions from principle, and taking my place as a 
man, and assuming the responsibilities of a man, a citizen, a husband, 
a father, a brother, a neighbor, a friend, as God requires of every 
one (if his neighbor will allow him to do it) ; but I find that I get, 
for all my submission, about the same reward that the Southern slaveocrats render to the dough-faced statesmen of the North, for 
being bribed and browbeat and fooled and cheated, as the Whigs and 
Democrats love to be, and think themselves highly honored if they 
may be allowed to lick up the spittle of a Southerner. I say I get 
the same reward. But I am uncommon quick-sighted; I can see in 
a minute where I missed it 

Another little blunder which I made is, that while I have always 
been a most zealous Abolitionist, I have been constantly at war with 
my friends about certain religious tenets. I was first a Presbyterian, 
but I could never think of acting with my Quaker friends, for they 
were the rankest heretics ; and the Baptists would be in the water, 
and the Methodists denied the doctrine of Election, etc. Of later 
years, since becoming enlightened by Garrison, Abby Kelly, and 
other really benevolent persons, I have been spending all my force 
on my friends who love the Sabbath, and have felt that all was at 
stake on that point; just as it has proved to be of late in France, in 
the abolition of slavery in their colonies. Now I cannot doubt, 
Messrs. Editors, notwithstanding I have been unsuccessful, that you 
will allow me full credit for my peculiar quick-sighteduess. I can see 
in one second where I missed it. 

This paper, dating before <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1850">1850</a>, illustrates the points 
of resemblance between Franklin and John Brown, for 
"Poor Bichard" himself might have written these keen 
and kindly sayings. Brown disliked the effort of writing, 
which led him to shorten almost everything he wrote ; so 
that " Sambo s Mistakes " was one of his longest essays, 
and perhaps the most satirical. He took little part in the 
public debates on slavery, and when in the last year of his 
life (<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1859">1859</a>), he was present for a day or two at the Antislavery meetings in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, he came out saying, " Talk ! talk ! 
talk ! that will never set the slave free." His form of 
activity was something that would operate, as he said in 
his letter of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1834">1834</a>, "like powder confined in rock;" and 
such was the effect of his own movements in Kansas and 
in Virginia. 

His daughter, Mrs. Thompson, thus speaks of his concern 
for the fugitive slaves in the anxious season of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1850">1850</a>-51, 
when the slaveholders, encouraged by the success of the 
Clay and Webster Compromises, sought to insult and worry 
the people of the North by reclaiming all runaway slaves 
wherever they might be : 

" Father did not close up his wool business in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a> when he 
went to North Elba, and had to make several journeys back and forth 
m <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1849">1849</a>-50. He was at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a> in January, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1851">1851</a>, soon after the 
passage of the Fugitive Slave Law, and went round among his colored 
friends there who had been fugitives, urging them to resist the law, 
no matter by -what authority it should be enforced. He told them to 
arm themselves with revolvers, men and women, and not to be taken 
alive. When he got to North Elba he told us about the Fugitive 
Slave Law, and bade us resist any attempt that might be made to 
take any fugitive from our town, regardless of fine or imprisonment. 

Our faithful boy Cyrus was one of that class j and our feelings were 
so roused that we would all have defended him, though the w r omen 
folks had resorted to hot water. Father at this time said, Their 
cup of iniquity is almost full. One evening as I was singing The 
Slave Father Mourning for his Children/ containing these words, 

* Ye re gone from me, my gentle ones, 
"With all your shouts of mirth ; 
A silence is within my walls, 
A darkness round my hearth, 

father got up and walked the floor, and before I could finish the 
song, he said, Ruth ! don t sing any more; it is too sad ! "

DEAR WIFE, ... Since the sending off to slavery of Long 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, I have improved my leisure hours quite busily with 
colored people here, in advising them how to act, and in giving them 
all the encouragement in my power. They very much need encouragement and advice ; and some of them are so alarmed that they tell 
me they cannot sleep on account of either themselves or their wives and children. I can only say I think I have been enabled to do 
something to revive their broken spirits. I want all my family to 
imagine themselves in the same dreadful condition. My only spare 
time being taken up (often till late hours at night) in the way I 
speak of, has prevented me from the gloomy homesick feelings 
which had before so much oppressed me : not that I forget my 
family at all. 

Some of the advice thus given has already been copied : 
more condensed suggestions are as follows : 

" Collect quietly, so as to outnumber the adversaries who are taking 
an active part against you j make clean work with all such, and be 
sure you meddle not with any other. Do not delay one moment after 
you have a fair majority of your own men over those who are actually 
about the mischief. Let the collection of a fair majority be your signal to engage ; and when engaged do not do your business by halves. 
When one of you engage, let all the others fall to work without noise 
or confusion. Stand by one another and by your friends while a drop 
of blood remains, and be hanged if you must, but tell no tales out of 
school ; make no confessions. Hold 011 to your tools, and never be 
scared or persuaded, by the world combined, to part with them, or to 
leave them away from you. Do not trust them with friend or foe. 
Always keep your families advised of the places where you may be 
found when absent from home." 

Four or five years earlier than this, and soon after 
Brown s arrival in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a>, lie had begun to communi 
cate his purpose of attacking slavery by force to the colored 
men whom he found to be worthy of trust. In <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1846">1846</a> there 
was living in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a> (where he still resides) a fugitive 
slave from the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Thomas Thomas 
by name, whom Brown engaged to work for him as a porter 
in his wool warehouse. " How early shall I come to-morrow, 7 
said Thomas the day he was hired. " We begin work at 
seven," said Brown ; " but I wish you would come round 
earlier, so that I can talk with you." Thomas therefore 
went to his employer s the next morning between five and 
six o clock, found Brown waiting for him, and there received from him the outlines of his plan to liberate the 
slaves, and was invited to join in the enterprise, which he 
agreed to do. This was nine years before Brown went to 
Kansas, and two years before Simmer, Wilson, Adams, S. C. 
Phillips, Hoar, and their friends formed the Free Soil party 
of Massachusetts. Thomas was afterward sent by Brown to 
look up Madison Washington, the leader of the courageous 
slaves of the vessel " Creole," who was wanted as a leader 
among the colored recruits that were to join the band of 
liberators ; but Washington, when found, proved to be an 
unfit person for such a task. 

It is said that the first definite thought of the place where 
he should make his attack upon the slave system came to 
Brown while he was surveying lands for Oberlin College, in 
what is now West Virginia, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1840">1840</a>. These lands were, in 
part at least, in the county of Jackson, which borders on 
Ohio, and is separated from that State by the Ohio River. 
It is west of the Alleghanies, and is not very mountainous ; 
but in approaching or leaving it Brown had occasion to ob 
serve how useful those mountains would be to any band of 
men who were aiming at emancipation by force. " The 
mountains and swamps of the South," said Brown in Kansas, 
" were intended by God as a refuge far the slave, and a de 
fence against his master." That he cherished this purpose 
when he wrote the following from West Virginia, nearly 
twenty years before his foray at Harper s Ferry, is certain ; 
and the thought that he had his great project in mind then, 
gives an interest to the brief letter :

KIPLEY, VA., April 27, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1840">1840</a>. 

... I like the country as well as I expected, and its inhabitants 
rather better ; and I have seen the spot where, if it be the will of 
Providence, I hope one day to live with niy family. . . . Were 
the inhabitants as resolute and industrious as the Northern people, 
and did they understand how to manage as well, they would become 
rich j but they are not generally so. They seem to have no idea of 
improvement in their cattle, sheep, or hogs, nor to know the use of 
enclosed pasture-fields for their stock, but spend a large portion 
of their time in hunting for their cattle, sheep, and horses ; and the 
same habit continues from father to son. . . . By comparing them 
with the people of other parts of the country, I can see new and 
abundant proof that knowledge is power. I think we might be very 
useful to them on many accounts, were we so disposed. May God 
in mercy keep us all, and enable us to get wisdom ; and with all our 
getting or losing, to get understanding !

HUDSON, Jan. 18, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1841">1841</a>. 

DEAR SON JOHN, Since I parted with you at Hudson some 
thoughts have passed through my mind which my intense anxiety 
for your welfare prompts me to communicate by writing. I think 
the situation in which you have been placed by Providence at this 
early period of your life will afford to yourself and others some little 
test of the sway you may be expected to exert over minds in after life, 
and I am glad, on the whole, to have you brought in some measure 
to the test in your youth. If you cannot now go into a disorderly 
country school and gain its confidence and esteem, and reduce it to 
good order, and waken up the energies and the very soul of every rational being in it, yes, of every mean, ill-behaved, ill-governed boy 
and girl that compose it, and secure the good- will of the parents, 
then how are you to stimulate asses to attempt a passage of the Alps ? 
If you run with footmen and they should weary you, how should you 
contend with horses ? If in the land of peace they have wearied you, 
then how will you do in the swelling of Jordan ? Shall I answer the 
question myself? "If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, 
who giveth liberally and upbraideth not." Let me say to you again, love them all, and commend them and yourself to the God to whom 
Solomon sought in his youth, and he shall bring it to pass. You 
have heard me tell of dividing a school into two large spelling-classes, 
and of its effects ; if you should think best, and can remember the 
process, you can try it. Let the grand reason, that one course is 
right and another wrong, be kept continually before your own mind 
and before your school. 

From your affectionate father,

DEAR SON JOHN, Yours of the 28th April we did not get very 
seasonably, as we have been very busy, and not at the post-office 
often. We are all obliged for your letter, and I hope thankful for 
any comfort or success that may attend you. If the days of mourn 
ing have indeed and in truth ceased, then I trust all is well, all is 
well as it should be ; and I have known fair days to follow after very 
foul weather. The great trouble is, we are apt to get too damp in a 
wet, foggy spell. We are all well but little Annie, who is afflicted 
with a singular eruption of the skin, and is withal quite unwell. We 
get along in our business as well as we ever have done, I think. We 
have some sheep, but not as many as for two seasons past. Matters 
seem to go well betwixt us and our friend Perkins, and for anything 
that I know of, our worldly prospects are as good as we can bear. 
I hope that entire leanness of soul may not attend any little success 
in business. I do not know as we have yet any new plans ; when we 
have, we will let you hear. We are nearly through another yean 
ing time, and have lost but very few. Have not yet counted tails : 
think there may be about four hundred. Never had a finer or more 
thrifty lot. Expect to begin washing sheep next week. Have received our medals and diploma. They are splendid toys, and appear 
to be knock-down arguments among the sheep-growers who have 
seen them. All were well at Hudson a few days since. Father was 
here, and had just moved into the Humiston house out west. You 
did not say in your letter whether you ever conversed with him in 
regard to his plans for his old age, as was talked of when you were 
here and were helping pick sheep ; should like to know if you did, 
etc. Cannot tell you much more now, except it be that we all appear 
to think a great deal more about this world than about the next, 
which proves that we are still very foolish. I leave room for some 
others of the family to write, if they will. 

Affectionately yours,

afraid the wheat is all killed. There will be here no article of fruit. I trust you will perform your service with patient spirit, doing with

DEAR SON AND DAUGHTER, I wrote you some time since, enclosing five dollars ; but neither of you have let me know whether 
you received it or not, nor how much you were in immediate want of. Two lines would have told me all, and that you were or were not 
well. I now enclose you ten dollars ; and I want to hear from you without one moment s delay, or I cannot till I get to New England 
(possibly). Say to me how much you must have for your bills at Austinburg and expenses back to this place. I can calculate for 
John s expenses to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a> from here, and will provide for that. I have some nice cloth for an entire suit, which I think I had better 
take for you (John) to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a>, so that you can have it made up there if you have any want of clothes before winter. We have plenty 
of it on hand, and it will save paying out the money. We are getting a good pair of calfskin boots made for you. We intend to take on a good supply of nice well-made shirts, in order to save your paying there for such things more than is indispensable, and also to prevent your being delayed after you come back here with Ruth. 

It is barely possible that Jason and I may come by way of Austinburg. We expect to start in a little more than a week from this. 
If I do not come by your place on my way, you may look for another letter before I start for the East. It may be that some of your bills 
can lie unpaid till I can sell some of our wool, and let you draw on Perkins & Brown at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a> for the amount, instead of making 
a remittance by mail. Some of your merchants or other business 
men might be glad to get a small draft of that kind, payable at sight. 
Let me know all about matters. All are well here.

DEAR MARY, ... Your letter dated the 20th was received last 
night, and afforded me a real though a mournful satisfaction. That 
you had received, or were to receive, a letter from either John or 
Jason I was in perfect ignorance of till you informed me ; and I am 
glad to learn that, wholly uninfluenced by me, they have shown a 
disposition to afford you the comfort in your deep affliction which the 
nature of the case would admit of. Nothing is scarcely equal with 
me to the satisfaction of seeing that one portion of my remaining 
family are not disposed to exclude from their sympathies and their 
warm affections another portion. I accept it as one of the most 
grateful returns that can be made to me for any care or exertion on 
my part to promote either their present or their future well-being : 
and while I am able to discover such a feeling, I feel assured that 
notwithstanding God has chastised us often and sore, yet he has not 
entirely withdrawn himself from us nor forsaken us utterly. The 
sudden and dreadful manner in which he has seen fit to call our dear 
little Kitty to take her leave of us is, I need not tell you how much, 
in my mind ; but before Him I will bow my head in submission and 
hold my peace. ... I have sailed over a somewhat stormy sea for 
nearly half a century, and have experienced enough to teach me 
thoroughly that I may most reasonably buckle up and be prepared 
for the tempest. Mary, let us try to maintain a cheerful self-command 
while we are tossing up and down ; and let our motto still be Action, 
Action, as we have but one life to live.

DEAR DAUGHTER RUTH, Yours dated the 20th and Jason s dated 
the 16th of December were both received in season, and were very 
grateful to our feelings, as we are anxious to hear from home often, 
and had become very uneasy before we got word from Jason. We 
are middling well, and very much perplexed with our work, accounts, 
and correspondence. We expect now to go home, if our lives and 
health are spared, next month, and we feel rejoiced that the time is 
so near when we hope to meet you all once more. Sometimes my 
imagination follows those of my family who have passed behind the 
scenes; and I would almost rejoice to be permitted to make them a 
personal visit. I have outlived nearly half of all my numerous family, and I ought to realize that in any event a large proportion of my 
journey is travelled over. 

You say that you would like very much to have a letter from me, 
with as much good advice as I will give. Well, what do you sup 
pose I feel most anxious for in regard to yourself and all at home ? 
Would you believe that I ever had any such care on my mind about 
them as we read that Job had about his family (not that I would 
ever think to compare myself with Job) I Would you believe that 
the long story would be that ye sin not, that you form no foolish 
attachments, and that you be not a companion of fools ?

DEAR SON JOHN, Yours dated Feb. 27th I this day received. 
It was written about the same time I reached this place again. I 
am glad to learn that you are relieved in a good measure from another 
season of suffering. Hope you will make the right improvement of 
it. I have been here nearly two weeks. Have Captain Spencer, 
Freeman, the Hudsons, together with Schlessinger and Ramsden, all 
helping me again. Have turned about four thousand dollars worth 
of wool into cash since I returned j shall probably make it up to 
seven thousand by the 16th. Sold Musgrave the James Wallace lot 
yesterday for fifty-eight cents all round. Hope to get pretty much 
through by the middle of April. Have paid your account for the 
11 Cincinnati Weekly Herald and Philanthropist," together with two 
dollars for one year s subscription to " National Era," being in all 
three dollars. I should have directed to have the "National Era " 
sent you at Austinburg, but could not certainly know as you would 
be there to take it. You had better direct to have it sent to you 
there. I now intend to send Ruth on again soon after my return. 
Jason writes on the 3d that all are well at home. I feel better than 
when I left home, and send my health to all in and about Austinburg.

DEAR SON JOHN, Yours of the 5th is just received. I was very 
glad to learn by it that you were then well. I had begun to feel 
anxious, not hearing for so long a time since you wrote, that you 
were unwell. My own health is middling good ; and I learn that 
all at home were well a few days since. I enclose ten dollars; and 
I must say that when you continue to make INDEFINITE applications for money, without giving me the least idea of the amount you 
need, after I have before complained of the same thing, namely, your not telling me frankly how much you need, it makes me feel 
injured. Suffice it to say that it always affords me the greatest 
pleasure to assist you when I can ; but if you want five, ten, twenty, 
or fifty dollars, why not say so, and then let me help you so far as I 
am able ? It places me in an awkward fix. I am much more will 
ing to send you all you actually need (if in my power), than to send 
any when you do not tell what your wants require. 

I do not now see how we could make the exchange Mr. Walker 
proposes in regard to sheep, but should suppose it might be done to 
his mind somewhere in our direction. I should think your brother 
student might pay the postage of a letter ordering the " Era" to you 
at Austinburg till the year expires. I have ten times as many papers 
as I can read. Have got on middling well, since I wrote you, with 
the wool-trade, and mean to return shortly, and send Ruth to Austin- 
burg. Do not see how to take time to give you further particulars 
now, having so much every hour to attend to. Write me on receipt 
of this. Will send you a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=steubenville" rel="city">Steubenville</a> report. 

Affectionately your father, 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">JOHN BROWN</a>.

DEAR SON JOHN, I wrote you yesterday to urge your coming 
here to keep up the family for a few months, as I knew of no way to 
provide for Jason or Owen s board ; but that matter is all got over, 
and the probability is that Jason will have a wife as soon as you. 
We mean to have the business done up before we leave, so as to 
have no breaking up of the family here. I would now say that if 
you can get ready and meet us at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=buffalo" rel="city">Buffalo</a> on the 14th or 15th, we 
shall be glad to have you go on with us. I would be willing to 
delay for a day or more in order to bring it about. It would seem as 
though you might bring it about by that time, so early as to get here 
on the 16th, as you wrote. As matters now stand, I feel very anx 
ious to have you go on with us, and partly on Frederick s account. 
I sent you yesterday a certificate of deposit for fifty dollars, directed to 
Vernon, care of Miss Wealthy Hotchkiss. 1 Should it so happen that 
you get to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=buffalo" rel="city">Buffalo</a> before we do, wait for us at Bennett s Hotel ; or 
we will wait for you awhile. Inquire for us at Bennett s, or of George 
Palmer, Esq. If you get this in season, you may perhaps get to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=buffalo" rel="city">Buffalo</a> before we can. Mary is still quite feeble. Frederick appears 
to be quite as well as when you left. Say to Ruth I remember her.

DEAR DAUGHTER RUTH, I have not heard from you since John 
left to come on here ; and I can assure you it is not for want of interest in your welfare that I have so long delayed writing you. We 
got over the tedious job of moving as \vell as we could expect, and 
have both families comfortably fixed. Frederick has been under the 
treatment of one of the most celebrated physicians in Massachusetts, 
and for some part of the time has appeared to be as well as ever, but 
has not appeared so well for a few days past. Your mother is quite 
unwell with a bilious fever, and has been so for a day or two. We 
think she is doing well now, and hope she will get around soon. 
We have almost all of us complained more or less since we got on 
here. We have heard from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> every few days since we came on. 
All were well there a short time since. 

Our business here seems to go on middling well, and should nothing befall me I hope to see you about the last of this month or early 
next. John says he will write you soon. I supposed he had done 
BO before this, until now. We are very busy, and suppose we are 
likely to be for the present. We expect you to write us how you get 
along, of course.

DEAR MARY, ... There is an unusual amount of very interesting things happening in this and other countries at present, and no one can foresee what is yet to follow. The great excitement produced by the coining of Kossuth, and the last news of a new revolution 
in France, with the prospect that all Europe will soon again be in a blaze, seems to have taken all by surprise. I have only to say in 
regard to those things, I rejoice in them, from the full belief that God 
is carrying out his eternal purpose in them all. I hope the boys 
will be particularly careful to have no waste of feed of any kind, for 
I am strongly impressed with the idea that a long, severe winter is before us.

DEAR CHILDREN, I returned here on the evening of the 19th 
inst., having left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> on the 14th, the date of your letter to John. 
I was very glad to hear from you again in that way, not having received anything from you while at home. I left all in usual health, 
and as comfortable as could be expected ; but am afflicted with you 
on account of your little boy. Hope to hear by return mail that you 
are all well. As in this trouble you are only tasting of a cup I have 
had to drink deeply, and very often, I need not tell you how fully I 
can sympathize with you in your anxiety. . . . 

How long we shall continue here is beyond our ability to foresee, 
but think it very probable that if you write us by return mail we 
shall get your letter. Something may possibly happen that may 
enable us (or one of us) to go and see you, but do not look for us. I 
should feel it a great privilege if I could. We seem to be getting 
along well with our business so far, but progress miserably slow. 
My journeys back and forth this winter have been very tedious. If 
you find it difficult for you to pay for Douglass paper, I wish you 
would let me know, as I know I took liberty in ordering it continued. You have been very kind in helping me, and I do not mean 
to make myself a burden.

DEAR CHILDREN, I reached home on the 18th at evening, meet 
ing with father on the way, who went home with me and left us 
yesterday; he kept me so busied that I had no time to write you 
yesterday. I found all in usual health but Frederick, who has one 
of his poor turns again ; it is not severe, and we hope will not be so. 
I now enclose the Flanders lease. You will discover that the bar 
gain I had with him for the second year is simply an extension of the time made on the back of it, except that for the last year I was to 
pay the taxes. Owen says he thinks the tooth fell out of the harrow 
while lying on a pile of sticks and old boards near the corner of the 
barn, between that and the house ; and that if you do not find it

DEAR CHILDREN, I have a great deal to write, and but very 
little time in which to do it. A letter was received from you, which 
Salmon put in his pocket before it had been opened, and lost it. This 
grieved me very much indeed j I could hardly be reconciled to it. 
We have been having the measles, and now have the whooping- 
cough among the children very bad. Your mother was confined by 
the birth of the largest and strongest boy she ever had two weeks 
ago, and has got along well considering all our difficulties. The 
little one took the measles, and was very sick, and has now the 
whooping-cough so bad that we expect to lose him ; we thought 
him dying for some time last night. Annie and Sarah cough badly ; 
Oliver is getting over it. Our little one has dark hair and eyes like 
Watson s ; notwithstanding our large number, we are very anxious to 
retain him. 

Jason and Owen have gone on to a large farm of Mr. Perkins over 
in Talmadge. Frederick is with us, and is pretty well. The family 
of Mr. Perkins have the whooping-cough, and have had the measles. 
They have another son, a few days older than ours. Our other 
friends are well, so far as we know. Father was with us, quite well, 
a few days ago. We have had so much rain that we could do but 
little towards spring crops. Have planted our potatoes. The grass 
is forward ; great prospect of apples and cherries, but no peaches 
scarcely. Have twelve of the finest calves I ever saw. Our <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=troy" rel="city">Troy</a> 
suit went in our favor, but not to the extent that it ought. I 
have bought out the interests of Jason and Owen in the lot we 
got of Mr. Smith, on which, I suppose, you are living before this. 
I can send you no more now than my earnest wishes for your 
good, and my request that as soon as you can you send me the 
substance of your last letter, with such additions as you may be able 
to make. 

Your affectionate father,

DEAR SON JOHN, I wrote you a few days before the death of 
our infant son, saying we expected to lose him ; since then we have 
some of us been sick constantly. The measles and whooping-cough 
went so hard with Sarah that we were quite anxious on her account, 
but were much more alarmed on account of my wife, who was taken 
with bleeding at the lungs two or three days after the death of her 
child. She was pretty much confined to her bed for some weeks, and 
suffered a good deal of pain, but is now much more comfortable, and 
able to be around. About the time she got about I was taken with 
fever and ague, and am unable to do much now, but have got the 
shakes stopped for the present. The almost constant wet weather 
put us back very much about our crops, and prevented our getting in 
much corn. What we have is promising. Our wheat is a very good 
quality, but the crop is quite moderate. Our grass is good, and we 
have a good deal secured. We shall probably finish harvesting 
wheat to-day. Potatoes promise well. Sheep arid cattle are doing 
well ; and I would most gladly be able to add that in wisdom and 
good morals we are all improving. The boys have done remarkably 
well about the work ; I wish I could see them manifest an equal 
regard for their future well-being. Blindness has happened to us in 
that which is of most importance. 

We are at a loss for a reason that we do not hear a word from you. 
The friends are well, so far as I know. Heard from Henry and Ruth 
a few days since. 

Your affectionate father, 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">JOHN BROWN</a>.

DEAR SON JOHN, I had just written a short letter to you, directed and sealed it, when I got yours of the 1 st instant. I am glad 
to hear from- you again, and had been writing that I could not re 
member hearing anything from you since early last spring. I air 
pretty much laid up with the ague, and have been for more than a 
month. The family are about in their usual health. Your mother 
is not well, but is about the house at work. The other friends are 
well, so far as I know. After something of a drouth, the weather 
has become very unsteady j yet we have not had a great amount of 
rain. We get a little so often that we progress slowly with our hay 
ing, of which we have yet considerable to do; we have also some 
late oats to cut. Have our wheat secured. Our corn we had to 
plant over once ; it now looks promising. The prospect for potatoes, 
since the rains have begun to come, is good. Our sheep and cattle 
are doing well ; we think of taking some to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> to show. 
Have not heard from Henry and Ruth since June 26, when they were 
well. Mr. Ely of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> writes us that our trial there will corne on 
about the 21st September, and that we must then be ready. He says 
Mr. Beebe had not returned from Europe July 24, but is expected 
this month. We want you without fail to have your business so 
arranged that you can go on and be there by that date, as we cannot 
do without you at all. We have not yet sold our wool. I hope 
your corn and oats will recover ; ours that was blown down last year 
did in a good measure. 

One word in regard to the religious belief of yourself, and the ideas 
of several of my children. My affections are too deep-rooted to be 
alienated from them; but " rny gray hairs must go down in sorrow 
to the grave " unless the true God forgive their denial and rejection 
of him, and open their eyes. I am perfectly conscious that their 
eyes are blinded to the real truth, their minds prejudiced by hearts 
unreconciled to their Maker and Judge j and that they have no right 
appreciation of his true character, nor of their own. il A deceived 
heart hath turned them aside." That God in infinite mercy, for 
Christ s sake, may grant to you and Wealthy, and to my other chil 
dren, u eyes to see," is the most earnest and constant prayer of 
Your affectionate father, 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">JOHN BROWN</a>.

DEAR RUTH, Your letter to mother and children is this day 
received. We are always glad to hear from you, and are much 
pleased with the numerous particulars your letters contain. I have 
had a return of the ague (rather severe), so that I am pretty much 
laid up, and not good for much anyway; am now using means to 
break it up again. Your mother is still more or less troubled with 
her difficulties, but is able to keep about and accomplish a good deal. 
The remainder of the family (and friends, so far as I know) are quite 
well. We are getting nearly through haying and harvest. Our hay 
crop is most abundant ; and we have lately had frequent little rains, 
which for the present relieves us from our fears of a terrible drouth. 
We are much rejoiced to learn that God in mercy has given you some 
precious showers. It is a great mercy to us that we frequently are 
made to understand most thoroughly our absolute dependence on a 
power quite above ourselves. How blessed are al] whos& hearts and 
conduct do not set them at variance with that power ! Why will not 
my family endeavor to secure his favor, and to effect in the one only 
way a perfect reconciliation ? 

The cars have been running regularly from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> 
since July 5, so that there is now steam conveyance from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=westport" rel="city">Westport</a>. This is a great comfort, as it reduces the journey to such 
a trifling affair. We are making a little preparation for the Ohio 
State Fair at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a>, on 15th, 16th, 17th September next, and 
think we shall exhibit some cattle and sheep. Mr. and Mrs. Perkins have been away at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> for about three weeks. Mr. Perkins is away for a great part of the time. We are quite obliged to our friend Mrs. Dickson for remembering us ; are glad she is with 
you, and hope you will do a little towards making her home with you 
happy on our account, as we very much respect her, and feel quite an 
interest in her welfare. 

Our Oliver has been speculating for some mouths past in hogs. I 
think he will probably come out about even, and maybe get the interest of his money. Frederick manages the sheep mostly, and butchers 
mutton for the two families. Watson operates on the farm. Salmon 
is chief captain over the cows, calves, etc., and he has them all to 
shine. Jason and Owen appear to be getting along with their farm 
ing middling well. The prospect now is that the potato crop will be 
full middling good. Annie and Sarah go to school. Annie has be 
come a very correct reader. Sarah goes singing about as easy as an 
old shoe. Edward still continues in California. Father is carrying on 
his little farming on his own hook still, and seems to succeed very 
well. I am much gratified to have him able to do so, and he seems 
to enjoy it quite as much as ever he did. 1 I have now written about 
all I can well think of for this time.

DEAR SON JOHN, I now enclose five dollars to pay you for the expense of your trip to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> as near as I can. I would have 
given you more at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> had I met with Mr. Perkins in season after you concluded to leave. We will hereafter arrange about your 
time so as to make that satisfactory. We drew three second premiums at the fair, but no first premium. Our bull by far the most 
extraordinary animal we have got no premium at all. We heard a very strong expression of dissatisfaction with the award on Devon 
bulls from numerous strangers, as well as from many good judges of our acquaintance, before we left the ground. We received a first 
premium on a yearling buck, and he was the meanest sheep of four teen that we exhibited ; we got no other premium on sheep.

DEAR CHILDREN, We received Ruth s letter of the 31st August 
a few days before our State fair at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a>, which came off on the 
15th, 16th, and 17th instant. John and myself expected to go from 
there to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, and John came on to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> for that purpose ; 
but just then we learned that our trial would not come on until 
November next. I may leave to go on to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> before November, 
but cannot say now. We got four premiums on cattle and sheep at 
the fair, two of ten dollars each, one of fifteen dollars, and one of 
twenty-five dollars. The Perkinses were much pleased with the 
show of stock we had to make, but felt, as many others did, that 
great injustice was done in not giving us but one first premium, and 
that on our poorest buck exhibited. The premiums were paid in 
silver cups, goblets, etc., and are of little use, except for mere show. 
All the friends were well at the time of the fair, and a large portion 
of them on the show-ground, father among the rest. It was sup 
posed to be the greatest exhibition ever had in the Western States, far 
exceeding those of the State of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> ; but a vast majority of 
those who were at much pains and cost to exhibit their stock and 
other things went away disappointed of any premiums. This is a 
mortifying reflection. 

We are busy taking care of our potatoes and apples, and preparing 
to sow our grain. I have had no shake of ague for some time, but 
am not strong. The family are in usual health. Write again.

DEAR WIFE, I have the satisfaction to say that we have at last 
got to trial, and I now hope that a little more than another week will 
terminate it. Up to this time our prospects appear favorable. ... I 
have no word for the boys, except to say I am very glad to hear they 
are doing so well, and that every day increases my anxiety that they 
all will decide to be wise and good j and I close by saying that such 
is by far my most earnest wish for you all.

DEAR CHILDREN, It was my intention, on parting with John at 
Conneaut, to have written you soon; but as Mr. Perkins (immediately on my return home) expressed a strong desire to have me 
continue with him at least for another year, I have deferred it, in 
hopes from day to day of being able to say to you on what terms I 
am to remain. His being absent almost the whole time has pre 
vented our making any definite bargain as yet, although we have 
talked considerably about it. Our bargain will not probably vary 
much from this, namely, he to furnish land, stock of all kinds, teams, 
and tools, pay taxes on lands, half the taxes on other property, and 
furnish half the salt ; I to furnish all the work, board the hands, pay 
half the taxes on personal property put in, half the interest on capital 
on stock, and half the insurance on same, and have half the proceeds 
of all grain and other crops raised, and of all the stock of cattle, 
sheep, hogs, etc. He seems so pleasant, and anxious to have me 
continue, that I cannot tear away from him. He is in quite as good 
spirits since he came home as I expected. 

We are all in good health ; so also was father and other Hudson 
friends a few days ago. Our sheep, cattle, etc., have done very well 
through the winter. Got a letter from Ruth a few days ago. All 
appears well with them. She writes that they have had quite a 
revival of religion there, and that Henry is one of the hopefully converted. My earnest and only wish is, that those seeming conversions 
may prove genuine, as I doubt not " there is joy over one sinner that repenteth." Will you write me ?

DEAR CHILDREN, We received Henry s letter of the 16th August 
in due time, and when it came I intended to reply at once ; but not 
being very stout, and having many things to look after, it has been 
put off until now. We were very glad of that letter, and of the 
information it gave of your health and prosperity, as well as your 
future calculations. We have some nice turkeys and chickens fatten 
ing, to be ready by the time you come on to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a>. Father and 
Jason were both here this morning. Father is quite well. Jason, 
Ellen, Owen, and Fred have all been having the ague more or less 
since I wrote before. Other friends are in usual health, I believe. 
We have done part of our sowing, got our fine crop of corn all se 
cured against frosts yesterday, and are digging potatoes to-day. The 
season has been thus far one of great temporal blessing; and I would 
fain hope that the Spirit of God has not done striving in our hard 
hearts. I sometimes feel encouraged to hope that my sons will give 
up their miserable delusions and believe in God and in his Son our 
Saviour. I think the family are more and more decided in favor of 
returning to Essex, and seem all disposed to be making little prepa 
rations for it as we suppose the time draws near. Our county fair 
comes off on the 12th and 13th October, but we suppose we can 
hardly expect you so soon. Should be much pleased to have you 
here then. . . .

DEAR CHILDREN, I remember I engaged to write you so soon as 
I had anything to tell worth the paper. I do not suppose the balance 
will be great now. So far as I know, the friends here are about in 
usual health, and are passing through the winter prosperously. My 
wife is not in as good health as when you were here. Have not 
heard from Hudson for some days. The loss of sheep has been merely 
a nominal one with us. We have skinned two full-blood Devon 
heifers, from the effects of poison, as we suspect; for several of our 
young cattle were taken sick about the same time. The others appear 
to be nearly well. 

This world is not yet freed from real malice or envy. It appears 
to be well settled now that we go back to North Elba in the spring. 
I have had a good-natured talk with Mr. Perkins about going away, 
and both families are now preparing to carry out that plan. I do 
not yet know what his intentions are about our compensation for the 
last year. 1 Will write you when I do, as I want you to hold yourself 
(John, I mean) in readiness to come out at once, should he decide to 
give me a share of the stock, etc. Should that be the case, I intend 
to let you have what will give you a little start in the way of red 
cattle. 

I learn, by your letters to others of the family, that you have pretty 
much decided to call your boy John, and that in order to gratify the 
feelings of his great-grandfather and grandfather. I will only now 
say that I hope to be able sometime to convince yon that I appreciate 
the sacrifices you may make to accommodate our feelings. I noticed 
your remark about the family settling near each other; to this I 
would say, I would like to have my posterity near enough to each 
other to be friendly, but would never wish them to be brought so in 
contact as to be near neighbors or to intermarry. I may possibly 
write you again very soon.

DEAR SON JOHN, I write by direction of Mr. Perkins to ask you 
to come out immediately to assist him, instead of Mr. Newton, in 
closing up my accounts. He has seen the above, and it is a thing of 
his own naming ; so I want you, if possible, to come right away. 
He has told me he intends to give me one share, but would like to 
have the stock mostly. We are on excellent terms, so far as I know. 
All well except my wife, and I hope she will soon be better.

DEAR SON JOHN, Since writing you before, I have agreed to go 
on to the Ward place for one year, as I found I could not dispose of 
my stuff in time to go to North Elba without great sacrifice this 
spring. We expect to move the first of next week, and do not wish 
you to come on until we get more settled and write you again. As I 
am not going away immediately, there will be no particular hurry 
about the settlement I wrote about before. On reckoning up our 
expenses for the past year, we find we have been quite prosperous. I 
have sold my interest in the increase of sheep to Mr. Perkins for 
about $700, in hogs for $51, in wheat on the ground for $176. These 
will pay our expenses for the year past, and the next year s rent for 
the Ward place, Crinlen place, and Old Portage place. These places 
I get for one year in exchange for my interest in wheat on the 
ground ; and it leaves me half the wool of last season (which is on 
hand yet), half the pork, corn, wheat, oats, hay, potatoes, and 
calves sixteen in number. If I could have sold my share of the wool, 
I might have gone to Essex this spring quite comfortably ; but I 
have to pay Henry $100 before he leaves, and I cannot do that and 
have sufficient to move with until I can sell my wool. We are all 
middling well. Henry and Ruth intend to leave for home about the 
15th March, and to go by your place if they can. We have great 
reason to be thankful that we have had so prosperous a year, and 
have terminated our connection with Mr. Perkins so comfortably and 
on such friendly terms, to all appearance. Perry Warren, to whom 
Henry Warren conveyed his property, was here a few days ago, feel 
ing about for a compromise : did nothing, and left, to return again 
soon as he said. We think they are getting tired of the five years 
war. I shall probably write you again before a great while.

DEAR SON JOHN, We received your letter of the 24th March two 
or three days since, and one from Henry, dated 25th March, about the 
same time. They had got on well so far, but had to go by stage the 
balance of the way. Father got home well, and was with us over 
night Friday last. We have all been middling well of late, but very 
busy, having had the care of the whole concern at Mr. Perkins s place 
until Friday night. I had a most comfortable time settling last year s 
business, and dividing with Mr. Perkins, and have to say of his deal 
ing with me that he has shown himself to be every inch a gentle 
man. I bring to my new home five of the red cows and ten calves ; 
he to have $100 out of my share of the last year s wool, to make us 
even on last year s business ; after dividing all crops, he paying me 
in hand $28.55, balance due me on all except four of the five cows. 
I am going now to work with a cheap team of two yoke oxen, on 
which I am indebted, till I can sell my wool, $89 ; $46 I have paid 
towards them. I would like to have all my children settle within a 
few miles of each other and of me, but I cannot take the responsibility of advising you to make any forced move to change your location. 
Thousands have to regret that they did not let middling "well alone." 
I should think you ought to get for your place another $J25; and 
I think you may, if you are not too anxious. That would buy you 
considerable of a farm in Essex or elsewhere, and we may get the 
Homestead Law passed yet. It has been a question with me whether 
you would not do better to hire all your team work done than to have 
your little place overstocked possibly, after some trouble about buy 
ing them, paying taxes, insurance, and some expense for implements 
to use them with. If you get a little overstocked, everything will 
seem to do poorly. Frederick is very much better, but both he and 
Owen have been having the ague lately. They leave the Hill farm 
soon. I do not at this moment know of a good opening for you this 
way. One thing I do not fear to advise and even urge ; and that is 
the habitual " fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom." 
Commending you all to his mercy, I remain 

Your affectionate father,

DEAR CHILDREN, I have just received Henry s letter of the 
13th instant, and have much reason to be thankful for the good news 
it brings. We are all in middling health, so far as I know, in this 
quarter, although there is some sickness about us. Mother Brown, 
of Hudson, was complaining some last week ; have not heard from 
her since then. This part of the country is suffering the most dreadful drouth ever experienced during this nineteenth century. We 
have been much more highly favored than most of our neighbors in 
that we were enabled to secure a most excellent hay crop, whilst 
many others did not get theirs saved in time, and lost it notwith 
standing the dry weather. Our oats are no better than those of our 
neighbors, but we have a few. We shall probably have some corn, 
while others, to a great extent, will have none. Of garden vegetables 
we have more than twenty poor families have in many cases. Of 
fruit we shall have a comfortable supply, if our less favored neighbors do not take it all from us. We ought to be willing to divide. 
Our cattle (of which we have thirty-three head) we are enabled to 
keep in excellent condition, on the little feed that grows on the moist 
grounds, and by feeding the stalks green that have failed of corn, 
and we have a good many of them. We have had two light frosts, 
on August the 9th and 18th, but have had more extreme hot 
weather in July and August than ever known before, thermometer 
often up to 98 in the shade, and was so yesterday ; it now stands 
(eleven o clock p. M.) at 93. 

I am thinking that it may be best for us to dispose of all the cattla 
we want to sell, and of all our winter feed, and move a few choice 
cattle to North Elba this fall, provided we can there buy hay and 
other stuff considerably cheaper than we might sell our stuff for here, 
and also provided we can get a comfortable house to winter in. I 
want you to keep writing me often, as you can learn how hay, all 
kinds of grain, and roots can be bought with you, so that I may be the 
better able to judge. Our last year s pork proves to be a most perfect article, but I think not best to ship any until the weather gets a 
little cooler. The price Mr. Washburn asks for his contract may not 
be much out of the way, but there seems to be some difficulty about 
a bargain yet. First, he wants to hang on all his stock, and I do not 
know at present as I want any of them. I do not know what he has 
on hand ; he may perhaps be able to get them off himself. Then, 
again, I do not know as Mr. Smith 1 would give a deed of half the lot 
before the whole purchase-money for the entire lot and interest are 
paid. You may have further information than I have. Early in 
the season all kinds of cattle were high, scarce and ready cash; 
now, as the prospects are, I am entirely unable to make an estimate 
of what money I can realize on them, so as to be able to say just now 
how much money I can raise, provided those other impediments can 
be got over. I intend to turn all I consistently can into money, and 
as fast as I can, and would be glad to secure the purchase of Wash- 
burn, if it can be done consistently and without too much trouble. 
Write me again soon, and advise as far as you can about all these 
matters. We could probably sell all our produce at pretty high 
prices. How are cattle, horses, sheep, and hogs selling in your 
quarter ? 

Your affectionate father, 

JOHN BROWN,

DEAR CHILDREN, Last night your letters to Jason were received (dated December 26), and I had the reading of them. I 
conclude from the long time mine to you from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a> was on the 
way, that you did not reply to it. On my return here from North 
Elba I was disappointed of about three hundred dollars for cattle 
sold to brother Frederick, and am still in the same condition, he 
having gone to Illinois just before I left to go East, and not having 
returned nor written me a word since. This puts it out of my power 
to move my family at present, and will until I get my money, unless 
I sell off my Devon cattle, which I cannot, without great sacrifice, 
before spring opens. Your remarks about hay make me doubt the 
propriety of taking on any cattle till spring, as I have here an abun 
dance of feed. I am now entirely unable to say whether we can get 
off before spring or not. All are well here, so far as we know. Owen 
and Frederick were with their uncle Edward in Meridosia, 111. (where 
they expect to winter), on the 23d December; they were well, and 
much pleased with the country, and with him. You can write them 
at that place, care of Edward Lusk, Esq. I may send on one of the 
boys before the family go, but am not now determined. Can write 
no more now for want of time. Write me, on receipt of this, any and 
every thing of use or interest. 

Your affectionate father, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">JOHN BROWN</a>.

DEAR CHILDREN, I have deferred answering your very accept 
able letter of January 30 for one week, in the hope of having some 
news to write you about Owen and Frederick ; but they are so negli 
gent about writing that I have not a word to send now. I got quite 
an encouraging word about Kansas from Mr. Adair the other day. 
He had before given quite a gloomy picture of things. He and family were all. well. The friends here were all well a few days since. 
John and Wealthy have gone back to Vernon, John taking with him iny old surveyor s instruments, in consideration of having learned to 
survey. I have but little to write that will interest you, so I need 
not be lengthy. I think we may be able to get off in March, and I 
mean to sell some of our Devon cattle in order to effect it, if I can do 
no better. I should send on Watson within a few days, if I thought 
I could manage to get along with the family and cattle without his help. 
I may conclude to do so still before we get away. The last of January 
and February, up to yesterday, have been very remarkable for uninterrupted cold weather for this section. We were glad to learn that 
you had succeeded in getting the house so comfortable. I want 
Johnny should be so good a boy that " 95 will not turn him off." 
Can you tell whether the Stout lot was ever redeemed in December 
or not by the owners f

DEAR CHILDREN, I am here with my stock of cattle to sell, in 
order to raise funds so that I can move to North Elba, and think I 
may get them off in about two weeks. Oliver is here with me. We 
shall get on so late that we can put in no crops (which I regret), so 
that you had perhaps better plant or sow what you can conveniently 
on u 95." l I heard from John and Jason and their families (all 
well) at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a> on the 21st April, expecting to leave there on the

and corn are worth at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=westport" rel="city">Westport</a> now, as near as you can learn.

DEAR CHILDREN, I write just to say that I have sold my cattle 
without making much sacrifice, and expect to be on my way home 
to-morrow. Oliver expects to remain behind and go to Kansas. 
After I get home I expect to start with my family for North Elba as 
soon as we can get ready. We may possibly get off this week, but 
I hardly think we can. I have heard nothing further as yet from 
the boys in Kansas. All were well at home a few days since.

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, I reached here on the first day 
of the convention, and I have reason to bless God that I came ; for I have met with a most warm reception from all, so far as I know, 
and except by a few sincere, honest peace friends a most hearty 
approval of my intention of arming my sons and other friends in 
Kansas. I received to-day donations amounting to a little over sixty 
dollars, twenty from Gerrit Smith, five from an old British officer ; l 
others giving smaller sums with such earnest and affectionate expres 
sions of their good wishes as did me more good than money even. 
John s two letters were introduced, and read with such effect by Gerrit Smith as to draw tears from numerous eyes in the great collection 
of people present. The convention has been one of the most interesting meetings I ever attended in my life ; and I made a great 
addition to the number of warm-hearted and honest friends.

Letters from John Brown s Sons in Kansas to their Father. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=brownsville" rel="city">Brownsville</a>, BROWN Co., 2 K. T., 

Friday Morning, June 22, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1855">1855</a>. 

DEAR FATHER, Day before yesterday we received a letter from 
you dated <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=rockford" rel="city">Rockford</a>, 111., 24th May, which for some unaccountable 
cause has been very long delayed on the road. We are exceedingly glad to hear from you, and that you still intend coming on. 
Our health is now excellent, and our crops, cattle, and horses look 
finely. We have now about twelve acres of sod corn in the ground, 
more than a quarter acre of white beans, two and a half bushels seed 
potatoes planted and once hoed, besides a good garden containing corn, 
potatoes, beets, cabbages, turnips, a few onions, some peas, cucumbers, melons, squashes, etc. Jason s fruit-trees, grape-vines, etc., 
that survived the long period of transportation, look very well : probably more than half he started with are living, with the exception of 
peaches ; of these he has only one or two trees. As we arrived so 
late in the season, we have but little expectation of harvesting much 
com, and but few potatoes. The rainy season usually commences 
here early in April or before, and continues from six to eight weeks, 
during which a great amount of rain falls. This year we had no rain 
of any consequence before the 12th or 15th of May ; since then have 
had two heavy rains accompanied with some wind and most tremendous thunder and lightning ; have also had a number of gentle rains, 
continuing from one to twenty-four hours ; but probably not more 
than half the usual fall of rain has yet come. As the season last 
year was irregular in this respect, probably this will be to some 
extent. We intend to keep our garden, beans, and some potatoes 
watered if we can, so as to have something if our corn should be a 
failure. As it is, the prospect is middling fair, and the ground is ploughed ready for early planting next year. Old settlers here say that 
people should calculate on having the spring s sowing and planting 
all done by the middle of April ; in that case their crops are more 
abundant. The prairies are covered with grass, which begins to 
wave in the wind most beautifully ; shall be able to cut any quantity of this, and it is of far better quality than I had any idea. 

In answer to your questions : Good oxen are from $50 to $80 per 
yoke, have been higher; common cows, from $15 to $25, prob 
ably will riot be higher ; heifers in proportion. Limited demand as 
yet for fine stock. Very best horses from $100 to $150 each ; aver 
age fair to good, $75 to $80. No great demand now for cattle or 
horses. A good strong buggy would sell well, probably a Lumberee best. Mr. Adair has had several chances to sell his. Very few 
Lumberee buggies among the settlers. White beans, $5 per bushel ; 
corn meal, $1.75 per bushel of fifty pounds, tending downward ; 
flour, $7 per hundred pounds ; dried apples, 12i cents per pound ; 
bacon, 12 to 14 cents here; fresh beef, 5 to 6 cents per pound. 
Enclosed is a slip cut from a late number of the u Kansas Tribune 7 
giving the markets there, which differ somewhat from prices in this 
section. It is the paper published at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> by the Speers. 

I have no doubt it would be much cheaper and healthier for you 
to come in the way you propose, with a " covered lumber buggy and 
one horse or mule," especially from St Louis here. The navigation 
of the Missouri River, except by the light-draught boats recently built 
for the Kansas River, is a horrid business in a low stage of water, 
which is a considerable portion of the year. You will be able to see 
much more of the country on your way, and if you carry some pro 
visions along it is altogether the cheaper mode of travelling ; besides, 
such a conveyance is just what you want here to carry on the business of surveying. You can have a good road here whithersoever 
you may wish to go. Flour, white beans, and dried fruit will doubt 
less continue for some time to come to be high. It is believed that 
a much larger emigration will arrive here this fall than before. 
Should you buy anything to send by water, you can send it either to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, thirty-five miles north of us, or to Kansas City, Mo., care 
of Walker & Chick, sixty miles northeast of us. 

A surveyor would soon find that great numbers are holding more 
land, and especially timber, than can be covered by 160 acres, or 
even 320, and that great numbers are holding claims for their 
friends ; so that I have no doubt people will find a sufficient amount 
of timber yet for a long time. Owing to the rapid settlement of the 
country by squatters, it does not open a good field for speculators. 

The land on which we are located was ceded by the Pottawatomie 
Indians to the Government. The Ottawa lands are soon to be sold, 
each person of the tribe reserving and choosing two hundred acres ; 
the remainder open to pre-emption after their choice is made. The 
Peoria lands have been bargained for by the Government, and are to 
be sold to the highest bidder without reservation. But Missourians 
have illegally gone on to these Peoria lands, intending to combine 
and prevent their going higher than $1.25 per acre, and then claim, 
if they go higher, a large amount of improvements, thus cheating 
the Indians. The Ottawas intend to divide into families, and cultivate the soil and the habits of civilized life, as many of them are 
now doing. They are a fine people. The Peorias are well advanced, 
and might do the same but for a bad bargain with our Government. 

[Here is drawn a plan of the Brown settlement or claim.] 

There is a town site recently laid out on the space marked "village 
plat ; " as there are two or three in sight, it is uncertain which will 
be taken. The semicircle is even ground, sloping every way, and 
affording a view in every way of from twenty to thirty miles in every 
direction, except one small point in the direction of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a> ; the 
view from this ground is beautiful beyond measure. The timbered 
lands on Middle Creek are covered with claims ; the claimants, many 
of them from Ohio, Illinois, and the East, are mostly Free-State 
folks. There are probably twenty families within five or six miles 
of us. 

Day before yesterday Owen and I ran the Peoria line east to see 
if there might not be found a patch of timber on some of the numerous small streams which put into the Osage, and which would be 
south of the Peoria line. We found on a clear little stream sufficient 
timber for a log-house, and wood enough to last say twenty families for 
two or three years, perhaps more, and until one could buy and raise 
more. Here a good claim could be made by some one. The prairie 
land which would be included is of the very best I have ever seen ; 
plenty of excellent stone on and adjoining it. Claims will soon be 
made here that will have no more than two or three acres of timber ; 
and after these are exhausted prairie claims will be taken, the claim 
ants depending on buying their timber. Already this is the case, and 
many are selling off twenty, thirty, and forty acres from their timber 
claims to those who have none. 

[The above, though, without signature, is in the handwrit 
ing of John Brown, Jr. ; and the plan of " Brown s Station " is drawn in his neat surveyor s manner. In the same 
envelope evidently went the two following letters from Jason 
Brown (familiarly called " Jay " by his family) and Salmon, 
the eldest son of the second marriage.]

DEAR FATHER, MOTHER, BROTHERS, AND SISTERS, We received a few days since a letter from mother, since then one from 
father, which we were all very glad to get. I should have written you before, but since we laid little Austin in the grave I have not felt as 
if I could write. I shall not attempt to say much now. We fully believe that Austin is happy with his Maker in another existence ; 
and if there is to be a separation of friends after death, we pray God to keep us in the way of truth, and that we may so run our short 
course as to be able to enjoy his company again. Ellen feels so lonely and discontented here without Austin, that we shall go back 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> next fall if she does not enjoy herself better. I am well pleased with the country, and can be as well content here as any 
where else if it proves to be healthy. It is a very rich and beautiful country. I should think it would be altogether best for father to 
come by land from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a>. Salmon has a very good claim (as well as the rest of us), and seems to be very much pleased with it. 
We are all living together in tents and in the wagon, and have no houses yet. I used all the money I had for freight and passage be 
fore I got here, and had to borrow of John. We have no stoves j I 
wish now that we had brought ours along. We would all like to 
hear from you often. All well. 

Your affectionate son and brother, 

J. L. BROWN. 

P. S. If you should come by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> on your way here, and could 
buy and box up a middle-sized stove and furniture, with about four 
lengths of pipe, and send or bring it to me at Kansas City, I will 
contrive some way to pay you for it. I think they can be got there 
and shipped here cheaper than they can be bought here. I would 
like to have you inquire* if you will.

DEAR FATHER, We received your letter from Eockford, 111., this 
week, and are very glad that you are going to get through there soon, 
and that you are going to be here before fall. In answer to your 
questions about what you will need for your company, 1 would say 
that I have one acre of corn that looks very well, and some beans and 
squashes and turnips. You will want to get some pork and meal, 
and beans enough to last till the crop comes in, and then I think 
we will have enough grain to last through the winter. I will have a 
house up by the time that you will get here. My boots are very near 
worn out, and I shall need some summer pants and a hat- I bought 
an axe, and that you will not have to get. There are slaves owned 
within three miles of us.

DEAR MOTHER, I just received yours of the 31st, and also of 
the 1st, and was very much pleased to hear that you were all well. 
I also received letters from father and Ruth at the same time, which 
I was very glad to get ; but I much more expected to see father than 
to hear from him. My health is very good at present, but has been 
very poor for a week or ten days back. I am working now for a man 
named Goodrich, getting $1.50 per day, which I have to earn, every 
cent of it. I never worked so hard before. I am quite sorry to hear 
that you are likely to have rather tough times of it for a year to come. 
Was I certain that father would not be distressed for money when he 
gets here, I would send you enough to buy another cow; but I think 
we must try and see what we can do for you when we get to Kansas. 
Have written to Salmon twice, but have received no answer as yet. 
My shirts hold out very well so far, but I think the ones you were 
going to send by father will come in play in course of the season. 
I very much hope to see Alexis Hinkley with him. Should much 
like to have Watson with us, but do not see that it is possible. I 
hope to see you all in Kansas in the course of a year or two. It has 
been very dry here, but crops look very well. I received that receipt 
for cholera medicine, and went at once and got the whole dose mixed 
up. I do not think of more at present, so please all write me soon ; 
and Wat. you must spur up about writing, and Anna too.

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, I see that Henry

We have a nice young horse, for which we paid here $120, but have 
so much load that we shall have to walk a good deal enough prob 
ably to supply ourselves with game. We have provided ourselves 
with the most of what we need on our outward march. If you get 
this on Tuesday and answer it on Wednesday, some of you directing 
on the outside to Oliver, at Rock Island, 111., we should probably get 
your answer there. Oliver s name is not so common as either Henry s

SCOTT COUNTY, IOWA, Sept. 4 [<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1855">1855</a>], in Morning. 

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, ALL, I am writing in our tent 
about twenty miles west of the Mississippi, to let you know that we 
are all in good health and how we get along. We had some delay 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">Chicago</a> on account of our freight not getting on as we expected j 
while there we bought a stout young horse that proves to be a very 
good one, but he has been unable to travel fast for several days from 
having taken the distemper. We think he appears quite as well as 
he has, this morning ; and we hope he will not fail us. Our load is 
heavy, so that we have to walk most of the time ; indeed, all the 
time the last day. The roads are mostly very good, and we can make some progress if our horse does not fail us. We fare very well 
on crackers, herring, boiled eggs, prairie chicken, tea, and sometimes a 
little milk. Have three chickens now cooking for our breakfast. We 
shoot enough of them on the wing as we go along to supply us with 
fresh meat. Oliver succeeds in bringing them down quite as well as 
any of us. Our expenses before we got away from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">Chicago</a> had been 
very heavy; since then very light, so that we hope our money will 
not entirely fail us ; but we shall not have any of account left when 
we get through. 

We expect to go direct through Missouri, and if we are not obliged 
to stop on account of our horse, shall soon be there. We mean to 
write you often when we can. We got to Rock Island too soon for any letter from you, but shall not be too early at Kansas City, where 
we hope to hear from you. The country through which we have travelled from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">Chicago</a> has been mostly very good ; the worst fault 
is want of living streams of water. With all the comforts we have 
along our journey, I think, could I hope in any other way to answer the end of my being, I would be quite content to be at North Elba. 

I have directed the sale of the cattle in Connecticut, and to have 
the rest sent in a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> draft payable to Watson s order, which 
I hope will make you all quite comfortable. Watson should get 
something more at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=elizabethtown" rel="city">Elizabethtown</a>. than the mere face of the draft. 
He will need to write his name across the back of the draft when he 
sells it : about two inches from the top end would be the proper place. 
I want you to make the most of the money you get, as I expect to be 
very poor about money from any other source. Commend you all to 
the mercy and infinite grace of God. I bid you all good-by for this 
time.

Saturday Eve. 

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, We reached the 
place where the boys are located one week ago, late at night; at 
least Henry and Oliver did. I, being tired, stayed behind in our 
tent, a mile or two back. As the mall goes from here early Monday 
morning, we could get nothing here in time for that mail. We found 
all more or less sick or feeble but Wealthy and Johnny. 2 All at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=brownsville" rel="city">Brownsville</a> appear now to be mending, but all sick or feeble here at Mr. Adair s. Fever and agufc and chill-fever seem to be very general. 
Oliver has had a turn of the ague since he got here, but has got it 
broken. Henry has had no return since first breaking it. We met 
with no difficulty in passing through Missouri, but from the sickness 
of our horse and our heavy load. The horse has entirely recovered. 
We had, between us all, sixty cents in cash when we arrived. We 
found our folks in a most uncomfortable situation, with no houses to 
shelter one of them, no hay or corn fodder of any account secured, 
shivering over their little fires, all exposed to the dreadful cutting 
winds, morning and evening and stormy days. We have been trying 
to help them all in our power, and hope to get them more comfortable 
soon. I think much of their ill health is owing to most unreasonable 
exposure. Mr. Adair s folks would be quite comfortable if they were 
well. One letter from wife and Anne to Salmon, of August 10, and 
one from Ruth to John, of 19th September, is all I have seen from 
any of you since getting here. Henry found one from Ruth, which 
he has not shown me. Need I write that I shall be glad to hear 
from you ? I did not write while in Missouri, because I had no confidence in your getting my letters. We took up little Austin and 
brought him on here, which appears to be a great comfort to Jason 
and Ellen. We were all out a good part of the last night, helping 
to keep the prairie fire from destroying everything ; so that I am 
almost blind to-day, or I would write you more. 

Sabbath Eve, October 14. 

I notice in your letter to Salmon your trouble about the means of 
having the house made more comfortable for winter, and I fondly 
hope you have been relieved on that score before now, by funds 
from Mr. Hurlbut, of Winchester, Conn., from the sale of the cattle 
there. Write me all about your situation ; for, if disappointed from 
that source, I shall make every effort to relieve you in some other 
way. Last Tuesday was an election clay with Free- State men in 
Kansas, and hearing that there was a prospect of difficulty we all 
turned out most thoroughly armed (except Jason, who was too feeble) ; but no enemy appeared, nor have I heard of any disturbance 
in any part of the Territory. Indeed, I believe Missouri is fast be 
coming discouraged about making Kansas a slave State, and I think 
the prospect of its becoming free is brightening every day. Try to 
be cheerful, and always ll hope in God," who will not leave nor for 
sake them that trust in him. Try to comfort and encourage each 
other all you can. You are all very dear to me, and I humbly trust 
we may be kept and spared to meet again on earth ; but if not, let 
us all endeavor earnestly to secure admission to that eternal home, 
where will be no more bitter separations, " where the wicked shall 
cease from troubling and the weary be at rest." We shall probably 
spend a few days more in helping the boys to provide some kind of 
shelter for winter, and mean to write you often. May God in infinite 
mercy bless, comfort, and save you all, for Christ s sake !

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, We last week received Watson s letter of October 3, too late to answer till now. I 
felt grateful to learn that you were all then well, and I think I fully 
sympathize with you in all the hardships and discouragements you 
have to meet ; but you may be assured you are not alone in having 
trials. I believe I wrote you that we found every one here more or less 
unwell but Wealthy and Johnny, without any sort of a place where 
a stout man even could protect himself from the cutting cold winds 
and storms, which prevail here (the winds, I mean, in particular) much 
more than in any place where we have ever lived ; and that no crops 
of hay or anything raised had been taken care of; with corn wasting 
by cattle and horses, without fences; and, I may add, without any 
meat ; and Jason s folks without sugar, or any kind of breadstuffs but 
corn ground with great labor in a hand-mill about two miles off. Since 
I wrote before, Wealthy, Johnny, Ellen, and myself have escaped 
being sick. Some have had the ague, but lightly ; but Jason and 
Oliver have had a hard time of it, and are yet feeble. They appear 
some better just now. Under existing circumstances we have made 
but little progress ; but we have made a little. We have got a shanty 
three logs high, chinked, and mudded, and roofed with our tent, and 
John has his shanty a little better fixed than it was, but miserable 
enough now; and we have got their little crop of beans secured, 
which, together with johunycake, mush and milk, pumpkins, and 
squashes, constitute our fare. Potatoes they have none of any ac 
count ; milk, beans, pumpkins, and squashes a very moderate supply, 
just for the present use. We have also got a few house- logs cut for 
Jason. I do not send you this account to render you more unhappy, 
but merely to let you know that those here are not altogether in 
paradise, while you have to stay in that miserable frosty region. 
We had here, October 25, the hardest freezing I ever witnessed south 
of North Elba at that season of the year. 

After all, God s tender mercies are not taken from us, and blessed 
be his name forever ! I believe things will a little brighten here 
before long, and as the winter approaches, and that we may be able 
to send you a more favorable account. There is no proper officer 
before whom a deed can be acknowledged short of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, and 
Jason and Owen have not been able to go there at all since we got 
here. I want to learn very much whether you have received any 
return from the cattle of Mr. Hurlbut, in Connecticut, so that I may 
at once write him if you have riot. I trust you will not neglect this, 
as it takes so long to get letters through, and it will greatly lessen my 
anxiety about your being made in some measure comfortable for the 
winter. We hear that the fall has been very sickly in Ohio and other 
States. I can discover no reason why this country should continue 
sickly, but it has proven exceedingly so this fall. I feel more and 
more confident that slavery will soon die out here, and to God be 
the praise ! Commending you all to his infinite grace, I remain 
Your affectionate husband and father,

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, ALL, Ruth s letter to Henry, 
saying she was about moving, and dated 23d October (I think), 
was received by last week s mail. We were all glad to learn again 
of your welfare ; and as to your all staying in one house, I can see 
no possible objection, if you can only be well agreed, and try to make each other as comfortable as may be. Nothing new of account 
has occurred amongst us since I wrote. Henry, Jason, and Oliver 
are unable to do much yet, but appear to have but little ague now. 
The others are all getting middling well. We have got both families 
so sheltered that they need not suffer hereafter ; have got part of the 
hay (which had lain in cocks) secured; made some progress in preparation to build a house for John and Owen ; and Salmon has caught 
a prairie wolf in the steel trap. We continue to have a good deal of 
stormy weather, rains with severe winds, and forming into ice as 
they fall, together with cold nights that freeze the ground consider 
ably. " Still God has not forsaken us," and we get " day by day 
our daily bread," and I wish we all had a great deal more gratitude 
to mingle with our undeserved blessings. Much suffering would be 
avoided by people settling in Kansas, were they aware that they 
would need plenty of warm clothing and light warm houses as much 
as in New Hampshire or Vermont; for such is the fact. 

Since Watson wrote, I have felt a great deal troubled about your 
prospects of a cold house to winter in, and since I wrote last I have 
thought of a cheap ready way to help it much, at any rate. Take 
any common straight-edged boards, and run them from the ground 
up to the eaves, barn fashion, riot driving the nails in so far but that 
they may easily be drawn, covering all but doors and windows as 
close as may be in that way, and breaking joints if need be. This 
can be done by any one, and in any weather not very severe, and the 
boards may afterwards be mostly saved for other uses. I think much, 
too, of your widowed state, and I sometimes allow myself to dream a 
little of again some time enjoying the comforts of home ; but I do 
not dare to dream much. May God abundantly reward all your 
sacrifices for the cause of humanity, and a thousandfold more than 
compensate yonr lack of worldly connections ! We have received two 
newspapers you sent us, which were indeed a great treat, shut away 
as we are from the means of getting the news of the day. Should 
you continue to direct them to some of the boys, after reading, we 
should prize them much. 

Your affectionate husband and father,

WESTON, Mo., November 30. 

The greatest excitement continues to exist in Kansas. The officers have been resisted by the mobocrats, and the interposition of the 
militia has been called for. A secret letter from Secretary Woodson 
to General Eastin has been written, in which the writer requests 
General Eastin to call for the Rifle Company at Platte City, Mo., 
so as not to compromise Governor Shannon. Four hundred men 
from Jackson County are now en route for Douglas County, K. T. 
St. Joseph and Weston are requested to furnish each the same number. The people of Kansas are to be subjugated at all hazards.

Sabbath Evening. 

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, I improve the first mail since my return from the camp of volunteers, who lately turned 
out for the defence of the town of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> in this Territory; and not withstanding I suppose you have learned the result before this (possibly) , will give a brief account of the invasion in my own way. 

About three or four weeks ago news came that a Free-State man by the name of Dow had been murdered by a proslavery man by 
the name of Coleman, who had gone and given himself up for trial to the proslavery Governor Shannon. This was soon followed by further news that a Free-State man who was the only reliable witness against the murderer had been seized by a Missourian (appointed 
sheriff by the bogus Legislature of Kansas) upon false pretexts, examined, and held to bail under such heavy bonds, to answer to those 
false charges, as he could not give; that while on his way to trial, 
in charge of the bogus sheriff, he was rescued by some men belong 
ing to a company near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>; and that in consequence of the 
rescue Governor Shannon had ordered out all the proslavery force he 
could muster in the Territory, and called on Missouri for further help ; 
that about two thousand had collected, demanding a surrender of the 
rescued witness and of the rescuers, the destruction of several buildings and printing-presses, and a giving up of the Sharpe s rifles by 
the Free-State men, threatening to destroy the town with cannon, 
with which they were provided, etc. ; that about an equal number of 
Free-State men had turned out to resist them, and that a battle was 
hourly expected or supposed to have been already fought. 

These reports appeared to be well authenticated, but we could get 
no further account of matters ; and I left this for the place where the 
boys are settled, at evening, intending to go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> to learn 
the facts the next day. John was, however, started on horseback ; 
but before he had gone many rods, word came that our help was im 
mediately wanted. On getting this last news, it was at once agreed 
to break up at John s camp, and take Wealthy and- Johnny to Jason s 
camp (some two miles off), and that all the men but Henry, Jason, 
and Oliver should at once set on" for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> under arms ; those 
three being wholly unfit for duty. We then set about providing a little 
corn-bread and meat, blankets, and cooking utensils, running bullets 
and loading all our guns, pistols, etc. ,The five set off in the after 
noon, and after a short rest in the night (which was quite dark), continued our march until after daylight next morning, when we got our 
breakfast, started again, and reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> in the forenoon, all of 
us more or less larned by our tramp. On reaching the place we found 
that negotiations had commenced between Governor Shannon (having 
a force of some fifteen or sixteen hundred men) and the principal 
leaders of the Free-State men, they having a force of some five hundred men at that time. These were busy, night and day, fortifying 
the town with embankments and circular earthworks, up to the time 
of the treaty with the Governor, as an attack was constantly looked 
for, notwithstanding the negotiations then pending. This state of 
things continued from Friday until Sunday evening. 1 On the even 
ing we left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a> a company of the invaders, of from fifteen to 
twenty-five, attacked some three or four Free-State men, mostly un 
armed, killing a Mr. Barber from Ohio, wholly unarmed. His body 
was afterward brought in and lay for some days in the room afterward occupied by a part of the company to which we belong (it being 
organized after we reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>). The building was a large 
unfinished stone hotel, in which a great part of the volunteers were 
quartered, who witnessed the scene of bringing in the wife and other 
friends of the murdered man. I will only say of this scene that it was 
heart-rending, and calculated to exasperate the men exceedingly, and 
one of the sure results of civil war. 

After frequently calling on the leaders of the Free- State men to 
come and have an interview with him, by Governor Shannon, and 
after as often getting for an answer that if he had any business to 
transact with any one in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, to come and attend to it, he 
signified his wish to come into the town, 1 and an escort was sent to 
the invaders camp to conduct him in. When there, the leading Free- 
State men, finding out his weakness, frailty, and consciousness of the 
awkward circumstances into which he had really got himself, took 
advantage of his cowardice and folly, and by means of that and the 
free use of whiskey and some trickery succeeded in getting a written 
arrangement with him much to their own liking. He stipulated with 
them to order the proslavery men of Kansas home, and to proclaim 
to the Missouri invaders that they must quit the Territory without 
delay, and also to give up General Pomeroy (a prisoner in their 
camp), which was all done; he also recognizing the volunteers as 
the militia of Kansas, and empowering their officers to call them out 
whenever in their discretion the safety of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> or other portions 
of the Territory might require it to be done. He (Governor Shan 
non) gave up all pretension of further attempt to enforce the enactments of the bogus Legislature, and retired, subject to the derision 
and scoffs of the Free-State men (into whose hands he had committed 
the welfare and protection of Kansas), and to the pity of some and 
the curses of others of the invading force. 

So ended this last Kansas invasion, the Missourians returning 
with flying colors, after incurring heavy expenses, suffering great exposure, hardships, and privations, not having fought any battles, 
burned or destroyed any infant towns or Abolition presses ; leaving the Free-State men organized and armed, and in full possession of 
the Territory; not having fulfilled any of all their dreadful threatenings, except to murder one unarmed man, and to commit some robberies and waste of property upon defenceless families, unfortunately within their power. We learn by their papers that they boast of a 
great victory over the Abolitionists ; and well they may. Free-State men have only hereafter to retain the footing they have gained, 
and Kansas is free. Yesterday the people passed upon the Free-State constitution. The result, though not yet known, no one doubts. 

One little circumstance, connected with our own number, showing 
a little of the true character of those invaders : On our way, about 
three miles from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, we had to pass a bridge (with our arms 
and ammunition) of which the invaders held possession ; but as the 
five of us had each a gun, with two large revolvers in a belt exposed 
to view, with a third in his pocket, and as we moved directly on to 
the bridge without making any halt, they for some reason suffered 
us to pass without interruption, notwithstanding there were some 
fifteen to twenty-five (as variously reported) stationed in a log-house 
at one end of the bridge. We could not count them. A boy on our 
approach ran and gave them notice. Five others of our company, 
well armed, who followed us some miles behind, met with equally 
civil treatment the same day. After we left to go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, 
until we returned when disbanded, I did not see the least sign of 
cowardice or want of self-possession exhibited by any volunteer of 
the eleven companies who constituted the Free-State force; and I 
never expect again to see an equal number of such well-behaved, cool, determined men, fully, as I believe, sustaining the high character of the Revolutionary fathers. But enough of this, as we intend 
to send you a paper giving a more full account of the affair. We 
have cause for gratitude in that we all returned safe and well, with 
the exception of hard colds, and found those left behind rather improving. 

We have received fifty dollars from father, and learn from him that he has sent you the same amount, for which we ought to be 
grateful, as we are much relieved, both as respects ourselves and you. The mails have been kept back during the invasion, but we hope to 
hear from you again soon. Mr. Adair s folks are well, or nearly so. Weather mostly pleasant, but sometimes quite severe. No snow of 
account as yet. Can think of but little more to-night. 

Monday Morning, December 17. 

The ground for the first time is barely whitened with snow, and it is quite cold ; but we have before had a good deal of cold weather, with 
heavy rains. Henry and Oliver and, I may [say] , Jason were disappointed in not being able to go to war. The disposition at both our 
camps to turn out was uniform. I believe I have before acknowledged the receipt of a letter from you and Watson. Have just taken 
one from the office for Henry that I think to be from Ruth. Do write often, and let me know all about how you get along through 
the winter. May God abundantly bless you all, and make you faithful. 

Your affectionate husband and father,

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, Yours and Watson s 
letters to the boys and myself, of December 30 and January 1, were 
received by last mail. We are all very glad to hear again of your 
welfare, and I am particularly grateful when I am noticed by a letter 
from you. I have just taken out two letters for Henry [Thompson], 
one of which, I suppose, is from Ruth. Salmon and myself are so 
far on our way home from Missouri, and only reached Mr. Adair s 
last night. They are all well, and we know of nothing but all are 
well at the boys shanties. The weather continues very severe, and 
it is now nearly six weeks that the snow has been almost constantly 
driven, like dry sand, by the fierce winds of Kansas. Mr. Adair has 
been collecting ice of late from the Osage River, which is nine and 
a half inches thick, of perfect clear solid ice, formed under the 
snow. By means of the sale of our horse and wagon, our present 
wants are tolerably well met, so that, if health is continued to us, we 
shall not probably suffer much. The idea of again visiting those of 
my dear family at North Elba is so calculated to unman me, that I 
seldom allow my thoughts to dwell upon it, and I do not think best 
to write much about it ; suffice it to say, that God is abundantly 
able to keep both us and you, and in him let ns all trust. We have 
just learned of some new and shocking outrages at Leavenworth, and 
that the Free-State people there have fled to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, which 
place is again threatened with an attack. Should that take place, 
we may soon again be called upon to li buckle on our armor," which 
by the help of God we will do, when T suppose Henry and Oliver 
will have a chance. My judgment is, that we shall have no general 
disturbance until warmer weather. I have more to say, but not time 
now to say it ; so farewell for this time. Write !

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, ... Thermometer on Sunday and Monday at twenty-eight to twenty-^nine below zero. 
Tee in the river, in the timber, and under the snow, eighteen inches thick this week. On our return to where the boys live we found 
Jason again down with the ague, but he was some better yesterday. Oliver was also laid up by freezing his toes, one great toe so badly 
frozen that the nail has come off. He will be crippled for some days yet. Owen has one foot some frozen. We have middling tough 
times (as some would call them), but have enougli to eat, and abundant reasons for the most unfeigned gratitude. It is likely that when 
the snow goes off, such high water will prevail as will render it difficult for Missouri to invade the Territory ; so that God by his elements 
may protect Kansas for some time yet. . . . Write me as to all your wants for the coming spring and summer. I hope you will all be led 
to seek G-od " with your whole heart; " and I pray him. in his mercy, to be found of you. All mail communications are entirely cut off by 
the snowdrifts, so that we get no news whatever this week. . . .

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, Your letter to 
Salmon, and Ruth s to Henry and Ellen, of 6th and 16th January, 
were received by last week s mail. This week we get neither letter 
nor paper from any of you. I need not continually repeat that we 
are always glad to hear from you. and to learn of your welfare. I 
wish that to be fully understood. Salmon and myself are here again, 
on our way back from Missouri, where we have been for corn, as 
what the boys had raised was used up, stock and families having to 
live on it mainly while it lasted. We had to pay thirty cents per 
bushel for corn. Salmon has had the ague again, while we have 
been gone, and had a hard shake yesterday. To-day is his well day. 
We found Henry and Frederick here helping Mr. Adair ; and I have 
been helping also yesterday and to-day. Those behind were as well 
as usual a day or two since. I have but little to write this time, 
except to tell you about the weather, and to complain of the almost 
lack of news from the United States. We are very anxious to 
know what Congress is doing. We hear that Frank Pierce means 
to crush the men of Kansas. I do not know how well he may succeed ; but I think he may find his hands full before it is all over. 
For a few days the snow has melted a little, and it begins to seem 
like early March in Ohio. I have agreed either to buy the line- 
backed cow of Henry, or to pay five dollars for the use of her and 
keep her a year, whichever may hereafter appear best ; so that, if 
she lives, you can calculate on the use of her. I have also written 
Mr. Hurlbut, of Connecticut, further in regard to the cattle, and 
think you will soon hear something from him. No more now. May 
God Almighty bless you and all good friends at North Elba !

MY DEAR SIR, We shall do all we can, but we are in a minority, and are dependent on the " Know Nothings" for aid to effect 
anything, and they are in a very doubtful position ; we know not how they will act. All I can say is, we shall try to relieve you. In the 
mean time you need have no fear of the troops. The President never will dare employ the troops of the United States to shoot the citizens of Kansas. The death of the first man by the troops will involve every free State in your own fate. It will light up the fires of 
civil war throughout the North, and we shall stand or fall with you. Such an act will also bring the President so deep in infamy that the 
hand of political resurrection will never reach him. Your safety depends on the supply of men and arms and money which will move 
forward to your relief as soon as the spring opens. I am confident there will be as many people in Kansas next winter as can be supplied with provisions. I may be mistaken, but I feel confident there will be no war in Kansas.

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, I wrote you last week, enclosing <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> draft for thirty dollars, made payable to 
Watson ; twenty dollars of which were to be given to Ruth, in part payment for the spotted cow, the balance to be used as circumstances 
might require. I would have sent you more, but I had no way to do it, arid money is very scarce with me indeed. Since I wrote last, three letters have been received by the boys from Ruth, dated March 5 and 9, and one of same date from Watson. The general tone of those letters I like exceedingly. We do not want you to borrow trouble about us, but trust us to the care of " Him who feeds the young 
ravens when they cry." I have, as usual, but little to write. We 
are doing off a house for Orson Day, which we hope to get through 
with soon ; after which we shall probably soon leave this neighbor 
hood, but will advise you further when we do leave. It may be that Watson can manage to get a little money for shearing sheep if you 
do not get any from Connecticut. I still hope you will get help from that source. We have no wars as yet, but we still have abundance 
of " rumors." We still have frosty nights, but the grass starts a little. There are none of us complaining much just now, all being 
able to do something. John has just returned from Topeka, 1 not having met with any difficulty ; but we hear that preparations are 
making in the United States Court for numerous arrests of FreeState men. 2 For one, I have no desire (all things considered) to 
have the slave-power cease from its acts of aggression. u Their foot shall slide in due time." No more now. May God bless and keep you all!

NEAR BROWNS STATION, K. T., June, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1856">1856</a>. 

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, It is now about five weeks since I have seen a line from North Elba, or had any chance 
of writing you. During that period we here have passed through 
an almost constant series of very trying events. We were called to 
go to the relief of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, May 22, and every man (eight in all), 
except Orson, turned out; he staying with the women and children, 
and to take care of the cattle. 1 John was captain of a company to 
which Jason belonged ; the other six were a little company by our 
selves. On our way to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> we learned that it had been already 
destroyed, and we encamped with John s company overnight. Next 
day our little company left, and during the day we stopped and 
searched three men. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> was destroyed in this way : Their leading men had (as 
I think) decided, in a very cowardly manner, not to resist any process having any Government official to serve it, notwithstanding the 
process might be wholly a bogus affair. The consequence was that 
a man called a United States marshal came on with a horde of 
ruffians which he called his posse, and after arresting a few persons 
turned the ruffians loose on the defenceless people. They robbed the 
inhabitants of their money and other property, and even women of 
their ornaments, and burned considerable of the town. 

On the second day and evening after we left John s men we 
encountered quite a number of proslavery men, and took quite a number prisoners. Our prisoners we let go ; but we kept some four 
or five horses. We were immediately after this accused of murdering 
five men at Pottawatomie, and great efforts have since been made by 
the Missourians and their ruffian allies to capture us. John s company soon afterward disbanded, and also the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a> men. Jason started to go and place himself under the protection of the 
Government troops ; but on his way he was taken prisoner by the 
Bogus men, and is yet a prisoner, I suppose. John tried to hide for 
several days ; but from feelings of the ungrateful conduct of those 
who ought to have stood by him, excessive fatigue, anxiety, and constant loss of sleep, he became quite insane, and in that situation 
gave up, or, as we are told, was betrayed at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a> into the 
hands of the Bogus men. We do not know all the truth about this 
affair. He has since, we are told, been kept in irons, and brought to 
a trial before a bogus court, the result of which we have not yet 
learned. We have great anxiety both for him and Jason, and 
numerous other prisoners with the enemy (who have all the while 
had the Government troops to sustain them). We can only commend 
them to God.

With this chapter of Brown s commentaries on the Kansas war may properly go the following papers, although 
they were not written until some months later, the first 
in August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1856">1856</a>, and the second after Brown left Kansas 
in October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1856">1856</a>. The first is addressed to his friend Ed 
mund B. Whitman, who then lived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>. 

For Mr. Whitman. 

Names of sufferers and persons who have made sacrifices in endeavoring to maintain and advance the Free-State cause in Kansas, 
within my personal knowledge. 

1. Two German refugees (thoroughly Free-State), robbed at Pot- 
tawatomie, named Benjamin and Bondy (or Bandy). One has served 
under me as a volunteer ; namely, Bondy. Benjamin was prisoner 
for some time. Suffered by men under Coffee and Pate. 

2. Henry Thompson. Devoted several months to the Free-State 
cause, travelling nearly two thousand miles at his own expense for 
the purpose, leaving family and business for about one year. Served 
under me as a volunteer ; was dangerously wounded at Palmyra, or 
Black Jack ; has a bullet lodged beside his backbone ; has had a 
severe turn of fever, and is still very feeble. Suffered a little in burn 
ing of the houses of John Brown, Jr., and Jason Brown. 

3. John, Jr., and Jason Brown. Both burned out ; both prisoners 
for some time, one a prisoner still ; both losing the use of valuable, 
partially improved claims. Both served repeatedly as volunteers for 
defence of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> and other places, suffering great hardships and 
some cruelty. 

4. Owen and Frederick Brown. Both served at different periods 
as volunteers under me; were both in the battle of Palmyra j both 
suffered by the burning of their brothers houses ; both have had 
sickness (Owen a severe one), and are yet feeble. Both lost the use 
of partially improved claims and their spring and summer work. 

5. Salmon Brown (minor). Twice served under me as a volun 
teer; was dangerously wounded (if not permanently crippled) by 
accident near Palmyra ; had a severe sickness, and still feeble. 

6. Oliver Brown (minor). Served under me as a volunteer for 
some months; was in the battle of Palmyra, and had some sickness. 

7. [B. L.J Cochrau (at Pottawatomie). Twice served under me 
as a volunteer ; was in the battle of Palmyra. 1 

8. Dr. Lucius Mills devoted some months to the Free-State cause, 
collecting and giving information, prescribing for and nursing the 
sick and wounded at his own cost. Is a worthy Free-State man. 

9. John Brown has devoted the service of himself and two minor 
sons to the Free-State cause for more than a year ; suffered by the 
fire before named and by robbery ; has gone at his own cost for that 
period, except that he and his company together have received forty 
dollars in cash, two sacks of flour, thirty-five pounds bacon, thirty- 
five do. sugar, and twenty pounds rice. 

I propose to serve hereafter in the Free-State cause (provided my 
needful expenses can be met), should that be desired; and to raise a 
small regular force to serve on the same condition. My own means 
are so far exhausted that I can no longer continue in the service 
at present without the means of defraying my expenses are furnished me. 

I can give the names of some five or six more volunteers of special 
merit I would be glad to have particularly noticed in some way.

MR. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">JOHN BROWN</a>. 

DEAR SIR, Respecting the account you have against us as a band, I would respect 
fully inform you that I have presented the matter before them two or three different 
times, and 1 cannot persuade them but what was paid by them was all that could be 
reasonably demanded of them, from the bargain they entered into with Jones the agent. 
For my part, I think the charge is just, and it ought to be paid. The Ottawa payment 
comes off some time this week, and I will present your case before them again, and do 
what I can to induce them to attend to the account, though I entertain no hopes of its 
being allowed ; but nothing like trying. In contributing my mite in aiding you in your 
benevolent enterprise, I enclose you ten dollars on the State Bank of Indiana (I presume 
it is good, though hundreds of other banks are worthless), and throw in the young 
man s bill and horse-hire, which amounts to four dollars. Accept it, sir, as a free-will 
offering from your friend. 

Times are coming round favorably in Kansas. Mr. Parrott for Congress will have 
8,000 to 10,000 majority over Ransom, and both branches of the Legislature the same in 
proportion. I am quite encouraged that all things will work together for good for those 
who are trying to work out righteousness in the land. May God bless you in your work 
whom I well know, with his head all bruised over aiid his throat 
partly cut, having before been dragged, while sick, out of the house of 
Ottawa Jones, the Indian, when it was burned, and thrown for dead 
over the bank of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ottawa creek" rel="city">Ottawa Creek</a>,. 

I saw three mangled bodies of three young men, two of which 
were dead and had lain on the open ground for about eighteen hours 
for the flies to work at, the other living with twenty buckshot and 
bullet-holes in him. One of those two dead was my own son. 

Here, then, we may pause to review the position of the 
Brown family in Kansas, twelve months after John Brown 
had set forth from Illinois to support his children in making 
free and peaceful homes on those beautiful prairies. One 
I of his sons was dead ; another a prisoner charged with trea- 
j son ; a third was desperately wounded j a fourth stricken 
; down with illness ; all had lost their cabins, their crops, 
i their books and papers ; their wives and children were scattered or far away. Only one son of the six remained in 
fighting condition ; all were in extreme poverty ; the cause 
of freedom, for which they had ventured so much, seemed 
almost lost. Everything was subdued except the inexorable 
will of John Brown. 1 That remained ; his faith in God and 
his obedience to the voice of God were as quick as ever ; and 
he had begun the warfare against slavery by a dire blow, 
which was destined in its consequences to make Kansas free, 
even as his master-stroke in Virginia, three years later, was 
to set in motion the avalanche that destroyed slavery in the 
whole land. This blow was the execution at Pottawatomie 
on the 24th of May. 

of benevolence and philanthropy : and may God reward you more than double for your 
toil and losses in the work to bring about liberty for all men ! Write me if you can, and 
let me know how you are getting along, etc. 

I remain your sincere friend, JOHN T. JONES.

NORTH ELBA, Dec. 27, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1859">1859</a>. 

DEAR SIR, Your letter to my mother was received to-night. 
You wish me to give you the facts in regard to the Pottawatomie 
execution, or murder, and to know whether my father was a participator in the act. I was one of his company at the time of the homicide, and was never away from him one hour at a time after we took 
up arms in Kansas; therefore I say positively that he was not a 
participator in the deed, although I should think none the less of 
him if he had been there; for it was the grandest thing that was 
ever done in Kansas. It was all that saved the Territory from being 
overrun with drunken land-pirates from the Southern States. That 
was the first act in the history of Kansas which proved to the demon 
of Slavery that there was as much room to give blows as to take 
them. It was done to save life, and to strike terror through their 
wicked ranks. 

Yours respectfully, 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=sab" rel="me">SALMON BROWN</a>.

You can, at any time you think it best, come to camp and see me, 
especially at evening, without observation. Come to the house of 
Mrs. Wesley, about fifty rods east from the camp, and she will send 
up her boy to let me know that a man wants to see me. You could 
no doubt find a temporary stopping-place either at Captain Thome s 
or at Mr. Lewis s, about a mile south of our camp, near the California road. In coming here you will notice two camps ; ours is the 
more easterly. If you wish to see me, come at evening, early, to the 
captain s tent, and say that you wish to see the prisoners, and you 
will be admitted, without a doubt. The captain is very accommodating ; you can come and go incog. The captain of Company I 
says he has been after you more than two months. Don t let them 
get you. I very much want to see you, but don t run any great risk 
on this account. At any time you wish to write me, direct to 
X. Y. Z., and enclose in an envelope to C. W. Babeock, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>. 

Aug. 16, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1856">1856</a>. 

The prospect now appears so favorable for us that it does seem as 
though I had better not try to meet you just now. The prospect is 
that there will be either a writ of habeas corpus issued, or a change 
of venue, which will in either case take us into the States for trial. 
Have sent you several letters lately by persons going to Topeka, and 
I enclose one which I wrote on the 13th. 1 The bearer of it, not 
seeing you there, has returned it. I was in hearing of the attack on 
Colonel Titus this morning. A messenger has just come in, stating 
that he (Titus) and several others were taken prisoners ; Titus 
wounded. He also reports that a Free-State man was either killed yesterday or last night, as he was found at Titus s stiff and cold. I 
saw the fire of Titus s house. Well, it seems that Heaven is 
smiling on our arms. The case may be that within a few days I 
shall think it altogether best to try to meet you. A very few days 
will determine; All well. May God bless you ! Good-by. 

I should be very glad to see you, if you think it prudent to visit 
me. There is nothing here, that I know of, in the way. If you 
come just at edge of evening, no one need know it is you ; but don t^,, 
risk yourself if you are aware of danger. There are spies around. 
In view of present prospects, the prisoners think best that no at 
tempt should be made at present to release them. We are all well 
treated here. Captain Sackett is a noble man. Should be very 
glad to know where I could communicate with you from time to 
time. J. B., JR., in prison.

CAMP OF U. S. CAVALRY, NEAR LECOMPTON, KANSAS, 
Aug. 16, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1856">1856</a>. 

DEAR BROTHER JASON AND OTHERS, Agreeably with my 
promise to write often, I have sent you lately not less than four 
letters, one or two by private hands, the others by mail. Events 
of the most stirring character are now passing within hearing 
distance. I should think more than two hundred shots have been 
fired within the past half hour, arid within a mile of our camp. 
Have just learned that some eighty of our Free-State men have 
11 pitched into " a proslavery camp this side of Lecompton, which 
was commanded by a notorious proslavery scoundrel named Titus, 
one of the Buford party from Alabama. A dense volume of smoke 
is now rising in the vicinity of his house. The firing has ceased, 
and we are most impatient to learn the result. 

During the past month the Ruffians have been actively at work, 
and have made not less than five intrenched camps, where they have 
in different parts of the Territory established themselves in armed bauds, well provided with provisions, arms, and ammunition. From 
these camps they sally out, steal horses, and rob Free-State settlers 
(in several cases murdering them), and then slip back into their 
camp with their plunder. Last week a body of our men made a 
descent upon Franklin, 1 and after a skirmishing fight of about three 
hours took their barracks, and recovered some sixty guns and a 
cannon, of which our men had been robbed some months since, on 
the road from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=westport" rel="city">Westport</a>. Our loss was one man killed and two 
severely wounded, but it is thought they will recover. The enemy 
were in a log building, from which they kept up a sharp fire, while 
they themselves were quite unexposed. Our men then had recourse 
to a system of tactics not laid down in Scott. They procured a 
wagon loaded with hay, and running it down against the building 
set it on fire, when the rascals immediately surrendered. Yesterday 
our men had invested another of their fortified camps on Washington 
Creek, a south branch of the Wakarusa ; and it was expected that 
an attack would be made upon it last night. 

Hurrah for our side ! A messenger has just come in, stating that 
on the approach of our men, some two hundred and fifty or three 
hundred in number, at Washington Creek yesterday, towards even 
ing, the enemy broke and fled, leaving behind, to fall into the hands 
of our men, a lot of provisions and a hundred stand of arms. But 
this is not all. The notorious Colonel Titus, who only a day or two 
since was heard to declare that u Free-State men had only two 
weeks longer to remain in Kansas/ went out last night on a 
marauding expedition, in which he took six prisoners and a lot of 
horses. This morning our men followed him closely and fell upon 
his camp, killed two of his men, liberated the prisoners he had 
taken, took him and ten other prisoners, set fire to his house, and 
with a lot of arms, tents, provisions, etc., returned, having in the 
fight had only one of our men seriously wounded. 

August 19. 

The affair last mentioned was conducted with such expedition that 
the United States troops, located about a mile off, had not time to 
reach the scene before it was all over and our men on their return, 
marching in good order. Our men numbered four hundred, and had the cannon which they had taken at Franklin. With this they fired 
six balls, out of seven shots, through Colonel Titus s house before 
his gang surrendered. This series of victories has caused the greatest 
fear among the proslavery men. While the firing was going on, the 
citizens at Lecompton fled across the river in the greatest consternation. Great numbers are leaving for Missouri. Colonel Titus was 
seriously wounded by a Sharpe s-rifle ball passing through his hand, 
and lodging in his shoulder too deep to be reached. It is thought 
the wound will prove fatal. 

Day before yesterday Governor Shannon and Major Sedgwick of 
the army went to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> to obtain the prisoners our men had 
taken ; but our men would consent to give them up only on condition 
that they on the other side should give up the prisoners that had been 
taken on warrants at Franklin, the next day after the battle there, 
for participating in it ; and, as a further condition, that they should 
give up the cannon which had been taken from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> at the time 
it was sacked ; and still further agree to do all in their power to 
break up the camps of armed desperadoes, as well as to prevent their 
coining in from Missouri. These terms were complied with ; and 
yesterday the prisoners were exchanged and the cannon at Lecompton 
given up to our men, and it is now once more in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>. Thus 
you see they have themselves set their own laws at nought by that 
exchange of prisoners whom they had taken on warrants for those 
we had taken by the might of the people. Lane s men were on hand 
and did good service. The <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">Chicago</a> company that had been turned 
back on the Missouri River were on hand and in the thickest of the 
fight. Some say Colonel Lane was in it himself. Father returned 
with the overland emigrants, leaving in Nebraska Henry Thompson, 
Owen, Salmon, Frederick, and Oliver, much improved in health. 
He was in the fight at Franklin, and also aided in routing the gang 
on Washington Creek, as well as in the capture of Titus and his 
crew. By this time he is in Iowa, or some other distant region. 
He is an omnipresent dread to the ruffians. I see by the Missouri 
papers that they regard him as the most terrible foe they have to 
encounter. He stands very high with the Free- State men who will 
fight ; and the great majority of these have made up their minds that 
nothing short of war to the death can save us from extermination. 
Say to the men of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a> to become thoroughly prepared, for 
at any time their lives may depend upon their efficiency and vigi 
lance ; that military organization is needed for something else than 
amusement. Don t fail to urge the enrolment of every able-bodied 
Free-State man, and place yourselves in a position to act both offensively and defensively in the most efficient manner. Stringfellow 
and Atchison are said to be again raising a force to come in from 
Missouri and carry out their "long-cherished plan to drive out or exterminate our people. If our men are wide awake we shall gain the 
day. The prospect for Kansas becoming a free State never looked brighter. Now is the time to prepare, and continue prepared. 

Have not yet learned of any definite action of Congress in regard to us prisoners, but we doubtless shall in a few days. Wealthy continues to have the chills and fever every few days. Write often. 
Ever your affectionate brother, 

JOHN.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tabor" rel="city">Tabor</a>, FREMONT COUNTY, IOWA, Aug. 27, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1856">1856</a>. 

DEAR MOTHER, The last news we had from Kansas, father was at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, and had charge of a company, the bravest men 
the Territory could afford. Those who come through here from the Territory say that father is the most daring, courageous man in 
Kansas. You have no doubt heard that the Free-State men have taken two forts, or blockhouses, with a fine lot of arms, several 
prisoners, and two cannon. Shannon was obliged to flee for his life ; afterwards came to Lane to negotiate for peace. He proposed that 
the Free-State men should give up the prisoners and arms they 
had taken ; at the same time they (the enemy) should still hold 
our men as prisoners, and keep all the arms they had taken from 
the Free-State men. But Lane would not consent to that ; he 
required Shannon to deliver up the howitzer they had taken at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, release some prisoners, disarm the proslavery men in 
the Territory, and do all in his power to remove the enemy from 
the Territory. With fear and trembling, Shannon consented to 
all of Lane s demands. 

There is now at this place a company of volunteers from Maine, 
Massachusetts, and Michigan, ahout eighty in all. We hear lately 
that about three thousand Missourians have crossed at St. Joe and 
other places, and have gone armed into the Territory; that Governor Woodson has sent four hundred mounted men on to the fron 
tier to intercept our volunteers and prevent them from carrying in 
provisions and ammunition, which are much needed now in Kansas. 
The last information comes from reliable sources, and is probably 
true, a portion of it. We also learn that the Free-State men 
have melted up all the old lead-pipe they can get hold of for ammunition; and now the news comes from reliable sources that Lane is 
about to enter Leavenworth with two thousand men ; that he last sent word to the citizens of Leavenworth, requiring them to deliver 
up a few prisoners they had taken, with some wagons and other 
property, or he will destroy the town forthwith. Colonel Smith, of 
Leavenworth, commander of Government troops, refuses to protect 
the proslavery men of the Territory, replying that Lane is able to 
dress them all out, troops and all. Shannon made a speech to them, 
urging them to cease hostilities, that he could not defend them 
(that is, our enemies). At present our enemies and the Missourians 
are trembling in their boots, if reports are true. 

I have gained strength quite fast, and am now determined to go 
back into the Territory, and try the elephant another pull. We 
hope that men will volunteer by the thousands from the States, well 
armed, with plenty of money to buy provisions with, which are 
scarce in Kansas Territory. There are probably several thousand 
acres less of corn in Kansas than there would have been had it not 
been for the war. We look hard for help : now comes the tug of 
war. We have sent on men to learn the state of affairs on the 
frontier, and will move on into the Territory shortly. We are now 
waiting for one other company, which is within a few days drive 
of here. For the want of time I leave out many particulars in 
connection with the taking of those forts, which would be quite 
interesting, and show Yankee skill and strategy, at least. If any 
of our folks write to us, or to me (I assume another name, George Lyman), direct to George Lyrnan, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tabor" rel="city">Tabor</a>, Fremont County, Iowa, 
care Jonas Jones, Esq. Mr. Jones will take them out of the office 
here and send them on by private conveyance. We cannot hear 
from you in any other way. Perhaps you know of a different way, 
but I do not. 

Your affectionate son, 

OWEN BROWN. 

P. S. Have not heard from Fred since Oliver and William 
Thompson took him into the camp ; nor have I heard from Henry, 
Salmon, William, and Oliver since they left this place to go home.

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, I have one moment 
to write to you, to say that I am yet alive, that Jason and family 
were well yesterday; John and family, I hear, are well (he being 
yet a prisoner). On the morning of the 30th of August an attack 
was made by the Kuffians on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a>, numbering some four 
hundred, by whose scouts our dear Frederick was shot dead without 
warning, he supposing them to be Free-State men, as near as we 
can learn. One other man, a cousin of Mr. Adair, was murdered by 
them about the same time that Frederick was killed, and one badly 
wounded at the same time. At this time I was about three miles 
off, where I had some fourteen or fifteen men over night that I had 
just enlisted to serve under me as regulars. These I collected as 
well as I could, with some twelve or fifteen more ; and in about 
three quarters of an hour I attacked them from a wood with thick 
undergrowth. With this force we threw them into confusion for 
about fifteen or twenty minutes, during which time we killed or 
wounded from seventy to eighty of the enemy, as they say, and then we escaped as well as we could, with one killed while escaping, 
two or three wounded, and as many more missing. Four or five 
Free-State men were butchered during the day in all. Jason fought 
bravely by my side during the fight, and escaped with me, he being 
unhurt. I was struck by a partly-spent grape, canister, or rifle shot, 
which bruised me some, but did not injure me seriously. " Hitherto 
the Lord has helped me," notwithstanding my afflictions. Things 
seem rather quiet just now, but what another hour will bring I can 
not say. I have seen three or four letters from Ruth, and one from Watson, of July or August, which are all I have seen since in June. 
I was very glad to hear once more from you, and hope that you will 
continue to write to some of the friends, so that I may hear from you. 
I am utterly unable to write you for most of the time. May the God 
of our fathers bless and save you all !

Early in the morning of the 30th of August the enemy s scouts 
approached to within one mile and a half of the western boundary of 
the town of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a>. At this place my son Frederick (who was 
not attached to my force) had lodged, with some four other young 
men from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, and a young man named Garrison, from Middle 
Creek. The scouts, led by a proslavery preacher named White, 
shot my son dead in the road, while he as I have since ascertained supposed them to be friendly. At the same time they 
butchered Mr. Garrison, and badly mangled one of the young men 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, who came with my son, leaving him for dead. 
This was not far from sunrise. I had stopped during the night 
about two and one half miles from them, and nearly one mile from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a>. I had no organized force, but only some twelve or 
fifteen new recruits, who were ordered to leave their preparations for 
breakfast and follow me into the town, as soon as this news was 
brought to me. 

As I had no means of learning correctly the force of the enemy, 
I placed twelve of the recruits in a log-house, hoping we might be 
able to defend the town. I then gathered some fifteen more men 
together, whom we armed with guns; and we started in the direction of the enemy. After going a few rods we could see them 
approaching the town in line of battle, about half a mile off, upon 
a hill west of the village. I then gave up all idea of doing more 
than to annoy, from the timber near the town, into which we 
were all retreated, and which was filled with a thick growth of 
underbrush ; but I had no time to recall the twelve men in the log- 
house, and so lost their assistance in the fight. At the point above 
named I met with Captain Cline, a very active young man, who 
had w r ith him some twelve or fifteen mounted men, and persuaded 
him to go with us into the timber, on the southern shore of the 
Osage, or Marais des Cygnes, a little to the northwest from the 
village. Here the men, numbering not more than thirty in all, 
were directed to scatter and secrete themselves as well as they could, 
and await the approach of the enemy. This was done in full view 
of them (who must have seen the whole movement), and had to be 
done in the utmost haste. I believe Captain Cline and some of his 
men were not even dismounted in the fight, but cannot assert positively. When the left wing of the enemy had approached to within 
common rifle-shot, we commenced firing, and very soon threw the 
northern branch of the enemy s line into disorder. This continued 
some fifteen or twenty minutes, which gave us an uncommon opportunity to annoy them. Captain Cline and his men soon got out of 
ammunition, and retired across the river. 

After the enemy rallied we kept up our fire, until, by the leaving 
of one and another, we had but six or seven left. We then retired 
across the river. We had one man killed a Mr. Powers, from 
Captain Cline s company in the fight. One of my men, a Mr. Partridge, was shot in crossing the river. Two or three of the 
party who took part in the fight are yet missing, and may be lost or 
taken prisoners. Two were wounded ; namely, Dr. Updegraff and a 
Mr. Collis. I cannot speak in too high terms of them, and of many others I have not now time to mention. 

One of my best men, together with myself, was struck by a partially spent ball from the enemy, in the commencement of the fight, 
but we were only bruised. The loss I refer to is one of my missing 
men. The loss of the enemy, as we learn by the different statements of our own as well as their people, was some thirty-one or 
two killed, and from forty to fifty wounded. After burning the 
town to ashes and killing a Mr. Williams they had taken, whom 
neither party claimed, they took a hasty leave, carrying their dead 
and wounded with them. .They did not attempt to cross the river, 
nor to search for us, and have not since returned to look over their 
work. 

I give this in great haste, in the midst of constant interruptions. 
My second son was with me in the fight, and escaped unharmed. 

This I mention for the benefit of his friends. Old Preacher White, 
I hear, boasts of having killed my son. Of course he is a liar.

MONDAY MORNING, Sept. 8, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1856">1856</a>. 

DEAR FATHER AND BROTHER, Colonel Blood has just handed 
me your letter, for which I am most grateful. Having before heard 
of Frederick s death and that you were missing, my anxiety on your 
account has been most intense. Though my dear brother I shall 
never again see here, yet I thank God you and Jason still live. Poor 
Frederick has perished in a good cause, the success of which cause I 
trust will yet bring joy to millions. 

My " circumstances and prospects" are much the same as when I 
last wrote you. The trial of Mr. Williams and me is before Cato, in 
October, I believe the 4th. Don t know whether or not the others 
will get any trial here. Judge Lecompte is reported sick, and as no 
notice of the names of the jurors and witnesses has been served on 
them, it looks as if the intention is to hold them over to another 
term. 

Wealthy has the chills and fever almost every day. She succeeds 
in checking it, only a short time. It would afford us a great satisfaction to see you and Jason; he, and I have no doubt you, could come 
up with some one without any risk. If Governor Geary should not 
release us, I still think of going with you, whenever you think it best, 
to some place out of reach of a re-arrest. I can, I have no doubt, 
succeed in making my escape to you from here, where W. and Johnny 

old poetic name ; and here, too, on this "Marsh of the Swans," the 
vulture of slavery croaked its foulest note before committing suicide. A 
long, slow, winding, and sombre stream, fringed everywhere with dark 
woods, it creeps through the counties south of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, where the worst 
ruffians had their roosts, and where the darkest deeds were done. The 
annals of theft and murder and arson on the Scotch border, around which 
Walter Scott and the older ballad-makers cast an atmosphere of romance, 
were repeated in ruder ways in these Missouri Marches, of which John 
Brown and James Montgomery carne to be the self-appointed wardens. 
Montgomery was himself a Scotchman by descent, whose great-grandfather 
had fought for the young Chevalier at Ctilloden ; but Brown was of the un 
mixed Puritan breed, and inherited from deacons and captains of Connecticut " the sword of the Lord and of Gideon." Montgomery s widow and sons still live in Kansas, but none of the Browns remain there alive. might join us. There is some talk of our being removed to Leaven- 
worth soon. If we are, I suppose the difficulty of escape would be 
very much increased. I am anxious to see you both, in order to perfect some plan of escape in case it should appear best. Come up if 
you consistently can. 

The battle of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a> is considered here as the great fight so 
far, and, considering the enemy s loss, it is certainly a great victory 
for us. Certainly a very dear burning of the town for them. This 
has proven most unmistakably that u Yankees " will "fight." 
Every one I hear speaking of you is loud in your praise. The 
Missourians in this region show signs of great fear. Colonel Cook l 
was heard to say that if our party were prudent in view of their success, there was nothing to prevent our having everything our own 
way. 

Hoping to see you both soon, I am as ever 

. Your affectionate son and brother.

The state of affairs immediately preceding the fight was 
made known by many letters such as the following, written 
by a Kansas farmer, Cyrus Adams, who emigrated from 
Massachusetts, to his brother at home : 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, KANSAS, Aug. 24, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1856">1856</a>. 

DEAR BROTHER, You probably learn of the state of affairs here 
in Kansas as well as T can describe them. We live under a republican form of government, so called, a form of government which 
allows its people to be murdered every day, and lifts no hand for 
their protection ; and so we are all of us liable to be murdered any 
day. Every little while we are set upon by bands of ruffians acting 
under the officers of the General Government ; towns are sacked and 
burned, men murdered, and property destroyed. Until lately the 
Free-State folks have not offered much resistance to these outrages. 

It was known that bands of these ruffians encamped in the vicinity, 
where they carried on their trade of horse-stealing and robbery ; and 
murdered a man with whom I was well acquainted : he was riding 
by near one of these camps, and was shot dead by some of the guard. 
His name was Major Hoyt, of Deerfield, Mass. Another man was 
shot near the same place. A few days ago a brother-in-law of Mr. Nute, whom you saw in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=concord" rel="city">Concord</a> came into the Territory. He in 
tended to stop in Leavenworth. He brought his wife, and left her 
with Mr. Nute until he could go back .and put up a house. When returniug, and within two miles of Leavenworth, he was shot, and, 
horrible to relate, was scalped in the Indian fashion. A man or 
a beast took his scalp and carried it about the streets of Leaven- 
worth on a long pole, saying that he " went out to get a damned 
Abolition scalp, and got one." Another man went to Kansas City 
for a load of lumber ; he was shot and scalped in the same way. So 
you may judge of the folks we have to deal with. If they catch a 
man alone they show no mercy.

CAPTAIN <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">JOHN BROWN</a>. 

DEAR SIR, Governor Geary has been here and talks very well. 
He promises to protect us, etc. There will be no attempt to arrest 
any one for a few days, and I think no attempt to arrest you is 
contemplated by him. He talks of letting the past be forgotten, 
so far as may be, and of commencing anew. If convenient, can you 
not come to town and see us ? l I will then tell you all that the 
governor said, and talk of some other matters. 
Very respectfully, 

C. ROBINSON.

John Brown, Jr., to his Father. 

All seem to be pleased with Geary. They think that while he 
must talk of enforcing the Territorial laws, he has intended to let 
them lie a dead letter ; says no Territorial officer or court shall arrest 
or try. Although he says in his proclamation that all armed men 
must disband, yet he says our men better hold together a few days 
until he can clear the Territory of the militia ; requests our men to 
enroll themselves, choose their own officers, and consider him as chief 
and themselves as his guard. I am inclined to the belief that unless 
something unusual shall turn up within a few days, you had better 
return home, as I have no doubt an attempt will be made to arrest 
you, as well as Lane, whom Geary says he is under obligations to ar 
rest. His plan, no doubt, will be to get the assistance of Free-State 
men to aid in making arrests. Don t allow yourself to be trapped 
in that way. Captain Walker thinks of going East via Nebraska 
soon. I do hope you will go with him, for I am sure that you will 
be no more likely to be let alone than Lane. Don t go into that 
secret military refugee plan as talked of by Robinson, I beg of you. 
I shall go into Mr. Whitman s house, about two and a half miles west 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, where I shall make arrangements for Jason and commence cutting hay.

the killed at the battle of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a> is incorrect. Your course,

my heartfelt thanks for your prompt, efficient, and timely action 
against the invaders of our rights and the murderers of our citizens. History will give your name a proud place on her pages,

[With this preliminary explanation, I may now give some 
correspondence of these committees with Brown and others, 
beginning with a letter sent by the Massachusetts Kansas 
Committee, before they saw Brown, to the late Senator 
Grimes, of Iowa, then Governor of that State. ]

STATE KANSAS AID COMMITTEE ROOMS, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, Dec. 20, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1856">1856</a>. 

DEAR SIR, Your letter of the 16th has been received, and we 
are glad to find that the importance of State action in regard to Kan 
sas is appreciated in Iowa as well as here. The first question seems 
to be, Is such action really needed ? And I will state what I believe 
to be substantially the views of this committee, who are now labor 
ing to obtain an appropriation from our legislature. 

There can be no doubt that the measures of which you speak (the 
purchase of land, erection of mills, etc.) could not well be engaged in 
by a State ; and certainly no grant for that purpose could be obtained 
here. But although present destitution may be relieved in Kansas, 
it is by no means certain that there will not be great suffering there 
in the spring, before any crops can be raised, especially if for any 
cause business should not be active. Then who can be sure that the 
scenes of last summer will not be acted again ? True, things look 
better ; but the experience of the past ought to teach us to prepare 
for the future. But even if things go on prosperously there, money 
may still be needed. Men have been subjected to unjust punishments, or at least threatened with them, under the unconstitutional laws of the Territory. It is desirable that these cases should be brought before a higher tribunal ; while the accused person may 
be a poor man unable to bear the expense of such a suit. The State appropriations could then be drawn upon for this purpose, and used 
to retain counsel, furnish evidence, and in other ways to forward the suit of the injured man. 

Would it not therefore be well for each State to make an appropriation, which should remain in the hands of the Governor, as in 
Vermont, or of a committee, until it should be needed in Kansas ? 
It would thus be a contingent fund, to be drawn on only in cases of 
necessity, and it would be ready against any emergency. It might 
never be called for, or only a portion of it might be used; but should 
occasion arise, it would save our citizens in Kansas from many of the 
horrors which have afflicted them the past year. A bill embodying 
these ideas will be introduced into our legislature; and from the 
tone of our people we have good hope that it will pass. If a similar 
bill could pass your legislature I have no doubt the example would 
be followed by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, Maine, Michigan, Connecticut, and per 
haps by Ohio, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. A general 
movement of this kind would give us all we want ; and we might 
make Kansas free, I think, without expending a dollar of the money 
voted. The moral effect of such action on emigration from the North, 
and on the employment of capital, would be very important. Security would be given that the rights of emigrants would be supported ; 
and the first result would be the emigration of thousands as soon as 
spring opens; so that by July we should have a force of Northern 
settlers there, enough to sustain any form of law which might be set 
up. Without this, I fear that next year, in spite of the flattering 
promises of the present, will only see the last year s history repeated. 
There will be no confidence in the tranquillity of the Territory; 
capital will shun it ; emigration be almost stopped ; and a year hence 
we may be no better off than now, and perhaps worse. With these 
opinions, we look on State appropriations as the salvation of Kansas, 
and hope that the whole North may be led to the same view. 
With much respect, 

F. B. SANBORN, 

Corresponding Secretary of State Committee.

current. We therefore wish you to inform yourself as fully as possible of all their operations from the commencement to the present

give a full and close account to us, and also before our legislature, 
should you be called upon for that purpose. We want to know the

DEAR SIR, Yours of the 10th was received to-day, and the 
arrangement which you have made with regard to the money will 
no doubt be satisfactory. I am sorry to say, however, that our 
committee are not satisfied with the infrequent and irregular communication which exists between us and you. It is now more than 
four months since our committee has been expecting and hoping for 
an account of the money we have sent you, . . . and yet we can 
get no definite information as to the way in which your agents have 
expended our money ; nor have we had from time to time much 
knowledge of the general course of your operations. You say that 
you have no time for such communications; but certainly a committee like ours, representing so many people and so much money, 
ought to take precedence in a correspondence with individuals. 
Such information as we seek is absolutely necessary to our acting in 
concert with you ; and for want of it we are now compelled to act 
by ourselves. In order to satisfy the committee and our contributors as to what has been done, it is necessary that we should have 
copies of your accounts, so far, at least, as they relate to our 
money ; and therefore we ask for the copy mentioned in the indorsed 
vote. And I am further directed to request that you Mill give our 
agent, Mr. E. B. Whitman, such information on this point as he may 
desire. ... All that our committee wish is a full and business-like 
statement of what you have done and are doing ; for want of this 
they are compelled to cease acting as collectors of money for which 
they can obtain no sufficient vouchers.

DEAR Sm, I am unable yet to give you the schedule of articles 
which the committee propose placing in your hands. Please address 
rne at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">Chicago</a>, stating whether a letter may be still sent to you at 
the Massasoit House. It will be necessary for me to examine ship 
ping-books, etc., in our office at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">Chicago</a>. I brought your matters 
before the notice of the committee yesterday. Resolutions were 
passed directing the secretary to instruct Mr. Jones, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tabor" rel="city">Tabor</a>, to 
retain the supplies, etc., in his hands until you had made your 
selections. Resolutions were also adopted empowering me to ship 
clothing, boots, etc., to you at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tabor" rel="city">Tabor</a>, which will be done on the 
opening of navigation.. Very truly, 

HORACE WHITE.

MY DEAR SIR, The articles specified in the schedule and order 
which you gave me in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> will be forwarded next week. I 
think we shall be able to make out the whole number required,

freight paid through. Mr. Jones has been notified to expect them. 
We hope to hear from you soon.

CAPTAIN <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">JOHN BROWN</a>. 

MY DEAR FRIEND, I find it quite impossible to prepare a schedule of the property which belongs to you under the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> resolution. It can only be ascertained in the Territory. I am going 
there myself about the first of next month, and I need not say that 
you may command my services at all times. Mr. Arny is there, and 
with the help of him and Mr. Whitman we shall probably be able 
to secure everything. At any rate we will work for it. Please let 
me hear how you are prospering. Write me a line directed to Chicago. If I am not here it will be forwarded to me. State when you 
expect to be in Kansas. If you should think it undesirable to have 
one of your letters sent through Missouri, you need not sign your 
name to it. I shall know the handwriting. I anticipate perilous 
times ; and when the Philistines are upon us, I may possibly be found 
carrying a bayonet on the right side. 

Very truly, 

HORACE WHITE. 

P. S. I suppose the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> people will fix you out with a return 
ticket. Perhaps it may not be amiss to send you the enclosed note. 
If you have other means of procuring just as well a free ticket, I 
would prefer you would not use this, because the railroads have done 
very liberally by us, and I do not wish to seem to be bleeding them. 

I would rather no one but yourself should have the benefit of the enclosed, because our credit with the companies for the future depends 
somewhat upon the fairness which they experience this summer. 
Again very truly, 

H. W.

DEAR SIR, I last week packed fourteen boxes clothing for you,

Captain John Brown, of Kansas Territory, is commended to ine 
by a highly reputable citizen of this State as a gentleman every way 
worthy of entire confidence. I have also seen a letter from Governor 
Charles Robinson, whose handwriting I recognize, speaking of Captain Brown and his services to the cause of the Free-State men in 
Kansas in terms of the warmest commendation. Upon these testimonials I cordially recommend him to the confidence and regard of 
all who desire to see Kansas a free State.

MY DEAR SIR, Captain John Brown lately wrote me, requesting that I put a subscription paper in aid of the cause of freedom in Kansas in the hands of some reliable and efficient person here. I am sorry to say that on consideration I do not find there is any probability of obtaining any contributions here beyond the twenty-five dollars which 
I obtained for the Captain when here early last winter. The capital of a State, where 
calls are so constant and must have attention, is a hard place to raise money ; and 
there are very few indeed who can be brought to see that the cause of freedom in Kansas 
at this time requires further contributions. I write this note to you at the request of 
Captain Brown, who speaks of you as his special friend. 

Very respectfully and truly, 

S. P. CHASE.

CAPTAIN BROWN. 

DEAR SIR, Learning that there is a messenger in town from 
you, I will take the opportunity to drop you a line. We are just 
through with the October election, and as far as this county is concerned it went off bright. This was owing in a great measure to 
our thorough military organization here, and the well-known reputation that our boys have for fighting. There were about four 
hundred and twenty-five votes cast in this county : about three hundred and fifty Free-State. I have a company organized here of 
about eighty men, and we drilled twice a week for several weeks 
previous to election, which no doubt had a wholesome effect upon 
the borderers. Our company is a permanent institution. We have 
sent on to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a> for three drums and two fifes. We are very poorly supplied with arms. However, I understand that you have 
some arms with you which you intend to bring into the Territory. 
I hope that you will not forget the boys here, a considerable number 
of whom have smelt gunpowder, and have had their courage tried on 
several occasions. I do not like to boast, but I think we have some 
of the best fighting stock here that there is in the Territory. Speak 
ing of arms reminds me that there was a box containing five dozen 
revolvers sent to you at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> last fall to be distributed by you to 
your boys. K. and W. two renegade Free-State men from here 
went up to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> about that time, told a pitiful tale, and said 
that they were your boys ; and the committee that had the revolvers 
in charge gave them each one, and a Sharpe s rifle. A few days after, 
I was in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, and applied to the committee to know if they 
intended to distribute the revolvers; if they did, that I would like to 
have one. They refused, however, to let me have one, because for 
sooth I could not tell as big a yarn about what I had done for the 
Free- State cause as K. and W. could. I have since learned that 
the committee have distributed the revolvers to the "Stubs" and 
others about <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, with the understanding that they are to 
return them at your order. But I think it is doubtful if you get 
them. There has been plenty of Sharpe s rifles and other arms distributed at Manhattan and other points remote from the Border, 
where they never have any disturbances, and a Border Ruffian is a 
curiosity ; while along the Border here, where we are liable to 
have an outbreak at any time, we have had no arms distributed 
at all. 

Two or three weeks before election I visited the Border counties 
south of this, and organized a company of one hundred men on the 
Little Osage, and a company on Sugar Creek ; also at Stanton and 
on the Pottawatomie above this point. According to the election 
returns, we have done much better in this and the Border counties 
south than they have in the Border counties north of this point. 
The boys would like to see you and shake you by the hand once 
more. Nearly all would unite in welcoming you back here; those 
that would not, you have nothing to fear from in this locality. The 
sentiment of the people and the strength and energy of the Free- 
State party here exercise a wholesome restraint upon those having 
Border Ruffian proclivities. 

Yours as of old for the right, 

HENRY H. WiLLiAMS.

OFFICE NATIONAL KANSAS COMMITTEE, 

11 MARINE BANK BUILDING, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">Chicago</a>, April 1, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1857">1857</a>. 

CAPTAIN JOHN BROWN, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a>, Mass. 

At a meeting of the National Kansas Committee, held this day, it 
was 

Resolved, That as according- to the present state of the public 
feeling, evinced by the almost total cessation of contributions to 
the funds of the committee, it appears that the means of carrying on 
our operations will not be forthcoming from the usual sources ; there 
fore, it is expedient to take immediate measures to settle the liabili 
ties, and close the accounts of the committee, and to reduce the 
current expenses to the lowest possible point ; and that the secretary 
be instructed to take measures accordingly. 

Resolved, further, That the secretary be instructed to write to the 
members of the committee residing in other cities, to Messrs. Greeley & McElrath, Hon. Gerrit Smith, and other prominent donors 
and friends, setting forth the fact of the cessation of contributions 
as above stated, and the necessity we are under of closing our operations, unless immediately sustained by liberal contributions. 

We are sorry to be obliged to come to the above conclusion, but 
are compelled to do so. There are several important undertakings 
now in hand, which we shall have to abandon, unless further means 
are forthcoming. The committee are at present out of money, and 
are compelled to decline sending you the five hundred dollars you 
speak of. They are sorry this has become the case, but it was un 
avoidable. I need not state to you all the reasons why. The country 
has stopped sending us contributions, and we have no means of replenishing our treasury. We shall need to have aid from some 
quarter to enable us to meet our present engagements. 

I send you a copy of the list of articles selected for you by Mr. Arny. Our opinion is that some things have been selected that you 
do not need; such, for instance, as quilts, unless it is intended to 
supply the families of the company, and mits, which I suppose means 
ladies mits. If he means mittens they would be useful. 1 
Yours, etc., 

H. B. HURD.

STATE KANSAS AID COMMITTEE ROOM, 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, Jan. 7, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1857">1857</a>. 

Received of George L. Stearns, Chairman of the Massachusetts 
Kansas Aid Committee, an order on Edward Clark, Esq., of Lawrence, K. T., for two hundred Sharpe s rifles, carbines, with four 
thousand ball cartridges, thirty-one thousand military caps, and six 
iron ladles, the same to be delivered to said committee, or to their 
order, on demand. It being further understood and agreed that I 
(am at liberty to distribute one hundred of the carbines, and to use 
the ammunition for maintaining the cause of freedom in Kansas and 
in the United States, and that such distribution and use shall be considered a delivery to said committee). [Have authority to use one 
hundred of the carbines, and all the ammunition, as I may think the 
interests of Kansas require. Keeping an account of rny doings] } 
and that such delivery and use shall be considered as such delivery. 1 

A week later I wrote to Edward Clark, another agent of 
our committee (Jan. 15, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1857">1857</a>) : 

" We have made the rifles subject to Captain Brown s order, as we 
wrote you. From Mr. Winchell s account, we conclude that you will 
find them in the Territory, and in the hands of the Central Commit 
tee. 2 In the quarrel between the National and the Central Committees, we hope you will keep yourself strictly neutral, and inform us 
how the case really stands. We hear charges of misconduct from both sides. The order of Captain Brown will not probably be issued till 
spring, if it is at all, since his use of the rifles depends on a contingency 
which may not occur." 

On Jan. 30, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1857">1857</a>, still later instructions followed to Mr. Clark: 

"The National Committee, at their meeting in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, voted 
to resign all claim to the rifles at Tabor to our committee j and Mr. Hurd is to notify you of the fact officially. If, therefore, you have 
commenced any proceedings to get possession of them from the 
National Committee, you may suspend all action until you receive 
Mr. Kurd s letter, which will give you full power in the premises. 
We learn that the rifles are at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tabor" rel="city">Tabor</a>, in charge of a certain Jonas 
Jones, and that they are properly stored and cared for. If this 
should not be so, or if the Central Committee at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a> have 
interfered with them at all, you may take measures to get immediate 
possession, as directed by us. All matters at issue between our 
committee and the National Committee have been satisfactorily 
settled, and we trust there will be no further misunderstandings. 
Mr. Hurd has been in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> and arranged all things. We have 
been expecting a letter from you for some days. By the time this 
reaches you, you will have been at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tabor" rel="city">Tabor</a>, we presume. There 
write us a full account of your proceedings, and also of the present 
condition of things in Kansas, the position of the Central Committee, 
etc. Much business was done at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> meeting ; but no 
final settlement of accounts could be made, by reason of the absence 
of important persons and papers. Conway and Whitman are here, 
preparing to appear before the legislative committee about a State 
appropriation." 

The closing sentence of this letter indicates that the 
Massachusetts Committee, in furtherance of the policy explained to Governor Grimes, was preparing to obtain a 
State appropriation from the legislature which was then 
in "session at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. John Brown was summoned as 
a witness before this legislature, and gave his testimony 
in the hall of the House of Representatives, February 
18, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1857">1857</a>, the committee on Federal Relations holding a 
hearing in that place for the purpose. There are but 
few letters from Brown at this time. Here is one of 
them :

DEAR BROTHER AND SISTER ADAIR, It is a long time since I 
have heard a word from you, but I suppose it is because I have been 
continually shifting about since my return to the States. I am 
getting quite anxious to hear from you, and to get your views on 
your own prospects and present condition, together with your ideas 
of Governor Geary and of Kansas matters generally. I have not 
heard a word from Hudson or <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a> since December ; but that is 
owing to the fact that I have had no place fixed upon, till of late, 
where to receive letters. This has been from a kind of necessity ; 
but I can now say, do write me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a>, Mass., care of the 
Massasoit House, leaving the title of Captain off. I now expect to 
go to Kansas (quietly) before long ; but I do not wish it noised 
about at all. Can you tell me what has become of Captain Holmes 
of your place ? I expect to appear before a committee of the Massachusetts legislature in a day or two. My family were well about a 
week ago. Your affectionate brother,

MY DEAR SIR, Enclosed you will find seventy dollars. Please 
write to John Conant, of East Jaffrey, N. H., and acknowledge receipt ; or write to me saying you have received the Jaffrey money, 
and I will send your letter to them. It is for your own personal use, 
and not for the cause in any other way than that. I am sorry not to 
have seen you before you left. It may not be amiss to say that you 
may find yourself disappointed if you rely on the National Kansas 
Committee for any considerable amount of money. Please to consider this as confidential ; and it is only my own opinion, without 
definite knowledge of their operations. I hope they will get a great deal of money, but think they will not. The old managers have 
not inspired confidence, and therefore money will be hard for them 
to get now and hereafter. This check, you will see, needs your indorsement.

MY DEAR SIR, Your letter from New Haven is received. I 
have just sent to Kansas near fourteen thousand dollars to establish 
a fund to be used, first, to secure the best system of common schools 
for Kansas that exists in this country ; second, to establish Sunday- 
schools. 

The property is held by two trustees in Kansas, and cannot return 
to me. On this account, and because I am always short of money, 
I have not the cash to use for the purpose you name. But in case 
anything should occur, while you are engaged in a great and good

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN ALL, I have just got a letter from 
John. All middling well, March 2, but Johnny, who has the ague 
by turns. I now enclose another from Owen. I sent you some 
papers last week. Have just been speaking for three nights at Can 
ton, Conn., and at Collinsville, a village of that town. At the two 
places they gave me eighty dollars. Canton is where both father 
and mother were raised. They have agreed to send to my family at 
North Elba grandfather John Brown s old granite monument, about 
eighty years old, to be faced and inscribed in memory of our poor 
Frederick, who sleeps in Kansas. 1 I prize it very highly, and the 
family all will, I think. I want to see you all very much, but can 
not tell when I can go back yet. Hope to get something from you 
here soon. Direct as before. May God bless you all ! 
Your affectionate husband and father. 

Mr. Bust, to whom the next letters were written, says 
that he had a " store " at Collinsville in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1857">1857</a>, and John 
Brown was there in April, showing to various persons the 
bowie-knife that he captured with Pate in Kansas. As he 
did so, Brown said : " Such a blade as this, mounted upon a 
strong shaft, or handle, would make a cheap and effective 
weapon. Our friends in Kansas are without arms or money to get them ; and if I could put such weapons into their 
hands, they could make them very useful. A resolute woman, with such a pike, could defend her cabin door against 
man or beast. What can such a weapon be made for ? " Mr. Rust guessed for a dollar each, in quantity. " Very well," 
said Brown ; " I would be glad to pay that price for a 
thousand ; " and it was agreed that Mr. Rust should try to 
get them made in Collins ville for that price, by Charles 
Blair. Mr. Rust further says : 

" During one of his visits I earned him to Canton to see his 
relatives. Not far from their house he noticed a tombstone leaning 
against the stone wall by the roadside. He got out and examined it, 
and found it to be his grandfather s ; whereupon he said, I will go 
back and see if my cousins will let me have it. They consented,

address at North Elba. That stone/ said he, formerly marked 
the grave of my grandfather, who died fighting for the liberties of 
his country ; my son has just been murdered in the same cause in 
Kansas, and the Government applauded the murderer. This stone

MY DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 9th is received. Please for 
ward to me by express the pistols you have received, and also send 
me with them the amount you had to pay on the whole package. Be 
kind enough to say to my friend Blair that I expect funds within a 
day or two to meet my engagement, and that I mean to call on him. 
Please direct the package to John (not Captain) Brown, care Massasoit House, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a>, Mass. Did you receive the package for Selden H. Brown ?

The sabre you got is the identical one taken from Lieutenant Brocket at Black Jack surrender. I would on no account have you

MR. BROWN. 

DEAR SIR, I received yours in relation to the funds which you 
expected from the Kansas Committee, and I would say that I have 
not taken any further measures with the spears than to ascertain 
where I can get the handles and ferules, etc. If you do not find it 
convenient to raise the funds for a thousand, I will make you five 
hundred at the same rate. I should think the committee were not 
treating you very fairly by not honoring your drafts after the promise 
they had made you. I shall wait further orders from you before I 
proceed further. 

Truly yours, 

CHARLES BLAIR.

COLLINSVILLE, CONN., Aug. 27, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1857">1857</a>. 
MR. BROWN. 

DEAR SIR, Yours of the 14th instant carne to hand last Saturday. In regard to those articles, I have to say that I commenced the 
whole number ; have all the handles well seasoned, the ferules and 
guards, screws, etc., and have some over five hundred of them ground, 
but not hearing anything further from you, I have let them rest until 
such times as you can make your arrangements. I thought I would 
not make any further outlay upon them, at least until I heard from you. 
I did not know but things would take such a turn in Kansas that they 
would not be needed. Of this you can judge better than I can. I 
did not feel able to bear the loss of having them left on my hands 
after I had finished them up, as you are aware that we did not expect 
much profit on the manufacture of the articles; but I am not disposed 
to cast the least blame upon you. I very well know that when a man 
is depending upon the public for money he is very liable to be disap 
pointed, and I judge from the tenor of your letter that you will not 
blame me for stopping them, as I had used up the funds. I therefore 
wait your further orders whether to finish them up or to let them rest 
where they are. Don t give yourself any uneasiness about the affair, 
for if I go no further with them, I shall lose nothing, or but little ; 
and I have no doubt you and I can make the matter satisfactory in 
some way. Your son (Oliver) is in the village, but is not now at 
work for me. My work in the shop was too hard for him in the hot 
weather, and he has been out at haying. I think he may get some 
job in the shop soon. Let me hear from you when convenient. 
Very respectfully yours, 

CHARLES BLAIR.

your favor of the 16th. I am glad you had a good meeting at Con

FRIEND BROWN, I have seen some of our friends to-day, and 
they say you had better come here next Monday. There is to be an 
antislavery meeting in the evening, and I think it will be a very good

WORCESTER, March 30, ^85 7. 

CAPTAIN BROWN, I have received your letter from Easton, 
Perm. Some of the men engaged in the Virginia scheme care 
nothing for slavery or antislavery but to make money. Of course 
such will do nothing for Kansas ; but most of us have been doing, 
and shall continue to do, till the thing is settled. We have not 
the remotest idea of relinquishing Kansas, not at all. I have 
just seen Mr. Higgiuson, and he informs me that our county commit 
tee will let you have fifty dollars. Perhaps, also, something will be 
raised by subscription, I gave the papers to Mr. Higginson. He 
will write to you. Please let me know when you are coming this 
way. Do not pay postage on your letter to me, let Uncle Sam do 
his part. Truly yours,

MY DEAR SIR, I am advised that one of " Uncle Sam s hounds

track get cold. I have no idea of being taken, and intend (if God 
will) to go back with irons in rather than upon my hands. Now, my

one or two navy-sized revolvers as soon as may be, together with his 
best cash terms (he warranting them) by the hundred with good 
moulds, flasks, etc. I wish the sample pistols sent to John (not 
Captain) Brown, care of Massasoit House, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=springfield" rel="city">SPRINGFIELD</a>, Mass. I now 
enclose twenty dollars towards repairs done for me and revolvers ; the 
balance I will send as soon as I get the bill. I have written to have 
Dr. Howe send you by express a rifle and two pistols, which with the 
guns you gave me and fixings, together with the rifle given me by 
Mr. Allen & Co. , I wish them to pack in a suitable strong box, perfectly safe, directing to J. B., care of Orson M. Oviatt, Esq., Cleve

Dr. Howe. I got a fine list in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> the other day, and hope Worcester will not be entirely behind. I do not mean you or Mr. Allen & Co.

FRIEND BROWN, I have received your letter containing twenty 
dollars, and have given it over with contents to Allen & Wheelock, 
who will attend to your requests. I shall leave to-night for New 
York City, and may not be back again to look after the things. Please 
send any directions you wish to Allen & Wheelock. The <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> 
people have done nobly, especially Mr. Stearns. Dr. Howe has not 
forwarded the articles named in your letter. As soon as received, I 
will place them in the hands of Allen & Wheelock. I thought it 
best to give them your letters, so that they might attend to your re 
quests understandingly. They will be secret. 

Will you allow me to suggest a name for your company ? I should 
call them " the Neighbors," from Luke, tenth chapter: "Which thinkest thou was neighbor to him who fell among thieves ? " 

Our Virginia scheme is gaining strength wonderfully. 1 Every 
mail brings me offers of laud and men. The press universally favors 
it, that is, so far as we care for favor. It is bound to go ahead. 
You must have a home in Western Virginia.

get them ready, if we can know where to send them, and would then 
be glad to supply you with what you may want. We have got the

" Mr. Brown told me that Mr. Forbes might draw upon me for six 
hundred dollars ; that was about the 1st of April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1857">1857</a> ; these drafts 
soon afterwards came on, and I paid them. Brown furnished me, I

The fish had swallowed the golden hook, but it was not 
easy to " land " him. He should have followed Brown to 
the West in May, but he loitered in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and Brown

1 SIR, If you have drawn on W. H. D. Callender, Esq., cashier at

are not prepared to come on and join me at once, you will please pay over to 
Joseph Bryant, Esq., who is my agent, six hundred dollars, or whatever 
amount you have so drawn.

MY DEAR FRIEND BROWN, I have been anxiously expecting to 
hear from you direct, but have only heard through Mr. Wattles. I 
want to see you as soon as possibly after you arrive in the Territory. 

I have settled at Emporia, six miles above the junction of the Neosho and the Cottonwood. My address is either Emporia or <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, as you may choose. My letters all come and go safe. War, ere 
six months shall have passed away, is inevitable. Secretary Stanton 
has made a public speech in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, and says that those laws (the 
bogus) shall be enforced, and that the taxes shall be paid. The people shout, " Never ! " " Then," he says, " there is war between you 
and me, war to the knife, and the knife to the hilt." There will be no voting ; no paying of taxes ; and I think the Free- State men will 
remove the Territorial Government and set up their own. Then we want you. Please write. All your friends, as far as I know, are well. Very truly yours, 

JAMES H. HOLMES.

to " back down n by the Free- State men, other than by the speculators ; and they are, as a class, never to be relied on, of course. I 
have full faith in the virtue of the Free-State men of Kansas. You have something to learn in the political world here. 

You will hear of me either at Lawrence, through J. E. Cook, of the 
firm of Bacon, Cook, & Co., or I may be at Emporia, where I have 
taken a claim and make it my home. At any rate, Cook can tell 
you where I may be. A case has recently occurred of kidnapping a 
Free-State man, which is this : Archibald Kandell, a young fellow 
who came in with Redpath under Eldridge, last fall, and has been 
all winter on a claim near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a>, was some two weeks since 
enticed out under pretence of trading horses, by four men, and 
abducted into Missouri. Archy was in my company, and is a good brave fellow. How long he is to remain incarcerated and in chains I 
will not in this place and time attempt to predict. 

Judge Conway is here, radical and right. Dr. Robinson recently 
made a proposition with some leading proslavery men to compromise. The Eree-State men won t do it. We are talking of running 
Phillips for governor next fall. 

Very truly your constant friend, 

JAMES.

MY DEAR SIR, I write to say that I started for Kansas some 
three weeks or more since, but have been obliged to stop for the 
fever and ague. I am now righting up, and expect to be on my way 
again soon. Free-State men need have no fear of my desertion. 
There are some half-dozen men I want a visit from at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tabor" rel="city">Tabor</a>, Iowa, 
to come off in the most QUIET WAY ; namely, Daniel Foster, late of

David, on Little <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ottawa creek" rel="city">Ottawa Creek</a>, ; a Mr. Cochran, on Pottawatomie

Wright, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a> ; or William Phillips, or CONWAY, or your 
honor. I have some very important matters to confer with some of 
you about. Let there be no words about it. Should any of you come 
out to see me, wait at Tabor if you get there first. Mr. Adair, at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a>, may supply fifty dollars (if need be) for expenses, on

DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 3d instant was duly received. I 
am much pleased to hear from you. We talked over matters here, and 
concluded to say, come as quietly as possible, or not come at present, 
as you may choose. Holmes is at Emporia, plowing ; Conway is 
here, talking politics ; Phillips is here, trying to urge the Free-State 
men to galvanize the Topeka constitution into life. Dr. Robinson s 
absence at the assembling of the Free-State Legislature last winter 
dispirited the Free-State party. It is difficult to make them rally 
again under him. Foster I do not know. Frazee has not returned. 
The others are as you left them. We are prospering finely. You 
will hear much against G. W. Brown and the " Herald of Freedom," 
but be careful about believing it. Brown is as good as ever. 
Most truly your friend,

Letters from, Kansas Friends. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, K. T., Aug. 21, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1857">1857</a>. 

DEAR SIR Your favor of August 8 came duly to hand, as did 
yours to Dr. Prentice. The business you speak of was put into the 
hands of Mr. Realf. Mr. Whitman and Mr. Edmonds 2 are both 
gone East. In regard to other inquiries, I can hardly tell you satisfactorily. I think Dr. Robinson s failure to meet the legislature 
last winter disheartened the people so that they lost confidence in 
him and in the movement. Although in the Convention we invited 
him to withdraw his resignation (which he did), yet the masses 
could never be vitalized again into that enthusiasm and confidence 
which they had before. Another mistake which he made, equally 
fatal, was his attack upon George W. Brown and the Herald of 
Freedom ; " thus leading off his friends into a party by themselves, 
and leaving all who doubted and hated him in another party. This 
war between the leaders settled the question of resistance to outside 
authority at once. Those who had entertained the idea of resistance 
have entirely abandoned it. Dr. Robinson was not alone in his blunders. Colonel Lane, Mr. Phillips, and " The Republican" made 
equally fatal ones. Colonel Lane boasted in his public speeches 
that the Constitutional Convention would be driven into the Kaw 
River, etc., by violence. Mr. Phillips boasted this, and much more, 
in the " <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> Tribune." " The Republican" boasted that old 
Captain Brown would be down on Governor Walker and Co. like an 
avenging god, etc. This excited Walker and others to that degree 
they at once took refuge under the United States troops. Whatever 
might have been intended, much more was threatened and boasted 
of than could possibly have been performed, unless there was an 
extensive conspiracy. This, I believe, Governor Walker says was 
the case. 

I saw Con way to-day. He says he thinks all will go off quietly 
at the election. Phillips, you will see by the " Tribune," has come 
out in favor of voting in October. They intend to cheat us ; but we 
expect to beat them. Walker is as fair as he can be, under the 
circumstances. Yours truly, 

A. WATTLES.

MY DEAR FRIEND, I received your letter of the 8th inst. yesterday. I am glad to hear that you are so near. Messrs. Realf, 
Phillips, and Wattles also received letters from you yesterday. I 
have a word of caution to say in regard to Mr. Wattles. He is a 
friend whom I most highly esteem ; yet he is so connected in politics 
that I think it unsafe for you to communicate to him any plans you 
would not like to communicate directly to Governor Walker. For 
this reason : Mr. Wattles is under George W. Brown ; and both believe in submitting in good faith, under Governor Walker, to the Territorial authorities. Governor Walker comes to town frequently, and 
stops at the " Herald of Freedom" office, in secret conclave with 
G. W. Brown. When you come here (if you should), you can judge for yourself. 

Messrs. Phillips, Wattles, and Realf I have seen ; they will write 
to you themselves, and I will merely give you my own mind on 
the subject. T do not know what you would have me infer by 
tl business." I presume, though, by the word being emphasized, 
that you refer to the business for which I learn you have a stock of 
material with you. If you mean this, I think quite strongly of a 
good(f) opening for this business about the first Monday in October 1 
next. If you wish other employments, I presume you will find just 
as profitable ones. I am sorry that you have not been here in the 
Territory before. I think that the sooner you come the better, so 
that the people and the Territorial authorities may become familiarized with your presence. This is also the opinion of all other friends 
with whom I have conversed on this subject. You could thus exert 
more influence. Several times we have needed you very much. I 
have much to communicate to you, which I cannot do through this 
medium ; therefore you must try to let me know of your approach 
or arrival as soon as possible, through Mr. Phillips, or through the 
Lawrence postoffice. I presume Mr. Phillips wrote to you in regard to teams and means, which, as Mr. Whitman is now East, will 
be, I fear, scarce. 

Most sincerely your friend, 

JAMES H. HOLMES.

DEAR SIR, I send you by the bearer, Richard Realf, one hundred and fifty dollars, minus the reasonable expenses of the messenger on his way up. You will please make arrangements for him to 
return with you. Your friends are desirous of seeing you. The 
dangers that threatened the Territory and individuals have been 
removed, in the shape of quashed indictments. Your furniture can be brought and safely stored while you are seeking a location ; and

MY DEAR FRIEND, I received your letter, dated from Ohio the 
9th instant, a few days ago. I fear I shall not be able to meet you 
at Tabor. I have just received (on the 13th) the task of superin 
tending and taking the census for the State election. As means are 
limited, those who can must do this. I have therefore assumed the 
task, which will require my presence and most active efforts until the 
15th of July. I have tried to arrange it so as to get off for a week ; 
but it is impossible without a sacriiice of duty. Should it be so, or 
if no one else can go, I will still try. Holmes I have seen ; he is 
busy, and will not be able to come up. Severa[ of those you mentioned are gone, and others cannot go to Tabor. I sent a message 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a>, and enclosed your letter to Mr. Adair ; told him that 
Holmes and the others could not go, and urged that some go from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a>, if possible. I have not yet heard from him. I start 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a> when I finish this ; I will make it on my round, ap 
pointing deputies and taking the census. Two young men from 
this place have promised me that they will go if possible ; but they 
have no horses, and horses cannot be hired for such a journey. I 
still hope to have a few friends at Tabor to meet you in a week. 

As to your future action, for fear I should be prevented from going 
to meet you, let me say I think you should come into Kansas, provided you desire to do so. I think it will be our duty to see you 
protected. There is no necessity for active military preparations at 
this time ; but so far as you have the elements of defence at your 
command, I think they are safer with you than with any one else. ^ 
Your old claim has, I believe, been jumped. If you do not desire to 
contest it, let me suggest that you make a new settlement at some 
good point, of which you will be the head. Lay off a town and take 
claims around it. You would thus rally round you a class of useful 
men, who could be prepared for an emergency at the same time that 
they furthered their own interests, which they have a right to do. 
Any information I could render as to the best sites .or otherwise you 
may cheerfully call upon. Should I not be able to come to meet you, 
I hope at least to see you shortly after you enter. I have not time to 
detail the present condition of the Free-State party. Until I see 
you, adieu. Respectfully, 

WILLIAM A. PHILLIPS.

JOHN BROWN, ESQ. 

DEAR SIR, I arrived here to-day from Lawrence, bringing $150, 
minus my expenses up and down. These will amount to about $40, 
leaving you $110. Mr. Whitman could not, as you will see from his 
note signed " Edmunds," spare you more; and the mule team you 
asked fur could not be procured. I am sorry you have not arrived : 
I should like to have gone back with you. The Governor has instructed the Attorney-General of Kansas to enter a nolle prosequi in 
the case of the Free-State prisoners ; so that you need be under no 
apprehension of insecurity as to yourself or the munitions you may 
bring with you. By writing a line to me or Mr. Whitman or Phil

and meet you by way of Topeka. God speed you !

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1857">1857</a>.] THE KANSAS COMMITTEES. 399 

your earnest and early attention to my wants and those of my family. 
I regret that Mr. Huunewell did not at once send me either a check 
or a draft on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> or <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, as it will probably be one mouth 
or more before I can realize it ; and I have not the means of paying 
my board bill here, not having as yet received anything from Mr. 
Whitman toward a balance of five hundred "dollars, nor heard from 
him. If I get the money from Mr. Hunnewell and Mr. Whitman, it 
will answer my present wants, except the secret service I wrote you 
about. I have all the arms I am likely to need, but am destitute 
of saddle-bags or knapsacks, holsters and belts ; have only a few 
blankets, no shovels or spades, no mattocks, but three or four adzes 
(ought to have been one hundred), and am nearly destitute of cook 
ing utensils. The greater part of what I have just named I must do 
without till another spring, at any rate. I found here one brass 
field-piece complete, and one damaged gun-carriage, with some am 
munition suitable for it j some seventy to seventy-five old damaged 
United States rifles and muskets, one dozen old sabres, some powder 
and lead (enough for present use; weight not known), I suppose 
sent by National Committee. Also one dozen boxes and barrels of 
clothing, boots, etc., with three hand gristmills, sent to Nebraska 
City, from same source. I also got from Dr. Jesse Bo wen, of Iowa 
City, one old wagon, which broke down with a light load on the 
way; also nine full-rigged tents, three sets tent-poles (additional), 
eleven pairs blankets, and three axes, sent there by National Committee. Also from Mr. Kurd I got an order for fifty dollars worth 
of tents, wagon-covering, ropes, etc., at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">Chicago</a>, which was paid 
me. I find one hundred and ninety-four carbines, about thirty-three 
hundred ball cartridges, all the primers, but no iron ladles. This, I 
believe, with the teams and wagon I purchased, will give you a pretty 
good idea of the stuff I have. I had a gun and pair of pistols given 
me by Dr. Howe, and some three or four guns made for experiment 
by Mr. Thayer (a little cannon and carriage is one of them), and one 
nice rirle by the manufacturing company at Worcester. 1 I had also 
a few revolvers, common guns, and sabres left on hand, that I took 
on with me in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1855">1855</a>. While waiting here T and my son have been 
trying to learn a little of the arts of peace from Colonel F., who is 
still with us. That is the school I alluded to. 

Before I reached here, T had written particularly to friends in 
Kansas, saying that I wanted help to meet me here, and to wait for 
me should I be detained on the way. I also arranged with Mr. 
Whitman in regard to it in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">Chicago</a>. He sent one man with one 
hundred and fifty dollars ; forty of it he kept, and went immediately 
back. From that time I send you copies of some of the correspondence between Kansas and me, as rather essential to give you a 
correct idea of things in connection with my statements yet to be 
made. When I got on here I immediately wrote Mr. Whitman 
and several others what was my situation and wants. He (Mr. 
Whitman) has not written me at all since what I send. Others 
have written, as you will see. I wrote the man Mr. Whitman 
sent me, among the rest, but get no word from him since what I 
now send. 

As to the policy of voting on Monday next, I think Lane hit his 
mark at the convention of Grasshopper s, if never before; I mean 
An escape into the filthy sluice of a prison." I had not been able 
to learn by papers or otherwise distinctly what course had been taken 
in Kansas till within a few days; and probably the less I have to 
say, the better. 

I omitted above to say that I paid out five hundred and fifty dollars on a contract for one thousand superior pikes, as a cheap but 
effectual weapon to place in the hands of entirely unskilful and unpractised men, which will not easily get out of order, and require no 
ammunition. They will cost, handles and all complete, a little short 
of one dollar each. That contract I have not been able to fulfil ; and 
wise military men may ridicule the idea; but "I take the whole 
responsibility of that job," so that I can only get them. 

On hearing that Lane had come into Nebraska, I at once sent a 
young man with a line, saying I had been hurt, and was exceedingly 
anxious to see him early in September. To this he sent me no reply, 
unless Redpath s letter be one. I am now so far recovered from my 
hurt as to be able to do a little ; and foggy as it is, " we do not give 
up the ship." I will not say that Kansas, watered by the tears arid 
blood of my children, shall yet be free or I fall. I intend at once to 
put the supplies I have in a secure place, and then to put myself and 
such as may go with me where we may get more speedy communi 
cations, and can wait until we know better how to act than we now 
do. I send this whole package to you, thinking Concord a less offensive name just now than <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> at this end of the route. I wish the 
whole conveyed to my friend Stearns and other friends, as old Brown s 
last report. 

Until further advised, I wish all communications addressed to Jonas 
Jones, Esq., <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tabor" rel="city">Tabor</a>, Fremont County, Iowa, outwardly ; and I hope 
you will all write often. 

I had forgotten to say, that day before yesterday one single man, 
with no team at all, came from Lane to have me start at once for 
Kansas, as you will see by copies. He said he had left ten fine 
fellows about thirty miles back. The names he gave me were all strange to me, as well as himself. Tabor folks (some of them) 
speak slightingly of him, notwithstanding that he too is a general. 

October 3, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1857">1857</a>. 

Yours, covering check, is this moment to hand, and will afford 
most seasonable relief. Express goes to K. at once to see how the 
land lies. You will hear again soon.

he had not arrived when I left. It is all-important to Kansas that 
your things should be in at the earliest possible moment, and that you 
should be much nearer at hand than you are. I send you all the money 
I have (fifty dollars), and General Jamison has some more. We 
want every gun and all the ammunition. I do not know that we will

DEAR SIR, Please send me by Mr. Charles P. Tidd what money 
you have for me, not papers. He is the second man I have sent in order to get the means of taking me through. General Lane sent a 
man who got here without any team, with but fifty dollars of Lane s 
money (as he saidj, which I returned to him, and wanted me to start 
right off, with only four days time to load up and drive through before 
this bogus election day, which my state of health and the very wet 
weather rendered it impossible to do in time; and I did not think it 
right to start from here under such circumstances. Do try to make 
me up the money, all in good shape, before Mr. Tidd returns, and 
also write me everything you know about the aspect of things in 
Kansas. Please furnish Mr. Tidd with a horse to take him to Osawatornie, and greatly oblige me. The fifty dollars Lane sent was 
only about enough to pay up my board bill here, with all I had on 
hand. I need not say my disappointments have been extreme.

(Order No. 2.) 

QUARTERMASTER S DEPARTMENT, HEADQUARTERS KANSAS 

VOLUNTEERS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE BALLOT-BOX, 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lawrence" rel="city">Lawrence</a>, Oct. 19, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1857">1857</a>. 

Whereas, On the 3d day of August an order was issued from this 
department requesting the appointment of company, brigade, and 
division quartermasters, and an immediate return to be made of the 
number and description of all arms available^ &gt;r the use of the respective companies; and whereas, said returns have been generally made : 
Now, therefore, in reply, and in explanation of the failure to furnish 
an entire supply for the deficiency, it is deemed proper to declare, that 
while no efforts were spared by this department, and by the entire 
staff, promptly to supply the necessary quota of arms, yet the unexpected obstacles which the great financial pressure threw in their 
way have prevented the anticipated success for the time being. It 
is, however, a cause for congratulation, that while the reports show 
a considerable deficiency, yet the entire armament is by no means insignificant. 

The immense immigration of the past year, composed largely of 
those who deceived by official promises of protection had anticipated 
no occasion for personal defence, readily accounts for this deficiency. 
In our disappointment we may rejoice that the effect of the organization, with all its imperfections, has been in the highest degree satis 
factory. The knowledge that an outraged people had at length 
banded themselves together, almost to a man, for the protection of 
the most sacred rights of freemen, and were ready to die in their de 
fence, has most manifestly deterred an organized invasion. Voting- 
lists ready manufactured and false returns have been made to supply 
its place ; against this the organization could afford no protection. 

It remains to be seen whether the people of Kansas will have any 
further use for this organization. It is always true that the surest 
way to prevent an evil is to be prepared to meet it, and.three years 
experience in the past should teach us not to indulge in any pre 
mature feelings of security and safety. In view of possible contingencies, this department hereby announces that it will still continue 
its exertions to furnish the means of protection and defence to all who 
may be destitute of them, and in all cases first to supply those localities most exposed to invasion and attack.

Mr DEAR FRIEND, Your first two messengers are sick at Tccmnseh. I helped them start back with the information that you 
should soon hear from me, but they were taken sick on their way. 
Mr. Tidd has been waiting some time for me to receive remittances 
from the East ; but as the crisis approaches I feel in a hurry to get 
him off. You are wanted here a week from Tuesday. I will wait 
no longer, but by great personal exertion have raised on my personal 
responsibility one hundred and fifty dollars. General Lane will send 
teams from Falls City, so that you may get your goods all in. 
Leave none behind if you can help it. Come direct to this place and 
see me before you make any disposition of your plunder, except to 
keep it safe. Make the Tabor people wait for what you owe them. 
They must Make the money I send answer to get here, and I hope 
by that time to have more for you. Mr. Tidd will explain all. 
Very truly yours, 

E. B.

DEAR SIR, By great sacrifice we have raised, and send by Mr. Tidd, one hundred and fifty dollars. I trust this money will be used 
to get the guns to Kansas, or as near as possible. If you can get 
them to this point, we will try to get them on in some way. The 
probability is Kansas will never need the guns. One thing is certain : if they are to do her any good, it will be in the next few days. 
Let nothing interfere in bringing them on. 

Yours, J. H. LANE.

MY DEAR SIR, ... In regard to the security you mention, 
for being responsible for Colonel Carter, I will say, it is most reason 
able ; but as I deem it most uncertain what will become of things I 
carry into the war, and as I need arms " more than I do bread," I 
propose not to draw on you for the amount named, thirteen hundred dollars, and will not. 

This, I trust, will be entirely satisfactory to you, and a vastly better security. I am exceeding glad of the arrangement with Colonel 
Carter, whom I have written. I leave here for the West to-day, 
with health some improved, and shall be much gratified with getting 
a line from you, addressed to Orson M. Oviatt, Esq., <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a>,

The allusion above is to the generous offer of Mr. Stearns 
to guarantee the payment for two hundred revolvers, made 
by him in these letters of May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1857">1857</a> : 

May 4. I have written to Colonel Carter that I will be responsible for the payment of thirteen hundred dollars for two hundred 
revolvers, as you propose, and have requested him to write to you if he accepts my proposal. 1 If be does not, I will write to you again. 
If I pay for these revolvers, I shall expect that all the arms and ammunition, rifles as well as revolvers, not used for the defence of 
Kansas, shall be held as pledged to me for the payment of this 
amount. To this our committee have assented by a vote passed on 
Saturday, and I have no doubt you will assent to it. If you do not, 
let me know your reasons. 

May 6. I think you ought to go to Kansas as soon as possible, 
and give Robinson and the rest some backbone. 

May 11. I am glad to know that you are on your way to Kansas : 
the Free- State, leaders need somebody to talk to them. I hope you 
will see Con way very soon after your arrival. I did not expect you 
to return, or hold pledged to me, any arms you used in Kansas, but 
only such as were not used.

Some days since, while on my way home [to North Elba, N. Y.], 
sick with fever and ague, I got your favor of the 29th April, saying, 
11 Mr. Lawrence has agreed with me that the one thousand dollars 
shall he made up, and will write to Gerrit Smith to-day or to-mor 
row, to say that he can depend on the money from him." After 
getting home I agreed with two young men (by the name of Thompson) who had bargained with Mr. Smith for the farm several years ago, and paid him in part for it, and who had made the 
improvements on it, that I would take the farm, pay the balance 
due Mr. Smith (some two hundred dollars), and the remainder, 
about eight hundred dollars, to them; which would enahle them 
to pay for another farm which they had before bought of a Mr. 
Lawton, and were unable to pay for. Three days ago one of these 
men set out for Peterboro (the home of Gerrit Smith) to meet 
me there, on my way West, and have the thing completed. I 
will now say (" frankly," as you suggest) that I must ask to have 
the one thousand dollars made up at once and forwarded to Gerrit 
Smith. I did not start the measure of getting up any subscription 
for me (although I was sufficiently needy, as God knows), nor had 
I a thought of further burdening either of my dear friends Stearns or 
Lawrence.

Your most kind letter of the 26th of April I did not get till 
within the last two or three days, and then I was on my way 
West, full of cares, and in feeble health. I have just written my 
friend Steams a letter of explanation, in which I frankly ask that 
the one thousand dollars donation I was so generously encouraged 
to expect for the permanent assistance of my wife and children be, 
under the circumstances as so explained, promptly raised. This, 
I think, much the cheapest and most proper way to provide for 
them, and far less humiliating to my wife, who, though not above 
getting her bread over the washtub, will never tell her trials or her 
wants to the world. This I know by the experience of the past two 
years, while I was absent ; but I would never utter a syllable in regard to it, were I not conscious that I am performing that service 
which is equally the duty of millions, who need not forego a single 
hearty dinner by the efforts they are called on to make. I did not 
mean to burden my friends Stearns and Lawrence further with the 
thing. I do not love to " ride free horses till they fall down dead."

Your favor of the 13th was received yesterday. Mr. Lawrence

hundred dollars, and let you mortgage for four hundred dollars. I 
learn to-day from Mr. Sanborn that Gerrit Smith intends to aid you 
in this, and also obtain something for your enterprise in his neighborhood. My agreement with Mr. Lawrence was that he having 
five hundred and fifty dollars towards the one thousand dollars, I 
would be responsible for one-half of the deficiency, if he would 
provide the other half, and when he returns I shall tell him he must fulfil the agreement with me. He will be home the 1st of June.

MY DEAR SIR, On my arrival at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cleveland" rel="city">CLEVELAND</a> yesterday, I found 
with 0. M. Oviatt, Esq., your favors of the 16th and 19th iust. I 
had made no previous arrangement with Mr. Smith about the land, 
other than to say that I wanted the contract with the Thompsons 
made over to me on payment, or to that effect. He had given me no 
encouragement of any help about it from him ; and when I met one 
of the Thompsons there, 1 all I could do was to get both parties to 
agree to the arrangement, and to wait until the money could get on 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. Mr. Smith had before written me that his last year s 
efforts for Kansas had embarrassed him, but that when the struggle 
was renewed he would do all he could. He gave me fifty dollars, 
Mrs. S. ten dollars and some little useful articles ; Peterboro friends 
gave me thirty-one dollars, and I came on with the understanding 
that probably the thousand dollars would soon be sent on to Mr. 
Smith. I lost about one week on my way to my family with ague 
and fever, and left home feeble, and am still so. I could promise 
Colonel Carter no more than pay for primings, which I had not bar 
gained for. I shall redeem my promise to you as soon as I am able to do so. Please write me next to Dr. Jesse Bo wen, Iowa City,

MY DEAR SIR, I did not intend to do any more than to write a 
" heading " for a subscription for Captain Brown, and subscribe for 
myself. But he was desirous to have me do more, and I have, as 
the paper shows. I wish I could do the whole. But I am behind 
hand in everything. My business extends through a large part of 
the twenty-four hours, and prevents my devoting as much time as 
would be desirable to push on this and similar good projects for 
individual advantage. If Captain Brown should be killed or disabled, then I should be held for the one thousand dollars.

There is some prospect that Owen will go on with me. If I should

of grandfather. I think I have several good reasons for this. I

MY DEAR SIR, In consequence of ill-health and other hindrances too numerous and unpleasant to write about, the least of 
which has not been the lack of sufficient means for freight bills and 
other expenses, I have never as yet returned to Kansas. This has 
been unavoidable-, unless I returned without securing the principal 
object for which I came back from the Territory ; and I am now 
waiting for teams and means to come from there to enable me to go 
on. I obtained two teams and wagons, as I talked of, at a cost of 
seven hundred and eighty-six dollars, but was obliged to hire a 
teamster and to drive one team myself. This unexpected increase of 
labor, together with being much of the time quite unwell and de 
pressed with disappointments and delays, has prevented my writing 
sooner. Indeed, I had pretty much determined not to write till I 
should do it from Kansas. I will tell you some of my disappointments. I was flattered with the expectation of getting one thousand 
dollars from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hartford" rel="city">Hartford</a> City and also one thousand dollars from New 
Haven. From <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hartford" rel="city">Hartford</a> I did get about two hundred and sixty dol 
lars, and a little over in some repair of arms. From New Haven I 
got twenty- five dollars; at any rate, that is all I can get any advice 
of. Gerrit Smith supplied me with three hundred and fifty dollars, or I could not have reached this place. He also loaned me one hundred and ten dollars to pay to the Thompsons who were disappointed 
of getting their money for the farm I had agreed for and got posses 
sion of for use. I have been continually hearing from them that I 
have not fulfilled, and that I told them I should not leave the country 
till the thing was completed. This has exceedingly mortified me. I 
could tell you much more had I room and time. Have not given up. 
Will write more when I get to Kansas.

Much as I love to communicate with you, it is still a great burden 
for me to write when I have nothing of interest to say, and when 
there is something to be active about. Since I left New England I 
have had a good deal of ill-health ; and having in good measure exhausted my available means toward purchasing such supplies as I 
should certainly need if again called into active service, and without 
which I could accomplish next to nothing, I had to begin my journey back with not more than half money at any time to bear my 
expenses through and pay my freights. This being the case, I was 
obliged to stop at different points on the way, and to go to others off 
the route to solicit help. At most places I raised a little ; but it 
consumed my time, and my unavoidable expenses so nearly kept 
pace with my incomes that I found it exceedingly discouraging. 
With the help of Gerrit Smith, who supplied me with sixty dollars 
at Peterboro , and two hundred and fifty dollars at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">Chicago</a>, and 
other smaller amounts from others, I was able to pay freights and 
other expenses to this place; hiring a man to drive one team, and 
driving another myself; and had about twenty-five dollars on hand, 
with about one hundred dollars worth of provisions, when I reached 
here. Among all the good friends who had promised to go with me, 
not one could I get to stick by me and assist me on my way through. 
I have picked up, at different times on the way, considerable value 
in articles (indispensable in active service) which were scattered on 
the way, and had been provided either by or for the National Committee. On reaching here I found one hundred and ten dollars, sent 
me by Mr. Whitman, from sale of articles in Kansas, sent there by 
the National Committee. This is all the money I have got from 
them on their appropriation at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. On the road one of my 
horses hurt himself so badly that I lost about ten days in consequence, not being in condition to go on without him, or to buy or to 
hire another. I find the arms and ammunition voted me by the 
Massachusetts State Committee nearly all here, and in middling good 
order, some a little rusted. Have overhauled and cleaned up the 
worst of them, and am now waiting to know what is best to do 
next, or for a little escort from Kansas, should I arid the supplies be 
needed. I am now at last within a kind of hailing distance of our 
Free-State friends in Kansas. 

On the way from Iowa City I and my third son (the hired man I 
mentioned), in order to make the little funds we had reach as far as 
possible, and to avoid notice, lived exclusively on herring, soda 
crackers, and sweetened water for more than three weeks (sleeping 
every night in our wagons), except that twice we got a little milk, 
and a few times some boiled- eggs. Early in the season, in consequence of the poor encouragement I met with, and of their own 
losses and sufferings, my sons declined to return ; and my wife wrote 
me as follows : " The boys have all determined both to practise and 
learn war no more." This I said nothing about, lest it should pre 
vent my getting any further supplies. After leaving New England 
I could not get the scratch of a pen to tell whether anything had 
been deposited at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hartford" rel="city">Hartford</a>, from New Haven and other places, for 
me or not; until, since I came here, a line comes from Mr. Callender, 
dated 24th July, saying nothing has been deposited, in answer to 
one I had written June 22, in, which he further says he has answered all my letters. The parting with my wife and young uneducated children, without income, supplies of clothing, provisions, or 
even a comfortable house to live in, or money to provide such things, 
with at least a fair chance that it was to be a last and final separation, had lain heavily on me, and was about as much a matter of self- 
sacrifice and self-devotion on the part of my wife as on my own, and 
about as much her act as my own. When Mr. Lawrence, of his 
own accord, proposed relieving me on that score, it greatly eased a 
burdened spirit ; but I did not rely upon it absolutely, nor make any 
certain bargain on the strength of it, until after being positively as 
sured by Mr. Stearns, in writing, that it should, and by yourself that 
it would, certainly be done. 

It was the poor condition of my noble-hearted wife and of her 
young children that made me follow up that encouragement with a 
tenacity that disgusted him and completely exhausted his patience. 
But after such repeated assurances from friends I so much respected 
that I could not suspect they would trifle with my feelings, I made 
a positive bargain for the farm ; and when I found nothing for 
me at Peterboro , I borrowed ono hundred and ten dollars of Mr. 
Smith for the men who occupied the farm, tilling him it would certainly be refunded, and the others that they would get all their 
money very soon, and even before I left the country. This has 
brought me only extreme mortification and depression of feeling; 
for all my letters from home, up to the last, say riot a dime has 
been paid in to Mr. Smith. Friends who never know the lack of 
a sumptuous dinner little comprehend the value of such trilling 
matters to persons circumstanced as I am. But, my noble-hearted 
friend, I am " though faint, yet pursuing." My health lias been 
much better of late. I believe my anxiety and discouragements 
had something to do with repeated returns of fever and ague I have 
had, as it tended to deprive me of sleep and to debilitate me. I 
intend this letter as a kind of report of my progress and success, as 
much for your committee or my friend Stearns as yourself. I have 
been joined by a friend since I got here, and get no discouraging 
news from Kansas. Your friend,

DEAR FRIEND, Yours of September 5 was received yesterday, 
having been mailed at Lawrence the day before. Your whereabouts 
had for some time been to us unknown. The letter you sent to " Mr.

said that the last he had heard of you, you had gone to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">Chicago</a>, 
but expected you would return to Tabor again before long ; thought

one ; but the state of my own health and of my family forbids my 
going to Tabor at present. For nearly five weeks past I have spent 
most of my time in taking care of the sick, when able to do anything. 
I had a man hired to work for me, who about the 1st of September 
was ta,ken very sick (fever and internal inflammation) ; has been 
better, and again worse, and is still dangerous. I was absent nearly 
one week at Lecompton, as a witness in the case of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=osawatomie" rel="city">Osawatomie</a> 
town site; some outsiders having tried to preempt a part of it. 
Had to hire a man during my absence, to take care of the sick man. 
Since my return I have been much troubled with illness, sometimes severe when I exercise much. Florella and the babe have very sore 
throats; the babe is teething, has chills sometimes, and requires 
much care. Charles and Emma are well at present. Mrs. Garrison l 
and babe have been with us since the first of June until last week. 
She came back, went to Lecompton to preempt her claim in June, 
just before the laud-office closed ; but did not succeed, because I 
could not swear that she had as a widow built, or caused to be 
built, a house on the claim. The house her husband built they 
would not recognize as being built by her " as a widow." She had 
to return and have another built, which has been done. She went 
last week and preempted, and has returned to Ohio. For a number 
of weeks before she left she and her babe had both been sick. 
Though we have not had much sickness among the members of our 
own family proper, yet we are in a measure worn out taking care of 
the sick. We greatly feel the need of rest and quiet. There is a 
good deal of sickness around, chiefly among the more recent 
emigrants. It has been drier here this year than last. My corn and 
potatoes are almost an entire failure. Mine were planted early; 
later crops have done better. 

As to political matters, I have my own views of things. Walker 
has disgraced himself, has not fulfilled a pledge made in his 
Topeka speech ; indeed, I never had confidence to believe he would. 
But the Free-State men have determined to go into the October 
election, and many are sanguine that they will carry it. I may be 
disappointed, but cannot see things in so favorable a light as they do. 
An invasion such as we had in 54 and 55 I do not expect ; but 
doubtless many voters from slave States will be smuggled in, and 
fraudulent returns will be made ; nor do I suppose it will be possible 
for the Free- State men to show up the frauds so as to gain their 
ends. The showing up of frauds does not amount to much where 
those who are to decide upon the frauds are abettors or perpetrators 
of them, and the highest rewards are given from headquarters for 
the most bold and outrageous perpetrators. Hence I rather expect 
that the proslavery men will carry the day October 5. If disap 
pointed, I shall rejoice. What course things will take if the Free- 
State men fail, I do not know. Some prophesy trouble right alon^. 
This would not surprise me were it to occur. But I would deplore 
a renewal of war. If it is to be commenced again, the boil had 
better be probed in the centre, at Washington, where the corruption is the worst. The proslavery men in the Territory are but 
petty tools. 

No recent word from Hudson, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=akron" rel="city">Akron</a>, or Grafton. We have now

It was a year before this that Brown, in September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1857">1857</a>, 
began to prepare the minds of his Eastern friends for the 
full scope of his purposes. He was then at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tabor" rel="city">Tabor</a>, in Western Iowa, where he had opened a small school for military 
drill, at the head of which was the Garibaldian Briton, Hugh Forbes, the adventurer already described. Brown wrote to 
Theodore Parker, September 11, 

MY DEAR SIR, Please find on other side first number of a series 
of tracts lately gotten up here. I need not say I did not prepare it j 
but I would be glad to know what you think of it, and much obliged 
for any suggestions you see proper to make. My particular object in 
writing is to say that I am in immediate want of some five hundred 
or one thousand dollars for secret service, and no questions asked. I 
want the friends of freedom to " prove me now herewith." Will you 
bring this matter before your congregation, or exert your influence in 
some way to have it, or some part of it, raised and placed in the hands 
of George L. Stearns, Esq., of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, subject to my order? I should 
highly prize a letter from you, directed on the envelope to Jonas 
Jones, Esq., <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tabor" rel="city">Tabor</a>, Fremont County, Iowa. Have no news to send 
by letter. 

Very respectfully your friend,

There having appeared in yesterday s "Tribune " a false and malicious attack upon 
me, I shall, after the trial of John Brown, publish the correspondence between himself, 
his friends, and myself, which correspondence commenced about two years ago, and was 
continued during the spring of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1859">1859</a>. Some Abolitionists of good judgment insisted 
strongly that I should make Brown desist from his projects, which they considered 
would prove fatal to the antislavery cause ; and as there were sundry persons in the 
free States interested, copies of most of the letters were furnished to each of them and 
to Brown. I could not myself take all the copies, therefore some friends occasionally 
copied for me. I feel sure that none of these letters were suffered to be seen by the 
Secretary of War : first, because I have faith in the reliability of those who had them in 
their hands ; and, secondly, because it is absolutely impossible that, had such authen 
tic evidence been placed before him, he could have been taken so by surprise as he was 
at Harper s Ferry.

DEAR FRIEND, I send you a letter this day received from Forbes. During the week I have received a note from Mr. Sumner, who sent me two letters of Forbes to him, in which he says 
these same things. Now, if it were not for the wife and children, 
who are undoubtedly in suffering, the man might be hanged for all 
me, for his whole style towards me is a combination of insult and 
lunacy. But T fear there was such an agreement between him and 
Brown, though Brown has told me nothing of it ; and if so, he has a 
claim upon somebody, though not particularly upon us. Is there 
anything that can be done for him ? I have written to Brown inquiring about the matter, but cannot get an answer before the middle 
of February. Have you heard anything from Brown or Whitman ? 
When you do, please let me hear of it. Forbes s threats are of no 
account, and they, with the vulgar abuse which he uses, show 
what sort of man he is. I shall answer his letter, and send him 
ten dollars. 

January 17. 

Mr. Sunnier suggests that in my note to Forbes I might have 
been " less sharp ; " but the character of F. ? s epistles convinces me 
that, if I erred at all, it was on the side of gentleness. I have since 
received a letter from Forbes himself, in which he goes over the 
same charges and insinuations with " damnable iteration." This 
I have also answered, explaining more fully my position in the matter. Forbes threatens terrible things, meaning, as I conjecture, to 
give notice at the South of Brown s position and designs. Should he 
do this, he would deserve all the suffering which his own carelessness 
has brought on his family ; but their suffering troubles me, and I am 
trying to do something to relieve it, and also to find out from Brown 
the true condition of affairs. 

Yours affectionately, 

F. B. SANBORN.

F. B. Sanborn to Hugh Forbes. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=concord" rel="city">Concord</a> Jan. 15, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1858">1858</a>. 

SIR, Yours of the 9th and 14th is received. I regret that you I 
should have continued the abusive strain of your letter to Mr. Sumner, towards a person of whom you are wholly ignorant, and whose 
character you so greatly mistake. Let me give you some facts, 
which you may believe or not, as you choose. I became acquainted 
with Captain Brown a little more than a year ago, and have since 
been his warm friend and admirer. Being a member of the Massachusetts Kansas Committee, I interested myself with my col 
leagues in his behalf, and we furnished him with some five thousand 
dollars in arms and money. As a temporary member of the National 
Committee, I procured the passage of a resolution appropriating five 
thousand dollars from that committee also, of which, however, only 
five hundred dollars has been paid. I also introduced him to a pub 
lic meeting of my townsmen, who raised something for him. In the 
summer I visited Mr. Gerrit Smith, and made arrangements with 
him for the settlement of property worth one thousand dollars on the 
wife and daughter of Captain Brown. The money was raised in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> by the men whom you calumniate. I visited the families in 
the wilderness where they live, and arranged the transfer of property. 
Mr. Smith first mentioned your name to me, unless it were a 
member of his family, Mr. Morton. Captain Brown had never 
done so, nor did any one hint to me that there was any agreement 
between you and him of the kind you mention. I think I wrote to 
Brown from Peterboro , informing him that you were at Davenport, 
having seen your letter to Mr. Smith announcing that fact. On 
September 14 I received Mr. Smith s letter, asking that some money 
be raised for your family, but merely on general grounds. I was 
pledged to aid and support Brown, and could not give money to 
persons of whom I knew little or nothing. Had Brown or yourself 
informed me of your agreement, the case would have been different. 
I kept Mr. Smith s draft just a week, returning it to him September 
21 ; it was out of his hands just eleven days. Since then, I have 
had a few letters from Brown, and have seen some from you, but 
have heard nothing of any compact. To answer Brown s call for 
" secret service " money, I procured about six hundred dollars to be 
sent him, which, as he has not yet come into active operations, has 
probably been sufficient. My property is small, my income this 
year hardly up to my expenses j but to carry out the plan which Captain Brown has matured, if the time seemed favorable, I would sacrifice both income and property, as he very well knows. But it is 
probable that Captain Brown placed too much confidence in the 
expectations of others, and that he may have mistaken hopes for 
promises. Does he join in your vituperation of his <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> friends ? 
I know he does not. 

I can excuse much to one who has so much reason for anxiety as 
you have in the distress of your family. Yet be. assured that if you 
had written to me (or if Captain Brown had done so) the true nature 
of your compact with him, I would have supported your wife and 
children rather than have allowed w T hat has happened to take place. 
You knew my address, why, then, did you not write to me rather 
than send a slanderous letter to Mr. Sumner ? 

As for your threats, you are at liberty to speak, write, and publish 
what you please about me, only be careful to keep within the 
limits of your knowledge ; do not tax your imagination for facts. I 
have written to Captain Brown for his statement of the relation between you, and have also sent to Mr. Gerrit Smith for any information 
in his possession. In the mean time I send you ten dollars, promising 
that if I find you have any further claim on me, either in law, justice, or humanity, I will discharge it to the uttermost. 

The gentlemen with whom I am associated, and for whose action 
I am in any way responsible, are honorable men, and as far from 
deserving the vulgar slanders you heap upon them asyour language 
is lacking in common courtesy and justice. They always keep and 
always will keep their engagements ; but they have made none with 
you. You cite the people of New Haven. I have nothing to do 
with them, nor with the other towns which have failed in their 
promises. 

I never saw Hugh Forbes, and have no personal reason to 
esteem him, since his entire correspondence with me and 
with my <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> friends was absurdly violent and unreasonable. Horace Greeley, and those who were bored by him 
in person, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and Washington, have spoken of 
him with much impatience, declaring that he was at once 
fanatical and mercenary, and wholly wanting in common- 
sense. In <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> he was a fencing-master and a hang 
er-on at the " Tribune " office, while his wife and daughter 
lived in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> upon remittances sent by him from New 
York. Gerrit Smith, at whose house he once spent a day 
or two, spoke of him to me as a handsome, soldierly-looking 
man, skilful in the sword-exercise, and with some military 
experience, picked up under Garibaldi in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1848">1848</a>-49. He had 
been a silk-merchant of some sort at Sienna, it was said, 
before he joined Garibaldi. Judged by his letters, his little book ("Manual of the Patriotic Volunteer"), and the 
various accounts given by persons who knew him, he was 
a brave, vainglorious, undisciplined person, with little discretion, and quite wanting in the qualities which would 
fit him to be a leader of American soldiers. Yet he was 
ambitious, eager to head a crusade against slavery, and 
apparently desirous of taking Brown s place as commander 
of what he regarded as a great antislavery movement, sup 
ported by thousands in the Northern States. Accustomed 
to see European insurrections managed by committees out wardly similar to the various antislavery committees which 
he found or heard of in America, he hastily inferred that 
these American committees were all working for the same 
revolutionary end, and were ready to promote a design 
which Brown had as yet communicated to none of them, 
and which none of them would have aided, had they known 
it. He was really connected with Brown s enterprise but a 
few months ; having joined his rendezvous at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tabor" rel="city">Tabor</a>, in 
Iowa, on the 9th of August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1857">1857</a>, and parted from him in 
early November of the same year. His complaining letters 
were the first intimation received by the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> friends of 
Brown that there was any peculiar relation between him 
and the Kansas hero ; and these letters, by a singular chance, 
occasioned the first disclosure of Brown s plans to his <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> friends. 

Frederick Douglass says of Forbes, whom he saw in 
November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1857">1857</a>, and afterwards kept track of for a 
while : 

" After remaining with Brown a short time, he came to me in Ro 
chester with a letter from him, asking me to receive and assist him. 
I was not favorably impressed with Forbes at first ; but I conquered 
my prejudices, took him to a hotel, and paid his board while he 
remained. Just before leaving, he spoke of his family in Europe 
as in destitute circumstances, and of his desire to send them some 
money. I gave him a little, I forget how much, and tli rough 
Miss Ottilia Assing, a German lady deeply interested in the John 
Brown scheme, he was introduced to several of my German friends 
in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. But he soon wore them out by his endless begging; 
and when he could make no more money by professing to advance 
the John Brown project, he threatened to expose it and all connected 
with it. I think I was the first to be informed of his tactics, and I 
promptly communicated them to Captain Brown. Through my 
friend Miss Assing I found that Forbes had told Brown s designs to 
Horace Greeley, and to the government officials at Washington, of 
which I informed Captain Brown ; and this led to the postponement 
of the enterprise another year. It was hoped that by this delay the 
story of Forbes would be discredited ; and this calculation was 
correct, for nobody believed the scoundrel, though he told the 
truth."

To John Brown, Jr. 

DEAR SON JOHN, Forbes s letter to me of the 27th of January I 
enclose back to you, and will be glad to have you return it to him with 
something like the following (unless you c"an think of some serious 
objection), as I am anxious to draw him out more fully, and would 
also like to keep him a little encouraged and avoid an open rupture 
for a few weeks, at any rate. Suppose you write Forbes thus : 

" Your letter to my father, of 27th January, after mature reflection, I have decided to return to you, as I am unwilling he should, 
with all his other cares, difficulties, and trials, be vexed with what I 
am apprehensive he will accept as highly offensive and insulting, 
while I know that he is disposed to do all he consistently can for 
you, and will do so, unless you are yourself the cause of his disgust. 
I was trying to send you a little assistance myself, say about forty 
dollars ; but I must hold up till I feel different from what I now do. 
I understood from my father that he had advanced you already six 
hundred dollars, or six months pay (disappointed as he has been), 
to enable you to provide for your family ; and that he was to give 
you one hundred dollars per month for just so much time as you continued in his service. Now, you in your letter undertake to instruct 
him to say that he had positively engaged you for one year. I fear he 
will not accept it well to he asked or told to state what he considers 
an untruth. Again, I suspect you have greatly mistaken the man, 
if you suppose he will take it kindly in you, or any living man, to 
assume to instruct him how he should conduct his own business and 
correspondence. And I suspect that the seemingly spiteful letters 
you say you have written to some of his particular friends have not 
only done you great injury, but also weakened his hands with them. 
While I have, in my poverty, deeply sympathized with you and 
your family, who, I ask, is likely to be moved by any exhibition of 
a wicked and spiteful temper on your part, or is likely to be dictated 
to by you as to their duties ? 

u I ask you to look over your letter again. You begin with say 
ing, With a little energy, all will yet be right. Is that respectful ? 
and does it come with a good grace from you to the man you thus 
address ? Look it all over ; and if, after having done so, you wish 
him to have it, go on ! you can do so. But as a friend I would 
advise a very different course." 

As I conclude Forbes does not hold you as deeply committed to 
him, he may listen to you ; and I hope he will. I want to see how 
a sharp but well-merited rebuke will affect him ; and should it have 
the desired effect, I would like to get a draft for forty dollars, pay 
able to his order, and remit him at once. I do not mean to dictate to you, as he does to me ; but I am anxious to understand him 
fully before we go any further, and shall be glad of the earliest 
information of the result. . . . 

Your affectionate father, 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">JOHN BROWN</a>.

ROCHESTER, N. Y., Feb. 2, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1858">1858</a>. 

MY DEAR SIR, I am again out of Kansas, and am at this time 
concealing my whereabouts ; but for very different reasons, however, 
from those I had for doing so at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> last spring. I have nearly 
perfected arrangements for carrying out an important measure in 
which the world has a deep interest, as well as Kansas ; and only 
lack from five to eight hundred dollars to enable me to do so, the 
same object for which I asked for secret-service money last fall. It 
is my only errand here j and I have written to some of our mutual 
friends in regard to it, but they none of them understand my views 
so well as you do, and I cannot explain without their first committing 
themselves more than I know of their doing. I have heard that 
Parker Pillsbury and some others in your quarter hold out ideas 
similar to those on which I act ; but I have no personal acquaintance 
with them, and know nothing of their influence or means. Cannot 
you either by direct or indirect action do something to further me f 
Do you not know of some parties whom you could induce to give 
their abolition theories a thoroughly practical shape ? I hope this 
will prove to be the last time I shall be driven to harass a friend in 
such a way. Do you think any of my Ganlsonian friends, either at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, Worcester, or any other place, can be induced to supply a 
little " straw/ if I will absolutely make u bricks"? I have written 
George L. Stearns, Esq., of Mcdford, and Mr. F. B. Sanborn, of 
Concord ; but I am not informed as to how deeply-dyed Abolitionists 
those friends are, and must beg you to consider this communication 
strictly confidential, unless you know of parties who will feel and 
act, and hold their peace. I want to bring the thing about during 
the next sixty days. Please write N. Hawkins, care William J. 
Watkins, Esq., Rochester, N. Y.

DEAR SON JOHN. I am here with our good friends Gerrit Smith 
and wife, who, I am most happy to tell you, are ready to go in fur 
a share in the whole trade. I will say (in the language of another), 
in regard to this most encouraging fact, " My soul doth magnify the

be praise ! I had to-day no particular thing to write, other than to

from you to be forwarded from Kochester ; and may get one to-day. 
When I get one, will write you further. I do not expect to remain

MY DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, I am (praised 
be God !) once more in York State. Whether I shall be permitted 
to visit you or not this winter or spring, I cannot now say ; but it is 
some relief of mind to feel that I am again so near you. Possibly, if one or more of you to meet me somewhere. The anxiety I feel to 
see my wife and children once more I am unable to describe. I want 
exceedingly to see my big baby and Ruth s baby, and to see how that 
little company of sheep look about this time. The cries of my poor 
sorrow-stricken despairing children, whose il tears on their cheeks " 
are ever in my eyes, and whose sighs are ever in my ears, may how 
ever prevent my enjoying the happiness I so much desire. But, 
courage, courage, courage ! the great work of my life (the unseen 
Hand that u guided me, and who has indeed holden my right hand, 
may hold it still," though I have not known him at all as I ought) I 
may yet see accomplished (God helping), and be permitted to return, 
and u rest at evening." 

my daughter Ruth ! could any plan be devised whereby you 
could let Henry go u to school " (as you expressed it in your letter to 
him while in Kansas), I would rather now have him " for another 
term " than to have a hundred average scholars. I have a particular 
and very important, but not dangerous, place for him to fill in the 
11 school," and I know of no man living so well adapted to fill it. I 
am quite confident some way can be devised so that you and your 
children could be with him, and be quite happy even, and safe ; but 
God forbid me to flatter you into trouble ! I did not do it before. 
My dear child, could you face such music if, on a full explanation, 
Henry could be satisfied that his family might be safe f I would 
make a similar inquiry of my own dear wife ; but I have kept her 
tumbling here and there over a stormy and tempestuous sea for so 
many years that I cannot ask her such a question. The natural ingenuity of Salmon in connection with some experience he and Oliver 
have both had, would point him out as the next best man I could now 
select ; but I am dumb in his case, as also in the case of Watson and 
all my other sons. Jason s qualifications are, some of them, like 
Henry s also. 

Do not noise it about that I am in these parts, and direct to N. Hawkins, care of Frederick Douglass, Rochester, N. Y. I want to 
hear how you are all supplied with winter clothing, boots, etc. 

God bless you all !

Ruth Thompson to John Brown. 

NORTH ELBA, Feb. 20, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1858">1858</a>. 

MY DEAR FATHER, Your letter of January 30 we received this 
week, it having lain in the postoffice a week. Oliver went to the 
office and got our news; there were two letters for me, but the 
postmaster did not give him yours. We did not get it this week in 
time to answer it, or we should have done so immediately. I am 
sorry for such a delay. We were rejoiced to hear that you were so 
near us, and we hope that you can visit us yet before leaving York 
State. It really seems hard that we cannot see you, when you have 
been so long from home j yet we are glad that you still feel encour 
aged. Dear father, you have asked me rather of a hard question. 
I want to answer you wisely, but hardly know how. I cannot bear 
the thought of Henry leaving me again ; yet I know I am selfish. 
When 1 think of my poor despised sisters, that are deprived of both 
husband and children, I feel deeply for them ; and were it not for 
my little children, I would go almost anywhere with Henry, if by 
going I could do them any good. What is the place you wish him to 
fill? How long would you want him ? Would my going be of any 
service to him or you ? I should be very glad to be with him, if it 
would not be more expense than what good we could do. I say we ; 
could I not do something for the cause ? Henry s feelings are the 
same that they have been. He says : " Tell father that I think he 
places too high an estimate on my qualifications as a scholar ; and tell 
him I should like much to see him." I wish we could see you, and 
then we should know better what to do ; but will you not write to us 
and give us a full explanation of what you want him to do ? ... 
Please write often. 

Your affectionate daughter, 

RUTH THOMPSON.

To his Wife.

MY DEAR WIFE, I received yours of the 17th of February yesterday ; was very glad of it, and to know that you had got the ten 
dollars safe. I am having a constant series of both great encouragements and discouragements, but am yet able to say, in view of all, 
" hitherto the Lord hath helped me." I shall send Salmon some 
thing as soon as I can, and will try to get you the articles you mention. I find a much more earnest feeling among the colored people 
than ever before ; but that is by no means unusual. On the whole, 
the language of Providence to me would certainly seern to say, 
" Try on." I flatter myself that 1 may be able to go and see you 
again before a great while ; but I may not be able. I long to see 
you all. All were well with John and Jason a few days since. I 
had a good visit with Mr. Sanborn at Gerrit Smith s a few days ago. 
It would be no very strange thing if he should join me. May God 
abundantly bless you all ! No one writes rne but you. 
Your affectionate husband,

MY DEAR FRIEND, When we parted, we were to meet in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> on Friday, March 5. I write now to postpone going to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> until Wednesday, March 10. Please write me at 
Kochester if this will do, and if you wish me to come at that time. 
You can, I hope, find work enough in and about <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> up to 
that date. Please make my warmest regards to Mrs. and Mr. 
Gloucester, and accept that and more for yourself.

F. B. SANBORN, ESQ., <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=concord" rel="city">Concord</a> Mass. 

MY DEAR FRIEND, I want to put into the hands of my young 
men copies of Plutarch s " Lives," Irving s " Life of Washington," 
the best-written Life of Napoleon, and other similar books, together 
with maps and statistics of States. Could you not find persons who 
might be induced to contribute old copies (or other ones) of that 
character, or find some person who would be willing to undertake to 
collect some for me ? I also want to get a quantity of best white 
cotton drilling, some hundred pieces, if I can get it. The use of 
this article I will hereafter explain. Mr. Morton will forward your 
letter here to me. Anything you may be disposed to say to me 
within two or three days please enclose to James N. Gloucester, 
No. 265 Bridge Street, Brooklyn, N. Y. 

Very respectfully your friend, 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">JOHN BROWN</a>. 

P. S. Persons who would devote their time to the good work, as 
agents in different parts, might do incalculable good. Can you find 
any such ? 

Yours, J. B.

John Brown to F. B. Sanborn. 

PETERBORO , N. Y., Feb. 24, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1858">1858</a>. 

MY DEAR FRIEND, Mr. Morton has taken the liberty of saying 
to me that you felt half inclined to make a common cause with me. 
I greatly rejoice at this ; for I believe when you come to look at the 
ample field I labor in, and the rich harvest which not only this entire 
country but the whole world during the present and future generations may reap from its successful cultivation, you will feel that you 
are out of your element until you find you are in it, an entire unit. 
What an inconceivable amount of good you might so effect by your 
counsel, your example, your encouragement, your natural and acquired ability for active service ! And then, how very little we can 
possibly lose ! Certainly the cause is enough to live for, if not to for. I have only had this one opportunity, in a life of nearly sixty 
years ; and could I be continued ten times as long again, I might 
not again have another equal opportunity. God has honored but 
comparatively a very small part of mankind with any possible chance 
for such mighty and soul-satisfying rewards. But, my dear friend, 
if you should make up your mind to do so, I trust it will be wholly 
from the promptings of your own spirit, after having thoroughly 
counted the cost. I would Hatter no man into such a measure, if I 
could do it ever so easily. 

I expect nothing bat to " endure hardness ;" but I expect to effect 
a mighty conquest, even though it be like the last victory of Sam 
son. I felt for a number of years, in earlier life, a steady, strong 
desire to die : but since I saw any prospect of becoming a " reaper " 
in the great harvest, I have not only felt quite willing to live, but 
have enjoyed life much ; and am now rather anxious to live for a 
few years more. 

Your sincere friend,

AMERICAN HOUSE, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, March 4, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1858">1858</a>. 

MY DEAR SIR, I shall be most happy to see you at my room 
(126) in this house, at any and at all hours that may suit your own 
convenience, or that of friends. Mr. Sanborn asked me to be here 
by Friday evening, and as I was anxious to have all the time I could 
get, I came on at once. Please call by yourself and with friends as 
you can. Please inquire for Mr. (not Captain) Brown, of New 
York. Your friend, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">JOHN BROWN</a>.

Brown to Theodore Parker. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, MASS., March 7, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1858">1858</a>. 

MY DEAR SIR, Since you know I have an almost countless brood 
of poor hungry chickens to " scratch for," you will not reproach me 
for scratching even on the Sabbath. At any rate, I trust God will 
not. I want you to undertake to provide a substitute for an address 
you saw last season, directed to the officers and soldiers of the United 
States Army. The ideas contained in that address I of course like, 
for I furnished the skeleton. I never had the ability to clothe those 
ideas in language at all to satisfy myself; and I was by no means 
satisfied with the style of that address, and do not know as I can give 
any correct idea of what I want. I will, however, try. 

In the first place it must be short, or it will not be generally read. 
It must be in the simplest or plainest language, without the least 
affectation of the scholar about it, and yet be worded with great 
clearness and power. The anonymous writer must (in the language 
of the Paddy) be " afther others," and not " afther himself at all, at 
all." If the spirit that communicated Franklin s Poor Richard (or 
some other good spirit) would dictate, I tbink it would be quite as 
well employed as the " dear sister spirits" have been for some years 
past. The address should be appropriate, and particularly adapted 
to the peculiar circumstances we anticipate, and should look to the 
actual change of service from that of Satan to the service of God. It 
should be, in short, a most earnest and powerful appeal to men s 
sense of right and to their feelings of humanity. Soldiers are men, 
and no man can certainly calculate the value and importance of get 
ting a single " nail into old Captain Kidd s chest." It should be 
provided beforehand, and be ready in advance to distribute by all 
persons, male and female, who may be disposed to favor the right. 

I also want a similar short address, appropriate to the peculiar 
circumstances, intended for all persons, old and young, male and 
female, slaveholding and non-slaveholding, to be sent out broadcast 
over the entire nation. So by every male and female prisoner on 
being set at liberty, and to be read by them during confinement. I 
know that men will listen, and reflect too, under such circumstances. 
Persons will hear your autislavery. lectures and abolition lectures 
when they have become virtually slaves themselves. The impres 
sions made on prisoners by kindness and plain dealing, instead of 
barbarous and cruel treatment, such as they might give, and instead 
of being slaughtered like wild reptiles, as they might very naturally 
expect, are not only powerful but lasting. Females are susceptible 
of being carried away entirely by the kindness of an intrepid and 
magnanimous soldier, even when his bare name was but a terror the 
day previous. 1 Now, dear sir, I have told you about as well as I 
know how, what I am anxious at once to secure. Will you write 
the tracts, or get them written, so that I may commence colporteur? 
Very respectfully your friend, 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=job" rel="me">JOHN BROWN</a>. 

P. S. If I should never see you again, please drop me a line 
(enclosed to Stephen Smith, Esq., Lombard Street, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>), 
at once, saying what you will encourage me to expect. You are at 
liberty to make any prudent use of this to stir up any friend. 
Yours for the right, 

J. B.

DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN, EVERY ONE, Since I wrote you 
I have thought it possible, though not probable, that some persons 
might be disposed to hunt for any property I may be supposed to 
possess, on account of liabilities I incurred while concerned with Mr. Perkins. Such claims I ought not to pay if I had ever so much 
given me for my service in Kansas, as most of you well know 1 
gave up all I then had to Mr. Perkins while with him. I think if 
Henry and Ruth have not yet made out a deed, as was talked of, 
they had better not do it at present, but merely sign a receipt I now send, which can be held by Watson ; and I also think that when the 
contract of Gerrit Smith with Franklin and Samuel Thompson is 
found, he had better lay it by carefully with the receipt, and that all 
the family had better decline saying anything about their land matters. Should any disturbance ever be made, it will most likely come 
directly or indirectly through a scoundrel by the name of Warren, 
w r ho defrauded Mr. Perkins and me out of several thousand dollars. 
He may set persons we suppose to be friends (who may, in fact, be 
so) to inquiring out matters. It can do no harm to decline saying 
much about such th
