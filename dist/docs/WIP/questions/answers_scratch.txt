<p>Because in 1784 the peace treaty with England had been ratified and her husband John Adams had just been authorized by Congress to negotiate commercial treaties with European nations. He expected to be away for about two years and thought it was time he and his wife should finally be together again. In truth it had been years since John Adams had lived for more than a few months at a time in their cottage in Brain tree, MA. A reunion was long overdue.</p><p>Surprisingly Abigail was reluctant to join her husband in Europe - what she really wanted was for him to come home. She had never traveled more than 50 miles from her home in Braintree, MA and was afraid of traveling by sea. However, one of the main ties to home had just been severed. Her father had just died and while previously she had not wanted to travel great distances from him because of his old age now she was free to do so. The war was over and so the fear of being captured at sea was now a moot point as well. Additionally their daughter, \"Nabby\" was starting a romantic relationship with a young man whom Abigail liked but John thought unreliable. John\'s recommendation was to bring Nabby let the romance fade naturally over both the great distance and time.</p>

<p>Abigail Adams wrote several hundred letters from many locations including Weymouth, MA, Braintree, MA, Boston, MA., London England and Auteuil, France. She wrote many people notably her husband John Adams, sister Mary (Smith) Cranch, son John Quincy Adams and friend Mercy Otis Warren.</p><p> Many of Abigail Adams's letters were written during the years of the American Revolution while her husband was away for long periods because of work. Several other letters were written from Europe in 1785 and 1786 while she lived overseas with her husband while he served as a diplomat in France and England.</p>

<p>Mary Smith Cranch, born in 1739, was the older sister of Abigail Smith Adams. Mary\'s husband, Richard Cranch, was a friend of John Adams. The Cranch Family and Adams families stayed life long friends and correspondents.</p>

<p>Abigail Adams was never a slave holder. She did not believe in the practice of slavery and felt it contradictory to their own fight for independence from the King of England.</p><p>From a letter to John in 1774 she gives her opinion on slavery:</p><q>I wish most sincerely there was not a slave in the province ; it always appeared a most iniquitous scheme to me to fight ourselves for what we are daily robbing and plundering from those who have as good a right to freedom as we have. You know my mind upon this subject.</q><p>On February 11th, 1784 in another letter to John she just prior to setting sail to join in Europe she writes of letting a newly married, freed slave occupy their house:</p><q>I have determined to put into this house Pheby, to whom my father gave freedom, by his will, and the income of 100 per year during her life... I proposed to her taking care of this House and furniture in my absence. The trust is very flattering to her, and both her Husband and she seem pleased with it. I have no doubt of their care and faithfulness, and prefer them to any other family.</q>

<p>Abigail did not travel widely before her trip to Europe in 1784, as a result she did not have a chance to meet southerner colonists and this may have contributed to her skepticism about the South. Abigail\'s views are made clear in a quote concerning slavery from this letter dated March 31, 1776:</p><q>I have sometimes  been ready to think that the passion for Liberty cannot be Eaquelly Strong in the breasts of those who have been accustomed to deprive their fellow Creatures of theirs. Of this I am certain that it is not founded upon that Generous and christian principal of doing to others as we would that others should do unto us.</q><p>In other words how can you southern slave holders really believe in Liberty as strongly as we northerners when you deprive others of the very thing you claim to seek. Of course both her husband and herself became good friends with Thomas Jefferson, a southern slave holder, during their time on diplomatic missions in Europe so her feelings toward the south may have been ambiguous. Later in the revolutionary war when the fight was brought to Charleston, South Carolina if she did not have reason to rethink her earlier views about the South\'s \'passion for Liberty\' she probably did not doubt their willingness to fight.</p>

//Why did john call abigail Diana?
<p>Using a pen name was common practice during the time that John and Abigail Adams lived. John referred to Abigail as his \'Diana\' out of affection. The Diana he was referring to was the Greek goddess of the same name - best known as the goddess of the hunt. One of Diana\'s main attributes was chastity. John referred to her as Diana early in their correspondence - before they were married.</p>

//Why was Abigail Adams a friend of Thomas Jefferson? 
<p>Abigail met Thomas Jefferson as a result of her husband John\'s work for the U.S. after the revolution. In 1784 John Adams and Thomas Jefferson worked in together on commercial treaties between France and the newly formed United States of America. Both men moved members of their families to France - John Adams because he had not lived with his wife on a regular basis for several years. During their stay in France the families met often and shared the experience of being strangers in a foreign land. Abigail especially found Jefferson\'s company enjoyable because she was having a hard time adjusting to life in Paris.</p><p>When John Adams was named the first ambassador to the court of St. James the family moved to London - leaving Jefferson behind in Paris. During their stay in London, Abigail and Jefferson began a correspondence full of news and political opinions. When John and Abigail did eventually return home to Massachusetts, Jefferson was still in Paris and was sad to see the go as this quote from one of his letters reveals: <q>I have considered you while in London as my neighbor and look forward to the moment of your departure from thence as to an epoch of much regret and concern for me...</q> </p>

//How did John Adams meet Abigail Adams? 
<p>As quoted from "My Dearest Friend - Letters of Abigail and John Adams", page 1</p><block><p>John first mentions Abigail Smith in a Diary entry from the summer of 1759, in which he was less than overwhelmed by her charms - <q>Not fond, not frank, not candid</q> was his overall assessment. Quite possibly John\'s good friend Richard Cranch introduced him to the Smith family. Richard had been spending time in their household in Weymouth, where the Rev. William Smith served as minister, and would eventually marry Abigail\'s older sister mary in 1762.</p><p>Despite his poor first impression, John continued to visit the family and obviously grew increasingly enamored of Abigail. By 1762, the date of their first extant letter, they had become intimates if not yet formally engaged. John\'s mother, Susanna Boylston Adams, initially objected to the relationship but <q>brought herself to acquiesce</q> in the face of John\'s persistence. Once John had successfully established his law career sufficient to support a family, they were free to marry; the ceremony, officiated by Abigail\'s father, took place in October 1764.</p></block>

//Why does John Adams sign his letters to Abigail as "Lysander"? 
<p>Using pen names was common during the time that John and Abigail lived. Both John and Abigail had studied the Greek and Roman classics and drew inspiration for pen names from this time. Lysander was a Spartan general and war hero who defeated the Athenians at sea during the 5th century B.C. It\'s possible that John was a fan of Lysander and so choose his pen name accordingly. It\'s also possible that pen names were used during the Revolutionary War in part to disguise their true identities in case the letters fell into the hands of the British.</p>

//Why did abigail adams go to London? (28)
<p>Abigail traveled to London twice during her lifetime. The first (brief visit) was on her way to France in 1784 as a result of her husband John\'s work for America after the revolution. Roughly one year later John was named the first ever Ambassador from America to England. John and Abigail moved to London around May of 1785 and took up residence at number 8, Grosvenor Square in London\'s West End. At time London had a population of roughly one million people and must have felt like an immense, and busy metropolis to Abigail who had grown up in the quiet New England countryside. They lived in London until returning home in March of 1788. They were both happy to return home - and Abigail wrote in her diary that she would be quite happy to learn about the world from the pages of books.</p>

//How did Abigail Adams feel about Thomas Jefferson?
<p>Abigail\'s feelings toward Thomas Jefferson varied over the years - largely depending on the state of Jefferson\'s own relationship with John Adams. Prior to 1784, when the Adams move to Paris, Abigail had only met Jefferson briefly on a few occasions. During the time that both Adams and Jefferson served in Paris - their families grew close. Abigail especially enjoyed the company of Jefferson as she had a difficult time adjusting to life in Paris. She was of New England Puritan stock and had not traveled more that 50 miles from home until the move to Europe.</p><p>When John Adams was named the first ambassador to the court of St. James the family moved to London - leaving Jefferson behind in Paris. During their stay in London, Abigail and Jefferson began a correspondence full of gossip, news and political opinions. Additionally, during their stay in London Abigail helped care for Jefferson\'s youngest daughter, Polly, who was in transit from Virginia to her father in Paris. When John and Abigail did eventually return home to Massachusetts, Jefferson was still in Paris and was sad to see the go as this quote from one of his letters reveals: <q>I have considered you while in London as my neighbor and look forward to the moment of your departure from thence as to an epoch of much regret and concern for me...</q></p><p>Abigail and Jefferson\'s friendship seemed genuine which probably made his actions during his term as Adams Vice President and later during the Presidential election of 1800 all the more bitter. Campaigning during the election of 1800 was not carried out by Adams and Jefferson directly - rather by their respective political sides and the newspapers of the day. The newspapers in particular used graphic, over the top language to describe each of the opponents. Jefferson gave financial support to James Callender who wrote a series of essays in the Richmond Examiner slandering Adams. Callender went beyond the usual accusations of monarchist and war monger he added personal attacks such as calling him <q>a gross hypocrite</q> and <q>in his private life, one of the most egregious fools upon the continent.</q> It was Jefferson\'s financial support of Callender that most upset Abigail. From a series of remarkable and candid letters written between Jefferson and Abigail in 1804 is the following: </p><blockquote>Until I read Callender\'s seventh letter containing your compliment to him as a writer and your reward of fifty dollars, I could not be made to believe that such measures could have been resorted to, to stab the fair fame and upright intentions of one who, to use your own language, <q>was acting from an honest conviction in his own mind that he was right.</q> This Sir, I considered as a personal injury ; this was the sword that cut asunder the Gordian knot, which could not be untied by all the efforts of party spirit, by rivalry, by jealousy, or any other malignant fiend.</blockquote><p>Perhaps what best sums up her final feelings toward Jefferson is this quote taken from one of her final letters to Jefferson: <q>Affection still lingers in the bosom, even after esteem has taken flight.</q></p>

//Why did Abigail Adams write to Thomas Jefferson after 17 years? (33)
<p>Abigail Adams, who was close to Jefferson\'s daughter \'Polly\', wrote a letter of condolence after hearing of Polly\'s death.

//How does Abigial Adams feel when her husband John Adams is gone?  (38)
<p>Abigail desperately missed her husband John when he was away on business for the state and looked forward to his return visits. The quote below, taken from her October 16th, 1774 letter, shows how much she missed John but also shows her awareness that a new era was unfolding and her husband could not remain <q>an inactive spectator</q>.</p><blockquote>I DARE not express to you, at three hundred miles distance, how ardently I long for your return. I have some very miserly wishes, and cannot consent to your spending one hour in town, till, at least, I have had you twelve. The idea plays about my heart, unnerves my hand, whilst I write, awakens all the tender sentiments, that years have increased and matured, and which, when with me, were every day dispensing to you. The whole collected stock of ten weeks absence knows not how to brook any longer restraint, but will break forth and flow through my pen. May the like sensations enter thy breast, and (spite of all the weighty cares of state) mingle them selves with those I wish to communicate ; for, in giving them utterance, I have felt more sincere pleasure, than I have known since the 10th of August. Many have been the anxious hours I have spent since that day ; the threatening aspect of our public affairs, the complicated distress of this province, the arduous and perplexed business in which you are engaged, have all conspired to agitate my bosom with fears and apprehensions to which I have heretofore been a stranger ; and, far from thinking the scene closed, it looks as though the curtain was but just drawn, and only the first scene of the infernal plot disclosed ; and whether the end will be tragical, Heaven alone knows. You cannot be, I know, nor do I wish to see you, an inactive spectator ; but, if the sword be drawn, I bid adieu to all domestic felicity, and look forward to that country, where there are neither wars nor rumors of war, in a firm belief, that, through the mercy of its King, we shall both rejoice there together.</blockquote>


//How does Abigial Adams feel about Alexander Hamilton?
<p>Abigail dis-liked Hamilton for his reported infidelities and over ambitiousness. In a letter to her husband John Adams she writes <q>You may recollect that I have often said to you, H. is a man ambitious as Julius Ceasar. A subtle intriguer, his abilities would make him more dangerous if he was to espouse the wrong side. His thirst for fame is insatiable. I have ever kept my eye upon him.</q> Considering her pen-name was \"Portia\" - wife to Brutus, one of the chief assassins of Ceasar, this quote seems to echo an especially strong sentiment.</p>

//Why did Abigail Adams dislike Great Britain?
<p>Notice in the quote below from a letter to her husband dated August 19th, 1774 that Abigail uses the phrase \'my country\' which is poignant given that America was not a sovereign state at the time. From this we can infer that Great Britain was in her mind an outside, unwelcome force - a denier of their Liberty.</p><blockquote>The great anxiety I feel for my country, for you, and for our family, renders the day tedious, and the night unpleasant. The rocks and quicksands appear upon every side. What course you can or will take is all wrapped in the bosom of futurity. Uncertainty and expectation leave the mind great scope. Did ever any kingdom or state regain its liberty, when once it was invaded, with out bloodshed? I cannot think of it without horror. Yet we are told, that all the misfortunes of Sparta were occasioned by their too great solicitude for present tranquillity, and, from an excessive love of peace, they neglected the means of making it sure and lasting. They ought to have reflected, says Polybius, that, <q>as there is nothing more desirable or advantageous than peace, when founded in justice and honor, so there is nothing more shameful, and at the same time more pernicious, when attained by bad measures, and purchased at the price of liberty.</q></blockquote><p>Moreover, as she seems to be saying by quoting the historian Polybius, that peace is desirable but not at the expense of justice which if you read between the lines was in short supply at the time. If push came to shove she believed they should fight for liberty even if it meant bloodshed.</p>

//Why did Abigail Adams think about making saltpeter? 
<p>Abigail mentions making saltpeter in a letter to her husband John Adams written on April 5th, 1776.</p><blockquote>You inquire of whether I am making Salt peter. I have not yet attempted it, but after Soap making believe I shall make the experiment. I find as much as I can do to manufacture clothing for my family which would else be Naked. I know of but one person in this part of the Town who has made any, that is Mr. Tertias Bass as he is calld who has got very near an hundred weight which has been found to be very good.</blockquote><p>Saltpeter being an ingredient in gunpowder (which was in short supply) - John was probably encouraging his wife to help their revolutionary cause.</p>

//How has Abigail Adams made an impact on others lives? 
<p>During her lifetime Abigail impacted others directly including: her son John Quincy Adams who later became President of the United States, several pensioners she supported who depended on her for money, and her husband the second President of the United States John Adams who depended on her for advice and support.</p><p>In terms of creating a lasting legacy Abigail was an early advocate for women's rights as well as formal education for women.</p>

//When did Abigail Adams meet the Queen of England? (103)
<p>Abigail was presented to the Queen of England during the summer of 1785 shortly after she and her husband moved to London to fill the role of the first ambassador to England. Abigail attended the Queen\'s Circle (which was a reception line), stood with her family for four hours and exchanged a only few cursory words with the Queen and her daughters. In Abigail\'s own words to her sister Mary</p><blockquote>I could not help reflecting with myself during the ceremony, what a fool I do look like to be thus accoutered and stand for four hours together, only to be spoken to by "rolyalty."</blockquote>

//Why did the Queen of England not want to meet Abigail Adams? (34)
<p>Abigail met the Queen in 1785 which was shortly after the cessation of the American Revolutionary War. Her husband John Adams had just been appointed the first Ambassador to England from the newly formed United States. Ill feelings between the people of both sides were still present. Even though the Adams lived in London they seldom entertained company as would have been expected of an Ambassador. The English were just not ready to accept America as a sovereign nation and popular opinion held that the two nations would of course be joined together once again. In this climate is how and where the Queen met Abigail in a formal reception line. Below is Abigail\'s description of meeting the reception line where she notes that the Queen was \'evidently embarrassed\'.</p><blockquote>Only think of the task! The royal family have to go round to every person, and find small talk enough to speak to all of them, though they very prudently speak in a whisper, so that only the person who stands next you can hear what is said. The King enters the room, and goes round to the right ; the Queen and Princesses to the left. The lord in waiting presents you to the King ; and the lady in waiting does the same to her Majesty. The King is a personable man, but, my dear sister, he has a certain countenance, which you and I have often remarked ; a red face and white eyebrows. The Queen has a similar countenance, and the numerous royal family confirm the observation. Persons are not placed according to their rank in the drawing-room, but promiscuously ; and when the King comes in he takes persons as they stand. When he came to me, Lord Onslow said, \"Mrs. Adams\" ; upon which I drew off my right-hand glove, and his Majesty saluted my left cheek ; then asked me if I had taken a walk today. I could have told his Majesty that I had been all the morning preparing to wait upon him ; but I replied, \"No, Sire.\" \"Why, don\'t you love walking ?\" says he. I answered, that I was rather indolent in that respect. He then bowed, and passed on. It was more than two hours after this before it came to my turn to be presented to the Queen. The circle was so large that the company were four hours standing. The Queen was evidently embarrassed when I was presented to her. I had disagreeable feelings too. She, however, said, \"Mrs. Adams, have you got into your house ? Pray, how do you like the situation of it ?\" Whilst the Princess Royal looked compassionate, and asked me if I was not much fatigued ; and observed, that it was a very full drawing-room. Her sister, who came next, Princess Augusta, after having asked your niece if she was ever in England before, and her answering \"Yes,\" inquired of me how long ago, and supposed it was when she was very young. And all this is said with much affability, and the ease and freedom of old acquaintance.</blockquote>

//Who is "Dunmore" in Abigail Adams letters? (115)
<p>Abigail Adams mentions Lord Dunmore in her famous letter of March 31st, 1776</p><blockquote>I am willing to allow the Colony great merit for having produced a Washington but they have been shamefully duped by a Dunmore.</blockquote><p>Lord Dunmore was the English Royal Governor of Virginia. In 1776 he escaped to the safety of an English man-o-war, called on all slaves to rebel and ordered the bombardment of Norfolk Virginia. To the slaves he promised their freedom if the joined the King\'s forces. [Paraphrased from David McCullough\'s biography \"John Adams\"]</p><p>In response to Abigail\'s above mentioned letter her husband John writes</p><blockquote>It is very true, as you observe, they have been duped by Dunmore. But this is a common case. All the colonies are duped, more or less, at one time and another. A more egregious bubble was never blown up, than the story of Commissioners coming to treat with the Congress, yet it has gained credit like a charm, not only with, but against, the clearest evidence. I never shall forget the delusion which seized our best and most sagacious friends, the dear inhabitants of Boston, the winter be fore last. Credulity and the want of foresight are imperfections in the human character, that no politician can sufficiently guard against.</blockquote><p>The idea of the colonists being \"duped\", or fooled, stemmed from their thinking the English would listen to their grievances over unfair taxation and be willing to negotiate via a special commission which was reportedly coming from England.</p>
