WRITINGS OF JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 



TO RUFUS KING 

QUINCY, 13 October, 1801 



DEAR SIR: 



We landed at Philadelphia the 4th of last month, after a 
tedious though not unpleasant passage of fifty-eight days 
from Hamburg. My wife with her child went on to her 
father s family at Washington, and I came here. The day 
after tomorrow I purpose setting out to go and bring her 
home. In the course of a month I hope to be here again, and 
shall immediately resume the practice of the law, and fix my 
residence in Boston. 

The appearance of our country has very much improved 
since I left it in 1794. I find everywhere the marks of peace 
within our walls, and prosperity within our palaces for 
palaces they may truly be called, those splendid and costly 
mansions which since my departure seem to have shot up 
from the earth by enchantment. 

The pleasure of these prospects is in some measure damped 
by that of the afflictions from which we are not yet ex 
empted. Several of our large towns, New York, Norfolk, 
Charleston, S. C., and some others are bleeding again under 
the scourge of pestilential fevers. But as they did not ap 
pear until a much later than the usual period, and as the 
cold season is rapidly approaching, we hope for speedy relief 
from this distressing calamity. 

Upon the subject of our politics I know not how far it may

should I tell you all, it would not give you a clue to the 
projects and views of any party. The meeting of Congress 
will doubtless discover some of them, and I shall write you 
again upon the subject with the utmost confidence. 

The dismissal of some public officers and the appointment 
(provisionally) of some others have given rise to considerable 
controversy. Remonstrances, replies and pamphlets, pro 
and con, have furnished much conversation for idlers, and 
much discussion for disputants. This has been hitherto the 
only topic of material censure upon the present administra 
tion, and individual feelings have given it a show of im 
portance much beyond that which belongs to it. 1 I am happy 
to know that from the removals of public officers abroad it 
has constantly been determined to except you, and that the 
President has expressed his entire satisfaction with the man 
ner in which you have served the public in your present 
mission. I am, &c.

The measures recommended by the President at the opening 
of the session are all popular, in all parts of the Union; but 
they are all undergoing a scrutiny in the public newspapers, 
more able and more severe, than they will probably meet in 
either House of Congress. A writer in the New York Evening 
Post, said to be General Hamilton, has undertaken particu 
larly to point out great and comprehensive errors of system 
in the message, and his doctrines find great approbation 
among the federalists, and among all those who consider 
themselves as the profound thinkers of the nation. These 
papers will without doubt be transmitted to you by your 
friends at New York and, with the President s message and 
the report from the Secretary of the Treasury, will give you 
the fairest view of what our administration and our opposi 
tion are at this time. As to Congress, there has yet been no 
subject of debate before them which has called forth any 
energy of opposition. The apparently leading ministerial 
members are General Smith, Mr. Giles and Mr. Randolph. 
The Vice President has not yet made his appearance, being 
detained by necessary attention to his private concerns at 
New York. 

The report from the Treasury exhibits a pleasing view of 
the present state of our finances. It is merely a statement, 
and avoids with caution the proposal of any measures. The 
President, however, has drawn from it the inference that our 
internal taxes ought to be repealed. This measure will prob 
ably be carried into effect. The established system of natur 
alization and the judicial courts will have the same fate. Of 
all these changes the advantages are immediate, obvious, 
popular and trifling. Their probable inconveniences are 

treated so fully and ably the period covered, as to leave little to his successors to 
add and less to amend. Adams Memoirs should also be constantly read in con

and executive, they will be satisfied to provide for the occa

1 April 5, Adams was elected a State Senator. Memoirs, April 5, 1802. The 
history of the federal party in Massachusetts from 1802 to 1815, the relations of 
Adams to the political parties, and the record and explanation of his course on 
public measures and policy, were fully expressed in his "Reply to the Appeal of the 
Massachusetts Federalists," prepared in 1829, but not published until 1877, in 
Adams, New England Federalism, 1800-1815. This "Reply" will appear in a later 
volume of these Writings. 

"In May, 1802, Mr. Adams attended a federal caucus, called to nominate coun 
sellors. At this meeting Mr. Adams proposed that/owr of the counsellors should be 
of the republican party. The federal leaders said this man is not our friend, but 
against us. On the only question which divided parties at the spring session, Mr. 
Adams voted with the republicans. At the winter session, his federal friends in 
Boston applied for a Bank charter, and great efforts were made to secure his support. 
He came out, at the hazard of his popularity, in opposition to the wishes of his 
friends, the next day, and made a speech in opposition to the Bank. Failing to 
prevent the grant of a charter, he proposed a new section, by which the subscrip 
tion to the stock should be open to all the citizens of the Commonwealth: when 
this was rejected, he voted in the negative on the final passage of the bill. 

"The same session, the Senate was divided on a petition for the removal of two 
republican Judges, the federal members voted in the affirmative, the republican in 
the negative. Mr. Adams voted in the negative, and in company with Mr. Wood 
man, entered a protest on the record." Independent Chronicle and Boston Patriot, 
May 27, 1828. The first incident occurred May 27, 1802, and Adams then proposed 
to admit to the Council a proportional representation of the minority. Adams,

TO THOMAS BOYLSTON ADAMS 1 

BOSTON, 27 August, 1802. 

I duly received your letters of the 2ist enclosing the 
pamphlet of Gentz. . . . 

You have seen two letters from your father to S. Adams, 
written in 1790, lately published in the newspapers. 2 They 
have been attacked with characteristic violence and bitter 
ness, by the fifty-dollar men at Washington, Worcester and 
Boston. 3 They are defended in the Boston Gazette. The first 
publication was to defeat the basest misrepresentations, 
which were circulating here by the paid slanderers, who had 
seen them, by the treachery of the old prophet, and who were 
affirming that the letters in so many words urged the es 
tablishment of an hereditary monarchy and nobility in this 
country, and named the families of which this nobility was 
to be composed. Judge how much the publication has ex 
asperated those fellows, by taking the lie out of their mouths 
and holding it up to the public view. They are flouncing, 
and foaming and spouting, and dashing with the tail at a 
furious rate; but the harpoon is in them; they shall have their 
full length of rope to plunge downward; and then if they are 
not drawn up, cut up, barrelled up and tried down for the 
benefit of the public, say to all the world that I am the dis 
grace of New-England whale-men. Your s faithfully.

TO RUFUS KING 

BOSTON, 8 October, 1802. 
DEAR SIR: 

We have enjoyed during the summer an extraordinary 
degree of tranquillity, and since the session of Congress ter 
minated in May no public event of material importance has 
happened. The newspapers have been chiefly filled with per 
sonal attacks upon the President and Vice President, com 
ing from different and perhaps opposite quarters all aris 
ing originally from divisions in their own party. These 
divisions have occasioned animosities of no small inveteracy 
between individuals. You have doubtless been better in 
formed of the transactions at New York than it would be in 
my power to inform you. The warfare there has been be 
tween the friends of Mr. Burr and those of the Clinton 
family. In Virginia the principal batteries have been 
pointed at Mr. Jefferson by a Scotsman named Callender, 1 
of whom you have probably heard heretofore. He writes 
under the influence of personal resentment and revenge; but 
the effect of his publications upon the reputation of the 
President has been considerable. 

What the consequences of these internal feuds in the ruling 
party will be is not yet apparent. But independent of them, 
and considered as a single party in opposition to the federal 
ists, the strength of the present administration is continually 
increasing. It has obtained and preserves an irresistible pre- 
ponderancy in thirteen of the sixteen state legislatures, and 
the resistance in the three others scarcely maintains its

Adams, History, I. 322.

ground. In both Houses of Congress the majority is already 
decisive, but at the ensuing Congress will be much greater. 
The division in the Senate is now nearly equal, but for the 
next two years there will be nearly two-thirds of the partisans 
of the present government. In the State of Pennsylvania 
their ascendency is so great that the federalists have scarcely 
dared to name a candidate in opposition to Governor 
M Kean s reelection. Federalism is, indeed, in that state so 
completely palsied, that scarce a trace of it is to be discov 
ered, except in here and there a newspaper edited by New 
Englandmen. 

This party triumph is not enjoyed with moderation. The 
basis of it all is democratic popularity, and the leaders are all 
sensible how sandy a foundation it is. Strong as the fabric 
of their power appears, they are constantly trembling lest its 
corner stones should fail, and as their principal alarm is lest 
the old administration should recover favor in the eyes of the 
people, the great engine of party with which they endeavor 
to fortify themselves is slander upon their predecessors. This 
they continue under every shape and on all occasions. Nor 
are these exertions unsuccessful. They carried the system to 
such a pitch that even a committee of the national House of 
Representatives, called a Committee of Investigation, at the 
close of the session made a report, the manner and form of 
which were both highly exceptionable to every maxim of 
common justice and honor. This report was hurried through 
the House with as little regard to decorum as it was made. 
It has since been analyzed and refuted by several publica 
tions in various parts of the Union, but most effectually by a 
pamphlet of Mr. Wolcott, which will doubtless be sent you 
by some of your friends, and which will show you a fair speci 
men both of our administration and its opposition. 1

The concern of the republicans, as they style themselves, 
is the result of consciousness rather than of real danger. The 
power of the administration rests upon the support of a much 
stronger majority of the people throughout the Union than 
the former administrations ever possessed since the first 
establishment of the Constitution. Whatever the merits or 
demerits of the former administrations may have been, 
there never was a system of measures more completely and 
irrevocably abandoned and rejected by the popular voice. 
It never can and never will be revived. The experiment, such 
as it was, has failed, and to attempt its restoration would be 
as absurd as to undertake the resurrection of a carcase seven 
years in its grave. The alarm of the pilots at the helm is 
therefore without cause. What they take for breakers are 
mere clouds of unsubstantial vapor. The only risk to which 
they are exposed is the shallowness of their waters. Their 
system is so short-sighted and so contracted, that it will 
never stand a popular test even of twelve years, and the 
people, whom almost unbounded prosperity could not attach 
to their predecessors, will not learn from adversity to be 
better pleased with them. 

The yellow fever made its appearance at an earlier period 
than usual in many of our cities. It has not hitherto spread 
so extensively as upon former occasions, but it has been as 
malignant in the cases which have happened as it was ever 
known. A dysentery of extreme violence has likewise pre 
vailed in the western parts of this Commonwealth and the 
neighboring part of Connecticut. The approach of the win 
ter season gives us hopes of relief from these scourges. But 
the summer has been so long protracted that, at the moment

ECCE ITERUM * 

1801, September, I returned from a series of diplomatic 
missions in Europe, which had kept me seven years absent 
from my country. Mr. Jefferson had just ascended the 
presidential chair. In December I resumed my residence 
in Boston, and became again a candidate for practice at the 
bar. 

1802, April, I was elected a member of the Senate of 
Massachusetts, in which capacity I served a single year. It 
was the noviciate of my legislative labors, during which I 
was not able either to effect much good, or to prevent much 
evil. I attempted some reforms, and aspired to check some 
abuses, I regret to say with little success. I wanted the au 
thority of experience, and I discovered the danger of oppos 
ing and of exposing corruption. I witnessed the process of a 
bank manufactory, not unlike that of the Chemical Bank, 2 
which has so recently edified the public ear at Albany. I 
resisted it in vain. The mammon of unrighteousness was 
too strongly befriended. 

In November of this year I was run as a candidate for the 
House of Representatives of the United States, in opposition 
to Dr. Eustis. 3 I had a majority of votes in Boston; but two 
or three neighboring towns annexed to the Congressional 
district and a rainy day lost me the election by forty or fifty 
votes.

During the year 1802 I delivered two orations, which 
formed no inconsiderable incidents in the history of my life. 
The first was in May, an Address to the Massachusetts 
Charitable Fire Society; J the second, at Plymouth, on the 
22d of December, at the festival of the Pilgrims. 2 The ad- 
xlress to the Fire Society has contributed to rebuild the city 
of Boston, to convert stubble into brick, clapboards and 
shingles into granite walls. It implored and shamed the Bos- 
tonians out of their inveterate fondness for wooden houses. 
If you will know the good that I have done, set this down for 
one of the best deeds of my life. In the Plymouth discourse, 
there is a brief argument upon the right of Europeans to form 
establishments in the American wilderness, and to extinguish 
upon just and reasonable terms all the natural rights of the 
aboriginal Indians conflicting with it, which was afterward 
useful to me at Ghent, and which after the lapse of more 
than twenty years I stifl: think unanswerable. 3

I o clock, P. M. 
DEAR SIR: 

I have but this moment arrived in town, and upon reach 
ing my house received your favor of yesterday. This must 
be my apology for not having sooner answered it. 

The following is a copy of the reasons for which I dissented 
from the vote for an address to remove the two judges. 1 

First. Because the grounds alleged in the said address for the 
removal are for official misdemeanors; and the subscriber con 
ceives it to be the intention of the Constitution, that no judicial 
officer should be removed from office, by the mode of an address of 
the two houses, on the ground of offences, for the trial of which the 
Constitution has expressly provided the mode of impeachment. 

Secondly. Because he considers the independence of the judi 
ciary as materially affected, by a mode of proceeding which in its 
effects must make the tenure of all judicial offices dependent upon 
the verdict of a jury in any one county of the Commonwealth. 

Thirdly. Because the decision of the Senate in this case, affecting 
in the highest degree the rights, the character and reputation of 
two individuals, citizens of this Commonwealth, ought not to 
have been taken, without giving them an opportunity previously 
to be heard in their own defence. 

I am with the highest respect, etc.

i8o 3 J JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 13 

TO ROBERT BIRD 

BOSTON, 27 April, 1803. 
SIR: 

I have received your favor of the 12 and 15 April, inclosing 
a copy of resolutions agreed upon I March, by the creditors 
of Messrs. Bird, Savage and Bird in London. I have also 
received letters from them requesting me to sign the letter 
of license at New York. Mr. King, Mr. Gore and Mr. 
Samuel Williams agreed to take up for my honor all the ac 
cepted bills drawn by me, excepting the one for 400 which 
had been sent back protested, before they knew I had drawn 
upon the house. Mr. Williams advanced the money, and by 
his letters calls upon me for the reimbursement of 2802:10 
sterling thus paid for me, with about 70 more charges of 
protest, commission, etc. In return for an act of kindness so 
important to me I cannot hesitate to make immediate re 
mittance to Mr. Williams, and to effect that am obliged 
to make sacrifices of property to raise the money, which, 
though much less than they would have been with the ag 
gravation of protested bills and their load of charges, are 
still of very serious concern to me. 

Under these circumstances, sir, upon being asked to sign 
a letter of license for three years, I have some reason to ex- 

1 On April i, notice had been received of the failure of the banking house of Bird, 
Savage and Bird, which had acted as fiscal agents of the United States in London, 
and had on deposit the funds coming to John Adams arising from the redemption of 
United States loans in Holland, to which he had subscribed to inspire confidence. 
Bills on London had been drawn by John Quincy Adams but were returned protested 
and he was forced to sell a part of his property to meet them. Rufus King, Christo 
pher Gore and Samuel Williams in London, and Benjamin Pickman in Boston gave 
him assistance and the bankers eventually paid their indebtedness; but the last in 
stalment was not received until after the death of John Adams, twenty-three years 
later. See Adams, Memoirs, April I, 1803. 



14 THE WRITINGS OF [1803 

pect that something should be alleged as the inducement. 
Still more reason have I to expect a more particular state 
ment of the assignment made by you of 75,000 sterling of 
the House s property to cover your own debts. I wish there 
fore for some further explanation on this point, and some 
satisfactory evidence that the assignment, which you coolly 
tell me "stands good against every act that can be done 
against it," is justifiable not only upon legal grounds, but 
on such principles that the unsecured and disregarded cred 
itors of the House may have an apology for acquiescing in it; 
and, after being informed of it, still to grant a letter of license 
and 800 sterling a year to each of the partners in England 
for collecting a remnant of probably desperate debts. I ask 
therefore : 

1. Whether the assignment of 75,000 property, which 
you consider yourself as having so effectually made, is or is 
not a part of that property which the house in London, on the 
1st of March, stated to their creditors there as effects re 
sponsible for their debts? 

2. If so: whether the creditors in London, when they 
agreed to the letter of license, knew of this assignment made 
by you? 

3. Whether there is any prospect that those creditors will 
not consider as void their letter of license, when they come to 
be informed of this enormous deduction from the house s 
ostensible effects? 

4. What shipments those are which you say you made to 
aid the credit of the house? When they were made? Had 
they been received and disposed of by the house in London 
before the 7th of February, or were they to arrive after that 
period? What goods were they, and to what amount will 
they probably ever be effects to satisfy the creditors of the 
house in England? 



i8o 3 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 15 

Until these questions can be satisfactorily answered I see 
no possible excuse to myself for assenting to the letter of li 
cense. The house in England write me, indeed, that it is 
the only possible way of rendering their estate solvent; but 
why it should have that tendency more than a mode of pro 
ceeding which will leave the creditors in general free to con 
test partial conveyances and assignments confessedly made 
in contemplation of failure as well as all existing attachments, 
I do not clearly see. If you can explain it to me, sir, I shall 
have no disposition to treat you or the house with severity; 
however severely they have treated me. 

I am, &c. 



TO WILLIAM BARTLETT 

BOSTON, 13 May, 1803, 



SIR: 



You will see what answers he * makes to these questions, 
and will judge for yourself concerning them. My impres 
sions are these: 

1. That his aversion, and that of his partners in England, 
to going through a commission of bankruptcy is, because 
they wish not to have the validity of their conveyances 
undergo a trial. 

2. That those of their creditors, whom they have at 
tempted to secure by these conveyances, have the same de 
sire to establish their validity, and of course would be ready 
enough to sign a letter of license. 

3. That probably the persons who are willing to become 
bail for Robert Bird to any amount are those very creditors, 

1 Robert Bird. 



1 6 THE WRITINGS OF [1803 

whom he has endeavored to secure, and who therefore wish 
to keep off a commission of bankruptcy. 

4. But that for these very reasons the unsecured creditors 
like you and me ought not to consent to the letter of license. 
I see no possible benefit that we can derive from leaving the 
management of their affairs in their own hands, and all the 
business to be transacted in England. On the contrary I 
think we ought to insist upon a judicial trial of the force of 
their partial conveyances, and the most advantageous way 
of doing that will be by a commission of bankruptcy. For 
then the assignee under the commission would try the ques 
tion at the expense of their estate, as it ought to be tried, and 
not at the cost of you or me, single individual creditors, and 
additional aggravations to our losses. 

If you concur in opinion with me as at present advised, we 
shall not sign the letter of license, and we shall instruct 
Mr. Williams not to sign it for us in England; unless, which 
I now deem next to impossible, he should see a fair prospect of 
a speedy and considerable dividend. 

We shall as soon as possible get a commission of bank 
ruptcy at New York against Bird, Savage and Bird, and 
under that commission try the validity both of Robert 
Bird s partial conveyances, and of those made by the house 
in London, at least so far as relates to debts due them here 
in the United States. For you will remark that in one in 
stance at least, the house in London have made a conveyance 
to one set of favored creditors, of the very same property 
which Robert Bird has attempted to convey to another. It 
is obvious that both these conveyances cannot stand; I hope 
that both will fall, and that whatever is recoverable will go to 
satisfy the creditors proportionably. 

Please to return me the inclosed letter as soon as possible, 
and let me know your sentiments concerning it. I shall 



i8o 3 I JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 17 

write further to Robert Bird and get a list of his unsecured 
creditors, whose interest is the same with your s and mine, 
that we may act in concert and endeavor to agree upon com 
mon measures. 
I am, &c.

BOSTON, 13 May, 1803. 
SIR: 

I have received your favor of the 5th instant, the contents 
of which are not perfectly intelligible to me, but which has 
in some respects answered the questions contained in my 
letter of 27 April. I have now to request information, when 
your creditors will be called together at New York to deter 
mine what they will do, as to the letter of license agreed to 
by some of the creditors in England. It is my intention, if 
possible, to be present at that meeting. I have also to re 
quest of you information on the following points : 

1. Whether there were any other partners, general or 
special, to the house in England, excepting yourself your 
brother Henry, and Mr. Savage? And if there were any such 
other partners who were they? 

2. Who were the persons constituting the firm of Robert 
Bird and Company at New York? Please to name every 
person included in this partnership. 

3. I will thank you for a list of your creditors in the United 
States, distinguishing the creditors of Bird, Savage and Bird 
from those of Robert Bird and Company, and specifying 
those whom you consider as secured by your assignment to 
Mr. Harrison, from those who have no security at all. 

4. At whose suit besides that of the United States are you 
now under bail, and who is that bail? You say that you can 



i8 THE WRITINGS OF [1803 

find protection so far as bail goes for any suit which may be 
commenced against you; I wish therefore to be informed who 
gives that protection, and particularly whether any of the 
creditors for whose benefit you made the assignment to 
Mr. Harrison are of the number? 

I presume, sir, that you will not consider any of these 
questions improper, that you will think them all entitled to 
clear and explicit answers, and that you will favor me with 
such an answer as soon as possible. 

You are sensible it must be my very sincere and cordial 
wish, that your opinion and that of your partners in England, 
so confidently expressed, with regard to your ultimate com 
plete solvency may prove well founded. But my confidence 
in your assurances would I confess be more unshaken, did I 
not perceive the extreme variance between your statement 
here, and that of your partners there. When I find you 
adding above 250,000 dollars to what they call the sum total 
of their debts, and deducting 75,000 sterling from what they 
exhibited as effects; when I see them exhibiting you as debtor 
to them for nearly 20,000 sterling, and you conveying away 
their effects to the amount of 75,000 more, my only aston 
ishment is that you, aware of these facts, should still be 
talking to your creditors about paying them all, and having 
a large surplus left. For my own part, I should consider an 
impartial and candid equalization of regard for the interests 
of all your creditors in their just proportions as more credit 
able to you personally, and more conformable to the dictates 
of justice, than a stubborn adherence to a system of favorit 
ism in your payments, colored only to the other creditors 
by the notoriously groundless pretence of paying them all. 

It is still in your power, sir, to manifest that equal regard 
to all your creditors, and I hope that upon reflection you will 
think it advisable to adopt that course. When I have

reason to believe you have adopted it, you shall not find me 
disposed to utter an expression which can wound your feel 
ings, or take a measure that can bear hard upon your char 
acter or interest. I am, &C. 1 



RESOLUTION ON BOUNDARIES 

[November, 1803.] 

Resolved, two thirds of the Senators present concurring therein, 
that they do consent to and advise the President of the United 
States to ratify the Convention between the United States of 
America and his Britannic Majesty for determining boundaries 
pursuant to the provisions contained in the Treaty of Peace of 
1783, concluded at London on the I2th of May, 1803, on condition 
that at the exchange of ratifications it shall be declared by the 
people authorized on the part of the United States to make the 
said exchange, that it is understood that nothing in the said Con 
vention contained shall in any manner affect or impair any right 
or claim to territory which the United States may possess, by 
virtue of the Treaty between the United States and the French 
Republic, concluded at Paris on the 3Oth of April, i8o3. 2 

RESOLUTION ON TREATY WITH FRANCE 

November 25, 1803. 
On motion, by Mr. Adams, that it be 
Resolved, that a committee of members be appointed 

1 The President called the Senate to assemble October 17, and Adams set out for 
Washington October i, but was delayed on the journey by an accidental illness in 
his family, and reached the capital city four days late. On entering the city he 
passed the Secretary of the Senate (Otis), who was taking to the President the 
Senate s advice and consent to the ratification of the treaty with France ceding 
Louisiana to the United States. Adams would have voted in its favor had he been 
present. Adams, New England Federalism, 53.

AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION 

[November 25, 1803.] 

Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States, two thirds of both Houses concurring, that the 
following amendment to the Constitution of the United States 
be proposed to the legislatures of the several States; which, when 
adopted and ratified by three-fourths of the said legislatures, shall 
be valid to all intents and purposes as a part of the said Constitu 
tion. 

Congress shall have power, at such times and in such manner as

"The speech of Mr. John Q. Adams, son of the late President, is peculiarly grati 
fying; he is an eastern man, as may be supposed not much in love with Mr. Jeffer 
son, yet he tells us the acquisition of Louisiana is an event of such great importance 
that to be able to fulfil the treaty an amendment of the constitution ought to be 
made, if necessary, and he declared his belief that every state in the union would be in 
favor of it. This cannot be called democratic cant or such like, it is the language of 
the son of Mr. Adams, and probably such as our late President himself would ex 
press. Again, speaking of the acquisition, he said: 

I consider the object as of the highest advantage to us: and the gentleman from Ken 
tucky himself, who has displayed with so much eloquence the immense importance to 
this union of the possession of the ceded country, cannot carry his idea further on that 
subject than I do? 

"Such language, we repeat, is gratifying, coming from a high New England fed 
eralist, it will have more weight than columns of the declamation of the Essex-junto.

fected, and we hope to find even among federalists no opposers to what the well in

WASHINGTON, December [3?], 1803. 
SIR: 

Some difficulty having arisen in the Senate, in considering 
the expediency of advising and consenting to the ratification 
of the Treaty of limits, between the United States and Great 
Britain, signed on the I2th of May, 1803, a committee of that

the action which was taken subsequently. In the same work he shows the effect of 
the Louisiana purchase upon the federalists of the Essex-junto following. See 
especially p. 52. 

"Mr. Adams had not arrived when the treaty [for purchase of Louisiana] was 
ratified, but he approved of it and of the consequent appropriation for the purchase- 
money; fondly believing that an amendment to the Constitution, to embrace that 
new object, would have been a mighty easy thing. He presented a resolution really 
for that purpose; but after lying some time, it was called up and was contemp 
tuously rejected; his own, Mr. Hillhouse s and mine being the only votes in its 
favor." Pickering to Rufus King, March 3, 1804, Life and Correspondence of Rufus 
King, IV. 3 6l.

body has been appointed to inquire and report upon the 
subject. 

The difficulty arises from the circumstance that the 
Treaty with the French republic, containing the cession of 
Louisiana, was signed on the 3Oth of April, twelve days earlier 
than that with Great Britain, and some apprehension is 
entertained that the boundary line contemplated in the third 
article of the latter, may by a possible future construction 
be pretended to operate as a limitation to the claims of terri 
tory acquired by the United States in the former of these in 
struments. 

But as the ratification, if it can be effected, without un 
necessary delay is a desirable object, it has occurred to the 
committee that Mr. King may possibly have it in his power 
to give information which might remove the obstacle; I have, 
therefore, in behalf of the committee, to ask whether from 
any information in possession of your Department, or which 
may be obtained, in such manner as you may deem ex 
pedient, it can be ascertained whether the third article of 
the treaty with Great Britain was concluded with any ref 
erence whatsoever to that with the French Republic, or with 
any right or claim which the United States have acquired by 
it. I am, etc. 1

concluded without any reference whatsoever to the treaty of cession with France."

"The Hon. John Quincy Adams will certainly be denounced and excommuni

nervous, manly, energetic, and unequivocal eulogy on the measure." Worcester

WASHINGTON, 24 December, 1803. 
SIR: 

In the Centinel of the loth instant is published a letter to 
the editor, 1 containing certain animadversions upon, and 
anticipations of my conduct, respecting the two subjects of 
the highest public importance which have been agitated in 

thereof may be immediately admitted into the Union and enjoy all the rights and 
immunities of citizens of the United States!! . . . The proposed Amendment of the 
Constitution for designating the votes of President and Vice President labors 
heavily in the Senate. Two of its members are absent, and it takes twenty-three to 
make the constitutional two-thirds. Mr. Butler (of South Carolina) a democrat, 
but who was a member of the Convention which formed the Constitution, and who 
knows the wisdom in which the provision was formed is opposed to the amendment; 
but to balance this, I am told Mr. Adams, from your state will advocate with ?.eal 
the amendment!!! But for this, those who count numbers say, there would not be 
a constitutional majority for the proposition." Columbian Centinel, December 10, 
1803. 

1 "I have seen the National Intelligencer for a few weeks past. I there read the 
debate which I presume was the cause of Mr. Eustis writing to Mr. Joseph Hall the 
following: You will probably have heard of the bold and independent manner in 
which J. Q. A. voted away from his party. Having gained credit with us, it is to be 
expected he will proportionably lose with them. When I wrote you last Sunday 
I did not mention this in my letter. I only observed that I was sure you would as 
much as possible keep your mind free from party influence, and vote as your con 
science aided by your judgment should dictate; and though upon some occasions 
I might think your vote would have been different, it is impossible to judge accur 
ately, because we see not the causes which have operated towards the decision. I 
did not, however, so soon expect to see Dr. Eustis observation verified. You will 
read in Ben Russell s Centinel of Saturday the loth an extract of a letter from 
Washington to the Editor. Who the writer is, I know not; but the letter is evidently 
intended to convey an idea that you were attaching yourself to the majority, and 
with the notes of admiration and the Latin quotation (I do not like this) stabbing 
in the dark, which Russell publishes, but takes care to omit the debate which gave 
occasion to the motion. You will proceed in a consistent uniform (tenor of conduct) 
regardless of the goads and stings you will have to encounter." Abigail Adams to

Congress this session. To the remarks respecting me which 
may appear in newspapers of some descriptions I should pay 
little attention. To those which appear in the Centinel, when 
of the nature of those to which I allude, some notice, in jus 
tice not only to myself but to my constituents, is due. 

In the present instance as I believe neither the writer nor 
the publisher of the letter acted with views unfriendly to me, 
and as I feel the great importance of harmony between those 
of us who generally agree in principles relative to public 
measures, I am unwilling to give publicity to the defence 
and justification of myself, which the letter I speak of seems 
to call for. It will be much more agreeable to me to explain 
myself amicably with the writer of the letter, and arrest the 
possibility of any public controversy upon the subject. I 
now, therefore, write to request information of you, who the 
writer of that letter or of the part of it respecting me was; and 
to desire particularly that you will not refuse me his name 
until after consulting him upon the subject. 1 As I presume 
it came from no ordinary authority, I flatter myself the 
gentleman will readily consent to my request, in which case 
I shall avoid all public notice of the letter. If, however, he 
should be unwilling to give his name, you will be kind 
enough to inform me of his determination. 

In asking this, I hope you will not understand me as in the 
remotest degree wishing to restrain you in the publication of 
any observations upon my conduct, which you may think 
proper at any time. I have the most perfect respect for the 
freedom of the press, and think the true spirit of independ

A motion was made by Mr. Adams, that the following resolu

Resolved, That the people of the United States, have never, 
in any manner delegated to this Senate, the power of giving its 
legislative concurrence to any act for imposing taxes upon the 
inhabitants of Louisiana, without their consent. 

Resolved, That by concurring in any act of legislation for im 
posing taxes upon the inhabitants of Louisiana without their con 
sent, this Senate would assume a power, unwarranted by the con 
stitution and dangerous to the liberties of the people of the United 
States.

NOTES OF SPEECH ON MOTION 

When the resolution to appoint a committee for the purpose of 
preparing a form or forms of government for Louisiana was first 
before the Senate, I objected against it as premature. I did not 
think it possible that during the present session of Congress we 
should obtain the knowledge or information absolutely necessary 
to proceed advisedly in a career of such vast importance. It was 
my opinion that our first and most urgent care should be to obtain 
for Congress the powers indispensable for the performance of our 
own engagements, and that we should have ample leisure for the ex 
ertion of our power over the country we have newly acquired. To 
perform what we had promised was in my view of things the task 
of most immediate pressure before us, while we could not wield 
with too prudent and wary hand the rod of empire and dominion 
which we had assumed over a foreign people. On both these 
cardinal points of policy I had the misfortune to find myself in a 
very small minority. The principles adopted by the majority of 
the Senate were in both instances the reverse of those with which 
I concurred. It was said that my anxiety for the fulfilment of 
our national engagements was overweaning and premature. That 
it was better policy to follow the example which the union had 
exhibited under the old confederacy and break the treaty without

1804; New England Federalism, 158. 



1804] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 27 

scruple, until the power with whom we made it should call us to 
account for the breach. But on the other hand the ardor for legis 
lating amply compensated for the coolness of punctuality, and, 
even before we knew whether peaceable possession of the country 
had been obtained, it was judged not too early to prepare forms of 
government for a people whose language we do not understand, 
whose manners opinions and prejudices are totally variant from 
our own, and of whom we know nothing more than could be 
collected from a couple of small pamphlets, compiled indeed with 
laudable industry and care from the little information our Execu 
tive government had been able in the course of three or four 
months to obtain, but sent to us with an express caution not to 
rely upon them as official. 

In both these decisions of the Senate it was my duty to acquiesce. 
The Committee to prepare a form or forms of Government for 
Louisiana was appointed and their report is now the subject of 
consideration. 



My first objection against this bill is derived from the principle 
upon which I opposed the appointment of the Committee. If ever 
there was an occasion upon which a legislative assembly ought to 
adopt as the basis of their measures the old and wholesome adage 
festina lente, it must surely be when they are about to undertake 
the task which the acquisition of Louisiana has imposed upon us. 
In order to impress our minds with the full conviction of this truth, 
let us seriously contemplate the extent and nature of that task. 
It is nothing less than to accomplish a total revolution, not only 
of government and laws, but of the principles upon which they are 
founded; over a people consisting of an hundred thousand souls; 
over a people of whom we may yet be said to know nothing, as 
they with still less exception know nothing of us; over a people 
whose subjection to our authority has been established without 
their previous consent, and whose liberty, property and religion, we 
are bound by solemn obligation to protect. 

In order to effect this revolution without violence and oppression, 



28 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

it must be done by slow, gradual and well considered measures; and 
it is of primary importance to lay the foundations upon proper 
principles. The first step we should take, therefore, seems to be, 
that of legitimating our authority of acquiring the right to make 
laws for that people at all. By the treaty with France we have 
acquired all the rights of sovereignty over the inhabitants of 
Louisiana which France could impart; but as, to use the language 
of our declaration of independence, the just powers of a govern 
ment can be derived only from the consent of the governed, the 
French Republic could not give us the right to make laws for the 
people of Louisiana, without their acquiescence in the transfer. 
I never considered this as an objection against the ratification of 
the treaty, because I did not deem it indispensable that this con 
sent of the ceded people should precede the conclusion of the com 
pact. That would indeed have been the most natural and most 
eligible course of proceeding, had it been practicable, and such was 
the opinion of our own executive before the negotiation of the 
treaty. But theoretic principles of government can never be 
carried into practice to their full extent. They must be modified 
and accommodated to the situations and circumstances of human 
events and human concerns. But between those allowances 
necessary to reconcile the rigor of principle with the resistance of 
practice, and the total sacrifice of all principle, there is a wide 
difference. If in the Louisiana negotiation our government had 
insisted on obtaining the consent of the people before the con 
clusion of the treaty, in all probability the treaty itself never could 
have been concluded. A momentary departure from the inflexible 
rigor of theory was, therefore, perfectly justifiable, and in con 
cluding the treaty we acquired a power over the territory and over 
the inhabitants which requires, so far as relates to the latter, one 
thing more to make it a just and lawful power. I mean their own 
consent. For although the necessity of the case might excuse us 
for not having obtained this consent beforehand, it could not 
absolve us from the obligation to acquire it afterwards. And as 
nothing but necessity can justify even a momentary departure 



1804] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 29 

from those principles which we hold as the most sacred laws of 
nature and of nations, so nothing can justify extending the de 
parture beyond the bounds of the necessity. From the instant 
when that ceases the principle returns in all its force, and every 
further violation of it is error and crime. 

If any gentleman can controvert the principle that by the laws 
of nature, of nations and of God, no people has the right to make 
laws for another people without their consent unless it be by right of 
conquest, I shall be glad to hear him; and if he can furnish to my 
unbiassed reason an apology for lending my hand to make a single 
law for the people of Louisiana without their consent, expressed 
or implied, I will not only vote for any proper law that may be 
proposed, but confess myself under deep obligation to the gentle 
man who shall solve my scruples. As to the right of conquest it 
must be out of the question. We can have no right of conquest 
over a people who have never injured us. The law of conquest is 
a law of slavery, and the people of Louisiana whose liberty we 
are solemnly bound to protect are not slaves. 

In support of this principle I have already quoted the highest 
possible authority for an American citizen; I mean, the Declaration 
of Independence. Is that not sufficient? What says the Consti 
tution under which we act? "We the people, &c. for ourselves and 
our posterity for the United States of America." Not for the 
people of Louisiana nor for any other people. The people of the 
United States knew they had no right to exercise or to delegate 
the powers of legislation over another nation, and they expressly 
limited the operations of the Constitution to the United States of 
America, to themselves and their posterity. 



The objections which I have urged hitherto against the passage 
of this bill have been either to particular details, or to points of 
expediency and considerations of justice and equity. Powerful 
as those are to my mind they are, however, of an order inferior to 
that which I now feel it my duty to make. I cannot prevail upon 
myself to vote for a law with a clear and undoubting conviction 



30 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

of my own mind that Congress have not the shadow of a right to 
pass it. Such is my conviction with regard to the act upon which 
we are now to decide. I long indulged the hope that the discussion 
of this question would have been avoided, that no alteration in the 
laws, and more especially no attempt to tax the people of Louis 
iana, would have been made, until in some shape or other their 
formal assent to our authority and acquiescence to our jurisdiction 
should have been obtained. I have been disappointed and we 
are now called upon at one and the same time to make a Constitu 
tion of government for a people who have never recognized our 
supremacy over them, and to tax for our ozvn benefit a people of 
strangers, without admitting them to representation and without 
asking their consent. 

The act upon which we are now to vote is an act to tax and very 
heavily to tax the people of Louisiana without their consent. 
This I apprehend Congress have no right to do. 

1. Because it violates the natural rights of the people. 

2. Because it violates the third Article of the Treaty of cession. 

3. Because no such authority was or could be delegated by the 

Constitution. 

4. Because it violates the principle of our national independence. 

5. It violates the natural rights of the people of Louisiana. 1

WASHINGTON, 21 January, 1804. 
DEAR SIR: 

Since I wrote you last, I have endeavored to ascertain by 
inquiry upon which I could depend the counsel best qualified 
to do justice to your cause, 1 who will probably attend here 
at the approaching session of the Supreme Court of the 
United States. The result of this inquiry has been the inten 
tion to fix upon Luther Martin, Esquire, of Baltimore, a 
gentleman whose general professional eminence, as well as 
his particular familiarity with causes of a commercial nature, 
are universally recognized by those who have had the means 
of knowing him. But as there will be still time for me to 
receive your answer to this before the sitting of the Court, if 
this choice should not be satisfactory to you or the gentleman 
concerned, please to give me notice of it, and I will employ 
some other. 

As you have authorized me to draw upon you for his fees, 
as well as my own, I will thank you for instructions respect 
ing the amount of those you would choose to give the coun 
sel I shall employ. As for my own I wish you to have as little 
solicitude as I have myself, but I presume you are aware the 
customary fees of counsel here are higher than in Boston. 
Upon inquiring here what would be proper, I have deter 
mined to give Mr. Martin 100 dollars on employing him. I 
presume he will expect a further compensation should the 
cause come to trial. But being desirous not to exceed your 
own intentions in these respects, I will be obliged to you to 
let me know them. 

I find by inquiry of the Clerk of the Supreme Court that

the papers on the appeal have not yet been received at his 
office. Your letter, however, has very clearly opened the 
points made by the plaintiff at the trial in Boston. If you 
can conveniently procure and forward to me copies of the 
papers in the Circuit Court, it will enable me to understand 
more fully the case, and to explain it to the gentleman I shall 
engage for you in time to be prepared for a trial at this term. 
The appellant must of course send up the papers. But per 
haps they may not come until the court will be in session, 
and even then we shall want copies of them taken here. For 
the clerk of the Court allows no papers to go out of his office. 1

WASHINGTON, 6 March, 1804. 
DEAR SIR: 

I am sorry that it is not in my power to inform you that 
the judgment of the Circuit Court in the case of Church v. 
Hubbart is affirmed. The cause was argued last week by 
Mr. Stockton and Mr. Martin on the part of Mr. Church 2 
(I found Mr. Martin on his arrival here engaged for Mr. 
Church,) and by Mr. J. T. Mason 3 of this place and myself 
for Mr. Hubbart. The Supreme Court have reversed the 
judgment of the Circuit Court on the sole ground that the 
Portuguese papers were not duly authenticated. 

On the main question of the cause, however, which was 
also fully argued, the Court are decidedly of opinion that,

supposing the papers properly proved, the loss came within 
the exceptions of both policies, and that the underwriters are 
not liable. The cause is remanded to the Circuit Court for 
a new trial. It will of course be necessary to send to Lisbon 
again to get the papers properly attested. I must observe 
to you, that on the record as it came up not even the original 
Portuguese papers appeared, there was nothing but Mr. Jar- 
vis s translation and certificate. The Court here held that 
if no better attestation was to be obtained, that fact should 
have been proved; that the originals, exemplified under the 
great Seal of Portugal, taken and returned under a commis 
sion issued from the Circuit Court itself where the cause was 
pending, should have been produced. These, however, will 
only occasion further delay and trouble to the underwriters. 
If Mr. Church chooses to carry the contest any further, it is 
at least certain from the opinion of this court on the merits, 
that he must eventually lose it. I would recommend to the 
underwriters to be peculiarly cautious at their next effort 
to get the papers in an unquestionable form. 
I am, &c. 



TO RUFUS GREENE AMORY 

WASHINGTON, 6 March, 1804. 

DEAR SIR: 

Immediately on receiving your letter of 21 ultimo, and 
that of Mr. Hays enclosing the newspaper to which you 
refer, I applied for the attested copy of the paper you request, 
which is promised me, and which I will send you as soon as 
it is made out. The Spanish order was not published from 
the Department of State. As your request is only for the 
order of 20 April, 1799, revoking the permission to neutrals 



34 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

to trade, I suppose you will not be desirous of a copy of a 
subsequent order, dated October the same year, and reviving 
the permission to neutrals to take away the proceeds of 
negro-cargoes, which subsequent order, I am informed at the 
State Department, is also in possession of the office. 

In this instance, as in any other in which I can be of any 
service to you, it will give me great pleasure, nor should I 
ever think of making a charge for the trouble of procuring 
you a necessary paper, or any other piece of evidence which 
you may want. It is proper, however, that you should be 
apprized, that in one action pending at the Massachusetts 
Supreme Court on one of these Plate-river voyages, I was 
last summer of counsel for the underwriters. It was the case of 
Pollock v. Babcock. I know not how far there may be dis 
tinctions between this and the two actions for which you 
want evidence, but I mention it, first, as a reason which 
would induce me to decline charging anything for any serv 
ice on the side opposed to that for which I was engaged, even 
if I thought I could fairly make a charge in such a case on any 
consideration; and secondly, that in any communications to 
me on the subject, you may be aware of the relation in which 
I stood to the questions upon these policies. 

I am, &c.

DEAR SIR: 

I received last evening your obliging favor, and have de 
liberately considered the proposal it contains. 1 I feel myself

that a concise and clear statement of the Pickering impeachment trial be prepared 
to be signed by such Senators as might desire to bear testimony against "This

much indebted to you and the other gentlemen for the com 
munication, and for the desire that I would draw up a state 
ment of the circumstances, which have attended the pro 
ceedings upon Judge Pickering s impeachment, and with 
which we have been so justly dissatisfied. 

I regret that an indisposition which confined me to the 
house this day will deprive me of the opportunity of con 
versing with you on the subject. I am not aware of any 
statement which I could draw up to be offered at the time 
you propose, that would be at once consistent with our rules 
of order, and a full exposition of our reasons to justify our 
own conduct. If the measure should not be itself perfectly 
in order, its tendency would be to produce further disorder in 
the proceedings of the court; and as irregularity of proceed 
ing is in my opinion one great error into which the court 
has been led, or rather driven, I should be anxious as much as 
possible to avoid anything which should increase this irregu 
larity, or throw any part of its blame upon those, who to the 
utmost of their power have struggled against it. Perhaps, 
however, a statement may be made which, without being 
disorderly itself, will at the same time serve as our justifica 
tion, and as our testimony against the course which has been 
pursued. If so, I shall most readily concur in it, and sub 
scribe to it. Mr. White s resolution, if permitted to remain 
on the records, will serve as justification to us; but if more 
can with propriety be done before the judgment is pro 
nounced, it shall have my hearty assent.

mockery of a trial, where not justice, but the Demon of Party, determined the pro 
ceedings." He asked Adams to prepare such a statement. See Adams, New Eng 
land Federalism, 160. Pickering s request is in Adams, Memoirs, March 12, 1804. 



36 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

TO TIMOTHY PICKERING 

WASHINGTON, n March, 1804. 
DEAR SIR: 

On further reflection since this morning, I have thought 
of a mode which appears to me not out of order, and in 
which we can express our sentiments relative to the proceed 
ings of the court. It is to decline answering the final ques 
tion, and assign the reasons, as you will see in the rough 
sketch which I inclose. If this should meet your approba 
tion and that of the other gentlemen with whom you may 
consult, I will when called upon for my vote declare that I 
cannot answer, and offer this paper in behalf of myself, and 
of the other gentlemen who please to subscribe it. If the 
paper is not suffered to be read, and we are either required 
to answer or excused, we can publish the paper, with the 
statement that it was not suffered to be read. If you would 
wish any alterations or additions, please to make them and 
send me back the paper to copy fair tonight or tomorrow 
morning. If you disapprove the plan, please keep the paper, 
and return it to me when we meet tomorrow. 
Yours faithfully. 

[INCLOSURE] 

We the subscribers, members of the Senate of the United States, 
sitting as a Court of Impeachment, upon the impeachment of 
John Pickering, Judge of the District Court, for the District of 
New Hampshire, request to be excused from answering the ques 
tion of guilty or not guilty, upon the four several Articles of Im 
peachment preferred against the said John Pickering, by the 
House of Representatives of the United States. 

And we offer the following as our reasons for declining to answer 



1804] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 37 

that question at this time. Which reasons we also request may 
be entered upon the records of the Court. 

First. Because from the allegations contained in the petition 
of Jacob S. Pickering, son of the said John Pickering, and supported 
by the depositions of Samuel Tenney, a member of the House of 
Representatives of the United States, of Annie R. Cutter, of 
Joshua Brackett, of Edward St. Loe Livermore and of George 
Sullivan, and further confirmed by circumstances within the per 
sonal knowledge of Simeon Olcott and William Plumer, two of us, 
who deposed to the same in this Court, we think there is the 
highest probability that the said John Pickering was, at the time 
when the offences alleged in the said Articles of Impeachment 
are stated to have been committed, and for some time before and 
ever since has been, and still is insane, his mind wholly deranged, 
deprived of the exercise of judgment and the faculties of reason, 
and as such incapable of committing a crime and not amenable 
for his actions to any judicial tribunal. 

Secondly. Because from the allegations contained in the said 
Jacob S. Pickering s petition, supported by some of the same de 
positions above referred to, it appears, that from the bodily in 
firmities of the said John Pickering it was not possible for him 
to have been present at the day fixed by the Court for his trial, 
without immiment danger of his life. 

Thirdly. Because conceiving impeachment for high crimes and 
misdemeanors to be a criminal prosecution, we think that upon a 
suggestion of present insanity of the person accused, supported by 
credible testimony, the Court are bound by law, at every stage of 
the same, to stay all further proceedings until the truth respecting 
the alledged fact of present insanity can be ascertained. 

Fourthly. Because all the evidence produced in support of the 
said Articles of Impeachment was taken and received ex parte, 
when neither the said John Pickering, nor any person in his behalf, 
could cross examine them, or have an opportunity to controvert 
its competency or its credibility. 

Fifthly. Because improper evidence was received against the 



3 8 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

said John Pickering when neither he, nor any person in his behalf, 
nor any member of the Court could assign reasons for objections 
against its admission. And we refer particularly to the testimony 
of Michael M Clary, of Richard Cutts Shannon and of Edward 
Hart, who were permitted and required to give their opinions and 
common report, as to the cause of the said John Pickering s insanity 
and disorders, while at the same time the opinion of his family 
physician and testimony of that opinion on the same subject, 
were excluded. 

Sixthly. Because from all these circumstances we are of opinion 
that the said John Pickering has not had the benefit of an impartial 
trial; that he has not had an opportunity or the possibility of 
being heard or defended either by himself or his counsel. And 

Seventhly. Because, although believing in the present state of the 
testimony received, that the said John Pickering is not guilty of 
the charges alleged against him in the said four Articles of Im 
peachment, we have not had either the time or the means which 
we conceive necessary and proper for ascertaining the facts, so as 
to enable us to pronounce his acquittal. 1 

TO LOUISA CATHERINE ADAMS 

QUINCY, 25 May, 1804. 

As to Madame de Stael s opinions upon the subject of 
divorce and the marriage vow, they are such as might be 
expected from her history and her character. After having 
sacrificed all decency as well as all virtue in her own conduct, 
it is natural enough to find her torturing her ingenuity to 
give Infamy itself a wash of plausibility. It is one of the wise 
discoveries of the French Revolution that the marriage vow 
is absurd, because it promises love for life, which, say they, 
is promising what is not within our own power. I remember 

1 This paper was not acceptable to Pickering. 



1804] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 39 

that when the great regenerating French National Conven 
tion passed their law to make divorce just as easy as marriage, 
this was the decisive and triumphant argument with them. 
Yet the very same men, who could not promise to love any 
thing for life, unanimously took within a week afterwards an 
oath of eternal hatred to monarchy. They could vow to hate, 
not to love. Their objection, however, is not true. Honest 
and virtuous minds can promise to love for life, and can per 
form the promise. Thousands and thousands of examples 
prove it. But when the heart has long been wallowing in the 
kennels of corruption, it infects the understanding and pre 
vails upon it to make common cause. 

I have been amusing my leisure with the writings of a 
French woman of another age and a different character. I 
mean with the letters of Madame de Sevigne, of which I had 
read some volumes heretofore. She lived at a time when the 
morals of high life at the court of France were not very rigor 
ous, but her own conduct was always exemplary. Her letters 
are full of wit and playfulness, but they are at the same time 
replete with honorable sentiments, with pleasing description, 
with characters sketched at a glance; with infinite variety of 
anecdotes, made to entertain by the manner in which they 
are told, even when of the most inconsiderable nature in 
themselves. 



TO LOUISA CATHERINE ADAMS 

QUINCY, 17 June, 1804. 

Our state legislature have had some very animated debates 
within the last ten days. If you read the Boston papers you 
may have remarked the answer of the Senate to the Cover- 



4 o THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

nor s speech. 1 I believe Quincy drew it up. It contains some 
remarks which stirred the blood of several gentlemen, who 
thought that every censure upon political hypocrites and im 
postors must of course be meant for them. They attacked it 
with no small violence, but without success. 

Then came on a question about the manner of choosing 
electors for President and Vice President, whether by dis 
tricts or by a general ticket. The latter was adopted after 
long and bitter opposition, among the supporters of which 
Mr. [Perez] Morton has made himself very conspicuous. 

Last of all they have begun to carve out work for their 
Senators in Congress. A motion has passed the House of 
Representatives, 2 and either has or probably will go through 
the Senate to instruct the Senators of the state in the national 
legislature to use their endeavors for obtaining an amend 
ment to the Constitution of the United States, whereby the 
representation of slaves shall be done away. All this I know 
only by hearsay and the newspapers, for I have not been 
near Boston since the General Court met. . . . 3 



TO LOUISA CATHERINE ADAMS 

QUINCY, 13 July, 1804. 

I had seen in some newspaper an account of one incendiary 
attempt at Mount Vernon, but am surprised that it should 
so often have been repeated without detection. 4 We have

4 "There have been five attempts made to destroy Mount Vernon. Mrs. Wash 
ington dare not sleep there when Mr. Washington is from home. A few days since 



1804] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 41 

just now seen published the famous charge of Judge Bowen 
to a grand jury in Georgia, which you will find in some of the 
papers. 1 I think it to the credit of the Georgia people that 
they suffered him to get away with a whole skin. For al 
though there is nothing more strong as to principle in the 
charge, than Mr. Jefferson himself has published in his Notes 
on Virginia, yet Bowen went one step further. He drew the 
inference from the theory, and then the madness of the doc 
trines appeared in full view. 

I wish the report you have heard, that Mr. W. Pinkney, 
on his return to this country, is to be appointed Attorney 
General, may prove to be well-founded, but I suspect Mr. 
Lincoln will not so readily loosen his hold of the place. It 
seems the successor to Mr. Livingston at the Imperial Court 
of France is to be General Armstrong, and General Smith 
must yet content his ambition with being uncle-in-law to his 
imperial highness, the Arch Duke Jerome. This much for 
liberty, equality, fraternity, French Republics, one and in 
divisible, and the unalienable rights of man. 

TO LOUISA CATHERINE ADAMS 

QUINCY, 19 July, 1804. 

Conversation now can scarcely turn upon any other sub 
ject than the late horrible duel at New York. The circum- 

a servant went into the cellar for something in the evening, and found it in a blaze. 
They put it out with difficulty and on searching the cellar discovered a barrel filled 
with tar shavings, etc., prepared to set fire to. The gardener, an Irishman, is sup 
posed to have done it, and has been confined in consequence; but this last attempt 
has been made since his confinement." Louisa Catherine Adams to John Quincy

stances which led to it, and the manner in which it was con 
ducted, are as yet very imperfectly known; but I cannot 
conceive any possible circumstances which can justify the 
conduct of Mr. Burr, either preceding the fatal day, or im 
mediately subsequent to it. His principal aim appears to 
have been to make a display of indifference and unconcern, 
and this he did in a manner which in its fairest light can only&gt; 
be considered as an excess of affectation. 

22 July, 1804. 

We have now seen the correspondence between Mr. Burr 
and General Hamilton which led to their fatal meeting, and 
I am fully confirmed in the opinion I had entertained of the 
transaction before. Mr. Burr began by making a demand of 
General Hamilton which he must *have known Hamilton 
could not, and ought not to answer. To make the matter 
more sure he couched the demand in terms at which a much 
cooler man than Hamilton must have spurned. The sub 
stance was so vague and indefinite, as to render impossible 
the very avowal or disavowal it affected to require. The 
form was studied to provoke and insult, by an assumption 
of superiority which a man of spirit could not submit to. 
Hamilton saw through the artifice, and yet had not a suffi 
cient control over his own passions, or a sufficient elevation 
over the prejudices of the world to parry it. Had he omitted 
half a line in his first answer which must be considered as in 
viting a challenge, I see nothing on his part of the corre 
spondence against which any reasonable objection can be 
raised. The conduct of Mr. Burr through the whole affair 
appears to me strongly to corroborate that opinion of his 
character which his enemies have long ascribed to him. 1

"On Thursday (the day before yesterday) there was a funereal procession and an 



1804] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 43 

You remember they used to joke at Berlin about Prince 
Louis (Bonaparte), but in sober sadness it has come to the 
same thing. This is the turn of one tire more in the wheel 
of the French Revolution, but it has not yet got completely 
round. Poor Jerome, who is so cavalierly left out of the line 
of aggrandizement and succession, must be content to sing 
to the tune of "All for Love, or the world well lost." And 
well lost in my opinion it really will be for him. I have been 
told, however, that in his marriage articles there is an express 
provision-made for the possible case of his getting sick of his 
bargain and casting off the lady a stipulation which is 
equally marked with humility and with prudence on her 
part. 

As to titles, if what we see in the papers be true, the 
French are going to plunge into them with all the fondness of 
children for a new rattle. There is Imperial Majesty Joseph 
ine, Imperial Highnesses Joseph and Louis, Grand Elector, 
and High Constable, Serene Highness, Arch Chancellor Cam- 
baceres, and Arch Treasurer Lebrun, etc., etc. Was there 
ever so horrible a tragedy concluded with so ridiculous a 
farce? 

TO LOUISA CATHERINE ADAMS 

QUINCY, 23 September, 1804. 

We have had in the course of the last week a celebration of 
an unusual kind here. It is called the installation of a Lodge 

eulogium upon General Hamilton delivered in the Chapel Church at Boston, by Mr. 
Otis. I did not go to hear it; for although far from being disposed at this time to 
contest the merits of Mr. Hamilton, neither the manner of his death, nor his base 
treatment of more than one of my connections, would permit me to join in any out 
ward demonstration of regret which I could not feel at heart. Otis, as you will 
readily believe, acquitted himself very well of his performance." To Louisa Cath 
erine Adams, July 28, 1804. Ms.

of Free Masons. It was performed at the meeting house, 
with a sermon by Mr. Whitney, and a prayer by Mr. Harris, 
preceded by a Masonic procession to the house, followed by 
a Masonic dinner at the Town Hall. All of which we were 
invited by the lodge to attend, and did attend, excepting my 
brother who was detained at home by a visit from Mr. 
Palaeska, who came up from Boston to dine with him. The 
weather was somewhat unfavorable, as during the procession 
there was a small rain that annoyed us not a little. The 
ceremonies have nothing in them very striking, but the 
house was very much crowded, and B. Russell, who per 
formed a conspicuous character as Marshall of the Royal 
Arch Lodge, has given a pompous account of the day in his 
Centinel. 

I was last evening at Mr. Quincy s to pass an evening hour, 
and as he was not nor any of his family at the celebration, I 
gave them an account of it. This naturally leading to a con 
versation on the subject of Free Masonry in general, I in 
dulged myself at some length and with great freedom on the 
nature of the institutions and its effects, until all at once it 
came out that Quincy himself was of the brotherhood. This 
incident, however, as the whole conversation had been per 
fectly good humored, contributed only to divert us, and I 
tasked him for his inexcusable neglect of attending at the 
installation. . . . 

I observe in the newspapers that somebody in London (I 
suppose it must be Dickins) has published in a volume my 
letters on Silesia, pilfered doubtless from the Port Folio. And 
to help the sale, has not only given my name, but added a 
despicable parade of rank and titles to it, which a rational 
man cannot hear thus applied without laughing. I can in 
deed as well as most people bear to be laughed at, when 
knowing the occasion to be trivial in its nature or not pro- 



1804] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 45 

ceeding from my own fault, and therefore I shall concern 
myself very little with this bookseller s device for gull- 
catching. But there was one of those letters which ought 
never to have been published at all, and would not have been 
but by accident and an inattention which I could not con 
trol. 

It contained an allusion to the domestic history of certain 
characters we met at Dresden, and having no relation what 
ever to the Silesian tour, ought never to have been published 
with it. While the letters were confined to the Port Folio 
I consoled myself that this indiscreet part of the publication 
would never reach the persons to whom it must give pain, 
and who imputing it to me would think it very ill-return for 
civilities and good-offices. Now however it appears to me 
more than probable that some "d d good-natured friend" 
will not fail to convey the obnoxious matter to those most 
affected by it, and they will think very hardly of me for it. 
It is, however, too late for a remedy. As to the publication 
itself, it will certainly not tend to place me on that point of 
literary fame to which I should aspire, if to any at all. The 
whole collection was written for my own amusement and 
that of my friends in this country, without any design for 
publication. The observations of my own, therefore, con 
tained in them are superficial, and the whole valuable matter 
is taken from the German tourists and other writers on the 
province. The credit due for all this is of a very humble 
nature indeed, and if I should ever appear voluntarily before 
the public as a candidate for the reputation of an author, 
it would be with pretensions of rather more elevation. I 
must, however, be content with things as they are. If 
Heaven should grant me life and health, I hope at some future 
day to offer something of more value to the world. But as 
yet I am only preparing myself to undertake it, and like

many other good resolutions it will perhaps never come to the 
maturity of accomplishment. . . .*

Serious Reflections, Addressed to the Citizens of Massachusetts 

No. I 3 

As the time is approaching when the People of this Common 
wealth will be called to give their suffrages for electors of President 
and Vice President of the United States, and also of members for 
the national House of Representatives, it is of importance to them 
to fix the principles which ought to govern them in their choice. 
Candidates of various descriptions and of militating political 
sentiments will be held up to their view, and recommended to 
their suffrages, by the friends of the past and the partisans of the 
present administration of the general government. It is not my 
intention to advocate or to oppose the election of any individual, 
but as a sincere friend to the interests of my country, to submit 
some observations to my fellow citizens, concerning the principles 
to which I believe their own interest directs them, for the deter- 

1 "You will see that the Spanish Marquis [Yrujo] has given great offence to our 
friend Jackson by a very courteous attempt to make him subservient to his present 
political purposes. Jackson appears not to be well versed in the profundities of 
diplomatic skill, and not at all to understand the art of filing down corruption into 
patriotism. It is, however, possible that he may have given the Marquis s pro 
posals a construction different from what was intended. He might only mean to 
obtain a vehicle for popular negotiation against the present administration among 
the federalists, such as he formerly used against their predecessors, with his worthy 
friends of that day. He was somewhat indiscreet indeed in talking about political 
intolerance, and an administration which he would not call a government, to a per 
son so much of a stranger to him as Jackson." To Louisa Catherine Adams, Sep

mination of their votes, between the several claimants to their 
favor. 

The government of the United States is to be considered in a 
two fold view: First, as an association of the people, and secondly, 
as a confederation of the States which constitute the North Amer 
ican Union. The representation of the States is in the Senate, and 
that of the people in the House of Representatives. The duties 
of the members of these respective branches of the general legis 
lature are correspondent to the stations in which they are placed. 
And consequently it behooves every senator to support and main 
tain the interests of the State by which he is delegated; as it is 
incumbent on the representatives to promote with a warm and 
honest zeal those of the people by whom he was elected. I shall 
not be understood as meaning to say that the senator of any State, 
or the representative from any section of the people, ought so 
exclusively to pursue the interests of his immediate constituents, 
as to wish that those of the whole union or of any part of it should 
be sacrificed to them; but that he should so far be devoted to 
those from whom he derives his powers, as on no consideration 
whatsoever to suffer their just interests to be sacrificed to the 
partial views and purposes of others. Addressing then the people 
of Massachusetts, I trust they will feel the force of the argument 
when I say: fellow citizens, in choosing your representatives, be 
sure to choose men who will support your own interests. Those of 
other parts of the Union, you may be assured, will be sufficiently 
represented and supported without your assistance. The people 
of Virginia will not choose Representatives who will abandon 
their interests for the sake of advancing yours; you cannot expect 
or wish that they should; let it be your care on your part to elect 
men, who shall have no bias on their minds, the tendency of which 
will be to prostrate your legitimate rights at the feet of Virginian 
policy. 

Since the first association of the United Colonies at the dawn 
of the American revolution, there never has been a time, when it 
so essentially imported to the people of Massachusetts to make 



48 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

reflections like these, and to act conformably to them. During 
the war of the revolution and the first confederation, Massachu 
setts was among the first in support of the common cause. The 
treasures and the blood of her citizens freely flowed for the benefit 
of the Union, while afflicted with the miseries of War. After the 
peace, she exhibited in an eminent degree, the same enlarged and 
liberal spirit. She readily complied with the requisitions of Con 
gress for raising funds to discharge the obligations of the public 
faith, and actually taxed herself by commercial regulations, until 
she found she was only raising rival, and less generous neighbors 
upon her own ruins. At the formation and adoption of the present, 
or rather the late national Constitution, her conciliatory spirit, 
and willingness to yield much for the general good were equally 
conspicuous. Equally conspicuous have they been during the 
administration of that government; and while she has uniformly 
borne more than her proportion of all the burdens, she has been 
content to share, at most, her equal part of the blessings derived 
from it. But neither under the old confederation, nor under the 
Constitution of 1787, had she ever, until very recently, a formid 
able party within her own bosom, whose systematic policy it was 
to make her peculiar interests a sacrifice to those of another quar 
ter of the Union. The members of her own legislature, and her 
delegations to the national councils have been Massachusetts 
men, who felt it their duty to support by all fair and honorable 
means the measures most favorable to her interests, and who 
would have thought it treachery of the deepest dye to make 
themselves the servile instruments of a policy directly hostile to 
their own constituents. Now, however, this singular phenomenon 
has appeared: and at the late session of the General Court, the 
most unequivocal proof has been exhibited, of a strong party, who 
build all their hopes of success upon the basis of unlimited devo 
tion to a system, the first feature of which is the annihilation of 
New England weight and influence in the Union. 

It is painful to be under the necessity of stating this fact. It 
is painful to remark to what extremes faction and ambition have 



1804] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 49 

already proceeded in this country. But it cannot be disguised 
and ought not to be concealed. It is possible to believe that this 
subserviency to foreign views, and this immolation of their own 
interests have reached the mass of the people. The mass of the 
people have no private and selfish purposes to answer by rec 
ommending themselves to the favor of the national executive. 
They have no offices to obtain from the removal of honest, able 
and faithful federalists. They have no reward in prospect from 
the prostration of personal or political antagonists. They therefore 
have no motive to betray themselves. If then it be made manifest 
to them, that a numerous and closely combined party of the men 
in whom they have placed their confidence have, whether from 
personal or from factious motives, surrendered themselves up 
without reserve to a political system in direct hostility to the fair 
and just interests of the people, whom they represent, the danger 
that impends will be fully disclosed, and the effectual guard against 
it will be seasonably applied. The confidence which has been 
betrayed will be transferred, from hollow professions, to solid 
merit; from fawning flattery, to honest zeal; from selfish faction, 
to pure patriotism; and Massachusetts will recover that weight and 
influence in the Union, which some of her own sons have unblush- 
ingly attempted to wrest from her. 

I am aware that assertions like these ought not to be made on 
light grounds. In the ardor of political controversy it is but too 
common to see men entertain unjust and unwarrantable suspicions 
of their adversaries, and impute to them motives, which are not 
theirs. So long as the party in this Commonwealth, in opposition 
to the present administration of its government kept within the 
bounds of decency and moderation; nay, so long as they were grati 
fied by the arts of popular courtship to blazon their own pretensions 
to favor, and to run down opponents, whose public merits and pri 
vate virtues could never suffer by comparison with their own, 
however ungenerous and censurable their procedure, its effects 
were not immediately pernicious and dangerous to their country. 
When at one of our annual periods of election, their heaviest 



50 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

engine of detraction against the governor of the Commonwealth 
was a charge of carriage hire for attendance at a funeral; when at 
another their most elaborate topic of reproach, was the rent of the 
Province House, their patriotic economies were estimated at their 
true value; their slanders were even productive of good effects, for 
when complaints like those were dwelt upon, with the choicest of 
their bitterness, the evidence was irresistible, that no reasonable 
ground for complaint existed. But when from the circulation of 
petty calumny against the governor, they proceeded to bold as 
sault upon the clearest and most important interests of the State, 
when after spending their most envenomed arrows in fruitless 
efforts against individual virtue, they selected their last shaft to 
aim at the vitals of their country, it became the duty of every real 
friend to that country to resist, and expose them. 

At the late session of the legislature three occasions happened 
when the party in opposition to the present administration of the 
Commonwealth, discovered their unqualified devotion to the in 
terests of Virginia, or rather to the views of Mr. Jefferson. The 
first was a motion for making certain additions to the answer of the 
House to the governor s speech. The object of this was personal 
adulation to the President of the United States. The second was 
the vehement opposition and indecent protests against the choice 
of electors for President and Vice President, by a general ticket. 
And the third was the struggle against the motion of Mr. Ely for 
instructing the senators of the Commonwealth in Congress, to 
propose an amendment to the national Constitution, for the pur 
pose of correcting that humiliating inequality which gives a repre 
sentation to the slave-holding Southern planters, nearly double 
to that of the Massachusetts farmer. On each of these transac 
tions I shall submit to the public remarks which will tend to 
elucidate the motives in which the conduct of the opposition party 
originated. I shall examine the arguments alleged by themselves, 
and endeavor to point out the difference between their outward 
practice and their real purposes. After the lessons of experience 
which have so recently been taught to all the republicans by the 



1804] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 51 

terrible example of the French revolution and its last catastrophe, 
the people of Massachusetts, turning an eye upon themse/.ves, have 
the deepest interest to inquire, what are the real designs of that 
party, which has always held up the revolution as the theme of 
their highest admiration and applause. 

TI 1 

When the answer of the House of Representatives of the Com 
monwealth, to the governor s speech, at the opening of the last 
session, was in debate before the House, a long panegyric upon the 
present administration of the national government was moved by 
Mr. Perez Morton, of Dorchester, to be inserted in the answer by 
way of amendment. Mr. Morton, both in the motion upon which 
I am about to remark, and in the other party measures of the ses 
sion, assumed exclusively the lead in the House of Representatives; 
the stability of his political opinions, their character and their 
tendency, are of no small importance as indications of the views 
which actuate him and his followers. 

Mr. Morton of late years has been a very ardent partisan of that 
political denomination among us who, by a manoeuvre borrowed 
from France, the prototype of all their party tactics, and suggested 
to them in the famous intercepted letter of Fauchet, the minister 
of Robespierre in this country, affect exclusively to style them 
selves republicans. 

Mr. Morton is, of course, a profound admirer of the sublime vir-, 
tues and stupendous talents of Mr. Jefferson, whose tender sym 
pathies for the French revolution have been so perfectly congenial 
with his own. This admiration he has more than once anxiously 
endeavored to communicate to the legislature of Massachusetts. 
In the January session of 1802, he labored with the burden of his 
admiration so much, that he attempted to bring it forth in the form 
of an Address to the President of the United States; and not having 
at that time any of the topics for approbation which he has now 
1 The Repertory, October 30, 1804. 



52 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

chosen to specify, he was at no loss for others equally well founded. 
At that time the principal achievements of Mr. Jefferson s ad 
ministration had been the repayment of Callender s fine; the nolle 
prosequi to screen Duane from punishment; the squandered thou 
sands upon the Eerceau; the dismission of numerous honest, capa 
ble, and faithful servants of the public, to make way for their 
counterparts of an opposite sect; and above all the comment upon 
the inaugural speech, in the answer to the merchants of New 
Haven. The destruction of the federal judiciary was resolved, but 
not then accomplished. Still Mr. Morton had no dearth of mate 
rials for his address, and could he have persuaded a majority of his 
fellow legislators to participate in his zeal, was even then, no less 
than at present, ready 

To crook the pregnant hinges of the knee, 
Where thrift might follow fawning. 

The two succeeding winters, Mr. Morton has passed at the city 
of Washington, as a humble solicitor to Mr. Jefferson and his 
administration, for simple justice in a private concern, without 
being able to obtain it. He is personally interested in what has 
been called the Yazoo purchase of Georgia lands; and has been 
employed by the other proprietors as their agent to support their 
claims upon the government of the United States. The last winter, 
after having been fed with airy promises year after year, and after 
a majority of the national House of Representatives had decided 
that these claimants ought to be indemnified, behold, Mr. John 
Randolph came out with a string of resolutions, the purpose of 
which was to declare that no such indemnity should be given; and 
Mr. Thomas Randolph, Mr. Jefferson s son-in-law, in a speech 
highly celebrated for its eloquence, the only speech he made during 
the whole session, supported the principles of his namesake. 

It was observed by Voltaire, that in his time the Parisian cour 
tiers were in the constant practice of riding post haste to Versailles, 
to receive bufferings which, post haste, they went back to return 
at Paris. Just so it appears to be with Mr. Morton. He goes 



1804] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 53 

annually to Washington, to ask justice for himself and others. He 
implores it as a favor, and it is denied; but he abates not a jot of 
heart and hope. Mr. Jefferson he knows favors his claim, though 
Mr. Jefferson s son-in-law reserves all the thunders of his eloquence 
to oppose it; another winter Mr. John Randolph s influence may 
be diminished in the House of Representatives; or perhaps his 
docility to private lessoning may become such that he will with 
draw his opposition. So Mr. Morton comes home; perseveres in 
his admiration of Mr. Jefferson, with unabating fervor, and re 
turns the buffetings he received at the federal city, in offensive 
reflections upon the majority in the Massachusetts legislature. 

Let us now turn from the man to the motion. As in the former 
we find certain sources of devotion to Mr. Jefferson and a Vir 
ginian policy, other than those of public spirit, so in the latter we 
shall find causes of admiration alleged distinguishable by a similar 
remoteness from the fountains of truth. In short, Mr. Morton 
appears to be gifted with the endowment of the great McFingal 
he sees what is not to be seen. 

The first assertion which evinces this sharpness of his optics is 
that which he has chosen to place in the front of his commenda 
tions. "That the general government, without the aid of direct 
taxes and burthensome excises, have effected an important diminu 
tion of the public debt by the appropriation of seven millions of 
dollars annually to that object." 

1. It is not true that the general government has appropriated 
seven millions of dollars annually to the diminution of the public 
debt. 

2. It is not true that the portion of the old debts of the United 
States which they have discharged was paid off by them without 
the aid of direct taxes and excise. 

3. It is not true that the general government, under the pres 
ent administration, has effected any diminution of the public 
debt. On the contrary, they have effected a very great addition 
to it. 

Here then are no less than three mistakes in point of fact com- 



54 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

mitted by Mr. Morton at the threshold of his plausive tale; mis 
takes which it is much easier for me than for him to account for 
his having committed. 

I know very well that in all the newspapers and party publica 
tions of the faction, for those two years, the falsehood has been 
perpetually repeated in the truth of detection, that seven millions 
annually were appropriated to pay off the principal of the public 
debt. It is also known that on the 29th of April, 1802, an act of 
Congress passed, the title of which affirmed that it made provision 
for the payment of the whole of the public debt; but if Mr. Morton 
in the heat of his affection for the present national order of things, 
will take upon trust newspaper falsehoods, or the titles of acts of 
Congress, he must not expect that the people of Massachusetts 
will be equally credulous or equally obsequious. 

By the act of 29th April, 1802, the annual sum of seven millions 
three hundred thousand dollars was vested in the Commissioners 
of the Sinking Fund, "to be applied by them to the payment of 
interest and charges, and to the reimbursement or redemption of 
the principal of the public debt;" and in this sum are included all 
the appropriations which had before that time been made towards 
effecting the same purpose. 

Now in the first place, appropriations had been made under the 
former administrations for the regular payment of all the interest 
and for the reimbursement of the greater part of the principal of 
the debt. The repayment, for example, of the old six per cents and 
deferred stock had been going on for years before this act of 29th 
April was made. The appropriation of seven millions then, was 
little or nothing else than renewing provisions which had already 
been made. 

And secondly, of this appropriation, a large portion, being ap 
plied to pay the interest of the debt, could have no effect to diminish 
the debt itself; since the interest might be paid to the end of time 
without any diminution of the debt. 

If seven millions annually had been appropriated to the diminu 
tion of the public debt, it must of course have followed that in the 



iso 4 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 55 

course of two years since the appropriation was made, fourteen 
millions of dollars would have been paid off. 

But the President of the United States, in his message to Con 
gress at the opening of their last session, states that the amount of 
debt paid in one year preceding was "about three millions one 
hundred thousand dollars," and in two years "more than eight 
millions and a half." A great part of this had been paid before the 
act of 29th April, 1802, and consequently was provided for before 
the pretended annual appropriation of seven millions. 

And by the report of the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund, 
made on the 6th day of February last, it appears that of these 
boasted seven millions, nearly five millions during each of the years 
1802 and 1803 were paid "on account of the reimbursement and 
interest of the domestic funded debt" under provisions enacted long 
before Mr. Jefferson s administration commenced. 

With what face then can it be said that under his administration, 
the general government has appropriated seven millions annually 
to the diminution of the public debt? 

But whatever the amount may be of the national debt discharged 
by the present administration, it has not been effected without the 
aid of direct taxes or excise. 

In proof of this, Mr. Morton, please to look to the official ac 
count of receipts and expenditures of the United States for the 
year 1802, and you will find upwards of six hundred thousand dol 
lars in the course of that year received into the treasury from the 
produce of the internal taxes, the principal part of which was ex 
cises, and upwards of two hundred thousand dollars from the direct 
tax. Here then is nearly a million of dollars, which in the year 
1802 aided toward the payment of the national debt. Will you 
tell us that you only meant to say the present administration had 
renounced the aid of excise and direct taxes for the future? Then 
I reply that you meant one thing and said another. Your asser 
tion was, that the general government had, without the aid of 
direct taxes or excise effected an important diminution of the 
national debt. But they have not even renounced this aid for the 



56 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

future. In the last report of the Secretary of the Treasury to Con 
gress on the finances, made the 24th of October last, he estimates 
the arrears of the direct tax then due at two hundred and fifty 
thousand, and the outstanding internal duties, at near four hun 
dred thousand dollars. Here then is upwards of half a million, 
depended upon as future aid from excise and direct tax to discharge 
the debt. I appeal to official documents, and I defy you, Mr. Mor 
ton, to point out any sense in which this part of your assertion was 
founded in truth. 

But further: It is not true that the present administration has 
effected any diminution of the public debt at all. On the contrary 
they have added largely to it. 

Let us take the President s statement as correct, and set down 
eight millions and an half of the debt existing when he came into 
office as paid. But of new debt contracted we must charge nearly 
three millions payable by a convention with Great Britain, and 
fifteen millions for the Louisiana purchase. So for eight millions 
and an half redeemed, we have nearly eighteen millions of ac 
cumulation, and the whole debt of the United States, which at 
the accession of Mr. Jefferson amounted to about seventy-five, 
now exceeds eighty-five millions of dollars. We shall find Mr. Mor 
ton soon making this very purchase of Louisiana, one of his mo 
tives for applause; his willing admiration flies with equal alacrity 
to greet the aggravation or the alleviation of the public burden. 
The value or the hardness of the bargain has, however, no relation 
whatever to the relative amount of public debt. That subject will 
be separately treated. Mr. Morton very well knew that Louisiana 
had saddled this Union with fifteen millions of additional debt. 
He knew or ought to know, that to pay the interest on a part of it, 
seven hundred thousand dollars a year, raised from the duties on 
imports and tonnage, are appropriated, and vested in these very 
Commissioners of the Sinking Fund, who are the trustees of his 
glorious seven millions; and he is now requested in support of his 
own credit, to show any possible sense in which it can consistently 
with truth be said that the present administration has effected a 
diminution of the public debt. 



i8o 4 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 57 

III 1 

From the peculiar stress with which Mr. Morton dwelt upon the 
first article of his intended panegyric upon the general government, 
it is fair to presume that he considered the others as less important 
in themselves, or less calculated to produce the impression he in 
tended; and I shall therefore bestow less time in commenting upon 
them. The reduction of the army to a peace establishment was, 
indeed, a thing which on the complete restoration of peace, would 
have followed, of course, under any administration. The work 
had been chiefly accomplished before Mr. Jefferson s elevation, 
and in all probability this subject would have slept in peace, but 
for the opportunity it afforded of hoisting in that ingenious ex 
ecration against standing armies in time of peace, a sentiment, the 
justice of which I shall not contest, any more than the propriety 
of its expression in any commendation of Mr. Jefferson. 

But when the disposition of our naval force and the Barbary 
war are held up as objects of glory to our general government, 
whatever our candor or our desire to approve may be, we struggle 
to applaud in vain, and however reluctantly, must say that in the 
sycophant we lose sight, utterly lose sight of the American. What 
can be meant by the assertion that we have dictated terms of peace 
to some of the Barbary powers, and rendered harmless the hostility 
of others ? I say, not to what some, but to what one of the Barbary 
powers have we dictated terms of peace. The treaty between us 
and the Emperor of Morocco was broken by one of his cruisers, 
which captured an American vessel. By a fortunate accident, and 
not by any previous disposition by the government of our naval 
force, one of our frigates met and captured the Moorish cruiser and 
her prize. The Emperor of Morocco disavowed the act of hostility 
committed by his cruiser; we restored to him, without indemnity or 
satisfaction, two of his ships which we had in our possession, and 
are taxed to pay the captors of those same ships their prize money, 
for taking them, amounting to one-half their value. 
1 The Repertory, October 30, 1804. 



58 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

The statement is not made for the purpose of censuring any part 
of the proceedings of the general government in relation to the 
Emperor of Morocco. Our seamen were very justly entitled to the 
prize money for their captures. But the simple fact is that the 
people of the United States have paid many thousand dollars, and 
restored two armed ships; for what? Why, for the Emperor of 
Morocco to disavow the violation of his treaty with us I Is this 
dictating terms of peace? 

But further: the whole of these transactions, excepting the pro 
vision for the payment of the prize money, took place, without a 
single disposition of the general government concerning it. The 
violation of the treaty, the capture of the Moorish ships, the disa 
vowal of the Emperor, and the restoration of his cruisers to him, all 
took place before the government had a suspicion of a rupture with 
Morocco. Undoubtedly the most honorable credit is due to the 
Captains Bainbridge and Rodgers and their gallant companions, 
for the capture of the Moorish ships; and their restoration by the 
consul, Mr. Simpson, to obtain the recognition of the old treaty, 
was, as the President justly styles it, "temperate and correct con 
duct." But it must be a braggart temper, indeed, which can boast 
of such an accommodation, as dictating terms of peace. 

If this idle rodomontade is a reflection upon the modesty of the 
nation, the other part of the assertion, that the general government 
has rendered harmless the hostility of other Barbary powers, is an 
insult upon the calamities of our countrymen. What! when by the 
hostilities of the very meanest of those powers we have lost one of 
the best frigates in the navy. When her brave commander, and 
four hundred of our fellow citizens are languishing in captivity at 
Tripoli, are we to be told that their chains are rivetted by harmless 
hostilities? When nearly a million of dollars a year have just been 
added to the burdens upon our commerce, for a Mediterranean 
fund, to support the dispositions now first made of an efficient 
armament against those paltry pirates, is it a time to talk of having 
rendered their hostilities harmless? We read of the Emperor 
Caligula, that he made a triumphal entry at Rome, because he 



1804] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 59 

had picked up cockle shells on the beach of the German ocean; Mr. 
Morton improves upon the ideas of Caligula, and goes to the dun 
geons of Africa to pluck laurels for the brows of Mr. Jefferson. 

Of the purchase of Louisiana I shall not now undertake to dis 
cuss the policy. That it is a great and important feature of Mr. 
Jefferson s administration is unquestionably true. Whether it 
will prove a blessing or a curse to this Union, it is only future time 
that can determine. This much we know, that the price of the 
purchase will be paid almost entirely by the Eastern and Atlantic 
states. Thus much we know, that when admitted as members of 
the Union, the whole weight and power of the purchased territories 
will be thrown into the scale of southern and western influence. In 
the relative situation of the United States, New England and the 
Maritime States have been constantly declining in power and con 
sequence; they must continue to decline in proportion as the growth 
of the southern and western parts shall be more rapid than theirs. 
This vibration of the centre of power, being founded in nature, 
cannot be resisted, and as good citizens it is our duty to acquiesce 
in the event; but to this increasing ascendancy of the south and 
west, the acquisition of Louisiana adds an immense force, never 
contemplated in the original compact of these states. We are 
still to learn whether this excessive southern preponderance will 
be enjoyed with moderation, or used with generosity. Should it 
prove otherwise, and the present symptoms are by no means favor 
able, the people of America will have no cause to thank Mr. Jeffer 
son for his Louisiana bargain. New England particularly, the dupe 
of her own good nature, will find that she has been made to bear 
the charge of aggrandizing a rival interest, for the degradation of 
her own. We are willing to hope for better things; but while the 
cost of the Louisiana purchase hangs like a mill stone upon the 
neck of our commerce; and while all its advantages are in fallacious 
hope and precarious conjecture, it is not a time for New England 
men especially to celebrate as an achievement deserving their 
gratitude, a measure of so very problematical an issue. 

In arriving at the last specific item of Mr. Morton s eulogium, 



60 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

which speaks of our government s "desire to remain in peace with 
all the belligerent nations of Europe, and their firmness to vindicate 
the rights of our citizens against the aggressions of any," we are 
at a loss to imagine to what solitary fact his words can possibly 
bear an allusion. The desire to remain at peace with all the nations 
of Europe but one has, indeed, been conspicuous enough; but their 
firmness to vindicate our rights! Where has it ever been mani 
fested. There is but one way of accounting for Mr. Morton s in 
ferences from facts, and that may be called, the rule of inverse 
deduction; or the rule of making inferences in direct contradiction 
to their premises. Or to adopt the words of Hudibas, 

As by the way of innuendo 
Lucus is made a non lucendo. 

Thus when Mr. Livingston in a public memorial formally pro 
poses that France and the United States should make a common 
cause against Great Britain, Mr. Morton thinks it an indisputable 
proof of our government s desire to remain at peace with all the 
world. Mr. Monroe, as far as any part of his negotiations is known 
to the public, is constantly giving similar proofs of a pacific disposi 
tion. The treatment of the British minister at Washington has 
been exactly conformable to such indications, and Mr. Livingston, 
to place this desire of peace beyond all question, has recently re 
peated an outrageous insult upon the British government. 

On the other hand what rights of our citizens has the govern 
ment vindicated against any aggressions? Mr. Morton says our 
commerce is less interrupted, and says it at the very moment when 
foreign armed ships, both English and French, have violated our 
own territorial rights, and taken men from our merchant vessels, 
men within our own harbors. Never since the United States have 
been an independent nation, never have they been so grossly in 
sulted; and what satisfaction has our government obtained? What 
satisfaction could they ask? When every article of complaint they 
could advance might be retorted with tenfold recrimination upon 
themselves. 



1804] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 61 

We have waded through the sickening detail of Mr. Morton s 
praises, and shall have but little to remark when he comes to gen 
eralize. It is so easy to say that the objects and pursuits of the 
government have been one continued effort to promote the faith, 
justice and honor of the nation; and the peace, security and hap 
piness of all its citizens. It is sc easy to say all this without convey 
ing or even forming any fixed or determinate idea, that we may con 
sider the object of those words to be rather to round a period, 
than to have any meaning. To all general encomium on this ad 
ministration, the destruction of the judiciary, and the system of 
political removals from office, must forever remain insuperable ob 
jections. The first has overthrown all confidence in the stability 
of justice, and the second has given the pernicious example of set 
ting up the government as the prize and the instrument of faction. 
These two corrupted streams, issuing from the same fountain, will 
spread their pestilence over this Union, beyond the lapse of ages 
to purify. They have entailed a curse upon our posterity, which 
the blessings of a thousand Louisianas will never compensate. 

Such then being the materials of which Mr. Morton s motion 
consisted, it is not at all surprising that when its accuracy was once 
becoming a subject of discussion, he should have shrunk from the 
test and withdrawn it from the scrutiny of his opponents. But it 
still remains for him to account for having produced a rhapsody so 
grossly variant from the truth, and so abhorrent to the sentiments 
of the legislature and people of Massachusetts. It appears that he 
withdrew the motion on consultation with some members of his 
own party. This is thus far honorable to them; since it shows that 
they were not prepared to go with him into the rapturous regions 
of romance, for the purpose of daubing Mr. Jefferson with un 
merited flattery; but why did he produce it? Was it to operate as 
a letter of recommendation for himself; as a passport to office from 
which some honest man must be turned out? Or was it to pro 
pitiate the evil genius of Mr. John Randolph to the Yazoo claim 
ants of Georgia lands? If the former was his motive, he may per 
haps have reason for his hopes. We have seen services of a similar 



62 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

character very lately rewarded by the office of Commissioner of 
Loans; and there are still a few federalists of unimpeachable worth, 
who may be thrown breadless upon the world to accommodate 
candidates of such exemplary fervor. But as to the Yazoo pur 
chasers, they may rest assured that ferocity will give as little, or 
less aid to their cause than its justice. Mr. John Randolph s 
opposition is not thus to be appeased or overpowered, and the next 
winter as the last, their agents will have the most indisputable 
proofs of Mr. Jefferson s favoring their claims; but it will so happen 
that they will again be set aside. Desirous as Mr. Jefferson may 
be to have justice done, severe as his one continued effort may be 
for their relief, it can only be obtained by the vote of both houses 
of Congress, and the world knows how little influence he has over 
them. Mr. John Randolph knows very well when to oppose a mo 
tion "from whatever quarter of the House it may come," and if 
on any improper occasion Mr. Jefferson s influence should be in 
hazard of weighing too much in the House, his own sons-in-law 
will take care to restore the balance. The sins of a first purchaser 
will be visited upon all the subsequent assignees, and the corrup 
tions of a Georgia legislature will be punished by the spoils of New- 
England claimants. Grant, however, that the issue should be 
more favorable to their claim, grant that the services of so zealous 
a partisan should find favor in the sight of the national rulers, it 
is obvious that the motives which led to such flaming panegyrics as 
those of Mr. Morton s motion are partial, are private, are personal, 
that they relate only to particular interests, and are in unequivocal 
hostility to the interests of the people. 



No. IV 1 

The second occasion upon which the Virginian faction in the late 
session of the State legislature displayed their determination to 
sacrifice the interests of the State to the purposes of Mr. Jefferson, 

1 The Repertory, November 2, 1804. 



i8o 4 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 63 

was in their conduct respecting the mode of choosing electors of 
President and Vice President. That the choice should be made by 
the people was agreed on all sides; but whether by a general ticket, 
where the whole people should vote for the whole electoral body 
of the State, or whether by separate districts, conformably to the 
mode of choosing members for the national House of Representa 
tives, was made a question upon which one would have thought the 
faction deemed their whole salvation to depend. 

The difference in point of principle, between the two modes of 
election was not worth a cavil. But the difference in the result was 
obvious. Had the choice by districts prevailed, it was contem 
plated that a proportion of partisans of Mr. Jefferson would be 
chosen among the electors, perhaps nearly equal to that he has in 
the House of Representatives. The body would be divided against 
itself, and the voice of Massachusetts in the choice of President of 
the United States would be annihilated. A general ticket they 
knew would give the clear, full, and unequivocal voice of the State, 
and that voice the faction knew was not in their favor. They 
dreaded to hear it, and they struggled with all their violence and 
all their cunning to evade it. Hence, after attempting in every 
shape and form to defeat the resolution for choosing by a general 
ticket, they concluded their career of opposition by offering in each 
House a protest against it, assigning no less than nine reasons for 
their preference of district elections over a general ticket. That 
this measure was concerted by the leaders of the faction in both 
Houses is apparent from the sameness of their pretended reasons; 
but so extreme was the violence and indecency of the language 
used in the protest offered to the House, that many of the members, 
who by a misplaced confidence had signed the paper without know 
ing its contents, declared their [disapprobation of them when they 
discovered what they were, and although the signatures amounted 
to 101, only 53 voted for inserting the protest on the journals of 
the House. 

As the reasons alleged were not the real operative reasons, their 
weakness makes it almost superfluous to refute them. Let us, 



64 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

however, as briefly as possible notice the arguments which are 
given to the world in justification of those intemperate protests. 

First. It is said that the elector ought to know the character and 
sentiments of the candidate for whom he votes, which is impossi 
ble in so extensive a territory as this State; and then the protest of 
the Senate goes on to define the boundaries of the Commonwealth, 
and tells the good people, how many original colonies, judiciary 
districts, counties, towns, and individual souls it contains. 

But there can be no imaginary difficulty in the selection of nine 
teen persons throughout the Commonwealth, whose character and 
sentiments will be sufficiently known to all the electors for every 
necessary purpose of such an election as this. If the office elected 
to were of a nature to require particular talents, or the exertion of a 
peculiar character, as of a representative, a senator, a county treas 
urer, or a selectman, there would be some color for this objection. 
But in this case the persons chosen have but one act to perform, 
and that is to vote. They are merely the proxies of the people to 
deliver the suffrage which they cannot conveniently give them 
selves, and the only quality which the primary elector is interested 
to know of the candidate is, for whom he will vote. Now I do not 
hesitate to say, that this will in the general course of things, be at 
least as well, and perhaps better ascertained by a general ticket, 
than by a choice in districts. In the first formation of the tickets 
recommended by the parties, each of them will undoubtedly select 
such men as will be known to possess the weight and influence 
proper to promote the success of the ticket in his district, and at 
the same time men whose opinions have been so clearly pronounced 
as to leave no doubt of the complexion of their votes. The unity of 
object and of exertion throughout the State will give a more pointed 
energy to the support of every individual candidate. The pro 
testers themselves will find none of the difficulty which they al 
lege, nor will their adherents have any of that ignorance of the 
character and sentiments of those candidates for whom they 
will vote, which they so pathetically deplore. If their ticket 
should fail of success, it will not be for want of certain knowl- 



1804] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 65 

edge how their candidates would discharge the duties assigned 
them. 

Second. Election by a general ticket is said to be repugnant to 
the habits and usages of the people. But the national convention 
itself, under which this election first originated, is so recent in date, 
that no usage can be predicated upon it. The election has hitherto 
occurred but four times, and has not been uniform in mode. The 
whole people have always voted in this manner for the two highest 
executive officers of the State, and in one instance for a member of 
Congress. Every county annually chooses its senators by a gen 
eral ticket. So that this mode of election is perfectly familiar to 
the people throughout the Commonwealth, and there can be no 
more difficulty in forming or delivering a ticket of nineteen names 
selected from the whole State, than a ticket of five or six names 
selected from a whole county. 

Third. "Because this mode is calculated to open the door to 
intrigue and imposition on the people." 

The protesters have not explained their grounds for this asser 
tion, which is merely matter of opinion. Without contesting their 
skill and experience on this head, it may be observed that this mode 
of election has been sanctioned by all the principal States, in which 
their party predominates. The doors of intrigue and imposition 
will be open in every mode of election to a people that will tolerate 
them; but on general principles it is more natural to infer, that 
these corrupt engines lose their efficacy in proportion as the num 
ber of voters is increased. 

Fourth. This mode of election is fallacious, because the candi 
date selected from any given district may vote contrary to the 
wishes of a majority in that district. 

The selection of a candidate from each of the seventeen districts 
which elect a member to Congress must have been for the purpose 
of distributing equally throughout the Commonwealth the honors 
of an important appointment; an example which the general gov 
ernment, in their one continued effort for the happiness of all, have 
yet to learn. As each elector will be an elector for the whole Com- 



66 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

monwealth, undoubtedly the partial majorities of single districts 
will merge in the general majority of the whole State. It will not 
array the vote of one county against the vote of another, and thus 
reduce the influence of the Commonwealth to a level with that of 
the smallest State in the Union; but will give to Massachusetts her 
full constitutional weight. This is no fallacy. The fallacy would 
be in such a difference of the modes of election, that while all the 
southern States take care to give unanimous votes, the people of 
Massachusetts should be amused with a mere show of voting, and 
in fact have no voice at all. 

Fifth. This objection included so gross and pointed an insult 
upon the majority of the legislature, that it was finally disavowed 
by many of the signers themselves; nor have they chosen to publish 
it with the rest. 

Sixth. This is a repetition in other words of the fourth objection. 
A complaint that one party, meaning their own party, will be de 
prived of their due weight in the election. But that party will have 
much more than its due weight, by securing to themselves the whole 
weight of such States as Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York. 
The language of those gentlemen is, where we are the minority we 
must have our full proportion, and where we are the majority we 
will have all. 

Seventh. This mode of election, it is supposed, will have a 
tendency to excite heats and animosities; and to disturb the har 
mony and tranquillity of the State. 

This is another conjectural objection. It is just as easy and much 
more agreeable to anticipate that it will be productive of more 
harmony and lead to unanimity. It seems much more probable 
that an obstinate and persevering attempt to degrade the State, to 
destroy its influence in the Union, and to reduce its condition in 
the political orb, from that of a primary planet, to that of the 
meanest of satellites, should produce discord and irritation. 

Then come the two reasons why the protesters prefer the elec 
tion by districts. These are only repetitions of some of those 
before adduced as objections against the mode which prevailed. 



i8o 4 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 67 

Such are the arguments, if arguments they can be called, by 
which a large minority in ,both branches of your legislature, fellow 
citizens of Massachusetts, varnished the attempt to deprive you 
of your constitutional suffrage, at the approaching election of 
President and Vice President. For this was the undoubted real 
motive and design in this attempt. They know that if your opinion 
should be fully and fairly taken, it would be against their party 
measures, party projects, and party candidates. They wished 
therefore to drown your voice altogether. It was impossible for 
them to give a more convincing proof that their attachment to their 
faction overpowers their attachment to the Commonwealth. 

In order to set this observation in its true light and to show its 
full importance, we must again remark, that if the mode of choos 
ing electors by single districts were established throughout the 
Union, Mr. Jefferson and his administration would lose so many 
electors, that his re-election would be doubtful in the highest de 
gree. It is at least certain that they dared not make the experi 
ment. For when the amendment to the Constitution which was 
carried through Congress last winter to secure the re-election, 
Mr. Huger, a warm federalist moved, on the 2Oth of October, at 
the very commencement of the session, as a further amendment 
to be sent out to the State legislatures with the other: 

"That the State legislatures shall from time to time, divide each 
State into districts, equal to the whole number of senators and 
representatives from each State in the Congress of the United 
States; and shall direct the mode of choosing an elector of President 
and Vice President in each of the said districts, who shall be chosen 
by citizens having the qualifications requisite for electors of the 
most numerous branch of the State legislature; and that the dis 
tricts so to be constituted shall consist, as nearly as may be, of 
contiguous territory, and of equal proportion of population, except 
where there may be any detached portion of territory, not of it 
self sufficient to form a district, which then shall be annexed to 
some other portion nearest thereto; which districts, when so 
divided, shall remain unalterable until a new census of the United 
States shall be taken." 

Here we see this very measure of voting for electors by single 



68 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

districts, proposed as a general measure to operate throughout the 
United States. But observe, it was brought forward by a federalist; 
for although the legislature of New York had expressly instructed 
their senators to propose this very amendment with the other, 
those senators had obeyed only one-half their instructions. They 
brought forward the discriminating amendment, and passed over 
the other in total silence. 

Mr. Huger s motion was committed to the same committee who 
had the other under consideration, but they did not act upon it at 
all; and although Mr. Huger pressed the subject as often as .he 
could during the session, he never could prevail upon the majority 
in the House of Representatives, so much as to discuss his motion; 
and on the 2d of March, when he moved that it might be referred 
to a committee of the whole, his request, though supported by all 
the federal members, was negatived. 

I intreat you, fellow citizens, to compare this conduct of the 
same faction so nearly at the same time, in the national House of 
Representatives, and in your State legislature. The only manner 
possible whereby a choice of electors by single districts can be made 
to operate fairly and equally throughout the Union, is that it 
should be uniformly established. Yet when this is proposed in an 
assembly, where Mr. Jefferson s majority is all powerful, a member 
of the most respectable character, backed by the instructions of 
one of the first legislatures in the Union, is refused even .the dis 
cussion of the proposal; and at the same time your own legislature 
cannot secure to you the very same advantage, to which Mr. 
Jefferson s partisans so tenaciously adhere. Where they hold it, 
they cannot place you on the same footing with your Virginian 
fellow citizens, without being grossly insulted, and without pro 
tests of your own servants against this your enjoyment of equal 
rights. 



i8o 4 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 69 



To an impartial spectator of passing events, the movements of 
political factions in a free government are always objects of curious 
and interesting speculation. In countries approaching so near a 
democracy as these United States, it must ever be the primary ob 
ject for the leaders of party to court the favor of the people. There 
are two modes of accomplishing this with success; one of which 
consists in rendering real service to the public, and the other by 
professing extraordinary solicitude for the people, by flattering 
their prejudices, by ministering to their passions, and by humoring 
their transient and changeable opinions. These two processes for 
the attainment of the same object, are scarcely ever combined to 
gether, and as the ambitious and aspiring must universally be 
impelled to aim at the end, so the choice of the means takes its 
complexion from the individual character of every candidate for 
power through popularity. In times of national difficulty and 
distress, when the service of the public is a service of danger and of 
toil, when deeds are the only test of attachment to the country, 
and mere words are estimated at their proper worth, the patriot by 
action generally obtains the ascendancy; but in days of peace and 
tranquillity, when the duties of public life are little more than a 
routine, when honor without peril, and profit without sacrifice is 
the result of public employment, then the patriot by profession 
takes his turn, and often bears away the palm from his more re 
served and unassuming competitor. 

This distinction between the patriot by profession and the patriot 
by action could not be better illustrated than in the contrast be 
tween the struggle for a general ticket, upon which in my late 
numbers I have animadverted, and the effort of the same party in 
opposition to Mr. Ely s motion. We have seen on the former occa 
sion great professions of regard for the people. We have seen a

yo THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

minority in the legislature undertaking to say that the people pre 
ferred election by districts, because they preferred it themselves, 
and formally assigning this preference of the people, as one of the 
conclusive reasons for their s, when the people had never mani 
fested, and probably never entertained such a sentiment. This 
was patriotism by profession. The protesters take for granted 
that the people like their project best, and then make a merit of 
advocating it for that reason. When Mr. Ely brought forward his 
motion, the object of which was to render the people a real service, 
a great and important service, then these flaming wordy patriots 
lost all their zeal, and instead of supporting it with that genuine 
devotion to the interests of the people, which they had so recently 
trumpeted abroad, either slunk from the discharge of their duty, 
and their vote as legislators, or attempted to check by insidious 
amendment, or by open opposition, a measure of the deepest 
moment to the welfare of the people. The reasons upon which are 
grounded the instruction for which Mr. Ely moved are so clear, so 
strong, and so indisputable, that no direct answer to them has 
been attempted either in the legislature, or in the newspaper specu 
lations which have appeared on the subject. The rule of represen 
tation prescribed by the Constitution of the United States is 
universally admitted to be unequal, and when combined with the 
practice under the Constitution is oppressive on all the States 
holding few or no slaves. At present the people of the United 
States consist of two classes. A privileged order of slave-holding 
Lords, and a race of men degraded to a lower station, merely be 
cause they are not slave-holders. Every planter south of the 
Potomac has one vote for himself, and three votes in effect for 
every five slaves he keeps in bondage; while a New England farmer, 
who contributes tenfold as much to the support of the government, 
has only a single vote. Our share of representation is only pro 
portionate to numbers; their share is in the same proportion of 
numbers, and their property is represented besides. At the time 
when the Constitution was formed, this provision was submitted 
to on the ground that the burden of taxation should be apportioned 



i8o 4 ] JOHN QUINCE ADAMS 7 i 

to the benefit of representation. The experience of fifteen years, 
however, has proved the error of these calculations. The expe 
rience of fifteen years has proved that four-fifths of the burdens of 
this government must be supported by the States which have no 
representation for slaves. The benefit pledged to us as compensa 
tion for inadequate taxation is not secured to us. We are doubly 
taxed, and they are doubly represented. 

The necessary consequence of this has been the loss of all our 
weight and influence in the Councils of the Union. It is a fact well 
ascertained that this excess of southern representation decided the 
fate of the last election for President and Vice President of the 
United States; the same event must inevitably follow every contest 
in which the interests of the North and those of the South shall be 
at variance. While the present system of representation continues, 
an even balance in the national councils must not be expected. 
The slave representation, like the sword of Brennus, will forever 
be thrown into the Southern scale, and must forever make our s 
kick the beam. 

In a moral and political view, this representation of slaves is 
alike objectionable. The number of those miserable beings al 
ready existing in some States is such as to occasion the most serious 
alarm in all humane and thinking minds. Mr. Jefferson has said 
that the populace of large cities no more add strength to the body 
politic, than sores to the body natural. If this comparison be just 
the slaves of our southern neighbors are abscesses of the deepest 
and most dangerous matter to our national body. Instead of 
strength they are distemper, deadly distemper, which if it cannot 
be eradicated, ought at least not to be fostered and stimulated. 
By allowing representation for slaves, we encourage and reward 
the infamous traffic of human flesh; and accordingly we find that 
although at one period this traffic was prohibited in all our States, 
yet the temptation to allow it has already overpowered every other 
consideration in South Carolina, and she has opened all her ports 
to that disgraceful trade. 

It will not be necessary at this day to prove that in the eye of 



72 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

morality this purchase and sale of man is criminal. The laws of 
the United States have long since declared it so, and as such it is 
prohibited to every citizen of the United States on the severest 
penalties. Thus the Constitution instigates and urges the South 
ern States to that which the laws punish as a crime. It makes the 
highest privilege of freemen the purchase of accumulated slavery. 
It says to the Northern and navigating States, you shall not trade 
in slaves. If you do, your ships and their cargoes shall be confis 
cated, your estates shall be ruined by fines, and your persons shall 
be buried in dungeons; and at the same breath it says to the 
Southern States, deal in slaves, multiply the fetters of your bond 
age, and for every five victims of avarice and cruelty, you import 
within your territories, you shall have an increase of three votes 
towards composing the legislative and executive authorities of the 
nation. For in the very same act it offers a bounty to one citizen, 
while it brandishes the scourge over another. Can anything be 
more inhuman? Can anything be more absurd? 

Thus in whatever point of view we contemplate this provision 
in the Constitution, whether as moralists, as politicians, or as citi 
zens, it calls aloud for amendment. Yet in the legislature of 
Massachusetts itself were found men who made the most formal 
and pointed opposition against a fair and constitutional attempt 
to obtain this amendment. And what were the arguments they 
alleged? They were worthy of the cause in which they were ad 
vanced. 

They said, that it might perhaps give offense to Virginia and the 
slave-holding States, and thus endanger the existence of the 
Union. 

But surely propositions of amendment to the Constitution can 
give no offense to those States whose most influential characters 
have been and still are clamorous for amendments much more 
calculated to strike at the existence of the Union; who are con 
tinually telling us that the Constitution not only permits, but in 
vites proposals of amendment; who have just accomplished one 
which they deemed essential to the increase of their own power; 



i8o4] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 73 

and who have announced their determination tc accomplish others, 
still more contrariant to the principles upon which that compact 
was originally settled. 

This fear of giving offense by the exercise of an indisputable right, 
under the sanction of every inducement which justice, humanity, 
and liberty can inspire, is a motive which ought not to be urged 
upon freemen. It is an appeal to weakness, a plea to cowardice, 
an argument fit only for slaves to utter and to hear. It discovers a 
mind prepared for every degree of submission. It is language of 
a negro driver on a plantation, to the wretches who tremble under 
his lash; but it can find no accessible corner in the heart of a New 
England farmer. 

The pretense of danger to the Union cannot be credited by those 
who raise it. The amendment, when proposed in Congress, will 
be adopted or rejected. If adopted, it will have a greater tendency 
to cement and perpetuate the Union than anything that has 
occurred since the adoption of the Constitution itself. If rejected, 
its friends will undoubtedly submit to the constitutional decision, 
and wait until the progress of reason shall produce a state of things 
more favorable to the purposes of justice. Of the seventeen States 
there are only five whose representation is increased by the slaves 
they hold. Twelve States, therefore, have a permanent and de 
cisive interest, which must unite them eventually in wiping away 
this national scandal. 1 Of the five whose number of members 
would be reduced by the amendment, Georgia would lose but one 
member, and North Carolina only two. The relative weight of 
these two States would, therefore, rather be raised than depressed 
by the exchange, and their interest will concur with that of the 
twelve. Even in Virginia, the inhabitants beyond the mountains, 
who constitute a majority of the freemen in that Commonwealth, 
would gain rather than lose in their proportion of the representa 
tion; so that when once the voice of solid and undeniable interest, 
concurring with those of honor and Republican principle, shall 

1 In his remarks in the Senate he altered the numbers to seven slave and ten 
non-slave-holding States. 



74 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

cease to be stifled by the deafening din of party spirit, there can be 
no doubt but that the amendment will prevail. This consideration 
will naturally lead the friends of the measure to pursue it at once 
with temper and perseverance. Persuaded that the Union is the 
first of political blessings to every part of these States, they will 
never be inclined to hazard it for any subordinate consideration; 
at the same time, assured that the more firmly its foundations are 
fixed on the foundations of freedom and equal rights, the more solid 
and durable will be the fabric, they will not relax their mild but 
determined exertions until the honorable object for which they 
contend shall be attained. 

But it was asserted that when the Constitution was debated in 
the State convention this very article was warmly advocated by 
the most distinguished characters in that body, who advocated its 
adoption. 

It must be remembered that the Constitution was then an un 
tried experiment; every one of the important States in the Union 
was divided almost equally on the propriety of adopting it at all. 
In the Massachusetts convention the vote of adoption was carried 
only by a majority of eighteen in three hundred and seventy mem 
bers. Those who on the main question were for the rejection of the 
instrument, of course, raised every possible objection of detail 
which their ingenuity could devise; and they who conceived it of 
the utmost importance upon the whole that it should be adopted 
were often called upon to justify or palliate sections which sepa 
rately considered might have been highly objectionable to them 
selves. How the government would operate in practice was neces 
sarily conjectural; and they whose hopes were chiefly founded upon 
the result of the whole system, naturally became sanguine in their 
expectation of advantages from particular parts. 

The ground upon which this paragraph was supported by the 
federalists in the Massachusetts convention was that it sanctioned 
the principle of making representation and taxation go hand in 
hand. The objections against it were that the negroes would not 
be taxed enough for this proportion, and it was compared with the 



i8o 4 J JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 75 

mode established in the old confederation of raising quotas in pro 
portion to the lands surveyed and improvements. The inequality 
of representation resulting from this article was not foreseen; no 
objection of that nature was raised. It has risen from the non- 
execution of that part of it which favors us the taxation, while 
the part which favors our Southern States, the representation, is 
carried into full effect. Both parties took it for granted that as we 
should be represented, so should we be taxed. The practice of the 
Constitution has proved otherwise. In the course of fifteen years 
the direct tax has been resorted to only once, and then was paid 
ineffectually, or not at all, by the slave-holding States. The 
treasury has not received a dollar of this tax from South Carolina 
or Georgia, and several others of those States are great defaulters 
in that payment. 

This amendment then, thus reasonable in itself, thus urged by 
every moral and political consideration, and thus required by the 
unequivocal interest of a proportion of those States abundantly 
sufficient to carry it through, can be resisted effectually only by 
the operation of a single cause; the undue influence of the national 
executive. The President of the United States belongs to that part 
of the State of Virginia which, by the effect of the iniquitous mode 
of representation now established, sends at least two representa 
tives to Congress, where upon principles of equal rights, they ought 
to send but one. His personal and local interests are, of course, in 
opposition to the proposed amendment, and there is no doubt but 
all his influence will be exerted against it. If we judge of the party 
which now governs this Union by their acts, it will appear that their 
whole political system centres in personal attachment to him and 
his views, while on the other part his system consists in substituting 
them instead of the nation. The destruction of the judiciary in 
dependence; the persevering system of turning out honest men 
from office to introduce partisans in their place; and the amend 
ment to the Constitution, carried through with such extreme 
precipitation, and at such heavy expense to the people of this 
country, for the sole purpose of securing his re-election, are all 



76 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

explained by this solution, and can be explained by no other. It is 
this consideration which makes it of the utmost importance to the 
people of Massachusetts to mark the conduct of that faction here. 
Let us not deceive ourselves with fallacious hopes. So long as a 
formidable party among ourselves shall oppose our restoration to 
equal rights, we shall certainly never obtain it. They who derive 
the benefit from exclusive privileges will not readily relinquish 
them; and while the cause of freedom is paralyzed by defection in 
its own ranks, it can meet with nothing but defeat. 

An anxious concern for the liberties and interests of my fellow 
citizens has been the sole inducement to these remarks, which I 
shall now bring to a conclusion. On three important occasions in 
the legislature of the State, we have seen the leaders of a party 
running counter to the manifest and momentous interest of the 
State. It was conceived an injunction of public duty to show: 
First, that the arguments and pretended facts alleged for this 
strange dereliction of principle were not founded in truth; and 
secondly, that those party leaders were under the influence of 
certain partial and personal inducements, different from, and in 
opposition to, the interests of their constituents. The singularity 
of their conduct necessarily led to an investigation of its motives, 
and the discovery of the motives furnishes a clear elucidation of 
the conduct. It is with the most cordial satisfaction I have ob 
served, that on every one of those occasions, many individuals of 
the party in the House of Representatives refused to go the lengths 
to which the leaders would have impelled them. The motion of a 
panegyric on Mr. Jefferson was hence withdrawn. The insult 
upon the majority of the legislature was disavowed by many of 
those who in an unguarded hour had signed it; and on the final 
question upon Mr. Ely s motion, the small number of those who 
dared to vote against it was a proof that all were not equally pre 
pared to abandon their country, to please their patron. I am sorry 
to have seen no such signs of compunction in the minority of the 
Senate. To those who thus staggered at the sacrifice of duty re 
quired of them, and started back from the threshold of guilt to 



i8o 4 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 77 

which they had been drawn, the present recess of the legislature 
gives a favorable opportunity for the reflection. Let us fervently 
hope that they will see the precipice into which interested and art 
ful men have been struggling to push them, and by their future 
conduct will prove that they are determined to pursue the path 
of their duty, and cling to the true interest of their country. 



TO JOHN ADAMS 

WASHINGTON, 3 November, 1804. 



DEAR SIR: 



Since my arrival here I have called upon the President, 
who had some conversation with me respecting the conduct 
of the British frigates on our coast during the course of the 
last summer, and respecting the trade of arms and ammuni 
tion principally carried on from New York to St. Domingo. 
He said nothing relative to the controversies with Spain as 
to the murmurs of Louisiana. 1 

As to the British frigates there is no official information 
of that disapprobation by the British government upon the 
conduct of their officers, which has been announced in the 
newspapers. Nor does it appear that the captains of the 
Cambrian and Leander, or either of them, have been re 
called. 2 But they have not given any recent cause of com 
plaint, and by the letters from Mr. Monroe the ministry give 
him perfect satisfaction upon every representation made by 
him on the subject. The conduct of their ships and officers 
in the European seas is also generally such as is satisfactory

to him. The disposition of the present Ministry is also very 
amicable. 

The trade from New York to St. Domingo is a subject of 
grievous complaint to the French Minister, 1 who perempto 
rily demands that our government should interfere to sup 
press it. The blacks give such excessive prices for arms and 
ammunition, that general merchants in New York have 
fitted out, and are still fitting out, vessels to send them these 
articles; in some instances they have armed the ships in force 
sufficient to force their way through in case of attack by the 
French privateers. Mr. Jefferson thinks that on the return 
of any of these armed vessels, if they should have fought 
with a French privateer and killed one of her men, our 
judges ought to hang every man on board the American ves 
sel for murder. He draws his inference from the common 
law principle, that homicide committed in support of an un 
lawful act is murder. But common law rules should not 
be applied to the objects which essentially belong to the 
laws of nations. I questioned the accuracy of his argument, 
but asked him why the government had not interposed to 
prevent the arming of these vessels at New York. He said 
the law would not bear them out in such interference, though 
he admitted it had been done at an early period of the late 
war. This he first said was by virtue of a temporary law; but 
afterwards recollecting himself said it had been done with 
out a law, and submitted to. But that had it been contested, 
the authority of the government would not have been sup 
ported for the measure. Hence I conclude we shall have a 
law for such an authority at the approaching session. 

I have seen General Wilkinson, who has taken a house here 
to reside during the session. I imagine he waits for an an

heads to his officers is denied at the War office, and, therefore,

TO JOHN ADAMS 

[November, 1804.] 
MY DEAR SIR: 

I have been happy to receive your obliging favor of the 
I4th instant, and much obliged to you for your opinions 
respecting the points of maritime law, which require our 
attention at this time. A coincidence of your opinion with 
that of the President of the United States would be more 
than enough to stagger me in any point upon which I should 
have formed a different one. It makes me, therefore, pecu 
liarly mistrust that which I entertain on this subject. The 
President s position was that our judges ought to hang Amer 
ican citizens who should have committed homicide in re 
sisting the execution of French revenue laws in the West 
Indies. And he gave to support his reasoning the common 
law principle, that homicide committed in support of an 
unlawful act is murder. In this opinion you say he was 
right. I can only reply what I replied to him: That I had al 
ways considered it as a settled maxim that no nation takes 
notice of the revenue or colonial laws of another nation; and 
therefore that our judges could not hang Americans in the 
case he put, for homicide in support of acts which to our 
judges were not unlawful. I have, however, even believed 
that in these cases of contraband, unless the French judges 
should violate the universal usage of nations, they themselves 
could not hang our people for homicide in such a case 
either as murder or as piracy. It is an act sui generis 



8o THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

forcing a contraband trade by foreign subjects. And persons 
taken even after fighting and killing to force their way in 
such cases are punishable neither for murder nor piracy, but 
for supporting contraband by violence. I know very well 
that such transactions have sometimes produced wars be 
tween nations; but I never yet heard of an instance in which 
the common law maxim, that homicide in support of tres 
pass was murder, has ever been adopted into the laws of na 
tions as relating to forcible contraband trade by foreign sub 
jects. There appears to me to be very cogent reasons why 
the principle ought not to apply; and as far as my recollec 
tion serves it is in practice never made to apply. It may 
perhaps resemble that stipulation in almost all the commer 
cial treaties, that if a subject of either party shall take a 
commission against the other from a third power, and be 
taken, he shall be punished as a pirate. Now pirates, as you 
justly observe, are punished with death; and yet I have al 
ways understood that by the universal usage of nations, 
that offence by positive stipulation made punishable like 
piracy, is not punishable with death. I have consulted the 
British statutes which you mention respecting the trial and 
punishment of piracy, but they do not seem to me at all to 
settle the question. For in all instances where they speak 
specifically, they mention hostilities by British subjects 
against other British subjects; seeming in some sort thereby 
to make the distinction between them and foreigners for 
which I contend. Besides none of these statutes seem to 
contemplate cases of forcible contraband; nor do I find any 
thing in the books holding this up as piracy. I shall be very 
glad to read over again Judge Marshall s speech in the 
House of Representatives on the case of the pirate and 
murderer Nash. 1 I recollect it perfectly well, having read it 

* Annals of Congress, 6th Cong., 596.

with much pleasure as published at the time when it was 
delivered. But this case stands again on different grounds. 
I have no doubt as to the nature of Hash s offence. 

It is indeed very apparent that popularity bears a strong 
resemblance to the itch by its contagion, and the President, 
who has himself enough of the itch of popularity, may con 
gratulate himself upon its wide spread in Massachusetts. I 
consider the revolution there as completed, and that in the 
spring both our executive and legislature will pass into other 
hands and other principles. What the new principles will 
be, may be inferred from the character of the future chief 
magistrate, and the experience we have had of the conse 
quences attending similar changes in the other states. Their 
tendency will be to corrupt public opinions and to introduce 
much injustice and oppression. But the national prosperity 
appears to be very little affected by all these party over 
throws. It is in the season of the harvest that the pernicious 
effects of the weeds sowed in spring are felt. 

We have hitherto done here nothing or next to nothing. 
But such idleness is better than the activity which will prob 
ably succeed. There are three deputies from New Orleans 
arrived, 1 but they have not yet presented their remonstrance. 
I have read a French pamphlet published in that country, 
containing a detail of their grievances, and our sovereigns 
here begin to think that forcing laws upon a people, in a 
language of which they are ignorant, and sending them 
officers who can neither understand them nor be understood 
by them, is a little incongruous for the most enlightened 
people upon earth. My expectation is that the system to be 
adopted will pass from one extreme to the other, and that 
the next step will be to admit them by act of Congress into 
the Union as a State, and empower them to make their own

TO JOHN ADAMS 

WASHINGTON, n December, 1804. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

I received together last evening your two favors of 3Oth 
ultimo and 2nd instant, for which I most sincerely return 
you my thanks. In the dreary path which I am now com 
pelled to tread, it is cheering to the spirits and gives the most 
pleasing consolation to have occasionally the benefit of your 
correspondence. What the issue of the election in Massa 
chusetts will be on the harmony of the ruling party, I do not 
venture to conjecture; but that it has already sunk the in 
fluence of New England, low as it was before, I have suffi 
cient evidence to be satisfactory to my own mind. The 
choice of Parson Bentley l as chaplain to the House of Repre 
sentatives at the commencement of this session will show 
you what is held out to the New England members as proofs 
of their weight in the councils of the Union, and what they 
are willing to accept as such. I think this favor must content 
them for the present session. The claimants of the Georgia 
lands must go home again reinjecta, for there appears to me 
from all the symptoms yet discovered much less chance for 
them this session, than there was last winter. But I presume 
Mr. Morton 2 gets well compensated by his fellow-claimants 
for his yearly visits to the seat of government, and if he is 
not successful in the pursuit of their interests, he may perhaps

eventually obtain some consolation and indemnity for the 
injury to his own. He has not yet been appointed to the 
office that I have heard of, but this morning the Senate 
have consented to and advised the appointment of Benjamin 
Austin, junior, to the office of Commissioner of Loans for 
the State of Massachusetts. This subject of appointments 
in Senate has undergone a great revolution since you pre 
sided here. In all possible cases provisional appointments 
are made during the recess, so that when the Senate meet, the 
candidates proposed to their consideration are already in 
possession of the offices to which they are to be appointed. 
The forms of deliberation are however tenaciously adhered 
to, and with some degree of affectation. Nomination lists 
are postponed from time to time, without any other reason 
for postponement, and when acted upon the candidates reg 
ularly receive from the Senators of their state a panegyric 
usually very highly charged. To this course of proceeding 
I have never known any exception, but in two or three in 
stances from federal members, on the ground of objections 
against the moral characters of the candidates. And the 
only effect of such objections has been to take the vote by 
yeas and nays, when in every such instance all the members 
excepting the federalists have voted for the persons excepted , 
against. I have uniformly borne testimony in favor of the 
candidates of Massachusetts, when I knew them, and could 
honestly do it independent of all considerations of politics. 
And especially in the instances of Henry Warren and of 
Mr. Bowdoin. 1 In all other cases I have been silent when 
I could; for experience had shown me that to object infamy 
of character against a man would be a sure means of securing 
about three votes in four upon record in his favor. This 
silence has been from the same motive become so habitual 

1 James Bowdoin (1752-1811), minister to Spain.

with all the minority, that the ruling party seem to be a 
little uneasy under it. This morning on going into the 
nomination list, the first appearance was that it would go 
through without any comment, excepting the little prettiness 
of postponing some half dozen names for further informa 
tion to be eulogized the next time they are taken up. But 
after getting on some way Mr. Franklin, 1 a very scrupulous 
gentleman, rose and said these were very important appoint 
ments, and he did not like to act upon them without some 
testimony from members who could bear it, and particularly 
from the members of the states to which the candidates be 
longed. Bye and bye came the name of Benjamin Austin, 
junior. Profound silence for some minutes. At last I rose 
and said that "I knew Mr. Austin, but could say nothing 
of him." Upon which Mr. Ellery, 2 of Rhode Island, rose 
and said, Mr. Austin was a man of very great abilities and a 
most respectable character. He sat down and Benjamin 
Austin, junior, was appointed nemine contradicente, just as 
he would have [been], if Mr. Franklin had been less anxious 
for testimony from the Senators of the states where the 
candidates belonged. 

In making and reiterating the request that you would 
commit to writing memoirs of your own life, I did not ex 
pect that it would consist of recollections altogether pleasing. 
I am well aware that the pictures both of men and events, 
which your unalterable regard to truth would often render 
necessary, must be marked with very dark shades. But such 
must be the fate of every man who distinguishes himself in 
any eminent manner among his fellow men; and I was and 
remain decided in the opinion, that a work of this kind from 
you would be extremely useful both to your family and your

country. I am persuaded from the vigor and accuracy of 
your judgment, neither vanity nor disappointment would 
suffer you to misrepresent or mistake any material part of 
the narrative, and that you would always have a due control 
over all the natural instigations of self-complacency and im 
portance, which must continually occur to a man writing of 
himself. As to the exhibition in their nakedness of other 
eminent men, it is one of the principal reasons for which I 
wished you to write; I am sure you will treat them all with 
perfect candor; that you will do them honorable and impar 
tial justice. But I am also sure that you will make them 
known to us in their real colors, stripped of all their disguises 
in which their own arts or the hopes or fears of others have 
arrayed them. I intreat you to reconsider this subject, and 
hope you will comply with my request. The plan of the 
work may be suited to your own convenience, and com 
pressed into a small or dilated to a voluminous extent as you 
please. 

The bill for the preservation of peace in the ports and 
harbors has met with much investigation in the House of 
Representatives, and has not yet come to us twice re 
committed to the reporting committee, and yet laboring. 
There is also another bill for establishing an Admiralty 
Court in the Mediterranean which it appears to me calls 
for much consideration. This, and the other bills in embryo, 
which I have regularly forwarded for my brother, will show 
that the other House have got seriously engaged in business, 
which is yet very languishing with us. 

Another appointment this morning William Lyman of 
Massachusetts, Consul at LONDON. He was appointed about 
a fortnight ago Surveyor and Inspector at New Orleans; but 
it seems the climate of England suits him better than that 
of Louisiana. General Smith this morning declared that

unless some member of the Senate would testify to Mr. 
Lyman s competency for this office, he should vote against 
him, for it was an important office and ought to be well 
filled. Upon which Mr. Lyman s panegyric was pronounced 
by Messrs. Giles, Mitchill and Bradley, perfectly to General 
Smith s satisfaction. Smith had served several years in the 
House with Lyman, and it seems in all that time did not dis 
cover his merits. Mr. Giles had been more penetrating; for 
he alleged that very circumstance as the only basis of his 
knowledge; and now though Smith was so far from being 
satisfied with his own observations at that time, that he was 
determined to vote against this able man, unless somebody 
would give him a certificate of character, he readily takes 
upon trust Mr. Giles certificate founded on the same prin 
ciples from which Smith himself had drawn so different a 
conclusion. So you see nobody can be appointed without a 
puff, just fit for a newspaper obituary. 

The French Minister, General Turreau, has called upon 
me. His family has not yet arrived. The President com 
plains that he glitters too much with gold lace, and hopes in 
time to get him down to a plain frock coat. The Legion of 
Honor has a bauble at the buttonhole so closely resembling 
the old Croix de St. Louis, that it requires an opera glass to 
discover the difference between them. The President told 
me that the best thing which could now happen to the 
French nation would be to recall the old family III and take 
up the Constitution of 1791. For that although that con 
stitution made the government too weak I! and was defective 
in having a legislature in one branch! yet even that would 
be better than the present unlimited domination. I hope 
he does not talk so to any body who will carry his words to 
the Emperor Napoleon. 

Ever affectionately yours.

PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION ON 
REPRESENTATION 1 

[December, 1804.] 

The proposition submitted by my colleague to the consideration 
of the Senate, conformably to the instructions of our immediate 
constituents, the Legislature of Massachusetts, is, I am sensible, 
of such a nature that it cannot be expected to be received by this 
body with unanimous approbation. It would doubtless be a more 
agreeable task, both to him and to me, were it in the compass of our 
power to introduce and advocate any measure of important benefit 
to all the people of the United States, and in support of which we 
might reasonably calculate upon every vote in this and the other 
House of Congress. But if this unanimity would be an idle ex 
pectation upon almost any question which can be brought before 
us; if it were a more than idle expectation upon almost any question 
of the magnitude and importance of this; preeminently vain and 
absurd would be the hope of such unanimity, on a question against 
which we have to contend with the local interests, and exclusive 
privileges of a powerful and respectable portion of the Union. 

But it is in the unalterable nature of things that every public 
measure of great importance should, in some degree, differently 
affect the partial interests and feelings of the different parts of the 
nation. Our association consists of constituent parts, whose super 
ficial interests are not only variant but often opposite to each 
other. The seamen of your seaports would naturally say the monies 
raised upon the hard earnings of our industry ought to be exclu 
sively appropriated to our benefit. But perhaps in another quarter 
might be found very respectable citizens who would think a sea 
man s fund collected at Baltimore or Philadelphia a very proper

motion in the newspaper article, page 69, supra. These remarks were to be de 
livered in the Senate, but it is doubtful if an opportunity offered, as they are not 
mentioned in the Annals of Congress for this session. See Adams, Memoirs,

88 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

object of application for the support of the common town paupers 
elsewhere. Is the revenue from the post office to be appropriated 
to the improvement of the roads? The merchant who pays the 
postage would deem it reasonable that it should go to ameliorate 
the roads and accelerate the communication of that correspondence 
which furnishes the money. But a holder of wild-lands, wishing 
a road through the desert made at any cost but his own, will come 
and with the acuteness of a metaphysician will show, that postage 
is not a tax but a compensation for a service rendered; that gov 
ernment has a right to insist upon rendering this service and upon 
being paid its own price for it; and if it can thus raise money from 
one citizen, it has a right equally clear and indisputable to bestow 
it upon another. The merchant perhaps may not feel the force 
of this reasoning, but what can he do? What can he do? What he 
does. Pay his postage, and hear of roads opened through the 
wilderness. 

But we have all a deep a permanent and a paramount interest in 
Union. It is to reconcile these conflicting interests, to harmonize 
these jarring elements that our common Constitution was estab 
lished, and for this our government should be administered. The 
Constitution itself was, as all acknowledge, the result of com 
promise and mutual concession. The alterations in it which may 
be rendered necessary from time to time, and the administration 
of the laws under it, ought then to be distinguished by the same 
spirit. If, therefore, any part of the Constitution is found by ex 
perience to bear with peculiar hardship upon one part of the 
nation; or to be impracticable in its execution, or unjust and im 
moral in its necessary consequences; or by the lapse of time and by 
events that have happened subsequent to its formation rendered 
improper and oppressive, they who suffer under its operation are 
fully authorized by the Constitution itself to ask for an alteration, 
and may reasonably hope from the justice of their sister states 
that their complaints will be heard and their wrongs redressed, 
though some other partial local or momentary interest should 
stand arrayed against their claims. 



i8o 4 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 89 

It is on these solid grounds that the legislature of Massachusetts 
solicit a revisal and amendment of that part of the Constitution 
which prescribes the proportion of representation in the other 
house of Congress, allowed to the respective states. It is the belief 
of that legislature that the ratio of representation as at preeent 
established is: 

1. Burdensome in its operation on far the greatest part of the 
Union; 

2. Unjust, immoral and impolitic in its necessary consequences; 

3. That events subsequent to the adoption of the Constitu 
tion have made and are daily making it more and more objec 
tionable; 

4. And that it has been found by experience impracticable in its 
execution. 

I. In examining the principle upon which this ratio of representa 
tion is founded, we shall find it contains within itself an essential 
source of discord and not of harmony; it professedly makes num- 
bers the measure of representation. But numbers of what? Of free 
inhabitants? This would undoubtedly be upon the principles of 
pure republicanism, the only answer to the question, and would to 
God this were the answer we could make. No, sir. The answer 
must be double for one portion of the Union, numbers of free 
inhabitants; and for another portion of the Union, numbers of 
slaves, cut up into fractions and mingled with the numbers of their 
masters. Here then to form the immediate representatives of the 
people, the people themselves are divided into two classes, and 
those who hold slaves are invested with exclusive privileges, denied 
to those who are only independent freemen. Such is the real 
meaning of the paragraph of which we propose the repeal, though 
expressed in circumlocutions, as if the Constitution was ashamed 
or afraid to speak in plain terms its own meaning. At the present 
moment the delegation from ten of those states in the House of 
Representatives is composed of members chosen by the numbers 
of free inhabitants. The representations to which the numbers of 
slaves contribute are sent from only seven states. Those seven 



90 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

states then possess the advantage of a double representation, to the 
manifest detriment and injury of the other ten. 

Such a mode of representation is therefore unjust, inasmuch as 
it is unequal. It is unjust, because it establishes inequality of 
rights, and of the rights the most precious in the sight of freemen 
between fellow citizens of the same community. It is also an in 
equality in the highest degree immoral and impolitic. Its immoral 
ity is derived from its conferring the first of political privileges upon 
the basis of the greatest outrage on the rights of mankind. The 
immorality of slavery itself has been so clearly proved by the in 
vestigation of numerous writers in modern ages, that even those 
who exercise that dominion over their fellow men have themselves 
generally admitted that it is an offence against the laws of nature 
and of God. And yet our present mode of representation, by mak 
ing the numbers of slaves a component part of the right to vote, 
holds out a strong and, as we plainly see, an irresistible temptation 
to those states which allow slavery, to increase and multiply as 
much as possible the number of these unhappy beings. To set this 
argument in a clearer light, let us only for a moment consider the 
inconsistency between this part of your Constitution and the laws 
of the country. The Constitution, as has already been remarked, 
holds out a reward to the slave-holding states for every additional 
slave they import. It promises them for every five thousand 
negroes introduced from Africa, three thousand and more votes 
added to them for electing a member of Congress, and a President 
and Vice President of the United States. It is giving them a 
bounty, a high and most alluring bounty, upon the importation of 
slaves, and so careful is the Constitution to secure the right of 
claiming this bounty, that it has expressly denied to Congress the 
power of prohibiting such importations prior to the year 1808. 
Such is the language of the Constitution. But what is the language 
of the laws? 

By an act of Congress passed on the 22nd of March, 1794, every 
citizen of the United States, or person residing within the same, is 
prohibited from fitting out, building, owning, equipping, loading 



i8o 4 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 91 

or otherwise preparing any ship or vessel within the United States, 
for the purpose of carrying on any trade or traffic in slaves to any 
foreign country, on penalty of the forfeiture of the ship and a for 
feiture of two thousand dollars. And if any citizen of the United 
States receives slaves on board a vessel for the purpose of such 
traffic, he forfeits $200 for every person so received. 

By another act passed 10 May, 1800, every citizen of the United 
States is forbidden, directly or indirectly, to hold any rights or 
property in any vessel employed in such traffic, on penalty of the 
forfeiture of all such property, and of double the value of it besides, 
and double the value of his interest in the slaves. Every citizen 
for merely serving on board a vessel employed in such traffic is 
made liable to $2,000 fine and two years imprisonment. 

Now, sir, upon what principle is it, that all this burden of pen 
alties, forfeitures, fines and imprisonment, is inflicted upon our 
citizens, for merely having an interest in this trade, or contributing 
to it by personal service? Abstracted from its inherent and indel 
ible immorality which, God forbid, I should ever attempt to 
justify; but abstracted from that, it is a traffic of the most lucrative 
nature, a traffic which might advantageously employ the industry 
and enterprise of great numbers of our citizens, a branch of trade 
in which the balance would be all of clear profit to our country, a 
traffic which at all events will be carried on by other trading na 
tions, and on which all our pains and penalties can have no other 
effect than to secure to those other nations all the advantages from 
which we exclude our own citizens? Upon what principle, I say, 
can all this tempest of indignation against a most profitable com 
merce be founded, in a nation so essentially commercial as ours, 
but upon the consideration that the trade itself is, and ever must 
be, a heinous crime in the sight of God, and therefore ought to be 
so in the sight of man? Let us suppose, sir, that an impartial and 
philosophical foreigner, with the example and the profound pene 
tration of a Montesquieu, should take up our statute book with a 
view to discover in it the spirit of our laws. Suppose him first to 
examine the Constitution, and see with what jealous and inflexible 



92 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

care the right of trafficking in slaves is reserved to one part of the 
Union, and guarded even against the general authority of the na 
tion. Then imagine him to remark the high reward offered for the 
increase of this trade, to observe that the slave traders had stipu 
lated for an increase of their dearest political privileges in exact 
proportion to the energy and vigor with which they should drive 
this trade. I ask not what his own moral feelings would inspire into 
his mind, but as to the character of the people who inserted such 
articles into their social compact, would he not draw from it as an 
irresistible inference that the slave trade was an object of darling 
affection to that people? Then let him cast his eyes over the two 
statutes, the substance of which I have just now stated. Let him 
reflect upon the enterprising commercial genius of the nation, 
upon the peculiar allurements of the commerce itself, and how will 
he account for the pointed detestation and abhorrence with which 
it is prescribed? Could such a man enter this hall, would he not 
call upon us for an explanation of this strange inconsistency be 
tween our Constitution and our laws; between the charter under 
which we act, and our acts under the charter? Should we attempt 
to justify the provision of the Constitution, would not his finger 
pointed to the laws reduce us to silence? Should we presume to 
account for the laws from the criminality of that which they forbid, 
would he not by a glance at the Constitution put us all to the 
blush? Would he not say, if the slave trade is criminal, why have 
you placed it under such extraordinary protection? If innocent, 
why have you put it under such a bitter anathema? The spirit of 
the laws should be consistent in right or in wrong. But you have 
taken the greatest pains to pronounce your own condemnation, 
and have made your own laws the severest stigma upon your own 
Constitution. But if a speculative observer must be struck with 
wonder at this glaring inconsistency in our national code, would he 
not be as much surprised at the inequality of condition under 
which these contradictory regulations place the different sections 
of the Union ? He would perceive that the slave trade, with all its 
evils and all its guilt, is possessed of the two advantages which 



1804] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 93 

peculiarly recommend it to certain passions of the human heart. 
To the southern planter it furnishes hands for the cultivation of his 
soil. And to the eastern merchant and seaman it furnishes em 
ployment for shipping and commercial capital. To both it is a 
source of wealth but under different circumstances. The planter 
derives no benefit from the trade until the slaves are landed upon 
our shores. The merchant s profits are limited to their purchase 
in Africa and their transportation over the seas. The benefit to 
one interest ceases where the other begins. In restraining the trade 
of slaves to foreign countries the slave owners in this country 
make no sacrifice; on the contrary their pecuniary interest may be 
promoted by its interdiction. For if it were fostered by a premium, 
they are not a seafaring people and could not share in the profits. 
And by obstructing the sale of slaves to other countries they may 
perhaps obtain a more abundant and cheaper supply for them 
selves. This is the only point of view in which the seeming incon 
sistencies between the laws and the Constitution can be removed. 
Both tend to favor the interests of the slave owners among our 
selves. Both tend to depress the interests of the rest. The lan 
guage of the Constitution and laws where combined appears to be 
no other than this. We, the slave owners, will suffer nothing to 
impede our purchase of slaves to the full extent of our purses and 
our credit. And in order to have the market exclusively to our 
selves we will seize, confiscate, fine and imprison without mercy, 
for every attempt to carry or sell slaves elsewhere. But surely, 
sir, if this be the spirit of our laws, it must be confessed a spirit of 
injustice and inequality in the extreme. 

Nor is the impolicy of this pointed and invidious encouragement 
to the multiplication of slaves within the United States less ap 
parent than its injustice. For the possession of those we have al 
ready, perhaps in the eyes of justice and humanity we might offer 
some palliation. I remember that at the last session of Congress a 
very respectable member of the house told us, that for a long time 
before our Revolution the legislature of Virginia had made unavail 
ing efforts to prohibit the importation of slaves into that colony, 



94 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

but that [by] the influence of the dealers in the trade, the Liverpool 
merchants, the royal sanction, had always been denied to every 
such law. As far then as the evil had been imposed upon us, we 
may derive excuse if not justification from that necessity. But 
surely we have enough and too many of that description of persons 
in our country already. Surely we ought not to give encourage 
ment to a species of population which must ever prove to the na 
tion a burden and not an aid. In the event of a foreign invasion 
we cannot expect to see them assume any other character than as 
auxiliaries of a foreign foe. In their present condition they are a 
secret but deadly enemy in the heart of our own country. They 
wait but for the moment when they can have the power of hostility 
in their hands. They have all been taught, and incredible as it 
would appear, their masters have been the most assiduous in teach 
ing them that slavery is a state of perpetual and inextinguishable 
war. That the right of man to liberty is unalienable. That when 
ever they have it in their power, it is their right and their duty to 
cancel the bonds of their subjection, and break the chains upon 
the heads of their oppressors. That heaven and earth would con 
cur to sanction their insurrection, and that in such a contest the 
Almighty has no attribute that could side with us in the cause. 
Can it be imagined that these doctrines have been so long and so 
zealously inculcated, without winning their way to the hearts of 
men so powerfully stimulated by every passion to believe them? 
And is it not blindness of the most fatal kind to spur by constitu 
tional temptation this continual augmentation of their numbers? 

Do I hear it asserted in answer to all this that the Constitution 
has settled these questions? That, as it was an instrument of com 
promise, the representation for slaves was a concession to the South 
ern states. That they held it indispensable for preserving the bal 
ance of power, and that they cannot be expected to surrender an 
advantage which was fairly obtained? To this I reply that the 
course of events since the formation of the Constitution has given 
a peculiar propriety to the change which the legislature of Massa 
chusetts have instructed us to ask. If a double representation was

necessary to the Southern states to preserve the balance of power 
seventeen years ago, it has already become unnecessary by the 
relative superiority of increase in their population since that time. 
And every argument arising from the necessity of a balance which 
then could tend to require an additional share of representation for 
those states, must apply with equal force now to induce them to 
place themselves on a footing of equality with their sisters. The 
rapidity of their growth so far exceeds that of the eastern states, 
when combined with the accessions they derive from the western 
part of the Union, that independent of their negroes they have now 
acquired the ascendancy in the proportion of numbers, and that 
ascendancy will become from year to year more decisive. This 
was apparently foreseen at the time when the Constitution was 
adopted, and the very regulations of the Constitution guarding 
against restraints on the importation of slaves, and against direct 
taxes on other proportions than those of the census, are evidently 
founded on such anticipations. The very stipulation against 
changes in these points prior to a given period evince an opinion, 
that when the time should have clasped those changes might and 
probably would become advisable, as well as the opinion of the 
states most interested in the subject that they might, after such 
lapse of time, be made with perfect safety to them. 

Another consideration upon which the states which have no 
slaves or no representation for slaves may reasonably require to 
stand on equal ground with the other is the character which our 
national administration has given to this Confederation under the 
present government. To support the burdens of the government 
and for the discharge of the national debt, it was obviously con 
templated at the formation of the Constitution that some other 
mode of taxation besides duties of impost and on navigation would 
necessarily be resorted to. It has, however, gradually become ex 
clusively the policy of the government to lay the whole load of 
taxation upon that single resource. The direct tax, which has but 
once been attempted, 1 was found so obnoxious to those very states 
1 A direct tax of $2,000,000, imposed under the law of July 14, 1798. 



96 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

which on the basis of payment under this tax alone for their negroes 
have a double share of representation, that in two of them it has 
been found impossible to raise their assessment of it. And the 
internal taxes, which contributed heretofore in some degree to the 
revenues of the country, have been so dissatisfactory to our present 
administration, that they have been all repealed, to heap on the 
load of impost, too heavily aggravated before, an additional sum 
fully equal to their proceeds. Thus, sir, the whole revenues of the 
United States, as far as they are a burden upon the people, are now 
collected from the commercial states alone. The ten states which 
have no representation for slaves in the councils of the Union, in 
the year 1802, the latest of which we have the documents, con 
tributed three-fourths of the net revenue collected by impost, ton 
nage and navigation. And the seven states, whose slaves count 
to make members of Congress, contributed only one-fourth. Or to 
be more perfectly accurate, the whole amount of net revenue col 
lected from that source throughout the United States was 
$8,359,227.96 of which sum $6,103,898.69 was collected in the ten 
slaveless states. This is the proportion of taxation and contribu 
tion to the public burdens. Now what is the proportion of repre 
sentation for the same states. They have only seventy-eight 
members in the House of Representatives, where the others have 
sixty-four, fifteen of whom are added in consequence of the black 
population. Thus the same portion of the Union which contributes 
in the proportion of three to one, shares the representation largely 
in the proportion of seven to six. Should the genuine republican 
principle of representation proportioned to the numbers of free in 
habitants be established, the same states, who would thereby lose 
fifteen members, would still be highly favored in their portion, 
since they would be represented in the ratio of two to three, while 
their tribute to the treasury would be only as one to three. 

A final and decisive reason, however, which appears to dictate 
the change which we request in the Constitution, is that by ex 
perience it has been proved that the provisions of the Constitution 
in this article are impracticable of execution. The Constitution 



1804] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 97 

has here indissolubly connected together the proportions of direct 
taxation and representation; the one of these provisions is made as 
the consideration of the other, and indeed the expressions used 
are such as to make of both parts only one compounded proposi 
tion. Representation and direct taxation shall be apportioned in 
one and the same manner. If one part of the provision then is 
found impracticable, the whole must of course be so considered. 
The attempt has been made and has failed. A direct tax has once 
been assessed, but has never been levied on those very states which 
derive the largest accession to the representative part of the regu 
lation from the numbers of their slaves. Hence, as the Constitu 
tion now stands, it bears with fourfold hardship on the states 
without representation of slaves. Of all revenues raised on the 
Union by indirect taxation three-fourths are levied upon them, and 
instead of paying less of direct taxes than their sisters they pay 
more. Nay, should such a tax ever again be resorted to they must 
expect to pay the whole. For the example of South Carolina and 
Georgia has proved that the government has not the power to 
raise the tax, where there is an unwillingness to pay it, and such an 
example is too alluring not to find multitudes of imitators. I must 
be permitted to dwell with a peculiar stress upon this fact; the 
non-payment of the direct tax in South Carolina and Georgia has 
not been occasioned by their inability. Blest with a mild and 
genial climate and a fertile soil, they have always enjoyed the 
advantage of producing the articles which constitute the richest 
source of our wealth, and within a few years they have added to 
their riches the incalculably valuable article of cotton. In our 
eastern states the climate is severe, the soil comparatively barren. 
Nature treats us like a stepmother, and throws us upon the world 
with a double portion of the original curse to which man was 
doomed, of earning his bread in the sweat of his brow. Besides 
the toils to which we are destined for subsistence, we must submit 
to other toils for guarding against the inclemency of the season. 
While the Carolinian may bask in the rays of a genial sun nearly 
the whole year round, the New Englandman must employ one-half 



98 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

of it to preserve himself and his cattle from perishing during the 
other. Instead of that luxuriant vegetation which furnishes the 
materials for luxurious life, his own lands will not even yield him 
bread of a finer grain than the native maize; he must purchase from 
the South that first of all articles of subsistence, and depend upon 
other climes and regions than his own for the staff of life. The 
rapidity and greatness of increase of wealth among the citizens of 
South Carolina and Georgia during the last two years has been 
a subject of universal notoriety and of general congratulation 
throughout the Union; and yet it is in the midst of this unexampled 
and unrivalled prosperity that the government has been unable in 
those very states to raise a small direct tax, which from the slave- 
less states has been exacted to the utmost cent. 

To the states whose slaves contribute to their representation 
another inducement may be urged for resigning this unequal privi 
lege. By the new acquisition of Louisiana they have an early 
prospect of adding another state with its equal number of Senators 
in this body, and with a rapidly increasing number of members for 
the other branch of the legislature. From the nature of the country 
and its innumerable attractions to settlement it may reasonably be 
expected that in the course of a few years, instead of one state they 
will branch into five or six. All these will of course throw their 
whole weight into the scale of that influence which belongs to the 
southern section of the Union. This was certainly never contem 
plated at the formation of our national compact, and it will un 
doubtedly suffice to give the states possessing slaves an ascendancy 
in the affairs of the country which ought to satisfy them. And 
when we consider that the price we are to pay for the purchase of 
that country, principal and interest, is already charged upon our 
duties of impost and tonnage upon these very revenues of which 
the ten slaveless states furnish three-fourths it must appear the 
most cruel of hardships thus in a manner to lay upon them the 
whole burden of acquisition which is to annihilate all their weight 
and influence, and to leave their interests wholly at the mercy of 
the rest. 



1804] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 99 

Among the objections which have been made against this meas 
ure it has been said, that the representation for slaves was given 
as an equivalent for the equal representation of the states in the 
Senate; that it was a concession of the small to the large states; 
and in some of the newspaper discussions upon the subject the ad 
vocates of the slavish representation have with some exultation 
offered to give up this privilege, on condition that the representa 
tion in the Senate shall be proportioned according to numbers, like 
that in the other house. If this argument is offered with sincerity, 
it only proves that those who advance it are very bad proficients 
in common arithmetic. I speak of its sincerity as problematical, 
because every man who has attentively considered our Constitution 
must know that equal representation in the Senate was a point 
reserved as a sine qua non by the small states, upon which they were 
determined to listen to no compromise whatsoever. This and this 
alone they insisted upon placing beyond the reach even of a Con 
stitutional amendment. It was the only remnant of their sover 
eignty which they retained under the new government of the 
Union, and its equivalent is to be found not in the representation 
of slaves, but in the proportionate representation of numbers in the 
other house, and in the manner of electing the executive. Now the 
principle of representation in proportion is not at all affected by the 
amendment which we are instructed to propose, and which my 
colleague has offered. Far from infringing upon the principle of 
proportion its only object is to establish it upon a fair and equal 
basis to make the numbers of representatives correspond with 
the numbers of their constituents. 

But a clear proof that the equal representation in the Senate 
was not a concession on the part of the slave-holding states to 
those who have no slaves is that they themselves, the slave owners, 
are the gainers by that very equal representation. A simple process 
by the rule of three will show this. Under the rule of equal repre 
sentation in the Senate the ten states without slaves have twenty 
members in this body. The seven others have fourteen. Now if 
the slavish three-fifths were abolished, and the representation in 



ioo THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

both houses was proportioned to numbers of free inhabitants; if 
the ratio in the Senate were such as to give the ten slaveless states 
the same number of members they now have, that is, twenty, the 
seven other states would have only twelve, and of course would 
lose two members. If they should have fourteen members, their 
present number, then the ten states without slaves would have 
twenty-two members, and consequently gain two. If the whole 
number of senators should be the same as at present, thirty-four, 
the proportion would then be of one senator for every one hundred 
and twenty-eight thousand souls, which would give to the ten 
slaveless states twenty-one, and to the other seven, thirteen sen 
ators; or in other words the former would gain one, and the 
latter would lose one of their present numbers of senators. So 
that in either view of the subject the loss on the part of the slave 
owners, and the gain on the part of the other states, would be of 
two members, equivalent to the vote of one whole state. 



TO JOHN ADAMS 

24 December, 1804. 
DEAR SIR: 

When I expressed a wish in writing to my brother, that 
you should purposely dismiss some part of that attention to 
the present course of public affairs which I thought con 
tributed much to make your hours unpleasant, I was not 
aware that your expectations of change in the politics of a 
considerable portion of the States, more favorable to the 
real interests and morals of the country, were so sanguine. 
As change is the only permanent characteristic feature in our 
governments and constitutions, I cannot pretend to dispute 
the possibility of such an event. But as change for the worse 
has been for many years uniform and unvaried in its progress, 
as it still continues with increasing violence and rapidity, and 
as I see no source from which a turn towards change of a 



1804] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 101 

more propitious character can be foreseen with any color of 
reason, I cannot say that any of my anticipations are of a 
complexion so fair as those which afford you comfort amid 
the present lowering aspect of things. I have indeed a 
consolation of a different sort. I believe the growth and 
prosperity of this country to rest upon such foundations 
that all the vices and follies of the people or of their govern 
ments, be they what they may, will not be able to counteract 
them. This prosperity which is founded upon our situation 
and the course of nature I rely upon with great confidence; 
but as much as I depend upon the dispensations of Provi 
dence, just so little is my confidence in the wisdom and virtue 
of men. 

Hitherto the session of Congress has been remarkable 
more for its inactivity than anything else. The object of 
principal expectation is the impeachment of Mr. Chase, who 
is summoned to make his appearance before the Senate the 
second day of next month. The bills for preserving peace 
in the ports and harbors, for regulating the clearance of 
armed vessels, and for establishing a prize court in the 
Mediterranean, have not yet got through the House of 
Representatives. They are liable to considerable objection, 
and are found upon discussion liable to greater objections - 
than appear to have been anticipated. I dislike them all 
three, though I believe something ought to be done upon 
each of the cases to which they apply. 

Our proposition for an amendment to the Constitution has 
not yet been taken up, and indeed it probably will have no 
discussion this session. So many of the state legislatures 
have already declared against it, without one instance of 
adoption or approbation, not even by Connecticut, that it 
would be absurd to spend time in haranguing upon it here. 
The time will come when its real merits will meet proper 



102 THE WRITINGS OF [1804 

investigation. But at present the people of Massachusetts 
themselves appear to have disavowed the act of their own 
legislature supporting their rights and interests. What 
they do not choose to ask, they may rest assured their 
neighbors will not be anxious to grant. 

General Turreau, the French Minister, is in great distress 
on account of his wife, Secretary, and part of his family, 
who sailed from Nantes for New York more than three 
months ago, and have not been heard of. He has with him 
only an aid-de-camp, a young man by name of Mann, ap 
parently qualified for certain parts of diplomatic duty to an 
extraordinary degree. His department of negotiation must 
be intended to be among the ladies. Fashions, amusements, 
dress, and everything relating to the bon ton de la societe, he 
understands to perfection and descants upon with great 
eloquence. He is also a great musical performer, singer and 
composer; a soldier, withal, who has fought all the Italian 
campaigns with the Emperor, and an Adonis in dress and 
manners. He is already quite an intimate in all the musical 
families, and of course in ours. I have had conversation 
with him on the state of things in his country, and find him 
as capable of serious reflection and acute observation upon 
subjects of importance as upon trifles. 

I have had this morning a little wrestling bout with our 
present sovereign, Mr. Giles, who rules without control as 
Lord of the ascendant. He has been plunging us from one 
absurdity to another, until we had got so deep that it was 
impossible to bear it any longer. The history of the morn 
ing s debate would be curious, but too long to detail to you 
at present. 1 I moved a very simple and trivial amendment, 
which happened to touch upon his most irritable tendon 
and brought his majority into great perplexity between the 

1 Adams, Memoirs, December 24, 1804. 



i8o 4 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 103 

absolute necessity of making the amendment which I pro 
posed, and the equally absolute necessity of avoiding to aid 
or abet me in mutiny against his authority. What think 
you was the final expedient? The same which Plutarch 
tells us was once practised in Athens. You remember, when 
a proposition was made by a citizen of an infamous char 
acter (that is, I suppose he was of the minority}, Aristides, I 
think it was, considered it so useful in itself, but so disgraced 
by the introducer, that he moved the same proposition should 
be introduced by a respectable citizen. Now in order to make 
it possible for the majority to vote for my proposition against 
Mr. Giles, General Jackson, and I was much obliged to him 
for it, undertook the part of the respectable citizen and 
introduced my amendment by a mere variation of phrase, 
whereby it carried a large majority. This is the first time 
Giles has got a trip this session, and he will not forget it. He 
has been very pointed in his civility to me, out of doors, and 
in conversation whenever we have met. I am thankful to 
him for even this. His power is such that if he should move 
my expulsion from the Senate because he does not like my 
looks, he would stand a very fair chance of success. But 
he has nothing insolent in his manner, which cannot be said 
of all his associates. 

We have had a proposal to adjourn over this week, but it 
did not succeed. We are to meet again on Wednesday. 
Yours faithfully.

TO JOHN ADAMS 

WASHINGTON, 5 January, 1805. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

Mr. Giles continues to be our Director, and in general 
meets with little opposition to what he thinks beneficial to 
the public service. He has lost much of the vehemence in his 
manner which struck me when I first heard him speak in 
public, in 1791. And he treats his opponents with a very 
pointed civility. I wish his principles had moderated in pro 
portion to his manners. 

The Vice President 1 is treated by his former friends with 
a degree of distinction and respect to which he had before 
this session long been a stranger. His case is held out as 
being eminently entitled to compassion. He seems to be 
under a deeper personal obligation to one member of the 
Senate 2 than from his situation he ought to be, and the 
effect of this obligation is too perceptible on his conduct as 
President. 

I am, etc. 

TO JOHN ADAMS 

WASHINGTON, 24 January, 1805. 

Though I find it utterly impossible ever to read all these 
papers [public documents], yet I feel it an indispensable 
duty to peruse with attention the greater part of them, and 
some of them require even a larger portion of time than that. 

1 Burr. 

2 Giles. 



JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 105 

When to this you add the necessary attendance upon my 
duty in the Senate, and the part which the same sense of 
duty leads me to take in many of its deliberations, I hope 
you will acquit me of any neglect arising either from indo 
lence, or from an underestimate of the advantages I derive 
from your letters. It is indeed possible that I may indulge 
a solicitude too anxious for my personal and political situa 
tion, with respect to the business which comes before Con 
gress. Most of the gentlemen, with whom I must commonly 
concur in opinion, seem to think that we may as well discard 
in a great degree our concern relative to the public business, 
as we can be under no responsibility, and as nothing we can 
say or do will ever be of any avail to the service. There 
appears to me, however, some danger in this listless abandon 
ment of the affairs of the nation, and if little or no good can 
be done by the most assiduous of our exertions, I think we 
have the experience that much mischief may be prevented. 

Your fundamental principles for pointing out the proper 
organization of government, that it is to control and direct 
the operations of emulation, I fully believe, and on the theory 
of government generally, to judge of the depth and compass 
of knowledge, genius and virtue among the statesmen who 
have made constitutions for these states, I believe you 
could have nothing to wish but a comparison of the Massa 
chusetts constitution with any other that ever has been 
made in this country. To this comparative estimate I have 
recently been called by having my attention called to the 
collection of our constitutions, with relation to a different 
subject. The only part of your system upon which a doubt 
in my mind remains, is whether the balance, in its most per 
fect state, is so efficacious to control the effects of emulation, 
as you suppose. 

I have never in my gloomiest moments considered my 



106 THE WRITINGS OF [1805 

situation as of so trying or severe a nature as was yours 
during the whole period of our revolutionary controversy; 
but you had the advantage of a great and powerful consola 
tion which totally fails to me, and that was, the honor and 
profit which you never failed to derive from your profession. 
I have had experience and acquired self-knowledge enough 
to be convinced that from my profession neither profit nor 
honor will ever derive to me. Not that I reluct at any toil 
of mind or body, not being conscious that the dread or aver 
sion of labor is among my deficiencies; but that from both 
natural and adventitious circumstances in my composition 
and life, the bar is not my element. 

We are here in a state of momentary calm, which perhaps 
may be the presage of a violent storm. The recession of the 
District of Columbia has taken four days debate in the House 
of Representatives, and then rejected by a large majority. 
The clearance bill entirely renovated will probably come for 
discussion again next week. Mr. Crowninshield has also of 
fered a resolution which will furnish materials, if not for leg 
islation, at least for eloquent speeches. On the 4th of next 
month is to come on the trial of the impeachment. If this 
proceeds, it will probably suspend in a great degree all the 
other business of the session. 



TO JOHN ADAMS 

WASHINGTON, 8 March, 1805. 
DEAR SIR: 

During the last days of the session of Congress which has 
just expired, I found it impossible to continue the corre 
spondence which I had previously maintained even so far as 
to enclose from day to day the public documents as they were 



i8o 5 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 107 

printed. From ten o clock in the morning until seven in the 
evening the Senate was constantly in session, with the in 
terval of only half an hour each day for a slight collation, 
which the members took at the Capitol itself; and this, to 
gether with a walk of an hour to reach that place, and a walk 
of an hour to return from it, scarcely left me the hours of the 
night for repose. The scene has now closed. On Sunday 
evening last, the 3rd instant, at half past nine o clock, the 
two Houses adjourned without day, arid thus terminated a 
session which it was high time to bring to an end; a session 
which has been the parent of several legislative acts, im 
portant in themselves and promising still more important 
consequences. The attention both of Congress and of the 
public to these has, however, been almost swallowed up in 
the interest and anxiety with which every step of the judicial 
transactions, which have engrossed, so large a portion of our 
time, has been followed and scrutinized. On the subject of 
Mr. Chase s impeachment, until the sentence was pro 
nounced, I felt myself under an obligation to impose absolute 
silence upon my pen, and, as far as human infirmity would 
admit, upon my tongue. Even now, it is a subject upon 
which it would perhaps be most discreet for those who were 
called to decide upon the articles to observe a dignified and 
unaffected silence. The questions of guilt or innocence as 
they affect the man are probably at rest; but the spirit 
which impelled to the prosecution, and in which its highest 
importance consisted, is so far from being subdued or 
abashed, that you will perceive it has burst forth with re 
doubled violence from its defeat, and finding itself baffled 
by an unexpected resistance to the stroke it aimed at judicial 
independence, has not only taken a more pointed and deadly 
aim at that, but coupled it with another blow directed at the 
Senate itself. These will probably be the subject of future 



io8 THE WRITINGS OF [1805 

contestation, and may perhaps bring to the test the validity 
of some principles upon which our constitutions stand, and 
which have never yet been tried by the touchstone of ex 
perience. 

The attack by impeachment upon the judicial department 
of our national government began two years ago, and has 
been conducted with great address as well as with persever 
ing violence. The impeachment and conviction of Mr. Pick 
ering, of a man notoriously and confessedly insane, for acts 
committed in that state, and during the whole course of the 
impeachment remaining in it, was but a preparatory step 
to the assault upon Judge Chase, as this in its turn was un 
questionably intended to pave the way for another prosecu 
tion, which would have swept the supreme judicial bench 
clean at a stroke. As the experiment in the case of Mr. 
Pickering was completely successful, I confess I have been 
disappointed, agreeably disappointed, in the issue of the suc 
ceeding step. It was impossible to establish by a stronger 
case than that, the principle that criminality was not an 
essential ingredient of impeachable offenses. And upon the 
score of humanity it would have been certainly a much less 
odious transaction to convict and remove a man of the first 
parts, after a full and solemn trial for peccadilloes of temper 
stretched into crimes and misdemeanors, than to pass a like 
degrading and defaming sentence upon one visited with the 
heaviest of human calamities, and to make that awful visita 
tion of God itself the basis of the prosecution. I can, indeed, 
never reflect upon the proceedings and judgments in that 
cruel affair without dejection of heart and humiliation of 
spirit. I feel for the honor of the body to which I belong, 
and for the honor of my country, sullied as they are by a 
sentence of guilt, inflicted upon a man for being among the 
most miserable of the human race, for being bereft by the 



i8o 5 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 109 

hand of heaven of that attribute, which by rendering man 
rational would render him accountable. Nor can I satis 
factorily explain to myself how it has happened, that the 
same men, who would be prevailed upon to sanction by a 
judgment pronounced under oath what to my mind appears 
so flagrant a violation of all justice and decency, should now 
stop and make an effectual stand in support of fair and 
honorable principle against this inroad of turbulent ambition. 
There is indeed one way of solving the difficulty which some 
times presents itself to my mind as probable, and which, if 
just, may be a foundation for substantial hope in future. 
The trial of Pickering did not sufficiently develop the in 
tentions of those by whom it was managed. It did not dis 
close the full extent of their views. But when it was seen 
that on the very day of his conviction the impeachment of 
Mr. Chase was voted, and when the application of those 
absurd doctrines upon which he had been construed into a 
criminal was instantly extended to a judge of the Supreme 
Court, with undisguised intimations that it would soon be 
spread over the whole of that Bench, some of those whose 
weakness had yielded to the torrent of popular prejudice in 
the first instance, had the integrity to reflect, rallied all their 
energy to assist them, and took a stand which has arrested, 
for a time that factious impetuosity that threatens to bury 
all our national institutions in one common ruin. 

There were circumstances in the case of Mr. Pickering 
which might at once contribute to veil the designs of his 
prosecutors, and to apologize for the compliance of his 
judges. The acts for which he was impeached were com 
mitted in a state of intoxication, and although it was abun 
dantly proved that his habits of this nature were produced 
by the alienation of his mind into which he had fallen, and 
only aggravated its symptoms, yet there was some color for 



i io THE WRITINGS OF [1805 

considering a man whom his family and friends suffered to 
go at large and take his seat on the Bench, as justly answer 
able for his conduct there. The end too must go some way 
in that instance to justify the means. For the office of a 
judge Mr. Pickering was utterly disqualified, and as the 
sentence went only to removal, the effect worked no injus 
tice and might reconcile to the irregularity of the process. 
Besides all this, it must be added that the judgment was 
obtained with great difficulty, and after more than one in 
ternal struggle in the party to pursue a more honorable course 
of proceeding. Three members of the Senate, adherents of 
the present administration, purposely absented themselves 
on the day when the sentence passed. Others had absented 
themselves still earlier, probably from the same motive, and 
his conviction was finally effected by a bare majority of the 
whole Senate. Of those who remained and voted I am cer 
tain several voted with extreme reluctance, and by a sacrifice 
of their own judgments to the domineering dictates of the 
managers from the House, and an unreflected acquiescence 
in the doctrines which were then first advanced, that im 
peachment, though for crimes and misdemeanors, was not a 
criminal prosecution, a doctrine which they were content to 
take for sound, as it suited the purpose for which it was then 
wanted, and the consequences of which they did not then 
stay to investigate. 

It is even possible that the proceedings on that trial may 
have tended to produce an effect of counteraction upon that 
of the present session. At least the doctrine concerning im 
peachment then broached, and which Pickering s sentence 
seemed to sanction, was at the commencement of this session 
carried to such an extreme, that its first check was seen in a 
glaring absurdity of its own detection. We were seriously 
told in long and studied speeches that impeachment, so far 



i8o S ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS in 

from being a criminal prosecution, was no prosecution at all. 
That the Senate, sitting for the purpose of trying impeach 
ment, was not a court, and that it ought not to derive its 
forms or rules of proceeding, either from courts of impeach 
ment in other countries, or from any of the judicial courts 
in our own. It was even intimated that not much pleading 
ought to be allowed, and a hint sufficiently explicit was 
given, that a general issue, a mere declaration of " not guilty," 
was the only answer which ought to be received to the articles 
charged by the House of Representatives. Conformably to 
these opinions the word "court" was, in two instances at 
least, struck out of the rules for proceeding in cases of im 
peachment, reported by a committee at an early period of 
the session. It was, however, necessary that the witnesses 
should be sworn. The committee who reported the rules 
had not proposed by whom the oath should be administered. 
A motion was therefore made in Senate that this act should 
be performed by the Secretary. It gave rise to no small de 
bates, for upon the principles which were so rapidly thriving 
and until then so irresistible prevailing, the Secretary had no 
authority to administer an oath, and the objection was taken 
on that ground. Nay, a proposal was formally made, that 
on the trial an ordinary magistrate should be called in to 
administer the oaths. Of this debate I gave you some 
account at the time when it occurred. It was the first 
stumbling-block to the new theory of impeachment, which 
has never recovered from the fall of that shock. When the 
natural and spontaneous deductions from the system had 
brought the Senate to this dilemma, of being bound to try 
an impeachment without possessing the power of administer 
ing an oath, the sturdiest of its followers began to stagger. 
The term "Court of Impeachment" was suffered to remain 
unexpun-ged from the Journals, though its expulsion was re- 



ii2 THE WRITINGS OF [1805 

peatedly threatened. The necessary oaths were administered 
by the Secretary, and an answer containing something more 
than a bare plea of "not guilty" was received without ob 
jection. 

The trial itself was conducted with exemplary order, 
decorum and solemnity. A great mass of illegal and improper 
evidence was indeed admitted, but that was always by con 
sent of the parties. Not only the casual expressions dropped 
in private conversations among friends and intimates, as well 
as strangers and adversaries, in the recess of a bed-chamber 
as well as at public taverns and in stage coaches, had been 
carefully and malignantly laid up and preserved for testi 
mony on this prosecution; not only more witnesses examined 
to points of opinion, and called upon for discrimination to 
such a degree as to say whether the deportment of the 
Judge was imperative or imperious, but hours of interroga 
tion and answer were consumed in evidence to looks, to 
bows, to tones of voice and modes of speech to prove the 
insufferable grievance that Mr. Chase had more than once 
raised a laugh at the expense of Callender s counsel, and to 
ascertain the tremendous fact that he had accosted the 
ATTORNEY GENERAL of Virginia by the appellation of 
Young Gentleman II If by thumbscrews, the memory of a 
witness trace back for a period of five years the features of 
the Judge s face, it could be darkened with a frown, it was 
to be construed into rude and contumelious treatment of the 
Virginia bar; if it was found lightened with a smile, "tyrants 
in all ages had been notorious for their pleasantry." In 
short, sir, Gravity himself could not keep his countenance 
at the nauseating littlenesses which were resorted to for proof 
of atrocious criminality, and indignation melted into ridicule 
at the puerile perseverance with which nothings were ac 
cumulated, with the hope of making something by their 



i8o S ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 113 

multitude. All this, however, was received because Judge 
Chase would not suffer his counsel to object against it. He 
indulged his accusers with the utmost license of investigation 
which they ever derived, and contented himself with ob 
serving to the court that he expected to be judged upon the 
legal evidence in the case. The hearing was fair and to all 
appearance impartial. The question whether impeachment 
could be had for acts not violating any law, was discussed 
and sifted, until the managers themselves were compelled 
to abandon it, at least in its application to the cause. The 
form of putting the final question which had been adopted 
in Pickering s case was abandoned, almost without a struggle, 
and another was substituted, conformable to the English 
precedents and to correct principles. It was taken on each 
of the eight articles separately. And although of the thirty- 
four Senators present (for not a member of the body was 
absent), twenty-five were decided political opponents of 
Mr. Chase, there were fifteen who voted for acquittal upon 
every article. On the first article, the one upon which the 
great reliance of the managers was placed, the only article 
which by its relation to a trial for life and death could give 
the gloom of darkness to the lightest shade of official error, 
the majority of the whole Senate was for acquittal, and two 
among the most inveterate of the judge s political antago 
nists appear among the names of those who pronounced him 
not guilty. The eighth article was that which united the 
greatest number of voices against him, and the whole sub 
stance of his offense in that was the delivery of a charge to a 
Grand Jury at Baltimore, containing political opinions ob 
noxious to the predominating sentiments of the day, and to 
the party now in power. This was certainly not a very pru 
dent act, but even the microscope of party spirit could not 
magnify it into an impeachable misdemeanor. The consti- 



1 1 4 THE WRITINGS OF [1805 

tutional majority necessary to convict could not be obtained 
for any of the charges separately, nor for the whole taken to 
gether, and by the voices of determined political adversaries 
Judge Chase was acquitted of all the Articles of Impeachment 
preferred against him by the House of Representatives of 
the United States. 



TO JOHN ADAMS 

WASHINGTON, 14 March, 1805. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

In my last letter I observed to you, that the form of putting 
the final question on the articles of impeachment against 
Judge Chase was varied from that which had been adopted 
in the case of Mr. Pickering, and made conformable to the 
English precedents. To show you how essentially this va 
riation of form was connected with a most important ques 
tion as to the nature of impeachment under our Constitution, 
I shall here state the difference between them. In Pickering s 
case the question was "Is John Pickering, District Judge of 

New Hampshire, guilty as charged in the Article ? " And 

the answer given was "aye," or "no." In Mr. Chase s case 
the question was "Is Samuel Chase, the respondent, guilty or 
not guilty of a high crime or misdemeanor as charged in the 
article just read?" And the answer was "guilty," or "not 
guilty." Thus in this instance every member of the court 
was by the form of the question called upon to say, not only 
whether the facts alleged in the article were proved, but 
whether they constituted a high crime or misdemeanor, 
whereas in the former case that very material point was 
winked out of sight. The members answered that John 
Pickering was guilty as the article alleged, but whether the 
facts amounted to a high crime or misdemeanor they did not 



i8o S ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 115 

undertake to say. One would scarcely conceive it possible 
that in such a body as the Senate of the United States the 
acquittal or conviction of a man should depend upon the 
form of words used for taking the opinion of the members 
on his guilt or innocence. But so it was. The same form 
used at the present time was proposed and strenuously con 
tended for in the former case, but was then inflexibly re 
jected. I told you that the precedent was now abandoned 
almost without a struggle, but it was not without very strong 
signs of reluctance; nor do I imagine it would have been 
given up, but that they, who were most earnestly bent upon 
the Judge s conviction, had sufficient indications to convince 
them that there was no prospect of such result from any 
form of question they could devise. On the very day the 
sentence was pronounced there was, indeed, a fresh attempt 
in Senate to prove that the power of impeachment under our 
Constitution was unlimited, and the power of conviction 
upon impeachment limited only by the proportion of num 
bers required to convict. But the bearing of the argument on 
the cause then to be determined was formally disavowed, 
because it was said at all events the articles charged against 
Mr. Chase were of high crimes or misdemeanors. This was 
not altogether true. For besides the frivolous nature of the 
charges contained in several of the articles, it is very remark 
able that one of them, differing from all the rest, had omitted 
even the allegation of evil intent. It does not pretend to 
charge anything more than an error on a point of law, and 
discards all the imputations of partiality, intemperance, 
oppression, injustice and solicitude to convict, with which 
all the other articles are so profusely laden. This omission 
cannot be presumed to have been unintentional, and the 
insertion of that and the next article (bottomed upon the 
very same grounds, but carefully resuming the allegations 



ii6 THE WRITINGS OF [1805 

of oppressive intent) afford the most unequivocal proofs of a 
determination to establish the principle, that judges are 
removable by impeachment for any mistake on a point of 
law. These two articles, it must also be remembered, were 
introduced as an after thought; were no part of the articles 
reported at the former session of Congress, and were now first 
brought forward after all the reflections and meditations of 
a seven months recess. These articles contained in them 
selves a virtual impeachment not only of Mr. Chase, but of 
all the judges of the Supreme Court from the first establish 
ment of the national judiciary. They were founded on the 
pretence that the federal courts were bound to follow in each 
state of the Union the modes of process usual in that state. 
Now one of the earliest decisions of the Supreme Court had 
been directly contrary to this position, and all the judges 
had uniformly proceeded in conformity to that decision. If 
Mr. Chase was removable by impeachment for having thus 
acted at Richmond, he had not an associate upon the Bench 
but was alike removable for having done the same thing 
elsewhere. The fate of these two articles and their construc 
tion furnishes a curious specimen of the manner in which 
public bodies may be brought to act. One of them, the fifth, 
impeached Judge Chase for issuing a capias against Callender, 
because it says the laws of Virginia required that a summons 
should issue. The very law of Virginia to which it appeals 
expressly authorizes the judges to issue in the cases to which 
it refers a summons, or other proper process. The article of 
impeachment omits these last words and, instead of a discre 
tionary alternative, recites the law in peremptory terms re 
quiring a summons. And yet upon this egregious misrecital 
of a statute as egregiously misapplied did the House of 
Representatives of the United States, by a majority of 
seventy votes against forty-five, vote an accusation against 



i8o 5 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 117 

one of the supreme judges of the land, upon which, had his 
judges been no more restrained than his accusers, he must 
have been disgraced in reputation and ignominiously expelled 
from his office. On this article the vote of acquittal was 
unanimous. The strong stimulus of political animosity, 
aided by all the perverse ingenuity of party spirit, could not 
devise an apology upon which a single man should dare to 
say "guilty" to this charge, which seventy members of the 
House of Representatives were not ashamed to sanction with 
their names upon the record of accusation. 

President Jefferson is reported to have said to a member 
of the Senate, that impeachment was but a clumsy engine to 
get rid of judges. His warmest friends in both houses of 
Congress are, I believe, by this time tolerably well convinced 
of the same thing. I do not imagine they will very soon 
attempt to ply it again. But in its stead another battery 
has been opened upon the judiciary, the operation of which 
only futurity can determine. Immediately after Mr. Chase 
was declared to be acquitted of all the charges brought 
against him by the House of Representatives, the same 
member * of that House who had originated and principally 
conducted impeachment offered to their consideration a 
proposed amendment to the Constitution, making the judges 
necessarily removable upon a joint address of the two 
branches of the legislature by simple majorities. Another 
of the managers, 2 the one next him in power, offered, also, a 
further amendment to make the members of the Senate 
liable at any time to be recalled by the respective legislatures. 
Both these propositions are made the order of the day of 
the House of Representatives for the first day of the next 
session. These motions were made just at the pungent

n8 THE WRITINGS OF [1805 

moment of disappointment, and were I think somewhat 
inconsiderately offered at the same time. I should expect 
that at the next session the second will be relinquished, but 
I also believe the other will be pursued with persevering 
ardor. As there is much to be said in its favor as a proper 
provision, independent of all application to present circum 
stances; as it is recommended, not only by the example of 
Great Britain, but by some of the best among our state con 
stitutions; and as it must be in every point of view a desirable 
alteration to the ruling majority, there is the strongest prob 
ability that it will not readily be abandoned. Its success in 
the Senate, however, will be very problematical, at least 
until another election shall have intervened. Several of the 
members of this body besides those who voted for the full 
acquittal of Mr. Chase were much dissatisfied at the measure 
which so directly pointed at their body, and their disgust 
at that extended some degree of disfavor to the other prop 
osition with which it was coupled. Both of them were 
felt to be intended to cast reflections upon the Senate itself, 
as well as upon its recent judgment and a sense of interest. 
The honor and dignity of the corps were discernible in the 
sentiments of many members who had gone the farthest 
towards the conviction of the judges. The Senate is not 
without enemies to its own constitution within its walls, and 
there are more yet of its members destitute of the fortitude 
to resist encroachments attempted by the leaders of the 
popular branch of the legislature. The cooperation of these 
men may possibly be obtained to seal the doom of the judicial 
department in the shape of an amendment to the Constitu 
tion, although they have not united to do it by the means 
of impeachment. 

After the decision in favor of Mr. Chase and the two 
propositions in the House of Representatives, which I have 



i8o 5 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 119 

noticed, and which all happened on the same day, there were 
only two days remaining to close the session; but in those 
two days two incidents occurred calculated to inspire an 
expectation, that upon the crisis which appears to be hasten 
ing upon us the Senate will ultimately prove true to its own 
honor and to the highest interests of our country. The 
judgment was given on the first of March. On the second, 
Mr. Burr, then Vice President, took leave of the Senate, and 
previous to quitting the chair delivered a valedictory address 
of about twenty minutes in length which appeared to make, 
and I believe has left, a profound impression upon the mind 
of every person who heard him. In this address among 
several other striking observations he expressed himself 
nearly in these words: 

And permit me to recommend to you in your future deliberations 
inflexibly to maintain and to cherish those habits of order and 
regularity which upon experience are found to be intimately con 
nected with important principles. On a superficial view only they 
appear of inconsiderable consequence, but on full investigation it 
will be discovered that there is scarce a departure from order but 
leads to, or is indissolubly connected with, a departure from 
morality. This body is growing in importance. It is here, if any 
where, that our country must ultimately find the anchor of her 
safety; here the stand is to be made at once against the storms of 
faction, the silent arts of corruption, and, if the Constitution is to 
perish, which may God avert, and which I do not believe, its dying 
agonies will be witnessed upon this floor. 

The allusion to the circumstances which had just taken 
place was obvious, and it appeared to me there was not a 
member present but felt the force of this solemn appeal to 
his sense of duty. 

On the same day a difference between the two Houses 
arose upon a bill making provision for payment of the wit- 



120 THE WRITINGS OF [1805 

nesses summoned to attend the Senate on the trial of Mr. 
Chase s impeachment. This bill had passed in the House of 
Representatives some days before, and made an appropria 
tion of five thousand dollars to pay the witnesses summoned 
on the part of the chairman of the prosecution, and to defray 
any other expenses which had been incurred on the trial, and 
which should be certified by the chairman of the managers. 
On the second reading of the bill in Senate, the day before 
the sentence passed, amendments were moved to double 
the amount of the appropriation, to provide for the payment 
of expenses incurred on the occasion by order of the Vice 
President, certified by him, and to extend the payment of the 
witnesses to all those who had been summoned and attended 
on the part of the respondent as well as the others. The 
question on these amendments was by general consent post 
poned until after the decision upon the trial, it being observed 
that its aspect would be materially different according as the 
issue should be for conviction or for acquittal. This event 
having taken place, the amendments were unanimously 
adopted in Senate, but on being sent to the House of Repre 
sentatives were disagreed to by them. Each house insisted 
in the usual form. A conference was had without producing 
any agreement; each house adhered to its own purpose and 
the bill was lost. Nor is it an inconsiderable fact that the 
last act of the Senate upon this bill, that of adhering, was 
without a dissenting voice. This question will probably 
be renewed at the next session of Congress, for by the failure 
of the Bill no provision is made for paying any of the wit 
nesses, and they certainly all have a just claim to some in 
demnity for their time and attendance given at the regular 
summons of the Senate. The question whether the United 
States shall pay the witnesses on both sides in cases of im 
peachment is in many points of view important as a general 



i8o 5 ] JOHN QU1NCY ADAMS 121 

question. It was not fully discussed in either house on this 
bill, and reason and precedent may be produced in support 
of both its sides. There were, however, in this instance cir 
cumstances peculiarly tending to influence the Senate in 
first adopting and finally adhering to the principle of indis 
criminate payment. The acquittal of the person accused 
was one. But there was another which might have yet 
greater weight. All the witnesses had been summoned by 
a subpoena, the form of which was reported by a Committee 
of which Mr. Giles was chairman. This form commanded 
the attendance of the witness, without any indication at the 
suggestion of which party it had issued. None of the wit 
nesses, therefore, could know whether they were summoned 
on behalf of the United States or of the respondent; their 
obedience was in all cases the same to the order of the Senate, 
and it seemed obvious that their claim for indemnity from 
the government stood on the same foundation. Mr. Giles 
very explicitly declared himself in favor of the principle 
and gave it as his unequivocal opinion that it should in 
point of justice and policy be extended to all cases of im 
peachment, whether the sentence should be for acquittal or 
for conviction. 

The fate of this bill was succeeded by an attempt in the 
House of Representatives to provide by their single act a 
substitute for it. A resolution was offered directing the 
payment of the witnesses summoned on their part from the 
contingent fund of the House, and this resolution prescribed 
the sum which should be allowed to each witness for his 
travel and attendance. It would inevitably have been car 
ried, but that the number of members then remaining, dis 
posed to rush into such extremes, was not sufficient of itself 
to form a quorum. And the members opposed to the meas 
ure, whenever it was called up, withdrew from the House. 



122 THE WRITINGS OF [1805 

Let it be remembered that this effort to extend the "unde 
fined field of contingencies" was made by those who have 
been most clamorous for the extremest detail of specific 
appropriation. 

It was in this situation, with the two houses of Congress 
in positions of direct opposition against each other, with the 
House of Representatives aiming with huge two handed 
sway, at the same moment a cut at the supreme judiciary 
and a thrust at the Senate; with the same House of Repre 
sentatives floating between anarchy and discord at one 
moment, unable to make a quorum, and at the next unable to 
keep it for the purpose of acting with a majority attempting 
with blushless face a flagrant violation of the Constitution, 
and a minority defeating their purpose by repeated secessions 
in a mass, with some important bills at the point of falling 
through, though passed by both branches, because the 
Speaker could not sign them without a quorum present in 
this situation it was, that at half past nine in the evening of 
Sunday the 3rd of March, the eighth Congress of the United 
States terminated its existence, and I have been induced 
by two motives to give you the detail contained in this and 
my last letter. The one, because the transactions which I 
have related may be the precursors of events more highly 
momentous, and as such deserve peculiarly to be noted down; 
and the other, because I was desirous to make you some re 
turn for the excellent letters I have received from you in the 
course of the winter, and which my engagements at the time 
compelled me to leave unanswered. I thought the narrative 
might afford you some amusement, and knew it would fur 
nish you a fund for useful reflections, of which I indulge the 
hope of sharing in the benefit. . . . 



i8o 5 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 123 

TO SAMUEL DEXTER 

QUINCY, 6 August, 1805. 
SIR: 

Being highly sensible of the honor done me by the govern 
ment of the University, in appointing me to the professor 
ship of rhetoric and oratory, founded by Mr. N. Boylston, 
and believing that the objects of that institution are of much 
importance to the reputation and honor of our country, I 
have felt a warm and anxious desire to justify as far as I am 
able the confidence thus reposed in me, and to undertake 
the discharge of functions, for which, however deficient in all 
other respects, I was conscious of a zealous and affectionate 
attachment. In considering attentively however the rules, 
directions and statutes under which this professorship is 
placed, I find them such as it would be worse than presump 
tion for me to pledge myself to, since I could not form the 
engagement without knowing my incompetency to perform 
its promise. 

The duties assigned to the professor would require his 
constant, unremitting attendance at the college, in term 
time, during the whole year. Avocations from which I do 
not feel myself authorized or inclined to seek a dispensation 
call me to a distant part of the country during half the year. 
These indeed may be temporary, and cease in the course of a 
few years, but in such case they will be followed by others 
which would render a constant residence or attendance at 
Cambridge through the year alike impracticable for me. 

It was suggested by some gentlemen of the committee, 
that perhaps such a modification of the statutes might be 

1 Chairman of the Committee of the Corporation and Overseers of Harvard Uni 
versity. 



i2 4 THE WRITINGS OF [1805 

adopted as would render my performance of the duties com 
patible with a residence in the neighborhood of Cambridge, 
and with occasional absence on necessary attendance to other 
employments; and as the committee appeared desirous that 
I should specify what part of the duties prescribed by the 
rules I could positively undertake, I have no hesitation in 
complying with their request. 

The course of public lectures to the two Senior classes 
and resident graduates is by the statutes to be given in 
weekly lectures. This of course contemplates a series of 
about forty lectures. The objects to which the attention of 
the lecturer is directed by the regulations could not, indeed, 
be properly treated in the compass of a smaller number. In 
stead of reading this course by one weekly lecture, I should 
readily engage to accomplish the same object by two lectures 
a week, during that part of the year when I could give my 
attendance. But as the first composition of the course must 
obviously be a work of much labor, and require a very at 
tentive perusal of numerous writers in various languages, 
some of which are not altogether familiar to me, I should 
expect to be allowed two years in the first instance for the 
completion of the course. Thus in the course of the next 
summer, I should hold myself engaged to go through half 
the course with the hope of finishing the remainder the 
succeeding year, after which I should be content to go 
through the whole course every year by two lectures in the 
week in the summer terms. 

The next object in the regulations which appears more 
peculiarly to belong to this branch of instruction is that 
which relates to the elocution of the students. And if the 
other arrangements of the college exercises could be so 
adapted, that the public declamations of the two Senior 
classes should be fixed on the same days when I should 



i8o 5 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 125 

attend to give the public lectures, I would readily devote the 
day to the purpose of presiding at them. I should also give 
the necessary attendance to hear in private the performances 
previous to the annual commencement, and when practic 
able, previous to the exhibitions. Further than this will 
certainly not be in my power, and even to the performance 
of this, I am deeply conscious of needing a full share of the 
customary indulgence experienced by other instructors. 

There is another part of the statutes which I feel myself 
under an indispensable obligation to request may be revised. 
It is that part of the third article which imposes upon the 
professor a religious test, to be applied publicly on the day of 
his inauguration. The Constitution of the Commonwealth 
has made a general declaration of belief in the Christian 
religion sufficient for admission to the highest offices of the 
State, and in the opinion of many wise, virtuous and pious 
citizens even that requisition is too much. With the most 
perfect deference and respect for the legislature of the college, 
I must question their authority to require my subscription to 
a creed not recognized by the Constitution or laws of the 
State; nor do I perceive in a professorship of rhetoric and 
oratory anything which peculiarly calls for so minute a 
scrutiny into the details of the professor s religious opinions 
as is here proposed. I beg to be understood that this objec 
tion has reference more to the interest of the institution it 
self, than personally to me. It is to the test itself, and not 
to the doctrines which it prescribes. These I wish to leave 
undisturbed by any controversy; reserving my confession of 
faith for my Maker, and desirous of seeing my fellow crea 
tures enjoy the same indulgence. 

I cannot conclude without expressing my wish, sir, that 
in their deliberations upon this occasion, the Corporation 
and Overseers would altogether discard every consideration 



126 THE WRITINGS OF [1805 

of personal accommodation to me; that the interests and the 
feelings of the man may be altogether excluded, and the in 
terests of the University alone consulted; assuring you and 
them that if, in their opinion, the welfare of the students will 
be promoted by the election of a person so situated as to 
have the performance of all the duties assigned by the stat 
utes in his power, I shall most cheerfully acquiesce in the 
decision. In that case, they will consider this letter as declin 
ing the acceptance of the office, with the offer of which they 
have honored me, and proceed when they shall think proper 
to the choice of another person. 
I am, &c, 

TO THE CORPORATION OF HARVARD COLLEGE 

QUINCY, ii October, 1805. 
GENTLEMEN: 

A vote of the Corporation, dated 2 September, has been 
communicated to me by the Honorable Judge Davis, which 
vote having passed on consideration of my letter to the 
chairman of the committee of the Corporation and Overseers 
of 7 [6] August last, I am requested to state in writing my 
observations upon it. 

The declaration proposed to be substituted instead of that 
originally required by the third article of the rules and regula 
tions, is such as I can have no objection to making. 

But the proviso "that suitable provision be made for the 
performance by some competent substitute of the duties 
which may not be required to be performed by the professor 
of rhetoric and oratory, personally; said substitute to be ap 
pointed by the Corporation and Overseers, and his title, 
powers and duties to be by them designated," is liable to some 
difficulties. 



i8o S ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 127 

In its most obvious construction it proposes a deputy 
totally independent of and beyond the control of his prin 
cipal. And if this was not the real intention of the vote its 
inevitable operation must be such; since upon points of in 
struction, relative to an object so dependent upon taste as 
elocution, the exercise of any control over the principles or 
practice of an instructor would in my mind be inconsistent 
with the delicacy of deportment due from one gentleman to 
another, even if the power of such control were absolutely 
given. 

It would, therefore, be substantially a separate and dis 
tinct establishment, yet so connected with the professorship 
as might lead to unpleasant differences between the two 
teachers, and become a source of embarrassment and per 
plexity, if not of contempt, to the students. 

I would respectfully submit also to the consideration of 
the Corporation, how far the establishment of a substitute 
would be consistent with the manifest intention of the Boyl- 
ston foundation itself. By that foundation the subject of 
rhetoric and oratory is supposed to be properly within the 
department of one person; and although it could not be the 
wish of the founder to tie the hands of the college govern 
ment from the establishment of any other similar institution, 
yet is it imaginable that he would have devoted a part of his 
estate to this object, had he foreseen that it would be divided 
into a double foundation, or provided for by other means? 
If a part of the professor s defined duties may be substituted 
off upon a vicar, why may not the whole be disposed of in 
the same manner? If the principle of substitution may be 
grafted upon a branch of the professorship, what should 
hinder its being made in future to cover the whole stock? 
A progress of things in such a course as this is not with 
out example; but its ultimate issue has ever been a total 



128 THE WRITINGS OF [1805 

perversion of the appropriation from its intended desti 
nation. 

In one particular these remarks have a bearing upon my 
personal concern, which will I hope serve as my justification 
for making them. In undertaking the duties of this office I 
should consider myself bound by all the means in my com 
petency to fulfil the intentions of the founder. But such is 
the minuteness of the rules and regulations prescribed, that 
nothing is left to the discretion or to the judgment of the 
professor. Perhaps the modes of instruction pointed out in 
these rules may be the best that could be devised. The sub 
ject being entirely new to me I certainly have nothing to 
propose which might be better adapted to the purpose. 
Something may possibly be suggested by experience, and by 
the reflections which a course of time devoted to the institu 
tion may occasion. In such a contingency I should rely upon 
a disposition on the part of the college government to weigh 
with candor and indulgence any proposals for variations in 
the exercises, to facilitate the instruction of the students in 
this part of their education. But if any such measures should 
require consideration, shackled with the existence of another 
officer charged with a part of the professor s duties, I appre 
hend the chances of improvement in the system would be 
very much impaired. 

I very sincerely lament the trouble which you gentlemen 
have had on this occasion, and as it may possibly prevent 
further embarrassments of the same kind, if I give you ex 
plicitly my ideas upon the subject, I will observe that the 
original rules and regulations formed a system of instruction 
on this foundation which it would be impossible for me to 
carry into effect. I was requested to state in writing what 
part of that system I could engage to accomplish, and in 
consequence wrote my former letter to the chairman of your 



itesl JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 129 

committee. But it was never my wish or idea to obtain a 
personal accommodation to myself by a permission to have 
a substitute assigned me to perform part of my duties. The 
duties of the office if I hold it must be discharged by myself. 
Were they such as to leave me any exercise of my own judg 
ment in respect to the modes of instruction I should be happy 
to undertake them. Were they all prescribed to me, but of 
a nature to require only the portion of time which I can apply 
to this occupation, I should cheerfully assume them; being 
as they are, requiring a daily and unintermitted attendance 
in term time the whole year round, I would still from my 
zeal for the interests of the University, and particularly for 
the objects of foundation, engage to perform them, were I 
not certain it would be pledging myself to what I cannot 
accomplish. A modification of the duties themselves, not 
of the manner in which they are to be executed, is what I 
have to request, if it be deemed perfectly consistent with the 
views of the founder, and with the honor of the college and 
its government. 
I am, &c. 

TO JOHN ADAMS 

WASHINGTON, 6 December, 1805. 
DEAR SIR: 

I inclosed under a blank cover to you a copy of the Presi 
dent s message on the day when it was delivered, and having 
now to inclose a letter from my wife to my mother, and a 
bill which has already passed both Houses of Congress, I 
cannot forbear writing a line with it to recall myself to your 
kind remembrance. 

You will perceive tnat the message is in a style and tone 
which have not been fashionable of late years. It is probable 



130 THE WRITINGS OF [1805 

the representatives of the people will not readily pledge 
themselves to the responsibility of all measures of energy 
which it recommends. The dispositions of the representa 
tives towards each other, as far as can yet be observed, is less 
acrimonious than for some years past. But no occasion has 
yet occurred to call forth manifestations of temper. 

The inclosed bill covers only a part of the deficiency in the 
naval appropriation for the current year. Its whole amount 
is of 600,000 dollars. The bill passed the House of Repre 
sentatives on a bare statement that the deficiency existed 
and without a question asked. In Senate on a motion of 
Mr. Tracy the Secretary of the Navy was called on for the 
reasons of this deficiency, and he has made a report which 
you will see when printed. To meet some of the expenses 
which have so far outrun the prior provisions and which 
pressed for payment before Congress met, the system 
of specific appropriation has been freely trampled under 
feet. 

I this day occasionally met and instantly recognized our 
old friend Captain Landais, whom I had not seen for upwards 
of twenty years. But I had some difficulty to brush up his 
remembrance of me. When brought fully to his recollection 
he was very particular in his inquiries after you, whom he 
tells me he saw not many years since. 1 

1 December 8, "Captain Landais, an old acquaintance whom I had not seen for 
upwards of twenty years, called upon me this morning, and sat with me a couple of 
hours, which prevented me from going out. I had recognized him two days since 
walking in one of the entrance rooms at the Capitol, and accosted him by name. 
He did not then immediately know me; but on my explaining to him who I was, 
remembered me. My acquaintance with him was in the spring and summer of the 
year 1779, at Brest, Nantes and 1 Orient, on board the frigate Alliance which he 
then commanded, and on board of which I was to have returned with my father to 
this country. But the destination of the Alliance was changed, and we came home 
in the French frigate la Sensible. Captain Landais this morning gave me a history 
of his life since that time, which has been various and full of adventure. He is now

TO RICHARD RUSH 

WASHINGTON, 12 December, 1805. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

I have just received your favor of the 8th instant, and 
can only assure you that I have no reason to suppose there is 
the smallest foundation for the report to which you allude, 
but on the contrary that I have good reason for believing it 
altogether groundless. That any such mission is contem 
plated by the government appears to me not very probable, 
but if it is, the person selected for it will be different. 

Your desire of visiting Europe is very natural, and is dic 
tated by views so honorable that I hope you will find some 
real occasion by which it may be gratified. 

I shall according to your request consider your letter as 
altogether confidential, and beg leave to be persuaded that 
in anything within my power I shall ever be happy to prove 
to you the sincerity of the esteem and friendship with which 
I am, &C. 1

at the political plough. The season here has been in all re 
spects uncommonly mild until within these few days, and 
the world of parties and legislation as moderate as the tem 
perature of the atmosphere. But as the new year advances 
the weather grows cold, and we grow warm. We are very 
much perplexed what we shall do to manifest our valor with 
out hazarding our persons, and after spending a long session 
in discussing the subject, we shall in all probability finish 
without doing anything of importance. At least I have al 
ready seen enough to convince me that we shall do nothing 
good. For the protection of our territory or of our commerce 
we shall do nothing; but we may very possibly prepare for 
the abandonment of the first, and contribute our share to 
the sacrifices of the last. We shall perhaps enter into the 
unprofitable contest with Great Britain which can do the 
most harm, not to the other, but to ourselves. In this emu 
lation of mischief I am far from being certain but that we 
shall bear the palm. 

Reports are in circulation that all our differences with 
Spain are already settled entirely to our advantage, but if not 
we shall try again to trade with her for land. We shall per 
haps offer her almost all our province of Louisiana for the 
Floridas, or, if she likes it better, more money; fighting her 
we have almost done even talking of. 

Captain Landais particularly desires me to present his 
respects to you. I have sent you the report of the Secretary 
of State on his petition or memorial. The papers are cu 
rious, and Count Bernstorff s letter in answer to the applica 
tion of Dr. Franklin is amusing, as it shows the old gentle 
man s embarrassment between the alternate pressure of 
England on one side, and France on the other. He appears 
to have understood that his most effectual means of ex 
tricating himself was to drown his outrage against the 



i8o6] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 133 

United States in a flood of personal adulation to their 
minister. 1 

Our Tunisian and Indian visitors are still the principal 
objects of curiosity we have to entertain us. Many of the 
Indians who were here are gone, but others have come to take 
their places without any invitation, and they are so numer 
ous as to occasion some uneasiness among the inhabitants 
of this neighborhood. They are sometimes troublesome by 
introducing themselves unexpectedly to private houses, and 
their habits of intemperance sometimes make them uncom 
fortable companions. 

Mr. Giles and Mr. Bayard have not yet taken their seats 
this session. I suppose they will arrive nearly together. 
Their absence leaves both sides of the House in a manner 
without leaders, and a great degree of unsteadiness and lan 
guor hangs over our proceedings in consequence of this cir 
cumstance. We find great reason to regret the loss of our 
late President. 2

ment on the pretext of their being engaged in a trade with the 
Enemies of Great Britain not permitted before the war is an unpro 
voked aggression upon the property of the citizens of these United 
States a wanton violation of their neutral rights and a direct en 
croachment upon their national Independence. 

Resolved, That the President of the United States be requested 
to instruct the Minister of the United States at the Court of Great 
Britain to demand and insist upon the immediate restoration of 
the property of the Citizens of the United States which has been 
or may be captured and condemned on the said pretext and upon 
their indemnification for their losses and damages sustained by 
such arbitrary seizures and unjust condemnations. 

Resolved, That it is expedient by Law to suspend the power of 
transfer upon all Certificates in the funds or Bank Stock of the 
United States held by subjects of the king of Great Britain until 
the British Government shall have given satisfaction to the United 
States on the subject of the said captures and condemnations and 
no longer. And that the Committee be directed to bring in a bill 
for that purpose. 

TO JOHN ADAMS 

WASHINGTON, n February, 1806. 

Since the date of your favor of the 29th ultimo you have 
doubtless received many additional documents, confirming 
your opinion of the system of policy prevalent here in rela 
tion to our foreign affairs. Unqualified submission to France 
and unqualified defiance of Great Britain are indeed the two 
pillars upon which our measures are to rest, and numerous 
as the proofs are which you will have of these facts, you have 
probably still no conception of the extremes to which it has 
already been carried. The prohibition of the trade to St. 

being stricken out by a vote of sixteen to fifteen; and the third, "belonging to Gen 
eral Smith and Mr. Anderson" was not adopted. See Adams, Memoirs. 



1806] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 135 

Domingo is now upon its last stage in Senate, and in all 
probability before I close this letter will be passed. 1 But 
this is nothing, comparatively speaking. The general tend 
ency of opinions and passions which govern our adminis 
tration has always been such that this course might have 
been expected from the commencement of our session; but 
all the events which have recently occurred in Europe, and 
the knowledge of which has come to us since our meeting, 
have very powerfully contributed to confirm this course of 
measures. Our people have indeed an enthusiastic opinion 
of the power of France, and if there could before have re 
mained any doubt of the foundation upon which that opinion 
stands, what can be replied to the proofs of Bonaparte s 
armies in Vienna, and the whole Austrian Empire sinking 
before them almost without a struggle of resistance. The 
continent of Europe, it cannot be questioned, is not only 
prostrate at the feet of France, but to all appearance irre 
trievably subdued. How long the insular situation of Great 
Britain and her naval force will enable her to bear up against 
this universal suppression, is not easy to say; but that she 
too must sink sooner or later under such a mass and impetus 
of force can hardly be questioned. 

I know not to what extent France will avail herself of the, 
situation in which she stands to dictate humiliation or sub 
mission to us; but this I have no reason to doubt, that what 
soever she shall please to command we shall comply with. 

There is only one doubt yet remaining upon my mind as 
to the ruling principle of our foreign policy, and that is, 
whether in the terrors we are assuming against Great Britain 
there is not as much or more of vapor than of substance. 
There are some indications which might lead to the conclu-

sion, that when we come to the critical moment we shall not 
be so terrible as we now threaten. The tables of both Houses 
are loaded with motion upon motion for non-intercourse, for 
non-importation, for navigation acts, for retaliation and re 
prisal, for confiscation of debts, and for everything that can 
exhibit temper against the British; but to all this there is 
besides the opposition which it will meet from reasonable 
quarters, a vast body of opposition lurking among the friends 
of the administration itself. All the quakerish members of 
both Houses are averse to anything that looks even by a 
squint towards energy. Being for peace all the world over, 
they begin to discover that these measures may give offence 
to Great Britain, and they think the only course to be pur 
sued is negotiation. Besides this the members for the 
Southern states discover reluctance to agree upon anything 
which may obstruct the freedom of their trade in foreign 
ships, or affect the exportation of their cotton. It is obvious 
that great efforts are making to stimulate the passions of the 
people, and to lash into fermentation the blood of their 
representatives; but it is not yet equally clear that this plan 
will be so far successful as to show itself in the form of law. 

By one of the documents inclosed you will perceive that 
Mr. J. Randolph has renewed his motion for an amendment 
to the Constitution making the judges removable upon the 
address of the two Houses. It is probable that this will pass 
by a competent proportion of votes in the House of Repre 
sentatives. What will be its fate in Senate I am unable to 
foresee. 1 

The Supreme Court of the United States is now in session. 
All the judges are here excepting Mr. Chase, who is very ill at 
Baltimore. Judge Gushing is also unwell, and has hitherto

not been able to take his seat. The Court di-d not sit until 
Saturday, a competent number of the judges not having 
arrived until then. I am so confined by my attendance in 
Senate and upon the business transacting in Senate that I 
shall not be able to attend the Court as I should wish. 

The pressure of business has also forcibly driven my clas 
sical studies from my head. I do indeed still appropriate 
about an hour a day to that object, but it is little better 
than a lost hour; the studies of a scholar require a mind at 
ease, a vacant mind, or at least a mind not engrossed by 
other objects. But when the questions of public import 
and measures of national deliberation take hold of my mind, 
and have warmly engaged me nine or ten hours in the day, I 
lose entirely the power of abstraction and the means of 
studying the poetry, history, or languages of antiquity. A 
similar cause will I hope excuse any incoherence which you 
may frequently perceive in my letters to you and my other 
friends from this place. I am obliged to write in the midst of 
debates to which I cannot avoid giving more or less of atten 
tion at the very time I am writing. At this moment, for in 
stance, Dr. Mitchill is giving us a dissertation upon salt 
petre, and telling us of all the rocks, dens, caves, fens and 
mountain sides, where it is to be found in the United States, 
on a bill to prohibit the exportation of arms and ammunition. 
The St. Domingo trade bill has been re-committed to a select 
committee for amendment.

i 3 8 THE WRITINGS OF [1806 

TO WILLIAM STEPHENS SMITH 

WASHINGTON, 26 March, 1806. 
DEAR SIR: 

I received last evening your favor of the 23rd. The ap 
pointment of Mr. Schenck had been two or three days before 
confirmed by the Senate. I most sincerely lament your re 
moval from the office of Surveyor, but this act is exclusively 
within the power of the President, and the only notice he 
usually gives to the Senate of a removal is by a new nomina 
tion to the office. Such was the case in the present instance. 
The first intimation I had of your being suspended was the 
nomination of the new officer. Neither have the Senate, or I 
believe any of your friends in this body, any influence which 
could affect a nomination in favor of your brother, or in op 
position to that which was made. 

With respect to your connection with General Miranda, or 
the knowledge which the President or Secretary of State had 
of his projects, I know nothing but what is to be collected 
from the newspapers; never having had any communication 
from you, from Miranda, or from the Executive on this sub 
ject. 1 If you were induced to believe that it was the Presi 
dent s intention to countenance any purpose of hostility to 

ous and delicate subject; but something seems necessary to be done, to prevent too 
much petulance and impertinence." John Adams to John Quincy Adams, Febru 
ary 26, 1806. Ms. 

"Your disapprobation of the bill concerning foreign ministers, which I intro 
duced, reconciled me to its fate more than the decision upon it, which had taken 
place before I knew your opinion. I still think, however, that we shall find some 
legislative provision necessary upon the subject, and still doubt the President s con 
stitutional powers, without a law, to check something worse than insolence in a for 
eign minister, if it should happen." To John Adams, March 28, 1806. Ms.

ation Report, 1907, I. 189.

Spain, I very much regret both the fact and its consequences. 
That he had no such intention is obvious from the course of 
policy which has prevailed, and has always appeared evident 
to me, from the time when I had last the pleasure of seeing 
you at New York. Of the grounds you may have had for a 
different inference I am unable to judge, not knowing what 
they were. 
I am, &c. L 

TO WILLIAM STEPHENS SMITH 

WASHINGTON, 16 April, 1806. 
DEAR SIR: 

I have within these few days successively received your 
two letters, one of them containing the relation of the cir 
cumstances respecting General Miranda s projects, and your 
relations with him while he was in this country, and the other 
containing the request that I would write an oration for your 
son John. On the first of these subjects I trust that in the 
trial of the cause on the bill found by the Grand Jury, of 
which I have seen an account in the New York prints, you 
will have competent proof to produce that you have not 
violated the laws of the United States. As to the conduct of 
the President and Secretary of State, whether they said too 
much to Miranda, or whether he inferred from what they 
said or did more than he was warranted to infer, I am at 
present very incompetent to determine. That he misunder 
stood or misrepresented their real intentions I have no doubt. 
Where the mistake originated must remain for the present a 
matter of opinion. 

1 On April I, Adams spoke against a bill for the relief of Hamet Caramelli, ex- 
Bashaw of Tripoli. His speech is printed in Annals of Congress, 9th Cong., ist 
Sess., 211. 



140 THE WRITINGS OF [1806 

My own occupations so fully engross my time that I fear 
it will not be in my power to write the oration, and I have so 
much confidence in the genius and acquirements of your son, 
that I believe him able to honor himself more by writing his 
own performance at his Commencement, than by depending 
upon a friend for the production. I have an high opinion of 
his good sense, discretion and application, and am persuaded 
he will acquit himself very creditably without any assistance 
from abroad. 

Congress are to adjourn next Monday the 2ist. They 
break up under a variety of unpleasant and unpromising 
circumstances. I propose to leave this place about the 
25th, and hope to have the pleasure of seeing you before the 
last of the month. My wife remains here for the present, and 
probably will remain here through the summer. 

I am, &c. 

TO SAMUEL BARRON * 

WASHINGTON, 18 April, 1806. 
SIR: 

As it is probable that the transactions relative to the close 
of the war, and the negotiations for the peace with Tripoli, 
will again become a subject of deliberation at the next session 
of Congress, and as it may perhaps not be in my power to 
obtain then the information which is only in your possession, 
and which I think important to elucidate the subject, I take 
the liberty to request your answer to the following questions, 
and also for any other information relative to the same ob 
ject which you may think proper to communicate. 

I. What was your particular object and intention in sending 
Mr. Eaton into Egypt after Hamet Bashaw? 

1 Henry Adams, History, II. 431. 



i8o6] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 141 

2. Was this object and intention understood by Mr. Eaton at 
that time? 

3. What was the amount of the supplies furnished by you to 
Hamet Bashaw, besides those for which Mr. Eaton was account 
able? 

4. What were the circumstances which induced you to recom 
mend to Mr. Lear the negotiation of peace with the reigning 
Bashaw? 

5. Did you conceive yourself authorized to furnish men from 
the squadron to lead a coup de main against Tripoli? 

6. Do you know what number of men Hamet Bashaw and Mr. 
Eaton had with them, at and after the taking of Derne? 

7. What is the distance from Derne to Tripoli by land, and 
what is your opinion of the practicability of Harriet s marching to 
Tripoli with the force he had, or could command? 

8. What was the information of Hamet Bashaw s want of means 
and resources, which finally induced you to abandon the plan of 
cooperation with him? 

9. What was his situation in Egypt when found there by Mr. 
Eaton? 

And if you have no objection I shall also thank you for a 
certified copy of that letter from Mr. Blake, which you showed 
me, wherein the conversation between Mr. Eaton and 
Hamet Bashaw was related. 

If you can further refer me to any other person possessed 
of information, which may be of use to exhibit the real state 
of these affairs, I shall esteem it a further obligation and re 
main, &C. 1

142 THE WRITINGS OF [1806 

TO LOUISA CATHERINE ADAMS 

May i, 1806. 

... I am lodged at the City Hotel. Yesterday I dined 
with Mr. King and spent the last evening at Colo. Trum- 
bull s. The city of New York is in the greatest bustle I 
ever witnessed. This is the universal moving day, and about 
half the inhabitants are changing their places of abode. They 
are also in the midst of a warmly contested election for mem 
bers of Congress and of their state legislature. The federal 
ists, for the first time these two or three years, have run no 
candidates of their own, and though they do not much expect 
to carry the election, there is no doubt but they will come 
very near succeeding. Besides all this there has been great 
agitation in the city from the unfortunate occurrence on 
Saturday last. The British ships Leander and Cambrian are 
lying off the port, and a shot from the first of them killed a 
man on board a coasting vessel coming from the Delaware. 
All communication with the ships has been since cut off, and 
two or three of their officers are on shore, and cannot get on 
board. The grand jury of the city and county have found a 
bill of indictment against the captain of the Leander for mur 
der, and a representation of the facts has been sent on to the 
President at Washington, where no doubt you will hear 
much of this event. . . . 

May 10, 1806. 

. . . On Tuesday I went with my father to Cambridge to 
attend the inauguration of the new President of the college, 
Mr. [Samuel] Webber. The ceremonies of the day were 
sufficiently dull. The performances mostly in Latin, with a 
comfortable proportion of English in the idiom to make it 
intelligible. There was, however, a young gentleman [Sam- 



i8o6] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 143 

uel Gary], just out of college, who knew more about making 
Latin, as they call it at school, than the rest, and pronounced 
a sort of complimentary oration, which would have pleased 
me very well, but for a little prophetical sally, in which he 
told them what wonders of eloquence they were to perform 
when the new professor should come. My turn will be next, 
and as there is no installation without a speech, I have asked 
the privilege of pronouncing it in a language which I can 
write, and the hearers can understand. I expect to be in 
dulged, though some of the adherents to the old school are 
very tenacious of the immemorial usage and abhorrent of 
innovation. ... At Mr. Amory s I met Sir Isaac Coffin, 
a British admiral, who has just arrived from England. . . . 
He tells me that Mr. Merry is recalled, and a Lord Selkirk ap 
pointed in his stead. This Lord Selkirk is said to be a great 
philosopher; and perhaps may be of great use to you know 
whom, in helping to make a moon. . . . 

June i, 1806. 

... It has been a week full of noise and bustle, being 
what we call election week, the character of which you will 
remember. The legislature met on Wednesday. The num 
ber of members in the House of Representatives is upwards, 
of four hundred and sixty, and nearly double the number 
which has heretofore been usual. The democrats have a 
majority of about fifty members, and Mr. Morton was of 
course chosen Speaker. In the Senate the numbers are more 
equally divided. There were thirty-nine members chosen, 
of whom nineteen are federalists and twenty democrats. 
They have found it impossible as yet to choose a President, 
the votes being divided between Mr. Otis and Mr. [John] 
Bacon, a man once known at Washington. They have, how 
ever, made him preside as the oldest member, and have filled 



i 4 4 THE WRITINGS OF [1806 

up the vacancy of a member, which will give them a decided 
majority. We are still uncertain who will be the governor. 
There is a majority of some hundred votes in favor of Mr. 
Strong; but the two houses are the judges of the returns, and 
have the power to throw out all the votes not regularly re 
turned. It is supposed that a sufficient number of the federal 
votes will be rejected to take off the majority, and then the 
choice will be made by the legislature. In that case there is 
no doubt but Mr. Sullivan will be chosen. . . - 1 

June 8, 1806. 

. . . Mr. Sullivan will undoubtedly be governor. Mr. 
Strong had indeed a full majority of all the votes returned; 
but as the Senate and House of Representatives decide upon 
the validity of the returns, and as there is a majority in both 
houses opposed to the governor, they have appointed a com 
mittee who reported to reject as not legally returned just votes 
enough to take the complete majority from Strong. Then 
the election is to be made by the legislature, and of course 
Mr. Sullivan will be chosen. The Senate have already ac 
cepted the report of the committee, and it goes to the House 
of Representatives for discussion tomorrow. The issue is 
foreseen, but it has already taken up almost as much time 
as our legislature generally sit at this season of the year. . . . 

QUINCY, 15 June, 1806. 

On Thursday afternoon at 5 o clock, the installation took 
place. The time fixed for the purpose was half past three; 
but a heavy thunder gust came up exactly at that time and 
delayed the performances nearly two hours. It also pre-

vented the attendance of many persons, and the company 
was very small. The heat was excessive, and I suffered much

the same evening to Boston. This week I expect to go to 
Cambridge and to reside there three or four months. I am

The great political question who should be governor is at 
length settled, and Mr. Strong is in for one year more. We 
had a clear majority of all the votes returned, but an at 
tempt was made and pushed with an unusual violence of 
party spirit to reject a number of votes sufficient to prevent 
him from having a majority of the whole number. A com 
mittee of the two houses of the legislature, five demos against 
two federalists, did accomplish the object as far as depended 
on them. They contrived to reject just votes enough to 
leave the governor short of the complete majority by four 
teen; and it is amusing to observe the expedients to which

"This address was in the highest degree elegant, classical, and energetic; abound

In so wide a field, it is obvious that the speaker was in danger of being oppressed 
with the multiplicity of his topics, and that the principal difficulty, which he had to 
encounter, was that of making a judicious selection. This embarrassment was 
completely surmounted, and the audience was delighted with a free, strong and 
perspicuous outline of the nature, history and practice of this preeminent art, 
sketched by the hand of a master. We congratulate Alma Mater on the acquisition 
of such an instructor." Columbian Centinel, June 18, 1806.

they resorted for that purpose. The Senate after long and 
warm debates accepted the report of the committee in all its 
parts, but the members of the minority entered a protest 
against the decision, which has appeared in all our news 
papers and shows the grounds of controversy. 1 When the 
report however pass d down to the House of Representa 
tives, many of the party began to stagger. The general 
sentiment abroad was much against them, and their own 
partisans were ashamed to support what they were doing. 
All of a sudden they bethought themselves to reject the votes 
of two towns more, by which means the majority was re 
stored to Mr. Strong: they immediately declared him to be 
chosen. And when I left Boston on Thursday to go up to 
Cambridge all the bells were ringing for joy that he was hav 
ing the oaths of office administered to him. He is, however, 
the only federalist left in the government. The legislature 
have changed all the officers annually elected by them, and 
the governor s council is completely altered. 

We are in expectation of a total eclipse of the sun to 
morrow morning. This is a very rare occurrence and has 
never been known to happen in Boston since the settlement 
of the country. There is, indeed, some little question whether 
it will be total here even now, as there are two calculations, 
one of which makes it less than total by about a minute and 
a half. At Washington you will see it very large, but the 
sun will not be wholly eclipsed by nearly one-twelfth. The 
little society which you remember I once belonged to in 
Boston have made some preparations for observing it with 
some attention, and are provided with glasses for the pur 
pose. I have agreed to meet with them in Mr. Bussey s 
garden, which he has offered them to take their observations.

CAMBRIDGE, 22 June, 1806. 

I just mentioned to you in a line which I wrote you on 
Wednesday that I had with a company of philosophers ob 
served the eclipse in Mr. Bussey s garden. It was indeed a 
very remarkable sight. The principal part of it you must 
have witnessed at Washington, but many of the most curious 
phenomena were those which arose from the total obscuration 
of the sun. His face was entirely covered at Boston about 
four minutes and a half. The darkness was such that it 
would have been impossible to read a small print, and I was 
obliged to use a lanthorn to observe the state of my ther 
mometer. The fowls roosted. The lowing herd wound 
slowly o er the lea. The western horizon with a sky per 
fectly serene looked as if it had been charged with one of the 
heaviest thunder clouds. The moon appeared like a patch 
of court plaister upon the face of Heaven, and all round the 
edges of her disk was a luminous border like that which you 
sometimes see round the edges of a dark cloud. Just before 
the sun came out the edge of the moon on the side from which 
he was to proceed assumed a deep crimson color, but never 
since my existence have I seen anything like the brightness 
of the first beam which he shot forth upon his return. The 
naked eye could not bear it for an instant, though for several 
minutes before his face was entirely closed in he suffered us 
to look at him. I know not the philosophical reason why the 
first rays of reviving splendor should be so much more daz 
zling than the last beams of expiring glory, but such was the 
fact. From the commencement of the eclipse to the time of 
the total obscurity the thermometer fell eleven degrees, and 
by the time the moon fully disappeared it had risen again 
about as much, being all the time in the shade. 1

148 THE WRITINGS OF [1806 

I have seen in the newspaper account of the death of Mr. 
George Wythe, a Judge of the Court of Chancery in Virginia, 
and a man much distinguished during an important period 
of the American Revolution. He was at one time an inti 
mate friend of my father, who once address d to him a letter 
on the subject of government which has often been pub 
lished. Of late years he, like so many other persons of the 
revolutionary times, had forgotten ancient friendships and 
had fallen into another political scale; yet he had not lost 
his place in my father s regard, and I am sure he has been 
much affected at the incident, particularly, as by a para 
graph in the Richmond Enquirer, it appears there were sus 
picions that Mr. Wythe s death was not in the ordinary 
course of nature. On whom the suspicions have fallen the 
papers do not say, but probably as it is in your neighborhood, 
and as he was a man of so distinguished a character, you 
may have heard. If you have, let me know how the circum 
stances are told. 1 



TO THE CORPORATION OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY 

CAMBRIDGE, 26 June, 1806. 
GENTLEMEN: 

By the sixth article of the rules and regulations for the 
Boylston professorship of rhetoric and oratory, it is directed 
that the professor shall read a course of public lectures at 
least once a week to the resident graduates and two senior 
classes of undergraduates on the subject of his profession. 
The general object of which is, that it shall contain a system 
of rhetoric conformable to the models of the ancients. 

To comply with the main purpose of this article I was pre-

i8o6] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 149 

pared to deliver the first lecture of this course, and the day 
was fixed for it (this day), when an idea occurred to me which 
has induced me to postpone it, until I can request of you and 
of the Overseers, if you deem an act of that body necessary 
that the class now Sophomores, but to commence Juniors at 
the next commencement, may be permitted to attend my 
course of lectures from the beginning. My reason for this is, 
that as this class will of right attend the course after com 
mencement, it will probably be of material use to them (so 
far as the whole course may be of use,) to hear the first 
five or six lectures. Otherwise they will be required to attend 
the lectures during the two years they will remain at college, 
and yet after all have only a fragment of the whole, not hav 
ing been permitted to attend the first five or six. 

I have also to remark that the minuteness of detail into 
which this same article enters to prescribe the particulars of 
this course appears to me altogether unnecessary, and if to 
be adhered to according to the letter, would impose upon me 
shackles to which I am not inclined to submit. The divisions 
and subdivisions of the science and the proper means for 
pursuing its study might, I suppose, in general be left to the 
judgment of the professor. Indeed I always so understood 
that it was intended by the Corporation and Overseers. If I 
have been mistaken, I must request the article may be modi 
fied, that the general object of the course remaining the same, 
both the form and the substance of the lectures may be left 
to the professor s discretion. I am, &c. 

P. S. I must request a decision as soon as can be conven 
ient upon the subject of this letter, as I shall immediately 
after receiving it commence the course. 



1 5 o THE WRITINGS OF [1806 

TO LOUISA CATHERINE ADAMS 

QUINCY, 29 June, 1806. 

I have spent the week at Cambridge in a state of great 
tranquillity and without the occurrence of any incident worth 
mentioning to you, except the commencement of my new 
duties. I found it irksome enough, and myself very awkward 
in the business; yet I believe it a situation in which I can 
be of much more service to my country than in that where 
your fond partiality supposes me to be of some use. I have 
at present, however, no intention to resign. The term of my 
public service will soon be at an end, and in the present con 
dition of politics in this state, as well as almost all the rest, 
there is no danger that when my time expires I shall have 
the opportunity to continue in public life. It is, therefore, 
proper to seek by any anticipation the motives of comfort 
against the mortification of being displaced, a sort of censure 
the commonness of which, as well as the respectability of 
character of those who have suffered it, has purified from all 
disgrace, but which when it comes I suppose every one must 
in some measure feel. We are verging to a state of things 
not very consistent with the principles of republican govern 
ment, but through which all republics must pass; a state of 
things, in which merit of any kind whatsoever will be no 
consideration at all, or at best but a very subordinate con 
sideration, and when the only essential qualification for office 
will be party. We have, indeed, advanced very far in this 
course, and are taking strides towards its utmost bounds 
every day. The legislature of this state, since the change in 
their political character, have displaced without exception 
every man in office whom they could remove, and who was 



i8o6] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 151 

suspected of federalism. This is the first instance in which 
anything of that kind has been done in this state, though 
it is only an imitation of what has been done by the govern 
ment of the United States, and by all the other states which 
have undergone the same change. When the tide shall turn 
again, which sooner or later it certainly will, this example 
will inevitably be followed, not improbably with some addi 
tional aggravations; because in addition to the same motive 
for getting the places which has occasioned the revolution 
in the first instance, there will be much individual resentment 
to gratify, and much rancor of revenge to indulge. . . . 

My present situation continues as agreeable as when I 
wrote you last. Mrs. Waterhouse is an agreeable and pleas 
ant tempered woman, and the Doctor a man of learning, 
ingenuity and wit. The time^during which I associate with 
the family is, therefore, rendered agreeable to me, and that 
which I employ in my chamber is quiet and uninterrupted, 
leaving me the means of that close application which I find 
indispensably necessary and without which I should even 
tually disgrace this new institution. On this subject I feel a 
concern and solicitude which you who know my natural dis 
position will readily conceive, and which is much increased 
by the high expectations which I continually hear are formed 
from my appointment. I know how apt high expectations 
are to be disappointed, and foresee the probability of adding 
to the number of such examples; hence the present is a mo 
ment of anxiety as well as of labor, and I need all the tran 
quillity I can obtain to keep a due possession of myself. 



152 THE WRITINGS OF [1806 

QUINCY, 13 July, 1806. 

I have seen in the newspapers some account of the new 
disputes between the two Randolphs, 1 and some of them have 
gone so far as to appoint the day upon which they were to 
meet, which they fixed on the 28th of last month. But I 
have seen a Richmond Enquirer of 4 July in which the war 
seems still carried on upon paper, in which I suppose it will 
end. As far as I have seen there is no real cause alleged for 
which they could reasonably quarrel, and if either of them 
should kill the other, he would be very much puzzled to give 
himself or to any other person the why. But the real reason 
is concealed. The real reason is the antagonism of ambition 
and the rankling at heart of political opposition. I hope 
they will take care to shoot none but the paper bullets of the 
brain. 

The newspapers have pretended that William Smith 2 (my 
sister s son) was one of the persons taken in Miranda s 
schooner. But this was a misrepresentation or mistake. 
They have had letters from William dated 12 June, after the 
capture of the schooner, when he was yet safe. But would 
you believe that the Marquis Yrujo wrote a letter to Gen 
eral Dayton with intimations that William Smith was one 
of the prisoners; that they would all be put to death unless 
by some powerful intercession some single individuals of 
them might be spared, and that He would intercede for 
William on condition that Colonel Smith would discover to 
him everything that he knew of Miranda s plans, and the 
names of the Spaniards with him, and in short everything 
that could be confessed by a criminal under sentence of death

to save himself. 1 The Colonel returned a very spirited, in 
dignant and proper answer. I wish William was at home. I 
wish neither he nor his father had ever had any concern with 
this knight-errant expedition. But I had rather tremble, 
nay, I had rather weep, for my friends than blush for them. 
Yrujo knows little of Colonel Smith or of any person who 
feels an interest of blood or of affection in his sons, if he 
thought they would save his life upon such a proposition. 
It gives a despicable opinion of his own heart that he could 
make it or expect any advantage from it. The Colonel s 
trial is fixed for tomorrow, and unhappily Judge Paterson 
will not be there. What the government means to do for 
him or Ogden 2 time will show. 3 As far as relates to Colonel 
Smith the President I should think has already done enough. 
He has ruined him as completely as his heart could wish. 
More is unnecessary. . . . 



TO NOAH WEBSTER 

QUINCY, 5 November, 1806. 
SIR: 

I received some time since through the hands of Judge 
Dawes your favor of 12 August, together with a copy of 
your Dictionary, and a newspaper containing the strictures 
of a critic at Albany, and your reply to them. 4 My thanks 
for your obliging present ought ere this to have been returned 
to you, and would have been but for a pressure of occupation

154 THE WRITINGS OF [1806 

at this time, and from a desire with full deliberation to give 
you my candid opinion respecting your project for a larger 
Dictionary. 

There are three objections made against your plan by the 
critic of Albany, relating first, to your peculiarities of spell 
ing; secondly, to your principles of pronunciation, and 
thirdly, to the introduction into your Dictionary of local 
vulgarisms. 

With regard to the two first I have always considered 
them as under the absolute dominion of fashion. And as we 
are in the habit of receiving all our fashions from England, 
this has been regularly imported with the rest. I have never 
thought it a subject worth contending about. It is true we 
can manufacture words, as we can manufacture broad-cloths, 
for ourselves. And we can insist upon spelling or pronounc 
ing them as they ought to be, or as our great grandfathers 
spelt or pronounced them, as we can dress in the costume of 
the seventeenth century, or cut our clothes upon a philo 
sophical principle of convenience, if we please. Every in 
dividual must in this respect act for himself. A patriotic 
spirit will from a sense of duty encourage a domestic manu 
facture, but to prescribe their use by law, and to prohibit the 
introduction of them from Great Britain, is at least of more 
questionable policy, and perhaps not quite so practicable. 

Alterations of spelling or pronunciation upon the authority 
of a single writer have an inevitable tendency to introduce 
confusion into a language. Voltaire undertook to introduce 
a new system of spelling into the French language. Yet his 
authority has not even to this day generally prevailed, and 
the greater part of the French nation spell as their fathers did. 
Many writers however have followed his example, and a 
numerous class of words are consequently spelt two different 
ways. I am apprehensive that your example and authority 



i8o6] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 155 

may produce a similar inconvenience to the writers and 
speakers of English. That is, if you adhere to the intention 
of setting up a standard of spelling or pronunciation dif 
ferent from that which is admitted in England. 

The sentiments indeed which you express to me in your 
letter of the inconveniences and impracticability of attempt 
ing to impose dogmas upon others in respect to pronunciation 
are so perfectly congenial to my own, that I could not but 
regret to find that our inference from these principles was not 
exactly the same. My own conclusion is to take the stand 
ard as I find it, and shun all controversy upon the subject. 
Yours, I observe, is to take nearly the standard of Entick, 
and to reject all subsequent changes as innovations of the 
English stage and court. That innovation in many of the 
cases where you differ from them is chargeable upon them, 
and not upon you, I readily believe; but the question seems 
to be, not who was the innovator, but whether a different 
and a hostile standard shall be resorted to. Now if I deemed 
a new standard necessary, I know not where I could find one 
which I should prefer to yours. But I am not entirely con 
vinced that any new one is desirable. 

Your remark that the English lexicographers are not 
agreed among themselves, is undoubtedly a strong argument 
to dissuade us from absolute and unqualified submission to 
any one of them. 1 Nor is the authority of any of them con 
sidered as irrefragable. Each of them has his influence, and 
his peculiarities are adopted or rejected according to the 
weight of his reasons or the fluctuations of public taste. 
Standing on the same ground with them as a philologist, your 

1 "August II, 1807. Mr. Monroe, the printer, of the partners Oliver and Monroe, 
came to me to write him proposals for publishing an edition of Johnson s large Dic 
tionary, and requested me to superintend the publication; the last of which I de 
clined." Ms. Diary. 



156 THE WRITINGS OF [1806 

opinions will doubtless have their deserved weight; but I do 
not think it your wish, nor should I deem it proper, to engage 
national prejudices or passions in the cause. I would neither 
adopt nor reject a mode of spelling or of pronunciation, 
either from deference or from resistance to the English Court 
or stage. I would not agree with them to prove my conde 
scension, nor differ from them to mark my independence. 

With respect to the introduction into your Dictionary of 
new words your reasoning, both in the preface and in your 
reply to the critic at Albany, is forcible, and to a certain de 
gree conclusive. Where we have invented new words, or 
adopted new senses to old words, it appears but reasonable 
that our dictionaries should contain them. Yet there are 
always a multitude of words current within particular neigh 
borhoods, or during short periods of time, which ought never 
to be admitted into the legitimate vocabulary of a language. 
A very good proportion of the words of American origin are 
of this description, and I confess that I should prefer to see 
them systematically excluded, rather than hunted up for 
admission into a dictionary of classical English. In your 
undertaking to compile a large Dictionary to supersede those 
which come to us from England, it must doubtless be neces 
sary to proceed upon some general principle. Yet I presume 
you will not think it necessary to insert a great number of 
words which are in very common use. Between vulgarism 
and propriety of speech some line must be drawn, and where 
that shall precisely be may perhaps be a question of some 
difficulty. Your liberality of admission in the compendious 
Dictionary extends so far, that I should prefer to find in the 
larger work a restriction rather than an enlargement of it. 

I have not had an opportunity of exchanging sentiments 
with President Webber or Professor Ware with respect to 
your undertaking, and know not how far they would deem it 



i8o6] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 157 

advisable to pledge our University to support your system 
of spelling, pronunciation, or of departure from the English 
language. Though not entirely coinciding with you in opin 
ion upon these subjects, I hope you will be persuaded of the 
sincerity with which I appreciate your genius and learning, 
and of my respect for the depth and extent of your researches 
upon this and other subjects of high moment to our country. 
I have thought a free and explicit avowal of my own impres 
sions would be most satisfactory to you, in answer to the 
confidence with which you had favored me, although the 
principles which I have accustomed myself to apply in these 
cases have led me to deductions, differing in some respects 
from yours. I am, &C. 1

158 THE WRITINGS OF [1807 

TO JOHN ADAMS 

WASHINGTON, January 27, 1807. 

Mr. Burr and his conspiracy have begun to occupy our 
attention. Last Friday (23d) the Senate with closed doors 
passed an act suspending in certain cases the privilege of the 
writ of habeas corpus. The business was finished in one day, 
with a slight opposition from Mr. Bayard, who voted alone 
against the bill, but did not use his privilege of forbidding the 
reading of the bill three times on the same day. 1 The House 
of Representatives adjourned over until Monday before we 
had finished. Yesterday morning the message and the bill 
were sent to them in confidence. 2 They immediately opened 
their doors, and almost unanimously rejected the bill at the 
first reading. I have enclosed to you the papers from the 
President upon which the Senate acted. Bollman and 
Swartwout 3 who were arrested by General Wilkinson are 
now here, and it seems questionable what can be done with 
them. The general subject is yet mysterious, but there is a 
concurrence of testimony establishing facts more important, 
as they respect the operation of our Institutions, and future 
prospects of this country than most of us appear to be 
aware of. 

These two subjects and the projects for prohibiting the 
importation of slaves into the United States after i January 
next exclusively engross our attention. We have in the two

houses had seven different printed bills for this purpose; and 
at length we have passed a bill in Senate which has this day 
gone to the House of Representatives. 

30 January. 

The part I have taken in the business of the last three 
days, and the important transactions now going on in the 
Circuit Court here, have prevented me from finishing this 
letter. I inclose you a newspaper in which you will find the 
proceedings hitherto on the singular cases of Bollman and 
Swartwout, which are still under argument, by the District 
Attorney l and present Attorney General, 2 on a motion for 
their commitment on a charge of treason, and by the late 
Attorney General, Mr. Charles Lee, and a young Mr. Key, 3 
for the prisoners. They are now before the Court, and excite 
such universal curiosity that we are scarcely able here to 
form a quorum to do business and the House of Representa 
tives actually adjourned this morning for want of a quorum. 

We were almost without public business during the first 
six weeks of the session, and I employed the leisure time 
principally to prepare for my labors of the ensuing spring. 
I have also continued my application to the Greek, and have 
read through the Odyssey in the original. I selected this 
because I have it in a single small volume with a Latin version 
at the side, but without a commentary. There is no great 
plenty of Greek books here. I found so long as the mind was 
unagitated by other subjects of meditation, and the feelings 
in a state of tranquillity, I could read and understand Homer 
much better than I can since the public business has taken 
hold of me. I now read without understanding much.

I have been taken off from the possibility of finishing my 
letter by a debate which I have been obliged to support for 
the whole of this day, on a bill of little importance, but which 
I happened to report. Upon such bills I have never had the 
good fortune to escape hard pushing and struggling; but we 
passed half a dozen other bills without raising half an hour s 
discussion. 

It is now almost four. The Circuit Court have committed

tional amendment, or motion, originating in the Senate, and requiring three read 
ings previous to its being passed, shall be, whether it shall be engrossed and read a 
third time? And no amendment shall be received for discussion at the third reading 
of any bill, resolution, amendment, or motion, unless by unanimous consent of the 
members present." The motion was amended and after debate was adopted

less interest and agitation in its stead. Two of his agents, Bollman and Swartwout, 
who were employed to seduce General Wilkinson and the army, and whom the Gen

July 1 6, 1807. 

Whereas, by the communication from Norfolk, Portsmouth, and 
their vicinities, and the Proclamation of the President of the United 
States, it appears the sovereignty of our country has been insulted, 
and the lives of our citizens sacrificed, by the unjustifiable conduct 
of a British armed ship. 

1. Resolved, That we consider the unprovoked attack made on 
the United States armed ship the Chesapeake, by the British ship 
of war the Leopard, a wanton outrage upon the lives of our fellow 
citizens, a direct violation of our national honor, and an infringe 
ment of our national rights and sovereignty. 

2. Resolved, That we most sincerely approve the Proclamation, 2 
and the firm and dispassionate course of policy pursued by the 
President of the United States; and we will cordially unite with 

he says, he never can forgive, and I suspect he has since included the last among the 
number." Louisa Catherine Adams to John Quincy Adams, February 15, 1807. 

On February 24, Adams appears to have made a speech on the Chesapeake and 
Delaware Canal Bill; but its argument is known only through the reply made by 
Samuel White of Delaware. Annals of Congress, Qth Cong., 2nd Sess., 80. 

1 Intelligence of the attack upon the Chesapeake by the British ship the Leopard 
reached Boston June 30. The federalists saw no reason for calling a town meeting, 
but their opponents issued a notice of a public meeting to be held at the New State 
House on July 10. The resolutions, pledging support to the measures of Admin 
istration, were framed by a committee, of which Barnabas Bidwell was chairman. 
Next to his name came that of John Quincy Adams, the only federalist of reputation 
present at the meeting. The federalists recognizing their error, joined in a town 
meeting, held in Faneuil Hall, on July 16; the occasion being the letter from the 
citizens of Norfolk, describing the situation in Virginia. A committee was named to 
prepare the resolutions, and John Quincy Adams was chairman. With him were 
associated Harrison Gray Otis, William Eustis, Christopher Gore (who was not 
present and did not participate in the meeting), Dr. Charles Jarvis, John C. Jones, 
Thomas H. Perkins, and Dr. John Warren. The resolutions, drafted by Adams, 
and unanimously adopted by the meeting, received the approval of all citizens, 
irrespective of party. Adams, Memoirs, July 10, 16, 1807. New England Federal

our fellow citizens in affording effectual support to such measures, 
as our Government may further adopt in the present crisis of our 
affairs. 

3. Resolved, That we remember with pride and pleasure, the 
patriotic and spirited conduct of the citizens of Norfolk, Ports 
mouth, and their vicinities, before the orders of Government were 
known, upon this momentous occasion; and they are entitled to the 
thanks and approbation of their fellow citizens throughout the 
Union. 

4. Resolved, That the Selectmen be requested to return a suit

citizens at Norfolk, with the proceedings of this meeting.

MOTION ON IMPRESSMENTS 

November 25, 1807. 

Resolved, That the President of the United States be requested 
to cause to be laid before the Senate a return of the number of 
American seamen impressed or detained by British armed vessels, 
whose names have been reported to the Department of State since 
the last statement made to Congress; mentioning the names of the 
persons impressed, the time and place of their impressment, the 
names of the ships, and, as far as may be known, of the officers by 
whom they were impressed, together with any material facts or 
circumstances in relation to the same; stating, also, the whole 
number of seamen impressed since the commencement of the 
present war, what number of the persons impressed, according to 
the last statement of the Secretary of State, has since been restored, 
and the numbers still detained by the British, since demand of 
their restoration made; with the reasons assigned for their deten

TO JOHN ADAMS 

WASHINGTON, 30 November, 1807. 
MY DEAF. SIR: 

I received a few days since your very kind letter which I 
am ashamed of answering by a few lines, but by some acci 
dent I have fallen from a state of almost total idleness into 
an overwhelming flood of business, which leaves me scarcely 
a quarter of an hour of the day or of the night. I sent you 
last week a copy of a volume in the form of a bill which I re 
ported upon the aggression business, and which is now under 
debate. The mere scribe-work of its compilation (for not 
much of it is my own), and the attendance upon a large com 
mittee where it was discussed before it came into the Senate, 

1 Annals of Congress, loth Cong., ist Sess., I. 38. 



1 64 THE WRITINGS OF [1807 

have already employed me with sufficient industry. But on 
Friday last Mr. John Smith of Ohio made his appearance 
here and was going to take his seat. A resolution for a com 
mittee of inquiry whether he ought not to be expelled was 
immediately offered, which after some debate was substan 
tially adopted. A committee of seven was raised, of which 
I have the misfortune to be chairman. 1 I did not introduce 
any one of the proposed resolutions and, as you will see by 
the printed debates, took very little part in the discussion. 
It was a subject which of all others I was desirous of avoid 
ing, but in vain. The principles and facts involved in this 
inquiry are of a compass and magnitude at which I hardly 
dare to look, and the solicitude to discharge my duty op 
presses me beyond measure. 

I remain of my first opinion on my arrival here. The 
President s policy is procrastination, and if Great Britain does 
not wage complete war upon us, we shall end with doing 
nothing this session. . . . 

TO JOSEPH HALL 2 

WASHINGTON, December n, 1807. 


The ground taken by our government on the subject of 
the attack upon the Chesapeake has been sanctioned even 
by the British ministry, who in the most unqualified manner 
have disavowed the orders of Admiral Berkeley, have dis 
claimed in the most pointed terms every pretension to search 
a national ship for deserters; and have declared themselves 
willing to make proper reparation for the aggression. You 
know that I was as averse to the encouragement or enlist-

ment of deserters, as the warmest friend to the British navy 
could possibly be; and that I thought our government ought 
to keep this identical outrage entirely separate from every other 
topic of controversy. This opinion I still retain; and if the 
extraordinary mission from England should be accomplished 
on principles avowed by Mr. Canning, I have no doubt that 
war between the two nations may yet be avoided. To this end I 
would contribute every possible aid to soften points of con 
troversy which can be left open, to retreat from extremities 
which can be shunned, and to preserve peace where I can 
have no hope left that the parties can ever meet upon terms 
of amity. 

With respect to the non-importation act, I wish you to 
understand that it is no favorite of mine. I have to some 
urged its immediate repeal; not with a view to any effect 
which it can produce upon Great Britain; but with reference 
to its probable effect among ourselves. It had my approba 
tion two years ago, because the merchants throughout the 
Union called upon Congress for some measure to aid nego 
tiation with England; and because the administration, and a 
great portion of our people, had a confidence in its efficacy, 
which could only be tested by experience. The experiment 
has been made. Whatever good effect it could produce it 
seems to me is past. It is too much, or too little, for the 
present state of things; and its effects will distress our own 
people, without producing the purpose for which it was in 
tended beyond the Atlantic. I believe the administration, 
for their own sakes, ought to give it up. But so long as the 
executive, the responsible department, believes that this 
measure will help and not hinder them in negotiation, I 
think its repeal ought not to be pressed by its opponents in 
Congress. Your petition, as I presume it will be, if couched 
in respectful terms, without tincture of party spirit, I have 



1 66 THE WRITINGS OF [1807 

no doubt will be treated with due consideration; and may 
perhaps be acceptable to the government, as furnishing an 
apology for abandoning what I believe they do not rely upon 
with much confidence. There is a bill now before the House 
to modify the act, and I suppose any modification for which 
you ask, may be introduced into it, if they should be thought 
just. . . . 

TO JOHN ADAMS 

WASHINGTON, 27 December, 1807. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

Your favor of the I4th instant came to my hands just at a 
moment to renew and to strengthen impressions which had 
been weighing heavily upon my mind for near a month. The 
general questions relating to the powers and processes of 
expulsion under our Constitution had been forced upon me 
by the situation in which I was placed as chairman of the 
committee on the present inquiry. My own inclinations 
would have led me to investigations of a different kind, for 
which indeed I was making preparations and collecting ma 
terials. This subject however came on quite unexpectedly, 
and still more unexpectedly was it made my duty to take the 
principal labor of its management upon myself. The com 
mittee have been in session almost every day, Saturday and 
Christmas day not excepted, since their appointment. Their 
report is now ready and will be presented in the course of a 
very few days. It is long, and has been agreed to by the 
committee almost to a line as drafted by myself. It will 
probably form a subject of animated discussion on the ques 
tion of acceptance and, if printed, I shall immediately send 
you a copy. If its principles should not meet your approba 
tion, it will be a subject of the deepest regret to me. But 



i8o 7 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 167 

even then, I think you will find in it internal evidence that 
its errors, if such you should deem them, have not arisen 
from carelessness or inattention. That they should have pro 
ceeded from any less excusable origin I am sure you will not 
suspect. 

I perceive, by the newspapers and by letters from more 
than one of my friends, that the bill which has here com 
monly been termed the aggression bill, and which was also 
reported by me as chairman of the committee, has excited 
surmises and occasioned imputations among my federal 
friends not very auspicious to their good opinion of me. I 
think that when I inclosed you a copy of the bill I informed 
you that scarcely any of its provisions were mine, although 
I gave the bill as it passed the Senate my vote and my sup 
port. I know not anything that has given me so much pleas 
ure as to have learnt by a letter from Dr. Waterhouse that 
you approved its principles. I have, however, inferred from 
your silence respecting it and from some other circumstances, 
that you supposed it a measure too high-toned for our situa 
tion and perhaps hazardous to our peace. That may pos 
sibly be. It passed by a vote almost unanimous in Senate, 
but has not finally been acted upon in the House of Repre 
sentatives. It may, therefore, be considered as indicative 
of the tone of sentiment in the Senate particularly with re 
gard to the affair of the Chesapeake, and to the support of our 
own authority within our own jurisdiction. That I have 
contributed to the best of my abilities, and as far as my very 
slender influence in that body extended, to pledge them by 
this bill to the assertion and support of its principles, I can 
never deny. But I had evidence too clearly irrefragable of 
the temper prevailing through both branches of Congress to 
fear, that any measure which might unnecessarily endanger 
the peace of the nation would be over hastily adopted. 



i68 THE WRITINGS OF [1807 

Our prospects have indeed been growing more gloomy 
from day to day. And we have now, at the express call of 
the President, an unlimited embargo. To this measure, also, 
as merely precautionary and defensive, I gave my assent 
and vote. It was in Senate carried through in one day, but 
was contested with much more violence in the other House. 1 
Under the decrees of France and Great Britain dooming to 
capture and confiscation all our ships and cargoes trading 
with either of those powers, we had no other alternative left 
but this, or taking our side at once in the war. I do not be 
lieve indeed that the embargo can long be continued; but if 
we let our ships go out without arming them and authorizing 
them to resist the decrees, they must go merely to swell the 
plunder of the contending parties. 2 

1 On December 18 a message from the President was read in the Senate calling 
attention to the increasing dangers to American vessels, seamen and merchandise, 
threatened on the high seas and elsewhere, by the belligerent powers of Europe. A 
committee was at once appointed, composed of Samuel Smith, John Quincy Adams, 
Joseph Anderson, Stephen R. Bradley, and Andrew Gregg; which reported on the 
same day an embargo on all ships and vessels in the ports and harbors of the United 
States. The bill was, by a suspension of the rules, given a second reading on that 
day, and was then passed by a vote of twenty-two to six, Adams voting in the 
affirmative. Annals of Congress, loth Cong., 1st Sess., I. 50. See Henry Adams, 
History, IV. 153; American State Papers, Foreign Relations, III. 25. 

2 "When the committee had assembled, we had some doubts of the propriety of 
the measure [embargo]. Mr. Adams, in particular, was with difficulty, brought to 
consent to it. General [Samuel] Smith stated the reasons which influenced the 
Executive, and when the committee at last agreed unanimously to recommend the 
measure to the Senate, it was fully understood by them that the bill should pass as 
soon as possible: and I think Gen. Smith was instructed, that if any objections were 
made, he should move that the rule of the Senate which required that the three 
readings of Bills should be on three different days, be suspended, which he after 
ward did. 

"The reasons which influenced the committee to recommend that course were, 
that, if the bill laying an embargo were to be eight or ten days in passing the two 
Houses, a number of merchants would in the meantime send out their vessels loaded 
with provisions, for ten or twelve months, and defeat the object of the embargo. 



i8o 7 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 169 

The British proclamation, 1 expressly commanding impress 
ment from our merchant vessels and assuming in fact a 
right of annulling our laws of naturalization, has given again 
a new and darker complexion to our old controversies on that 
subject. We ought not I think to suffer this new encroach 
ment, and yet I know not how we can take a stand against it 
without coming to immediate war. Mr. Canning in his cor 
respondence with Mr. Monroe has insisted very strenuously 
upon keeping the case of the Chesapeake distinct from all 
other subjects of negotiation between us; and yet the proc 
lamation itself improperly connects them, by taking occa 
sion with the disclaimer of the right of search in national 
ships to place upon new ground and under the formal tenor 
of a proclamation the pretension to impress from merchant 
vessels. 

There are some important lights in which this question of 
impressment has not yet been presented to the people of this 
country. You have seen the resolution which I offered in 
Senate some weeks since, to request from the President in 
formation as to the impressments within the two last years. 
The returns have not yet been made. 2 

If it would not be too troublesome to you I would intreat 

And as they would make great profits, those that might be taken by the embargo 
would feel themselves much injured, and become hostile to the government. It is 
injurious that Mr. Pickering should attach so much wrong to Mr. Adams, as I am 
confident that some other members of the committee pressed the passing of the 
act, in the manner related, in as strong terms as Mr. Adams. He might as well 
have censured the whole Senate, except Mr. Pickering, Mr. Crawford and four or 
five others who opposed the bill: ... I further well recollect, that as we passed 
from the committee room to the Senate, Mr. Adams observed to me: This measure 
will cost you and me our seats, but private interest must not be put in opposition 
to public good. " Letter of Stephen Row Bradley, September 21, 1824.

you to send me an account, as minute and particular as your 
recollection will admit, of the case of the man whom you de 
fended for killing Lieutenant Panton. 1 If you have any 
minutes of the trial, or any means of reference to your argu 
ment, the authorities you adduced, and the opinion of the 
court, they might be of service to me. 2 I think I have heard 
you say that in that case it was admitted by that decision, 
that the practice of impressment was even then held to be 
inadmissible in the colonies. 

I would also thank you for your opinion on the following 
points. Is not the impressment of a native born American 
citizen from an American vessel in point of principle pre 
cisely the same thing, as if a British recruiting officer from 
Canada should come within our lines and forcibly take away 
a man to make him a British soldier? And is not this forcible 
levying of recruits by the officer of one nation within the 
jurisdiction of another the offence against the laws of nations 
known by the name of plagiat or man-stealing? And is not 
that offence by the universal usage of civilized nations 
punished with death? 

Is there any law or usage of nations which forbids an Amer 
ican merchant or master of a vessel from engaging by con 
tract a foreign seaman to serve him as a sailor upon a lawful 
voyage ? 

Is not every seaman thus engaged by signing a shipping 
paper according to law? And is not the personal service of a 
seaman thus engaged a debt ? 

I put the case of deserting from ships of war, or any other 
vessel, out of the question; but setting that aside, if the 
personal service of a British seaman has become by contract a 
debt to an American merchant, and if a British officer is

warranted and ordered by his government forcibly to take 
the seaman away from the service to which he is bound, is it 
not in principle an undertaking by the British government 
to cancel a debt due by the individual of one nation to the 
individual of the other, and as such in substance a direct 
violation of the tenth article of Mr. Jay s treaty? 

Perhaps these last questions may at first blush carry an 
appearance of refinement in their train of reasoning more 
than they really deserve. I will thank you to weigh delib 
erately the nature of the contract between seamen and their 
owners, and the moral reason professedly assigned in the 
tenth article of the treaty for placing contracts between in 
dividuals even beyond the reach of war, and say whether the 
forcible dissolution of contract, which must be involved in 
every case of impressment, does not violate the substance if 
not the form of that article? 1 

These are not the only subjects of public concern upon 
which I feel the want of your judgment and advice. My 
situation here at this moment is singular and critical. My 
views of present policy, and my sense of the course en 
joined upon me by public duty, are so different from those of 
the federalists that I find myself in constant opposition to 
them. Yet I have no communication with the administra 
tion but that which my place in the Senate of course implies. 2

distrust and suspicion. Even when concurring in my opin 
ions, some of them betray an involuntary anxiety lest their 
popularity should be affected by having their names go out 
as supporters of measures linked with mine. This temper 
does, indeed, appear in some small degree to be v/earing off, 
but any trifle light as air would restore it in all its vigor. Yet 
since the commencement of the present session I have been 
placed upon every committee of national importance, and 
made the reporter of several. Without having the weight of 
a single vote besides my own in point of personal influence, I 
find myself charged with the duty of originating and con 
ducting measures of the highest interest. I am made a leader 
without followers. Until the present session I have always 
had two friends (Tracy and Plumer) with whom I could 
consult in the most intimate and confidential manner and 
on whose friendship I could always rely, almost always upon 
their concurrence. But death has removed one of them, 1 
and changes of political party the other. I am compelled, 
therefore, to lean upon my own judgment more than it will 
always bear. My only consolation is in the consciousness 
of good intentions and unwearied attention to my duty. 
Man can give no more, the rest must be left to a higher

REPORT ON SENATOR JOHN SMITH 3 

The committee appointed to inquire whether it be compatible 
with the honor and privileges of the house that John Smith a 
Senator from the State of Ohio against whom bills of indictment 
were found at the Circuit Court of Virginia held at Richmond in 
August last for treason and misdemeanor should be permitted any 
longer to have a seat therein and to inquire into all the facts re 
garding the conduct of Mr. Smith as an alleged associate of Aaron 
Burr and report the same to the Senate submit the following re 
port: 

Your committee are of opinion, that the conspiracy of Aaron 
Burr and his associates against the peace, union, and liberties of 
these states, is of such a character, and that its existence is estab 
lished by such a mass of concurring and mutually corroborative 
testimony, that it is incompatible not only with the honor and 
privileges of this House, but with the deepest interests of this na 
tion, that any person engaged in it should be permitted to hold a 
seat in the Senate of the United States. 

Whether the facts, of which the committee submit herewith 
such evidence as, under the order of the Senate, they have been 
able to collect, are sufficient to substantiate the participation of

174 THE WRITINGS OF [1807 

Mr. Smith in that conspiracy, or not, will remain for the Senate to 
decide. 

The committee submit also to the consideration of the Senate, 
the correspondence between Mr. Smith and them, through their 
chairman, in the course of their meetings. The committee have 
never conceived themselves invested with authority to try Mr. 
Smith. Their charge was to report an opinion relating to the honor 
and privileges of the Senate, and the facts relating to the conduct 
of Mr. Smith. Their opinion, indeed, cannot be expressed in re 
lation to the privilege of the Senate, without relating, at the same 
time, to Mr. Smith s right of holding a seat in this body; but, in 
that respect, the authority of the committee extends only to pro- 
posal, and not to decision. But as he manifested a great solicitude 
to be heard before them, they obtained permission from the Senate 
to admit his attendance, communicated to him the evidence in their 
possession, by which he was inculpated, furnished him, in writing, 
with the questions arising from it, which appeared to them mate 
rial, and received from him the information and explanations here 
with submitted as part of the facts reported. But Mr. Smith has 
claimed, as a right, to be heard in his defence by counsel, to have 
compulsory process for witnesses, and to be confronted with his 
accusers, as if the committee had been a circuit court of the United 
States. But it is before the Senate itself that your committee 
conceived it just and proper that Mr. Smith s defence of himself 
should be heard. Nor have they conceived themselves bound in 
this inquiry by any other rules than those of natural justice and 
equity, due to a brother Senator on the one part, and to their 
countrymen on the other. 

Mr. Smith represents himself, on this inquiry, as solitary, friend 
less, and unskilled, contending for rights which he intimates are 
denied him; and the defender of senatorial privileges which he 
seems apprehensive will be refused him by Senators, liable, so 
long as they hold their offices, to have his case made their own. 
The committee are not unaware that, in the vicissitudes of human 
events, no member of this body can be sure that his conduct will 



i8o 7 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 175 

never be made a subject of inquiry and decision before the assem 
bly to which he belongs. They are aware that, in the course of 
proceeding which the Senate may now sanction, its members are 
marking out a precedent which may hereafter apply to themselves. 
They are sensible that the principles upon which they have acted 
ought to have the same operation upon their own claims to privi 
lege as upon those of Mr. Smith; the same relation to the rights of 
their constituents, which they have to those of the legislature which 
he represents. They have deemed it their duty to advance in the 
progress of their inquiry with peculiar care and deliberation. They 
have dealt out to Mr. Smith that measure, which, under the sup 
position of similar circumstances, they would be content to find 
imparted to themselves; and they have no hesitation in declaring 
that, under such imputations, colored by such evidence, they 
should hold it a sacred obligation to themselves, to their fellow 
Senators, and to their country, to meet them by direct, uncondi 
tional acknowledgment or denial, without seeking a refuge from 
the broad face of day in the labyrinth of technical forms. 

In examining the question whether these forms of judicial pro 
ceedings, or the rules of judicial evidence, ought to be applied to 
the exercise of that censorial authority which the Senate of the 
United States possesses over the conduct of its members, let us 
assume, as the test of their application, either the dictates of un 
fettered reason, the letter and spirit of the Constitution, or prece 
dents, domestic or foreign, and your committee believe that the 
result will be the same; that the power of expelling a member must, 
in its nature, be discretionary, and in its exercise always more 
summary than the tardy process of judicial tribunals. 

The power of expelling a member for misconduct results, on the 
principles of common sense, from the interest of the nation, that 
the high trust of legislation should be invested in pure hands. 
When the trust is elective, it is not to be presumed that the con 
stituent body will commit the deposits to the keeping of worthless 
characters. But when a man, whom his fellow-citizens have 
honored with their confidence, on the pledge of a spotless reputa- 



176 THE WRITINGS OF [1807 

tion, has degraded himself by the commission of infamous crimes, 
which become suddenly and unexpectedly revealed to the world, 
defective indeed would be that institution which should be im 
potent to discard from its bosom the contagion of such a member; 
which should have no remedy of amputation to apply until the 
poison had reached the heart. 

The question upon the trial of a criminal cause, before the courts 
of common law, is not between guilt and innocence, but between 
guilt and the possibility of innocence. If a doubt can possibly be 
raised, either by the ingenuity of the party or of his counsel, or 
by the operation of general rules in their unforeseen application to 
particular cases, that doubt must be decisive for acquittal, and the 
verdict of not guilty, perhaps, in nine cases out of ten, means no 
more than that the guilt of the party has not been demonstrated 
in the precise, specific, and narrow forms prescribed by law. The 
humane spirit of the laws multiplies the barriers for the protection 
of innocence, and freely admits that these barriers may be abused 
for the shelter of guilt. It avows a strong partiality favorable to 
the person upon trial, and acknowledges the preference that ten 
guilty should escape rather than that one innocent should suffer. 
The interest of the public that a particular crime should be pun 
ished, is but as one to ten, compared with the interest of the party, 
that innocence should be spared. Acquittal only restores the party 
to the common rights of every other citizen; it restores him to no 
public trust; it invests him with no public confidence; it substitutes 
the sentence of mercy for the doom of justice; and to the eyes of 
impartial reason, in the great majority of cases, must be considered 
rather as a pardon than a justification. 

But when a member of a legislative body lies under the imputa 
tion of aggravated offences, and the determination upon his cause 
can operate only to remove him from a station of extensive powers, 
and important trust, this disproportion between the interest of the 
public and the interest of the individual disappears; if any dispro 
portion exists, it is of an opposite kind. It is not better than ten 
traitors should be members of this Senate than that one innocent 



i8o 7 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 177 

man should suffer expulsion. In either case, no doubt, the evil 
would be great. But in the former, it would strike at the vitals 
of the nation; in the latter it might, though deeply to be lamented, 
only be the calamity of an individual. 

By the letter of the Constitution, the power of expelling a mem 
ber is given to each of the two Houses of Congress, without any 
limitation other than that which requires a concurrence of two- 
thirds of the votes to give it effect. 

The spirit of the Constitution is, perhaps, in no respect more 
remarkable than in the solicitude which it has manifested to secure 
the purity of the legislature by that of the elements of its composi 
tion. A qualification of age is made necessary for the members 
to ensure the maturity of their judgment; a qualification of long 
citizenship, to ensure a community of interests and affections be 
tween them and their country; a qualification of residence, to 
provide a sympathy between every member and the portion of the 
Union from which he is delegated; and to guard, as far as regulation 
can guard, against every bias of personal interest, and every hazard 
of interfering duties, it has made every member of Congress in 
eligible to office which he contributed to create, and every officer of 
the Union incapable of holding a seat in Congress. Yet, in the 
midst of all this anxious providence of legislative virtue, it has not 
authorized the constituent body to recall in any case its representa 
tive. It has not subjected him to removal by impeachment; and 
when the darling of the people s choice has become their deadliest 
foe, can it enter the imagination of a reasonable man that the 
sanctuary of their legislation must remain polluted with his 
presence, until a court of common law, with its pace of snail, can 
ascertain whether his crime was committed on the right or on the 
left bank of a river; whether a puncture of difference can be found 
between the words of the charge and the words of the proof; 
whether the witnesses of his guilt should or should not be heard by 
his jury; and whether he was punishable, because present at an 
overt act, or intangible to public justice, because he only contrived 
and prepared it? Is it conceivable that a traitor to that country 



1 7 8 THE WRITINGS OF [1807 

which has loaded him with favors, guilty to the common under 
standing of all mankind, should be suffered to return unquestioned 
to that post of honor and confidence, where, in the zenith of his 
good fame, he had been placed by the esteem of his countrymen, 
and in defiance of their wishes, in mockery of their fears, sur 
rounded by the public indignation, but inaccessible to its bolt, 
pursue the purposes of treason in the heart of the national coun 
cils? Must the assembled rulers of the land listen with calmness 
and indifference, session after session, to the voice of notorious 
infamy, until the sluggard step of municipal justice can overtake 
his enormities? Must they tamely see the lives and fortunes of 
millions, the safety of present and future ages, depending upon his 
vote, recorded with theirs, merely because the abused benignity 
of general maxims may have remitted to him the forfeiture of his 
life? 

Such, in very supposable cases, would be the unavoidable con 
sequences of a principle which should offer the crutches of judicial 
tribunals as an apology for crippling the congressional power of 
expulsion. Far different, in the opinion of your committee, is the 
spirit of our Constitution. They believe that the very purpose for 
which this power was given was to preserve the legislature from 
the first approaches of infection. That it was made discretionary 
because it could not exist under the procrastination of general 
rules; that its process must be summary, because it would be ren 
dered nugatory by delay. 

Passing from the constitutional view of the subject to that 
which is afforded by the authority of precedent, your committee 
find that, since the establishment of our present National legis 
lature, there has been but one example of expulsion from the Sen 
ate. In that case, the member implicated was called upon, in the 
first instance, to answer whether he was the author of a letter, the 
copy of which only was produced, and the writing of which was 
the cause of his expulsion. He was afterwards requested to declare 
whether he was the author of the letter itself, and declining, in 
both cases, to answer, the fact of his having written it was estab- 



i8o 7 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 179 

lished by a comparison of his hand-writing, and by the belief of 
persons who had seen him write, upon the inspection of the letter. 
In all those points the committee perceive the admission of a 
species of evidence, which, in courts of criminal jurisdiction, would 
be excluded, and, in the Resolution of expulsion, the Senate de 
clared the person inculpated guilty of a high misdemeanor, although 
no presentment or indictment had been found against him, and no 
prosecution at law was ever commenced upon the case. 

This event occurred in July, 1797. About fifteen months before 
that time, upon an application from the legislature of Kentucky, 
requesting an investigation by the Senate of a charge against one 
of the members from that State, of perjury, which had been made 
in certain newspaper publications, but for which no prosecution 
had been commenced, the Senate did adopt, by a majority of six 
teen votes to eight, the report of a committee, purporting that the 
Senate had no jurisdiction to try the charge, and that the memorial 
of the Kentucky legislature should be dismissed. There were, 
indeed, very sufficient reasons of a different kind assigned in the 
same report, for not pursuing the investigation, in that partic 
ular case, any further; and your committee believe that, in the 
reasoning of that report, some principles were assumed and some 
inferences drawn, which were altogether unnecessary for the deter 
mination of that case, which were adopted without a full consider 
ation of all their consequences, and the inaccuracy of which was 
clearly proved by the departure from them in the instance which 
was so soon afterwards to take place. It was the first time that a 
question of expulsion had ever been agitated in Congress, since 
the adoption of the Constitution. And the subject being thus en 
tirely new, was considered perhaps too much with reference to the 
particular circumstances of the moment, and not enough upon the 
numerous contingencies to which the general question might 
apply. Your committee state this opinion with some confidence, 
because of the sixteen Senators who, in March, 1796, voted for the 
report dismissing the memorial of the Kentucky legislature; eleven, 
on the subsequent occasion, in July, 1797, voted also for that re- 



i8o THE WRITINGS OF [1807 

port, which concluded with a resolution for the expulsion of Mr. 
Blount. The other five were no longer present in the Senate. Yet, 
if the principles advanced in the first report had been assumed as 
the ground of proceeding at the latter period, the Senate would 
have been as impotent of jurisdiction upon the offence of Mr. 
Blount as they had supposed themselves upon the allegation against 
Mr. Marshall. 

Those parts of the fifth and sixth articles, amendatory to the 
Constitution, upon which the report in the case of Mr. Marshall 
appears to rely for taking away the jurisdiction of the Senate, your 
Committee suppose can only be understood as referring to prose 
cutions at law; to suppose that they were intended as restrictions 
upon powers expressly granted by the Constitution to the legisla 
ture, or either of its branches, would in a manner annihilate the 
power of impeachment as well as that of expulsion. It would lead 
to the absurd conclusion that the authority given for the purpose 
of removing iniquity from the seats of power, should be denied its 
exercise in precisely those cases which most loudly call for its en 
ergies. It would present the singular spectacle of a legislature 
vested with power of expelling its members, of impeaching, remov 
ing, and disqualifying public officers, for trivial transgressions be 
neath the cognizance of the law, yet forbidden to exert them against 
capital or infamous crimes. 

Those two articles were in substance borrowed from similar 
regulations contained in that justly celebrated statute, which for 
so many ages has been distinguished by the name of the Great 
Charter of England. Yet in that country, where they are recog 
nized as the most solid foundations of the liberties of the nation, 
they have never been considered as interfering with the power of 
expelling a member, exercised at all times by the House of Com 
mons; a power which there, however, rests only upon parliamentary 
usage, and has never been bestowed, as in the Constitution of the 
United States, by any act of supreme legislation. From a number 
of precedents which have been consulted, it is found that the exer 
cise of this authority there has always been discretionary, and its 



i8o 7 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 181 

process always far otherwise than compendious in the prosecutions 
before the judicial courts. So far, indeed, have they been from 
supposing a conviction at law necessary to precede a vote of ex 
pulsion, that, in one instance, a resolution to demand a prosecution 
appears immediately after the adoption of the resolution to expel. 
In numerous cases the member submits to examination, adduces 
evidence in his favor and has evidence produced against him, with 
or without formal authentication; and the discretion of the House 
is not even restricted by the necessary concurrence of more than a 
bare majority of the votes. 

The provision in our Constitution which forbids the expulsion 
of a member by an ordinary majority, and requires for this act of 
rigorous and painful duty the assent of two-thirds, your committee 
consider as a wise and sufficient guard against the possible abuse 
of this legislative discretion. In times of heat and violent party 
spirit, the rights of the minority might not always be duly re 
spected, if a bare majority could expel their members under no 
other control than that of their own discretion. The operation of 
this rule is of great efficacy, both over the proceedings of the whole 
body, and over the conduct of every individual member. The 
times when the most violent struggles of contending parties oc 
cur when the conflict of opposite passions is most prone to ex 
cess are precisely the times when the numbers are most equally 
divided; when the majority amounts to the proportion of two- 
thirds the security in its own strength is of itself a guard against 
extraordinary stretches of power; when the minority dwindles to 
the proportion of one-third, its consciousness of weakness dis 
suades from any attempts to encroach upon the rights of the 
majority, which might provoke retaliation. But if expulsion were 
admissible only as a sequel to the issue of a legal prosecution, or 
upon the same principles and forms of testimony which are estab 
lished in the criminal courts, your committee can see no possible 
reason why it should be rendered still more imbecile by the req 
uisition of two-thirds to give it effect. 

It is now the duty of your committee to apply the principles 



182 THE WRITINGS OF [1807 

which they have here endeavored to settle and elucidate, to the 
particular case upon which the Senate have directed them to report. 
The bills of indictment found against Mr. Smith, at the late session 
of the circuit court of the United States at Richmond, (copies of 
which are herewith submitted,) are precisely similar to those found 
against Aaron Burr. From the volume of printed evidence com 
municated by the President of the United States to Congress, re 
lating to the trial of Aaron Burr, it appears that a great part of the 
testimony which was essential to his conviction upon the indict 
ment for treason, was withheld from the jury upon an opinion of 
the court, that Aaron Burr, not having been present at the overt 
act of treason alleged in the indictment, no testimony relative to 
his conduct or declarations elsewhere, and subsequent to the 
transactions on Blennerhassett s Island could be admitted. And, 
in consequence of this suppression of evidence, the traverse jury 
found a verdict "that Aaron Burr was not proved to be guilty, 
under that indictment, by any evidence submitted to them." It 
was also an opinion of the court, that none of the transactions, of 
which evidence was given on the trials of Aaron Burr, did amount 
to an overt act of levying war, and, of course, that they did not 
amount to treason. These decisions, forming the basis of the issue 
upon the trials of Burr, anticipated the event which must have 
awaited the trials of the bills against Mr. Smith, who from the cir 
cumstances of his case, must have been entitled to the benefit of 
their application; they were the sole inducements upon which the 
counsel for the United States abandoned the prosecution against 
him. 

Your committee are not disposed now to question the correct 
ness of those decisions on a case of treason before a court of crim 
inal jurisdiction. But whether the transactions proved against 
Aaron Burr did or did not amount, in technical language, to an 
overt act of levying war, your committee have not a scruple of 
doubt upon their minds that, but for the vigilance and energy of 
the government, and of faithful citizens under its directions, in 
arresting their progress and in crushing his designs, they would, 



i3o 7 J JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 183 

in a very short lapse of time, have terminated not only in war, but 
in a war of the most horrible description, in a war at once foreign 
and domestic. As little hesitation have your committee in saying, 
that, if the daylight of evidence combining one vast complicated 
intention, with overt acts innumerable, be not excluded from the 
mind by the curtain of artificial rules, the simplest understanding 
cannot but see what the subtlest understanding cannot disguise, 
crimes before which ordinary treason whitens into virtue; crimes 
of which war is the mildest feature. The debauchment of our 
army, the plunder and devastation of our own and of foreign terri 
tories, the dissolution of our national Union, and the root of in 
terminable civil war, were but the means of individual aggrandize 
ment, the steps to projected usurpation. If the ingenuity of a de 
mon were taxed to weave, into one composition, all the great moral 
and political evils which could be inflicted upon the people of these 
States, it could produce nothing more than a texture of war, dis 
memberment, and despotism. Of these designs, a grand jury, 
composed of characters as respectable as this nation can boast, 
have, upon the solemnity of their oaths, charged John Smith with 
being an accomplice. The reasons upon which the trial of this 
charge has not been submitted to the verdict of a jury, have been 
shown by your committee, and are proved by the letter from the 
Attorney of the United States for the District of Virginia, herewith 
reported. And your committee are of opinion that the dereliction 
of the prosecution on those grounds cannot, in the slightest degree, 
remove the imputation which the accusations of the grand jury 
have brought to the door of Mr. Smith. 

Your committee will not permit themselves to comment upon 
the testimony which they submit herewith to the Senate; nor upon 
the answers which Mr. Smith has given as sufficient for his justifi 
cation. Desirous as the committee have been that this justifica 
tion might be complete, anxiously as they wished for an oppor 
tunity of declaring their belief of his innocence, they can neither 
control nor dissemble the operation of the evidence upon their 
minds; and however painful to their feelings, they find themselves 



1 84 THE WRITINGS OF [1807 

compelled by a sense of duty, paramount to every other consid 
eration, to submit to the Senate, for their consideration the follow 
ing resolution: 

Resolved, That John Smith, a Senator from the State of Ohio, by 
his participation in the conspiracy of Aaron Burr against the -peace, 
Union, and liberties, of the people of the United States, has been 
guilty of conduct incompatible with his duty and station as a 
Senator of the United States. And that he be therefor, and hereby 
is, expelled from the Senate of the United States. 1 

1 "No document has been before us, during the present session, more extraordinary 
than the one I now enclose the report of my colleague in the case of John Smith, 
Senator from Ohio. To you any comments, if I had now time to make them, would 
be impertinent." Pickering to Rufus King, January 2, 1808. Life and Correspond 
ence of Rufus King, V. 44. "I cannot fail to express my serious regret that the 
report in the case of John Smith was drawn up by your colleague. The times are 
not such as allow men of learning to express slight opinions concerning the forms and 
independence of the Judiciary; under any circumstance a want of consideration in 
this respect would be indiscreet; at a period when so much war and prejudice pre 
vail concerning the importance of this department of government, it is eminently 
the duty of enlightened men to avoid everything that may seem to justify and 
encourage the innovations which ignorant and wicked men meditate." King to 
Pickering, January 7, 1808. Ib., 50. Plumer learned that the report had given 
"mortal offense" in New Hampshire, and sixteen years later Pickering asserted 
that there were passages in it which "outraged, I believe, every distinguished 
lawyer in America." See Mass. Hist. Soc. Proceedings, XLV. 356. A series of 
severe strictures on the report appeared in the New York Evening Post, Janu 
ary, 1808, ostentatiously addressed to Adams as "a Senator of the United States and 
professor of Oratory in Massachusetts," and speaks of him as "once a federalist." 
See also Adams, Memoirs, January 7, and April 9, 1808. 

In Lowell s Remarks on the review of Ames Works (p. 25), he reminded Adams, 
that "there are those amongst us who have not forgotten the report in the case of 
Senator Smith, where justice, so far from being sacred in her temple, was to be 
dragged from her seat to perform the polluting office of private revenge; where the 
snail-like pace of the common law seemed to be too tardy for those who thirsted 
for victims; and where the eager minister of presidential vengeance seemed to sigh 
after the mild mercies of the star chamber, and the rapid movements of the revolu 
tionary tribunal." 

"I remember that on my way home last May you informed me that J. Q. Adams 
had called on you; and in speaking of the acquittal of John Smith of Ohio, he 
ascribed it to Mr. Jefferson whom he supposed to be in Smith s hands. This un-

TO JAMES SULLIVAN 

WASHINGTON, 10 January, 1808. 
SIR: 

I lose not a moment in answering your Excellency s in 
quiries with regard to the causes of the embargo so far as they 
were understood by me. 

1. It was explicitly recommended by the President in a 
message communicating a decision by order of the French 
Emperor, that the decree of 21 November, 1806, should be 
strictly executed against the Americans, as well as all others; 
and also the British proclamation commanding their naval 
officers to impress British subjects from our vessels. 

2. The answer of Mr. Rose, transferring the negotiations 
between Great Britain and this country from London to this 
place, was considered as an extraordinary and suspicious cir 
cumstance. There were reasons for supposing that the tone 
of Mr. Rose s instructions would be so arrogant and over 
bearing that they would be deemed inadmissible here, and 
the negotiation arrested at the threshold. It was thought 
probable that the British squadron on our coast would have 
instructions to commence hostilities immediately on the 
rupture of the negotiation, and prudence seemed to call for a 
measure which would avoid exposing to capture any of our 
vessels which might be issuing from our ports. The occur 
rences since Mr. Rose s arrival have tended very much to con 
firm these expectations. He has raised a punctilio without 
landing concerning the treatment not of himself, but of the 
ship in which he came; and the British ship Triumph has 

doubtedly was the fact. If you recollect any fact, stated by J. Q. A. as the ground 
of his opinion, I should be glad to know it." Pickering to Rufus King, January 21, 
1809. King replied that no fact was mentioned in support of this opinion. Life 
and Correspondence of Rufus King, V. 129, 132. 



1 86 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

been into Lynn Haven Bay, and received dispatches from 
the station. 

3. There was all but official intelligence that the British 
king had issued a retaliating proclamation to counteract that 
of France, and of equal extent. It was obvious that between 
the two, every American vessel that should be permitted to 
sail would go to almost certain capture and condemnation. 
A temporary suspension of their departure was thought 
therefore necessary. 

4. It was probable that the embargo, by throwing out of 
employment the British sailors in this country, would induce 
them to return of their own accord to the ships of their own 
sovereign. To me this was a very desirable circumstance, for 
I believed it would take away the only pretext the British 
have to offer for engaging in a quarrel with us. 

5. It was an experiment to see how far the Government 
might calculate upon the support of the people for the main 
tenance of their own rights. It was useful and might be of im 
portance to the country, to commence this experiment and 
observe its effects before the negotiation with Mr. Rose 
should commence. 

On the whole I considered it as a measure eminently cal 
culated for the preservation of peace, as it would at once 
diminish the temptations and opportunities of the enemy to 
commence war against us, and as it would prepare our own 
people for an acquiescence in terms on our part, which, with 
out sacrificing any of our rights, might still go further to 
conciliation than the temper of the people would have 
brooked without it. Yet it was a measure so necessarily dis 
tressing to ourselves, that I should have hesitated upon it, 
but for the decisive recommendation of the President. 

The letters of Messrs. Armstrong and Champagny about 
which so much has been said, related solely to the decree of 



i8os] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 187 

21 November, 1806. Nothing more was communicated to 
Congress. It was, however, in my mind a measure merely 
precautionary and which I had and have no idea will be 
of long continuance. General embargoes of six or twelve 
months, of which some gentlemen talk so lightly, never 
entered my brain as practicable things in a great com 
mercial country. I question whether an example of the 
kind can be found in history. 
I am, etc. 



MOTION ON THE EMBARGO 

January n, 1808. 

Resolved, That a committee be appointed, with leave to report 
by bill or otherwise, and instructed to inquire at what period the 
present embargo can, consistently with the public interest, be re 
moved; and whether, in what manner, and to what extent, upon 
its removal, the merchant vessels of the United States shall be 
permitted, in defence of their lawful commerce, to be armed against, 
and to resist, foreign aggression. 1 

1 Annals of Congress, loth Cong., ist Sess., I. 79; Adams, New England Federalism, 
190. The motion was defeated by a vote of ten to seventeen. "I am glad to see 
your motion on the embargo; it will do good for those who are opposed to that 
measure to have an opportunity to express their minds." James Sullivan to John 
Quincy Adams, January 23, 1808. Ms. "A suffering community will thank Mr. 
Adams for proposing an inquiry: but as the Legislature evidently did not know 
why they laid it on, they cannot know why nor when they ought to take it off. 
They professed to be governed by the President s recommendation, and they must 
wait his pleasure." The Repertory, February 2, 1808. A report on the case of the 
ship Manilla, prepared by Adams, is in Annals of Congress, loth Cong., ist Sess.,

1 88 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

TO JOHN ADAMS 

WASHINGTON, 27 January, 1808. 

MY DEAR SIR: 

I have already written you a very long letter in answer to 
your favor of the 8th instant, 1 and after writing it upon read 
ing it over concluded the best disposition I could make of it 
would be to burn it. Accordingly the flames have consumed 
it, and I must begin again. 

Your answers and observations upon my inquiries re 
specting the impressment of our seamen by the British are 
of the highest interest. But this general question has been 
absorbed by the new decrees of the great contending bel 
ligerent powers. Right and wrong are no longer subjects of 
discussion in our concerns with European nations. They 
appear to be agreed in the determination that there shall be 
no more neutrality, and our only choice is which of the two 
we will resist. 

I am very sensible of that situation in which you consider 
me to stand, and that being now wholly unsupported by any 
great party the expiration of my present term of service will 
dismiss me from my public station. By this event my vanity 
may be affected, but in every other respect it will be a relief. 
Deeming it inconsistent with my duties ever to shrink from 
the service of my country I have always adhered to the prin 
ciple that I should not solicit any of its favors. The present 
time and the prospects of the nation are such that a seat in 
the public councils cannot be an object of my desire. My 
literary profession and the education of my children will 
occupy all my time in a manner which will furnish me duties 
enough to discharge. I shall also resume the practice of the 

1 Printed in Mass. Hist. Soc. Proceedings, XLIV. 422. 



1 8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 189 

law as far as that will resume me, and although this is a 
business for which I know myself to be indifferently qualified, 
I shall still pursue it as far as my circumstances will admit. 1 
Notwithstanding the critical situation of the country the 
two Houses of Congress are acting very much at their leisure, 
and from their present proceedings one would imagine we 
were in a state of profound peace. The presidential election 
engrosses the principal attention of the members. About 
one-half the members of both houses here have declared in 
favor of Mr. Madison and to re-elect the Vice President. In 
the legislature of Virginia, also, the friends of Mr. Madison 
have outnumbered those of Mr. Monroe nearly three to one. 
I understand that by way of making a temporary provision 
for Mr. Monroe he is to be chosen Governor of Virginia. . . . 

TO HARRISON GRAY OTIS 2 

WASHINGTON, March 31, 1808. 
DEAR SIR: 

I have received from one of my friends in Boston a copy 
of a printed pamphlet, containing a letter from Mr. Pick- 

1 "Your situation you think critical; I think it is clear, plain, and obvious. You 
are supported by no party; you have too honest a heart, too independent a mind, 
and too brilliant talents, to be sincerely and confidentially trusted by any man 
who is under the dominion of party maxims or party feelings. And where is there 
another man who is not? You may depend upon it then that your fate is decided. 
You will be countenanced neither by France, Spain or England. You will be sup 
ported neither by federalists nor republicans. In the next Congress Dr. Eustis will 
be chosen senator, and you will be numbered among the dead, like Jay, Ellsworth, 
King, Ames, Dexter, and a hundred others of the brightest geniuses of the country. 
You ought to know and expect this, and by no means to regret it. Return to your 
professorship, but above all to your office as a lawyer. Devote yourself to your 
profession and the education of your children." John Adams to John Quincy Adams, 
January 8, 1808. Ms. On the interview with Jefferson, March 15, see Adams, 
Memoirs, I. 521; New England Federalism, 12, 24. 

^he occasion for this pamphlet is related in the "Appendix," prepared in 1824, 



190 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

ering to the Governor of the Commonwealth, intended for 
communication to the legislature of the State, during their 
session, recently concluded. But this object not having been 
accomplished, it appears to have been published by some 
friend of the writer, whose inducement is stated, no doubt 
truly, to have been the importance of the matter discussed 
in it, and the high respectability of the author. 

The subjects of this letter, are the embargo, and the dif 
ferences in controversy between our country and Great 
Britain subjects upon which it is my misfortune, in the 
discharge of my duties as a Senator of the United States, to 
differ from the opinions of my Colleague. The place where 
the question upon the first of them, in common with others 
of great national concern, was between him and me, in our 
official capacities a proper object of discussion, was the 
Senate of the Union. There it was discussed, and, as far 

and now reprinted (p. 224, infra). Although the name of Adams did not appear in 
Pickering s pamphlet, the intention of the attack could not be mistaken. Published 
in the last hours of the session of the General Court, immediately before the State 
election, on the result of which would hang the choice of a United States senator to 
fill the place then occupied by Adams, it served as an active electioneering device 
in a community dependent upon commerce, and already experiencing the effects 
of the embargo. March 16, Adams received a copy of Pickering s pamphlet, and 
prepared this reply, which appeared April 9. See Adams, New England Federalism^ 
194. 

" I had the honour to receive your letter to Mr. Otis on Thursday evening last, and 
have attended to its publication, with as much expedition as possible. The printers

morning, and the whole are now disposed of. Oliver and Munroe are now printing 
a second edition of a thousand more on their own account and have contracted with 
several of the democrats, with Eben Larkin bookseller at their head, to print three 
thousand more for general circulation in the Country. In consequence of the great 
haste with which they were printed, some few errors have escaped us, which I shall 
see corrected in the second edition. I sent you several copies last evening and now

as the constitutional authority of that body extended, there 
it was decided. Having obtained alike the concurrence of 
the other branch of the national legislature, and the approba 
tion of the President, it became the law of the land, and as 
such I have considered it entitled to the respect and obedience 
of every virtuous citizen. 

From these decisions, however, the letter in question is 
to be considered in the nature of an appeal; in the first in 
stance, to our common constituents, the legislature of the 
State; and in the second, by the publication, to the people. 
To both these tribunals I shall always hold myself account 
able for every act of my public life. Yet, were my own 
political character alone implicated in the course which has 
in this instance been pursued, I should have forborne all 
notice of the proceeding, and have left my conduct in this, 
as in other cases, to the candor and discretion of my Country. 

But to this species of appeal, thus conducted, there are 
some objects on constitutional grounds, which I deem it my 
duty to mention for the consideration of the public. On a 
statement of circumstances attending a very important act 
of national legislation, a statement which the writer un 
doubtedly believed to be true, but which comes only from 
one side of the question and which, I expect to prove in the 
most essential points erroneous, the writer with the most 
animated tone of energy calls for the interposition of the 
commercial States, and asserts that "nothing but their 
sense, clearly and emphatically expressed, will save them 
from ruin." This solemn and alarming invocation is ad 
dressed to the legislature of Massachusetts, at so late a 
period of their session, that had it been received by them, 
they must have been compelled either to act upon the views 
of this representation, without hearing the counter statement 
of the other side, or seemingly to disregard the pressing in- 



192 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

terest of their constituents, by neglecting an admonition of 
the most serious complexion. Considering the application 
as a precedent, its tendency is dangerous to the public. For 
on the first supposition, that the legislature had been pre 
cipitated to act on the spur of such an instigation, they must 
have acted on imperfect information, and under an excite 
ment, not remarkably adapted to the composure of safe de 
liberation. On the second they would have been exposed to 
unjust imputations, which at the eve of an election might 
have operated in the most inequitable manner upon the 
characters of individual members. 

The interposition of one or more State legislatures, to 
control the exercise of the powers vested by the general 
Constitution in the Congress of the United States, is at least 
of questionable policy. The views of a State legislature are 
naturally and properly limited in a considerable degree to the 
particular interests of the State. The very object and for 
mation of the national deliberative assemblies was for the 
compromise and conciliation of the interests of all of the 
whole nation. If the appeal from the regular, legitimate 
measures of the body where the whole nation is represented, 
be proper to one State legislature, it must be so to another. 
If the commercial States are called to interpose on one hand, 
will not the agricultural States be with equal propriety sum 
moned to interpose on the other? If the East is stimulated 
against the West, and the Northern and Southern Sections 
are urged into collision with each other, by appeals from the 
acts of Congress to the respective States in what are these 
appeals to end ? 

It is undoubtedly the right, and may often become the 
duty of a State legislature, to address that of the nation, 
with the expression of its wishes, in regard to interests pe 
culiarly concerning the State itself. Nor shall I question the 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 193 

right of every member of the great federative compact to 
declare its own sense of measures interesting to the nation 
at large. But whenever the case occurs that this sense 
should be "clearly and emphatically" expressed, it ought 
surely to be predicated upon a full and impartial considera 
tion of the whole subject not under the stimulus of a 
one-sided representation far less upon the impulse of con 
jectures and suspicions. It is not through the medium of 
personal sensibility, nor of party bias, nor of professional 
occupation, nor of geographical position, that the whole 
truth can be discerned, of questions involving the rights and 
interests of this extensive Union. When their discussion is 
urged upon a State legislature, the first call upon its members 
should be to cast all their feelings and interests as the citi 
zens of a single State into the common stock of the national 
concern. 

Should the occurrence upon which an appeal is made from 
the councils of the nation, to those of a single State be one, 
upon which the representation of the State had been divided, 
and the member who found himself in the minority, felt im 
pelled by a sense of duty to invoke the interposition of his 
constituents, it would seem that both in justice to them, and 
in candor to his colleague, some notice of such intention 
should be given to him, that he too might be prepared to ex 
hibit his views of the subject upon which the difference of 
opinion had taken place; or, at least that the resort should 
be had, at such a period of time as would leave it within the 
reach of possibility for his representations to be received, by 
their common constituents, before they would be compelled 
to decide on the merits of the case. 

The fairness and propriety of this course of proceeding 
must be so obvious, that it is difficult to conceive of the pro 
priety of any other. Yet it presents another inconvenience 



i 9 4 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

which must necessarily result from this practice of appellate 
legislation. When one of the senators from a State proclaims 
to his constituents that a particular measure, or system of 
measures which has received the vote and support of his 
colleague, are pernicious and destructive to those interests 
which both are bound by the most sacred of ties, with zeal 
and fidelity to promote, the denunciation of the measures 
amounts to little less than a denunciation of the man. The 
advocate of a policy thus reprobated must feel himself sum 
moned by every motive of self-defence to vindicate his con 
duct: and if his general sense of his official duties would bind 
him to the industrious devotion of his whole time to the pub 
lic business of the session, the hours which he might be forced 
to employ for his own justification, would of course be de 
ducted from the discharge of his more regular and appropri 
ate functions. Should these occasions frequently recur, they 
could not fail to interfere with the due performance of the 
public business. Nor can I forbear to remark the tendency 
of such antagonizing appeals to distract the councils of the 
State in its own legislature, to destroy its influence, and ex 
pose it to derision, in the presence of its sister States, and to 
produce between the colleagues themselves mutual asperities 
and rancors, until the great concerns of the nation would 
degenerate into the puny controversies of personal alterca 
tion. 

It is therefore with extreme reluctance that I enter upon 
this discussion. In developing my own views and the prin 
ciples which have governed my conduct in relation to our 
foreign affairs, and particularly to the embargo, some very 
material differences in point of fact as well as of opinion, will 
be found between my statements, and those of the letter, 
which alone can apologize for this. They will not, I trust, 
be deemed in any degree disrespectful to the writer. Far 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 195 

more pleasing would it have been to me, could that honest 
and anxious pursuit of the policy best calculated to promote 
the honor and welfare of our country, which, I trust, is felt 
with equal ardor by us both, have resulted in the same opin 
ions, and have given them the vigor of united exertion. 
There is a candor and liberality of conduct and of sentiment 
due from associates in the same public charge, towards each 
other, necessary to their individual reputation, to their 
common influence, and to their public usefulness. In our 
republican government, where the power of the nation con 
sists alone in the sympathies of opinion, this reciprocal def 
erence, this open hearted imputation of honest intentions, is 
the only adamant at once attractive and impenetrable, that 
can bear, unshattered, all the thunder of foreign hostility. 
Ever since I have had the honor of a seat in the national 
councils, I have extended it to every department of the 
government. However differing in my conclusions, upon 
questions of the highest moment, from any other man, of 
whatever party, I have never, upon suspicion, imputed his 
conduct to corruption. If this confidence argues ignorance of 
public men and public affairs, to that ignorance I must plead 
guilty. I know, indeed, enough of human nature to be sen 
sible that vigilant observation is at all times, and that sus 
picion may occasionally become necessary, upon the conduct 
of men in power. But I know as well that confidence is the 
only cement of an elective government. Election is the very 
test of confidence, and its periodical return is the constitu 
tional check upon its abuse; of which the electors must of 
course be the sole judges. For the exercise of power, where 
man is free, confidence is indispensable; and when it once 
totally fails, when the men to whom the people have com 
mitted the application of their force, for their benefit, are 
to be presumed of the vilest of mankind, the very foundation 



196 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

of the social compact must be dissolved. Towards the gentle 
man whose official station results from the confidence of the 
same legislature, by whose appointment I have the honor of 
holding a similar trust, I have thought this confidence pe 
culiarly due from me, nor should I now notice his letter, not 
withstanding the disapprobation it so obviously implies at 
the course which I have pursued in relation to the subjects of 
which it treats, did it not appear to me calculated to produce 
upon the public mind, impressions unfavorable to the rights 
and interests of the nation. 

Having understood that a motion in the Senate of Massa 
chusetts was made by you, requesting the Governor to trans 
mit Mr. Pickering s letter to the legislature, together with 
such communications, relating to public affairs, as he might 
have received from me, 1 I avail myself of the circumstance, 
and of the friendship which has so long subsisted between 
us, to take the liberty of addressing this letter, intended for 
publication, to you. Very few of the facts which I shall state 
will rest upon information peculiar to myself. Most of them 
will stand upon the basis of official documents, or of public 
and undisputed notoriety. For my opinions, though fully 
persuaded, that even where differing from your own, they 
will meet with a fair and liberal judge in you, yet of the 
public I ask neither favor nor indulgence. Pretending to no 
extraordinary credit from the authority of the writer, I am 
sensible they must fall by their own weakness, or stand by 
their own strength. 

The first remark which obtrudes itself upon the mind 
upon the perusal of Mr. Pickering s letter is, that in enumer 
ating all the pretences (for he thinks there are no causes) for 
the embargo, and for a war with Great Britain, he has totally 
omitted the British Orders of Council of November n, 1807, 

1 Columbian Centinel, March 9, 1808. The motion was negatived. 



JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 197 

those orders under which millions of the property of our 
fellow citizens, are now detained in British hands, or con 
fiscated to British captors, those orders, under which tenfold 
as many millions of the same property would have been at 
this moment in the same predicament, had they not been 
saved from exposure to it by the embargo, those orders, 
which if once submitted to and carried to the extent of their 
principles, would not have left an inch of American canvas 
upon the ocean, but under British license and British taxa 
tion. An attentive reader of the letter, without other infor 
mation, would not even suspect their existence. They are 
indeed in one or two passages, faintly, and darkly alluded to 
under the justifying description of "the orders of the British 
government, retaliating the French imperial decree: " but as 
causes for the embargo, or as possible causes or even pre 
tences of war with Great Britain, they are not only unnoticed, 
but their very existence is by direct implication denied. 

It is indeed true, that these orders were not officially 
communicated with the President s message recommending 
the embargo. They had not been officially received. But 
they were announced in several paragraphs from London and 
Liverpool newspapers of the loth, nth and I2th of Novem 
ber, which appeared in the National Intelligencer of i8th 
December, the day upon which the embargo message was 
sent to Congress. The British government had taken care 
that they should not be authentically known before their 
time for the very same newspapers which gave this in 
official notice of these orders, announced also the departure 
of Mr. Rose, upon a special mission to the United States. 
And we know that of these all-devouring instruments of 
rapine Mr. Rose was not even informed. His mission was 
professedly a mission of conciliation and reparation for a 
flagrant, enormous, acknowledged outrage. But he was not 



198 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

sent with these Orders of Council in his hands. His text 
was the disavowal of Admiral Berkeley s conduct. The 
commentary was to be discovered on another page of the 
British ministerial policy. On the face of Mr. Rose s instruc 
tions, these Orders of Council were as invisible, as they are 
on that of Mr. Pickering s letter. 

They were not merely without official authenticity. Ru 
mors had for several weeks been in circulation derived from 
English prints, and from private correspondences, that such 
orders were to issue; and no inconsiderable pains were taken 
here to discredit the fact. Assurances were given that there 
was reason to believe no such orders to be contemplated. 
Suspicion was lulled by declarations equivalent nearly to a 
positive denial: and these opiates were continued for weeks 
after the embargo was laid, until Mr. Erskine received in 
structions to make the official communication of the orders 
themselves, in their proper shape, to our government. 

Yet, although thus unauthenticated, and even although 
thus in some sort denied, the probability of the circumstances 
under which they were announced, and the sweeping tend 
ency of their effects, formed to my understanding a power 
ful motive, and together with the papers sent by the Presi 
dent, and his express recommendation, a decisive one, for 
assenting to the embargo. As a precautionary measure, I 
believed it would rescue an immense property from depreda 
tion, if the orders should prove authentic. If the alarm was 
groundless, it must very soon be disproved, and the embargo 
might be removed with the danger. 

The omission of all notice of these facts in the pressing 
enquiries "why the Embargo was laid?" is the more surpris 
ing, because they are of all the facts, the most material, upon 
a fair and impartial examination of the expediency of that 
Act, when it passed. And because these orders, together 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 199 

with the subsequent " retaliating decrees" of France and 
Spain, have furnished the only reasons upon which I have 
acquiesced in its continuance to this day. If duly weighed, 
they will save us the trouble of resorting to jealousies of 
secret corruption, and the imaginary terrors of Napoleon for 
the real cause of the embargo. These are fictions of foreign 
invention. The French Emperor had not declared that he 
would have no neutrals. He had not required that our ports 
should be shut against British commerce but the Orders 
of Council if submitted to would have degraded us to the 
condition of colonies. If resisted would have fattened the 
wolves of plunder with our spoils. The embargo was the 
only shelter from the Tempest the last refuge of our 
violated peace. 

I have indeed been myself of opinion that the embargo, 
must in its nature be a temporary expedient, and that prep 
arations manifesting a determination of resistance against 
these outrageous violations of our neutral rights ought at 
least to have been made a subject of serious deliberation in 
Congress. I have believed and do still believe that our in 
ternal resources are competent to the establishment and 
maintenance of a naval force, public and private, if not fully 
adequate to the protection and defence of our commerce, at 
least sufficient to induce a retreat from these hostilities and 
to deter from a renewal of them, by either of the warring 
parties; and that a system to that effect might be formed, 
ultimately far more economical, and certainly more energetic 
than a three years embargo. Very soon after the closure of 
our ports, I did submit to the consideration of the Senate, a 
proposition for the appointment of a committee to institute 
an enquiry to this end. But my resolution met no encourage 
ment. Attempts of a similar nature have been made in the 
House of Representatives, but have been equally discoun- 



200 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

tenanced, and from these determinations by decided major 
ities of both houses, I am not sufficiently confident in the 
superiority of my own wisdom to appeal, by a topical ap 
plication to the congenial feelings of any one not even of 
my own native section of the Union. 

The embargo, however, is a restriction always under our 
own control. It was a measure altogether of defence and of 
experiment. If it was injudiciously or over-hastily laid, it 
has been every day since its adoption open to a repeal: if it 
should prove ineffectual for the purposes which it was meant 
to secure, a single day will suffice to unbar the doors. Still 
believing it a measure justified by the circumstances of the 
time, I am ready to admit that those who thought otherwise 
may have had a wiser foresight of events, and a sounder 
judgment of the then existing state of things than the 
majority of the national legislature, and the President. It 
has been approved by several of the State legislatures, and 
among the rest by our own. Yet of all its effects we are still 
unable to judge with certainty. It must still abide the test 
of futurity. I shall add that there were other motives which 
had their operation in contributing to the passage of the act, 
unnoticed by Mr. Pickering, and which having now ceased 
will also be left unnoticed by me. The Orders of Council of 
nth November still subsist in all their force; and are now 
confirmed, with the addition of taxation, by act of Parlia 
ment. 

As they stand in front of the real causes for the embargo, 
so they are entitled to the same pre-eminence in enumerating 
the causes of hostility, which the British ministers are ac 
cumulating upon our forbearance. They strike at the root 
of our independence. They assume the principle that we 
shall have no commerce in time of war, but with her domin 
ions, and as tributaries to her. The exclusive confinement of 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 201 

commerce to the mother country, is the great principle of the 
modern colonial system; and should we by a dereliction of our 
rights at this momentous stride of encroachment surrender 
our commercial freedom without a struggle, Britain has but 
a single step more to take, and she brings us back to the 
stamp act and the tea tax. 

Yet these orders thus fatal to the liberties for which 
the sages and heroes of our revolution toiled and bled 
thus studiously concealed until the moment when they burst 
upon our heads thus issued at the very instant when a mis 
sion of atonement was professedly sent in these orders we 
are to see nothing but a "retaliating order upon France" 
in these orders, we must not find so much as a cause nay 
not so much as a pretence, for complaint against Britain. 

To my mind, sir, in comparison with those orders, the three 
causes to which Mr. Pickering explicitly limits our grounds 
for a rupture with England, might indeed be justly denom 
inated pretences; in comparison with them, former aggres 
sions sink into insignificance. To argue upon the subject of 
our disputes with Britain, or upon the motives for the em 
bargo, and keep them out of sight, is like laying your finger 
over the unit before a series of noughts, and then arith 
metically proving that they all amount to nothing. 

It is not however in a mere omission, nor yet in the history 
of the embargo, that the inaccuracies of the statement I am 
examining have given me the most serious concern it is 
in the view taken of the questions in controversy between 
us and Britain. The wisdom of the embargo is a question of 
great, but transient magnitude, and omission sacrifices no 
national right. Mr. Pickering s object was to dissuade the 
nation from a war with England, into which he suspected the 
administration was plunging us, under French compulsion. 
But the tendency of his pamphlet is to reconcile the nation, 



202 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

or at least the commercial states, to the servitude of British 
protection, and war with all the rest of Europe. Hence Eng 
land is represented as contending for the common liberties of 
mankind, and our only safe-guard against the ambition and 
injustice of France. Hence all our sensibilities are invoked 
in her favor, and all our antipathies against her antagonist. 
Hence, too, all the subjects of difference between us and 
Britain are alleged to be on our part mere -pretences, of 
which the right is unequivocally pronounced to be on her 
side. Proceeding from a Senator of the United States, spe 
cially charged as a member of the executive with the main 
tenance of the nation s rights, against foreign powers, and 
at a moment extremely critical of pending negotiation upon 
all the points thus delineated, this formal abandonment of the 
American cause, this summons of unconditional surrender to 
the pretensions of our antagonist, is in my mind highly alarm 
ing. It becomes therefore a duty to which every other con 
sideration must yield to point out the errors of this repre 
sentation. Before we strike the standard of the nation, let 
us at least examine the purport of the summons. 

And first, with respect to the impressment of our seamen. 
We are told that "the taking of British seamen found on 
board our merchant vessels, by British ships of war, is 
agreeably to a right, claimed and exercised for ages." It is 
obvious that this claim and exercise of ages, could not apply 
to us, as an independent people. If the right was claimed 
and exercised while our vessels were navigating under the 
British flag, it could not authorize the same claim when their 
owners have become the citizens of a sovereign state. As a 
relict of colonial servitude, whatever may be the claim of 
Great Britain, it surely can be no ground for contending that 
it is entitled to our submission. 

If it be meant that the right has been claimed and exer- 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 203 

cised for ages over the merchant vessels of other nations, I 
apprehend it is a mistake. The case never occurred with 
sufficient frequency to constitute even a practice, much less 
a right. If it had been either, it would have been noticed by 
some of the writers on the laws of nations. The truth is, the 
question arose out of American independence from the 
severance of one nation into two. It was never made a 
question between any other nations. There is therefore no 
right of prescription. 

But, it seems, it has also been claimed and exercised, during 
the whole of the three administrations of our national gov 
ernment. And is it meant to be asserted that this claim and 
exercise constitute a right? If it is, I appeal to the uniform, 
unceasing and urgent remonstrances of the three adminis 
trations I appeal not only to the warm feelings, but cool 
justice of the American people nay, I appeal to the sound 
sense and honorable sentiment of the British nation itself, 
which, however, it may have submitted at home to this prac 
tice, never would tolerate its sanction by law, against the 
assertion. If it is not, how can it be affirmed that it is on our 
part a mere pretence? 

But the first merchant of the United States, in answer to 
Mr. Pickering s late enquiries has informed him that since 
the affair of the Chesapeake there has been no cause of com 
plaint that he could not find a single instance where they 
had taken one man out of a merchant vessel. Who it is, that 
enjoys the dignity of first merchant of the United States we 
are not informed. 1 But if he had applied to many merchants 
in Boston as respectable as any in the United States, they 
could have told him of a valuable vessel and cargo, totally 
lost upon the coast of England, last in August last, and solely 

1 It was William Gray of Salem. His letter to Pickering, making the statement 
about impressments, dated January 8, 1808, is in the Pickering Mss. 



204 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

in consequence of having had two of her men, native Amer 
icans taken from her by impressment, two months after the 
affair of the Chesapeake. 

On the 1 5th of October, the king of England issued his 
proclamation, commanding his naval officers, to impress his 
subjects from neutral vessels. This proclamation is repre 
sented as merely "requiring the return of his subjects, the 
seamen especially, from foreign countries," and then "it is 
an acknowledged principle that every nation has a right to 
the service of its subjects in time of war." Is this, sir, a 
correct statement either of the proclamation, or of the ques 
tion it involves in which our right is concerned? The king 
of England s right to the service of his subjects in time of war 
is nothing to us. The question is, whether he has a right to 
seize them forcibly on board of our vessels while under con 
tract of service to our citizens, within our jurisdiction upon 
the high seas? And whether he has a right expressly to com 
mand his naval officers so to seize them. Is this an acknowl 
edged principle? Certainly not. Why then is this proclama 
tion described as founded upon uncontested principle? and 
why is the command, so justly offensive to us, and so mis 
chievous as it might then have been made in execution, al 
together omitted? 

But it is not the taking of British subjects from our vessels, 
it is the taking under color of that pretence of our own, native 
American citizens, which constitutes the most galling ag 
gravation of this merciless practice. Yet even this, we are 
told is but a pretence for three reasons. 

1. Because the number of citizens thus taken is small. 

2. Because it arises only from the impossibility of dis 
tinguishing Englishmen from Americans. 

3. Because, such impressed American citizens are deliv 
ered up, on duly authenticated proof. 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 205 

1. Small and great in point of numbers are relative terms. 
To suppose that the native Americans form a small propor 
tion of the whole number impressed is a mistake. The re 
verse is the fact. Examine the official returns from the 
Department of State. They give the names of between four 
and five thousand men impressed since the commencement 
of the present war. Of which number, not one-fifth part were 
British subjects. The number of naturalized Americans 
could not amount to one-tenth. I hazard little in saying that 
more than three-fourths were native Americans. If it be said 
that some of these men, though appearing on the face of the 
returns American citizens, were really British subjects, and 
had fraudulently procured their protections; I reply that 
this number must be far exceeded by the cases of citizens 
impressed, which never reach the Department of State. The 
American consul in London estimates the number of impress 
ments during the war at nearly three times the amount of 
the names returned. If the nature of the offence be consid 
ered in its true colors, to a people having a just sense of per 
sonal liberty and security, it is in every single instance, of a 
malignity not inferior to that of murder. The very same 
act, when committed by the recruiting officer of one nation 
within the territories of another, is by the universal law and 
usage of nations punished with death. Suppose the crime 
had in every instance, as by its consequences it has been in 
many, deliberate murder. Would it answer or silence the 
voice of our complaints to be told that the number was 
small? 

2. The impossibility of distinguishing English from Amer 
ican seamen is not the only, nor even the most frequent oc 
casion of impressment. Look again into the returns from 
the Department of State you will see that the officers 
take our men without pretending to enquire where they were 



206 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

born; sometimes merely to show their animosity, or their 
contempt for our country; sometimes from the wantonness 
of power. When they manifest the most tender regard for the 
neutral rights of America, they lament that they want the 
men. They regret the necessity, but they must have their 
complement. When we complain of these enormities, we are 
answered that the acts of such officers were unauthorized; 
that the commanders of men-of-war are an unruly set of 
men, for whose violence their own government cannot always 
be answerable, that enquiry shall be made. A court mar 
tial is sometimes mentioned. And the issue of Whitby s l 
court martial has taught us what relief is to be expected from 
that. There are even examples I am told, when such officers 
have been put upon the yellow list. But this is a rare excep 
tion. The ordinary issue when the act is disavowed, is the 
promotion of the actor. 

3. The impressed native American citizens however, upon 
duly authenticated proof are delivered up. Indeed! how un 
reasonable then were complaint! How effectual a remedy 
for the wrong! an American vessel, bound to a European 
port, has two, three or four native Americans, impressed by 
a British man-of-war, bound to the East or West Indies. 
When the American captain arrives at his port of destina 
tion he makes his protest, and sends it to the nearest Amer 
ican minister or consul. When he returns home, he trans 
mits the duplicate of his protest to the Secretary of State. 
In process of time, the names of the impressed men, and of 
the ship into which they have been impressed, are received 
by the agent in London. He makes his demand that the 
men may be delivered up. The Lords of the Admiralty, after 
a reasonable time for enquiry and advisement, return for 
answer, that the ship is on a foreign station, and their 

1 Commander of the Leander. 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 207 

Lordships can therefore take no further steps in the matter. 
Or, that the ship has been taken, and that the men have 
been received in exchange for French prisoners. Or, that 
the men had no protections (the impressing officers often 
having taken them from the men). Or, that the men were 
probably British subjects. Or that they have entered, and 
taken the bounty; (to which the officers know how to reduce 
them). Or, that they have been married, or settled in Eng 
land. In all these cases, without further ceremony, their 
discharge is refused. Sometimes, their Lordships, in a vein 
of humor, inform the agent that the man has been discharged 
as unserviceable. Sometimes, in a sterner tone they say he 
was an impostor. Or perhaps by way of consolation to his 
relatives and friends, they report that he has fallen in battle, 
against nations in amity with his country. Sometimes they 
coolly return that there is no such man on board the ship; and 
what has become of him, the agonies of a wife and children 
in his native land may be left to conjecture. When all these 
and many other such apologies for refusal fail, the native 
American seaman is discharged and when by the chari 
table aid of his government he has found his way home, he 
comes to be informed, that all is as it should be that the 
number of his fellow-sufferers is small that it was impos 
sible to distinguish him from an Englishman and that he 
was delivered up, on duly authenticated proof. 

Enough, of this disgusting subject. I cannot stop to cal 
culate how many of these wretched victims are natives of 
Massachusetts, and how many natives of Virginia. I cannot 
stop to solve that knotty question of national jurisprudence 
whether some of them might not possibly be slaves, and there 
fore not citizens of the United States. I cannot stay to ac 
count for the wonder, why, poor, and ignorant and friendless 
as most of them are, the voice of their complaints is so seldom 



208 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

heard in the great navigating states. I admit that we have 
endured this cruel indignity, through all the administrations 
of the General Government. I acknowledge that Britain 
claims the right of seizing her subjects in our merchant ves 
sels, and that even if we could acknowledge it, the line of 
discrimination would be difficult to draw. We are not in a 
condition to maintain this right, by war; and as the British 
government have been more than once on the point of giving 
it up of their own accord, I would still hope for the day when 
returning justice shall induce them to abandon it, without 
compulsion. Her subjects we do not want. The degree of 
protection which we are bound to extend to them, cannot 
equal the claim of our own citizens. I would subscribe to any 
compromise of this contest, consistent with the rights of sov 
ereignty, the duties of humanity, and the principles of reci 
procity: but to the right of forcing even her own subjects out 
of our merchant vessels on the high seas I never can assent. 

The second point upon which Mr. Pickering defends the 
pretensions of Great Britain, is her denial to neutral nations 
of the right of prosecuting with her enemies and their col 
onies, any commerce from which they are excluded in time of 
peace. His statement of this case adopts the British doc 
trine, as sound. The right, as on the question of impress 
ment, so on this, it surrenders at discretion and it is 
equally defective in point of fact. 

In the first place, the claim of Great Britain, is not to "a 
right of imposing on this neutral commerce some limits and 
restraints" but of interdicting it altogether, at her pleasure; 
of interdicting it without a moment s notice to neutrals, after 
solemn decisions of her courts of admiralty, and formal 
acknowledgments of her ministers, that it is a lawful trade. 
And, on such a sudden, unnotified interdiction, of pouncing 
upon all neutral commerce navigating upon the faith of her 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 209 

decisions and acknowledgments, and of gorging with con 
fiscation the greediness of her cruisers. This is the right 
claimed by Britain. This is the power she has exercised. 
What Mr. Pickering calls "limits and restraints/ she calls 
relaxations of her right. 

It is but little more than two years, since this question 
was agitated both in England and America, with as much 
zeal, energy and ability, as ever was displayed upon any ques 
tion of national law. The British side was supported by Sir 
William Scott, Mr. Ward, 1 and the author of War in Dis 
guise. 2 But even in Britain their doctrine was refuted to 
demonstration by the Edinburg reviewers. In America, the 
rights of our country were maintained by numerous writers 
profoundly skilled in the science of national and maritime 
law. The Answer to War in Disguise was ascribed to a 
gentleman 3 whose talents are universally acknowledged, 
and who by his official situations had been required thor 
oughly to investigate every question of conflict between 
neutral and belligerent rights which has occurred in the 
history of modern war. Mr. Gore and Mr. Pinkney, our 
two commissioners at London, under Mr. Jay s treaty, the 
former, in a train of cool and conclusive argument addressed 
to Mr. Madison, the latter in a memorial of splendid elo 
quence from the merchants of Baltimore, supported the 
same cause; memorials, drawn by lawyers of distinguished 
eminence, by merchants of the highest character, and by 
statesmen of long experience in our national councils from 
Salem, from Boston, from New Haven, from New York, 
and from Philadelphia, together with remonstrances to the 
same effect from Newburyport, Newport, Norfolk and

Charleston. This accumulated mass of legal learning, of 
commercial information and of national sentiment from al 
most every inhabited spot upon our shores, and from one 
extremity of the Union to the other, confirmed by the un 
answered and unanswerable memorial of Mr. Monroe to the 
British minister, 1 and by the elaborate research and irre 
sistible reasoning of the examination of the British doctrine, 
was also made a subject of full, and deliberate discussion in 
the Senate of the United States. A committee of seven mem 
bers of that body, after three weeks of arduous investigation, 
reported three resolutions, the first of which was in these 
words: "Resolved, that the capture and condemnation, under 
the orders of the British government, and adjudications of 
their courts of admiralty of American vessels and their 
cargoes, on the pretext of their being employed in a trade 
with the enemies of Great Britain, prohibited in time of 
peace, is an unprovoked aggression upon the property of the 
citizens of these United States, a violation of their neutral 
rights, and an encroachment upon their national independ 



ence: 



On the 1 3th of February, 1806, the question upon the 
adoption of this resolution, was taken in the Senate. The 
yeas and nays were required; but not a solitary nay was heard 
in answer. It was adopted by the unanimous voice of all the 
senators present. They were twenty-eight in number, and 
among them stands recorded the name of Mr. Pickering. 

Let us remember that this was a question most peculiarly 
and immediately of commercial, and not agricultural interest; 
that it arose from a call, loud, energetic and unanimous from 
all the merchants of the United States upon Congress, for 

1 September 23, 1805. Printed in American State Papers, Foreign Relations, II.

i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 211 

the national interposition; that many of the memorials in 
voked all the energy of the legislature, and pledged the lives 
and properties of the memorialists in support of any measures 
which Congress might deem necessary to vindicate those 
rights. Negotiation was particularly recommended from 
Boston, and elsewhere negotiation was adopted negotia 
tion has failed and now Mr. Pickering tells us that Great 
Britain has claimed and maintained her right! He argues 
that her claim is just and is not sparing of censure upon 
those who still consider it as a serious cause of complaint. 
But there was one point of view in which the British doc 
trine on this question was then only considered incidentally 
in the United States because it was not deemed material 
for the discussion of our rights. We examined it chiefly as 
affecting the principles as between a belligerent and a neutral 
power. But in fact it was an infringement of the rights of 
war, as well as of the rights of peace. It was an unjustifiable 
enlargement of the sphere of hostile operations. The enemies 
of Great Britain had by the universal law of nations a right 
to the benefits of neutral commerce within their dominions 
(subject to the exceptions of actual blockade and contraband) 
as well as neutral nations had a right to trade with them. 
The exclusion from that commerce by this new principle of 
warfare which Britain, in defiance of all immemorial national 
usages, undertook by her single authority to establish, but 
too naturally led her enemies to resort to new and extraor 
dinary principles, by which in their turn they might re 
taliate this injury upon her. The pretence upon which 
Britain in the first instance had attempted to color her in 
justice, was a miserable fiction. It was an argument against 
fact. Her reasoning was, that a neutral vessel by mere ad 
mission in time of war, into ports from which it would have 
been excluded in time of peace, became thereby deprived of 



212 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

its national character, and ipso facto was transformed into 
enemy s property. 

Such was the basis upon which arose the far famed rule of 
the war of 1756. Such was the foundation upon which 
Britain claimed and maintained this supposed right of adding 
that new instrument of desolation to the horrors of war. It 
was distressing to her enemy. Yes! Had she adopted the 
practice of dealing with them in poison; had Mr. Fox ac 
cepted the services of the man who offered to rid him of the 
French Emperor by assassination, and had the attempt suc 
ceeded, it would have been less distressing to France than 
this rule of the war of 1756; and not more unjustifiable. 
Mr. Fox had too fair a mind for either, but his compre 
hensive and liberal spirit was discarded, with the cabinet 
which he had formed. 

It has been the struggle of reason and humanity, and above 
all the Christianity for two thousand years to mitigate the 
rigors of that scourge of human kind, war. It is now the 
struggle of Britain to aggravate them. Her rule of the war of 
1756, in itself and in its effects, was one of the deadliest 
poisons, in which it was possible for her to tinge the weapons 
of her hostility. 

In itself and in its effects, I say. For the French decrees of 
Berlin and of Milan, the Spanish and Dutch decrees of the 
same or the like tenor, and her own orders of January and 
November these alternations of licensed pillage, this eager 
competition between her and her enemies for the honor of 
giving the last stroke to the vitals of maritime neutrality, all 
are justly attributable to her assumption and exercise of this 
single principle. The rule of war of 1756 was the root, from 
which all the rest but suckers, still at every shoot growing 
ranker in luxuriance. 

In the last decrees of France and Spain, her own ingenious 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 213 

fiction is adopted; and under them, every neutral vessel 
that submits to English search, has been carried into an 
English port, or paid a tax to the English government, is de 
clared denationalized, that is to have lost her national char 
acter, and to have become English property. This is cruel in 
execution; absurd in argument. To refute it were folly, for 
to the understanding of a child it refutes itself. But it is 
the reasoning of British jurists. It is the simple application 
to the circumstances and powers of France, of the rule of the 
war of 1756. 

I am not the apologist of France and Spain; I have no 
national partialities; no national attachments but to my 
own country. I shall never undertake to justify or to palliate 
the insults or injuries of any foreign power to that country 
which is dearer to me than life. If the voice of reason and of 
justice could be heard by France and Spain, they would 
say, you have done wrong to make the injustice of your 
enemy towards neutrals the measure of your own. If she 
chastises with whips do not you chastise with scorpions. 
Whether France would listen to this language, I know not. 
The most enormous infractions of our rights hitherto com 
mitted by her, have been more in menace than in accom 
plishment. The alarm has been justly great; the anticipa 
tion threatening; but the amount of actual injury small. 
But to Britain, what can we say? If we attempt to raise our 
voices, her minister has declared to Mr. Pinkney that she 
will not hear. The only reason she assigns for her recent 
Orders of Council is, that France proceeds on the same prin 
ciples. It is not by the light of blazing temples, and amid 
the groans of women and children perishing in the ruins of 
the sanctuaries of domestic habitation at Copenhagen, that 
we can expect our remonstrances against this course of pro 
ceeding will be heard. 



2i 4 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

Let us come to the third and last of the causes of com 
plaint, which are represented as so frivolous and so un 
founded - "the unfortunate affair of the Chesapeake" The 
orders of Admiral Berkeley, under which this outrage was 
committed, have been disavowed by his government. Gen 
eral professions of a willingness to make reparation for it, 
have been lavished in profusion; and we are now instructed 
to take these professions for endeavors; to believe them sin 
cere, because his Britannic Majesty sent us a special envoy; 
and to cast the odium of defeating these endeavors upon our 
own government. 

I have already told you, that I am not one of those who 
deem suspicion and distrust, in the highest order of political 
virtues. Baseless suspicion is, in my estimation, a vice, as 
pernicious in the management of public affairs, as it is fatal 
to the happiness of domestic life. When, therefore, the 
British ministers have declared their disposition to make 
ample reparation for an injury of a most atrocious character, 
committed by an officer of high rank, and, as they say, ut 
terly without authority, I should most readily believe them, 
were their professions not positively contradicted by facts 
of more powerful eloquence than words. 

Have such facts occurred? I will not again allude to the 
circumstances of Mr. Rose s departure upon his mission at 
such a precise point of time, that his commission and the 
Orders of Council of nth November, might have been 
signed with the same penful of ink. The subjects were not 
immediately connected with each other, and his Majesty 
did not chuse to associate distinct topics of negotiation. 
The attack upon the Chesapeake was disavowed; and ample 
reparation was withheld only, because with the demand for 
satisfaction upon that injury, the American government had 
coupled a demand for the cessation of others; alike in kind, 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 215 

but of minor aggravation. But had reparation really been 
intended, would it not have been offered, not in vague and 
general terms, but in precise and specific proposals? Were 
any such made? None. But it is said Mr. Monroe was re 
stricted from negotiating upon this subject apart; and there 
fore Mr. Rose was to be sent to Washington; charged with 
this single object; and without authority to treat upon or 
even to discuss any other. Mr. Rose arrives. The Amer 
ican government readily determine to treat upon the Chesa 
peake affair, separately from all others; but before Mr. Rose 
sets his foot on shore, in pursuance of a pretension made be 
fore by Mr. Canning, he connects with the negotiation, a sub 
ject far more distinct from the butchery of the Chesapeake, 
than the general impressment of our seamen, I mean the 
proclamation, interdicting to British ships of war, the en 
trance of our harbors. 

The great obstacle which has always interfered in the ad 
justment of our differences with Britain, has been that she 
would not acquiesce in the only principle upon which fair 
negotiation between independent nations can be conducted, 
the principle of reciprocity, that she refuses the application 
to us of the claim which she asserts for herself. The forcible 
taking of men from an American vessel, was an essential 
part of the outrage upon the Chesapeake. It was the osten 
sible purpose for which that act of war unproclaimed, was 
committed. The President s proclamation was a subsequent 
act, and was avowedly founded upon many similar aggres 
sions, of which that was only the most aggravated. 

If then Britain could with any color of reason claim that 
the general question of impressment should be laid out of the 
case altogether, she ought upon the principle of reciprocity 
to have laid equally out of the case, the proclamation, a 
measure so easily separable from it, and in its nature merely 



216 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

defensive. When therefore she made the repeal of the 
proclamation an indispensable preliminary to all discussion 
upon the nature and extent of that reparation which she 
had offered, she refused to treat with us upon the footing of 
an independent power. She insisted upon an act of self- 
degradation on our part, before she would even tell us, what 
redress she would condescend to grant for a great and 
acknowledged wrong. This was a condition which she could 
not but know to be inadmissible, and is of itself proof nearly 
conclusive that her cabinet never intended to make for that 
wrong any reparation at all. 

But this is not all. It cannot be forgotten that when that 
atrocious deed was committed, amidst the general burst of 
indignation which resounded from every part of this Union, 
there were among us a small number of persons, who upon 
the opinion that Berkeley s orders were authorized by his 
government, undertook to justify them in their fullest ex 
tent. These ideas probably first propagated by British 
official characters, in this country, were persisted in until the 
disavowal of the British government took away the necessity 
for persevering in them, and gave notice where the next 
position was to be taken. This patriotic reasoning however 
had been so satisfactory at Halifax, that complimentary 
letters were received from Admiral Berkeley himself highly 
approving the spirit in which they were inculcated, and re 
marking how easily peace, between the United States and 
Britain might be preserved, if that measure of our national 
rights could be made the prevailing standard of the country. 

When the news arrived in England, although the general 
sentiment of the nation was not prepared for the formal 
avowal and justification of this unparalleled aggression, yet 
there were not wanting persons there, ready to claim and 
maintain the right of searching national ships for deserters. 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 217 

It was said at the time, but for this we must of course rest 
upon the credit of inofficial authority, to have been made a 
serious question in the Cabinet Council; nor was its deter 
mination there ascribed to the eloquence of the gentleman 
who became the official organ of its communication. Add to 
this a circumstance, which without claiming irrefragable 
credence of a diplomatic note, has yet its weight upon the 
common sense of mankind; that in all the daily newspapers 
known to be in the ministerial interest, Berkeley was justi 
fied and applauded in every variety of form that publication 
could assume, excepting only that of official proclamation. 
The only part of his orders there disapproved was the re 
ciprocal offer which he made of submitting his own ships to 
be searched in return that was very unequivocally dis 
claimed. The ruffian right of superior force, was the solid 
base upon which the claim was asserted, and so familiar was 
this argument grown to the casuists of British national juris 
prudence, that the right of a British man-of-war to search an 
American frigate, was to them a self-evident proof against 
the right of the American frigate to search the British man-of- 
war. The same tone has been constantly kept up, until our 
accounts of latest date; and have been recently further in 
vigorated by a very explicit call for war with the United 
States, which they contend could be of no possible injury to 
Britain, and which they urge upon the ministry as affording 
them an excellent opportunity to accomplish a dismember 
ment of this Union. These sentiments have even been 
avowed in Parliament, where the nobleman who moved the 
address of the house of Lords in answer to the king s speech, 
declared that the right of searching national ships, ought to 
be maintained against the Americans, and disclaimed only 
with respect to European sovereigns. 

In the meantime Admiral Berkeley, by a court martial of 



2i 8 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

his own subordinate officers, hung one of the men taken from 
the Chesapeake, and called his name Jenkin Ratford. There 
was, according to the answer so frequently given by the Lords 
of the Admiralty, upon applications for the discharge of im 
pressed Americans, no such man on board the ship. The man 
thus executed had been taken from the Chesapeake by the 
name of Wilson. It is said that on his trial he was identified 
by one or two witnesses who knew him, and that before he 
was turned off he confessed his name to be Ratford and that 
he was born in England. But it has also been said that Rat- 
ford is now living in Pennsylvania; and after the character 
which the disavowal of Admiral Berkeley s own government 
has given to his conduct, what confidence can be claimed or 
due to the proceedings of a court martial of his associates held 
to sanction his proceedings. The three other men had not 
even been demanded in his orders. They were taken by the 
sole authority of the British searching lieutenant, after the 
surrender of the Chesapeake. There was not the shadow of a 
pretence before the court martial that they were British 
subjects, or born in any of the British dominions. Yet by 
this court martial they were sentenced to suffer death. They 
were reprieved from execution, only upon condition of re 
nouncing their rights as Americans by voluntary service in 
the king s ships. They have never been restored. To com 
plete the catastrophe with which this bloody tragedy was 
concluded, Admiral Berkeley himself in sanctioning the 
doom of these men, thus obtained, thus tried, and thus 
sentenced, read them a grave moral lecture on the enormity 
of their crime, in its tendency to provoke a war between the 
United States and Great Britain. 

Yet amidst all this parade of disavowal by his govern 
ment amidst all these professions of readiness to make 
reparation, not a single mark of the slightest disapprobation 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 219 

appears ever to have been manifested to that officer. His 
instructions were executed upon the Chesapeake in June. 
Rumors of his recall have been circulated here. But on 
leaving the station at Halifax in December, he received a 
complimentary address from the colonial assembly, and 
assured them in answer, that he had no official information of 
his recall. From thence he went to the West Indies; and on 
leaving Bermuda for England in February was addressed 
again by that colonial government, in terms of high panegyric 
upon his energy, with manifest allusion to his achievement 
upon the Chesapeake. 

Under all these circumstances, without applying any of 
the maxims of a suspicious policy to the British professions, 
I may still be permitted to believe that their ministry never 
seriously intended to make us honorable reparation, or in 
deed any reparation at all for that "unfortunate affair." 

It is impossible for any man to form an accurate idea of 
the British policy towards the United States, without taking 
into consideration the state of parties in that government, 
and the views, characters and opinions of the individuals at 
their helm of state. A liberal and a hostile policy towards 
America, are among the strongest marks of distinction be 
tween the political systems of the rival statesmen of that 
kingdom. The liberal party are reconciled to our independ 
ence; and though extremely tenacious of every right of their 
own country, are systematically disposed to preserve peace 
with the United States. Their opponents harbor sentiments 
of a very different description. Their system is coercion. 
Their object the recovery of their lost dominion in North 
America. This party now stands high in power. Although 
Admiral Berkeley may never have received written orders 
from them for his enterprise upon the Chesapeake, yet in 
giving his instructions to the squadron at Norfolk, he knew 



220 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

full well under what administration he was acting. Every 
measure of. that administration towards us since that time 
has been directed to the same purpose to break down the 
spirit of our national independence. Their purpose, as far 
as it can be collected from their acts, is to force us into war 
with them or with their enemies; to leave us only the bitter 
alternative of their vengeance or their protection. 

Both these parties are no doubt willing, that we should 
join them in the war of their nation against France and her 
allies. The late administration would have drawn us into 
it by treaty, the present are attempting it by compulsion. 
The former would have admitted us as allies, the latter will 
have us no otherwise than as colonists. On the late debates 
in Parliament, the Lord Chancellor freely avowed that the 
Orders of Council of nth November were intended to make 
America at last sensible of the policy of joining England 
against France. 

This too, sir, is the substantial argument of Mr. Pickering s 
letter. The suspicions of a design in our own administration 
to plunge us into a war with Britain, I never have shared. 
Our administration have every interest and every motive 
that can influence the conduct of man to deter them from 
any such purpose. Nor have I seen anything in their meas 
ures bearing the slightest indication of it. But between a 
design of war with England, and a surrender of our national 
freedom for the sake of war with the rest of Europe, there is 
a material difference. This is the policy now in substance 
recommended to us, and for which the interposition of the 
commercial States is called. For this, not only are all the 
outrages of Britain to be forgotten, but the very assertion 
of our rights is to be branded with odium. Impressment. 
Neutral trade. British taxation. Everything that can dis 
tinguish a state of national freedom from a state of national 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 221 

vassalage, is to be surrendered at discretion. In the face of 
every fact we are told to believe every profession. In the 
midst of every indignity, we are pointed to British protection 
as our only shield against the universal conqueror. Every 
phantom of jealousy and fear is evoked. The image of 
France with a scourge in her hand is impressed into the 
service, to lash us into the refuge of obedience to Britain. 
Insinuations are even made that if Britain "with her thou 
sand ships of war," has not destroyed our commerce, it has 
been owing to her indulgence, and we are almost threatened 
in her name with the "destruction of our fairest cities." 

Not one act of hostility to Britain has been committed by 
us, she has not a pretence of that kind to allege. But if she 
will wage war upon us, are we to do nothing in our own de 
fence? If she issues orders of universal plunder upon our 
commerce, are we not to withhold it from her grasp? Is 
American pillage one of those rights which she has claimed 
and exercised until we are foreclosed from any attempt to 
obstruct its collection? For what purpose are we required 
to make this sacrifice of every thing that can give value to the 
name of freemen, this abandonment of the very right of self- 
preservation? Is it to avoid a war? Alas! Sir, it does not 
offer even this plausible plea for pusillanimity. For, as sub 
mission would make us to all substantial purposes British 
colonies, her enemies would unquestionably treat us as such, 
and after degrading ourselves into voluntary servitude to 
escape a war with her, we should incur inevitable war with all 
her enemies, and be doomed to share the destinies of her 
conflict with a world in arms. 

Between this unqualified submission, and offensive re 
sistance against the war upon maritime neutrality waged 
by the concurring decrees of all the great belligerent powers, 
the embargo was adopted, and has been hitherto continued. 



222 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

So far was it from being dictated by France, that it was cal 
culated to withdraw, and has withdrawn from within her 
reach all the means of compulsion which her subsequent 
decrees would have put in her possession. It has added to 
the motives both of France and England, for preserving 
peace with us, and has diminished their inducements to 
war. It has lessened their capacities of inflicting injury upon 
us, and given us some preparation for resistance to them. It 
has taken from their violence the lure of interest. It has 
dashed the philter of pillage from the lips of rapine. That 
it is distressing to ourselves that it calls for the fortitude 
of a people, determined to maintain their rights, is not to be 
denied. But the only alternative was between that and Avar, 
Whether it will yet save us from that calamity, cannot be 
determined, but if not, it will prepare us for the further 
struggle to which we may be called. Its double tendency of 
promoting peace and preparing for war, in its operation upon 
both the belligerent rivals, is the great advantage, which 
more than outweighs all its evils. 

If any statesman can point out another alternative, I am 
ready to hear him, and for any practicable expedient to lend 
him every possible assistance. But let not that expedient 
be, submission to trade under British licenses, and British 
taxation. We are told that even under these restrictions we 
may yet trade to the British dominions, to Africa and China, 
and with the colonies of France, Spain, and Holland. I ask 
not, how much of this trade would be left, when our inter 
course with the whole continent of Europe being cut off would 
leave us no means of purchase, and no market for sale? I 
ask not, what trade we could enjoy with the colonies of na 
tions with which we should be at war? I ask not, how long 
Britain would leave open to us avenues of trade, which even 
in these very orders of Council, she boasts of leaving open as 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 223 

a special indulgence? If we yield the principle, we abandon 
all pretence to national sovereignty. To yearn for the frag 
ments of trade which might be left, would be to pine for the 
crumbs of commercial servitude. The boon, which we should 
humiliate ourselves to accept from British bounty, would 
soon be withdrawn. Submission never yet set boundaries to 
encroachment. From pleading for half the empire, we should 
sink into supplicants for life. We should supplicate in vain. 
If we must fall, let us fall, freemen. If we must perish, let 
it be in defence of our RIGHTS. 

To conclude, sir, I am not sensible of any necessity for 
the extraordinary interference of the commercial States, to 
control the general councils of the nation. If any inter 
ference could at this critical extremity of our affairs have a 
kindly effect upon our common welfare, it would be an inter 
ference to promote union and not a division to urge mu 
tual confidence, and not universal distrust to strengthen 
the arm and not to relax the sinews of the nation. Our 
suffering and our dangers, though differing perhaps in degree, 
are universal in extent. As their causes are justly chargeable, 
so their removal is dependent not upon ourselves, but upon 
others. But while the spirit of independence shall continue 
to beat in unison with the pulses of the nation, no danger will 
be truly formidable. Our duties are, to prepare with con 
certed energy, for those which threaten us, to meet them 
without dismay, and to rely for their issue upon heaven.

1 A series of articles in reply to this letter appeared in The Repertory, beginning 
April 22. In the New York Evening Post, William Coleman attacked the letter and 
its author in scathing terms, and some in Boston reprinted the articles, with others 
from other sources, in a pamphlet: Remarks and Criticisms on the Hon. John Quincy 
Adams s Letter to the Hon. Harrison Gray Otis, Boston, 1808. The preface to this 
pamphlet contained the following sentences: "It is left to literary men to decide

APPENDIX 1 

July 27, 1824. 

On the 1 8th of December, 1807, Mr. Jefferson sent a confidential 
message to both houses of Congress, recommending an immediate 
embargo; and enclosing two documents, one of which was a recent 
proclamation of the king of Great Britain, authorizing and com 
manding the impressment by his naval officers, of British seamen 
from neutral merchant vessels, and the other a correspondence 
between General Armstrong, then our minister in France, and 
the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Champagny, showing that 
the Emperor Napoleon had finally determined to carry into full 
execution, without regard to the treaty between the United States 
and France, his Berlin decree of 2ist November, 1806, which had 
for some months after it was issued, been suspended with regard 
to the vessels of the United States. 

The attack by a British squadron upon our frigate Chesapeake, 

cians, whether he has not disappointed them as a statesman. If he has been flat 
tered, admired and trusted beyond his merit, it has been his misfortune; and if all 
is now left that justly belongs to him, he cannot complain." The language employed 
by some called out rebukes even from their own following. For example, of "Al 
fred s" Letter to J. Q. Adams, the federalist Repertory said, the writer had "indulged 
in a strain of such bitter invective, and manifested such a disposition to belittle the 
object of his reprehension, that we can say with confidence, the most decided among 
federalists will not subscribe to this mode of attack. It will be to them a cause of 
regret, and to the repudiated senator a source of satisfaction." June 21, 1808. A 
writer "Marcellus" in the Independent Chronicle, March 17, reviewed Pickering s 
letter, and in a reissue of this article a brief introductory paragraph said: "The style 
and principles of the writer strongly mark it as the production of the independent 
and patriotic John Quincy Adams, Esq., one of our Senators in Congress." There 
is, however, no evidence that Adams had any share in the "Marcellus" contribu 
tions, of which this particular article was No. 25. A long list of the replies, endorse 
ments, criticisms and reviews called out by this letter could be compiled, but 
would be of little interest. 

1 In the summer of 1824, a publisher in Baltimore, Maryland, proposed to reissue 
the Letter to Mr. Otis, and this was done after Adams had contributed this "Ap 
pendix." It was printed at the office of the Baltimore Patriot. 



1824] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 225 

had very recently occurred, in consequence of which all British 
armed vessels had been interdicted from entering the ports of the 
United States. The British Orders in Council of nth November, 
1807, professedly retaliatory upon the French decree of Berlin, 
had issued and were already announced in the newspapers of the 
United States, though not yet officially authenticated. The gen 
eral state of our commercial affairs was momentous and full of 
alarm. The British government had disavowed the attack upon 
the Chesapeake, but instead of giving immediate satisfaction for it, 
had appointed Mr. Rose to come out upon a mission of subterfuge 
and prevarication concerning it, and at the same moment had issued 
without notification either to the government of the United States, 
or to their minister in London, the Orders in Council, which but 
for the embargo, would, while Mr. Rose was amusing us with the 
fragrance of his diplomacy, have swept three-fourths of the ton 
nage of the United States into the ports of Great Britain for con 
fiscation. 

It was in this state of things that the message recommending 
the embargo was received and discussed, in secret session, by the 
Senate. The only motive for debating it with closed doors was 
the necessity, if the measure recommended was deemed proper, of 
adopting it immediately. Every hour of debate tended to defeat 
the object of the message. For the instant it should be known in 
the commercial cities that an embargo was impending, the spirit of 
desperate adventure would have rushed to sea, with every plank 
that could have been made to float; and the delay of a week in 
deliberation, instead of sheltering the property of our merchants 
from depredation, would only have cast it forth upon the waters 
to be intercepted by the cruisers of both the combating nations. 

The message was referred, in Senate, to a committee of five, of 
which General Samuel Smith, himself an eminent merchant, 
brother to the Secretary of the Navy, and in the full confidence of 
Mr. Jefferson, was chairman, and of which I was a member. The 
chairman proposed to the committee, to report a bill in compliance 
with the recommendation of the message. I objected that the 



226 THE WRITINGS OF [1824 

two documents with the message were not sufficient to justify so 
strong and severe a measure as an embargo; and enquired, whether 
besides the general notoriety of the dangers, mentioned in the 
message, the executive had other reasons for the measure, which it 
might not be convenient to assign. The chairman said, it was ex 
pected and hoped that the act would have a favorable effect, to 
aid the executive in the negotiation with Mr. Rose; and also that 
it was intended as a substitution for the non-importation act, 
which had passed on the i8th of April, 1806, but pending the nego 
tiations had been suspended until the I4th of December, 1807, only 
four days before the message. This act was itself nearly equivalent 
to a total commercial non-intercourse with Great Britain; and to 
have repealed, or longer suspended it at that time, would have been 
a surrender at discretion, upon all the subjects of controversy, 
then in so high a state of aggravation, with that power. To these 
reasons I yielded, and the bill for laying the embargo was reported 
to the Senate with the unanimous consent of the committee. 

The bill was opposed in the Senate, very feebly upon its merits, 
and exclusively by the federal members, then only four in number. 
The principal effort made by them was to obtain delay, which 
would, as has been shown, have defeated in a great measure the ob 
ject of the bill. They obtained against the bill only the vote of 
Mr. Maclay of Pennsylvania, and of Mr. Crawford, then a new 
member, but who afterwards constantly supported the adherence 
of the administration to the act, as long as it was continued. 

In assigning to the Senate very briefly my reasons for assenting 
to the bill, and for the belief that it ought to pass without delay, I 
admitted that the two documents transmitted with the message, 
would not have been of themselves, to my mind, sufficient to war 
rant the measure recommended in it; but referring to the existing 
state of things, of public notoriety, and denominated in the message 
"the present crisis," I observed that the executive, having recom 
mended the measure upon his responsibility, had doubtless other 
reasons for it which I was persuaded were satisfactory; that with 
this view, convinced of the expediency of the bill, I was also im- 



i82 4 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 227 

pressed with the necessity of its immediate adoption; that it was 
a time, not for deliberation but for action; and that I wished the 
bill, instead of lingering through the dilatory process of ordinary 
legislation, might pass through all the stages of its enactment in a 
single day. With these views a decided majority of the Senate con 
curred. The rule which required that bills should be read three 
times on three different days, was suspended; all motions of post 
ponement were discarded, and the bill was passed in the Senate by 
a vote of twenty-two to six. 

My allusion to the recommendation of the executive upon his 
responsibility and to my confidence in it, was purposely made in 
general terms; but it had reference to the reasons which had been 
assigned to me in the committee, by the chairman. I deemed it 
less necessary to specify them, because as I have observed, the 
opposition to the bill upon its merits was exceedingly feeble; 
scarcely calling for an answer. 

About two months after the embargo had been enacted, and 
while it was bearing with severe pressure upon the commercial, 
navigating and fishing interests of the north, Mr. Pickering wrote a 
letter to the governor of Massachusetts, for communication to the 
legislature, denouncing the executive and Congress of the United 
States, for passing the embargo; and calling for the interposition 
of the commercial states to save the country from ruin. The gov 
ernor sent it back to him, with a letter of rebuke for expecting 
him to make such a communication to the legislature. 1 Mr. Pick 
ering, apprehensive, as he says, that he should not obtain his ob 
ject through the governor, sent a copy to his excellent friend, 
George Cabot, (since President of the Hartford Convention,) who 
after waiting a few days, finding that the original was not com 
municated to the legislature, sent a copy to the printer. 

The governor of Massachusetts, in his answer to Mr. Pickering, 
had stated that my opinion had been and still was in favor of the 
embargo. Mr. Pickering replied, and in terms supplied by his 

1 Interesting Correspondence between his Excellency Governour Sullivan and Col. 
Pickering, Boston, 1808. 



228 THE WRITINGS OF [1824 

feelings at the time, charged me with having in the debate on the 
embargo, expressed a sentiment which resolved the whole business 
of legislation into the will of the executive. To support the charge, 
he quoted several words, which he said I had used in the debate, 
and which detached from this context, and from the explanation I 
have now given, might deserve all the severity of his commentary. 1 

1 "In opposing a postponement, to obtain further information, and to consider a 
measure of such moment, of such universal concern, Adams made this declaration: 
The President has recommended the measure on his high responsibility: I would 
not consider I would not deliberate: I would act. Doubtless the President pos 
sesses such further information as will justify the measure ! " Pickering to Sullivan, 
April 22, 1808; he repeated it in his Address to the People of the United States 
(No. XIV), printed in the Salem Gazette, and in pamphlet; and again in his Review 
of the Adams-Cunningham correspondence, adding, "This sentiment was so ex 
traordinary, that I instantly wrote it down." 

In the Adams Mss. is an undated draught of a letter to the Editors of the New 
England Palladium: "You are requested to state to the public that Mr. John 
Quincy Adams never said in the Senate of the United States that he would not 
deliberate. He confidently believes that he never used the words. He is certain 
that if he did use them, it was in connection with others which gave them a mean 
ing entirely different from that which has been imputed to him. The sentiments 
which he did express were these: 

"That the general accounts from France and England proved that the commerce 
and seamen of the United States were threatened with the most imminent dangers. 
That besides the official documents sent with the President s message recommend 
ing the embargo, that officer might perhaps have received information which could 
not be communicated to Congress, but which might concur with the official papers 
in producing the recommendation in the message. That under those circumstances, 
whatever doubts might have remained upon his mind, on considering only those two 
papers, he could not allow them to weigh against the express recommendation of the 
first magistrate, upon his high responsibility to the nation. That he could not 
justify it to himself or his country, if in such a state of things he should refuse his 
assent to the measure thus required. That having come to this conclusion, he was 
against postponing the final decision of the question in Senate to another day. For if 
another day should be consumed in discussing the question in Senate, it being then 
Friday, the bill could not go to the House of Representatives until the next week. 
That as a measure of restriction, the embargo, if adopted, ought to be made to 
operate as equally as possible throughout the Union; but that if many days were 
spent in the discussion, individuals in the neighboring ports of Baltimore, Phila 
delphia and New York, would obtain information of its object, which, not being 



i82 4 ] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 229 

In the same letter Mr. Pickering explicitly admitted that I had 
never given him the slightest cause of offence, and that in five years 
of service together as senators from the same State, "though often 
opposed in opinion, on national measures, there had never existed 
for a moment any personal difference between us." I notice now 
this admission, merely to mark the period and the manner in which 
this mutual respect and forbearance between us ceased, and to 
whom it was justly imputable. 

On my part it did not cease even then. It was impossible to 
have framed a charge more destitute of foundation; more easily 
refuted; or more open to the chastisement of severe retaliation. 
Yet I took no public notice of it; nor shall I now go further beyond 
the simple declaration that I never expressed or felt the sentiment 
imputed to me by Mr. Pickering, than to observe, that if I uttered 
it, and had been understood in the sense which he has given to my 
words, it was his duty, and the duty of every senator present, who 
so understood me, not only to have had my words taken down at 
the time, but instantly to have called me to order for using them. 

The words as Mr. Pickering professes to have understood them, 
were undoubtedly in the highest degree disorderly and a decisive 
proof that they were not generally so understood is found in the 
circumstance that no exception was taken to them at the time. 

generally public, would give them undue advantages over their fellow citizens, 
especially those of the remoter ports. 

"For these sentiments, and for his votes in favor of the embargo, he is willing to 
abide by the judgment of his country, of the world, and of posterity. The expres 
sion of subserviency to the recommendation of the President, and the refusal to 
deliberate, which have been imputed to him, he explicitly denies." 

Rev. David Osgood delivered the annual election sermon in 1810. Many reflec 
tions made in it seem to refer to Adams political course, and this directly applied 
to him: " I would not deliberate, exclaims the infatuated senator: and so, laws are 
at once enacted whose execution brings distress upon thousands, arrests a com 
merce said to be the second in the world, and turns the naval and military force of 
the country against the industry and peace of its inhabitants; laws, which, in a 
free republic, outrage all the principles of freedom, trample upon the most essential 
rights of man, and dissolve the bonds of the social compact." The sermon was 
printed by the Commonwealth. 



2 3 o THE WRITINGS OF [1824 

It is a rule of the Senate and of all equitable deliberative assem 
blies, that exceptionable words shall not only be taken down at 
the time when spoken, but that he who speaks them shall imme 
diately be called to account for, to retract, or to explain them. Had 
this rule been observed by Mr. Pickering, when called upon to 
explain what I meant by reference to the recommendation of the 
executive, upon his responsibility, and to the other reasons, which he 
might have, and which I had no doubt were satisfactory, I should 
have had the opportunity of giving the explanation herein con 
tained, and of showing that my words imported no sentiment even 
of improper deference for the opinions or wishes of the executive. 
But it is also a breach of order, to refer by way of censure, at one 
time, to words spoken at another; and a rule equally just that no 
member shall be called to account in any other place, for words 
spoken in the Senate. These rules are founded upon principles 
which every man of a fair and honorable mind feels himself bound 
to observe; and they apply with peculiar force to a debate with 
closed doors, which is in its nature secret and confidential. 

The error of Mr. Pickering s charge consists in his connecting 
my expression of confidence in the recommendation of the ex 
ecutive, which I assigned as one of my reasons for agreeing to the 
act, with my argument for the necessity of despatch, which was 
founded in the nature of the act itself, and the portentous crisis 
of the times. 

The reference to the recommendation of the executive was made 
in answer to the objection that the documents sent with the mes 
sage did not justify the measure recommended in it. Knowing that 
there were other reasons, and referring to them for the justification 
of my own vote, both in committee and in the Senate, in favor of 
the bill, nothing could have been farther from my thoughts, as 
nothing would have been more in conflict with the whole tenor of 
my conduct through five years of active service as a member of 
the Senate, than the utterance of a sentiment of subserviency to 
the will, or even to the wishes of the executive. 

The confidence in the executive which I avowed, was applicable 



i82 4 J JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 231 

to the particular circumstances of the time, and to the particular 
subject in discussion. Nor was that confidence misplaced. In the 
House of Representatives the embargo message was debated three 
days on the merits but after the three days the House came to 
the same conclusion at which the Senate had arrived in four hours. 
It was a wise, a provident, and, above all, a purely patriotic meas 
ure. The share that I had in it, and the part that I took in pro 
moting it, remains among the transactions of my public life to 
which my memory recurs with the most gratifying recollections. 
Many other events have been less trying to the fortitude of ad 
versity, and more favored by the vicissitudes of fortune; but on 
no occasion has the consciousness of upright intentions, and a spirit 
independent alike of obsequiousness to executive will, and of fac 
tious opposition borne me with more firm and even step through 
the temporary furnace of affliction, and sustained me under the 
abandonment of friends, the alienation of popular favor at home, 
and all the obloquy that Mr. Pickering and his co-adjutors have 
from that day to this been able to conjure upon my head. 

Between the system of policy, of which the embargo was a prom 
inent measure, and that of which Mr. Pickering and his friend the 
president of the Hartford convention were the "pillars of state," 
the final and irrevocable sentence of time has now passed I shall 
not dwell upon it. 

If there be a lesson of political wisdom, which the people of this 
Union have had cause to learn from their own experience, as well 
as from the uniform tenor of human history, it is that of carrying 
a temper of mutual forbearance, through all their divisions; of mak 
ing the party feeling, which never can include more than a portion 
of the republic, subordinate to the civic spirit which embraces the 
whole. In the collisions of political systems, it is the duty of the 
citizen to take his stand upon deliberate conviction, and to pursue 
his principles, regardless of consequences to himself. But when the 
conflict is past, and the contest of principle is at an end, both par 
ties, and above all the prevailing party, should remember and 
practice upon the maxim of the Roman republic, that in civil dis- 



232 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

sensions, success was but a lesser evil than defeat, and that no 
honors of triumph could ever be awarded to victory. 1 



TO ABIGAIL ADAMS 

WASHINGTON, 20 April, 1808. 

As for myself, I have not indeed written you so often as 
my inclination would have dictated ; but I hope you will im 
pute it to any cause rather than to a failure in the dearest of 
my duties. Among the severest of the trials which have be 
fallen me during the present session of Congress (and they 
have been severe beyond any that I ever was before called to 
meet) that of having incurred in some particulars the disap 
probation of both my parents has been to me the most 
afflictive. Totally disconnected with all the intrigues of the 
various parties which have been in such a violent electioneer 
ing fermentation, I have been obliged to act upon principles 
exclusively my own, and without having any aid from the 
party in power have made myself the very mark of the most 
envenomed shafts from their opponents. Although I at 
tended at Mr. Bradley s caucus or convention, yet it has 
been very explicitly understood by the principal friends of 
the candidates that I had no intention to become the partisan 
of either. 2 This neutrality with regard to persons has, of

printed, calling the meeting, is in the Adams Mss., and is endorsed "personally

and thereby exposed it to criticism. I blame not your attendance nor your vote.

course, neutralized the men of both sides in return, and hav 
ing taken an active and decided part upon much of the public 
business, it has on one side been convenient to load me with 
the burthen of managing as much of it as I would assume, 
and on the other to leave me to defend myself as well as I 
could from the assailants of another quarter. Hence there 
has been scarcely a measure of great public importance but 
I have been obliged to attend to in committee as well as in 
the Senate; and in addition to all the rest a question of ex 
pulsion of a member has been imposed upon me, of great 
difficulty respecting the forms of proceeding, and the merits 
of the particular case, which I have been compelled to carry 

summon impudence enough to go to their caucus? I thought we had been sifted 
so much that what remained was never to be changed. I wish to God the noble 
house of Braintree had been put in # hole and a deep one too, twenty years ago." 
B. Gardenier to Rufus King, January 26, 1808. Life and Correspondence of Rufus 
King, V. 68. 

"Our letters say that Mr. Adams, the Massachusetts Senator, did attend the 
Madisonian caucus, summoned by Bradley; but he did not vote; nor did he take any 
active part in the approaching canvass. The late movements of this gentleman have 
excited much conversation and contemplation among his political friends; but those 
who know him best, do not hesitate to say, he is still radically right; and that 
though the high ground he has taken, like all things in extremes, may have its 
fault; it has nevertheless been warranted by a just spirit of patriotism; and a keen 
susceptibility of injuries received by our country; and that the ground he maintains 
is more truly American, than that of many of those from whom he has recently 
differed in opinion; which events, he affirms, will confirm as correct; and which 
Great Britain will yet acknowledge to be just and proper. On some topics he dis 
agrees from other leading federalists; particularly in regard to confidence in the 
administration; and the embargo. On other subjects he does not materially vary 
from his late friends. He is pointed in his condemnation of the whole affair of the 
Chesapeake; is the advocate of a bold and manly vindication of our national com 
mercial rights; and in the stipulations with Great Britain is anxious that we may 
make the best bargain we can. If this part of his policy is not more hard than 
honest; and if we do not, by adopting it, hazard much more than we have any pros 
pect of obtaining by plunging into an unnecessary and, in almost any possible 
event, a disastrous war, we still think his principles to be federal." Columbian 
Centinel, February 20, 1808. 



234 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

through almost alone. The question was taken about ten 
days since, and the vote for expulsion was nineteen to ten. 
The Constitution requiring two-thirds to carry the vote, it 
failed by a single vote. I could tell you, though it may not 
be proper to say upon paper, by what a curious concurrence 
of parties the ten votes of acquittal was compounded. 

The letter of Mr. Pickering is another document of which 
I could account for the origin from circumstances perhaps 
not known to you. I was not named in the letter, but it was 
hardly possible for me to avoid noticing it. My letter to Mr. 
Otis was written in great haste, and of course in point of 
composition is incorrect. It touches only upon the leading 
inaccuracies of his statement, because both my own want of 
time, and a regard to the public patience, made it necessary 
to be as short as possible. Yet it engrossed every leisure 
moment I could command for a fortnight. I mention these 
things by way of excuse for not having written more fre 
quently to you. 

I have had no intention or desire of influencing elections 
by what I have written. If an impartial person will consider 
the situation in which I was placed by Mr. Pickering s letter, 
I think he will perceive that something from me was indis 
pensable. The effects of my letter will, I hope, be what was 
intended to promote Union at home, and urge to vigor 
against foreign hostile powers. If federalism consists in 
looking to the British navy as the only palladium of our 
liberties, I must be a political heretic. If federalism will 
please to consist of a determination to defend our country, I 
still subscribe to its doctrines. 

My father and brother write me that my letter to Mr. Otis 
will not have much circulation. I know very well that argu 
ment for embargo will not be so catching as invective against 
it, and if my countrymen are not inclined to hear me, I must 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 235 

bear their indifference with as much fortitude and philos 
ophy as I can command. I should hope at least that in 
future, the legislature will not be taken by surprise, and 
driven to imprudent measures, by having a fire-brand thrown 
into their windows, in the midst of their session. 

We adjourn next Monday. In a fortnight from that time 
I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you, and at least at 
Quincy I shall be sure of meeting no altered faces. . . . 

Your s dutifully. 



TO GEORGE BOYD 

BOSTON, 14 May, 1808. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

I received the day before yesterday your favor of the 5th 
instant, which I should have answered immediately, but 
for a species of indisposition which has disqualified me for 
occupation of any kind. 

I can see no impropriety in your intended application to 
Mr. Madison for the appointment as a messenger to bear 
dispatches to France, and I could indulge my feelings with 
no higher gratification than that of aiding your wishes by 
my recommendation. But my situation in relation to the 
Secretary of State, as well as to every other member of the 
administration, is such as to forbid me from every the most 
distant appearance of solicitation of any favor of any de 
scription whatsoever, for myself or for any of my relatives. 
The course of my political conduct has recently been such 
as to impose upon me a prohibition of this kind, more rigor 
ous still than I should have felt, had my views of public 
affairs been at the widest variance from those of the admin 
istration. If you should incline to the opinion that this 



236 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

resolution bears the complexion of a delicacy too scrupulous, 
savoring more of indifference to the service of my friends 
than of genuine purity of principle, cast your eye over the 
animadversions in all the federal prints, and observe the 
baseness of motive which they are all so ready to find for 
every act of my life, since my opinions on objects of national 
importance have differed from those which they have thought 
proper to embrace. This sort of invective I can bear with 
proper composure so long as I know it to be utterly false. 
But if it were possible for my own mind to charge me with 
the same accusations, if by the request or even by the receipt 
of a single favor, however slight, from the administration, 
I could give occasion even for a just suspicion of the principles 
upon which I have supported their measures, I should have 
in my own bosom a chastiser more severe and more im 
placable than the most inveterate of my enemies, whether 
of the old school or of the new. 

This determination has already more than once compelled 
me to decline an interference in favor of some of my family 
connections which was desired, and which it was with much 
reluctance that I withheld. On no occasion could it possibly 
be more at war with my strongest inclinations than on that 
which deprives me of the means of rendering an acceptable 
service to you. It is I believe known both to Mr. Madison 
and to Mr. Jefferson, that I have no personal favor whatso 
ever to ask of either, and an application in behalf of any 
person connected with me would appear a departure from 
those principles to which in all consistency I ought to adhere. 1 

1 Another had suggested to Jefferson the sacrifice made by Adams. "The federal 
party in this State have obtained the government. Their principal object, at pres 
ent, appears to be the political and even the personal destruction of John Quincy 
Adams. They have yesterday come to the choice of a senator in Congress to suc 
ceed him next year. James Lloyd had 246 [248] votes, Adams, 213. It is of great 
consequence to the interest of Mr. Adams, and to that of your administration, to 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 237 

The state of our politics under the new legislature is not 
yet absolutely ascertained, but in all probability the major 
ity in both branches will be federal. This I suppose to be 
principally the effect of the embargo, an effect which will not 
be confined to this part of the country. 



TO THE HONORABLE SENATE AND HOUSE OF 

REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COMMONWEALTH 

OF MASSACHUSETTS 

BOSTON, 8 June, 1808. 
GENTLEMEN: 

It has been my endeavor, as I have conceived it was my 
duty while holding a seat in the Senate of the Union, to 
support the Administration of the general government in all 
necessary measures within its competency, the object of 
which was to preserve from seizure and depredation the 
persons and property of our citizens, and to vindicate the 
rights essential to the independence of our country, against 
the unjust pretensions and aggressions of all foreign powers. 

Certain resolutions recently passed by you have expressed 
your disapprobation of measures to which under the influence 
of these motives I gave my assent. As far as the opinions of 
a majority in the legislature can operate, I cannot but con 
sider these resolutions as enjoining upon the representation 
of the State in Congress a sort of opposition to the national 
administration, in which I cannot consistently with my prin 
ciples concur. 

To give you however the opportunity of placing in the 
Senate of the United States a member, who may devise and 

rescue him from their triumphs. I know not how this can be done otherwise than 
by finding him a foreign appointment of respectability." James Sullivan to Jef

TO ORCHARD COOK 2 

BOSTON, [22] August, 1808. 
DEAR SIR: 

Your favor of the 24th and 3Oth last month came a few 
days since to my hands. I am duly sensible of the expres 
sion of your sentiments contained in it, in relation personally 
to me. Under the present situation and circumstances of the 
country I certainly should not have thought myself justi 
fiable in retiring from the public service, had it been left at 
my option to remain in it. But when the election was pre 
cipitated at the May session of the legislature contrary to 
all example, and apparently for the sole purpose of manifest- 

1 See Mass. Hist. Soc. Proceedings, XLV. 354-374. 

"My conduct as a public man, having been invariably and exclusively governed 
by a sense of public duty, I cannot but be gratified that it has met your approbation. 
Dictated by principles more durable in their nature than the passions of individuals 
or the prejudices of party, I confidently trust that it will eventually be estimated 
at its true value by the general sentiment of my country. To the merit of good in 
tentions, it is entitled; to that of zeal for the preservation of our national Union and 
independence, it has a claim equally just. The rest is in the judgment of others and 
I shall cheerfully leave it to the deliberate decision of the nation. Union and in 
dependence are the Herculean pillars of my political system, and if they ever fall, 
I am content to fall with them, or to say 

Sistimus hue tandem, ubi nobis defuit orbis."

ing the disposition of the ruling majority with regard to me, 
and when the same majority had passed resolutions in my 
view unconstitutional, and calculated in their effect, as far 
as they could operate, to sacrifice the best wishes of this 
nation to the unjust claims and pretensions of a foreign 
power, I could not consistently with my principles continue 
for a moment longer the representative of a body of men, 
whose policy was so utterly abhorrent to what I conceive 
the sacred duties of every independent American. 

In resigning my seat for the ensuing session, I felt the less 
reluctance at the sacrifice, from a full conviction upon my 
mind that no exertion of mine could materially aid the public 
service, and that the substitution of another member of the 
Senate in my stead would not in the slightest degree affect the 
general policy of the government. It is possible that my 
views of public affairs are too conciliatory for the temper of 
any party. But I hope there will yet be in Congress and in 
the nation, an energy of union sufficient to counteract all 
the personal interests, all the electioneering passions, and 
all the paltry geographical jealousies and envies, which con 
stitute the repulsive parts of our political system. 

I am altogether incapable of giving you any information 
upon which reliance could be placed, respecting the prob 
abilities of the issue in which the approaching presidential 
election will terminate. I do not however imagine that the 
federalists will eventually take the part of Mr. Clinton. I 
presume they will support candidates of their own, though I 
know not who they will be. 

There has been a meeting of the inhabitants of this town, 1 
in which a petition to the President was voted, requesting 
him to suspend the embargo in whole or in part, and if he 
has any doubt of his power, to call Congress together im- 

1 August 9. The petition is in The Repertory, August 12, 1 808. 



2 4 o THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

mediately. The alleged ground of this proceeding is the 
recent revolution in Spain. 1 And the first idea was to ask 
for a suspension of the embargo, at least so far as related to 
Spain and her colonies. The object was accomplished in this 
form at Newbury Port, 2 where a meeting was held on the 
same day with that in this town. But here some objections 
were urged in town-meeting by the opponents to the meas 
ure, which occasioned a different modification of the petition, 
and the request from Boston is couched in more general 
terms. It appeared to be understood as of course that the 
removal of the embargo must be succeeded by an immediate 
war, which was loudly and distinctly called for by the peti 
tioners in town-meeting, but for which it is very apparent 
since the meeting, that the generality of the inhabitants of 
this town are not yet prepared. 

If the people have not, as some of your friends think, vir 
tue enough to bear that embargo, which was so necessary 
to preserve their dearest rights and their best interests, I 
know not where they will find virtue to bear that war, which 
must take its place. I have always considered that the true 
and only alternative was this embargo or war; and I re 
main unshaken in that opinion. Now, although embargo is 
beyond all question a distressing calamity to this country, 
yet in comparison with war, either with Britain or France, I 
still esteem it as no more than the bite of a flea to the bite of 
a rattlesnake. 

The accounts from Spain are indeed of high importance, 
though coming as they do through the medium of British 
representations, we must wait somewhat longer before we 
can distinctly discern their character. I do not think them 
sufficient grounds as yet for removing the embargo, and es-

i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 241 

pecially would it be in my opinion bad policy to remove it 
partially in favor of the Spanish Jimtoists a partiality 
which both France and Britain would be justified in resent 
ing, unless we have evidence that the Spanish revolutionists 
have repealed the decrees against our commerce, which their 
old government had adopted. 

It is however natural to indulge hopes from any material 
change in the state of national affairs, when the state from 
which the change occurs is very bad. The commotions in 
Spain, I love to hope, will at least give so much employment 
to France as to awaken interests there sufficiently strong to 
produce relaxation in the French decrees against our trade, 
and that these will be preceded or followed by like relaxations 
on the part of Britain. In both or either of these cases we 
shall be immediately released from the pressures of the em 
bargo, without being driven into the war, and the great sys 
tem of American neutrality in European wars, which Wash 
ington with so much difficulty established, and which it has 
always been so difficult to maintain, will be preserved from 
the most violent assault, and the most imminent danger to 
which it has ever been exposed. Yet so precarious are the 
effects which follow from great events, that I am expressing 
now rather ardent wishes than sanguine expectations. There 
is another and more unpleasant possibility, that Britain 
of all the nations upon earth most prone to grow insolent 
upon success instead of relaxing will be encouraged to 
persevere, and to enlarge upon her system of hostility to 
neutral trade. To this she has had and still has too much 
encouragement from this country, where party spirit and 
profligate ambition have so strong a predominancy over the 
spirit of patriotism, that in every insult and outrage we have 
suffered from England, some have been ready to support 
her, and where men of great passions and little souls have 



242 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

been ready to sacrifice the birth-rights of the country, be 
cause with them their political rivals and antagonists would 
also be sacrificed. 

What the President will do upon the applications for re 
moving the embargo at this time I know not. And if it 
should continue until Congress meet, the question will still 
be difficult and important, what shall be substituted in its 
stead. If a majority of the two houses could be obtained of 
your and my mind, the substitute might be found. But I 
pray to Heaven, and I confidently trust, that it will contain 
no ingredient of base submission to any foreign usurpation, 
no surrender of that inheritance which it is our sacred duty 
to transmit as we received it unimpaired. In God s name 
let us have no sanctions of our own admission for British im 
pressments or British taxation. 

I am, &c. 

TO WILLIAM BRANCH GILES 

BOSTON, 15 November, 1808. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

Accept my best thanks for your friendly and obliging 
favors of the yth 1 and 8th, with the copy of the message. 
The regret which you are good enough to express at not meet 
ing me in the Senate chamber, is at once so kind and so 
flattering that it will, I hope, furnish me an excuse for ex 
plaining fully to you, why you did not meet me there. 

I presume it unnecessary to mention to you that my im 
mediate constituents, the legislature of Massachusetts, had 
already provided that I should meet nobody there after

respondence with Adams in 1808-1809, see Ib; 34- 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 243 

the present session. Had mine been an ordinary case, this 
circumstance would not have induced me to resign the re 
mainder of the term. But in the face of every former ex 
ample, the election of a Senator was precipitated at the sum 
mer session of the legislature, instead of waiting for the 
usual time, which would have been in February next, and the 
point of unseating me was carried by such means, as, I 
suppose, are common enough among electioneering parti 
sans, but manifest a much higher estimate of the prize at 
stake, than I have ever accustomed myself to bestow upon 
anything in the shape of public office. It seemed as if the 
salvation of the country, or what was substituted for the 
country, was thought to depend upon getting me out. But 
this was not all. The same legislature passed resolutions in 
the nature of instructions to their Senators, which I utterly 
disapproved, and which if I had retained my place, I should 
have held it my duty not only to decline supporting, but to 
resist to the utmost of my power. Placed thus in the dilemma 
between the respect due to the will, so strongly manifested 
by my special constituents, and the still more imperious duty 
to my country, under a sentence of official prescription by the 
former, and under the falsest and most odious imputations 
upon my motives, my conduct during the session that was 
approaching would either not have been that of a free agent, 
or it would have been at the hazard of sacrifices, personal 
and domestic, which upon full deliberation I did not think the 
occasion required me to incur. As to holding my seat in the 
Senate of the United States without exercising the most 
perfect freedom of agency, under the sole and exclusive con 
trol of my own sense of right, that was out of the question. 
But I was aware of the obligation upon a citizen, charged 
with a public trust, to remain at his post unless duly relieved, 
and that these were times when the obligation pressed with 



244 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

peculiar force. This consideration induced me long to hesi 
tate before I decided upon my resignation, and the idea 
which finally turned the balance in my mind, was the per 
fect confidence I had in the firmness and wisdom of the 
Senate, as I knew it would remain composed at the present 
session. I knew the vast majority of that body would neither 
betray nor surrender the essential rights of the nation. I 
saw no danger in that quarter which could need any inter 
position, which it would be in my power as an individual 
member to present, and I could not flatter myself that I 
should be able to render any public service by my particular 
exertion, which could compensate for that self-degradation, 
to which I must have submitted in continuing to serve prin 
cipals, who had no confidence in their agent, and whose 
measures were as abhorrent to his sentiments, as his conduct 
had been to theirs. It was a subject upon which I thought 
myself obligated to take no counsel, but that of my own heart 
and understanding, and my resolution was taken with great 
reluctance. For I should have rejoiced in the opportunity to 
have manifested to the last moment of my official life, my 
adherence to the principles upon which I had uniformly 
acted, and my zealous cooperation in the measures, adopted 
by Congress in harmony with the executive, to resist the 
outrages of both the great warring powers of Europe. 

With regard to the public reproaches in pamphlets and 
newspapers, with which I have been favored, and which, 
knowing as you do their falsehood, your friendly concern 
has led you to see with regret, I shall confess to you that 
instead of seeing them, as perhaps a public man ought to do, 
with cool indifference, I have perhaps observed them with 
too much satisfaction. I have felt on this occasion a little 
of the spirit of martyrdom; knowing that my governing 
motives have been pure, disinterested and patriotic, I con- 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 245 

sidered every calumny cast upon me, as the tribute of prof 
ligate passions to honest principle. As the temper of a 
weapon can be ascertained only by a trial, I have been 
pleased to undergo that test, which no man of truly honor 
able purpose can escape. I have enjoyed all along that sort 
of support, which is beyond the reach of human slander, the 
support of my own conscious integrity. And I had the ad 
ditional satisfaction of reflecting, that there existed even in 
the knowledge of others, particularly in yours, evidence that 
my public conduct had not been stimulated by any personal 
or selfish views. I had no doubt, that if any occasion should 
require it, you would not withhold that testimony, which 
might be exclusively in your possession, but I have never 
seen any reason for believing that it would ever be necessary 
for my justification. 

In relation to future time, whether my fellow-citizens in 
this Commonwealth will ever again think such services as 
I can render them worth calling for, is for their consideration 
not for mine. Our usages do not authorize even those who 
are candidates for popular election to offer themselves, and 
if they did, there is no station in their gift for which I should 
feel the slightest inclination to solicit their suffrages. What 
ever of profit or of honor there may be in the piping times of 
peace in the public service, I know that, in the present situa 
tion and prospects of this country, public office of any kind 
would to me be an oppressive burden, a post of little else 
than toil and danger, a thankless task from which I could 
anticipate nothing better, and might rationally apprehend a 
catastrophe infinitely worse than that which has befallen 
me. If then recovering from that delusion to which you 
refer, they should hereafter entertain a more favorable opin 
ion of my intentions and of my capacity to serve them faith 
fully, the manifestation of their wishes will always be in their 



246 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

power, and neither difficulty nor danger shall deter me from 
any service, which they can demand and which I can render. 

Let me again apologize to you for saying so much of myself. 
As the circumstances of the last session led me in the confi 
dence which your character and situation had inspired, to 
unfold to you in the most explicit manner my personal views, 
or rather the absence of all personal views, in connection 
with my public conduct, I could not now resist the oppor 
tunity of opening to you with equal frankness the motives, 
upon which I have acted to the close of my career. And I 
will only add, that far from regretting any one of those acts 
for which I have suffered, I would do them over again, were 
they now to be done at the hazard of ten times as much 
slander, unpopularity, and (if that were possible) displace 
ment. 

In the removal to a private station, however, under a gov 
ernment like ours, a man, though relieved from the burden 
of responsibility, cannot cease to feel a concern for the af 
fairs of the public. And while the independence and union 
of the nation are at stake upon the perseverance and energy 
of those who administer its affairs and of the people, no 
man with an American heart can stand by and behold the 
struggle with indifference. That we have gone thus far 
without being involved as parties in the war, and without 
the abandonment of one national right, is to me a subject of 
much consolation; but difficulties, obstacles and dangers 
seem to multiply as we advance, the pressure of foreign in 
justice continues with increasing aggravation, and combining 
with internal party spirit encroaches upon the resolution of 
the people, so as sometimes to make me doubtful whether 
they will continually prove true to themselves, through the 
long and severe trial they have to go through. The result of 
the recent elections has, indeed, upon the whole been highly 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 247 

to their credit, and promises a steadiness equal to my best 
expectations. The recent events in Europe, though I hope 
their ultimate consequences will be salutary, have in their 
immediate effects been unpropitious to us, by encouraging 
the insolence and injustice of Great Britain, without cor 
recting that of France, and unfortunately we have too many 
among us who, to say the least, are ready to let the rights of 
the country go, provided they can see their political op 
ponents overwhelmed in the same ruin. 

The President s message has presented a state of things 
not unexpected though gloomy. 1 We have seen of the docu 
ments only a short letter from General Armstrong, and the 
two latest papers between Mr. Pinkney and Mr. Canning. 
You will not flatter yourself that these documents will 
silence the tales of French influence and partiality to Napo 
leon. The more absurd this story grows, the more rooted it 
will become in the soil of faction, and by the time it shall 
have been proved impossible, it will become an article of 
faith, to doubt of which would lead to the stake, if there 
were power to plant one. 

I observe that your motion 2 in the Senate contemplates 
a further continuance of the embargo laws, while that of 
Mr. Eppes 3 in the House appears to prefer a substitute, 
which would partially open our trade. Between a choice 
of great evils, I trust that candor and patriotic deliberation 
will finally discern which is the least. I can scarcely venture 
to entertain an opinion, though if the non-intercourse could 
be carried into effect, I should incline to think it better

than that internal stagnation, which may send too much 
blood to the head. As change, it would in some sort discon 
cert opposition, by necessitating a change also in their bat 
teries. But whether it would not increase the danger of war 
(the trap in which they still hope to catch the present ad 
ministration) is [for] your better and wiser consideration. 
At all events I conclude with the sentiment which I know will 
meet with the most cordial sympathy in your mind, ANY 
THING BUT SUBMISSION. I am, &c. 

TO EZEKIEL BACON 

BOSTON, November lyth, 1808. 



MY DEAR SIR: 

Your obliging letter of the 8th instant, with a copy of the 
President s message at the commencement of the session, 
has come to hand. I see with much concern, though without 
surprise, that the prospect of obtaining anything like justice 
from the great belligerent powers of Europe, is no better 
than it was at the close of the last session. The alternatives 
mentioned in your letter embrace all the varieties of policy, 
between which a choice can be made. Among these that of 
declaring war I presume will have the fewest advocatesc 
The wrongs we are suffering from both the scourges of man 
kind are so similar, that we would scarcely assume a founda 
tion for the declaration against one, which would not equally 
require it against the other, and a declaration against either 
would place the country in a more dangerous situation, and 
the administration in a deeper perplexity to get along, than 
can arise from the present state of things. A war with Eng 
land would probably soon if not immediately be complicated 

1 On the part played by Ezekiel Bacon in the repeal of the embargo, see Henry 
Adams, History, IV. 432-463. 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 249 

with a civil war, and with a desperate effort to break up the 
Union, the project for which has been several years prepar 
ing in this quarter, and which waits only for a possible 
chance of popular support to explode. A war with France 
would be extremely unpopular in every part of the Union, 
for it would be odious to all the friends of the administration, 
as directly contrary to the permanent interests and policy 
of the Union; and although it would exactly meet the wishes 
of the tories, yet it would not be with the view to support the 
administration in carrying on the war, but as a ground for 
pursuing further measures of attack against the adminis 
tration itself. Nor is there any prospect that we should at 
the issue of a war with either power obtain any security for 
any rights, which we may not at least as reasonably expect 
by further perseverance in the pacific policy. War, there 
fore, I presume we shall not immediately have. Under the 
present state of affairs, to open our commerce with permis 
sion to arm in defence of the exercise of neutral trade, would 
be war in the result, though it would be upon a principle more 
exclusively defensive, than would be implied in a declaration. 
Arming, both public and private, was the system which in 
my particular opinion ought to have been adopted last win 
ter, immediately after the embargo was first laid; but at 
that time I found very few of any party who thought with 
me, and now the season for it is past, even if it was then ex 
pedient. 

The circumstances, too, of the present time render it much 
more questionable to my mind than it was then. The British 
Orders of Council were then not sanctioned by Parliament. 
The Milan decree, and I know not how many others equally 
savage, had not issued. The very determination of resistance 
then manifested might have deterred from these extremities 
of outrage. 



250 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

The British government had not been stimulated to per 
severance, either by the Spanish and Portuguese diversion 
in their favor, or by the open and shameless support which 
they have found from faction in this country. 

Arming now would be less efficacious as a measure for pre 
serving peace, would lead more inevitably to war, and would 
have less support from the approbation of the people. The 
real choice, then, seems to be, between a continuance of the 
embargo, and its removal, with a substitution of total non- 
intercourse with France and England in its stead. For as to 
submission, I will not disgrace the Congress of this Union 
so much as to suppose, that this project will receive any coun 
tenance from either branch of the legislative authority. 

Between the embargo and the non-intercourse system, 
under my present state of information I should strongly in 
cline to the last. It would, indeed, incur a new hazard of 
eventual war abroad, but I think it would remove the risk of 
war at home for the present. I believe the embargo cannot 
possibly be continued much longer, without meeting direct 
and forcible resistance in this part of the country. The 
people have been so long stimulated to this forcible re 
sistance, and they have been so unequivocally led to expect 
support from the State authorities in such resistance, that 
I do not think the temptation will be much longer withstood. 
If the law should be openly set at defiance, and broken by 
direct violence under support from the State authorities, 
it is to be considered how the general government will be able 
to carry it through. No doubt by military execution. But 
that will make civil war, the very point at which the tories 
are driving, and in the event of which it may at least be con 
jectured that they have already secured British support 
and assistance. For it is precisely in this form, an organized 
insurrection against the national government by State au- 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 251 

thority, that the project of disunion can alone be accom 
plished, and that this project has been in serious contempla 
tion of those, whom you describe as being called in England 
Colonel P[ickering] s party, for several years, I know by the 
most unequivocal evidence, though it be not provable in a 
court of law. To this project as matured, a very small party 
of the federal party is privy. The great proportion of them 
do not even believe its existence. They are not prepared for 
supporting this system, and the object of the leaders is, to 
take advantage of every circumstance which can enable them 
to work upon the popular mind to support the scheme of 
division by the necessary force. Now the embargo is, un 
fortunately, one of those measures, upon which the two pub 
lic authorities may be brought in collision with each other, 
and that the party has been laboring with unwearied indus 
try to produce that effect, the proceedings of our legislature, 
the instigations to resistance against the embargo laws on the 
pretence of their unconstitutionality, the countenance given 
to this paltry pretence by a STATE JUDGE [Parsons], and the 
connection between his extra-judicial opinions and the at 
tempts at forcible resistance, which have already been made, 
and with the experiment upon the District Court at Salem, 
afford the evidence, which the most purblind observer cannot 
but observe. 1 A non-intercourse, it seems to me, would not 
be so liable to this species of opposition as an embargo. An 
other reason for preferring it is, that in the spirit of party, the 
faction is afraid of it. For among themselves, I know that 
they chuckle and exult as much at the operation of the em 
bargo, as in public they whine and rave against it. They now 
feel perfectly confident that the embargo will not answer its 
purpose as a compulsory measure, and they hope to see the 
government so pledged to it, as not to be able consistently to 

1 Adams, New England Federalism, 223. 



252 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

depart from it. The non-intercourse would take away from 
them a great part of the two impostures by which they have 
been playing upon the jealousies of the people, that the ad 
ministration act under the dictates of France, and that they 
intend the total annihilation of commerce. 

I do not mean that it would entirely remove these despica 
ble calumnies, for popular jealousy, like individual jealousy, 
will feed and thrive upon trifles lighter than air; but the ma 
chine would not work so well under the non-intercourse sys 
tem, as they will under the continuance of the embargo. 

I am aware that in reply to these observations there are 
many forcible reasons which may be alleged for persevering* 
precisely in the stand which we have taken. We are sure 
that will not produce war, for both France and England have 
avowed that they do not consider it as a cause of war. It 
would have the appearance of a more steady and determinate 
purpose, and it would not expose to foreign depredation that 
property, and to impressment and captivity those seamen, 
which have hitherto been preserved. Legislative delibera 
tion, and mutual communication of ideas and information 
between those members of the executive and legislature, 
who concur in the pursuit of the same end, will doubtless 
shed on the whole subject a light, by which you will at last 
most safely proceed. That it may ultimately secure our 
peace, independence and union, I confidently hope and fer 
vently pray. 

The proceedings of our legislature, relative to the choice 
of presidential electors, will come before you at the proper 
time. They are unprecedented, and the precedent they ex 
hibit is a very bad one. A suspicious temper would conclude 
that this mode of proceeding was adopted for the express 
purpose of producing a new collision between the State and 
the Union. This purpose, however, will I hope be frustrated. 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 253 

There may be a great constitutional question, how far the 
authority of Congress extends with regard to the rejection of 
votes returned from the States for the presidential election; 
and although I have no doubt that the State legislature on 
these proceedings have violated our own constitution, yet 
I should wish if possible to avoid stirring the other question 
upon these returns. The most prudent course in my mind 
will be to receive the votes, and count them, leaving it to 
the people of this Commonwealth, if they think proper, to 
vindicate their own constitution from the outrages of their 
own representatives. Of this, however, you, who will be on 
the spot and acting under the responsibility of your public 
trust, will decide with full consideration. 

I have, my dear sir, according to your desire given you my 
opinions in the fullest confidence and sincerity. It will give 
me pleasure to hear from you as often as your leisure will 
permit, and with unabated ardor for the cause of our coun 
try, I remain, &c. 

P. S. In using the term lories in this letter I mean to 
designate the partisans for a French war and for submission 
to Great Britain. They do not include the whole federal 
party, but they now -preside over its policy. They are 
the political descendants in direct line from the tories of 
our Revolutionary war, and hold most of their speculative 
opinions. 

TO ORCHARD COOK 

BOSTON, November 25, 1808. 
DEAR SIR: 

Your obliging letter, with the message at the opening of 
the session, and a copy of the public documents communi 
cated with the message, have been duly received; and also 



254 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

your motion to authorize arming by the citizens of the 
United States against British and French aggressions upon 
the seas. 1 I see with deep anxiety, though not with surprise, 
that no gleam of light is yet discernible on the horizon of our 
public affairs. If the whole nation duly felt the sense of its 
own dignity, and there were no partialities either to France 
or Britain, my concern would be incomparably less; for of 
nations as well as individuals, it may be justly said, that ad 
versity is the trier of spirits, and we have grown so plethoric 
upon prosperity, that the other face of fortune was necessary 
to remind us that we are not exempt from humanity. 

The policy of removing the embargo laws without sub 
stituting anything in their stead was so obviously absurd, 
that I did not expect it would find many supporters in Con 
gress. 2 To say that every individual merchant and insurer 
should be left to judge of his own risks is very easy, but the 
government is bound to protect its citizens and their prop 
erty upon the ocean; and when the merchants do meet with 
losses by the injustice of belligerent powers, they do call, 
and they have a right to call, upon the government of the 
nation to interfere and maintain their rights. The flood of 
memorials to Congress in the winter of 1805 and 1806, upon 
which the non-importation act and Mr. Pinkney s mission 
to England were founded, sufficiently demonstrate that the 
merchants know full well their right to call upon Congress 
to maintain their rights, and that they are ready enough to

2 "The feds in private conversation say, all we have to do is to take off the embargo, 
and let every merchant take care of his own concerns that is, submission. I have 
argued with them that their plan of permitting trade to regulate itself in their sense, 
goes to render useless our Constitution, and indeed all government or all union of 
interests; and would place us in a worse state than we were at the time the country 
called for a constitution to nationalize us, and advance and defend our commercial 
rights." Orchard Cook to John Quincy Adams y November 10, 1808. Ms. 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 255 

exercise it, when the occasion will justify them. And, un 
doubtedly, they would do so again, if their trade were open, 
and the French or British should consequently take and con 
fiscate their property. Nay, the very indulgence of Congress 
on opening their trade would be used by them as an argument 
for pledging the nation to support them; they would say, our 
property was secured by the embargo from foreign depreda 
tion; the Congress thought proper to remove that restriction; 
we sent out our ships and cargoes on the faith of this permis 
sion, and they have been seized and confiscated. We demand 
the aid of the national arm to recover and to shelter this 
property. To this claim what answer could be given? 
There could be but one alternative War, or unequivocal 
confession that we have not, and can not pretend to the 
rights of an independent nation. It is, therefore, impossible 
to throw the whole burden of the controversy upon the cal 
culations of mercantile speculation. The rights of the 
nation are at stake upon it as much as the property of in 
dividuals, and the Congress cannot abandon the one without 
sacrificing the other. 

It is very true that every nation had a right to lay a duty 
upon exports, although by our Constitution the nation has 
forbidden the exercise of that right. But the questions be 
tween Great Britain and us do not in the least implicate a 
controversy of that principle. It is not an export duty, but 
a transit duty on property bound elsewhere, and which she 
forcibly seizes and carries into her own ports, that she now 
requires and levies; it is substantially and unequivocally 
tribute for navigating the ocean. To this I am not ready to 
submit, and I hope the nation will spurn at it with resolute 
perseverance. 

I am glad you have had a satisfactory explanation from 
Mr. Madison upon points on which the British faction have 



256 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

endeavored to inspire jealousies between the northern States 
and the rest of the Union. 1 It is unquestionable that the 
points in contest between us and England are of commercial 
rights and commercial interests points upon which the 
welfare and prosperity of New England more than that of 
any other portion of the continent depend. 

29th November, 1808. 

Since I began this letter, we have received the report of 
the Committee on Foreign Relations, which exhibits the 
state of our affairs in a very concise and lucid manner. 2 Its 
moderation and its firmness will be gratifying to all the 
friends of the country, and will not be without their effect 
upon some honest though timid and wavering minds. For 
my own person, I do most sincerely rejoice to find that the 
spirit of Congress appears so determined on the indispensa 
ble point of maintaining the national rights. And after the 
proper deliberation on the choice of means, I shall cordially 
acquiesce in those which may be finally determined upon. 
We shall probably have difficulty to get along here in peace, 
but the rights of the country must not be abandoned. 

I congratulate you and still more the country upon your

TO NAHUM PARKER 

BOSTON, 5 December, 1808. 
DEAR SIR: 

I have this moment received your favor of the 25th of last 
month, inclosing also the report from the Committee on 
Foreign Relations. Before the appearance of this document, 
the inclination of my own opinion has been that the most ex 
pedient measure to adopt at this time would have been a 
substitution of total non-intercourse with France and Eng 
land, instead of continuing the embargo. But I perceive the 
policy there recommended is superaddition of non-intercourse 
to the embargo. The reasoning of the report is so strong, 
that I do not see how it can be successfully controverted, but 
that there will be internal difficulties of execution in case of a 
further continuance of the embargo, which I hope will be 
thoroughly considered before the ultimate system shall be 
decided upon. Whatever shall be eventually determined will, 
I have no doubt, be strongly supported, even in our part of 
the country, but it must also be prepared to meet a strong 
and dangerous kind of opposition. 

I have heard the rumor of an intention existing somewhere, 
to have a convention called at New Haven, to consider the 
expediency of a division of the States, or a secession of New 
England from the Union. 1 Knowing as I do that such a

258 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

project has been heretofore seriously contemplated, and that 
it is now avowedly desired by some persons whom I consider 
as the mouth pieces of others less communicative of their 
designs, I perceive no absolute improbability in the report. 
Yet I rather believe the purpose not yet sufficiently matured. 
The policy of a separation is, indeed, avowed in some quar 
ters, with a sort of ostentation which indicates rather an ex 
pectation that it will produce its effect as a menace, than a 
deliberate purpose for execution. They who use it in this 
view have not yet learnt the necessary political lesson, never 
to threaten where you do not intend to strike. 

The documents transmitted with the President s message 
have produced an apparent effect upon the opinions of those, 
who have any candor left which their feelings will suffer them 
to exercise. The charges of partiality to France in the con 
duct of the Administration are, for the present, not so bold, 
and they are more discredited than they have been hereto 
fore. Jealousy will not, however, be convinced, and preju 
dice will not weigh evidence. In some minds the forgery of 
Talleyrand s letter is more conclusive than all Mr. Arm 
strong s correspondence. 

The greatest of all dangers to the Administration and its 
friends is that of internal dissension. The differences of 
opinion relative to the presidential election have contributed 
much to increase this danger. It is, however, still to be 
hoped that when all questions on the subject shall have been 
settled by the regular course of the Constitution, the candi 
dates who have been found in the minority, with their 
friends and partisans, will be sensible of the common interest 
and common duty to maintain the cause of their country. 
If they firmly manifest this determination, I believe the 
country will not desert them. Union at the center will send 
forth shoots of vigor to every part of the circumference. 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 259 

Whatever difference of opinion there may be on the system 
to be adopted, when once resolved upon by the concurrence 
of the majority, there must be no hesitation or wavering to 
carry it into effect. All must concur to the extent of their 
power. The want of this hearty cooperation among its 
friends has already weakened the government infinitely 
more than the inveteracy of its open opponents. We must 
bear and forbear, we must conciliate and harmonize. Every 
man must set himself and his pretensions aside before the 
great interest of the nation. He must sacrifice the pride of 
opinion and the wish for safety by retreat. The cause is just 
before Heaven, the stake is the nation s right. The means 
are the best that honest intention and deliberate consulta 
tion can elaborate. Persevere, and you will triumph at the 
last. 

I beg you, my dear sir, to present my kind remembrance 
to all those members of the Senate with whom I should have 
rejoiced to cooperate in the present crisis, as zealously and 
as honestly, as I did upon its approaches last winter. Re 
leased from the perils and from the honors of your situation, 
I look with the concern of sympathetic feeling on the re 
sponsibility with which you are still charged, and with the 
sincerest wish that your services may be successful and ac 
ceptable to your country. At any rate I can assure you from 
experience, that even to fail in rendering them acceptable 
is no subject of self-displeasure or regret, when the conscious 
ness of right intentions and of exertions to the utmost of our 
means remains unaltered by the event. 

I am, &c.

TO ORCHARD COOK 

BOSTON, 8 December, 1808. 
DEAR SIR: 

Since I had the pleasure of writing you last, I have received 
two of your favors, the last inclosing your reply to the resolu 
tions of our legislature relative to the embargo. 1 For these 
papers, in particular for you own communications, I tender 
you my sincerest thanks. I will take the earliest opportunity 
of forwarding to you a copy of the pamphlet you request, 2 
and if it is to be procured in town will send it by the same mail 
with this. 

On the particular subject of your letter of 27 November it 
is difficult for me either to be totally silent or to speak with 
propriety. I cannot be insensible, nor can I refuse myself 
the pleasure of assuring you that I am not insensible, to the 
good opinion on your part of me, which is indicated in the 
course you have pursued, and in the wishes which you ex 
press. The divisions however which you intimate in the 
anticipation of the election, I trust and hope have not taken 
place. The great interest of the nation at the present 
moment requires harmony and conciliation among those, 

1 "The report and resolutions of a majority of the legislature have passed and 
been published since I conversed with you. This report contains doctrines, rather 
principles and opinions, which in my humble judgment are at variance with the 
rights, the honor, and the interests of the country. What do you think of meeting 
with two or three gentlemen to consult and consider whether it may be useful and 
advisable to express, either to the government or to the public, a counter opinion; 
and if so, to determine on the most eligible manner of doing it. This report, to 
gether with the Essex proceedings, appears to me to require animadversion and 
notice of some kind or other. I had thought of commencing with three or five 
gentlemen in whom confidence can be placed, and thence enlarging the circle as 
should be judged expedient." William Eustis to John Quincy Adams, November 26, 
1808. Ms.

who intend to maintain its rights. If the Vice President and 
his particular friends have wavered a little more than they 
could justify to the sternest principles of patriotism upon the 
recent system of the present administration, the successful 
candidate and his friends should recollect the peculiar situa 
tion in which Mr. C[linton] has been placed, and make 
allowances for the feelings of human nature. I do not think 
that the Vice President and his supporters are irrecoverably 
gone, and I wish that no just inducement should be given 
them to stray from the path of their country s necessity. 
Judge Anderson s 1 anticipation was certainly founded on 
inaccurate information. 2 I recollect with great pleasure the 
cordiality of agreement between his sentiments and mine on 
the public questions of the last session, and I beg you to 
present me kindly to his remembrance. As there can be no 
occasion for me to intimate what my feelings of justice to 
wards Mr. C. would dictate on the case supposed, there 
must be affectation in the suggestion of them. 

With regard to the other possibility intimated in your 
letter, there is perhaps still more of delicacy to be observed 
by me. I shall simply state to you that my principle of con 
duct with regard to official station always has been, and con 
tinues to be, that which philosophers teach us should guide 
our views of death never to be desired, never to be 
feared leaving all nomination and appointment to the 
constitutional organ, and reserving only to myself the right 
of answering as a sense of duty may direct to the call of the 
proper authority.

and from some other circumstances, I had been led to expect 
that the embargo would be continued; and although I see the 
thorns with which every departure from that system must 
be beset, yet I incline to think the course, which your last 
letter mentions as likely to be adopted, will be the most 
eligible. It will doubtless increase the immediate danger of 
foreign war, but it will diminish the dangers of internal 
commotion. In case, indeed, of foreign war, we must be 
blind not to perceive that there will be an internal foe to deal 
with, as well as the enemy beyond sea, a foe which, if cir 
cumstances should permit, will hang upon a non-intercourse 
or upon any other measure of defence, as they now do upon 
the embargo and the proclamation. Yet of the party which 
now countenances them in their treachery to their country, 
a great proportion will abandon them in the hour of extrem 
ity. The spirit of the nation, I thank God, is not, and will 
not be broken. But the passions of the people will be less 
dangerous to themselves with a vent upon to spend them 
abroad, than where concentrated upon themselves, as they 
must be by a much longer continuance of the embargo. The 
documents sent with the first message, the report of the Com 
mittee of Foreign Relations, and above all the unbroken 
phalanx of republicans on the three resolutions, have pro 
duced a manifest effect upon the public mind here. 1 I hope 
it will continue. But there must be some issue found for the 
restless spirit, and some guard against the desperation of 
want. Heaven grant you may find a safe one. 
I am, etc.

i8o8J JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 263 

TO WILLIAM BRANCH GILES 

BOSTON, loth December, 1808. 
DEAR SIR: 

I cannot postpone for a moment my thanks to you for the 
copy of your speech x on the resolution proposed by Mr. 
Hillhouse, to raise the embargo, and my still warmer thanks 
as an American citizen for the speech itself. If I must lament 
that in my native section of the Union, a concurrence of un 
fortunate circumstances has given prevalence to a political 
system compounded of ignorance and treachery to the rights 
of this nation, in the spirit of sincere piety I thank God, that 
able and successful assertors of those rights are yet found in 
other quarters, who will not suffer that disgraceful submis 
sion to foreign insolence and outrage, which I have been 
doomed to hear recommended by men, who still pretend to 
call themselves Americans. 

The threats of resistance against the laws of the Union 
and of separation, which your subject called you to notice, 
will I hope counteract the dangers which they announce. 
The people in this quarter are in general deeply attached to 
the Union, and they have, as you justly represent, a profound 
veneration for the authority of the law. To counteract this 
sentiment, you know that the doctrine has been broached 
here that the embargo laws were unconstitutional, and as 
such not entitled to submission. The history of this doc 
trine, and the manner in which it was propagated until the 
decision of the district judge at Salem, 2 is perhaps not fully 
known to you. While you have been candidly informed of 
the regular gradation through petition, remonstrance and

264 THE WRITINGS OF Ii8o8 

legislative resolutions, to insurrection and rebellion against 
the Union, which are here avowed and recommended, you 
have not been told how important a step in the progress a 
judicial decision against the embargo laws was intended to 
be. You have not heard what means were used and by 
whom to bias that decision, nor how much disappointment 
has followed from that honest firmness and incorruptible 
integrity of our district judge. These are things of which 
little will be said, but whoever traces the real history of our 
advance towards resistance will not forget the judicial bat 
tery, which has been attempted to be brought into action, nor 
fail to perceive the effect with which it would have operated, 
if it could have been brought to bear. In speaking of the 
firmness and integrity of the district judge, and of the means 
used to bias his mind, I do not mean to hint at any direct 
attempt upon his honesty, but to a sort of influence which 
was certainly used, and which must have had its sway upon 
his judgment had not his good sense and his spirit been supe 
rior to every consideration of party management. 

It is intimated to us that the decision on the motion of 
Mr. Hillhouse will not preclude a partial renewal of our com 
merce, after the substitution of other measures of resistance 
against France and Britain shall have been matured. 

My opinion that upon the whole an opening of some sort 
to the humors as well as to the trade of the country must 
be made, continues and strengthens from day to day. The 
prohibition of trade with both belligerents will perhaps not 
be effectual to prevent it, but at least it will take away the 
responsibility of the government, and place it where they 
tell us it may safely be placed, exclusively at the risk of 
individual speculators. It may lead to war, but so may the 
non-intercourse as a superaddition to the embargo. Though 
the project of a New England confederacy will meet with 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 265 

many obstacles of which its advisers are not aware, yet I 
believe one of the greatest of them would be a conductor for 
the overcharge of electricity in the popular passions. A 
majority of our people are in that state of temper which will 
not reason, or hear reason; they only feel, and the prevailing 
party feed them with falsehood and suppress the truth, just 
as it serves their turn. 

Some accommodation to this state of things I cannot but 
hope will be made, though God forbid that it should be at the 
expense of any sacrifice of our essential rights. 

The newspapers will inform you of the death of our gov 
ernor on Saturday morning. 1 It will make no change in our 
political aspect until our next annual election. 

With great respect, etc. 



TO SAMUEL LATHAM MITCHILL 

BOSTON, 14 December, 1808. 
DEAR SIR: 

I duly received with great pleasure your favor of the 3rd 
instant. Recollecting with great satisfaction the harmony of 
political views, with which during the last and preceding 
sessions of Congress we had acted together, and that con 
geniality of literary taste and sentiment, which enabled me 
to derive so much instruction as well as entertainment from 
our occasional hours of social converse, I cannot but feel 
flattered with that substitute for personal communication, 
which in my present situation is offered me by your kind 
commencement of a correspondence by letters. I rejoiced 
also to find that my opinions, under the state of information 
which I can here possess, continue so exactly to correspond 

1 James Sullivan died December 10, 1808. 



266 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

with yours with regard to our public affairs. On Mr. Hill- 
house s motion I rejoiced to find that the sentiment and the 
resolution of the Senate remain unbroken. In favor of his 
resolution I saw but one name which I could have hoped not 
to see thus recorded, and it gave me very peculiar pleasure 
to see your name still united to the majority. 

At the same time I earnestly hope that some expedient will 
immediately be devised to remove the existing restrictions 
upon our trade, excepting all intercourse with the offending 
powers. There is certainly such a change of circumstances 
in the affairs of the world since the embargo was laid, that 
an accommodation to that change would be perfectly con 
sistent with the policy upon which it was laid, and appears 
to be imperiously required by our own present situation. Its 
effects have been great, and on the whole highly beneficial. 
It has preserved us from at least a year of war, and from 
immense losses of property and of men. As a coercive meas 
ure upon the belligerents I never had any faith in it, nor do I 
believe in its efficacy now. I will not say it cannot much 
longer be executed. But if it can, it must be through diffi 
culties and impediments which will aggravate the dangers 
and evils of our situation more than I am willing to hazard. 
You will not be surprised that these are my sentiments, when 
you recollect the resolution which I offered on the subject 
so long ago as last January. 1 The government have now a 
fair opportunity for changing their attitude of defence. But 
if this opportunity should be rejected, another may not 
present itself until it shall become a question of force be 
tween authority and obedience. As, therefore, I never could 
agree to the submission project of repealing the embargo 
laws, without substituting something else to maintain our 
natural rights, so I believe that the very defence of these 

1 Resolution, January n, 1808, p. 187, supra. 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 267 

rights will best be secured by a change of expedient. I speak, 
however, with submission to better judgment, and with an 
unvaried desire to support at every hazard whatever meas 
ures shall result from the declaration of our national councils. 

As the proceedings of my masters, the legislature of Massa 
chusetts, last June satisfied me that I was very ill suited to 
continue the representative of their majority, and as I fore 
saw no possible public injury from giving them immediately 
the opportunity to be represented according to their own 
heart s desire, I resigned my place for the remainder of the 
term during which I might have kept it. But I ventured still 
to perform the duties of a member of the Library Committee 
until I had expended the sum, which remained in my hands 
for that object. I sent a box of books which I learn has been 
received at the library, and have furnished Mr. Nourse an 
account, which he considers as sufficiently vouched for set 
tlement. As chairman of the committee I must beg your 
attention at the annual report to have the settlement of the 
account completed in form, so far as respects me. The dis 
charge of the duties assigned to me as a member of this com 
mittee was among the most pleasing of my official functions, 
and almost the only one the release from which could be to 
me a subject of personal regret. 

I beg you to present my respectful remembrance to the 
Vice President, to your colleague Mr. [John] Smith, and to 
any others of our old associates to whom it may be agreeable. 
Accept at the same time for yourself the assurances of my 
friendly regard, &c. 



268 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

TO JOSEPH ANDERSON 

BOSTON, 15 December, 1808. 
DEAR SIR: 

Among the many sacrifices that I thought proper to make, 
in order to give my very worthy but not approved good 
masters an immediate opportunity of stamping on the Senate 
of the United States an express image of themselves, was 
that of the pleasure which I had so constantly and cordially 
enjoyed, in cooperating with you in the transaction of our 
public affairs, and in the extra-official confidence and free 
communication of sentiments which had supported and 
guided me through the perplexities and difficulties of the 
last winter a confidence and freedom which I had flattered 
myself would be revived and rendered still more cheering to 
me in the increasing difficulties and perplexities of the present 
season. But when a majority of my immediate constituents 
had undertaken to instruct their representatives to act a part 
very unsuitable to my feelings, I could not refuse to myself 
the satisfaction of letting them know that I was as unambi 
tious of performing such services, as they were of assigning 
them to me. To be the organ of such opinions as they had 
avowed would have degraded me in my own, far below the 
condition of a slave. To have encountered them as a Senator 
of the Union with the honest and indignant dictates of my 
soul would have been my duty, but to what end? When 
Harry the 4th of France consulted Sully on a prospect of 
marriage, which in the dotage of his lust he was prepared to 
solemnize with one of his mistresses, and showed him the 
written promise to that effect which he had drawn up, Sully 
without answering a word flung the paper in the fire. "Are 
you mad, Sully? " said the King to his bold but faithful min- 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 269 

ister. "Yes, Sire," was the reply, " and would to God I were 
the only madman in the case." If by flinging the resolutions 
of my constituents in the fire I could have saved them the 
disgrace of having pledged themselves to their contents in 
the face of the world and of posterity, I would have hazarded 
the reproach of madness or of worse to have redeemed them 
from their ignominious vassalage. But I could not, like 
Sully, defeat their purpose by withstanding their will. If 
I could not hide their shame, I felt that it was not for me to 
aggravate or proclaim it. 

It is true, that I felt with extreme reluctance the obliga 
tion of abandoning the service which it might still have been 
in my power to render to my country during the remnant of 
the term that was left. But in estimating as highly as my 
conscience would allow my own importance as a member of 
the Senate, I could not forbear the question to myself, how 
will that body be composed, on the supposition that my own 
important self should be withdrawn from its deliberations. 
The moment the question occurred to my mind, that moment 
my resolution to resign was decided. Firm, deliberate and 
inflexibly patriotic as I knew five-sixths of that body would 
be on the trial, my extremest self-complacency could see 
nothing in the substitution of my successor for me but the 
loss of one vote to the country, and the gain of one vote to 
the opposition. If then I did abandon you, it was from the 
perfect conviction that you were too strong to need any 
assistance of mine. For be assured, if the odds had not been 
so unequivocally decisive, had the division of numbers been 
so nearly equal that in any probability a vote would have 
been of consequence in the questions involving the rights 
of the nation, highly as I reverenced the authority of my 
constituents, and bitter as would have been the cup of re 
sistance to their declared will, I would not have yielded up 



270 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

my trust until the moment when it was to be taken from my 
hands; I would have defended their interests against their 
inclinations, and incurred every possible addition to their 
resentment, to save them from the vassalage of their own de 
lusions. I did not think the occasion required this extraor 
dinary exertion of my energy, and while I was determined 
never to be instrumental of such measures as they chose to 
dictate, I thought myself fairly authorized to indulge them 
in the benefit of an immediate change in their representation. 
The event has shown that in my calculation of the firmness 
and magnanimity of the Senate I was not mistaken. The 
system of submission to British insolence and usurpation, 
which has been preached, and prayed, and resolved, and 
petitioned, and remonstrated, in this part of the country for 
the last eighteen months, finds in the Senate, thanks be to 
God, the same invincible spirit of resistance which it found 
at the last session of Congress. The will and influence of my 
constituents has had its full constitutional range, and they 
have had the best opportunity to manage their concerns in 
their own way. You have now had announced to you with 
due formality the process of resistance, which MAY BE pur 
sued against your laws. So that at least if an attempt to 
divide the Union should be made, you will have no cause to 
complain of being taken by surprise. Now if I had remained 
with you, instead of threatening insurrection and separation, 
I would only have expressed my utter abhorrence of every 
such attempt and project, however colored and from what 
cause soever intended. My sentiments with regard to the 
Union are well known to you. John Smith and Aaron Burr 
were in my view my fellow-citizens, just as if they had been 
natives of Boston; and if any native of Boston, in pursuit 
of the same end which Burr and Smith were aiming at, should 
proceed as far in its execution, I would as far as my power

extended treat him in the same manner, as I thought they 
ought to have been treated. I believe it will be better for 
you and for the whole nation to have men from this quarter 
who will prepare you for what they mean to attempt, than 
one who, feeling and believing that we have all but one com 
mon interest, could avow no other interest as representing 
this section of the Union. 

We have at this time neither ears nor tongues for anything 
that comes from the seat of government, but for what con 
cerns the embargo. Mr. Gallatin s letter to the committee, 1 
and the bill reported in conformity to it, furnish materials to 
the disaffected, which they are using with great industry. 
For my own part I consider the bill as merely a project for 
discussion, which I have no idea of seeing pass into a law. 
If it should, it is my clear opinion that it will not be executed 
in this quarter of the Union by the ordinary process. Juries, 
judges and militia will all fail to perform their parts, and the 
bayonet will be as ineffectual to execute the law as the rest. 
You know that in saying this my motive is not that of in 
timidation or of opposition, but to tell you candidly the state 
of things here. Substitute a non-intercourse with both the 
offending powers as strong and effectual as you can make it, 
but open a passage for the imprisoned vapors. A non- 
intercourse may lead to war with England or France, but 
the extension of the embargo system to the measures recom 
mended in Mr. Gallatin s letter will infallibly meet with 
direct resistance, which nothing but force will overpower. 
The project of Mr. Hillhouse s resolutions and of Mr. Gal 
latin s letter form to me the two extremes of possible policy, 
neither of which will meet the ultimate views of the legis 
lature. Of unqualified repeal, that is, submission, it seems

to me the very proposers in both houses are ashamed. From 
their British ground, they have been fairly driven. They now 
profess the will to maintain the rights of the nation, and 
confess the wrongs even of England. Meet them if you can 
upon their present professions. Guard against the surrender 
of our rights, but assert and exercise them again. Such was 
the inclination of my sentiment when Congress first met. 
Everything confirms me in it. No doubt the opposition will 
continue to every measure you may take. But it will be far 
less dangerous with a non-intercourse and a partial revival 
of commerce, than under the total interdiction of trade. 

Let me hear from you as often as your leisure and conven 
ience will permit, and believe me, &c. 

TO ORCHARD COOK 

BOSTON, I9th December, 1808. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

I have to thank you for your favor of the 4th instant, 
which I received some days since, but which various avoca 
tions of necessity have hitherto prevented me from answer 
ing. 

My opinion that the embargo must be removed, (I mean 
partially, and after the substitution of other measures 
against the French and British decrees,) becomes more and 
more confirmed from day to day. It is much more strongly 
corroborated by the letter from the Secretary of the Treasury 
to the committee of the Senate, marking out the additional 
measures necessary for carrying it into effect, than it was 
before. Indeed the appearance of that letter, and of the bill 
founded upon it, rather leads me to expect a result of a dif 
ferent kind. 

My observations in my letter to Mr. Bacon relative to 



i8os] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 273 

arming were intended to apply merely to the solitary per 
mission to merchant vessels. As to fitting out and equipping 
all the armed vessels we have, and building and equipping 
more, I remain of the same opinion I have always entertained. 
But if merchant vessels are permitted to sail armed under 
a non-intercourse system and under these belligerent de 
crees, it should be upon a plan like that of Mr. Dana s resolu 
tion, 1 by means of convoys and under cautious regulations. 

I have never heard, except from your letter, of any con 
vention of merchants in Boston agreeing to wait till 1st 
January, and no longer. I have heard of some such things 
as resolved upon by individual merchants in your district, 
but I hope the report is without foundation. As the embargo 
is unpopular, there is no doubt but that all the popularity 
seekers will drop from its support, and become the most 
violent declaimers against it. It will be the machine by 
which the turncoats will reconcile themselves to the majority. 
It seems to me that there is no measure by which the admin 
istration could lose so many of its friends in this quarter, 
as by an unyielding adherence to this particular restriction. 
The projectors of Disunion, of French war, and of British 
alliance, will take such advantage of the current as the time 
will allow. They certainly will not succeed either by the 
wisdom or the patriotism of their policy. But the inflexibility 
of the ruling party at Washington, if they do not exhibit 
some token of accommodation, will play the game into their 
hands, infinitely better than they can play it for themselves. 

I have seen a short minute of your speech on the subject, 
and hope soon to have a full report of it. We have received 
here a great plenty of speeches in pamphlets, but all, ex 
cepting that of Mr. Giles, on the other side of the question. 
When I see one gentleman delivered of a long pamphlet to

prove that all our difficulties are owing to the new importa 
tion act; another, gravely demonstrating that it is because 
we did not chastise the Spaniards for seizing the Kempers, 1 
and a third, calculating by decimal fractions and the infinite 
series, how many miles of free trade would be left us, if we 
would but live upon them as the Lazarus under the table 
of Britain, I cannot but remember a fable which I learnt 
in my spelling book, when a child, of the tradesmen who con 
sulted together on the defence of their town when it was be 
sieged. 

The blacksmith was for iron, the joiner for wood, and the 
currier insisted that for the walls of a fortress there was 
nothing like leather. We are informed of the decision on the 
first resolution reported by the Foreign Committee, and I am 
very glad that so many of the members, who made such long 
speeches against it, finished by voting for it. For although I 
know that this vote pledges no man to vote for any special 
measure of resistance, yet it is much to see that on being 
brought to the test, no man in Congress dares by his vote 
justify the outrages of Great Britain, as we see it hourly at 
tempted out of doors. The two gentlemen who voted against 
the resolution had, no doubt, reasons satisfactory to them 
selves. I am persuaded it was not that they thought we 
ought to submit to the decrees either of England or France. 

We have at last really lost our governor, who had already 
been repeatedly buried in the newspapers, and who has in 
fact been several months dying. Your letter arrived too 
late for me to take any step on the subject which you men 
tioned with him. Of the present chief magistrate 2 1 presume 
you have no doubt. 

Your reply has not been attacked in such a manner as to

need any defence. I have heard it mentioned with com 
mendation by many whose party feelings by no means ac 
cord with it. You will readily believe it agreed with my 
sentiments. I could have wished only, that the unconstitu- 
tionality of a State legislature ever requesting the representa- 
tatives of the people in Congress to use their influence this 
or that way, had been exposed a little more at large. For I 
hold these requests, which sound so much like commands, to 
be utterly inconsistent with the principles of the Constitu 
tion both of the Union and of the State, and there is danger, 
if they are not checked in time, that they may acquire a sort 
of prescriptive authority. I was very glad, therefore, to 
see you asserting your constitutional independence and re 
minding the legislature that you were not responsible to 
them. 

There is this evening a meeting of republicans friendly to 
the government in the several wards of this town. Their 
object is announced to be for the purpose of expressing their 
sentiments of adherence to the administration and its meas 
ures. This movement, I suppose, will not stand alone. But 
how it will be followed up or to what effect I do not know. 

What is the foundation of the report that the tribute or 
export duty under the British Orders of Council is aban 
doned ? If true it will somewhat change the aspect of affairs. 
Not that it can reconcile us to the other parts of these orders, 
but that it will be a great step towards their total abandon 
ment. That and a single defeat in Spain would bring down 
the tone of Mr. Canning, whose sarcastic insolence, as Mr. 
Giles so justly calls it, will I have no doubt yet be scourged 
into himself. In Spain, however, the present prospects are 
very much in their favor. 

I am, &c. 



276 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

TO EZEKIEL BACON 

BOSTON, 2ist December, 1808. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

It would certainly be more safe and prudent for me to 
imitate that reserve, which you notice as marking the com 
munications of some other friends at the present crisis. 
Thus much I may say with perfect security. 

The path of the nation is so thickly set with difficulties 
and dangers, the choice of practicable measures is confined to 
evils all of such magnitude and terror, that every man, not 
bound by the duties of a public trust to contribute in devising 
expedients to procure public relief, will most naturally shrink 
from the utterance of an opinion, what ought to be done. 
Like the Irishman on board the ship, when called to aid in 
extinguishing the fire, one feels an irresistible temptation to 
answer, "I am but a passenger." Yet so long as the reflec 
tions of my mind, or the observation I have opportunity to 
make, are acceptable to you, I shall not withhold them; for 
in truth it is a time when the passenger must lend his hand 
as much as any of the crew, and in giving to you freely my 
thoughts, crude and undigested as they are, I must add that 
you can scarcely give less confidence to them than I have in 
them myself. 

I have observed, as far as newspapers and pamphlets have 
furnished opportunity, the course of deliberation both in 
your house and in the Senate since the commencement of 
the session. Though I will not pretend to deny that I have 
my partialities of sentiments, impelling me to concur with 
one side and to differ from the other, I have anxiously sought 
from the arguments of both a footing, upon which I could 
think it possible for the nation to stand. Together with 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 277 



much crimination and recrimination, which perhaps could 
not well be avoided on either side, but which I regretted to 
see, because I thought it could answer no good purpose, and 
must naturally inflame those mutual irritations which should 
rather be soothed, I have found on both sides some leading 
ideas from which public benefit might perhaps be derived. 
The excessive precipitancy with which our New England 
federalists made their charge upon the embargo at the 
opening of the session had, I am afraid, a tendency to rouse 
the spirit of counteraction beyond the tone of cool delibera 
tion, and to prepossess too much the friends of the adminis 
tration against the measure under any modification. The 
report of the Committee of Foreign Relations (of which I 
think you were a member,) was in my opinion a production 
of uncommon excellence, but it contained a 6 concession, 
upon which the federalists seized with the convulsive instinct 
of drowning men to save themselves from the infamy to 
which their system of submission was hurrying them. The 
concession to which I refer is, that a permanent embargo 
would be an abandonment of the very right for which we 
are contending. For this primary idea they are indebted to 
yourselves. But they have turned it against the embargo 
system with some address, and with considerable effect. The 
idea is substantially true, and to my mind affords an un 
answerable argument for substituting, as speedily as possible, 
something instead of the embargo. 

The most decisive reason in my mind for this substitution 
is that which I have heretofore suggested to you. The law 
will not be executed. It will be resisted under the organized 
sanction of State authority. Already, notwithstanding the 
decision of the district judge on the constitutionality of the 
existing laws, the juries will not convict for violations against 
them. Constitutional objections will recur with tenfold 



278 THE WRITINGS OF 

greater force against the contemplated additional laws, and 
you will soon find State judges undertaking to decide these 
questions in their way. Consider the complication of the case : 
Two or three file leaders of disappointed ambition, hopeless 
of consequence under the present national union and building 
their castles of personal aggrandizement upon a separation 
and a British alliance. Under these file-leaders, an organized 
concert of banks and other monied corporations holding great 
numbers of secondary characters in a state of dependence, 
by the return of discount days, and thus commanding their 
inaction, if not their assistance. A legislature perfectly 
under their guidance. A State judiciary, of which you must 
think what I cannot say. A militia so commanded as 
at least not likely to oppose much obstacle to these views, 
and a plan long since formed to seize the first favorable op 
portunity to divide the State, and set up a New England con 
federacy. What an engine in the hands of these people is a 
system of restriction, which turns all the political humors of 
your political body inward. Gentlemen in Congress have 
said they are unwilling to suppose the case of forcible re 
sistance to the laws, but that if it should happen, they would 
use the cautery and the knife. But if you continue and ag 
gravate these laws, you must suppose the case or you will 
impose them under an erroneous view of the state of things. 
When Caesar was approaching with his army from Gaul, 
Pompey refused to suppose the case, that he would cross the 
Rubicon, and for thus refusing to suppose the case, was ut 
terly unprepared to oppose him when he came. It is easy to 
talk of using the cautery and the knife, more easy than to 
use them in reality. But it is the very necessity of using them 
which I would at almost any other hazard avoid. 

Let not the administration flatter itself with much support 
from those whom it considers as its friends. Many of them 



i3o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 279 

were friends of the summer, friends as long as favors were to 
be obtained, and the popular gale blew with them. I know 
that some of the most eminent among them are wavering, to 
say the least. I know that some of them are men, who con 
nect with all public considerations much calculation for 
themselves. The day when these will fail, will be precisely 
the day of trial. Excuse me for saying thus much. It is not 
for the purpose of exciting distrust, but to state the actual 
condition of things, upon which all useful public council must 
be founded. 

I feel the more anxious that the determination to revive 
commercial enterprise should now be taken by the govern 
ment, because it will now be a voluntary act, because all the 
objects for which the embargo was avowed to be laid have 
been obtained. We have secured all the property which was 
exposed, and we have made such use of the measure in nego 
tiation as was intended. It cannot again be used in negotia 
tion, and although it may still preserve property from cap 
ture, it can no longer save any from sudden and unexpected 
rapine. If persisted in now, I see not when the government 
can consistently abandon it hereafter. As coercion either 
against France or England I cannot believe in its efficacy. 
It affects their interests no doubt, but nations which sacrifice 
men by the hundred thousand, and treasure by the hundred 
millions in war for nothing, or worse than nothing, pay little 
attention to their real interests. It is said to have been the 
only error in the political character of John DeWitt, that he 
supposed France and England could always act upon meas 
ures according to their effect upon their interests. There can 
be no greater error than to proceed upon such calculations. 
Nine times out of ten you might more safely reverse the rule, 
and conclude that if a measure is clearly for the interest of 
the nation, the government will reject it. 



28o THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

If it be true that the British government have already 
abandoned the transit duty, they will not venture to carry 
the remainder of their Orders in Council into effect. If, 
after we open our ports, the British should take and carry in 
our ships, the resentments of the sufferers and of our people 
will fall much more upon them and less upon our own gov 
ernment, than they now do, and if they should proceed in 
their career of violence, we have yet other resources for in 
demnifying the losses which our people might sustain and 
for checking the execution of their system. One outward 
effect of our present situation is, that by securing our com 
mercial capital from the operation of the British orders, we 
take away all their practical mischief, and of course much of 
their odious character. We render the orders themselves a 
dead letter, but our own restriction takes place of all their 
prohibitions. Now if we let our merchants go to sea again, 
if the British take and confiscate their property, the passions 
as well as the reason of our people will act against them. If 
they do not capture, it must be because they will not dare to 
give their system full effect. 

I am aware of the powerful arguments which are urged for 
adhering precisely to the embargo system, and I am con 
vinced that if such should be the final result, it will be de 
cided with the best intentions. My best wishes will be with 
you, and a disposition to make every allowance for the diffi 
culties of the choice, which I know to be just and necessary. 
I am, &C. 1 

1 The fact of this correspondence became known and gave occasion to newspaper 
comment. The democratic representatives from Massachusetts have received a 
letter from Mr. John Quincy Adams, announcing to them that the embargo must 
be given up, or democracy dies forever in the east. Mr. Story and Mr. Bacon have 
taken the alarm, and are preparing to discover that this wise and powerful measure, 
* however honorable to the sages with whom it originated, as the former gentleman 
has said, is not so coercive upon foreign powers as those sages had led them to

TO WILLIAM BRANCH GILES 

BOSTON, 26th December, 1808. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

I received your very obliging favor of the iyth instant, with 
a copy of your second speech on Mr. Hillhouse s proposed 
resolution. For the notice you have taken of myself person 
ally I beg you to accept my thanks. For myself, I believe I 
shall never think Mr. Pickering s suspicions or insinuations 
against me deserving of any sentiment more earnest or active 
than contempt. 1 

believe. There are many strong indications of an approaching rebellion against 
the anti-commercial system of Confucius the Younger, in a quarter where nothing 
but the most abject submission was expected." Freeman s Journal, quoted in 
New-England Palladium, January 10, 1809. 

1 "I have designedly delayed answering your friendly and interesting letter of the 
[ ] until I could accompany the reply with some observations, I felt myself 
bound to make in your justification a few days since. Indeed my principal object in 
rising was to defend you against the most illiberal and unmerited reproaches. I 
wish I may have performed this agreeable task to your satisfaction; if I have failed 
of success, it was not for the want of good intention." William B. Giles to John 
Quincy Adams, December 9, 1808. Ms. Pickering made a speech on Hillhouse s 
resolution, November 30, in the course of which he seems to have reflected upon 
Adams. The printed report makes no mention of Adams, but the remarks directed 
against him are those printed on page 185 of the Annals of Congress. In reply 
Giles said, December 2: 

"I should not have taken the trouble of this examination, if the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. Pickering) had not availed himself of this occasion to assail the 
reputation of his late colleague (Mr. Adams) a gentleman who represented the 
State of Massachusetts with so much honor to himself and advantage to the State 
and nation; upon a point, too, in which the gentleman here present has put himself 
so clearly in the wrong, from his own showing. I had hoped, Mr. President, that 
the gentleman would have so far restrained his feelings as to have permitted this 
gentleman s retirement to have shielded him from these unmerited reproaches; 
but it now seems that no delicacy of situation can procure an exemption from the 
inveteracy of the gentleman s passions. This cruel attack has imposed upon me an 
indispensable obligation to defend this absent gentleman; and it has been principally 
this circumstance which has driven me again most reluctantly into this debate. 



282 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

It was, indeed, of importance to him to crowd upon the 
world, if he possibly could, the falsehood that the British 
Orders of Council were not among the causes of the first 
embargo act, because he had suppressed all notice of them 
in his first incendiary pamphlet, and because I had exposed 
the disingenuity of his artifice in that suppression. The fact 
is as I have publicly stated; but it is also fact, that I should 
have voted against the first embargo act, had it not been for 
the inofficial account of the Orders of Council which was 
contained in the National Intelligencer of the morning when 
the message came, and for the express recommendation from 
the executive. General Smith was chairman of the com 
mittee who reported the act, and I am persuaded that he will 
recollect the discussion we had before I agreed to the report, 
in which I expressly stated to him and the committee, that 
I did not think the two papers communicated with the 
message were sufficient to justify the measure of laying an 
embargo; but that as the accounts in the papers from Eng 
land and the information brought by Dr. Bullus were of so 
alarming a complexion, and as the President had thought fit 
to recommend the measure expressly, I presumed he must 

Sir, I can attest, and now do attest, with great pleasure, the disinterestedness and 
purity of the motives which dictated that gentleman s (Mr. Adams) late political 
conduct. As to its wisdom, that is matter of opinion, and now in a course of ex 
periment; but as to his exemption from all views of personal aggrandizement, I 
here assert that fact, upon my own knowledge and my own responsibility, as far 
as can be warranted by the most explicit and unequivocal assurances from the 
gentleman himself; given, too, under circumstances which render their sincerity 
unquestionable. It gives me great pleasure to defend this absent gentleman, not 
only on account of his innocence of these reproaches, but on account of his merits, 
his virtues, and his talents, which, in my judgment, place him on so high a ground 
as not to induce a wish, on his part, to shrink from any comparison with either of 
the five worthies of Massachusetts, of whom we have been informed by the gentle 
man (Mr. Pickering)." Annals of Congress, loth Cong., 2d Sess., 219. See also, 
Adams, Memoirs, February 2, 1808. 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 283 

have intelligence which, without being such as he could 
officially communicate, was sufficient for deciding upon this 
step as a precautionary measure. I said nearly the same 
thing in the Senate itself upon the debate there, which I 
presume is within the recollection of all the members present 
at the time, who had ears to hear any sound, but those which 
chimed with their own passions. Mr. Bradley I am sure will 
recollect it, for I remember he immediately afterwards told 
me that I had as exactly expressed his sentiments on the 
subject, as if he had spoken them himself. 1 

Indeed when I first saw in the newspapers this pretence 
raised, that the British Orders of Council were not known in 
the United States when the first embargo law passed, I 
should have been astonished at its impudence, could I have 
been astonished at anything in the workings of party spirit. 
And now, when I see members of Congress laboring with 
burthens of sophistry to prove that those orders were not 
known, because they were not officially communicated, I seek 
in vain for any line of discrimination between the principles 
of such men and those of their lowest drudges in the public 
prints. 

The course of policy which is intimated in your letter, as 
in your opinion the most advisable, corresponds in the main 
with my own sentiments. The impossibility of carrying the 
embargo laws into execution, even to the extent they have 
been hitherto, becomes more certain from day to day. Your 
argument in the first speech, that in our country all the con 
stitutional checks are upon deliberation and not upon the 
execution of the laws, is certainly true, and the distinction is 
marked with an accuracy which has not escaped the notice of 
reflecting men, even in this quarter. But there may be 
impediments to execution besides those known to the Con- 
1 See note, p. 168, supra. 



284 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

stitution. Our district court has been sitting six or seven 
weeks here and at Salem, trying breaches of the embargo 
laws, and I believe not one case has occurred in which the 
jury have found a verdict against the defendant. 

The system of non-intercourse and prohibition contained 
in the second of the three resolutions which have passed the 
House of Representatives, will for the present be less un 
popular than the embargo, if substituted in its stead. But if 
it should lead to war with Great Britain, it will be rendered 
equally odious in a very short time. Indeed, whatever the 
federalists in Congress tell you, when pushed into a corner 
about maintaining and defending the right to navigate the 
ocean, you may rely upon it, they mean practically to defend 
it only against France. Against Great Britain they will 
defend and maintain NOTHING. A thousand blustering 
speeches will never explain their principles like their conduct 
in the affair of the Chesapeake. Mr. Pickering s worthies in 
that case openly maintained Berkeley s right to search our 
national ship for deserters, and if the British government had 
not abandoned that pretension of their own accord, Pickering 
would now be telling you what the British had to say on 
their side of the question, and furnishing you with cases 
and counter-cases, and French ordinances and examples of 
French piracies, to justify the British doctrine which, he 
would tell you, to negotiate about, as he does on the subject 
of impressment and of colonial trade, all which arguments 
and authorities he would get from the same oracle to which 
he went for his ordinance of Louis I4th, (which never had 
any application to colonial trade,) in order to countenance 
the British rule of the war of 1756. I know that oracle as 
well as Mr. Pickering, probably much better. I know him 
capable of furnishing argument, authority, and precedent 
for any degree of submission to British LAWS. But for the 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 285 

defence of any right whatsoever which a British minister 
shall contest, this nation must look elsewhere. 

I say this to you, because in opening to you the principles 
of these men, I tell you the principles which will govern the 
conduct of this State. Our legislature is in their hands; at 
our next annual elections they will have the whole govern 
ment at their disposal. Far from lending any aid to the 
support of national rights against Great Britain, they will 
counteract as much as they can every measure to that effect, 
whether in peace or in war, and according to every present 
appearance they will carry the State with them. 

I need not tell you how opposite to their system my senti 
ments are, but the popular current in this State is entirely 
with them. The sources of their influence are numerous and 
powerful, and there is but one possible motive which can 
deter them from proceeding to the last extremities, in case of 
a war with England. That motive is fear. 

They are as selfish and as timid as riches can make them, 
and in the hour of danger will shrink from their own doc 
trines, leaving bolder and more desperate characters to take 
their places. 

Whatever course may be finally adopted by the national 
legislature will, I doubt not, find warm and strenuous sup 
porters in this part of the Union. But they will in all prob 
ability be the minority, both in the State and its legislature. 
You may perhaps know better than I do, the individual 
characters of weight and influence, upon whose steadiness 
reliance can be placed. All my personal and family connec 
tions, and I might almost say acquaintance, in this quarter 
are federalists, among whom those who think as I do, and 
they are many, dare not avow it. The wisdom of my late 
conduct, as you justly observe, is in a course of experiment, 
and such is the nature of the trial that here I have not a single

friend, who is willing to risk the chances with me upon the 
ultimate issue. The friends of the administration here have 
heretofore been my political adversaries, and my intercourse 
with them has naturally been not very intimate. There 
are some of them who, I have no doubt, will adhere to their 
principles, through good report and through evil report, but 
some holiday partisans will perhaps discover themselves in 
the day of difficulty. For myself so deeply do I feel that the 
question of our national independence is at stake, that as an 
individual citizen, I could ask of Heaven no higher blessing 
than that of laying down my life in the cause, if I could 
thereby contribute to its success. 
I am, &c.

I duly received your favor of the 25th ultimo, and offer

Welles and Mr. Sumner, the latter of whom is a member of 
our legislature, and in the majority. 

I have, perhaps, still greater motives for concern with re

approaching session than yourself. Disapproving as I did 
what they have already done in opposition to the policy of 
the nation, the steps which they will probably take next are 
not likely to be more suitable to my sentiments. The gen 
eral disposition of the people here, I think, is cooler, than it 
was just before the meeting of Congress, and those, whose 
object has constantly been to stimulate and inflame the pub 
lic mind, are resorting to small expedients to keep up the tone 
of temper in their followers, which is necessary for their pur- 



i8os] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 287 

poses. An attempt was made in the legislature of New 
Hampshire to pass certain violent resolutions, which failed 
by a large majority, many of the federal members voting 
against them. This measure I have some reason to suppose 
was not brought forward without consultation with head 
quarters. Its failure is a strong indication that many of the 
federalists begin to perceive the danger of the ground to 
which they are thus drawn, and may possibly moderate the 
proceedings here. Still I have no doubt they will be violent. 

I have also received your favor of the 5th instant, inclosing 
a Monitor, with your speech in Senate on the passage of the 
bill for enforcing the embargo. It will be printed here with 
the corrections from the paper itself, and I wish it may con 
tribute to reconcile some of our citizens to the measure. 

I had observed in the newspapers Mr. Lloyd s motion for 
the production of all the informal correspondence with Mr. 
Rose, but did not understand its object until your letter 
explained it. If that motion should prevail, it might perhaps 
be advisable to pass another resolution calling upon every 
member of Congress to reduce to writing and authenticate 
under the solemnity of his oath Mr. Rose s informal corre 
spondence and communications with him, and reciprocally 
his informal correspondence and communications with Mr. 
Rose. Perhaps in that case you might discover what Mr. 
Rose brought in his hand. 

You will have been informed that two instances of forcible 
violations of the embargo laws have occurred at the two 
extremities of our sea coast within this Commonwealth. 
The district court after sitting seven or eight weeks, and 
trying upwards of forty cases, has at length adjourned. Not 
one instance has occurred of a conviction by jury, and finally 
one of the jurymen is said to have declared, that he never 
would agree to convict any person under these laws, whatever 



288 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

might be the facts. The judge has been firm and decided in 
support of the laws, as far as his authority extended. 

I expect to leave this place for Washington the 25th in 
stant, to attend the Supreme Court of the United States upon 
business of a professional nature. While there I shall pay 
my respects to you in person, and in the meantime remain 
with the highest esteem yours. 1 



TO LOUISA CATHERINE ADAMS 

WASHINGTON, 5 March, 1809. 

We have at length got through the argument on the cause 
for which I came here. It was finished yesterday after having 
taken up nearly four days. The opinion of the Court will 
probably be given in the course of the week and my intention 
is to leave this place tomorrow week, which will be the 1 3th. 
I depend therefore upon the pleasure of seeing you again 
at latest in three weeks from this day. 

The oath of office was yesterday administered to the new 
President in the chamber of the Representatives. He de 
livered a short speech, which you will without doubt see in 
the newspapers before you can receive this letter. It is in 
very general terms, and was spoken in a tone of voice so low 

1 "Public affairs continue to be much perplexed, and the prospect is still very 
gloomy. The House of Representatives have voted by a large majority that the 
embargo shall come off the 4th of March; but having heretofore resolved against 
submission, they are now to provide something instead of the embargo, and what 
that shall be they cannot agree upon. 

"They talked of issuing letters of marque and reprisal, but they have now de 
cided against that. They talk of authorizing the merchants to arm their vessels, 
but neither will that succeed. They now talk of non-intercourse with France and 
England, of excluding armed vessels of all nations from our ports, of raising 15,000 
men, of borrowing ten millions of dollars. It would be passing strange if they should 
finish by doing nothing at all." To Louisa Catherine Adams, February 8, 1809. Ms. 



i8o9l JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 289 

that scarcely any part of it was heard by three-fourths of the 
audience. 

The body of the House was excessively crowded and the 
galleries were equally thronged, which gave it altogether a 
very magnificent appearance. The city was very much 
crowded with strangers, and I believe I may say without 
exaggeration that in the course of the day yesterday I saw 
more people than in the whole time I have ever been here. 

Immediately after the ceremony was performed the Presi 
dent and his lady received company at their own house. I 
paid my visit with your mamma and Mr. and Mrs. Hellen. 
It was not at the President s house, which Mr. Jefferson has 
not yet left. He was with the company who visited his suc 
cessor. 

In the evening there was a ball at Long s on the Capitol 
Hill, the house which last winter was kept by Stelle. The 
crowd there was excessive; the rooms suffocating and the 
entertainment bad. Your sister Hellen literally took me with 
her, for I should not have gone but at special invitation that 
I would attend her. The President and his family were also 
there, and also Mr. Jefferson. I had some conversation with 
him in the course of the evening, in the course of which he 
asked me whether I continued as fond of POETRY as I was in 
my youth. I told him, yes; that I did not perceive I had lost 
any of my relish for good poetry, though my taste for the 
minor poets, and particular for amatory verses, was not so 
keen as it had been when I was young. He said he was still 
fond of reading Homer, but did not take much delight in 
Virgil. 

Congress you know have broken up, after repealing par 
tially the embargo after the I5th of this month, and totally 
at the end of the next session of Congress, substituting a 
non-intercourse with France and England to commence on 



290 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

the 2Oth of May. I believe that nothing better upon the 
whole could have been done, though in Congress it does not 
suit the views of either party. My time, my reason, and my 
feelings, have been so much engross d by the business which 
brought me here that I have neither examined nor felt much 
in relation to the public. 

The Senate are to continue in session two or three days. 
Principally for the purpose of receiving nominations of the 
heads of departments. Report announces very confidently 
who they are to be, and adds there has been some perplexity 
in fixing upon them. It had been determined that Mr. 
Gallatin should be Secretary of State, Mr. R. Smith Secre 
tary of the Treasury, Mr. Hamilton of S. Carolina Secretary 
at War, and Dr. Eustis Secretary of the Navy. But it is 
understood that the nomination of Mr. Gallatin to the 
Department of State would have met with such strong op 
position in the Senate that it was doubtful whether the ap 
pointment would be confirmed. The arrangement therefore 
now is changed, and Mr. R. Smith is to be the Secretary of 
State, Mr. Gallatin remaining at the head of the Treasury. 
Dr. Eustis is certainly to be Secretary of the Navy. . . . 

I saw in the newspaper the paragraph to which I suppose 
you allude, admonishing the aspiring young federal members 
not to presume as representatives of the people to have any 
opinions of their own. But I should not have suspected 
whence it came nor whether it was directed without the in 
timation in your letter. . . .

TO LOUISA CATHERINE ADAMS 

WASHINGTON, 9 March, 1809. 

I have now finished as much of my business as I suppose 
can be done during the present session of the Court. They 
have, however, not yet decided upon any of the questions 
in the causes for which I was engaged. I shall not wait for 
their decisions certainly longer than next Wednesday, the 



On Monday morning Mr. Madison sent his nominations 
to the Senate. The heads of departments are as I wrote you 
they would be. He nominated me to go to Russia. 1 But the 
Senate took no vote on his nomination. They pass d a resolu 
tion that it was inexpedient or unnecessary in their opinion 
that a minister should be sent to Russia. Mr. Short had some 
time since been nominated by Mr. Jefferson and the nomina 
tion rejected, as was said, because the man was disliked. 2 

I believe you will not be much disappointed at the failure 
of the proposition to go to Russia. In respect to ourselves 
and to our children it would have been attended with more 
trouble than advantage. I had as little desire as expectation 
of that or any other appointment; and although I feel myself 
obliged to the President for his nomination, I shall be better 
pleased to stay at home than I should have been to go to 
Russia. 

1 See Adams, Memoirs, March 6, 1809. 

2 Jefferson had appointed William Short, minister to Russia, August 29, 1808, on 
a special and not a permanent mission. The Senate was not in session, and the 
formal nomination was not laid before it until February 24, when "with an unex 
ampled precipitancy" rejection followed, and without explanations, greatly to the 
mortification of the President. On entering office Madison nominated Adams, but 
the nomination was not acted upon. Jefferson to Short, March 8, 1809, in Writings 
of Jefferson (Ford), IX. 249; Henry Adams, History, IV. 465. 



292 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

The Senate finished their session on Tuesday. The mem 
bers of both houses are almost all gone, and the city has 
again the appearance of solitude, with the exception of the 
attendants upon the Supreme Court. It forms a contrast 
to the bustle and crowd of the inauguration day, when it is 
said there were ten thousand strangers here. This I believe, 
however, is exaggerated. . . . 

The embargo you know is to come off in part the I5th of 
this month notwithstanding Mr. Quincy s predictions. It is 
to be entirely repealed from the end of the next session of 
Congress. All the federal members but two, however, voted 
against this bill for repealing the embargo. . . . 

TO SKELTON JONES l 

BOSTON, 17 April, 1809. 
SIR: 

On my return home a few days since, after an absence of 
two months, I received your circular letter dated in August 
last, but which had been received at my house only a few 
days before my return. 

The objects of inquiry contained in your letter are so ex 
tensive, and at the same time so minute, that it would re 
quire a volume larger than that which you propose to publish 
to give you satisfactory answers relating to them. So far 
as your intention may be confined to the particular history 
of Virginia, the information which it would be in my power 
to furnish would indeed be extremely scanty. But with the

This autobiographical sketch was printed in the Portfolio, April, 1819. It again 
appeared in a pamphlet issued in 1824, with the "Letters of Tell," originally printed 
in the Baltimore American.

public affairs of the Union, of which the State of Virginia 
forms so great and distinguished a part, I have been per 
sonally conversant from the earliest period of the war of our 
Revolution to the present day. Neither my leisure nor 
patience would be sufficient for the memoirs of my own 
times, which a proper answer to the first branch of your in 
quiries would demand, and although I should very cheerfully 
communicate anything within my particular knowledge and 
which might also be within the general scope of your sub 
ject, yet I have no index which can point me specifically to 
any anecdote or event, which would be included within the 
compass of a moderate letter, and which would be appro 
priate to the work upon which you are engaged. 

Of the inquiries relating personally to myself the greater 
part are such as may be answered without great difficulty. 
If "party prejudice and political animosity" are, as they 
should be, banished from your work, you will also doubtless 
think it equally part of your duty to exclude the partialities 
of egotism, and to detect the inaccuracies so naturally flow 
ing from self-delineation. 

About the year 1650, J a man by the name of Henry Adams 
came from England with seven sons, all of whom were mar 
ried. The father and one of the sons settled in the town of 
Braintree, about ten miles from Boston, in the province of 
Massachusetts Bay. The other sons, excepting one who re 
turned to England, fixed their abode in several other parts of 
the same province. Their descendants have multiplied in the 
common proportion known to the experience of this country, 
and the name is one of those most frequently met with in 
almost every part of this commonwealth. They were orig- 

1 Henry Adams died in 1646. The genealogy of the family is outlined in the 
Works of John Adams, I. 6, and more fully in Andrew N. Adams, A Genealogical His 
tory of Henry Adams. 



294 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

inally farmers and tradesmen, and, until the controversies 
with Great Britain and the colonies arose, scarcely any of 
them had emerged from the obscurity in which those stations 
were held. Few of them before that time had possessed the 
advantages of education. The father of the late Governor 
of Massachusetts, Samuel Adams, was, I believe, the first 
of the name distinguished in any public character. He was 
a merchant of Boston, and for some time a representative 
of that town in the General Assembly of the Province. 

Samuel Adams and my father John Adams were both 
descended from the first Henry, but by two of the sons. 
They were therefore remotely connected in blood; but there 
is a very early incident in the life of each of them, which 
seems to indicate that the Spirit of Independence, which is so 
strongly marked in the history of the New England colonies 
from their first settlement, had been largely shared by the 
family from which they came, and instilled with all its ef 
ficacy into their minds. 

They were both educated at Harvard College, an institu 
tion founded in 1638, and thus coeval with the first settle 
ment of the Massachusetts colony. It is the seminary from 
which almost every man of any eminence in our history has 
issued, until the establishment so much more recent of the 
other New England colleges. 

Samuel Adams was many years older than my father. He 
received his degree of Master of Arts at Harvard College in 
1743. It was then the custom of that college, that the can 
didates for this degree should each of them propose a ques 
tion having relation to any of the sciences, in which they had 
been instructed, and assuming the affirmative or negative 
side of the proposition, profess to be prepared to defend the 
principle contained in it at the public Commencement 
against all opponents. 



i8o9l JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 295 

The question proposed by Samuel Adams was, "whether 
the people have a just right of resistance, when oppressed by 
their rulers," and the side that he asserted was the affirma 
tive. 

My father took his degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1755, and 
that of master, 1758. There has been lately published in the 
Monthly Anthology a letter written by him in the year 1755, 
and in the twentieth year of his age. 1 Written to one of his 
youthful companions, and in which the probability of the 
severance of the colonies from the mother-country, the 
causes from which that event would naturally proceed, and 
the policy by which Britain might prevent it, are all in 
dicated with the precision of prophecy. The date of this 
letter, the age at which it was written, and the standing in 
society of the writer at the time, are circumstances which 
render it remarkable. No copy of it was kept, but its con 
tents appear to have made a strong impression upon the 
person to whom it was written. He carefully preserved it 
and, dying many years afterwards, left it to his son. In his 
hands it remained until about two years ago, when, after the 
lapse of more than half a century, he sent it as a curious docu 
ment back to the writer himself. 

These anecdotes are perhaps as much within other sub 
jects of your inquiries, as within that relative to my parent 
age. They may furnish occasion for reflections to a philo 
sophical historian more interesting than any I could draw 
from the most conspicuous incident of my own life. 

My mother s name was Smith. She too is of English 
extraction, but her parents for three preceding generations 
have been natives of this country. Her father and grand 
father were clergymen. Her mother was a daughter of John 
Quincy, who was many years a member of the provincial

296 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

Legislature, several times Speaker of the House, and after 
wards member of the council. His name is mentioned in 
Hutchinson s History of Massachusetts Bay. 

I was born at Braintree, in that part of the town that is 
now incorporated by the name of Quincy. The day of my 
birth was Saturday, n July, 1767. The next day I was 
christened by the name of my great grandfather, who at the 
very moment, when I received my name, was resigning his 
own spirit into the hands of his Maker. 

In the eleventh year of my age my father took me with 
him to France, where he was sent as a joint Commissioner 
with Benjamin Franklin, and Arthur Lee, at the Court of 
Versailles. We sailed from Boston in February, 1778, and 
arrived at Bordeaux in the beginning of April of the same 
year. Before that time my education had been that of the 
common schools, interrupted by the convulsions of the 
times, but supplied by the substituted care and attention of 
both my parents. My obligations to them in this respect 
are such as gratitude can never repay to them. The impres 
sion resulting from it upon my own mind has been, that of 
a special duty incumbent upon me to pay the debt of the 
former age to that which is to succeed, and to reward my 
parents by transferring the same obligations to my children. 

After residing about eighteen months in France, where I 
was successively placed at two different schools, where I 
learned the language of the country and a little Latin, I re 
turned home with my father. Instead of three Commis 
sioners Congress found it more expedient to keep at the 
French Court a single minister. Dr. Franklin was appointed 
to that office, Mr. Lee had a separate commission for Spain, 
and my father received permission to come home. We came 
in the French frigate La Sensible, in company with the 
Chevalier de la Luzerne, who succeeded M. Gerard as the 



i8o9l JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 297 

minister of France to the United States. We arrived at Bos 
ton i August, 1779. The Massachusetts Convention for 
forming a constitution was then just about to assemble. My 
father was elected a member of that body, and drew the 
original plan of the constitution which, with some modifica 
tions made by the Convention, was afterwards adopted, 
and is still the constitution of this Commonwealth. 

In November of the same year, 1779, my father was again 
sent to Europe, with a commission for negotiating peace 
and a treaty of commerce with Great Britain, whenever 
that power should be disposed to terminate the war. He 
took me with him again, together with my younger brother 
Charles, who is since dead. We embarked at Boston in the 
same frigate, La Sensible, then upon her return to France. 
She was bound to Brest; but a few days after we sailed in a 
gale of wind she sprung a leak, which in the course of a very 
short passage became so large, that she was obliged to make 
the first land she could reach in Europe and entered the port 
of Ferrol in Spain. She was unable without a thorough re 
pair to accomplish the remainder of her voyage; we therefore 
disembarked, and travelled by land from Ferrol to Paris, 
where we arrived in January, 1780. I was here put again to 
school; but in July of the same year my father went to Hol 
land, and took us with him there. We were placed first at 
the public city school at Amsterdam, and afterwards at the 
University of Leyden. In July, 1781, Mr. Francis Dana, 
who had accompanied my father to Europe as secretary to 
the legation for negotiating peace, received a commission 
from Congress as Minister Plenipotentiary to the Empress 
of Russia, and I went with him as his private secretary. I 
was with him fourteen months at St. Petersburg, and in 
October, 1782, left him to return through Sweden, Denmark, 
Hamburg, and Bremen to Holland, where my father had 



298 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

shortly before been received as Minister Plenipotentiary 
from the United States, and had concluded the commercial 
treaty with the Republic of the United Netherlands. Upon 
this journey I employed the whole winter, passing several 
weeks at Stockholm, at Copenhagen, and at Hamburg. I 
reached The Hague in April, 1783; but my father was then 
at Paris engaged in the negotiations for peace. From April 
until July, I remained at The Hague residing with, and re 
ceiving instructions from, C. W. F. Dumas, a native of 
Switzerland, a man of letters, who had been a zealous friend 
of the American cause, and then held an office as agent for 
the United States. In July, an interval of suspension oc 
curred to the negotiations, during which my father was called 
for a short time to Amsterdam. On his return to Paris he 
took me with him. The definitive treaty of Peace was signed 
3 September, 1783, from which time till May, 1785, I was 
chiefly with my father in England, Holland, and France. 

I was now nearly eighteen years of age, and my education, 
as the above detail of my wanderings about the world will 
show, had been rather desultory than regularly systematic, 
rather calculated to make me acquainted with men than 
books. Hence it has happened that, though I was always 
of a studious turn and addicted to books beyond its bounds 
of moderation, yet my acquirements in literature and science 
have been all superficial, and I never attained a profound 
knowledge of anything. At the period of which I am now 
speaking, I became sensible of other inconveniencies, that 
might arise from longer continuance in such an unsettled 
course. By remaining much longer in Europe I saw the 
danger of an alienation from my own country, which would 
disqualify me for contentment with my condition in after 
times, and I found myself contracting sentiments, manners, 
and opinions of European growth, which I knew could not 



i8o9] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 299 

suit the regions, where I expected to pass my days, and for 
which I had retained the warmest affection. My father was 
appointed Minister to the Court of St. James, but instead 
of going with him I requested him to let me return to my 
native country, and finish my education among my own 
people. This inclination exactly concurred with his own 
wishes. I returned to America, and after six months of 
studies with a private instructor to acquire sufficient knowl 
edge of the Greek language, (which until then I had entirely 
neglected,) for admission to the university at Cambridge, I 
entered there in a class advanced almost to the end of the 
third year of the collegiate course, and, finishing with them 
the usual term of study, took the degree of Bachelor of Arts 
in July, 1787. I then immediately entered as a student at 
law in the office of Theophilus Parsons, who then resided 
at Newbury Port, and was one of the most eminent lawyers 
in this country. He is now Chief Justice of the Supreme 
Judicial Court of the Commonwealth. After three years of 
attendance, I was admitted to the bar in the courts of the 
State, and fixed my residence in the capital. 

I resided in Boston about four years. My professional 
practice was inconsiderable, my attendance at my office was 
unremitted, and having little business to occupy my time 
I employed much of it in speculations upon political subjects 
in the newspapers. In the summer of 1791, I published a 
series of papers in the Boston Centinel under the signature 
of Publicola, containing remarks upon the first part of 
Paine s Rights of Man. These papers were for some time 
attributed to my father, and for that reason excited much 
public notice both in this country and in Europe. They 
were at first very unpopular here, as containing political 
heresy and questioning the infallibility of the French Revolu 
tion. But having been republished in England, and received 



300 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

with some public commendation there, they afterwards rose 
much in the estimation of that class of literary characters 
among us, (and it is a numerous tribe,) who import their 
opinions twice a year from London and Liverpool, with the 
other articles of British manufacture. 

In April, 1793, on the first information that war between 
Great Britain and France had been declared, I published in 
the Centinel three papers under the signature of Marcellus, 
the object of which was to prove, that the duty and the in 
terest of the United States required that they should remain 
neutral to that war. These papers were published before Pres 
ident Washington s proclamation of neutrality, and when 
I had no knowledge that such a proclamation was contem 
plated. There are two political principles that form the basis 
of the system of policy best suited to the interests and the 
duties of this country. One in relation to its internal con 
cerns, UNION ", the other in respect to its intercourse with 
foreign nations, INDEPENDENCE. These principles are 
the keys to my political creed. I believed that both the 
union and the independence of the nation depended much 
upon the establishment of the system of our neutrality to 
the wars of Europe; I thought that was the critical moment 
for the establishment of this system, and there were symp 
toms of a tendency in the public opinion, which might have 
involved us immediately in the war, as allies of France. 
These were the motives that dictated the publication of the 
papers signed Marcellus, which were not much noticed at 
the time, and which have long since been forgotten. 

In the winter of 1793 and 1794 I published another series 
of papers in support of President Washington s administra 
tion, in the controversies excited by the French minister 
Genet. It was my zeal for the independence of the nation 
that again impelled me to write, and on this occasion my 



i8o9] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 301 

sentiments happened to accord so well with the prevailing 
public opinion, that these papers were received with much 
favor, and contributed to give me reputation. 

In May, 1794, I was appointed Minister Resident to the 
United Netherlands. The circumstances that led to this 
appointment were never known to me. The nomination 
was, of course, made by President Washington. I have heard 
that my name had been mentioned to him by Mr. Jefferson, 
before his retirement from the Department of State, who 
had some personal acquaintance with me while I was in 
France; I have also been told that the papers I have just 
mentioned had attracted the President s attention, and led 
him to make inquiries concerning their author. My father 
was then Vice President, but my appointment was as unex 
pected to him as to myself. 

From 1794 to 1801 I was in Europe, successively employed 
as a public minister in Holland, England and Prussia. One 
of the last acts of President Washington s administration 
was the nomination of me as Minister Plenipotentiary to the 
Court of Portugal. But while on my way from The Hague 
to Lisbon, I received a new commission which changed my 
destination to Berlin. The nomination of me to this mission 
was made by my father, and has been represented as an 
office bestowed upon me by him. It was even asserted in the 
public newspapers that I had received the separate outfit of 
these different appointments. The truth was, that on my 
first appointment in 1794, I received the outfit of a minister 
resident only 4500 dollars, that on my subsequent appoint 
ment as Minister Plenipotentiary to Lisbon I received not 
the full outfit of a Minister of that rank, but so much as with 
the 4500 dollars received in 1794 amounted to that outfit, 
that is to say 4500 dollars more, making in the whole 9000, 
the outfit that has always been allowed to every Minister 



302 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

Plenipotentiary from the first appointment of ministers 
under our present Constitution. In this respect my case, I 
believe, has been peculiar. There have, at least, been in 
stances of a full outfit allowed on a new appointment given 
to a person already abroad. And this circumstance may have 
given rise to the misrepresentation of the fact, as respected 
me. The appointment, which I held under the nomination 
of my father, subjected me to additional expenses, but never 
gave me the addition of a dollar from the public treasury 
to that which I should have been entitled to under the ap 
pointment to Lisbon. 

I resided at Berlin from November, 1797, until April, 1801, 
and during that time concluded a treaty of commerce with 
Prussia, which had been the principal object of this mission. 
I was then recalled, just before the commencement of Mr. 
Jefferson s administration. I arrived at Philadelphia in 
September, 1801. 

In 1802, I was elected a member of the Senate of Massa 
chusetts, and served in that capacity one year. I was then 
elected by the legislature of the same State a Senator of the 
United States for six years, from the 4th of March, 1803. 
In June, 1808, 1 resigned that office, and since that time have 
been in no public station. On the 6th of March last I was 
nominated by Mr, Madison for a mission to Russia, but a 
majority of the Senate being of opinion that such a mission 
was inexpedient and unnecessary, no vote was taken on the 
nomination. 

The part which I have acted while in public life has been 
naturally diversified in the detail by the different offices in 
which I have been placed. When abroad my situation was 
ministerial, my general duty was marked out by my instruc 
tions, and they were pursued to the satisfaction of the 
executive authority by which I was employed. As a member

of the State legislature, I made myself obnoxious to a great 
and powerful combination of banking interests by a strong 
but ineffectual opposition to a bank-making speculation, of 
which the time is not yet come to tell the whole truth. 

In the Senate of the United States, the part which I acted 
was that of an independent member. My fundamental prin 
ciples, as I have told you, were Union and Independence. I 
was sworn to support the Constitution of the United States, 
and I thought it my duty to support the existing adminis 
tration in every measure that my impartial judgment could 
approve. I discharged my duty to my country, but I com 
mitted the unpardonable sin against Party. The legislature 
of Massachusetts by a small majority of federal votes in 
May, 1808, elected another person to represent them from 
the expiration of my term of service, and I immediately 
resigned the remainder of that term. They had passed 
resolutions in the nature of instructions to their Senators, 
which I disapproved. I chose neither to act in conformity 
with those resolutions, nor to represent constituents, who 
had no confidence in me. It was not without a painful 
sacrifice of feeling that I withdrew from the public service 
at a moment of difficulty and danger, but when the con 
stituted organs of that country, under whom I held my sta 
tion, had discarded me for the future, and required me to 
aid them in promoting measures tending to dissolve the 
Union, and to sacrifice the independence of the nation, I was 
no representative for them. These were the immediate 
causes of my retirement from public life. 

I have already remarked, that from the unsettled and 
desultory manner in which my years of infancy were em 
ployed, I never attained a profound knowledge of any of the 
sciences. I had always however an eager relish for the pur 
suits of literature, and acquired at an early period of life a 



304 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

taste for the fine arts. In the capitals of the great European 
nations the monuments of architecture and of sculpture 
continually meet the eye, and cannot escape the attention 
even of the most careless observer. Painting, music, the 
decorations of the drama, and the elegant arts which are 
combined in its representations, have a charm to the senses 
and imagination of youth, vivid in proportion to the perfec 
tion which they naturally attain in those large cities, where 
immense multitudes of men are compressed within so small 
an extent of space. The exhibitions of excellence in all these 
faculties, which I had frequent opportunities of witnessing, 
at the time of life when they were calculated to make the 
strongest impression, gave me a taste for them, which has 
contributed to much of the enjoyment of my life. 

In the year 1806 a professorship of Rhetoric and Oratory 
was instituted at Harvard University, founded upwards of 
thirty years since by Nicholas Boylston, formerly a merchant 
of Boston. I was appointed the first professor on this founda 
tion, and have delivered a course of lectures on the subjects 
of the institution, which has been very recently completed. 1 
The duties of this office, together with the practice of law 
which since my retirement from the public service I have 
resumed, form at present the employments of my life. 

I was married at London in July, 1797, to Louisa Catherine 
Johnson, second daughter of Joshua Johnson, then Consul 
of the United States at that place. He was a native of Mary 
land, and a brother of Thomas Johnson, sometime governor 
of that State, and a distinguished patriot of the revolution. 
I have three children, all sons: George Washington, born at 
Berlin, 12 April, 1801; John, born at Boston, 4 July, 1803; 
and Charles Francis, born at Boston, 18 August, 1807.

lating personally to myself, contained in your letter. It 
would have given me pleasure to have supplied you with more 
valuable materials for your projected work. I know not 
any person to whom I could refer you for information con 
cerning me, which I myself should scruple to give. I have 
friends who would doubtless draw a flattering likeness of my 
character, and enemies who would perhaps be ready enough 
to show me in caricature. Certainly neither of them would 
know so much of me as I do, and I doubt whether either 
would form a more impartial estimate of my qualities good 
or bad. If the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, were 
told of me, the tissue of the story would be (to use an ex 
pression of Shakespeare) a mingled yarn. There would be 
found in the narrative something to commend, and enough to 
censure. As far as I know myself, the motives of my public 
conduct have always been pure and disinterested. Perhaps 
I have too much indulged the suggestions of my own judg 
ment, and paid too little deference to that of other men. 
The agency of party is so organized in our country, that the 
undertaking to pursue a course altogether independent of it 
as a public man is perhaps impracticable. However this 
may be, I do not regret having made the attempt, and 
whether in public or in private life it is my unalterable de 
termination to abide by the principles which have always 
been my guides. I am, etc. 

REVIEW OF THE "WORKS OF FISHER AMES" 

PREFACE 1 

The following papers were originally published in the Boston 
Patriot, under the title of "Review of Works of Fisher Ames, com- 

1 In January, 1809, appeared a volume, Works of Fisher Ames. Compiled by a 
Number of his Friends. Prefixed to it was a sketch of Ames life and character by 



306 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

piled by a number of his friends." This review was meant to be 
rather political than literary. Of the style and composition of his 
writings little is said it was deemed unnecessary to divert the 
attention of the reader from a discussion of the most important 
principles, to the mere structure of discourse and verbal criti 
cism and, in regard to the style, it was unnecessary to enlarge: 
Mr. Ames s biographer having characterized it with the amplifying 
and extenuating hand of friendship, but with the discernment and 
elegance of genuine taste. But the moral and political doctrines, 
which were attempted to be ushered into circulation under the 
sanction of his amiable character and respected talents, were too 
portentous to be passed over without animadversion. 

The death of Mr. Ames happened at a very momentous period 
of our national history. At a time when rights unquestionable at 
the tribunal of justice, and essential to the independence of our 
country, were attacked by all the power and all the artifice of the 
greatest naval empire upon the globe. When in defence of those 
rights the government of the Union had resorted to the only pos 
sible remedy short of war; and when a formidable party in the 
heart of the country, had taken their side in this great controversy 
with the foreign aggressor, and against their own government. So 
obviously was the justice of this cause on OUR SIDE, that although 
every measure adopted by this party, was a measure of encourage 
ment to the adversary and of annoyance to our own defenders, yet 
no living man had yet dared to pledge his stake in society to the 
direct and unqualified vindication of the British pretensions. 

John Thornton Kirkland, though not signed in the publication. The use of the 
material in the preparation of this volume indicated a political bias, the more no 
ticeable because of the course of public events since 1801. In the Boston Patriot, 
a journal of recent birth, Adams began a series of comments upon the Works. The 
first article appeared April 29, 1809, and continued in the issues of May 24, 27, 
June 3, 7, and 10. They were afterwards printed as a pamphlet: American Prin 
ciples. A Review of Works of Fisher Ames. Only the preface, prepared for the 
pamphlet and explaining the purpose of the writer, is reprinted in these volumes. 
The "Review," as the author says in his Diary, attracted but little notice; but it 
called out a reply from John Lowell, Remarks on the Hon. John Q. Adams s Review 
of Mr. Ames s Works, with some Strictures on the Views of the Author. Boston, 1809. 



i8o9] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 307 

Indirectly they were indeed justified; and while Britain was heap 
ing insolence upon injury in her treatment of this country, she 
was supported by these Americans as the exalted champion of 
liberty, the defender of oppressed nations, the last hope of the 
human race. 1 But even the addressers and reporters of the last 
Massachusetts Legislature, (anxious as they were to foment the 
spirit of subserviency to Britain, urgent as they were to unfurl 
the republican banners against the imperial standard, intrepid as 
they were to threaten and organize internal war, in aid of the 
external enemy, against our own government, struggling in de 
fence of OUR OWN CAUSE; even they) shrank from the formal jus 
tification of the British Orders of Council. 

But what no living man could be persuaded to do, the friends of 
Mr. Ames made him perform after his death. During his life-time 
he had never chosen to pledge his name to those doctrines; and 
though he had given them too much countenance in nameless 
newspaper paragraphs and essays, he had manifested a steady 
unwillingness to avow them in the face of day. But scarcely was 
he cold in his grave, when his name was doomed by his friends 
to stand before the public, responsible for the assertion, that on 
the most momentous questions at issue between Britain and us, 
she was right and we were wrong. Nor was this the only fatal 
error, promulgated in the posthumous part of this volume. The 
unreasonable veneration of everything connected with Britain, 
the excessive abhorrence of everything connected with France, 
and the mixture of scorn and contempt for his own country, which 
in his last days were at the basis of all his political opinions, were 

1 An American JUDGE [Parsons] had even talked of the impressment of British 
subjects from American merchant vessels, as being agreeable to a RIGHT claimed 
and exercised for ages, and had undertaken to justify the British King s proclama 
tion of October 16, 1807, under the pretence that it was merely an assertion of the 
nation s RIGHT to the service of its subjects in time of war. The orders in council 
too, had been defended, as merely retaliatory upon France, and although some 
straining had been manifested at the name of tribute, yet it was found that the same 
thing might be swallowed with perfect ease under the name of a transit duty. Note 
by Adams. 



3 o8 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

principles from which the most mischievous deductions naturally 
flowed. The aversion to Republics and Republican institutions, 
the bitter invective against our popular elections, the humiliating 
dogma that our liberties depended upon nothing but the British 
navy; the terror, that his children would be taken for Bonaparte s 
conscription to St. Domingo, were calculated as far as they could 
operate to spread a contagion of false opinions upon objects of the 
highest moment to the people of this country. And the danger of 
these false opinions was aggravated in proportion to the reverence 
for the talents and the respect for the personal character of the 
author, so general throughout the community. The natural and 
indissoluble connection between these opinions, and the public 
measures of those who dare not avow them, was material to be 
shewn; and the rancorous prejudices against our fellow citizens 
in other parts of the Union, the contracted basis of exclusive love, 
upon which political attachment was asserted to rest, the crude and 
undigested notions of patriotism, with the long argument to prove 
that it cannot exist in this country, nor in any Republic, were so 
many potions of poison for the public mind, which the writer of 
these papers sincerely thinks, loudly called for an antidote, before 
they should have time to circulate with all their venom, in the 
veins and arteries of the body politic. 

To defend the insulted reputation of our country, to vindicate 
from false aspersions the character of the nation, and its Re 
publican institutions, to refute the groundless charges against our 
children and our brethren of the Western and Southern States, 
to assert the real foundation upon which our independence must 
stand, to maintain its RIGHTS against the ruffian principles of the 
British cabinet, and to guard the sense and spirit of the people 
against the mistakes of fancy usurping upon the province of judg 
ment, in the estimates of political morality such were the mo 
tives which dictated these papers. 

To hold up to public view the errors of an ingenious and amiable 
man, so recently deceased, was a task, painful to the feelings of 
the writer, and which nothing but the importance of the errors, 



1809] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 309 

and the danger of the impressions they were producing upon the 
public mind, could justify. The most exceptionable principles, 
and the most important mistakes in point of fact, are quoted word 
for word from the volume itself. In no one instance however has 
a quotation been made, which in its connection with the other 
parts of the discourse would bear a different aspect, from that 
which it bears in the selection. For these wanderings of intellect, 
it is abundantly manifest upon the face of the volume, that 
Mr. Ames never meant to be responsible to the public. They 
were intended for his select and exclusive friends. They furnished 
food for that modest and generous opinion which they delight to 
entertain; that all the virtue, and all the talents, as well as all the 
wealth of the American continent, is a monopoly of their own; and 
that the rest of the people are a mere herd of Sodom, to be saved 
from the fire of Heaven only by their transcendent merits. So 
long as these maggots only crawled within the pale of the church, 
their mischief was confined to the annoyance of occasional visitors 
at the altar of the idol; but where thus ushered abroad, they might 
have taken wing and spread a plague of locusts over the land. 

It was then, an examination of the political system of these 
self-styled saviors of Sodom, which was proposed by the writer 
of the following papers. Their doctrines had never been so fully 
and explicitly avowed, by any man who had a character to pledge. 
Like the priests of Egypt, they had a revelation for the multitude, 
and a secret for the initiated. In its plenitude of perfection, their 
creed was nowhere to be found in a tangible shape. To make way 
for this mass of illumination, the real wisdom and virtue of Mr. 
Ames s best days, his public labors as a statesman, at the organiza 
tion of the federal government, his speeches openly made in the 
face of the country, the great and solid foundation of his honorable 
fame, were excluded from the compilation. Had the same prin 
ciples been scrutinized as appearing in newspaper paragraphs and 
anonymous pamphlets, the moment they were brought to the 
test they would have been universally disavowed. For the holders 
of these tenets, like the Dutch traders of Japan, whenever traffic 



3 io THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

is to be obtained by denial of their Lord, will trample upon his 
cross to disprove their religion. They have given at length their 
confusion of political faith to the world, and it was only under the 
sanction of Mr. Ames s name, that it could be properly canvassed. 

It may perhaps be thought that the conduct of these friends is 
here judged with too great severity. That in publishing these 
opinions of Mr. Ames, they are not responsible for them as their 
own; and that even the errors of the volume ought to have been 
overlooked, in consideration of the general excellence of the author, 
and the valuable matter with which they are blended. The writer 
of the Review is not insensible to the moral obligation incumbent 
upon a man of generous feelings to "hide the fault he sees," and 
to veil if possible, even the failings of a fellow citizen, distinguished 
by talents, virtues and public services. It is that obligation which 
he thinks the publishers of the volume have violated. As a free- 
born American citizen, he feels a duty to maintain the rights and 
liberties of his country, not less imperious than that of respecting 
the repose of death; especially when he perceives that a stroke is 
aimed at everything which this nation ought to hold dear, under 
the shelter of a presumption, that the sanctuary of the grave would 
shield the offence from the pursuit of justice; and that a name 
entitled to public veneration would prove a passport for corruption 
to which no man living dared to pledge his own. For it must be 
observed that the compilers have been as penurious of their own 
names, as they have been prodigal of that of their departed friend. 
The title page tells us that they are a number, but not who they 
are. The biography, a performance which in point of composition 
would do honor to any name, yet bears not that of its author; and 
the very private letters, divulged in the face of their own injunc 
tions of secrecy, are directed to nothing but asterisks. 

The writer is well aware that party spirit, will neither give him 
credit for his real motives in the publication of these papers, nor 
forbear from the imputation of others. But it is not to party 
spirit that he meant to address himself, nor to partisans that he 
holds himself amenable. Believing in the general sense and vir 
tue of his countrymen, he asks of his reader that effort of the mind 



i8o9l JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 311 

which Malebranche demands of every inquirer after truth to 
separate from the subject every prepossession not belonging to it, 
and to examine without any partial bias, the sentiments advanced 
in the volume and contested in these papers. If the principles to 
which the friends of Mr. Ames have seen fit to pledge his reputa 
tion are founded in eternal truth, to dispute them is nothing less 
than to war against Omnipotence. If they are founded in error, 
no apology will be necessary, for an attempt to arrest their progress 
at their influence at the threshold. 

Should the reader be one of those, whose admiration for the 
genius and character of Mr. Ames is a feeling in which he delights 
to indulge himself, and which he is unwilling to submit to the 
crucible of stubborn reason, he is requested to lay aside the pam 
phlet, and continue in the enjoyment of his sensations. Should 
he think it a more profitable course to test his principles before 
he carries them into action, let him examine the volume, and weigh 
the objections against a part of its contents, here advanced; after 
which he may still enjoy his admiration of the man. This I have 
no inclination to disturb. Let him, if it can afford him any grati 
fication, suspect the motives of the Reviewer. But let him renounce 
principles demonstrated to be false, and of deadly import to the 
independence and liberties of this country. 

TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

[JAMES MADISON] 

BOSTON, 30 April, 1809. 
SIR: 

The bearer of this letter, Mr. Pickman, 1 is a gentleman, 
with whom for many years I have had the pleasure of a very 
intimate acquaintance, and for whose character I have had 
every reason to entertain the highest esteem. 

Being elected a member of the House of Representatives 
of the United States to the present Congress, he is desirous of 

1 Benjamin Pickman (1763-1843). 



3 i2 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

a personal introduction to the President, and in taking the 
liberty to introduce him, I derive much satisfaction from the 
persuasion, that in his individual capacity you will find him 
an agreeable acquaintance, as in his public character he will 
be a faithful representative of the people. 

His general political opinions are those usually included 
under the denomination of federalists: his particular senti 
ments, those of federalists of the most decided cast. Yet 
widely as my own sentiments upon the recent transactions 
and discussions which have agitated the country differ from 
those which he has entertained, there is no man in whose 
integrity I should place a more perfect reliance on all occa 
sions; none upon whose candor and fairness of mind I should 
more fully rely, for the belief that he will support every meas 
ure of your administration, which his judgment shall approve. 

I cannot deny myself the pleasure which this opportunity 
affords me of offering you, sir, my congratulations upon the 
favorable change in the aspect of our public affairs, since 
your accession to the presidency, and of presenting you my 
most earnest hopes, that the just and honorable principles, 
which I have the most entire confidence will govern your 
administration, may be crowned with success beyond the 
expectation of our country s best friend, and equal to your 
own wishes. I have the honor, etc. 

TO EZEKIEL BACON 

BOSTON, 15 June, 1809. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

Of the share in the public measures, which I have had by 
my public conduct and by my well meant opinions, given at 
your request, and that of other friends devoted to the same 



i8o9] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 313 

cause, I never have been at any moment inclined to disclaim 
one title. If in the course of our late history, I have felt one 
strong regret, it was that my share in the proposition and 
support of the measures adopted was not greater. I am not 
aware, indeed, that it could have been greater, and I have 
found myself held at least to my share of responsibility for 
them. That responsibility, however, I continue to cherish, 
even in the high forms of reproach that it has assumed from 
both parties, and I take more pride than is perfectly con 
sistent with wisdom, to find Duane beginning to load me 
with the non-intercourse act, while the holy blunderbusses 
of the pulpit and the pop-guns of the Ancient and Honorable 
Artillery are battering me with a cross fire of embargo. 

I shall as little dread the reproach of having contributed 
to the non-intercourse, as I do that of having pledged every 
thing that I had to pledge upon the embargo. In the sub 
stitution, however, of the non-intercourse, as I had neither 
voice nor vote for which I was amenable to the country, I 
cannot claim in the minds of those who consider it was a 
merit, that share which ought justly to be reserved for the 
members in both houses of Congress, who actually supported 
it with both. I consider the whole series of measures, from 
the non-importation act to the proclamation of 19 April, 
both inclusive, as links of one connected system, and my 
confidence in its eventual success is daily gaining strength. 
If Mr. Randolph, or Mr. Gardenier, or any other man of 
their sense and standing in society, thinks sincerely that 
Mr. Madison s readiness in acceding to the proposals of 
Great Britain is the commencement of a new system, which 
as such they are willing to hail with approbation, I should not 
desire to disturb them in their generous feelings, but I shall 
take the liberty to persist in my opinion, that the non 
importation, the embargo, the non-intercourse, and the 



3H THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

proclamation of 19 April, 1 are all parts of one and the same 
whole, and in my approbation of them all. 

Mr. Randolph s speeches are very amusing, and very 
popular among the enemies of the administration. Among 
the federalists with us, however, there are great numbers 
who will finally support Mr. Madison, provided he does not 
quarrel with England, but on no other contingency. You will 
see that in their newspapers they are already loud in their 
support of our right to the colonial trade, and willing to 
devote the British Ministry to execration, if they should have 
been playing a false game in the late negotiation. This lan 
guage will be held, until it is ascertained whether England 
does really mean to continue substantially her system of 
blockade. If she does their execrations will vanish in smoke; 
they will again join her in denying our right to the colonial 
trade, and asserting her right of impressment, and they will 
hang like millstones on the neck of Mr. Madison s measures, 
be they what they may; in short they will act over again the 
patriotism of the last eighteen months. 

There is some uneasiness respecting these new Orders in 
Council, which are as inconsistent with the laws of nations 
and with our rights as their predecessors. The English 
newspapers pretend, and ours have copied the paragraph 
from them, that these Orders were issued with the approba 
tion of Mr. Pinkney, our minister, which surely cannot be 
possible. We are in expectation of some explanation upon 
the subject from Washington, and in the meantime hope that 
the new Orders are only a change of phase in the British 
orb, portending another speedily to ensue. 2

1809] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 315 

Perhaps they may tend to solve the difficulty which you 
suggest as having arisen, respecting the exclusion of foreign 
armed vessels from our ports and harbors. I have been long 
of opinion, that the principle of total exclusion, excepting 
under treaty stipulations, ought to be assumed as a per 
manent maxim of our government. I was for assuming it 
two years ago, and I should have been for assuming it now, 
as reported to the Senate by Mr. Giles. I know that it would 
have raised a clamor from the English faction, and that all 
the enemies of Mr. Madison would have joined in it. But 
far from thinking it ill-timed, I am afraid there will never 
be so favorable a time for setting it up as this would have 
been. However, those who are on the spot have the best 
means of judging on the expediency of the time, and I speak 
this with submission to your better opinion. If the total 
exclusion must be given up, then I should, I think, incline 
against a discrimination. Indeed, I do not see upon what 
sound principle a discrimination could be made. The orig 
inal exclusion of British armed ships was in consequence 
of the attack on the Chesapeake. It was a British offence, 
and the penalty applied to that was distinct from all the 
other measures of defence against foreign aggressions. 
Atonement having been made and accepted for that offence, 
the exclusion of their armed ships on that account ought, of 
course, to cease. But on that account it could not be applied 
to French ships. Now, although the exclusion was incor 
porated into the non-intercourse law, and thus extended to 
France as well as Britain, yet the only fair principle upon 
which it could be done was, that of having adopted the total 
exclusion, and exercising the right reserved to us against 
both belligerents. 

I have always thought that the complaints of the English 
government in regard to this partial exclusion were not with- 



316 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

out foundation. And it was on this principle, that when the 
law, upon which Mr. Jefferson s excluding Proclamation 
issued, passed in Congress, I opposed it with all my most 
fruitless zeal. I mean the law of 3 March, 1805. Under that 
law I considered the President as bound in duty to issue the 
Proclamation, and after it was issued the nation was bound 
to support it. But there never was a law enacted while I 
sat in Congress, which I more strenuously opposed, and my 
negative vote stands recorded with only three others on the 
Senate s journals. None of those who have since abused Mr. 
Jefferson for issuing his Proclamation as that law required, 
would then join me in voting against the law. 

If we exclude the armed vessels of France, while we admit 
those of England, we shall certainly have the same com 
plaints from France that England made against the Proc 
lamation, and we shall not have an attack like that on the 
Chesapeake to plead in answer. Perhaps you will say, we 
shall discriminate by leaving the interdict upon trade, and 
why not by the exclusion of armed ships? Because trade is 
an affair of peace, and the admission or exclusion of armed 
ships operates peculiarly upon the state of war. In one case 
you are dealing as with commercial nations, in the other you 
are dealing as with belligerents. I have not room to unfold 
this idea in all its bearings, but I am sure you will under 
stand it on this hint. If it should not meet your approbation 
I am sure it will have your candid consideration. I am, etc.

but this moment, and very sincerely thank you for the in 
timations contained in it. The publications to which you 
allude I believe will soon be concluded, perhaps this or the 
next week. 1 They were not commenced without much de 
liberation, nor without a full estimate of the spirit which 
they would kindle up respecting their author, and of the 
power over the public mind, which that spirit would possess. 
Of the importance of the facts which they have disclosed and 
are disclosing, not merely to the reputation of the writer, but 
to the interests of this nation and to its welfare, it is probable 
the men of other times will be better judges than any of the 
present public. My own judgment of them must of course 
be partial, for there seems to me to be more true history in 
them, than in all the collections of our Historical Society. 
There is indeed more true history in them, than it may suit 
the feelings of any description of our politicians and states 
men to have told. But as the historian is as much out of the

the nature of the public mind. If you give it roast meat every day it cloys, and how 
many men have written too much. Aware of the delicacy of a suggestion of this 
nature I cannot withhold it. An interest in his fame is a self-justification. Wishing

have been in writing the tale of his times, he neither has 
taken, nor will take, the thermometer of popular feeling at 
the present moment for a guide respecting the continuance 
or cessation of his writings. Were my own inclined to con 
sult the prudential considerations of this hour more than 
his, he would certainly decide according to his own judgment 
and not according to mine. The particular subject upon 
which the correspondence commenced has, I believe, been 
closed as to the writing, and will be printed within the time 
I have mentioned; and nothing further is intended for the 
present. 

Yes, I believe with you that the first of qualities for a 
great statesman is to be honest. And if it were possible that 
this opinion were an error, I should rather carry it with me 
to my grave, than to believe that a man cannot be a states 
man without being dishonest. I have, and must have, con 
fidence in the possible virtue of human nature; and although 
in entertaining this idea, a man must, and will sometimes, 
be disappointed, yet if it is coupled with a sound judgment 
and close observation, I believe he could make fewer great 
mistakes, than one whose principle is the universal rascality 
of the species. When Alexander swallowed the medicine 
offered him by Philip his physician, after an anonymous 
warning that Philip had been bribed to poison him, Alex 
ander might have been mistaken. He staked his life upon 
the belief in Philip s honesty. It was the most heroic action 
of his life. But its heroism consists in his confidence in 
human virtue, combined with the accuracy of his judgment 
in the individual application of it. Had Philip really been 
the corrupt villain, and administered poison, Alexander s 
confidence would have been as noble, but the event would 
have proved his judgment in that instance incorrect. All

men profess honesty as long as they can. To believe all men 
honest, would be folly. To believe none so, is something 
worse. 

I rejoice that your conviction in the honesty of Mr. 
Madison has been confirmed by the opportunity you now 
have of ascertaining it conclusively. I have entertained that 
confidence in him at a time when, if I had lent an ear to 
prejudices, they would have led at least to suspicion; and 
although if the event had proved me mistaken in my con 
fidence, I should not have renounced my theory of human 
nature, I should certainly have felt conscious that in the 
application of my principle I had committed an error of 
judgment. I hope you will not conclude from this reasoning 
that I mean to make Mr. Madison s honesty prove me a 
hero. I did not stake my life upon the issue. 

What I did stake was enough to make me feel no slight 
gratification in the daily accumulating public evidence, that 
I was not mistaken. And whether I live long enough to sur 
vive the passions, and prejudices, and personal enmities 
which my conduct and the course of events have brought 
upon me or not, I have no fear that either my father or my 
self will leave to after ages a name, at which my children will 
ever have occasion to blush. 

Our legislature have risen after a short session, in which 
nothing of any consequence has been done. It has r indeed, 
been a session of much profession and little action. The 
principal occupation has been party management to claim 
the victory in the midst of a retreat. Very patriotic pro 
fessions have been made and echoed, and the principle of 
confining offices to one party has been reprobated in theory, 
as much as it is followed in practice. I have no doubt that 
overtures of a very conciliatory nature have been made to 
Mr. Madison from the predominating party here, and I

presume you know more of them than I can inform you. 
Perhaps you also know that among his and your friends, there 
is some uneasiness under the apprehension of a coalition 
from which, in respect to party views, they might be the 
sufferers. Of all this I have heard a little, but it being a 
subject in which I have no inclination to meddle, I have felt 
not much interest in the purposes of either side. 

The readiness with which the propositions from England 
were received by Mr. Madison has given universal satisfac 
tion in this quarter, and rendered the commencement of his 
administration extremely popular. There is a wish, feebly 
intimated rather than directly asserted from a certain quar 
ter, that measures hostile to France might be adopted. I 
observe the same thing in the congressional manceuvering 
at Washington, but I hope it will not be suffered to prevail. 
Senseless and cruel as the conduct of France towards this 
country has been, I still wish that a war with her may be 
avoided. As Great Britain is now upon her good behavior, 
I cherish a slight hope that Mr. Madison will yet signalize 
his administration by obtaining from her justice and our 
rights. At any rate that we shall escape a war with her, and 
yet surrender nothing essential. But no alliance with the 
British lion; no common cause against the Corsican! 

If in the occasional moments of leisure which the duties of 
your office may allow, you can now and then spare a line of 
communication to me, I shall esteem it as a favor, and will 
promise not to burthen you with any more such length of 
epistle in return. I am, etc. 

P. S. 26 June. The subject of the negotiation with France 
in 1800 is, as I have mentioned, concluded in my father s 
correspondence. But he proposes to continue immediately 
the publication of letters upon a different subject, the peace 
of 1783.

COMMISSION 

JAMES MADISON, President of the United States of America, 
To JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, GREETING: 

Reposing special Trust and Confidence in your Integrity, pru 
dence and Ability, I have nominated and by and with the advice 
and consent of the Senate, appointed you the said John Quincy 
Adams, Minister Plenipotentiary for the United States of America, 
at the Court of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia; 
authorizing you hereby to do and perform all such matters and 
things as to the said place or office doth appertain, or as may be 
duly given you in charge hereafter; and the said Office to hold 
and exercise during the pleasure of the President of the United 
States; for the time being. 

IN TESTIMONY Whereof, I have caused the Seal of the 
United States to be hereunto affixed. 

Given under my hand at the City of Washington the Twenty- 
Seventh day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand Eight 

*"I think the nomination to St. Petersburg will be made this session." On 
June 26, the President sent to the Senate a message nominating Adams to be 
minister plenipotentiary of the United States to the court of St. Petersburg, with 
documents showing the fitness of the opportunity. American State Papers, Foreign 
Relations, III. 298. The nomination was confirmed the next day by a vote of 
nineteen to seven. 

"So far as your public sentiments and conduct may have an influence on the 
public mind, your friends would certainly have preferred that the theater of your 
employments should have been on American ground. A mission to the Court of 
St. Petersburg is, to a man of active talents, somewhat like an honorable exile; in 
which point of view I hear it has been remarked by your old friend Col. P[ickering], 
that he believed upon the whole the best thing that could be done with you was 
to send you out of the country. Though your friends will not probably accede 
to the position that it was the best thing, yet they will very readily agree that it was 
a very good thing." Ezekiel Bacon to John Quincy Adams, June 29, 1809. Ms.

JAMES MADISON. 
By the President. 
R. SMITH, 

Secretary of State. 

SECRETARY OF STATE TO WILLIAM SHORT 1 

Department of State, September 8th, 1808. 
SIR: 

The President having thought it expedient for the interests of 
the United States that a minister plenipotentiary should be sent 

1 In place of special instructions, Adams was given copies of what had been given 
to Short and Armstrong. The essential parts of the Armstrong dispatch follow: 

"The rein given by Great Britain thro the arbitrary decisions of her Admiralty 
Courts, to the cruizers against our commerce, has produced already heavy losses 
to our merchants and a very general indignation throughout the nation. You 
will have observed the notice taken of the British conduct in the message of the 
President to Congress at the opening of the session. I now transmit a copy of a 
special message on the subject, with copies of sundry memorials from our merchants, 
and of diplomatic documents, explaining the extent of the evil, and the grounds of 
our remonstrances against it; to which I have thought it not improper to add a 
printed examination of the doctrine asserted by G. Britain as the basis of her war 
fare on neutral commerce. These materials will put you in possession of the extent 
of the neutral right claimed by the United States, of the reasoning by which it is 
maintained, and of the great interest they have in maintaining it. 

"What effect the communications made to Congress may have on their counsels; 
cannot yet be pronounced. The subject is expected to undergo an early and very 
serious consideration, and will probably end in some measures addressed to the 
interest of Great Britain; unless a hope should be indulged that a voluntary ad 
justment with her will render them unnecessary, or that the course and issue of 
the contest in Europe may supply a remedy. 

"In this state of things, the President reflecting on the interest and the way of 
thinking which has prevailed among all the great powers of Europe, as well those 
allied as those at war with Great Britain concerning the maritime rights of neu 
trality, conceives that it may be useful to enter into certain explanations, with the 
principal at least of those powers, particularly the two Emperors of France and of 
Russia, with a view to promote an incorporation of the most important of those 
rights into a Treaty of peace. 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 323 

to the Emperor of Russia, he is desirous of availing them of your 
services on the occasion. You will accordingly herewith receive a 
commission and a letter of credence to the Emperor. 

"You are accordingly authorized and instructed to take an early occasion of 
intimating to the French government how much the United States have this object 
at heart, and how much confidence they have in the efficacy of such an arrange 
ment under such auspices. 

With respect to the particular rights to be placed under the guaranty of a 
general treaty of peace, it will naturally occur that the one having the first place 
in the wishes of the United States is that which is at present violated by the British 
principle subjecting to capture every trade opened by a belligerent to a neutral 
nation during war, and in which both the United States as a neutral and France as 
a belligerent nation have so deep an interest. It will be recollected that this right 
stands foremost in the list comprized in the two plans of armed neutrality in 1780 
and 1800. In general it is to be understood that the United States are friendly to 
the principles of those conventions, and would see with pleasure all of them effec 
tually and permanently recognized as principles of the established law of nations. 
The ideas of this government would extend even further in relation at least to 
contraband of war; the list of which as retained by those conventions, and as limited 
by the generality of modern treaties, is a source and a pretext for much vexation 
to the commerce of neutrals, whilst it is of little real importance to the belligerent 
parties. The reason is obvious. In the present state of the arts throughout Europe, 
every nation possesses, or may easily possess within itself the faculty of supplying 
all the ordinary munitions of war. Originally the case was different, and for that 
reason only it would seem that the articles in question were placed on the contra 
band list. The articles which alone fall within the original reason, are naval stores; 
and if these are expunged from the list of contraband, it is manifest that an abolition 
of the list altogether would be a change in the law of nations, to which little objec 
tion ought to be made. 

"On the subject of free ships free goods/ the United States cannot with the 
same consistency, as some other nations maintain the principle as already a part 
of the law of nations; having on one occasion admitted, and on another stipulated 
the contrary. They have however invariably maintained the utility of the principle, 
and whilst as a pacific and commercial nation they have as great an interest in the 
due establishment of it, as any nation whatever; they may with perfect consistency 
promote such an extension of neutral rights. The northern powers, Russia among 
the rest, having fluctuated in their conduct, may also be under some restraints on 
this subject. Still they may be ready to renew their concurrence in voluntary and 
conventional arrangements for giving validity to the principle, and in drawing 
Great Britain into them. 

"Russia may also feel respect for the footing on which her explanatory article 



324 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

You will see in the latter, a copy of which is furnished, the gen 
eral purposes of your mission. It has been invited by the friend- 

with Great Britain of October 20, 1801, has placed the commerce of neutrals with 
belligerent colonies. Even with that limitation, provided it be applied not to the 
right itself asserted by the convention of June, 1801, but to the exercise of the right, 
the commerce of neutrals would be on a footing acceptable to the United States. 
And although it might be less so to France, it still deserves her consideration 
whether, such a provision, which secures in time of war all the necessary supplies 
of her colonies, and to her own markets, the necessary colonial productions, ought 
not to be embraced in case Russia should refuse to cooperate for a more complete 
provision. It is to be hoped however, that she will resume the principle in the 
latitude given to it in the convention itself of June, 1801, and that the joint influ 
ence of Russia and France will be effectual in engaging the concurrence of Great 
Britain and the other maritime powers of Europe. 

"The only remaining subject, requiring notice is that of convoys. The neutral 
claim on this subject was not included in the armed neutrality of 1780. Altho* the 
United States cannot but befriend it as favorable to the security and interest of 
neutral commerce, yet the plausible objections made to the claim by Great Britain 
in its indefinite extent, and her probable inflexibility in the objections, may render 
it expedient to substitute the modifications already admitted by Russia in the 
treaty of June, 1801. With such modifications, the right seems to be sufficiently 
valuable to deserve a place in a general provision for neutral rights. 

Having given this explanation of our views on this occasion, it will be necessary 
to say something with respect to a participation of the United States in the means 
of giving them effect. Such a participation may refer ist, to a Congress for making 
peace; 2d, to the guaranty of neutral rights which a treaty of peace may provide. 
As to the first it may happen that the occasion will be over before arrangements 
could be made for giving the United States a representation in such a Congress. 
But on a contrary supposition it is not seen that there would be much advantage 
or propriety in the measure whilst it would expose us to all the snares which might 
be laid for entangling us in the politics of Europe, and in the plans of those who 
may predominate in the negotiations. Should any disposition therefore be dis 
covered to invite the United States into the scene, it will be proper for you by polite 
and friendly explanations to repress it. As to the second point, it will be still more 
important not to bind the United States to any participation in such a guaranty, 
and consequently to avoid raising any expectation, that they will accede to an ar- , 
tide for the purpose, if an opportunity of so doing should be reserved to neutral 
nations not parties to the Treaty. 

" Notwithstanding this refusal of the United States to become parties to the nego 
tiation and stipulation of a guaranty of neutral rights, the deep interest which they 
have therein, will justify the solicitude which you may express on the subject;

ship, not to say partiality of the Emperor towards the United 
States, expressed in letters from him to the President, as well as 
otherwise manifested by suggestions thro* official channels that 
such a mission would be agreeable to him; by the occasion pre 
sented in the notification to the United States as a neutral nation, 
of the late war into which his Imperial Majesty had entered; lastly, 
by the liberal principles and policy entertained by him with re 
spect to the rights of the sea, and by the influence which the 
high station of Russia, and her peculiar bearing on the pre 
dominant powers of Europe, must have on questions of univer 
sal interest not only incident to the course of the war, but 
which may enter into the discussions and arrangements for termi 
nating it. 

It will be your duty therefore to cultivate the good dispositions 
of the Emperor on every point interesting to the United States by 
assuring him of their sensibility to all the marks of his friendship, 
and of the value they place on it; by explaining to him the pacific 
and just principles which form the basis of their policy, by tracing 
the conformity of the rules of public law between belligerents and 
neutrals recognized by the United States, to those maintained by 
his Imperial Majesty, as far as this conformity may extend, and 
by pointing out the true grounds on which variations in those of 
the United States, may rest. You will be enabled to enter into 
these explanations by the documents communicated from time to 
time to Congress, copies of which you will possess, and by the ac 
companying copy of a letter of the I4th day of March, 1806, to 

and the weight which the sentiments and interest of so rising a power Tnust have, 
more particularly with Great Britain, will justify the species of interposition which 
you are authorized to use. This may be strengthened also by intimating that 
altho* the United States, taking into view their distance and abstraction from the 
powers of Europe, and the peculiar structure of their government, are unwilling 
to enter into any specific engagements, particularly of a military nature, yet that 
they could not see with indifference a violation of a system of rights so precious to 
them, and that they might not improbably avail themselves of the means which 
they possess in a peculiar degree, of making it the interest of commercial and manu 
facturing nations, to respect such a system." Secretary of State to John Armstrong, 
March 14, 1806. Ms. 



326 THE WRITINGS OF [1808 

General Armstrong, a copy of which was transmitted to our consul 
at St. Petersburg. 

It being impossible to know what the future conduct of the bel 
ligerent powers may be towards neutrals, or to foresee what par 
ticular policy in relation to this continent may find its way into a 
general pacification, it cannot be unimportant, to have, in a party 
so powerful and influential as Russia, a good will and wakeful 
attention to the just rights, and interests of the United States, as 
these may be involved in the course of events. To secure this 
advantage being the primary object of your mission, these general 
instructions will for the present be sufficient. 

As there may, however, be a desire on the part of the Emperor 
to enter into explanatory or declaratory stipulations on points 
affecting the relations of belligerent with neutral powers, or into 
conventional regulations for the commerce between the two coun 
tries, an early opportunity will be taken to forward such further 
instructions as will explain the views of the President in these 
respects. 

In the mean time, you will let the Russian government under 
stand that the existing laws of the United States which place 
Russia on the footing of the most favored nation, entitle their 
citizens to a correspondent footing in the commerce of that Em 
pire; and it will be proper for you, availing yourself of the informa 
tion and experience of Mr. Harris, to promote such changes in 
existing regulations as may have that tendency, or be otherwise 
favorable to the commerce of the United States. 

You will find no difficulty in presenting the embargo in lights, 
which will satisfy his Imperial Majesty that it was prescribed by 
the circumstances in which the commerce of the United States was 
placed by the destructive edicts of Great Britain and France; and 
that as the efficacy of the measure would be frustrated by excep 
tions in reference to more just and friendly nations, they could 
not be made even in behalf of our commerce with Russia, who is 
seen with satisfaction to have avoided those belligerent examples, 
by limiting her retaliating decree of [ ] to cases, within the 



i8o8] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 327 

uncontested authority of every nation. Whether in this limited 
interdiction his Imperial Majesty has consulted the best interests 
of his subjects, as well as exercised no more than a rightful au 
thority, is a question which belongs to himself alone to decide. 

As it will best consist with other public arrangements, that you 
pass thro France on your way to St. Petersburg, the dispatches 
for our minister at Paris will be committed to your charge. They 
will inform him of your destination, leaving to yourself, the more 
particular disclosures which it may be useful for him to receive. 
As the relations which may then subsist between that country 
and Russia, cannot now be known, it will rest with your own dis 
cretion, enlightened by information on the spot, to regulate the 
degree of reserve as to your mission, by the use which the French 
government might be likely to make of any knowledge gained on 
the subject. Our minister in London will also be made acquainted 
with your mission, and instructed to observe a like course with 
respect to the British government. 

You will find at St. Petersburg, in the character of consul of the 
United States Mr. Levett Harris, who is considered as standing 
well there, and has received more than ordinary marks of attention 
even from the Emperor himself. I recommend him to your regard, 
confiding that he will merit it, and that his good dispositions and 
acquired information will be useful to you. A letter which I have 
written to him is herewith inclosed, as also copies of his late let 
ters to this Department, and of certain communications from the 
Russian government made through him. I leave the letter to be 
sealed after your perusal of it. In attending to the communication 
relative to Sweden, you will of course restrict yourself to expres 
sions of mere amity and civility. The tenor of your observations 
on the ordinance relating to trade between Russian and British 
ports, is suggested by those in the above paragraph. 

The President will expect from you the most exact and ample 
communications, for which opportunities may be found. The 
cypher with which you are furnished, being the same with that of 
our minister at London, you will be able to correspond confiden- 



328 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

tially with him as far as may be useful. You will do well to obtain 
at Paris, a copy of General Armstrong s cypher also, for the like 
purpose. The advantage of corresponding with those ministers, 
in cyphers known to this Department, is, that in their transmitting 
hither information received from you, the labor and delay of 
translating it into another cypher may be avoided. I beg leave to 
intimate also the conveniency of using always in your correspond 
ence, with this Department at least, good paper, of the same size, 
and with outward margins for guarding the text, and inward ones 
for the sake of binding the letters, and thereby having a record 
free from the trouble and the errors of transcribing. . . .* 

TO ROBERT SMITH 

BOSTON, 5 July, 1809. 
SIR: 

I had the honor yesterday of receiving your letter of 29th 
ultimo, inclosing a commission as minister plenipotentiary 

1 "I observe that nothing is said in the instructions, either to Mr. Short or to me, 
respecting the presents, which have heretofore been considered at the Russian Court, 
as indispensable, on the admission of a foreign minister. 

"A refusal on the part of Congress under the Confederation, to comply with this 
custom, was the occasion of Mr. Dana s returning home from St. Petersburg, with 
out being received as a public minister. Whether the Russian Court has in this 
instance determined to waive an usage, which I believe is still maintained in others, 
or whether there has been any understanding between the two governments upon 
the subject, I can only conjecture; but as the expense of making such presents is 
not included in the number of those which I am authorized to incur, without specific 
and further authority, I should have been happy, were it possible, to have received 
the President s directions in this respect before my departure." To the Secretary 
of State, July 27, 1809. Ms. See John Adams to Benjamin Rush, January 21, 1810, 
in Works of John Adams, IX. 626. "Under an impression that presents on such 
occasions are not required, your instructions have not contemplated such a state 
of things. If, however, you should find that at the Russian Court they are cus 
tomary and are expected, I am directed by the President to inform you that you 
are to consider yourself authorized to make them." Secretary of State to John Quincy 
Adams, October 23, 1809. Ms.

to the Emperor of Russia. In requesting you, sir, to offer 
to the President my respectful acknowledgments for the ex 
pression of his wish that this appointment might be agreeable 
to me, I cannot but add the request, that you would accept 
the like acknowledgments to yourself, for the obliging man 
ner in which you have communicated this information. 

Considerations of a powerful nature, arising from my per 
sonal circumstances and those of my family, would at this 
time restrain me from leaving for so distant a region, and so 
incertain a period of absence, the land of my parents and of 
my children; and in consulting the operations of my own 
judgment, a doubt might perhaps remain, whether any 
service it may be in my power to render my country on this 
mission, can outweigh that which I must abandon in my 
present relations with society. Yet a firm conviction, that 
the first object of the President s administration is the wel 
fare of the whole Union, and an ardent desire to contribute 
whatever aid I can give to a purpose which has all the wishes 
of my heart, reconcile me to the station where the regular 
authority of the country has deemed it best to place me, 
and induce my acceptance of the office. 1 

From the situation of my private affairs, and of my con 
nection with the University in this neighborhood, which 
must now be dissolved, 2 I do not think I could name an 
earlier day than the I5th of August, as that on which I could 
leave the United States. But from that time the period of

your direction, I cannot forbear requesting you to accept the assurance that, 
whether at home or abroad, under every circumstance and situation of life, I shall 
never cease to feel the warmest attachment to the interests and welfare of that 
seminary, under whose tutelary guidance it will ever be my pride to have been a 
pupil and an instructor." To the President, etc., of Harvard University, July 7, 1809.

my departure must depend upon the opportunities of pas 
sage which may occur directly to Russia, or at least to the 
north of Europe. 

A number of applications which have already been made 
for the situation of my secretary on this mission leads me 
to the inquiry, what provision in this respect is contemplated 
by the President, and whether the choice of a secretary is 
left with me. I shall wait your instructions in this and other 
respects, and remain in the mean time with perfect respect, 
sir, etc. 

TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 

[ROBERT SMITH] 

BOSTON, 7 July, 1809, 
SIR: 

When I had the honor of writing you on the 5th instant, 
I had not the opportunity of obtaining information which 
I have since received, respecting the earliness of the season 
when the navigation of the Baltic is closed, nor of knowing 
that I could obtain at such time as would suit my own con 
venience of departure, during the continuance of the regular 
season, an opportunity for a passage direct to St. Peters 
burg. 

Since then, I have been informed by Mr. William Gray, 
of this town, that he has a vessel with suitable accommoda 
tions, which he would readily dispatch for that place, at 
any time until the last of this month. But that after that 
time, the navigation becomes too hazardous to be attempted. 

Under these circumstances I have determined, if it meets 
with the President s approbation, to accelerate the period of 
my departure, and calculating that I may receive an answer 
to this by the 2Oth of this present month, will be ready to 



1809] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 331 

sail by the 25th, if honored before that time with your in 
structions and orders to that effect. 1 

I have engaged to take with me, if the choice be left to me, 
my nephew, William Steuben Smith, 2 as my private secre 
tary. I have received several applications from young 
gentlemen of the most respectable character and connections 
to accompany me under the protection of the legation, and 
in the capacity of secretaries, but with the expectation of 
providing altogether for their own expenses, and to occasion 
no charge to the government. I have consented on these 
terms to take three persons. The son of General Smith of 
Baltimore, 3 a son of Mr. William Gray, 4 of this town, and 
Mr. Alexander Hill Everett, also of this town. They are all 
of them young men of perfectly fair characters, all personally 
known to me; and although I have no expectation of having 
much employment for them as secretaries, a belief that their 
object in this pursuit is highly laudable in itself, and may in 
its consequences be useful to the country, has induced me 
to promise a compliance with their wishes, unless the Presi 
dent, or you, sir, should perceive some objection to it, of 
which I am not aware. I have thought it, however, my duty 
not to make any positive engagement with them, without 

1 On July 24 the Secretary of State wrote that he feared Adams would "not now 
be able to proceed to any port in Russia in a private vessel;" and on the 3ist in 
formed him that the frigate Essex had been ordered to Boston to take him and his 
family to Russia, "as it is presumed that the late change in the aspect of our affairs 
with Great Britain, or some other consideration, may induce you to prefer going 
out in a public rather than a private ship." This second letter reached Adams in 
St. Petersburg late in December. 

2 Son of William Stephens Smith. May 2, 1810, his commission as secretary of 
legation was issued, and a second on March 4, 1811. 

3 John Spear Smith, son of Samuel Smith. He sailed in the Pallas for Christian- 
sand, reaching that port two days after Adams had left it, so he came to St. Peters 
burg through Sweden. 

4 Francis Galley Gray (1790-1856).

of inquiring whether there would be on the part of the gov 
ernment any objection to this arrangement. I trust it need 
not be added that as their purpose is to occasion no expense 
to the government, so the only advantage that I am to de 
rive from having them attached to the legation will be the 
pleasure of their company, and such aid in the performance of 
a private secretary s duties as they shall voluntarily give. 
I have the honor, etc. 



TO WILLIAM EUSTIS 

BOSTON, 1 6 July, 1809. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

I have received your favor of the 6th instant, which I wish 
very much to answer at considerable length, but am obliged 
to deny myself that pleasure in consideration of your time 
and my own. 

I have determined to go. Inclining myself, to the belief, 
that home and a private station was a position in which I 
could have served the country and aided Mr. Madison s 
administration, (which is the same thing) more usefully 
than upon this mission, I have yet acquiesced in the judg 
ment of those to whom the Constitution has left it, and who 
have thought best to place me abroad. I could not be in 
sensible to the spontaneous and unsolicited token of the 
President s confidence, manifested in the nomination at the 
commencement of his administration, nor was it consistent 
with my sense of my own duties, to meet that confidence 
with a temper of hesitation or of coolness in regard to the 
mode, or the place where, he conceived I might be useful to 
the cause. 



i8o9] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 333 

I shall hope to have the pleasure and benefit of your pri 
vate correspondence while abroad. But you must let me 
know whether I can write to you or to anybody else, any 
thing but what may appear in the newspapers. I shall cer 
tainly have nothing to reserve from the President or the 
Secretary of State, and if it is understood that nothing 
is to be written, but such matter as may be yielded to a 
call for papers, I shall conform to such intention as well 
as I can. 

I have received from Mr. Daschkoff 1 a very polite letter, 
expressing his pleasure at the mission to Russia, and pro 
posing, if I conveniently could, to meet him at New York 
previous to my departure. Though it would have given me 
much pleasure to have made an acquaintance with him, I 
had not time enough for such a journey, and felt myself 
obliged to wait here for my final orders, and so I answered 
him. 

The aspect of affairs with France is less promising than 
could be wished. Although we wish to deal in fairness and 
equal justice with both belligerents, their conduct towards 
us will follow the character of their own good or ill success. 
Bonaparte appears to have at present as much upon his 
hands as he needs, and what he gains in Germany, he loses, it 
would seem, in Spain and Portugal, if not in Italy. He has 
stretched the bowstring till it cracks. He may as well re 
serve his resentments against us, and I hope he will until he 
shall see cause to forget them. I am, etc. 2

States. 

2 Two days after this letter was written, intelligence was received at Boston, by 
way of Halifax, that the British government had disavowed the arrangement made 
by Mr. Erskine in April, and that Russia had declared war against Austria. 



334 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

TO THOMAS BOYLSTON ADAMS 

At sea, 7 August, 1809. Monday. 
MY DEAR BROTHER: 



I expect that these lectures l will be handled without 
mercy by the critics on both sides the water. Besides all 
their real defects, which I know to be neither few nor small, 
there will be the national malignity at work in Great Britain, 
and the political malignity at work in America, with an in 
dustry and sagacity fully proportioned to their virulence. 
At whatever period they should have appeared, they never 
could have escaped the severest ordeal. But I regret that 
I had not the time to prepare them better for their conflict 
with the world. 

I anticipate no benefit to my own reputation from them, 
but if anything, the contrary. Yet I feel an undoubting con 
fidence that they will do good. They will excite the genius, 
stimulate the literary ambition, and improve the taste of 
the rising generation. They will probably lead to something 
better of the same kind, and the very keenness with which 
they will be assailed, may contribute to aid the cause of liter 
ature in America. If they should survive the first fire of 
their allied adversaries, and I have the leisure which I 
promise myself, they may be much improved in a future 
edition. To live in the memory of mankind by college lec 
tures is not the aim of a very soaring ambition, but I have 
no reason to look for any higher glory from posterity, and 
with that I ought to be content, if he who rules the destinies

i8o9] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 335 

of men has so decreed. At least may he never suffer me to 
wish for any other glory, than that of doing good. 

In the valedictory part of my closing lecture, when I 
called the students my unfailing friends, and supposed the 
possibility of an occasion in their future lives, upon which 
friendship might deem it prudent to desert them, I had a 
meaning the whole of which they probably did not under 
stand, but which others concerned did understand full well. 
I had seen the occasion upon which friendship did in more 
than one instance deem it prudent to desert me. But I had 
read and heard something before about the stability of human 
friendships, and I had never been guilty of supposing that 
human nature would change its character for me. The com 
pliment to the students was justly their due. For they had 
withstood a most ingenious and laborious attempt to ruin 
me in their estimation. 1 

An attempt, the baseness and the cunning of which be 
trayed its origin to me, as plainly as if it had borne its name 
in capitals upon its front. An attempt upon their hearts 
through the medium of their understandings sophistry 
pimping for envy. But the crawling passions of selfish 
subtlety often stumble over the generous feelings of human 
nature, upon which they found no calculation, because they 
cannot comprehend their existence. 

1 "In the mortifications of disappointment, the soothing voice of the love of 
letters shall whisper serenity and peace. In social converse with the mighty dead of 
ancient days, you will never smart under the galling sensation of dependence upon 
the mighty living of the present age; and in your struggles with the world, should a 
crisis ever occur, when even friendship may deem it prudent to desert you; when 
even your country may seem ready to abandon herself and you; when even priest 
and Levite shall come and look on you, and pass by on the other side; seek refuge, 
my unfailing friends, and be assured you will find it, in the friendship of Laelius 
and Scipio; in the patriotism of Cicero, Demosthenes and Burke; as well as in the 
precepts and example of him, whose whole law is love, and who taught us to remem 
ber injuries only to forgive them." Adams, Lectures on Rhetoric and Oratory, II. 396. 



336 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

Youth is generous, and although the majority of the 
students were made to believe that I was a sort of devil 
incarnate in politics, (about which I could not talk to them,) 
yet they never could be persuaded to believe, that I was the 
ignorant impostor in literature, which in so many painful 
pages was undertaken to be proved for their edification. 

The last two years of my life have indeed brought home to 
my bosom the good as well as the bad workings of human 
nature in a multitude of forms, and they have all confirmed 
me in the belief, that the safest guide for human conduct is 
integrity. I have inflexibly followed my own sense of duty, 
relying upon my own understanding. I have lost many 
friends and have made many enemies. Some of the friends 
that I have lost are deeply to be regretted, and most of the 
enemies that I have made are of the most inveterate kind, 
"foes who once were friends." But on the other hand, 
some enemies have been converted into friends, and many 
men, unexpected and active friends, have risen around me, 
while the others were falling off. But the students at col 
lege are not the only steady friends that I have had. There 
are more than one further advanced in life, whose confidence 
in me has remained unshaken through good report and evil 
report. Among the foremost of whom I will mention two, 
Judge Davis 1 and Mr. Emerson, 2 with the hope that you 
and my father will cultivate their friendship in my absence. 
They have been willing still to be considered as my friends, 
at a time when neither my name nor my character was in 
fashionable repute among their associates. I hope I shall not 
forget it.

TO ABIGAIL ADAMS 

At sea, 500 miles from you, 9 August, 1809. 

On Saturday morning, I received by the mail just before 
I came on board, a letter from Mr. Webster, 1 of New Haven, 
requesting me to procure for him, if I can, a Russian dic 
tionary and grammar, with some other books, a commission 
which I shall take pleasure in executing. He is prosecuting 
his plan of a large English dictionary, and although my 
sentiments on such subjects do not agree entirely with him, 
I wish that his industry may meet with its rewards, and his 
ingenuity with encouragement. He published two or three 
years since a letter to Dr. Ramsay, of South Carolina, con 
taining some censures upon Johnson s Dictionary, and some 
criticisms on other writers, which I thought incorrect. 2 In 
one of my lectures I noticed this letter, and contested several 
of its criticisms, but on delivering the lectures to Mr. Hilliard 
for the press I struck out that passage, requesting him not 
to print it. I had not changed my opinion, but I thought 
it might have an appearance of ill-will from me to Mr. 
Webster, which I certainly did not feel, and that it might 
discourage his undertaking more than it ought. I am how 
ever much inclined to have a copy taken of the passage 
which I expunged from the lecture, and sent to Mr. Webster 
himself. For if he should profit by it, as a man of sense al 
ways may profit by friendly censure, it will be more useful to 
him and his work than any Russian dictionary or grammar.

338 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

TO WILLIAM PLUMER 

1 6 August, 1809 (written at sea). 
MY DEAR SIR: 

Among the letters which I received a few days previous 
to my departure from Boston, and which the precipitation 
with which I was obliged to hasten it prevented me from 
answering, I am almost ashamed to acknowledge, was your 
very kind favor of July. I say ashamed to acknowledge it, 
because in examining rigorously the causes which occasioned 
this omission, I cannot but say to myself, and am sensible 
you will have reason to think, that however short my time 
was, I ought to have made an hour at least, for the expres 
sions of grateful sensibility to the obliging attentions of 
friendship. 

To repair as much as remains within my power the fault 
from which I cannot altogether discharge my own mind, I 
take at least the earliest opportunity after my embarkation, 
to do what ought to have preceded it, and to assure you that, 
while absent from our country, I shall feel myself highly in 
debted to you for the benefit of your correspondence, when 
ever your convenience, and the opportunities of a navigation 
so restricted as I am afraid ours will too long continue to be, 
may permit. And in telling you how much I shall prize 
your correspondence, independent of the gratification which 
you will readily conceive an exile from his native land may 
derive from every token of remembrance coming from those 
he most highly values in it, I may add, that the confidence 
with which I shall receive from you either intelligence or 
opinions, will be founded on a sentiment very deeply rooted 
in my experience and observation, that you see more clearly, 
and judge more coolly of men and things relating to our 



1809] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 339 

political world, than almost any other man with whom it has 
been my fortune to act in public life. 

The spirit of party has become so inveterate and so virulent 
in our country, it has so totally absorbed the understanding 
and the heart of almost all the distinguished men among us, 
that I, who cannot cease to consider all the individuals of 
both parties as my countrymen, who can neither approve nor 
disapprove in a lump either of the men or the measures of 
either party, who see both sides claiming an exclusive privi 
lege of patriotism, and using against each other weapons of 
political warfare which I never can handle, cannot but cher 
ish that congenial spirit, which has always preserved itself 
pure from the infectious vapors of faction, which considers 
temperance as one of the first political duties, and which 
can perceive a very distinct shade of difference between 
political candor and political hypocrisy. 

It affords me constant pleasure to recollect that the his 
tory of our country has fallen into the hands of such a man. 1 
For as impartiality lies at the bottom of all historical truth, 
I have often been not without my apprehensions, that no 
true history of our times would appear at least in the course 
of our age; that we should have nothing but federal histories, 
or republican histories, New England histories, or Virginia 
histories. We are indeed not overstocked with men capable 
even of this, who have acted a part in the public affairs of 
our nation. But of men who unite both qualifications, that 
of having had a practical knowledge of our affairs, and that 
of possessing a mind capable of impartiality in summing 
up the merits of our government, administrations, opposi 
tions and people, I know not another man with whom I 
have ever had the opportunity of forming an acquaintance, 

1 The Plumer Papers, in the Library of Congress, contain the manuscript of this 
" History," which was never completed or published. 



340 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

on the correctness of whose narrative I should so implicitly 
rely. 

Such a historian, and I take delight in the belief, will be 
a legislator without reading constituents. You have so long 
meditated on your plan, and so much longer upon the duties 
of man in society, as they apply to the transactions of your 
own life, that I am well assured your work will carry a pro 
found political moral with it. And I hope, though upon this 
subject I have had no hint from you, which can ascertain 
that your view of the subject is the same as mine, but I 
hope, that the moral of your history will be the indissoluble 
union of the North American continent. 1 The plan of a New 
England combination more closely cemented than by the 
general ties of the federal government, a combination first to 
rule the whole, and if that should prove impracticable, to 
separate from the rest, has been so far matured, and has 
engaged the studies, the intrigues and the ambitions of so 
many leading men in our part of the country, that I think 
it will eventually produce mischievous consequences, unless 
seasonably and effectually discountenanced, by men of more 
influence and of more comprehensive views. To rise upon 
a division system is, unfortunately, one of the most obvious 
and apparently easy courses, which plays before the eyes of 
individual ambition in every section of the Union. It is 
the natural resource of all the small statesmen who, feeling 
like Caesar, and finding that Rome is too large an object for 
their grasp, would strike off a village where they might 
aspire to the first station, without exposing themselves to 
derision. This has been the most powerful operative im 
pulse upon all the divisionists, from the first Kentucky con-

plans of certain federalists in 1804 and sympathized with their aims. Adams

spiracy, down to the negotiations between Massachusetts, 
Connecticut, and New Hampshire, of the last winter and 
spring. Considered merely as a purpose of ambition, the 
great objection against this scheme is its littleness. Instead 
of adding all the tribes of Israel to Judah and Benjamin, like 
David, it is walking in the ways of Jeroboam, the son of 
Nabat, who made Israel to sin by breaking off Samaria from 
Jerusalem. Looking at it in reference to moral considera 
tions, it is detestable, as it certainly cannot be accomplished 
by open and honorable means. The abettors are obliged to 
discover their real designs, to affect others, to practice con 
tinual deception, and to work upon the basest materials the 
selfish and dissocial passions of their instruments. Politically 
speaking, it is as injudicious, as it is contracted and dishon 
orable. The American people are not prepared for disunion, 
far less so than these people imagine. They will continue to 
resist and defeat every attempt of that character, as they 
uniformly have done, and such projects will still terminate 
in the ruin of their projectors. But the ill consequences of 
this turbulent spirit will be to keep the country in a state of 
constant agitation, to embitter the local prejudices of fellow- 
citizens against each other, and to diminish the influence 
which we ought to have, and might have, in the general councils 
of the Union. 

To counteract the tendency of these partial and foolish 
combinations, I know nothing so likely to have a decisive 
influence as historical works, honestly and judiciously ex 
ecuted. For if the doctrine of union were a new one, now 
first to be inculcated, our history would furnish the most 
decisive arguments in its favor. It is no longer the great 
lesson to be learnt, but the fundamental maxim to be con 
firmed, and every species of influence should be exerted by 
all genuine American patriots, to make its importance more

highly estimated and more unquestionably established. I 
should have been glad to see a little more of this tendency in 
Marshall s Life of Washington, than I did find. For Washing 
ton was emphatically the man of the whole Union, and I see a 
little too much of the Virginian in Marshall. Perhaps it 
was unavoidable, and perhaps you will find it equally im 
possible to avoid disclosing the New England man. I have 
enough of that feeling myself most ardently to wish, that 
the brightest examples of a truly liberal and comprehensive 
American political system may be exhibited by New England 
men. 

I regret that I could not have the pleasure of a full and con 
fidential personal interview with you before my departure. 
My father, I am sure, will be happy to see you at Quincy, 
and to furnish you any materials in his power. He has been 
for the last three months publishing papers, which I think 
will not be without their use to your undertaking. 

Adieu, my dear sir, I write you this letter on the Grand 
Bank of Newfoundland, after passing the night in catching 
cod, of which in the interval of a six hours calm we have 
caught upwards of sixty. In the association of ideas there 
is no very unnatural transition from cod fishing on the 
Grand Bank to the history of the United States. No man 
will I trust be better able than yourself to supply the inter 
mediate links in this singular concatenation. Let me only 
hope it will appear to you as natural a transition, as that 
from any subject whatsoever, to the assurance of that re 
spect and attachment with which I subscribe myself, etc.

TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 

[ROBERT SMITH] 

CHRISTIANSAND in Norway, 23 September, 1809. 
SIR: 

I have the honor of informing you, that I sailed from Bos 
ton the 5th of August in the ship Horace, Captain Bickford, 
and met with no interruption in the progress of my voyage, 
until we arrived on the coast of Norway. 1 

On the 1 7th, the day before we made the land, the ship 
was brought to by an armed brig from which we were hailed 
in English, and our captain ordered to let down his boat, and 
go on board of her. This after an expostulation on his part, 
objecting to putting out his boat in the heavy sea that ran, 
which was answered only by a repetition of the order and a 
musket ball fired from the cruiser s forecastle as the vessels 
lay along side, as near as they could be worked to each other, 
was attempted, and found impracticable. After reaching 
with great difficulty his own ship again, Captain Bickford 
hoisted in his boat, hailed the cruiser again, and declared the 
impossibility of getting on board of her with his boat, upon 
which she left us, without venturing out her own boat and 
without showing any colors. She must probably have been 
English, as no other armed ships of that force are upon this 
coast. 

The next day, being the i8th, we made the land, and the 
day following were successively boarded by two British 
cruisers, who after examining the papers permitted the ship 
to proceed. 2 As there was an appearance of stormy weather,

and the wind ahead, our captain concluded to make a harbor, 
and we came into that of Flecknoe, about four miles distant 
from this place. After we had a pilot on board, we were 
boarded by a small two mast boat, sent out from the gun 
boats stationed here, the lieutenant 1 of which manifested a 
disposition to take possession of the ship. 2 This however was 
not done, and the commanding officer of all the gun-boats 
and other naval force in Norway, Fischer, who is accidentally 
here at this time, and who has shown me the greatest atten 
tion and civility, apologized to me for the conduct of his 
lieutenant. 

Not having a passport, I was obliged to exhibit my com 
mission itself to the commanding officer of the gun-boats, 
to authenticate my character, to which every respect cus 
tomary among nations has been paid. The weather has de 
tained us here three days, and the equinoctial gale is still 
raging. I found here upwards of thirty masters of American 

1 Kraff. 

2 To his brother he wrote more fully upon this incident: "The harbor of Chris- 
tiansand was in sight, and having a head wind and an approaching gale, Captain 
Bickford concluded to touch there, procure some fresh stores and wait for a more 
favorable wind. After we had a pilot on board, came a two mast boat, with a 
swivel, a Danish lieutenant and about twenty men armed with swords, and boarded 
us. He insisted upon taking us into Christiansand; upon which Captain Bickford 
told him he would not go in at all; wore his ship about and stood to sea. The lieu 
tenant ordered his men in the boat to come on board; the Captain ordered his men 
to keep them off, and pikes and swords and axes were in immediate opposition to 
each other. The lieutenant, finding himself the weakest, made a signal to his men 
to stop, and none of them came on board. The boat was immediately cast off, and 
as we were standing to sea, he and the pilot became excessively alarmed, fearing 
that we were disguised English and would carry them off. The captain thereafter 
consulting me, concluded still to go into harbor, which we did under an island called 
Flecknoe, about four miles from Christiansand. The equinoctial gales came on 
and detained us there until yesterday afternoon, when we again made sail, and 
are now [September 24] within twenty leagues of Elsineur, which place we hope to 
reach tomorrow morning." The next day he had his meeting with Admiral Bertie.

vessels and supercargoes, captured by Danish privateers 
between the months of April and August, and now detained 
for final adjudication in the admiralty court. More than 
half of them have been condemned in the inferior court, 
which sits at this place, and in most of the instances of ac 
quittal the captors have appealed to the superior court at 
Christiania, by which the ships are still detained. All the 
expenses and very heavy costs are decreed against every one 
of the vessels, even when the decision has been against the 
capture. 

A memorial from these unfortunate masters and super 
cargoes to the President of the United States was sent in 
July, which has doubtless before this time reached its destin 
ation. 1 A copy of it, and a letter from them to me, had before 
my arrival here been forwarded by duplicates to me to 
Elsineur 2 and to Petersburg. 

They request my interposition with the Danish govern 
ment in their behalf, and although having no authority from 
my government to speak officially to the Court of Denmark, 
my good offices may probably be of little or no avail to them. 
I propose, however, to attempt a representation in their 
favor at Copenhagen. The grounds upon which most of the 
sentences of condemnation are placed would leave no room 
to doubt the reversal of them at the higher court, should the 
merits of the respective cases operate as the only motives of 
decision. We are ready to proceed upon our voyage, and I 
shall put to sea the first moment that wind and weather will 
permit. 3 I have the honor, etc.

TO HANS RODOLPH SAABYE 

COPENHAGEN, 30 September, 1809. 
SIR: 

Having received a commission as Minister Plenipotentiary 
from the United States of America to his Imperial Majesty 
the Emperor of all the Russias, and being upon my passage 
to St. Petersburg, accidentally driven by stress of weather 
into the harbor of Christiansand in Norway, I had the 
mortification to find there upwards of four hundred of my 
countrymen, the masters, supercargoes and crews of the 
greater part of thirty-six American vessels, belonging with 
their cargoes to citizens of the United States, captured and 

examination, we were informed that all the ports of the island of Zealand being in 
a state of rigorous blockade, we could not be suffered to pass. I then went on board 
the Admiral s ship, exhibited to him my commission, and informed him that the 
ship was fitted out for the purpose of conveying me to the place of my destination. 
I also observed to him, that by the usages of nations I understood it was not cus 
tomary to stop a public minister upon his passage. After some consideration he 
frankly admitted the usage, which he said ought to be respected by every liberal 
nation, and consented to our passage, on my giving him my word of honor that we 
would not commit a breach of blockade, by going voluntarily into any of the ports 
of Zealand. He expressed, however, a strong apprehension that we should be 
stopped and detained by the Danes. 

"We passed accordingly, and as we came within about a mile of Cronborg Castle, 
were again boarded by a Danish gun-boat, the men from which took possession of 
the ship, and brought her to anchor in the roads. On information being sent on 
shore, similar to that I had given to Admiral Bertie, the Danes were all ordered to 
leave the ship, and our captain was informed he might proceed without interrup 
tion. On my going on shore the commandant of the castle sent an officer to ask 
for my passport. I went to him and exhibited again to him my commission, in 
forming him that I had no other passport from the United States. With this he 
was satisfied." To the Secretary of State, October 4, 1809. Ms. 

Being detained by head winds Adams went to Copenhagen, in the hope of being 
able to obtain relief for the American captains and seamen then detained by the 
Danish privateer operations.

detained by privateers under Danish colors, and arrested for 
many months in that port. These vessels and cargoes, con 
stituting a mass of property amounting to several millions 
of dollars, captured in the pursuit of their lawful commerce, 
and many of them belonging to merchants of the fairest 
and most respectable character, have not only been thus de 
tained to the immense and almost irreparable detriment of 
their owners, but in many instances have been condemned in 
the lower prize court of Christiansand upon grounds, which 
I am persuaded can never be sanctioned by the higher court, 
and in many other instances the masters and crews of the 
vessels have been subjected to personal ill treatment. 1 

On my arrival at Elsineur I learnt with great concern that 
this unfortunate situation was not peculiar to my country 
men in Norway, but that sixteen other American vessels had 
been captured under circumstances nearly similar, and de 
tained in this port and in Jutland. And although these have 
been all liberated, excepting two, 2 even by the decision of the 
prize court in the first instance, yet they have all been har 
assed by the obligation imposed upon them to pay costs, 
and in some cases even charges to the captors, and by the 
appeal of the captors from the sentences of the lower court, 
they have been reduced to the alternative either of sacrific 
ing large sums of money to purchase an abandonment of the 
appeal, or of submitting to a detention still more expensive 
and ruinous. 

In no instance whatsoever, either in Norway or here, have 
the captors been sentenced to pay damages, or even sub 
jected to the payment of costs and charges, a circumstance 
the more striking, when connected with the consideration, 
that in some of the Norway cases the captors had not even

a legal commission from his Majesty s government, authoriz 
ing to make the capture. 

Although I have not the honor of being accredited to the 
court of his Danish Majesty, and can therefore not be au 
thorized to make official representations in behalf of these 
my distressed countrymen in the name of my government, 
yet, as there is no other minister of the United States in this 
vicinity, and as I have been an eye witness of the unhappy 
situation in which so many of my fellow-citizens with their 
property is placed, I have felt it to be my indispensable duty 
to make some exertion in their behalf, and reposing the most 
perfect confidence in the justice, benevolence and humanity 
of his Majesty, I have been persuaded that the circumstances 
I have here mentioned, at least in their aggravations, could 
not have been made known to him; that this government 
would on such an occasion admit of representations, an 
ticipating the authority which that of the United States 
alone can give, and would welcome from any quarter a 
statement which would furnish the means of releasing from 
distress and injury so great a number of citizens of a friendly 
nation, whose interests and whose feelings have ever cordially 
sympathized with those of Denmark, and with whom a com 
merce entirely beneficial to both parties had heretofore been 
so happily maintained. 

With this view I have proceeded to this place, in the hope 
of being honored by an interview and conference with his 
Excellency the Minister of State, Count Bernstorff, 1 but 
have had the disappointment to find that he is not in the city, 
and the lateness of the season rendering the remainder of the 
navigation to St. Petersburg daily more impracticable, makes 
it impossible for me to wait the uncertain period of his return. 

I therefore take the liberty of requesting you, sir, as the 

1 Christian Gunther, count von Bernstorff (1769-1835). 



i8o9l JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 349 

officer of the United States especially charged with the com 
mercial interests of their citizens in this kingdom, to lay the 
substance of this representation before his Excellency Count 
Bernstorff upon his return, and to solicit of his Excellency 
such interposition of his Majesty s government for the relief 
of those American sufferers, as he in his wisdom shall think 
just and proper. 

The United States, whose people have so long and so con 
stantly been accustomed to find in the Danish government 
one of the greatest and most ardent defenders of neutral 
rights, and who, in the name of Bernstorff, for more than one 
generation have learnt to revere their firm and able sup 
porter, may still further corroborate their expectation of 
complete and final justice to their citizens, by the reference 
to their own conduct towards the subjects of his Danish 
Majesty s under cases of some resemblance to those which 
occasion this letter. During the period of partial hostility 
between the United States and France, in the years 1798 and 
1799, when certain Danish subjects and property had been 
captured by American armed vessels, though under circum 
stances of more colorable suspicion than many of those al 
leged by the Norway prize court as motives of condemnation, 
yet on final trial before the Supreme Judicial Court of the 
United States, not only complete restitution was awarded to 
those of Danish subjects, but heavy damages imposed upon 
the captors, the payment of which I believe has in more than 
one instance been made by the United States themselves. 

It has given me much satisfaction to be informed that for 
some time past the privateers, whose depredations and out 
rages had occasioned all those grounds of complaint, have 
been by his Majesty s orders suppressed. It might, there 
fore, be less necessary to remark, that their practice was to 
carry in without discrimination every American that they 



350 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

boarded, without any examination of their papers whatso 
ever. But as this suppression must naturally have resulted 
from the demonstration having been made to his Majesty 
of the excesses committed by these privateers, may it not 
be urged, as an additional motive for a special interposition 
of his Majesty s government, at least to accelerate the final 
decisions of the prize courts, which can alone stop the ac 
cumulation of loss and injury to the Americans, who have 
been detained in a manner so little conformable to the most 
unquestioned principles of neutral right. To give additional 
energy to this request as it regards the Norway cases, it 
may not be improper to state, that the Americans thus con 
fined at Christiansand are not only suffering already from a 
scantiness of obtaining the means of subsistence, but that 
by contributing to increase the scarcity of provisions, they 
add inevitably to the wants of the inhabitants of the place, 
inasmuch that the magistrates have already thought it nec 
essary to limit the purchases which the Americans there are 
allowed to make for the supply of their own necessities. 

I forbear, sir, to recount details of complaint important 
to individuals, but which, however they might be regretted 
by his Majesty s government, it would be found difficult to 
redress; the great object for which I would solicit their in 
terposition is, to obtain the liberation as speedily as possible 
of those to whom every day of detention is a heavy charge 
of expense and loss, and who from the condition of their 
captors, have every reason to believe that in the last resort 
their only expectation of indemnity for their losses and in 
juries, will be in the justice of this government itself, to 
assume that burden which the captors have as little the 
ability as the will to discharge. I have the honor, etc. 1

ST. PETERSBURG, 14/26 October, 1809. 
SIR: 

On the 2 1st instant I had the honor of writing you from 
Cronstadt, 1 and the next day came up in a passage boat 
belonging to the government, furnished by order of the 
Admiral at Cronstadt, to this place. Soon after landing I 
called upon the Consul General of the United States, Mr. 
Harris, and through him announced my arrival to his Ex 
cellency Count Romanzoff, 2 High Chancellor of the Empire. 
His Excellency appointed last evening at seven o clock to 
receive my visit, which I accordingly made, and was intro- 

particulars forming some of the principal causes of complaint among the Americans 
detained, which perhaps a native American would remonstrate with more propriety 
and more energy than a Danish subject. Among these are some of the regulations 
prescribed by the Danish law for the regulation of privateers, issued in October, 
1807, and which has laid the foundation for all their subsequent depredations. The 
constitution of the inferior prize court is, also, not only propitious to the interests of 
neutrals, consisting either of two naval officers and a civil judge, or of one naval 
officer and one civil judge, the voice of the former always preponderating in case of 
a difference of opinion. This has been always the composition of the prize court in 
Norway; and the greater part of the American vessels and cargoes condemned 
there, have been sentenced under this casting vote of the naval officer, against the 
opinion of his colleague. The examination of the captain and crew of the -captured 
vessels is also conducted in a manner which occasions much embarrassment, not 
only as being in a language which they do not understand, but as neither they nor 
the owners of the captured party are allowed the benefit of counsel in the lower 
court, the opportunities of tampering with the crews, and even with the captains, 
to betray the interests of their owners, and the truth, have not been neglected, and, 
I am sorry to say, in some cases not unsuccessful." To the Secretary of State, Oc

duced to him by Mr. Harris. My appointment to this mis 
sion was already known here, not only from Mr. Harris, but 
by an official communication from General Armstrong to 
Prince Kurakin, the Russian Ambassador at Paris. 

Having mentioned to the Chancellor my wish to obtain 
an audience of the Emperor, he said that he would take the 
orders of his Imperial Majesty upon my request this morning; 
that his Majesty was at this moment confined to his cham 
ber by indisposition, but he would be out again in the course 
of a few days. In the meantime he assured me, that the in 
formation of this mission from the United States had been 
very agreeable to the Emperor. My conversation with the 
Chancellor on this occasion was, of course, short, and con 
fined much to general and indifferent topics. It was how 
ever sufficiently long for him to manifest the most amicable 
dispositions towards the United States and their govern 
ment. He mentioned that, as a mere matter of form, it 
would be necessary for me to furnish him a copy of my 
credential letter. Presuming that he would make this de 
mand conformably to the usage in most of the European 
governments, I had a copy, together with a French transla 
tion of it, in my pocket and delivered them to him. 

He had been informed of my having passed through Copen 
hagen on my way to this place, and having mentioned it, I 
took the occasion to state to him the motive of my visit to 
that city. He expressed a strong disapprobation of the 
very extraordinary proceedings in Denmark towards the 
commerce of the United States, and said that his govern 
ment had some strong reasons of complaint on the same ac 
count. He observed, that it was to be lamented that a more 
liberal system of conduct towards neutral navigation could 
not be established by the common consent of all nations, 
but this was a dream, "mais c est un reve" and as 



i8o9] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 353 

long as it was not universally recognized, it was not possible 
that it should be invariably observed by any partial com 
bination. That notwithstanding the exemplary wisdom and 
moderation of the American government, they had found 
by the negotiation with England, so often terminated to be 
gin over again, "si souvent conclues, pour recommen- 
cer" how difficult it was to obtain this security for our 
commerce. 

I said that the United States had indeed found that nego 
tiation with England upon the subject of commercial rights 
on the sea was no easy undertaking, but that I did not yet 
despair of seeing the liberal system established by the uni 
versal consent of all nations. That in the progress of human 
society it had not been found impracticable to prevail upon 
mankind by degrees to abandon many barbarous usages in 
war, and that I could not readily renounce the hope of seeing 
all mankind become ashamed of cruel and inhuman customs 
upon the seas, as well as upon the land. He replied that it 
was much to be desired, but he feared the prospect of this 
fortunate state of things was yet distant. There was, how 
ever, he added, this day the promise of an important and 
happy step towards a general pacification. A courier had 
this day arrived with a letter from the Emperor of France 
to the Emperor Alexander informing him, that the terms of 
peace between France and Austria were substantially agreed 
upon, and that in all probability the treaty would be con 
cluded in a few days. 1 

As I was taking my leave the Count apologized for a 
deviation from all formality to an opportunity, to express

himself in terms of the warmest personal regard for Mr. 
Harris. This gentleman appears, indeed, to have conducted 
himself in a manner so highly acceptable to this government, 
as not only to have acquired a personal consideration en 
joyed by few even among the diplomatic characters ac 
credited to the Emperor, but to have contributed much to 
the favorable dispositions towards our country entertained 
by his Imperial Majesty. 

He has already transmitted to you a copy, officially com 
municated to him by the Chancellor, of the treaty of peace 
between Russia and Sweden, a treaty highly advantageous 
to this country, as it annexes to its territories the whole 
important province of Finland, thus uniting both sides of the 
gulf under the Russian dominion, and placing under the said 
subjection one half the gulf of Bothnia, with the island of 
Aland which commands its mouth. 1 

The article which stipulates the total exclusion of British 
vessels, whether of war or commerce, is of vast importance 
to the ultimate success of what is called in the treaty the 
continental system. The free admission to the ports of 
Sweden has substantially given to the British the complete 
command of the Baltic, and a circulation to the commerce 
and productions of Britain throughout the north scarcely 
inferior to that of peaceable times. Excluded from the ports 
of Sweden, as they already were from all others within the 
Baltic, they will find it difficult to maintain a naval force in 
that sea, which more than all others requires for fleets nav 
igating within its compass harbors of refuge from its storms,

ST. PETERSBURG, 16/24 November, 1809. 
My last letter brought our good ship Horace to anchor safe 
in the Road of Elsineur, on the 28th of September. At that 
place we were detained a full week by adverse winds. Hav 
ing been informed upon my landing there, that the King of 
Denmark l and his principal minister, Count BernstorfT, were 
both absent from Copenhagen, I gave up in the first instance 
the intention of going thither. But having received from 
several masters of vessels and supercargoes detained there 
a very urgent letter requesting me to come, I went with Mr. 
Smith and made an attempt to see the Minister, who was 
not at Copenhagen but at his country seat a few miles dis 
tant from the city. He was, however, unfortunately absent 
from home, and I could not wait for his return. I saw how 
ever Mr. Saabye, the American consul at Copenhagen, and 
wrote him a letter containing a representation in behalf of 
the Americans detained, requesting him to lay it before the 
Danish [minister], which he promised he would do. It was 
on the 3Oth of September that I went to Copenhagen. The 
next day I returned to Elsineur, and the morning after em 
barked again on board the ship. We lay wind bound in 
Elsineur Roads until the morning of 5 October, with the 
Danish pilots on board. One to carry us over the grounds, 
and the other to conduct us up the Baltic and the Gulf of 
Finland. From Elsineur to Copenhagen the distance by 
water is about 25 of our miles coastwise, along the shores of 
a beautiful country, interspersed with villages, country seats 
and palaces, on the island of Zealand, and all the way within 
sight of the Swedish coast, which though more remote from

the eye presents a variety of pleasant prospects and one or 
two considerable seaports on the passage. Nearly about mid 
way, lies a small island now belonging to Sweden called 
Hveen, formerly the residence of the celebrated Danish 
astronomer Tycho Brahe, and where his observatory was 
situated. I was told that the ruins of the building were 
still to be seen, but they were not discerned by us. A few 
farm houses and fishing huts, a church and the dwelling 
house of the Swedish nobleman 1 now the proprietor of the 
island, were the substitutes which we could discover, and 
were obliged to content ourselves with instead of the as 
tronomical ruins. One morning while we were yet anchored 
at Elsineur, we saw a British ship of the line lying anchored 
under this island of Hveen. Soon after a ship came down 
from under her guns, and without showing any colors kept 
close upon the Swedish shore, apparently with an intention 
to pass the Castle without stopping. Five or six guns from 
the batteries of Elsineur, which were successively fired at 
her, not having proved sufficient to bring her to, three large 
flat-bottomed gunboats full of men were sent out after her 
from the harbor, and notwithstanding an attempt on her 
part to turn back and get under the guns of the man of war, 
they took and brought her in. The two-decker then came 
down and anchored abreast of us, and within the reach of 
cannon shot but gave us no further trouble. The ship taken 
was the Concordia of New York. 2 For the attempt to pass 
the Castle she was detained and sent to Copenhagen, since 
which I have not heard what has been her fate. 

The passage of the Sound widens very gradually between 
Elsineur and Copenhagen. Abreast of this latter city lies 
a small island called Amager, then north of that an island

called Saltholm, beyond which is the town of Malmo on the 
mainland of Sweden. Between the islands of Amager and 
Saltholm is a very narrow passage, through which ships 
bound up the Baltic are obliged to pass, with shoal water 
on both sides of the passage. This is called going over the 
grounds. At the narrowest part of this passage two guns, 
the second loaded with shot fired from a floating battery of 
three hulks of men of war, compelled us to come to anchor in 
the middle of the channel, until an officer came on board and 
examined the ship s papers. After three other visits of the 
same kind from other gunboats and armed ships, we suc 
ceeded in getting over the grounds and entered the Baltic sea. 
The 6th of October we successively came in sight of the Is 
lands of Moen, Riigen and Bornholm, the last of which be 
came a memorable island to us. For during ten days and 
nights we were beating to and fro in sight of it, without ad 
vancing so much as a league upon our voyage, a great part of 
the time with a constant succession of violent squalls of rain, 
hail and snow, flat calms and strong gales, a torment of a 
sea, and a current as adverse to us as the wind. It now got 
to be the middle of October. The captain, who had been 
eleven voyages to St. Petersburg, who dreaded the Gulf of 
Finland more than the Baltic, and a harbor closed against 
us by the ice at Cronstadt still more than the Gulf of Fin 
land, absolutely despaired of reaching his destined port 
this winter. The Elsineur pilot who had been thirty-six 
voyages to Petersburg was yet more despairing than the 
captain; both were very urgent to give up the attempt of 
reaching St. Petersburg this season, and desirous of putting 
back and going to Kiel in Holstein, from which we should 
have had before us at this season of the year a journey by 
land of 1 500 miles, the best part of which is that which you 
know by experience from Hamburg to Berlin. In the midst 



358 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

of our difficulties the captain fell sick and was confined to 
his bed several days. After resisting, as long as the per 
severance of my spirit would carry me, the propensity of 
both captain and pilot to turn back, I finally gave up the 
contest on condition that, if before we should reach Kiel, a 
favorable change in the wind and weather should occur, we 
should avail ourselves of it and turn again towards our true 
destination. I cannot but reproach myself for this mo 
mentary compliance, as it indicated a flexibility which ought 
not to belong to me. But I had objects on board more 
precious to me than my own life, and there was some reason 
for shrinking from a risk of the ship and cargo, which was 
not mine and which was the special trust of the captain. 
These motives which were my only ones for consenting to 
turn back still appear to me strong, but I ought not to have 
yielded to them. No material evil, however, resulted from 
this fault of mine. The case upon which I had stipulated for 
a resumption of our proper course occurred within forty- 
eight hours after we turned back. The eastern gales sub 
sided into a calm after we had retreated from them about 
thirty leagues. They were soon after succeeded by western 
winds which, though accompanied with gloomy skies and 
foul weather, brought us rapidly towards our port. The 
eleventh day after we had passed the island of Bornholm, 
we came by it the second time on the i6th of October. 

This Bornholm is one of the seven islands which constitute 
the Kingdom of Denmark. The other six are Zealand, 
Fiinen (or rather Fyen), Langeland, Lolland, Falster and 
Moen, a cluster which lie contiguous to each other at the 
entrance of the Baltic. Bornholm is more distant from the 
rest and about twenty leagues up what is called the Baltic 
Sea. Upon our retrograde course we paid a visit to this is 
land, after having been about fifteen miles beyond and in 



JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 359 

constant sight of it for eight days. It has no harbor for 
vessels of the depth of water which we drew, but there are 
in different parts of the coast anchoring grounds which 
afford shelter from particular winds. Near one of its ex 
tremities are two miniature islands called Christianso and 
Friederichsholm, between which is a narrow channel of deep 
water where ships in case of extremity are sometimes admit 
ted and where they lie moored to both the shores. The width 
of the passage between these two islands is less than 200 feet, 
and the islands themselves are not a quarter of a mile in cir 
cumference. We might have gone in there, but the captain 
thought the risk too great. On the 1 3th of October then we 
bore down upon the island of Bornholm, and passing close 
under those of Christianso and Frederichsholm, lay to for 
the night, between a heavy gale and a dead calm under the 
highest land of Bornholm. Saturday morning the I4th we 
hoisted a signal for a boat from the shore, for we were desti 
tute of many articles of provisions, and not overstocked even 
with fresh water. It was some time before a boat came out 
to us, for they took us for a British armed ship showing false 
colors. However one boat ventured out. When they found 
who and what we really were, they reported us to the shore, 
and during the remainder of the day I had a succession of 
messages and officers specially sent from the governor of the 
island offering us every assistance and supply that it ,could 
afford with the most obliging and urgent invitations to come 
on shore; not only to myself but to the ladies whom he par 
ticularly invited to a ball for the evening of the next day.

TO SYLVANUS BOURNE 

ST. PETERSBURG, 28 November, 1809. 
DEAR SIR: 

When we sailed from Boston, which was on the 5th of last 
August, the disavowal of the British government of Mr. 
Erskine s stipulations with ours, was just known in the 
United States, but no measure had yet been taken by the 
President in consequence of it. The proclamation renewing 
the non-intercourse with the British dominions issued a few 
days after. 1 The great change produced in all the external 
commercial relations of the United States by this act will 
be too obvious to your understanding to require any elucida 
tion from me. Nor will it escape your observation, how much 
the affairs of our country may probably be affected by two 
events, which have already occurred in this hemisphere, 
since I landed upon it, the peace between Russia and Sweden, 
and that between France and Austria. What immediate 
effect either or both of these important occurrences will have 
upon the policy of Great Britain or of France, in relation to 
commerce, your situation enables you to ascertain sooner 
and more accurately than I can here. The result of Mr. 
Jackson s 2 intended negotiation in America is, perhaps, al 
ready known to you, while we here have but within these two 
days learnt the certainty of his arrival at Baltimore. The 
change in the British Ministry, too, though a circumstance 
of less magnitude in itself than the others just noticed, may be 
attended with consequences not less important and extensive. 3

1809] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 361 

If your information and conjectures are well founded, that 
the persons of principal influence in the councils of princes 
have a direct interest in maintaining the systems of restric 
tion and depredations upon American commerce, which 
have characterized for the last two or three years the meas 
ures of both the great belligerent powers, it is much to be 
apprehended that this unjust and impolitic course may still 
be persevered in, until the public interest shall regain its 
natural and proper ascendancy. By the letter of Monsieur 
de Champagny to General Armstrong, dated in August 
last, 1 France has very precisely and positively promised to 
set aside those of her decrees which have given us just cause 
of complaint, if Great Britain will set aside those no less 
outrageous, upon which the French decrees are alleged to 
have been founded. But while Great Britain negotiates, and 
disavows, and negotiates again, upon points concerning which 
neither the honor nor interest of the United States will ad 
mit of any compromise, if we are to wait for the repeal of 
the French decrees until a sound head shall guide the councils 
of the British Cabinet, our prospects of redress, and even of 
the practicable exercise of our just rights upon the ocean, 
are remote and precarious indeed. . . . 



TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
No. 7. [ROBERT SMITH] 

ST. PETERSBURG, 4 December, 1809. 
SIR: 

I have the honor to inclose a copy of a note which I 
have sent to Count Romanzoff, the Chancellor of the Empire 

1 August 22, 1809. American State Papers, Foreign Relations, III. 325. 



362 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

relating to two American vessels 1 captured, one, by a Rus 
sian frigate, and the other by a privateer under Russian 
colors, and condemned by certain committees of prizes for 
breaches of blockades, which the American proprietors 
allege did not exist, or were at least unknown to the masters 
of their vessels when taken. Finding upon my arrival here 
that Mr. Harris had already made to this government such 
representations in behalf of those proprietors as their re 
spective cases admitted, I have thought it advisable only by 
a note in general terms to inform the Chancellor that I had 
been instructed upon the subject, and to intimate the hope 
and expectation that justice might be done to these claims 
speedily. With regard to the brig Hector, belonging to Mr. 
Thorndike, there seems to be no doubt but that the capture 
was illegal. The case of the vessel belonging to the Way- 
mouth Commercial Company is not quite so clear, as it is 
certain that a blockade of the port did exist. 

The indulgences which on the continent of Europe have 
been allowed to Americans by way of exception to the gen 
eral system of commercial restriction have been so consid 
erable, that British commercial speculators have resorted to 
the art of personating Americans and of using forged papers 
to obtain the participation of these privileges. A very few 
days after my arrival here Mr. Harris presented me a pass 
port, purporting to bear the signature of the present mayor 
of New York, in favor of one Archibald John Graham, 
whom it styled a native citizen of the United States. It was 
dated the 3rd of January of the present year, and had been 
endorsed at the mayoralty of the city of Narennes, the 2nd 
of March. With this paper, Mr. Harris presented me a 
letter from a merchant 2 who he assured me bore a very 

1 The Commerce, commanded by Joseph Tirrell, and the Hector, Luke Thorndike. 

2 Plessig, by name. 



i8o9] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 363 

respectable reputation in this city, in which this gentleman 
gave me in the most explicit terms his guaranty that Graham 
was a native citizen of the United States, and requested me 
to authenticate the passport by my signature. At the same 
time, Mr. Harris gave me notice that he suspected the 
paper to be forged, as he had already detected one or two 
others of the same form and appearance. I therefore delayed 
my answer to the respectable merchant of St. Petersburg two 
or three days, in the interval of which came from Lisbon, the 
port where Graham was waiting for my authentication of his 
passport, a real American citizen, who assured Mr. Harris, 
that this Graham, far from being a native citizen of the 
United States, had probably never set his foot in America, 
that he was a Scotchman by birth, and had come to Lisbon 
with a vessel under Pappenburg colors; but which had been 
an American vessel, which had come from the United States 
by violating the embargo. I afterwards saw the same real 
American citizen, myself; who told me that this Graham 
belonged to a commercial house in Liverpool where he had 
a brother, and from which he was accustomed to sail as a 
British master of a vessel; that in all probability the passport 
was a sheer forgery; and that not only such passports, but 
all the ships papers required for a vessel of the United States 
were made in London by a man of the name of Van Sander, 
who kept a shop of public notoriety for the sale of such 
documents to any person who chose to pay for them. 

I answered the respectable merchant of St. Petersburg, and 
now enclose translation of his letter and of my answer. A 
day or two afterwards the same gentleman wrote to Mr. 
Harris expressing his great mortification at the issue of his 
application, his strong apprehension that the passport would 
again be sent for my authentication by the maritime com 
mission, and that by my refusal Graham s vessel and cargo 



364 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

would be condemned. He also requested Mr. Harris to pro 
cure from me my consent to return him his letter of guaranty. 
This I declined, assuring him, however, that I should make 
no unnecessary use of his name, which might expose him to 
inconvenience. 

A few days after, I received from Count Romanzoff a note, 
enclosing the same passport, mentioning that it had incurred 
the suspicions of the maritime commission, and enquiring 
whether I could certify the authenticity of the signature. 
Translations of this note, and of my answer, are also enclosed. 
I had also a personal interview with the Chancellor, 1 in 
which I stated to him the substance of the information I 
had obtained, but in which I was still restricted in the use 
of names, the American citizen from whom I had received my 
information having been altogether unwilling that his name 
should be given. 

It was still barely possible that Graham might be a native 
citizen of the United States, and the passport a genuine 
paper. I did not possess the means of giving judicial solem 
nity to the declarations of the American citizen from whom 
I derived my information; neither was his knowledge itself 
of a character to which he could make oath in judicial form. 
As the man s person was in danger at least of imprisonment 
and his property at stake, I thought it necessary to com 
municate with all proper caution to Count Romanzoff the 
circumstances which had come to my knowledge, to give 
them barely as suspicions concerning which the means of 
ascertaining the truth was in the tribunals of the country; 
and to guard against any precipitancy of decision, which 
might affect injuriously any unsimulated American citizen. 
The Count assured me that every just precaution should be 
used to answer the ends of substantial justice, and all due

discretion in securing it. He animadverted with some 
severity on the British government for its countenance of 
such a practice as forgery by suffering such a public traffic 
of false papers, in the very capital of the kingdom. 

With this letter I shall send you the first number of a col 
lection of paragraphs and notices from the newspapers of 
this continent, which I propose to continue and to forward 
from time to time, by every opportunity which may occur, 
direct or indirect. Their object is to contribute to the mass 
of your information from Europe. As taken from news 
papers, they may be committed to any kind of conveyance 
as relating to public affairs in general, and not within my 
particular charge, they will not need a signature, and you 
will probably sometimes receive a number without any other 
indication of the source from which it comes than the hand 
writing or this notice. The subjects upon which I shall make 
extracts will be very various and perhaps often carry with 
them hardly enough of interest to deserve the President s 
or your perusal. The purpose however will be to concen 
trate information, which it may be useful for you to possess, 
and though situated at the extremity of Europe, requiring 
nearly as much time for intelligence from the principal seats 
of action to reach us, as from them to the United States, 
it is possible that you may thus receive even from hence in 
formation which will not previously have reached you from 
elsewhere. 1

366 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

TO THOMAS BOYLSTON ADAMS 

December 14, 1809. 

The messages from the governor of the island of Bornholm, 
which I mentioned in my last, were sent and received in the 
midst of an Irish gale of wind while we were stretching to 
and from the shore of the island, under close reefed top-sails. 
Close under the high lands of the coast, boats were able to 
come out to the ship, but she could not lay to these without 
drifting beyond the length of the whole island, and whenever 
we got without shelter of the hills, we found a sea and a 
storm which the ship had as much as she could do to live and 
be wholesome. As night came on we could no longer stretch 
in under the shore. I had sent a promise to the governor 
that if we should remain wind bound the next day, I would 
go on shore to pay my respects to him, and return in person 
my thanks for his civilities. I saw that if I should go on 
shore, the ball would be unavoidable, and that would oc 
casion our detention not only for that day, but probably for 
a great part of the next. I therefore now consented to the 
captain and pilot s earnest entreaties to stand off before the 
wind, and go to Kiel, unless a favorable change of the wind 
before our arrival there should enable us again to face our 
true destination. We had about two days sail to Kiel. But 
we pursued our retrograde course only about sixty miles; for 
in the course of the same night (Saturday, 14 October) the 
storm died away. The next day we had a calm, and the day 
following a favorable wind for proceeding up the Baltic. On 
the first appearance of the change I summoned the captain to 
his promise, with which he immediately though reluctantly 
complied. On Monday, the i6th of October, we finally 
passed the islands of Bornholm and Christianso. About 
twenty-five leagues northeast of these on the passage up the 



i8o9l JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 367 

Baltic lies the island of Oland, next to which about as much 
farther is that of Gothland, celebrated in the middle ages for 
its commerce and the capital of which, Wisby, is yet well 
known to all our lawyers by its code of maritime laws. Our 
pilot and captain were anxious to get a sight of these islands, 
especially the last, in order to get what they call a fresh de 
parture. For in navigating the Baltic the currents are so 
variable both in their force and direction, that a continual 
recurrence to landmarks is necessary to ascertain where you 
are. The iyth of October we had again a head wind, and 
the captain s inclination to go to Kiel returned. To this 
however I did not consent, though he put upon me the re 
sponsibility for the ship and cargo by the consequences of 
persisting in the voyage. Still, more fortunately for the 
ship and cargo than for ourselves, I did persist, and after 
about thirty-six hours we had a return of fair wind again. 
But the weather was thick and gloomy. Four days in suc 
cession, no observation of the sun could be obtained, and 
no sight not only of Oland or Gothland, but even of Osel or of 
Dago, which last is the island at the entrance of the Gulf of 
Finland. An inspection of any map of the Baltic will show 
you this gauntlet of islands, between which a vessel must 
wind before reaching this terrible Gulf. In the long days and 
mild weather of summer it is not more dangerous than other 
seas; but in the night almost total which reigns after the 
autumnal equinox and the tempestuous weather of approach 
ing winter, it is formidable indeed. Our anxieties were the 
greater from an uncertainty, whether any of the usual lights 
were kept at the most difficult and dangerous passes. For a 
British fleet had been stationed at the mouth of the Gulf 
during the whole season of navigation, and we knew that 
the Russian lights had in that interval been extinguished. 
About midnight of the I9th of October we were overtaken 



3 68 THE WRITINGS OF [1809 

by an American ship, the Ocean of New York, 1 bound like 
ourselves to Cronstadt, and with whom from that time we 
sailed in company. The 2Oth, after having been all day 
straining every eye on board ship for sight of Dago, we spoke 
at the dusk of evening with a small Mecklenburg vessel 
which was standing out, and from which we obtained infor 
mation that we had passed all the islands, which had so ob 
stinately eluded our sight, and were advanced about fifteen 
leagues up the Gulf. That the lights on the Russian coast 
were all again lighted, and that in the course of two hours we 
should make that of Odensholm, which she had seen since 
noon of the same day. At this intelligence (magna componere 
parvis), we felt as Columbus did at the sight of the light 
ashore on his first voyage. We found the information exact, 
and made the light just as it had been told us we should 
make it. With a fine fresh breeze and a moonlight night we 
ascended the Gulf, and passed five or six different lighthouses 
before morning. Then came a sweeping gale at northeast, 
which cleared the skies of every cloud and vapor, but kept 
us the whole day as near the wind as possible, and most of 
it under short sail. About eight that evening we passed the 
island of Hogland lighted by two fires,, which are kept instead 
of lighthouses. This is perhaps the most dangerous spot in 
the Gulf. Hogland is a rock rather than an island, situated 
in the middle of the Gulf, with shallows on both sides, and 
the passage between it and a shoal on its north side is not 
two miles wide. We passed it in a mild beautiful moonlight 
evening with just breeze enough to carry us slowly through, 
and to give us a distinct idea of what it is. The next day, 
Sunday, 22 October, at noon we anchored in Cronstadt 
roads, but could not procure a pilot to carry the ship that 
night into the mole. I landed however that evening with 

1 Captain Benjamin Richards. 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 369 

all the family excepting Mr. Smith, who remained on board 
expecting to go in with the ship the next morning. At 
Cronstadt we presented ourselves to the Admiral l of the 
port, who received and treated us with great civility; but 
it was with the utmost difficulty that we got a lodging for 
the night, which we were ultimately obliged to take at the 
house of Mr. Sparrow, who is the agent for American vessels 
at Cronstadt. The same night a violent gale of wind came 
on, which continued the whole of the next day, and which 
made it impossible either for the ship to get into the mole, or 
to send a boat on board for Mr. Smith. But as the wind was 
fair for coming to St. Petersburg, and as the Admiral oblig 
ingly offered us a government cutter to bring us up, we ac 
cepted of the opportunity, and in about three hours of time 
accomplished the passage. We landed on the quay of the 
river Neva, just opposite the magnificent equestrian statue 
of Peter the Great, at three in the afternoon, of the 23rd of 
October, the eightieth day from that of our embarkation at 
the wharf in Charlestown. 



TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 

No. 8. [ROBERT SMITH] 

ST. PETERSBURG, 3 January, 1810. 

With his letter from Stockholm, Mr. [J. S.] Smith trans 
mitted to me that which you did me the honor to write me 
on the 3 ist of July last; together with one of the same date 
from Mr. Graham, and a special passport for myself and 
family. These dispatches it appears arrived at Boston the 
day after we had sailed. Had they reached Boston the day

370 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

before, I should have availed myself of the permission to 
take passage in the Essex; and although it must have delayed 
my departure for several days, probably we should have 
accomplished the voyage in less time than we did on board 
the Horace. The appearance of an American frigate upon 
this occasion in the Baltic and Gulf of Finland, would have 
produced an impression more congenial to the military senti 
ments of European nations, and might perhaps have con 
tributed to increase the consideration which the character 
of our country is acquiring. It would undoubtedly have had 
a more favorable effect, than the arrival of a public minister 
in a merchant vessel, upon the opinions of a court addicted 
to^official parade beyond any other in Europe. 

You will have seen in my former letters, how often upon 
the voyage I experienced the want of the special passport, 
and the occasions upon which I was obliged to exhibit my 
commission, as a substitute for it. My right of free passage, 
and the privileges of the character with which I was invested 
were universally respected as soon as they were authentically 
made known, but the evidence was in more than one in 
stance required. While any thing like the present condition 
of the European world shall continue, I should recommend 
that any future public minister, coming from the United 
States, should be conveyed under the protection of the gov 
ernment flag, and at the same time be provided with a special 
passport like that which you had the goodness to have made 
out for me. 

With these papers, I received also the copy of General 
Armstrong s cypher, of which I shall have immediate occa 
sion to make use. 

Since I had the honor of writing you last, I have received 
a note from the Chancellor of the Empire, Count RomanzofT, 
containing two questions, relating to the navigation of vessels 



isio] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 371 

under our flag. Translations of this letter, and of my answer 
are enclosed. 

Among the vessels, under the flag of the United States, 
which arrived at Cronstadt just before the closure of that 
port by the ice, were two with registers of the London manu 
facture. They have all the other papers with which Amer 
ican vessels navigating the European seas are usually pro 
vided, but whether these also are forgeries, or purchases, 
Mr. Harris has not the means of detecting as he could the 
register. As a forgery, this paper is clumsily executed, al 
though the signatures, the seals, and the private marks, are 
imitated with all the care and assiduity that English artists 
could bring to their task. Some of the private marks how 
ever have escaped their vigilance. The seals betray the 
stamp of a die too recently engraved and the printed parts 
of the plate vary materially from those of the genuine regis 
ter. Mr. Harris has given notice to the Chancellor of this 
new imposture, and the vessels with their cargoes will prob 
ably be condemned. 

In the extracts from the Gazettes, No. 2, which you will 
find enclosed, are contained the order of the French Em 
peror, prohibiting the introduction of colonial merchandize 
into Hamburg, by land or by water; the advertisment of the 
French consul at Copenhagen that he will deliver no more 
certificates of origin for the same species of goods; and the 
order of the king of Denmark, establishing a commission 
in the principal ports of Holstein for the examination of all 
goods imported there suspected to be English. Together 
w r ith this last order was issued one which has not been pub 
lished, but under which property of American citizens to a 
very large amount has been sequestered, with circumstances 
of peculiar hardship. A number of Americans at Hamburg, 
masters, supercargoes and owners of these goods, forwarded 



372 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

an application to me for my interference to obtain the re 
lease and restitution of their property. I accordingly had a 
conference with the Chancellor, Count Romanzoff, in conse 
quence of which, by the express orders of his Imperial 
Majesty, the Danish minister at this Court has been re 
quested to urge upon his government the immediate release 
and restitution of the property of American citizens, se 
questered by the recent order of the King of Denmark, as 
a measure in which the Emperor of Russia takes a particular 
interest, and in which a compliance with his desire will give 
him peculiar satisfaction. I have also in a personal inter 
view with the Baron de Blome, the Danish minister here, 
pressed the same object upon him with all the earnestness, 
which the importance of the interest, and the justice of the 
demand would warrant. The dispositions of the Danish 
government I am persuaded are good, and if left to act as 
their own inclinations and convictions would dictate, they 
will immediately remove the sequester upon the property of 
Americans. But Denmark, as well as her neighbors, ex 
periences the miseries of weakness doing or suffering. 
I am, etc. 



TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 

No. 9. [ROBERT SMITH] 

ST. PETERSBURG, 7 January, 1810. 
SIR: 

In my public Letter No. 8 I have mentioned to you in 
general terms, the result of an application which I made to 
Count Romanzoff, requesting the interposition of the good 
offices of this government with that of Denmark, for the 
speedy restoration of the property of Americans, sequestered 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 373 

by a recent order of his Danish Majesty in the ports of Hoi- 
stein. It may be proper to give you a more particular ac 
count of my conferences with Count Romanzoff upon the 
subject, as they furnished indications not only of the Em 
peror s dispositions with regard to the United States, but 
in relation to the general affairs in Europe, and to the future 
prospects of a general peace. 

I received the letter from the American masters of vessels, 
supercargoes, and owners, of the sequestered property on 
the 24th of December the Emperor s birthday; which 
according to the usage of the country, was engrossed entirely 
by attendance at court, morning and evening, and each time 
for several hours, although the Emperor himself was then at 
Moscow. On the 25th I wrote a note to Count Romanzoff, 
requesting a personal interview with him, which he appointed 
at 7 o clock in the evening of the 26th. At that time I ac 
cordingly attended at the Count s house, and on being in 
troduced to his cabinet, found Baron Blome, the Danish 
minister, with him. He immediately retired, and I informed 
the Count that I came at the request of a number of my 
countrymen, whose property had been arrested in a very 
extraordinary manner, by an order of the Danish govern 
ment in the ports of Holstein. That as to the dispositions of 
the king of Denmark, with regard to English merchandize 
or property, that was no concern of mine; but that a, great 
amount of property, unquestionably neutral, direct from 
America, and after having passed through the examination, 
and paid the duties required by the laws of Denmark, had 
now been arrested by this order, taken entirely from the 
hands and management of its proprietors, and without in 
timation to them of the cause of such a violent measure, or 
in what it was to issue. Purchases to a large amount of the 
productions of this country, had been made here and at 



374 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

Riga on the credit of this property, and the regular payment 
of which depended upon its speedy liberation. As the sub 
ject therefore in some sort became interesting to the govern 
ment of this Empire, I had requested this conference with 
him, to state the circumstances to him and to ask, whether 
the interposition of the Emperor s good offices with the 
Danish government might not be used, in any manner, 
whether officially or otherwise, so that the effect might be 
to levy this sequester upon American property as speedily 
as possible. That being aware it was a subject upon which 
in my character as accredited to this Court I could make no 
formal application, I had not thought proper to address him 
an official note concerning it; but relying upon the good will 
which the Emperor had so often manifested towards my 
country, and on the dispositions equally friendly of the Count 
himself, I had flattered myself that by the exertion of his 
Imperial Majesty s influence with the Danish government, 
the release of this property might be immediately obtained, 
and my countrymen, the owners of it, relieved from the em 
barrassment and alarm occasioned by its detention. 

He said that in regard to the Emperor s dispositions to 
wards the United States, and though by his rank, infinitely 
distant from his Imperial Majesty, as far as he could speak 
of his own, they were as friendly as I could possibly believe 
them. He personally lamented greatly the distress under 
which commerce in general, and with it that of the United 
States, was laboring. That nothing short of a general 
peace could probably put an end to these embarrassments, 
and that this general peace depended upon England alone. 
He knezv not why this general peace should be made, that nothing 
would be asked of England; but on the contrary she would be 
left in possession of what she had acquired. 1 Until she could 

1 Italics represent cypher. 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 375 

be reduced to reasonable terms of peace, it was impossible 
that commerce should be free from rigorous restrictions, 
because it was by operating upon her commerce, that she 
must be made to feel her interest in making peace. As to 
this particular measure of Denmark, it was far from being 
agreeable to him, and he intimated that it was the subject 
upon which he had just been conversing with the Baron de 
Blome. He knew by despatches from the Russian minister l 
the measure had given great dissatisfaction to the Danes them 
selves. There was no occasion to disguise the fact it was not a 
voluntary act on the part of the Danish government. It had been 
exacted by France, whose force at their gates was such as Den 
mark had no means of resisting, and who considered it as a 
measure merely of severity against English commerce; that 
France had suspected Denmark at conniving at the commerce 
with England; at least he knew that M. Champagny had re 
proached them with it in very severe terms and, in fact, the 
whole, or nearly the whole, of that trade must substantially 
be viewed as English commerce, since there were now none 
but English colonies which produced the articles known by 
the denomination of colonial merchandize. 

I assured him that with the exception perhaps of coffee, all 
the articles of colonial trade were produced within the 
United States; and with respect to coffee, as well as the rest, 
there were all the Spanish islands which produced them in 
great quantities. But, said he, is not the produce of the 
United States in these articles, of inferior quality? Cotton 
for instance? I told him the United States produced the 
best of cotton, and in immense quantities; that in all the 
southern States, as well as in Louisiana, the cultivation of 
this article within the last twenty years had flourished beyond 
imagination, and that of all the cotton brought by the Amer- 

1 M. Lizakewitz [or Dizkewitz.] 



376 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

lean vessels whose cargoes were thus sequestered in Holstein, 
I was persuaded that the nine-tenths at least were the gen 
uine produce of the United States; that considerable quan 
tities of sugar were also produced in Louisiana, and in 
Georgia, which doubtless constituted a great proportion of 
those cargoes; and the rest was probably the produce of the 
Spanish islands. Certainly very little, if any, came from the 
British colonies. As to the Spanish islands, he said, they 
could now not easily be distinguished from the British, as 
they had declared themselves for the party of the Junta, 
which in a very extraordinary manner had formally declared 
war against Denmark. 

I remarked that if, in consequence of this declaration of 
war, the Danish government thought proper to prohibit the 
importation for the future of articles the produce of the 
Spanish colonies, it was a measure of expediency which they 
were free to take; but that it could never warrant the seizure 
of goods already imported under the sanction of the Danish 
laws, which, after passing through every examination re 
quired by them, had received the pledge of protection due 
from every civilized government to private property; that 
if this was a French measure, of which the government of 
Denmark was only the passive instrument, I trusted that the 
influence of a sovereign so powerful as the Emperor of Russia, 
and in relations of friendship so close with France, would not 
be exerted without effect at Paris, and it would be immaterial 
to us where the means should be used, if they produced the 
result of doing justice to us and restoring to my countrymen 
their property. The conduct of England towards my coun 
try had been such as certainly not to inspire me with any 
partiality in her favor; and I believed the principle of what 
was called the continental system, that of bringing England 
to dispositions for peace by pressure upon her commerce, a 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 377 

good one, if properly applied; but I was surprised that there 
could at this day exist any person who did not perceive that 
measures which destroyed the active commerce of all other 
nations, instead of reducing turned altogether to the profit 
of that of England; that the Emperor Napoleon s experiment 
had now been three years in operation, and that in the midst 
of the most wasteful expenses, of the grossest internal mis 
management, of the most unfortunate expeditions, in short of 
every thing that could baffle the hopes of the people of Eng 
land, and exasperate them against their own government, no 
petitions, no clamors for peace were heard; and the com 
merce of the country, far from being diminished, was flour 
ishing beyond all former example. As a proof of which I 
referred him to the address from the corporation of London 
to the king on the late jubilee, and to the king s answer. 

The Count smiled, and said that as to addresses to kings and 
their answers, he believed the best rule was to take all such boast 
ing in an inverted sense; for when a father of a family and his 
family are talking together about their affairs before the 
world, they naturally will not speak of their distresses. 

I replied that in such a case as this I believed the conclusion 
would be more consistent with the fact by taking the words in 
their plain and direct sense; the flourishing or distressed state 
of commerce was a state of things too notorious by its sim 
plicity, too certain by the practice of reducing it all to precise 
figures in official returns, to admit of direct falsehoods thus 
asserted in the face of the world. That London was a city 
almost entirely commercial; and the numerous classes of 
people subsisting upon commerce were not accustomed to 
boast of profit while they were actually suffering distress, 
or even to suffer without loud complaint. If, at this time, 
any other king in Europe were to receive an address from the 
principal traders of his kingdom, they would not boast of 



3/8 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

the flourishing state of their commerce; nor would the cor 
poration of London have dared to do so, if the fact had been 
strikingly the reverse. It was not, however, upon this ad 
dress alone that I relied as evidence of the fact. Other in 
dications of the same kind were numerous and decisive. 
How indeed could it be otherwise? The active commerce 
of all other nations, thanks to France, and to France alone, 
was annihilated. France herself, Holland, Sweden, Den 
mark, had nothing that could bear the name of commerce 
left in their own ships. The United States had scarcely any. 
Their intercourse with almost all Europe was suspended. 
Here alone they were still freely admitted, and into those 
ports of Denmark, where this violent measure must break 
it up again to the foundation. The portion of commerce 
carried on by American vessels in the Russian ports was 
small. The number of vessels was ascertained; and his Ex 
cellency as Minister of Commerce knew to what it could 
amount. He also knew how much of the trade was trans 
acted in Russian vessels; and yet it was not for me to tell 
him that between England and this country the commerce ac 
tually carried on was little less than in time of peace. That all 
articles of English growth and manufacture were to be had 
here as if the intercourse was unobstructed, only at heavier 
prices; and that every article of Russian produce for which 
England has occasion goes as plentifully to England as ever. 
He said the prices of Russian articles in England had recently 
risen from which I observed a further proof of my position 
might be derived; for that the rise of prices in England had 
followed as a consequence upon the rise of prices here, which 
had been very considerable. The inference from this last 
fact was irresistible. For if the trade with England had 
actually been suppressed, the prices of the Russian produce 
at home must have fallen in proportion to the unavoidable 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 379 

accumulation of them which would have ensued. The com 
merce, therefore, was still carried on and by whom? it 
was not to be disguised; principally by the English, who, by 
means which I should not undertake to account for, did con 
trive to evade every ordinance and regulation, which were so 
efficacious against all their rivals in trade; and the more 
surely evaded them in proportion as they were more severe. 
I had personally had an opportunity of observing this on 
my voyage hither. For in the Danish dominions the trade 
with England was forbidden upon pain of death; and yet on 
going into a port of Norway, I had seen vessels of that coun 
try, which had passed through the British squadrons as in 
time of profound peace; and I was informed from good au 
thority that there were then seven ships, notoriously English, 
in the port of Bergen loading with timber for England upon 
English account. 

He said that he agreed with me generally in the reasoning, 
but not altogether in the conclusion. That all commerce 
was to be considered as a benefit to both parties. That he 
had no faith in the ordinary doctrines about the balances of 
trade, or that any commerce could long exist unless it was 
profitable on both sides. If commerce therefore suffered, as 
in the present condition of Europe there could be no doubt 
it did, the greatest commercial nation in the end must suffer 
the most. That although this crisis had already continued 
longer than was to be wished, yet it would not be considered 
as a time sufficient for effecting the intended result. It would 
be better that the whole commerce of the world should cease to 
exist for ten years than to abandon it forever to the control 
of England. That the effect of the restrictive system must 
in the long run press hardest upon England; and Mr. Pitt, 
whose talents as a minister must be acknowledged to have 
been great, was compelled by the clamors of the English 



380 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

nation arising from the distress upon their commerce, to 
make way for an administration which made peace. I ac 
knowledged this was true; but observed that it was imput- 
able to a system of measures in relation to commerce directly 
opposite to the present a system which encouraged and 
favored the trade of the nations which were the rivals of 
England, so that the English could not support a competi 
tion with them. And although the English commerce might 
partially suffer in the general mass with the rest, it was much 
more than indemnified by the part which it had acquired 
from the ruins of all the other commercial nations. 

The Count asked me, if I had read a late publication of 
Mr. d lvernois upon this subject. 1 I had heard of the book, 
but not seen it. He said its representations corresponded 
much with the ideas I had been expressing; but in proof of 
his general position of the flourishing state of British com 
merce, he had specified only the condition of Ireland. This 
was not very conclusive. For the commerce of Ireland 
formed a very small part of that of the United Kingdom, and 
when so great stress was laid upon the alleged prosperity of 
one particular branch of trade, it raised a strong presumption 
that the actual state of the whole afforded no subject for 
exultation. 

He concluded by saying that on the subject of my request, 
he would take the orders of the Emperor, and inform me of 
the result; but as this was a measure emanating from the per 
sonal disposition of the Emperor of France, he was apprehensive 
there existed no influence in the world of sufficient efficacy to 
shake his determination; that the United States might always 
rely upon the inclination of the Emperor of Russia to use 

1 Francois d lvernois (1757-1842). The reference is probably to his Effets du 
Hocus continental sur le commerce, etc., des Isles Britanniques, published in London, 
1 8 10. 



isio] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 381 

his good offices in their favor, and most especially in cases 
where they might be applied with any prospect of success. 

I left the Count, with the impression that however he 
might personally disapprove, or the government of the Em 
peror might dislike the step which had thus been imposed 
upon the king of Denmark, no interference of Russia was to 
be expected. 

On the same evening, the Emperor returned from Moscow, 
and on the 2Qth I received a note from the Chancellor, re 
questing me to call upon him at two o clock of that day, 
which I accordingly did. He told me, that on the preceding 
day, being the first since the Emperor s return upon which 
he had transacted business with him, he had reported to his 
Majesty, my application to him, requesting the interposition 
of his good offices with the Danish government for the 
restoration as speedily as possible of the property of Amer 
icans sequestered in the ports of Holstein; that he had in 
formed his Majesty of the answer which in his official char 
acter he had thought it his duty to give me, and to lead me 
to expect, leaving the Emperor s decision entirely free ac 
cording to his own inclinations; that the Emperor had judged 
differently upon the subject from him. He had ordered him 
immediately to represent to the Danish government his wish 
that the examination might be expedited, and the American 
property restored as soon as possible; which order he had 
already executed. He had sent that same morning for the 
Baron de Blome, and had requested him to transmit to his 
court these sentiments of the Emperor, with the assurance 
that his Majesty took great interest in obtaining a com 
pliance with them; that the Emperor not only took this 
determination without hesitating, but was gratified in avail 
ing himself of the opportunity to manifest his friendship for 
the United States. Perhaps the interest of his own subjects 



3 82 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

might justify his interference on this occasion: this was what 
he had not thought it necessary to examine. It was sufficient 
for him that it would show the regard which he felt for the 
interests of the United States, and his wish to inspire their 
confidence in these sentiments on his part. He desired me 
to mention to Baron de Blome, when I should have an op 
portunity to see him, that he had told me of the Em 
peror s determination, and of the Count s interview with 
him respecting it. And he further observed that the Baron 
had told him, what he had said to me before, that it was a 
measure into which Denmark had been impelled by France, and 
which she had taken with reluctance. 

I assured the Count, that I should inform my government 
of this fresh instance of the Emperor s friendship, and that 
I could answer by anticipation for the grateful acknowledg 
ment with which it would be received. That on leaving him 
before, I had felt obliged to him for the frank and candid 
manner in which he had spoken with regard to the object of 
my application; it was in my mind far preferable to a more 
flattering manner, which might have led to hopes, afterwards 
disappointed. But from his manner of considering the sub 
ject at that time having entertained little or no hopes of 
success, I was now the more gratified at finding that my 
countrymen would have the benefit of his Majesty s power 
ful intercession. 

Having on the same day an opportunity of conversing 
with the Baron de Blome, I told him, according to Count 
Romanzoff s desire, that I had been informed of the commu 
nication to him, of the Emperor s wish for the restoration of 
the sequestered American property, in the ports of Holstein. 
The Baron then repeated that it was a measure to which they 
had been goaded by France; that it was still more injurious to 
themselves than to us; that this little trade by the means of 



isio] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 383 

American vessels, which had given his government an op 
portunity of laying a transit duty, was the only source of 
revenue left them; but that in Hamburg they had been jeal 
ous of it, and had written to Paris that the Danes were 
carrying on a contraband trade with the English. Upon this, 
France had loaded them with bitter reproaches, altogether 
unmerited. For Denmark had excluded more rigorously 
the English trade than any body. Excepting the outskirts 
of the kingdom in Norway, over which it was impossible for 
the government to have an effectual control, the exclusion of 
English trade had been complete. Denmark had sacrificed 
herself for the common cause, and instead of acknowledgment 
this was the return she had received. She had been forced 
into the war by the treacherous and unprovoked outrages 
of England, and now she was obliged to follow the impulse, 
dictated by France. 

I took this occasion to urge upon the Baron the same senti 
ments in relation to the continental system, and the manner 
in which it is pursued, which I had before suggested to Count 
RomanzofF, to insist upon the absurdity as well as the 
inefficacy of distressing and ruining the rivals of Britain in 
trade, for the purpose of affecting her commerce. I observed 
how ill calculated the oppression of American citizens, and 
the sequestration of American property was to remove jeal 
ousies or suspicions of connivance in a contraband trade with 
the English, and how easily the immense proportion of the 
property belonging to Americans might be ascertained, and 
liberated from all pretence of suspicion as English. That 
as the resentments and the rigor of France were avowedly 
meant only to operate against English trade, the Danish 
government could release all property unquestionably Amer 
ican without danger of offending France, and that the profits 
which they derived from this commerce themselves 3 ought 



384 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

at least to secure to it all the favor, which the government 
could safely bestow upon it. 

If the real object of France in driving the king of Denmark 
into this measure, as pernicious to his own interests, as it is 
contrary to the rights of private property, was merely to 
strike at the contraband commerce with England, the inter 
ference of the Emperor of Russia will, I have no doubt, be 
productive of immediate and the most salutary effects. But 
if, under the cover of a menacing and terrific proscription of 
English trade, is concealed either a trafficking speculation of 
powerful individuals, or a design to lay hands upon all the 
American property to which the grasp of France can extend, 
the Emperor of Russia will have manifested his amicable 
disposition towards the United States, but its efficacy will 
be paralyzed before it can reach the ears of the Danish court. 

There is an obscure rumor in circulation, that by a mutual 
agreement between France and all the northern powers, all 
commerce in the articles commonly denominated colonial 
merchandize will be during the ensuing season interdicted 
throughout the continent of Europe. Such is indeed in all 
probability the law imposed upon Denmark, upon Sweden, 
upon Holland, and upon all the southern part of Europe, as 
far as the power of France extends. That instigations of a 
similar nature have been applied here is not improbable, but 
as the independence of Russia still remains entire, and as the 
interests of the Empire would so deeply suffer by the attempt 
to execute such a project, I hope it will be withstood with 
determination and success. 

This letter, with my two last, goes to Paris, by a gentle 
man, who is to accompany Count Pahlen, to the United 
States. He carries I understand the final instructions to that 
minister, who is to proceed upon his mission as soon as he 
can procure a passage from France to America. I enclose

TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 

No. 10. [ROBERT SMITH] 

ST. PETERSBURG, 17 January, 1810. 
SIR: 

The last letter, which I had the honor of writing you, 
was of the 7th inst. and was forwarded open, under cover to 
General Armstrong, by a courier of Count RomanzofFs, who 
carried the final instructions for Count Pahlen. I ought to 
mention it, as one of the numerous marks of attention, which 
I have received from this minister, that he has kindly offered 
to forward any dispatches, that I may have occasion to send 
by his couriers, with the assurance that he w r ill give me sea 
sonable notice of any that he may send to Paris. 

In my conferences with Count Romanzoff, and with the 
Baron de Blome the Danish minister at this court, on the 
subject of the American cargoes sequestered in the ports of 
Holstein by an order of the king of Denmark, you will have 
observed that it was considered as a measure adopted in con 
sequence of the remonstrances of France; but that its object 
was merely to suppress the commerce carrying on between 
those ports and the English. It seemed however from their 
representations, that the complaint of France had been in 
general terms, but that the particular measure, so far as it 
involved American property, was the act of the Danish 
government itself, adopted merely for the purpose of exam 
ination, to ascertain what was real, from that which was only 
simulated American property. It occurred to me that if 



3 86 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

such was the only purpose of the measure, some observations 
might be suggested to the French government, which might 
tend, if not to accelerate the removal of the sequester, at 
least to guard against the interference of France to prevent 
it. I therefore asked an interview with the Duke de Vicence, 1 
the French ambassador, for which he appointed yesterday 
morning. I then called upon him, stated to him the par 
ticular circumstances of the case, and endeavored to turn 
his attention, not only to the injustice of this operation, as it 
related to the American citizens, whose property was thus 
taken out of their hands, but to the general impolicy of 
measures which broke up all distinctions between the English 
and Americans, or w r hich, still more at war with their pro 
fessed purposes, under color of striking at the English, had 
their effect of rigor only upon the Americans. 

The Ambassador, who very readily admitted the propriety; 
of making this distinction as a general principle, in the first 
instance expressed doubts, whether it was a subject in which 
he could officially take any concern. He observed that it 
was a measure, either concerted with that of his own govern 
ment to prohibit the introduction of British merchandize 
within the line of the French custom houses, or adopted by 
the king of Denmark as of internal regulation within his 
own dominions. That in the former of these suppositions, he 
could not with propriety interfere, to prevent the full effect 
of measures sanctioned by his own government, and in the 
latter, as Denmark was a sovereign and independent state it 
would be equally improper for him to interpose in opposition 
to any ordinances which its government had deemed ex 
pedient. 

To this I replied that in official and diplomatic form I was 
well aware I could ask nothing of him in this case. I neither 

1 Armand-Augustin-Louis de Caulaincourt, due de Vicence (1772-1827). 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 387 

had nor could have any instructions from my own govern 
ment on this occasion; and knowing that he was accredited 
only to the Russian court, and not to that of Denmark, I 
know also that whatever interest he might take in the object 
for which I had desired to converse with him, would arise 
from his personal disposition to oblige, and not from any 
duty attached to his public character. I supposed that the 
same persons, my countrymen, who in the embarrassment 
and distress brought upon them by this sudden and violent 
proceeding had applied to me for such assistance as my situa 
tion might enable me to obtain for them, had also had re 
course to that of the minister of the United States in France, 
in which case he had doubtless addressed directly to the 
French government such representations as the occasion 
had rendered proper. But the point in which I supposed it 
possible that an intimation from him, the Ambassador, to his 
government might be of use, was this: the Danish govern 
ment alleged that this step had been taken at the desire of 
France; but that its sole object was to suppress an illicit 
trade between its subjects and the English. His majesty 
the Emperor of Russia, on a statement of the circumstances 
to him, had been pleased to order a representation of his 
wish to the court of Denmark, that the sequester should 
be removed as speedily as possible from the property really 
American involved in the sweeping regulation of the Danish 
ordinance. If the wishes of France were only pointed against 
the English, a simple intimation from France to Denmark, 
of her acquiescence in the immediate liberation of the prop 
erty really American which had been sequestered, would be 
sufficient, and it was the justice and expediency of this in 
timation of which I wished him to be convinced, and to sug 
gest to his government. 

These observations led us into a general and desultory 



388 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

conversation upon the subject of the continental system, of 
warfare upon English commerce, a subject with the particu 
lars of which the Ambassador appeared not to be thoroughly 
acquainted. From the tenor of his conversation I should 
infer that most if not all the negotiations between France and 
Russia, relative to these objects, are carried on through the 
channel of the Russian embassy at Paris. On this occasion, 
as well as on those of my conversations with Count Roman- 
zofT, with the Baron de Blome, and with Count Soltykoff the 
adjunct minister of foreign affairs, I expressed freely my 
own opinions on the effect of the measures hitherto adopted 
in pursuance of the continental system, referring at the same 
time to the striking and notorious facts from which this 
effect is discernible. The Ambassador as well as those other 
ministers appeared personally convinced of the correctness 
of my remarks, but without expectation that their opinions 
would prevail to influence the system of policy which will 
yet be pursued. 

The Ambassador at the close of this conversation assured 
me that he would make a report of it to his government, 
stating the particular object for which I had applied to him, 
and with his own personal wish that it may be obtained. 

At the commencement of the new year, according to the 
calendar still in use here, which was on Saturday last, some 
important changes in the subordinate organization of this 
government, were introduced. The Imperial Council re 
ceived a new modification, the object of which is a greater 
stability and uniformity in the administration of the Em 
pire. I shall send you a translation of the constitution, 
which appeared yesterday in the Russian and German lan 
guages, but which the time will not allow to be completed, 
by the present opportunity. 

I have the honor, etc.

TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
No. ii. [ROBERT SMITH] 

ST. PETERSBURG, 31 January, 1810. 
SIR: 

On the 2 1st inst. I received a letter from Mr. Jonathan 
Russell at Tonning, enclosing a dispatch from you, which 
contained your favor of 23rd October, and a copy of your 
letter of 9 October to Mr. Jackson. 1 Mr. Russell had sailed 
from Boston the 8th of November, and arrived in the Roads 
below Tonning, the 22nd of December. His vessel 2 and 
cargo immediately came under the new sequestration order 
issued by the king of Denmark, and he wrote me requesting 
all such assistance as might be in my power to give him, to 
obtain their release. 

My late letters have given you an exact account of my 
interviews with the Chancellor Count RomanzofF, with the 
Danish minister Baron de Blome, and with the French Am 
bassador, on the subject of this new vexation of American 
commerce. Since then I have seen in the German newspapers 
of Hamburg, a circular letter of General Armstrong s with a 
letter to him from Mr. Dreyer, the Danish minister at Paris, 
which seems to promise that the sequester upon this prop 
erty shall be removed, as soon as the purpose of examination 
to ascertain that which is bona fide American can be accom 
plished. I entertain the hope that this promise has been 
duly performed; but as importunity sometimes contributes 
to advance the claims of justice, I took the opportunity of 
this new case of Mr. Russell s, to write a letter to the Baron 

1 In American State Papers, Foreign Relations, III. 308. 
z President Adams. 



390 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

de Blome, stating the particular circumstances of it, and re 
newing the application in favor of all the other Americans, 
whose property has been placed in the same predicament. 
This letter together with another concerning the loss of an 
American vessel, in the passage of the Belt, by the firing of 
a Danish battery upon her just as she struck upon a reef, I 
requested the Baron to communicate to his court; which he 
assures me he has accordingly done. 

Mr. Forbes, our consul at Hamburg, is gone to Copen 
hagen upon the same subject. I have a letter from him 
written at Odense in the island of Fiinen, 3 January, in which 
he mentions that he had been under the necessity of demand 
ing the seizure of three American vessels, which had laden 
their cargoes in England. 

Mr. George Joy was already at Copenhagen, as the agent 
for the owners of some vessels and cargoes detained in Nor 
way. He had also, as I understand from letters which he 
has written me, what he considers as an official authority of 
a public nature from Mr. Pinkney the minister of the United 
States at London. He has also requested an authorization 
of a similar nature from me; but having no authority from 
the government of the United States upon this subject my 
self, I can delegate none to any other person; and if the 
confidence of the President in Mr. Joy s character and quali 
fications induces him to give a regular authority to his rep 
resentations, they will be more efficaciously as well as more 
properly supported by credentials from the United States, 
than by the assumption of a power by me, which has not 
been entrusted to me. 1 

The Boston Packet, a vessel which sailed the 6th of Decem 
ber from Boston, arrived at Tonning the 3rd or 4th of Jan 
uary. She brought newspapers containing the circular letter 

1 See Writings of Madison (Hunt), VIII. 8571. 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 391 

of Mr. Jackson to the British consuls of 13 November * and 
also the President s message to Congress at the opening of 
the session. The personal character of Mr. Jackson is well 
known to many persons here, and the tone of his negotiations, 
not only in Denmark, but at Berlin, has been marked by 
such peculiar features, that the opinion entertained by the 
persons of the best information in the recent diplomatic 
transactions in Europe is, that the person was selected for 
the service, and that his conduct will be countenanced and 
supported by his own government. This opinion is strength 
ened, by the prospects of Mr. Canning s return into the Brit 
ish ministry, the report of which has become prevalent. 2 The 
expectation of an immediate war between the United States 
and England has given great alarm not only to the Americans 
who are here, but to all the commercial part of this city. 
This however is not their only apprehension. On the one 
hand it is generally believed that the Emperor of France, 
adhering to a system the inefficacy of which has long been 
demonstrated even to his most confidential advisers, will 
persist in renewing the experiment of totally annihilating 
the commerce between the British Islands and the continent 
of Europe; and that during the ensuing season, no importa 
tions will be allowed into any ports of the continent which 
by possibility might come from England. On the other it is 
feared that the British government .will at the opening of 
the spring declare all the ports of the Baltic in a state of 
blockade. Reports of a general embargo to be laid here are 
also in circulation. Much of all this is undoubtedly com 
mercial speculation. There is every appearance that during 
the present year the shackles and the oppressions upon com 
merce will be still greater than they have been during the

two last, and there is too much probability that almost all 
the advantage of this state of things, and far the smallest 
portion of sufferings resulting from it, will befall Great 
Britain. 

Proposals for negotiation have undoubtedly been made 
from France to the British government; and it has been in 
timated to me that even a basis was offered, which it was 
supposed would be acceptable including the restoration 
of Portugal, and of Spain as far as the river Ebro, to their 
former sovereigns; provided the supremacy of France over 
Italy, the part of Spain within the Ebro, and the extension of 
the northern frontier of France to the Maas, should be recog 
nized by England. It is added however that these proposals 
have been rejected. 

With this letter I have the honor to enclose a translation 
of the imperial manifesto, and new constitution of the Coun 
cil of the Russian Empire, issued at the commencement of 
the present year. It is variously considered by different per 
sons, as a new system of government, containing many fea 
tures of freedom and calculated to temper the absoluteness 
of the sovereign authority; as an imitation of the present 
organization of the French government, recommended by 
the energy which experience has shown it to possess there; 
or as merely a mode of removing certain ministers, with 
whom the Emperor is not altogether satisfied, but whom he 
does not choose to disgrace, and of concentrating power and 
influence in the present Chancellor of the Empire, Count 
Romanzoff. Upon him the appointment of President Gen 
eral of the Council, in the absence of the Emperor, has been 
conferred for the present year. And the office next in dig 
nity, that of Secretary of the Empire, is at the same time be 
stowed upon Mr. Speransky, 1 a person whose reputation for

talents stands very high, and who has risen under the favor 
of Count RomanzofFs particular friendship and influence. 
He is the reputed author of several public manifestoes and 
other state papers, the composition of which has excited 
notice in the United States, as well as throughout Europe. 
I have the honor, etc. 



TO ABIGAIL ADAMS 

ST. PETERSBURG, 8 February, 1810. 
MY DEAR MOTHER: 

The Sunday before we embarked for this place, my excel 
lent friend and Pastor Emerson delivered in his pulpit a 
discourse upon the pleasing and not improbable doctrine of a 
guardian angel, which Christians have often supposed to be 
assigned to every individual to watch over him, and as far 
as is consistent with the general designs of providence, to 
guide his conduct, and to preserve him from extraordinary 
dangers. My wife and her sister, who were present and 
heard this discourse, were much affected by it, and naturally 
made an application of several passages in it to ourselves in 
the great voyage then just before us. I was prevented from 
attendance on Mr. Emerson s public ministration that day 
by having gone out for the last time before our departure to 
spend the day with you at Quincy. But I hope at some future 
day to have the pleasure and benefit of reading it, and in the 
meantime I dwell with pleasure upon its principal idea. The 
general superintendence of the Creator and Governor of the 
Universe is indeed sufficient for the preservation and well 
being of all his creatures, but in the greatness and multitude 
of evils and of perils which surround a wanderer upon the 
face of the terraqueous globe, the heart, if not the judgment, 



394 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

feels the want of some special protection ; of some intermedi 
ate agent possessed of powers and attributes, superior indeed 
to those of human nature, but yet limited in their extent and 
capable of confinement to exclusive objects. 

From the day when we embarked from Mr. Gray s wharf 
in Charlestown, until that when we landed opposite that of 
Peter the Great at St. Petersburg, we were exposed to many 
great and imminent dangers. I have given a minute account 
of them all in several letters to my brother, which I trust will 
all have been perused by you before this will come to your 
hands. When in the midst of them, and knowing that human 
power was inadequate to extricate us from them, there was 
more hope and consolation in the belief of being under the 
peculiar charge of a superior, though a finite, spirit, than in 
the philosophical conviction, that all partial evil is universal 
good, and that whatever might befall us, the system of the 
universe would enjoy an equal portion of felicity. 

A beneficent providence, whether operating by general 
laws or by the subordinate energy and care of a guardian 
angel, did conduct us safely through all these perils, and 
brought us to the end of our outward voyage, after a naviga 
tion of nearly three months duration. We reached St. Peters 
burg the 23 rd of October, the day before which I had written 
you a few lines from Cronstadt, which I hope you have before 
this received. 

The American vessels which sailed three or four days after 
wards, and by one of which that short letter was forwarded, 
was the last which could get away before the port was blocked 
up with ice. This occurred about three weeks after our ar 
rival, and several letters which we had already sent to 
Cronstadt, to go by vessels ready to sail, were sent back 
to us, the vessels having found it impracticable to get 
out. 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 395 

Since that time I have sent to Holland, France and Eng 
land, dispatches and letters for America, without knowing 
how or when they would find a conveyance. It is not im 
probable that this, which is the first I have written you 
from this place, and which I yet know not how I shall send, 
will find its way to Quincy as soon as any of the rest. I 
should have written you repeatedly, but the tumultuous 
agitation of the life which we have led since our arrival here, 
which has not yet entirely subsided, has scarcely left me 
time for the most indispensable of my duties. 

You are acquainted with the difficulty and the expense of 
of forming a suitable domestic establishment for an American 
minister in other parts of Europe. They are everywhere 
great. Here they are greater than anywhere else. We are 
still indifferently lodged at a public house, and very ex 
pensively. A furnished house or apartments are not to be 
had. The bare walls of a single floor or house, which would 
but just contain my family, must be paid at a rent of fifteen 
hundred or two thousand dollars, that is six or seven thou 
sand rubles a year, and they cannot be so much as decently 
furnished at less than five times the highest of these sums. 
The attendance at court is frequent, and of the most indis 
pensable obligation. It is most frequently twice in a day, 
the morning at a levee, and the same evening at a ball and 
supper. Not a particle of the clothing I brought with me 
have I been able to present myself in, and the cost of a lady s 
dress is far more expensive, and must be more diversified 
than that of a man. The number of servants which must 
be kept is at least treble that which is necessary elsewhere, 
and the climate of the country requires for every individual 
expenses of clothing unknown in more southern regions. 
These are burthens from which no resolution can escape. 
But there are many others more ruinous, and avoidable 



396 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

only by the sacrifice of all consideration among the people 
of the country. The tone of society among us is almost 
universally marked by an excess of expenses over income. 
The public officers all live far beyond their salaries, many of 
them are notorious for never paying their debts, and still 
more for preserving the balance by means which in our 
country would be deemed dishonorable, but which are here 
much less disreputable than economy. 

I will not dwell upon this subject. You will readily con 
ceive the embarrassment in which I find myself, and of the 
desire which I feel to get out of a situation irksome beyond 
expression. I have engaged part of a house, and am now on 
the point of furnishing it. I shall be obliged to involve my 
self in debt and to draw upon my little property in America, 
even to do this. But then I should show you the bright side 
of the situation too. We have dinners, and balls, and sup 
pers, and ice-hill parties, and masquerades, almost without 
end. We are going, for instance, this evening to a mas 
querade ball at the French Ambassador s, to begin at ten 
o clock. How much I am delighted with all this is unneces 
sary for me to say, nor how congenial it is to my temper to 
find extravagance and dissipation become a public duty. I 
hope, however, and I have great pleasure in expressing the 
hope to you, that not only myself but all the younger part 
of my family will preserve steadiness of brain in this sudden 
and violent whirl, to come out of it still in possession of our 
purses and our reason. But we all to begin with myself need 
the care of the guardian angel, more than we did in the Baltic 
or the Gulf of Finland.

TO THOMAS BOYLSTON ADAMS 

ST. PETERSBURG, 14 February, 1810. 

Upon the politics of Europe, or upon those of America, I 
scarcely know what to write you, nor would it perhaps be 
discreet to write what would be most interesting for you to 
read. Situated here at the northern extremity of Europe, we 
are almost as distant from the places, where the events most 
remarkable for the world are occurring, and imprisoned al 
most constantly from the time of our arrival and still for six 
months, to be so in thrilling regions of thick ribbed ice, we 
are almost as long in receiving intelligence from the scene of 
important action as yourselves. We only knew very lately, 
as before this I suppose you know in America, that there is a 
negotiation on foot between France and England, but with 
little expectation on either part that it will terminate in a 
peace. Unhappily for mankind the present state of the world 
exhibits the singular phenomenon of two great powers, op 
pressing the whole species under the color of a war against 
each other. France and England can do very little harm 
comparatively speaking to each other. But the armed 
legions of France lay the continent of Europe under the 
most enormous contributions to support and enrich them, 
while the naval force of England extorts the same tribute 
from the commerce of the world. The mass of the people 
both in France and England suffers in common with those 
of other countries, but the fashion of paying any regard to 
the interests of the people is almost abandoned even in 
pretence. When we were last in Europe a sort of republican 
or democratic spirit was prevalent, not only in the official 
pretensions and varying constitutions of France, but in the 



398 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

political and literary character of the times. It is scarcely 
conceivable what a change in this respect has taken place. 
There is not a republic left in Europe. The very name of the 
people is everywhere buried in oblivion. In England the 
great concerns upon which all the passions of the country 
concentrate themselves, are intrigues and cabals of princes 
and ministers to supplant one another, and the prices of 
seats at the playhouse. In France and the rest of Europe 
king-making and king-breaking, orders of chivalry and dis 
solutions of marriage, blanchisseusses, princesses and Jacobin 
grubs bursting into butterfly princes, dukes and counts, 
conscriptions and contributions, famine grinding the people 
into soldiers, soldiers sprouting into sultans, fifty or sixty 
upstarts wallowing in more than Asiatic luxury, and an iron 
harrow tearing up the bowels of the nations. This is the 
present history of the times. 

The country where we now are has perhaps undergone the 
least change of any in Europe since I last saw it, and that 
change has been for the better. The Emperor Alexander, 
whom the English fame-blowers once extolled to the skies, 
and whom they now vainly attempt to degrade, is a char 
acter highly distinguished among the sovereigns of the world. 
Young, handsome and elegant in his person, affable and 
condescending in his manners, he possesses qualities yet more 
important and more commendable in a powerful and absolute 
prince. This spirit of benevolence and humanity is so strong 
and so universally recognized, that they who wish to censure 
him can only complain that this disposition implies a defect 
of energy. How far this may be founded I have not the 
means of judging, but I know that his character is not desti 
tute of firmness and perseverance. This system of policy 
since the peace with France 1 has been very steadily pur-

sued, though undoubtedly contrary to the passions and 
prejudices of almost all the persons by whom he is sur 
rounded. It has, indeed, been hitherto remarkably success 
ful, and the English party now has consequently lost much 
of its strength. Still, however, it would predominate but 
for his steadiness and decision. This regard for our country, 
which he has manifested upon many occasions, and in one 
very recent instance as I have mentioned to you, is a proof 
not less of wisdom than of goodness. It indicates a mind 
capable of appreciating distant objects and remote conse 
quences, one of the rarest and most valuable consequences 
that a statesman can possess. It has extended the bounds of 
his Empire, though, as he himself said to me, it is already 
too large; but his new acquisitions have certainly con 
tributed to its security, as well as its extent. . . . 



TO GEORGE JOY 

ST. PETERSBURG, 19 February, 1810. 
SIR: 

Since I last wrote you by Mr. Berry, the second mate of 
the bark William Gray, I have received your favor of 9 Jan 
uary, inclosing the letter from our friend Mr. Williams, 1 
of which you had previously transmitted to me a copy, and 
containing the questions respecting the prospects df trade 
to and from this country, which in your preceding letter you 
had intimated to me the intention of forwarding to me. 

These questions I regret that it is not in my power to 
answer so confidently, as to furnish a solid foundation for 
your communications to your correspondents in America. 
It is rather from America or from England that the destinies

of commerce during the present year are to be learnt, than 
from Russia. We are still ignorant here what the course of 
the British government towards the United States will be 
since the termination of Mr. Jackson s mission. We are still 
more ignorant what will be the course pursued by the United 
States. The newspapers inform us that the frigate John 
Adams, after landing her money at Amsterdam, is to proceed 
to Copenhagen, so that I presume you will receive by her 
direct intelligence from our government upon which you can 
place more reliance than upon any I can give you. 

As to this country you are doubtless acquainted with the 
fact, that notwithstanding the rigorous prohibition of com 
mercial intercourse with England, the quantity of Russian 
produce exported to the British islands in the course of the 
last year was greater than ever was known in any one year 
before. But while the trade of export has been only for 
bidden, that of import has been in a great measure pre 
vented, and the balance has been very large against England. 
It is not improbable that you have penetrated the real policy 
of France in favoring this state of things, which perhaps may 
be still more encouraged the present year than it has been 
the last. But how far this system as it operates will suit the 
British government appears not yet very clear. The minis 
terial pamphleteers and Sir Francis D lvernois insist upon it, 
that England prospers under it to such a degree that her only 
danger is of perishing of plethora. It may be so, and perhaps 
they think it more agreeable to perish by plethora than by 
famine. But if his adversaries are willing to drown them 
selves in a butt of Malmsey, I suppose Napoleon will not 
very seriously dispute with them the choice of their mode of 
submission. But Mr. Jackson has told our government, that 
there was no longer any motive in the British government 
for adhering to their former Orders of Council of November, 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 401 

1807, and perhaps they have found by this time as little rea 
son to be satisfied with the effect of the Order of 1809. This 
freedom of importation and obstruction of export may answer 
very well at the custom house, but neither the nation nor 
the government can be easy under it long. The merchants 
here are apprehensive that the impediments to their com 
merce will come from English regulation; that licenses will 
be refused, that the Baltic will be blockaded, or that there 
will be war between England and the United States. You 
are so much nearer the sources of information upon these 
subjects than I am, that I must expect it from instead of 
giving it to you. I am, etc. 

TO WILLIAM EUSTIS 

ST. PETERSBURG, 28 February, 1810. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

A few days since I was gratified with the receipt of your 
very obliging favor of I October from Boston, inclosing the 
letter to you from General [Wade] Hampton, with a number 
of questions respecting the cultivation and management of 
hemp in this country, to which I shall pay the most particular 
attention. 1 I shall find no difficulty in procuring satisfactory 

1 So also Henry Dearborn, of Massachusetts, asked some questions about Siberian 
wheat. "Since my arrival in this country, I have made frequent inquiries, and of 
various persons likely to be the best informed upon the subject, respecting the 
Siberian wheat. I have learnt with some surprise, not only that no peculiar species 
of that grain is cultivated in the province, but that it scarcely produces any wheat 
at all; and that the greatest part of the article consumed by its inhabitants is im 
ported from other parts of the Empire, and from Poland. It is added that the 
practice of kiln drying is universal, applied to all the wheat raised in every part of 
this country, and that none other could be obtained, unless by having it raised for 
the special purpose. The Province of Siberia is, indeed, so remote from this capital, 
that I meet with scarcely anybody who knows much about it. The virtuosi who 
collect cabinets of curiosities, speak of it as a land of rocks and minerals. The 



4 02 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

answers to all these questions, but I am afraid it will be im 
possible to procure the two men as the general desires. A 
general law of the country prohibits the expatriation of all 
Russian subjects, and the condition of the people practically 
acquainted with the cultivation of hemp, like that of almost 
all the people of this country, is to be appendages to the soil. 
This principle is so rooted in their constitution, that a con 
veyance of land implies the conveyance of its occupiers, and 
that the occupiers cannot legally be sold without the land. 
Hence too the estimation and description of lands is drawn 
not from admeasurement, but from the number of the 
peasants annexed, and I see almost every day in the gazette 
lands advertised for sale of so many persons instead of so 
many acres. . . . 

Your letter was forwarded to me from Gothenburg. Since 
receiving it we have had by various other occasions intelli 
gence from America down to the commencement of the 
present year. The appearance of our affairs both with Eng 
land and France wear a very serious aspect again. The king 
of Great Britain, however, in his speech at the opening of 
the present session of Parliament says, 1 he is still willing to 
negotiate with us; the change of the British Minister of 
foreign affairs may possibly have produced some change of 
temper in the cabinet towards America; but if Canning has 
been restored, as it is here reported, there is no prospect of 
any adjustment of our differences with that country. 

The conduct of France towards us continues to be equally 
offensive and injurious, though under forms less insulting 
than those of the English. The Emperor Napoleon is said to 

politicians are acquainted with it as a land of exile; but excepting that it contains 
malachite and malefactors there is very little more generally known about it here 
than in Boston." To Henry Dearborn y April 25, 1810.

pursue this policy against the opinions of all his ministers. 
There is perhaps something of personal feeling in this. He 
doubtless knows that his own character is not much es 
teemed in America, and he has no affection for republics. 
He told some deputation that was sent to him the other day, 
that monarchy was as necessary to France as the sun to the 
system of the universe. 

He has been making propositions for peace to the British 
government, and is said to have offered to restore Portugal 
and Spain as far north as the river Ebro to their proper sov 
ereigns, and for the rest to treat upon the basis of the uti 
possidetis. He probably knows that these terms will be re 
jected by England, but he intends it as a preliminary to his 
project of extending the bounds of France to the Maas on 
the north, and to the Ebro on the south. With this he in 
tends also to unite his kingdom of Italy, and then to assume 
a new imperial dignity. This is not all. He has conceived 
the idea that heroes like himself are a species susceptible of 
being propagated, and that he only wants a suitable wife to 
produce a Napoleon the second, whom he can train up in his 
own principles for the benefit of mankind. He has therefore 
obtained the dissolution of his marriage with the Empress 
Josephine, and the politicians of Europe are lost in the depth 
of conjecture, who is the princess that is to bear the future 
ruler of the western empire. 

^^ou will perceive by the dispatches which I have trans- 
mitted to the Secretary of State since my arrival here, that 
the disposition of the Emperor of Russia towards the United 
States affords a happy contrast with those of France and 
England. Of this disposition you will find that something 
more than mere profession has been shown, and perhaps it 
would be prudent to avail ourselves of the present moment 
to secure by a commercial treaty advantages which it may 



404 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

not always be in our power to obtain. The relations between 
this country and ours have been regarded with an eye of 
rivalry and of jealousy by the British, and their influence 
here in ordinary times will always be, as it has heretofore 
been, exerted against us. 

There is certainly not in the Russian empire a person 
possessing sentiments so strongly favorable to the United 
States as the Chancellor Count Romanzoff, as there is with 
equal certainty none so highly in the personal confidence of 
the Emperor. This reputation for integrity is beyond all 
reproach; but as his system of policy is anti-Britannic, he is 
most notoriously hated by all the British party in this coun 
try. This party among the high nobility is numerous and 
powerful, though its influence is perfectly lifeless so long as 
the will of the sovereign is opposed to it. If any circum 
stances should occur to remove Count Romanzoff from the 
principal direction of affairs, we should lose in him a very 
valuable friend. The personal good will of the Emperor, too, 
from the frequent occasions upon which he has manifested it, 
and the manner in which the sense of it has been received and 
acknowledged by the American government, has acquired in 
his mind the force of a sentiment, and the increasing inter 
course between the countries will, I hope, contribute to give 
it additional strength. I could wish that a moment so favor 
able might be improved to the permanent advantage of our 
country. If we suffer it to pass away, a century may not 
give us such another. 

22 March, 1810. 

It is no longer uncertain who is to be the Empress of 
France. To the utter amazement of all Europe the lot has 
fallen upon an Austrian archduchess, the eldest daughter of 
the Emperor Francis. The consequences of this new alliance 
are expected to be as important to the future destinies of the 



is io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 405 

European continent, as they will be fatal to the influence 
of Great Britain. 

The English government have rejected the propositions 
for a negotiation of peace, and French troops are taking 
possession of Holland. What the object of the war now is to 
England is not easy to discover. Spain is gone. Portugal 
she still talks of defending but will soon evacuate; the exclu 
sion of their commerce from the continent of Europe will be 
attempted with renewed vigor, and the war upon all com 
merce according to all appearances will be more unrelenting 
than it has been at any period hitherto. 

The letters from M. de Champagny to the Dutch Minister 
of Foreign Affairs and to General Armstrong x sufficiently 
indicate the inflexibility with which the continental system 
will be pursued by France. They seem to put the only ques 
tion of the war upon the Orders of Council of Novem 
ber, 1807, and upon the point of Proclamation blockades, for 
the legality of real blockades is expressly recognized. I have, 
indeed, understood from good authority that in the plan of 
pacification concerted between France and Russia, no aban 
donment of any principle maintained of ancient time by 
England would be required of her. She would even probably 
be left in possession of Malta, the peppercorn for which she 
thought proper to go to war. But if she still intends to fight 
down the aggrandizement of France as M. Champagny says, 
the war will be long. I am, etc. 

1 "The French newspapers have given to the world the late letter of the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs to you. It would seem that if this publicity of negotiation is 
intended for the purpose of operating upon public opinion, it would be marked with 
something like reciprocity, and that both sides of the correspondence should be 
exhibited. It might, however, be of little use to us to have the best of the argument 
in print, unless with words as mild and with propositions as plausible as those ad 
dressed to you, we could at the same time sell as many vessels and cargoes au 
benefice du Fisc." To John Armstrong, March 24, 1810. Ms. Champagny s letter

TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 

No. 12. [ROBERT SMITH] 

ST. PETERSBURG, 24 March, 1810. 
SIR: 

I have received the letter which you did me the honor to 
write me on the 4th of December last, together with the 
copies of your dispatches to Mr. Pinkney of II November, 
and to General Armstrong of I December, 1 and three copies 
of the President s message, and the documents relative to the 
negotiations with France and England published by order 
of the House of Representatives. 

These papers were forwarded to me by General Armstrong 
and were brought from Paris by a courier dispatched by the 
Russian Ambassador, Prince Kurakin, to Count RomanzorT. 
I sent the Count a copy of the message and documents, and 
a few days afterwards had an interview with him, in which 
he told me that the Baron de Blome, the Danish minister 
had communicated to him the answer of his court, to the 
application made by order of the Emperor, for the release of 
the American vessels and property which had been se 
questered in the ports of Holstein. This answer was, that 
the Danish government would pay the most particular at 
tention to the interest which the Emperor had taken upon 
this occasion; that they would give all possible dispatch to 
the proceedings; and that their own wishes were entirely 
conformable to the desire of the Emperor manifested upon 
this subject. The Count expressed his satisfaction that the 
opportunity which the Emperor had thus taken to show his 

to Armstrong, February 14, 1810, is in American State Papers, Foreign Relations, 
III. 380.

i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 407 

friendship for the United States had been attended with this 
success. He regretted that the commerce of the United 
States elsewhere appeared still to be subject to seizures and 
ill-treatment, and that altogether it seemed impossible there 
should be any safe commerce until the peace. That the 
profligacy with which the English, under at least the obvious 
connivance of their government were attempting to carry 
on their trade with fraud and forgery was such as he could 
not reflect upon without astonishment. The English were 
a nation illustrious by the men of genius and learning, dis 
tinguished in the arts and sciences whom they had produced, 
illustrious by the degree of power and importance in the 
affairs of the world, which they had attained. Their com 
merce also had been very extensive, and although it was 
known that in their commercial intercourse with others their 
activity and enterprize gave them advantages, of which they 
were always eager to make the most they could; that they 
would make those with whom they would treat commit as 
many faults as they could lead them into, and turn them 
with all their ingenuity and address to their own benefit. In 
short that they had an extraordinary talent at making profit 
able bargains, yet there was a sort of integrity to the reputa 
tion of which they had always aspired, and which they had 
acquired. A British merchant had been considered as a 
man of principle, who would disdain for the mere profits of 
trade to participate in a base or infamous transaction. But 
now, said the Count, I will give you a sample of what are 
the principles of British merchants. There arrived in our 
ports last autumn thirteen ships and cargoes, which entered 
as coming from the port of Lisbon, under neutral colors. 
Among the documents which they exhibited was a certificate 
of origin apparently under the hand and seal of the Russian 
consul at Lisbon. This gentleman has long been personally 



4 o8 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

well known to me, and I have a high esteem for his character 
and good conduct; in which point of view I have often men 
tioned him to the Emperor himself. I had no reason on 
seeing these certificates of origin to doubt from the appear 
ance of the hand or seal, of their authenticity; but as the 
vessels have been detained here over winter by the ice, and 
as I had time in that interval to get an answer from him, I 
took good measures to get a letter transmitted to him, with 
a list of these vessels, and of the documents apparently ex 
ecuted by him and an enquiry whether these were all au 
thentic. I have lately received his answer, and not one of 
the documents is genuine. The whole thirteen are forgeries. 
Now I ask, what difference in principle there is between this 
case, and the same transaction upon the seal of a deed or the 
signature of a bill of exchange? And what is one to think of 
a government which licenses people to trade on such docu 
ments? He then continued that the charge des affaires of 
the Queen of Portugal had urgently insisted for the admis 
sion of Portuguese vessels from Lisbon. This was impossible. 
The Emperor had made no change in his relations with Portu 
gal. He was not at war with Portugal, he continued to receive 
Mr. Navarro as the Queen s charge des affaires. Portuguese 
vessels from Brazil, or elsewhere, not enemy s ports, would be 
freely admitted; but from places notoriously in possession of 
the English, it could not be, without making a burlesque of 
the imperial ordinances against trading with the English. 

On some allusion that I made to the conduct of the French 
government and its dependencies towards the United States, 
which I told him would powerfully negotiate in America in 
favor of England, he asked me whether I knew that Colonel 
Burr was gone to Paris. 1 I said I had heard he was arrived 

1 Burr had reached Paris February 16. The Private Journal of Aaron Burr, 
printed by W. K. Bixby, is silent upon an application for a passport to Russia. 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 409 

there. He said he did not know of his arrival; but that he 
knew from a certain source that he was gone there. He said 
Colonel Burr had written a letter to him requesting per 
mission to come here; but that not being desirous of encour 
aging people who had fled from the violated laws of their 
own country, to come into this, he had not answered his 
letter. If he wanted to come here he must make his ap 
plication through the minister of the United States, at whose 
request he would have been readily admitted. The Count 
added some enquiries respecting the project heretofore 
undertaken by Colonel Burr, and from all his conversation 
taken together, it appeared to me to be his impression that 
this project was not yet altogether abandoned. Some of the 
English newspapers have asserted in positive terms that the 
Colonel had proposed to the French government a plan for 
effecting a separation of the States; that he had while in 
England made the same proposition to the British ministry 
with the declared purpose of making it if rejected by them 
to France. It does not appear from whose confidence the 
publishers of these paragraphs obtained their information. 
If overtures of this nature were really made by Mr. Burr to 
the British ministers, you have doubtless more unequivocal 
intelligence of them than through the medium of newspaper 
secrets. Mr. Burr s movements from England to Sweden, 
and thence through Denmark, Hamburg, and Frankfort to 
Paris, have been watched and noted by the governments of 
Europe, as well as by the publishers of newspapers; and from 
the repeated mention made of him to me by Count Roman- 
zoff, I am persuaded that he considers him as a person still 
entitled to attention. 

Since I saw the Count, he has concluded with Mr. Navarro, 
the Portuguese charge des affaires, a convention renewing 
for one year the treaty between Portugal and Russia, which 



4 io THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

had expired; but with the modification which the Count in 
his conversation with me had mentioned as necessary; that 
is, that the admission of Portuguese vessels is confined to 
those which come from Brazil, or the American dominions 
of Portugal, and does not extend to the ports of the European 
kingdom. 

I have the honor to enclose copies of a note, which I 
received some time since from Count RomanzofT, and of my 
answer, which a severe indisposition prevented me from 
sending to him until the time of its date. It is much to be 
lamented that the misconduct of any of our citizens should 
have such a tendency to counteract the friendly dispositions 
of the Emperor; and the repetition of any such outrage 
would certainly lead to measures of restriction upon all Amer 
icans coming into this country, which would subject them 
to serious inconveniences. If this Captain Arnold can be 
brought to answer for his conduct on this occasion, by any 
constitutional process in our tribunals, the nature of his 
offence deserves the most exemplary punishment. But en 
tertaining doubts, both with regard to the point of jurisdic 
tion, and to the means of proof w T hich would be necessary 
for his conviction, I have avoided in my answer leading to 
the expectation of a positive prosecution of Captain Arnold 
in the United States. Perhaps the Emperor may be satis 
fied with this, but I have to request the President s instruc 
tions what I am to answer further upon the subject; particu 
larly if the Count should recur to it again hereafter. 

I have the honor, etc.

TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 

No. 13. [ROBERT SMITH] 

ST. PETERSBURG, 30 March, 1810. 
SIR: 

A few days since I received from a Mr. Sicard, a merchant 
established at Odessa, a letter informing me of the arrival 
at that place of an American vessel, the Calumet, Captain 
Holms, from Constantinople, having on board a Mr. Green, 
who had written to me from Constantinople, but whose letter 
has not yet come to my hands. Captain Holms it appears 
was the bearer of a letter of recommendation from Mr. 
Daschkoff to the Duke de Richelieu, the Governor of Odessa. 
The French consul at that place in the first instance mani 
fested some suspicion that the Calumet was an English vessel, 
with simulated American colors, but is stated to have been 
satisfied, on information of the letter from Mr. DaschkofF. 

It is stated that this vessel is the first which has ever dis 
played the flag of the United States, upon the Black Sea. 
Mr. Sicard mentions that he expects in the course of a few 
days the arrival of another vessel, commanded by a Captain 
Ropes, from Constantinople. By what means they obtained 
admission to Constantinople, and to navigate the Black Sea, 
I have not been informed. Probably the letter from Mr. 
Green which I have not received contained an explanation 
of this event. 

By the note from Count RomanzofT, of which I have the 
honor to enclose herewith a copy, you will perceive the 
light in which this circumstance is viewed by the Russian 
government. The establishment at Odessa is an object of 
peculiar interest and favor to the Emperor Alexander, and 
if a free access to the navigation of the United States could 



4 i2 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

be obtained and secured upon the Black Sea, it would un 
doubtedly open a new and most important source of profit 
to the commerce of our country. 

At the close of my answer to Count RomanzofFs note, a 
copy of which is likewise enclosed, I requested a personal 
interview with him; for which he appointed the ensuing 
morning. My objects in wishing a conversation with him, 
related to the case of an American vessel and cargo, which, 
have been seized and condemned at Archangel, for infrac 
tions of the imperial ukase of 9 May, 1809, the owner of 
which, Mr. George Cutts, has passed the winter here, and 
the restitution of whose property I was desirous if possible 
of obtaining; and also to intelligence recently received from 
Copenhagen, that a large number of privateers are fitting 
out in the ports of Denmark, and that a new privateering 
ordinance is to be issued by the government of that country. 
This information has given great alarm to the Americans 
now here, and who are preparing to return to the United 
States at the opening of the navigation. Though I do not 
apprehend that there will be much danger of molestation 
from that quarter to vessels going from this country, and 
out of the Baltic, yet as undoubtedly vessels coming hither, 
especially if laden with what are termed colonial articles, 
will be intercepted by the Danish privateers, if they should 
again issue with the authority of their government, I wished 
if possible to engage the influence of this government to 
secure the freedom of our navigation to its ports. 

Mr. Cutts s vessel, the Intercourse, 1 entered at Archangel 
as coming from the port of Bilbao, but it appeared upon the 
examination of the commissioners, that she came last from 
Gothenburg; and she entered before the conclusion of the 

1 Sailing from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in February, 1807. 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 413 

peace, between Sweden and Russia. 1 She was also not pro 
vided with a role d equipage, or muster roll, duly authenti 
cated to prove the neutrality of her company. The sentence 
of the commissioners also mentions, that Mr. Cutts had no 
passport for himself. These were certainly causes for con 
demnation conformably to the imperial ordinance. Mr. 
Harris had some time since presented a note to Count 
Romanzoff, claiming the restitution of the property on the 
ground of right. In my conversation with the Count I en 
deavored without abandoning that to bespeak a disposition 
of indulgence. The want of so material a paper as the at 
tested muster roll, and the entrance from an enemy s port, 
in direct contravention against the law of the Empire leave 
but little prospect of success to the application upon either 
principle; and although Count Romanzoff has promised to 
give the subject due consideration, I have no doubt but that 
the property will remain finally condemned. 

I mentioned to the Count the intelligence from Copen 
hagen, that a new swarm of privateers was fitting out, and 
that a new sanction for their depredations was about to issue 
from their government. I suggested to him the apprehension 
that they might even obstruct the passage of our vessels 
going home from the ports of this country, and that they 
probably would arrest many on their way hither coming 
from America. And the freedom of this commerce being 
no less advantageous to the interests of Russia than of the 
United States, I observed that an intimation from this gov 
ernment to the court of Denmark, of an expectation that 
the avenues to the Russian ports, would not be stopped to 
the lawful commerce of neutrals, might prevent the excesses 
which the experience of the last year has given too much 
reason to expect from Danish privateers. The Count said 

1 September 17, 1809. Annual Register, 1809, 784. 



4 i 4 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

that if the passage of vessels lawfully trading and coming to 
this country or going from it should be impeded, this gov 
ernment might indeed address reclamations to the court of 
Denmark; but he did not see the possibility of making any 
remonstrance of that nature, by way of anticipation, or of 
stating an objection against the issuing of commissions to 
privateers, or of an ordinance for their regulation. He 
added that if this step should be taken by the Danish gov 
ernment, it would undoubtedly be at the instigation of 
France, in which case, a remonstrance from elsewhere could 
not much avail; that he lamented the distressing situation of 
commerce in general, but that there was no remedy for it, 
but in a general peace. England and France in the pursuit 
of their measures appeared equally violent and inflexible, 
and no relaxation on either side was to be expected until 
they could come to terms of peace. 

The remainder of the conversation was relative to the 
general state of affairs, 1 and to the probability of a negotia 
tion for peace, of which the Count appears to be extremely 
desirous; which the interest of Russia very forcibly requires; 
but which from the composition of the British ministry the 
Count considers as yet very distant. By the late accounts 
from England, it is probable that some change in the min 
istry will soon take place, but he sees no appearance of such 
a change as will lead to peace a mere change of men; 
without that essential change of political system, to which 
England must come before any rational hopes of peace can 
be entertained. If the change should bring in Mr. Canning, 
it would only make the continuance of the war more cer 
tain. Even if Lord Grenville and Lord Grey should come in 
at the head of a new ministry, the prospect in his opinion 
would not be much more favorable. Lord Grenville he

thinks, only disapproves the mode of carrying on war by 
expeditions, and if he should be at the head of affairs, would 
recur to his old system of fighting with subsidies. 

Whether any relaxation of the system pursued for the last 
two years, is to be expected from Great Britain, is yet un 
certain. That of France is more violent, and more deter 
mined than ever. From every measure of the French gov 
ernment since their last peace with Austria, it is apparent 
that in order to prevent the trade between Great Britain 
and the continent, it will not be suffered in any vessels, of any 
nation. The confiscations of American vessels and their 
cargoes which have lately taken place in Spain, and Naples as 
well as in France, are but the indications of the fate which 
will await our commerce, in every part of the European con 
tinent. I trust there will yet be an exception for those 
which may reach the ports of Russia; but if Denmark should 
again commission her privateers, the Baltic will be closed 
against our trade almost as effectually as the other European 
seas.

416 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 

No. 14. [ROBERT SMITH] 

ST. PETERSBURG, 19 April, 1810. 
SIR: 

Since I had the honor of writing you last, I have had no 
further direct information concerning the American vessel 
which had arrived at Odessa. The letter which Mr. Green 
the supercargo of the vessel had written me from Constanti 
nople has not come to hand, but by a subsequent letter from 
the same gentleman to Mr. Harris I learn that the necessities 
of the Turkish government arising from the scarcity of grain 
at Constantinople had procured the admission of this vessel 
and of several others to the Black Sea. A Turkish merchant 
had contracted to obtain twenty cargoes of wheat at Odessa, 
if the Russian government should permit exportation; and 
as a neutral flag was necessary to secure admission into the 
Russian ports, this and some other American vessels were 
engaged for the purpose, and with the assent of the Porte, 
proceeded into the Black Sea. On their arrival at Odessa, 
however, they found the exportation of grain to the Turkish 
dominions prohibited, and are therefore unable to perform 
that part of the contract in consideration of which the 
rigor of the Turkish prohibitions had been relaxed in their 
favor. Whether under these circumstances they will be 
allowed to repass the Straits without molestation from the 
Turks may be problematical. The note which I received on 
the subject from Count Romanzoff, and of which I trans 
mitted you a copy, shows how favorable the disposition 
of this government is to the extension which our commerce 
would receive by a free admission to that part of the Russian 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 417 

dominions; but the jealousy of the French consul at Odessa 
was roused by the appearance of the American flag, which he 
naturally enough considered as assumed to disguise an Eng 
lish vessel; and since the arrival of several others, bearing 
the same colors, the number of which the rumors of this 
capital have exaggerated to forty, the French Ambassador 
has manifested a similar jealousy to Count RomanzofF. The 
Count who informed me of this last week had not received 
any official intelligence of the arrival of any other vessel than 
the first, which he told me he had assured the Ambassador 
was bonafide and certainly American; having brought a letter 
of recommendation from Mr. Daschkoff himself to the Duke 
de Richelieu, the governor of Odessa. 

The relations between France and Russia, have apparently 
been themselves somewhat affected by the recent changes in 
the state of European affairs; and most especially in con 
sequence of the new alliance between France and Austria, 
formed by the marriage of the Emperor Napoleon with the 
Archduchess Maria Louisa, eldest daughter of the Emperor 
of Austria. In the late war between France and Austria 
Russia was at least in point of form a party as auxiliary to 
France. And in the treaty of peace it was stipulated that a 
territory containing four hundred thousand inhabitants in 
the province of Galicia should be ceded by Austria to Russia. 
Soon after the conclusion of the peace, an Austrian officer of 
rank, Count St. Julien, arrived here, authorised to treat for 
the execution of this stipulation, but without being vested 
with any formal diplomatic character. In arranging the 
convention to carry the cession into effect, a question was 
made by Russia, which arose from a mode of computing 
inhabitants peculiar to this country. By a territory of so 
many inhabitants they understand the number not of souls, 
but of families; and they considered this as the proper con- 



4 i8 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

struction to be given to the stipulation of cession made in 
their favor. As the treaty had been between Austria and 
France, it was agreed to refer for the meaning of this article 
to the opinion of the French government, which was given 
in favor of Austria. In this decision, Russia did not hesitate 
to acquiesce, and the convention has been concluded and 
ratified by both sovereigns accordingly. A circumstance 
which has excited much more the attention of political ob 
servers, because as an omission of formalities it has been 
more generally known, is, that to this day there has been 
no public and formal communication of this marriage, made 
to the Russian government, either by Austria or France. 
The negotiation which terminated in this contract of mar 
riage was not only kept a profound secret to the Russian 
Ambassador at Paris, but he was even led to believe and to 
communicate to his court the belief that the choice of the 
Emperor Napoleon had fixed upon a different person. I am 
told that there has been a confidential communication of the 
marriage, made by the French Ambassador here to the Em 
peror Alexander in person, and this account is in all prob 
ability true; for one of the first noblemen and principal 
ministers of the Empire, Prince Alexis Kurakin, brother of 
the Russian Ambassador at Paris, is appointed Ambassador 
extraordinary to compliment the Emperor Napoleon upon 
this event, and is already gone to execute this mission. But 
symptoms of regret have been suffered to appear in official 
French papers at the sacrifice which Sweden was compelled 
to make of Finland, at the late peace of Fredericshamn, and 
the Emperor of the French has himself declared that he will 
protect the Porte if the Sultan will extricate himself from the 
influence of England. Russia wages at this moment a war of 
oppressive expense, and of equivocal success against the 
Porte. The Emperor Alexander wishes much the termina- 



iSio] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 419 

tion of this war, but considers it indispensable to obtain at 
the peace the entire sovereignty of the provinces of Moldavia 
and Wallachia. The assent of France to this arrangement 
has already been obtained, but there is some reason to be 
lieve that now France will not be displeased, if eventually the 
war should conclude without securing this new accession to 
the Russian dominions. This disposition might acquire new 
strength also, if the Porte, by breaking off all connection 
with England, should lay a claim to the Emperor Napoleon s 
promise of protection. But the point upon which a difference 
between the policy of France and of Russia may be the most 
difficult to conciliate, is that of the commercial intercourse 
with England, which, though severely forbidden by the 
Russian ordinances, was carried on through the course of 
the last year to a great extent. This commerce, altogether 
advantageous to Russia, highly important to her revenues, 
and in the present condition of her finances, perhaps of ab 
solute necessity to preserve her from a formal bankruptcy, is 
however incompatible with the design of the French Em 
peror, to annihilate the commerce of England with the con 
tinent of Europe. The measures which in the pursuit of his 
purpose he has successively imposed upon Denmark, Sweden, 
Austria, Holland, the Rhenish Confederation, and Prussia, 
have already been made known to you. They will all how 
ever prove ineffectual while the intercourse between England 
and Russia can be kept open. The necessity of strong meas 
ures to render the former prohibitions effectual, have been 
and continue to be pressed upon this government by France, 
and have not yet been entirely successful. I wish, though 
without very confidently hoping that the regulations which 
Russia may finally be prevailed upon to adopt, our own com 
merce may be altogether exempted from that proscription, 
which will again be denounced against the commerce of 



420 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

England that commerce which like the hind of Dryden s 
fable has been so often " doomed to death, though fated not 
to die." 

The English government has not neglected the opportunity 
which the declining ardor of the political harmony between 
France and Russia seemed to present, for producing a rup 
ture between them. The English party here have been active 
in such proceedings as the nature of the government would 
admit, and secret propositions have been made from Eng 
land for a separate negotiation with Russia, which have been 
rejected with pointed decision. The ascendancy of France 
at this court will without doubt be more firmly secured by 
the result of her new alliance with Austria, even if it should 
be brought to the test by the requisition of measures the 
most repugnant to the inclinations of the government, as 
well as to the interests of the nation. 

I have the honor, etc. 



TO THOMAS BOYLSTON ADAMS 

ST. PETERSBURG, 21 April, 1810. 

I have hitherto scarcely written you anything upon the 
political affairs of Europe. Events, which in ordinary times 
would be considered as of extraordinary magnitude, succeed 
one another in such rapid succession, that I should hardly 
have had the means of sending away a view of the public 
appearance of Europe, before it would have assumed a new 
one. At the time when I embarked at Charlestown, a war 
almost universal was raging upon this continent. Since then 
the peace of Sweden has been concluded with Russia, with 
Denmark, and with France; that of France and Russia with 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 421 

Austria has been succeeded by the dissolution of marriage 
between the Emperor Napoleon, and his second marriage 
with the eldest daughter of the Emperor of Austria. The 
consequences anticipated from this last event, the most un 
expected of any of those which I have mentioned, are greater 
than from all the others together. It has not only given the 
most cheering hopes to the house of Austria that it will be 
preserved from the downfall of the Bourbons, but the whole 
continent of Europe considers it as a pledge of future peace 
and tranquillity, which may very possibly not be realized. 
Its tendency to consolidate and give stability to the new im 
perial family of France is more obvious and more certain. 
Napoleon is the Croesus of the age, and those who believe 
that the universe is governed by the wisdom and goodness 
of a superior being, can only recur to the caution of Solon, 
and beware of pronouncing upon a man s fortune until they 
have witnessed his end. 

In the meantime everything that occurs in the world seems 
to be fashioned in subserviency to his views. British politi 
cians and their disciples throughout the world have hitherto 
found no other expedient, than to stimulate resistance against 
him where it could not fail to be subdued, and to stigmatize 
the victims which they have successively offered up in sacri 
fice to him. He said, or wrote on a late occasion, that the 
genius of France had directed the British government in 
their expedition to the Scheldt; but a genius favorable to 
him appears to have inspired the British councils from the 
moment when, in the face of their engagements, they set 
him at defiance, to keep possession of the island of Malta. 
To those who feel a real concern for the independence of 
nations and the liberties of mankind, it is truly mortifying 
to observe the little men and the little means, by which the 
great powers and resources of England are wasted in this 



422 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

contest. When we read in ancient history the final struggle 
between Rome and Carthage, we see the triumph of one 
system of political institutions over another, but the great 
est man is on the vanquished side. Now we have a more 
melancholy spectacle, the superior system of political insti 
tutions defeated by the individual imbecility of its sup 
porters. That it may remain no secret to the world, a par 
liamentary inquiry has been many weeks employed to expose 
it in its minutest and most disgusting details. The expedi 
tion to Walcheren is but a single specimen of the manner in 
which the great affairs of the British nation are managed. 
It appears to have been undertaken in the fact of what to 
men of common sense must have been considered a demon 
stration of its impracticability. Its conduct was then 
committed to a man, 1 who would hardly have been fit to 
take possession of the place after its capitulation. Twenty 
thousand men are sent into the midst of a notorious pesti 
lence, and when the physician general of the army is ordered 
to go to their relief, he positively refuses on the avowed 
ground that he knows nothing about contagious distempers. 
When this wise undertaking comes to its natural termina 
tion, the ministers try to throw the blame of the failure upon 
their colleague the general. The general puts it off upon his 
coadjutor the commander of the fleet. 2 One intrigues against 
his associates with the king, another betrays his friend by a 
sham defence of his in Parliament. Ignorance and folly ap 
pear alike conspicuous in all, and those are the antagonists 
who are to maintain the balance of the world against the 
genius and the fortune of Bonaparte. 

The choice of Mr. Jackson, and the manner in which he 
executed his mission in America, furnish another chapter of 

1 John Pitt, second Earl of Chatham (1756-1835). 

2 Sir Richard John Strachan (1760-1828). 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 423 

the same history perfectly corresponding with it in its char 
acteristic features. Fortunately both for England and for 
us, when Mr. Jackson s hard studied vivacities and their 
effects come back to Europe, the facetious and spirited 
gentleman, 1 who had sent him out to repair the cracks and 
flaws of his master s dignity, was laid up with a lame leg, 
caught in the attempt to trip up the heels of a ministerial 
colleague, 2 and was engaging the leisure of a temporary re 
tirement from the Cabinet. 

His successor, 3 of whose personal character I have little 
knowledge, appears at least to be gifted with a little more dis 
cretion, and has not undertaken to bear out Mr. Jackson in 
his lofty pretensions and fiery temper. What the actual 
state of our affairs with England is I am not authentically 
informed, but the rumors of the Gazette announce that a 
new convention has been signed by Mr. Pinkney and the 
Marquis Wellesley, to take effect in case it should be ratified 
by the American government. 

It is much to be wished that this may be true. If it should 
prove so, and our commercial and amicable intercourse with 
England should be restored, I am persuaded that France and 
her dependents will follow the example. At present they 
are heaping outrage upon outrage in their treatment of us. 
If our merchants have not been allowed to arm their vessels, 
nine-tenths of those which may hazard a European voyage 
will meet no other reception than seizure and confiscation. 
But if we could once make an arrangement with England 
consistent with our right and our honor, our commerce is 
competent to defend itself against all other force that it

would meet upon the ocean, and to teach once more a lesson 
of forbearance and moderation to France and all her de 
pendants. Would I might see that day! 

Remember me duly to all our dear friends around you. 
We enjoy as good health as this excessively severe climate 
can be expected to admit. I have received the Patriot down 
only to the 4th of November, and read its columns with 
great interest and pleasure. The letter to Congress in 1781 
about the invasion of Zealand by the English was a prophecy 
just now fulfilled. 1 Ever affectionately yours. 

TO JOHN ADAMS 

ST. PETERSBURG, 30 April, 1810. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

The reception which my family and myself have met here 
has been everything that we could desire. The disposition 
of the Emperor towards the United States was manifested 
in the strongest and most friendly terms by him at my first 
audience, and has been frequently repeated by his principal 
minister, the Chancellor, Count Romanzoff, from that time 
to the present. The personal attentions which we have re 
ceived have been so numerous, that with my habits and 
feelings, the only cause of complaint has been the mode of 
life in which they have necessarily involved us, a mode of life, 
for which neither the taste nor the constitutions of most of 
us were suited. At the hazard of giving offence by denying 
a great proportion of the hospitable civilities crowded upon 
us, I have extricated myself from a course of dissipation in 
which we should otherwise have been inevitably involved, 

1 The letter is dated January i, 1781, and is in the Boston Patriot, November 4, 
1809, but is not in the Works of John Adams. 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 425 

and which is as incompatible with the habits of industry to 
which I have been used, as with those of economy, which my 
situation so imperiously imposes upon us. 

Of the continuance of these amicable dispositions towards 
my country I still receive frequent marks by communica 
tions from the Chancellor, nor have I any reason to appre 
hend any unfavorable change, as long as this government 
shall follow the impulsion of its principles and interests. 
The Emperor and his ministers are thoroughly convinced 
that all the relations existing between the United States and 
this country are beneficial to Russia; that they are already 
important, and susceptible of being made much more so. 
But how far these sentiments may be found to yield occa 
sionally to a French or English influence, is beyond my power 
of anticipation to say. They arose and acquired their 
strength in opposition to an English influence, which for 
many years predominated at this court with irresistible 
power. It is now not at all favored by a French influence, 
almost as overruling, an influence, which instead of being 
impaired by the new alliance of France with Austria, will ac 
quire additional vigor from it. 

The marriage of the French Emperor with the Austrian 
Archduchess is an event which has occasioned great joy 
throughout the continent of Europe. The people, who every 
where were shuddering with the anticipation of the rivers of 
their blood which might yet flow to swell the great deep of the 
conqueror Napoleon s triumphs, now flatter themselves that 
this ocean will crave no more supplies. It must be the fer 
vent prayer of humanity that this hope may be realized. 
But the bond of marriage is a feeble tie in the way of ambi 
tion, and if it had ever proved strong, Napoleon has already 
shown the world what account he makes of it. The tend 
ency of this transaction to establish and consolidate his 



4 26 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

power is to my mind more obvious, or rather more certain, 
than of its securing tranquillity to the world. This idea has 
been expressed more ingeniously in the motto of an illumina 
tion at Amsterdam than I have seen it anywhere else. 
"Pax Thalami, Pax Orbis erit." But in this promise I am 
afraid the remaining subjects of the king of Holland will find 
themselves as much disappointed, as in their project of pre 
serving their national independence by accepting a brother 
of the great Napoleon for their king. The nuptial torch is 
not formed to extinguish the fires of conquest. For my own 
part I perceive no refuge from the past, present and future 
miseries of mankind, but in the doctrine of the optimist: 

If storms and earthquakes break not Heaven s design, 
Why then a Borgia or a Cataline? 

One of the greatest admirers of this extraordinary per 
sonage, not long since expressed to me a serious apprehension 
that he would some day lay claim to worship from mankind, 
as a being of a superior species. Observing that I smiled at 
his alarm, he assured me from his own personal knowledge of 
the man that he does entertain this idea of himself, and has 
repeatedly manifested a propensity to give it out to the 
world. He has, indeed, the example of Alexander, and still 
more that of Mahomet, before him; and notwithstanding we 
live in an age so enlightened, I am not sure that if he chose to 
proclaim himself a deity, like Alexander, or a prophet, like 
Mahomet, he would not have eight hundred thousand sol 
diers ready to propagate his faith at the point of the bayonet 
throughout the habitable world. I can only hope that 
among the mysterious dispensations of providence is not in 
cluded that of permitting a fifth part of the human race to 
prostrate themselves in adoration before the god Bonaparte. 
The transition from infidelity to fanaticism is as easy and as 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 427 

natural as that from unbounded democracy to despotism, a 
transition of which France is exhibiting so glorious a demon 
stration. I believe nobody will now deny, that the time has 
come which you foretold, when nobody would believe you, 
that the very name of republicanism is more detested in 
France than that of monarchy ever was at the moment of 
its destruction. This hatred of republics is not without its 
influence in producing the treatment which we experience 
from France, which will continue as long as we suffer the 
same sort of treatment from England, if not as long as our 
merchants continue to furnish gratuitously temptation and 
gratification to the spirit of plunder. I am, etc. 



TO JOSEPH PITCAIRN 

ST. PETERSBURG, 8 May, 1810. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

I received by the last mail your favor of 21 April, which 
contains much interesting information, for which I give you 
my thanks. I had also duly received your letters of 26 Jan 
uary and 9 February, to which I have not hitherto replied, 
partly owing to an indisposition which confined me for some 
weeks, and partly from a dearth of any information to re 
turn, which could be interesting to you. 

I shall take such steps with respect to the subjects men 
tioned in your last, as may be answerable to your intentions 
as well with regard to the Prussian government as concern 
ing your own affair. The conduct of France towards the 
United States has been, and continues to be, such that I 
have not thought it advisable very assiduously to cultivate 
the acquaintance of the French Ambassador here. On one 
occasion, an important one, I endeavored to engage his in- 



428 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

fluence with his government to change, or at least to mod 
erate, a course of proceeding towards us equally unjust and 
impolitic. I found his own dispositions favorable, and I 
have no reason to believe them altered; but his influence 
with his government is itself perhaps not very great, unless 
upon subjects within the province of his office, and he was 
not willing to make himself responsible for anything which 
might seem to counteract its general policy. Under these 
circumstances it will, perhaps, be some time before I can 
have an opportunity to speak to him upon your business in 
a manner which may be of any service to you, but if the oc 
casion should present itself, you may rely upon everything 
on my part which a sense of justice, as well as of an unabated 
and ardent desire to serve you, can suggest. 

The political and commercial relations between France 
and the United States are doubtless in a very unfavorable 
and unpromising condition. The measures of France, I be 
lieve, will rather irritate than terrify our countrymen, and 
fifty per cent 1 may be still a fortunate rate of ransom for the 
individuals who can extricate themselves by that sacrifice. 
The tenth article of the late treaty between France and 
Holland speaks as unequivocally the disposition of France 
towards the United States, as the condemnations in France, 
Spain, Naples and Trieste, on the allegation that French 
vessels are so treated in the United States. 

It gives me pleasure to learn that the property which had 
been sequestered in Holstein has been principally restored. 
The new Danish ordinance for the regulation of privateers 
gives me some uneasiness, though it is represented as a 
moderating qualification of the former law. 

The dispositions of the government here continue to be 

1 Levying a duty of fifty per cent ad valorem on colonial produce actually in 
Holland. 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 429 

favorable and friendly towards the United States. A great 
number of arrivals from America is expected as soon as the 
navigation shall be open. The Neva remains yet frozen 
over, which so late in the season is almost unexampled. It 
cannot, however, last many days longer. I am, etc. 



TO WILLIAM EUSTIS 

ST. PETERSBURG, 10 May, 1810. 

MY DEAR SIR: 

I send you together with this letter some additional in 
formation respecting the cultivation of hemp in this country, 
together with a long extract from a French treatise on the 
same subject, furnished me by a friend here in answer to 
the questions of General Hampton. It appears that there 
are no machines in use for the preparation of this plant in 
Russia, other than those which are well known throughout 
the United States, and which are applied to flax as much as 
to hemp. 

I write you now in daily expectation that the breaking up 
of the river Neva will restore the possibility of navigation 
between this country and ours. Twelve or thirteen other 
American vessels, besides that in which I came from America, 
have been detained here through the long period of a Russian 
winter, unusually protracted to this time, and wait only for 
the moving of the waters to take their departure. I wish 
they may all arrive safe at the places of their destination, 
but they are all exposed to the danger at least of Danish 
privateers. The proceedings of Denmark during the last 
year in relation to the commerce of the United States must 
be well known to you. The depredations of their privateers 
were so excessive, that before the close of the last summer a 



430 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

royal order was issued revoking all their commissions. A 
new ordinance has, however, just been promulgated con 
taining a new set of regulations, or rather some slight modifi 
cations under which they were authorized heretofore, but 
the effect of which beyond all doubt will be the capture and 
condemnation of a great additional mass of American prop 
erty. 

Besides the individual American sufferers, who have been 
involuntarily detained to claim the justice of the Danish gov 
ernment upon their own cases, Mr. George Joy and Mr. 
Forbes have spent the winter at Copenhagen, endeavoring 
to give something like official weight to their representations. 
The consul of the United States there, Mr. Saabye, being 
himself a Danish subject, partner of a commercial house 
which probably transacts business for the government, has 
been thought by most of our unfortunate countrymen who 
needed the benefit of his interposition, not so warm in his 
zeal or so active in his exertions for them as the duties of his 
office required. But it is very much to be doubted whether 
any merely pacific representations would suffice, to over 
power the impulses under which the Danish depredations 
upon our commerce have been committed. 

Denmark has suffered extremely by the war in which she 
was so suddenly and unexpectedly involved. Her commerce 
has been almost annihilated. The most profitable source of 
her revenues has been nearly drained, and she has been com 
pelled to maintain an army far more numerous than her 
population can bear, but which so long as the island of Zea 
land is not invaded, is a burden as useless as it is oppressive. 

A small English squadron has been stationed at the pas 
sage of the Sound, which has suffered scarcely any neutral 
vessels to go through there. The navigation and commerce 
of the Baltic have been thus forced through the channel of 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 431 

the Belt, and Denmark has lost the duties which for many 
ages she has been accustomed to levy upon the passage of 
the Sound. Most of the American vessels which have come 
into the Baltic during the last season have passed through 
the Belt, either by their own preference to save the Sound 
duties, or to take the benefit of the English convoys, which 
has always very readily been allowed, or finally, because 
upon presenting themselves at the entrance of the Sound, 
they have been stopped by the blockading squadron, and 
had no choice left but to come through the Belt or abandon 
the voyage. In passing by the Belt, and even in taking 
English convoy, the Americans have had no idea of violating 
the laws of neutrality, but the Danes entertain a different 
opinion. This circumstance has exasperated them not only 
against the individual transgressors, but has stimulated 
them to animosity against our nation itself. Many Ameri 
cans have navigated under British licenses. Several British 
vessels have been detected in attempts to trade under 
American colors with forged papers. Almost all the cor 
responding merchants and consignees of Americans in Den 
mark, and generally in the north of Europe, are English 
houses, or houses in time of peace engaged in extensive trade 
with England. Add to all this the temptation afforded by 
the richness of the spoil, and the security felt from the pre 
vailing opinion, that it is utterly defenceless, together with 
the sharp and incessant instigations of France, and you may 
conclude what prospects await most of the American vessels 
which will swarm to the Baltic the ensuing summer. 

Among the slight and mutilated accounts which come to 
us from America through the medium of French, English and 
German newspapers we have heard of a bill or resolution 
proposed in Congress by Mr. Burwell, for authorizing con 
voys for our vessels, and also for permitting them to be 



432 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

armed and to defend themselves against privateers. 1 I am 
persuaded that some provision of this kind would be attended 
by the best consequences. There are very few, if any, Eng 
lish privateers out, and as the measure does not propose 
resistance against national ships of the belligerents, it would 
not probably produce any additional collision with England. 
There would doubtless be occasional captures by French 
privateers, but not so many as there are in the present state 
of things, and they would probably not fare worse. But 
against the Danish privateering system it would give a 
defense altogether adequate to the need. The numbers and 
the force of the British armed vessels on all the Danish coasts 
are such, that no Danish privateer of any considerable force 
can be fitted out and keep the sea. The privateers which 
molested our navigation so much last summer, and those 
which I fear will prove most pernicious in the next, are mere 
sail boats, often without a deck or even a cannon, which sally 
from the harbors just as our vessels are passing before them, 
and take them only because the authority to resist is not 
allowed to the American. 

There have been serious and repeated propositions made 
by France to England for opening a negotiation for a general 
peace. The Austrian Prime Minister, Count Metternich, 2 
has been some time at Paris, and through him I understand 
the mediation of Austria has been formally renewed to the 
British government. There appears, however, a great aver 
sion to peace in England, and this aversion is not confined to 
the ministerial party. They do not yet consider the cause of 
Ferdinand VII in Spain as so desperate, that they would be 
justified in abandoning their recent treaties in his favor. 
The account of affairs in Spain will reach you as soon and

as near the truth as they come here. The European con 
tinent and the British islands exhibit newspapers corre 
sponding to those of our parties in America. The gazettes 
of this continent, without exception, are little else than 
extracts from the Moniteur and the Journal de F Empire. 
They say precisely everything which the French government 
intends should be said, and nothing more. The English 
papers with some variety and much opposition between 
themselves, owing to a remnant of liberty left to their press, 
say little or nothing of foreign affairs but what their govern 
ment chooses should be said. Almost all their news from the 
continent is false. The French practice of suppressing every 
thing which happens unfavorable to them produces, however, 
numerous reports of such events, which circulate in whispers, 
and which are often unfounded or exaggerated. It is now 
currently reported here that they have been defeated in 
Spain, on the frontiers of Portugal, and that they will be 
obliged to raise the siege of Cadiz. If there is any material 
foundation for these rumors, the reluctance of the British to 
a negotiation for peace will be stronger than ever. I am, etc. 



TO GEORGE JOY 

ST. PETERSBURG, n May, 1810. 

SIR: 

I have successively received your favors of 16 March, 10, 
14 and 17 April, with the original and English translation of 
the late Danish ordinance for the regulation of privateers. 
Your letter of April 14 came to hand not until yesterday, 
though that of the lyth, with the translation of the instruc 
tions, had been received by the preceding post. I answer all 
these letters at once, not because the contents of each of 



434 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

them did not require from their interesting character a sep 
arate answer, but because, understanding that the clerks of 
the post office at Copenhagen are admitted as third parties 
to the confidence of all private correspondence which passes 
through their hands, I have not been willing to add to the 
severity of their duty the trouble of perusing letters, which 
would afford them so little amusement as those which I 
might have written you. 

That the king of Denmark, his ministers and his people 
should be extremely exasperated against England, is not 
only natural but perfectly just. Among the examples of 
political profligacy and wanton outrage which the European 
nations for the last half century have rendered so familiar, 
the British attack upon Copenhagen, as far as I have been 
able to estimate its merits, stands at the very pinnacle of 
infamy. From the little opportunity which I had during 
the last autumn to witness the feelings of his Danish maj 
esty s subjects in Norway, and even in the island of Soelland 
[Zealand], if anything struck me with peculiar force, it was 
the little sensibility manifested upon that atrocious act. For 
however the Russian government may be suspected of 
connivance at the trade carried on to so great an extent be 
tween this country and England, they could at least retort, 
that the Danish dominions have to their full proportion 
participated in the same trade. 

It appears to me also that proof more unequivocal might 
be given of a sincere and just resentment against England, 
than by measures specially and avowedly pointed against 
Russia and the United States. 

Whether the new instructions have in their original lan 
guage more precision than their predecessors, I am not 
qualified to judge. In the translation which you have been 
kind enough to present me I find anything but precision. 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 435 

The renewal of privateering under any instructions speaks a 
language too intelligible to us Americans, who know that the 
really British trade is too well protected to fall within the 
grasp of Danish privateers. 

It is a circumstance which gave me not less surprise than 
pain to learn that Count Bernstorff so positively assured 
you, not only before the ordinance issued, that taking Brit 
ish convoy would be cause for suspicion and not for con 
demnation, but even after it was public, that such was the 
regulation. It justifies if not requires inferences which I am 
not unwilling to make. As to the principle itself, I believe 
it to be entirely new and not justifiable upon the application 
of any ancient principle of national law. Equitably con 
sidered, no doubt taking hostile convoy affords ground of 
suspicion, but it neither makes the ship enemy s property, 
nor loads it with contraband. It is, therefore, virtually an 
inconsistency to say in one section, that a friend s ship shall 
protect the cargo of an enemy, and in another than an 
enemy s convoy shall be cause for confiscating a friend s 
ship. 

With respect to the remainder of this ordinance the fol 
lowing observations have occurred to me. I. The bonds re 
quired to be given by the owners of privateers are so trifling 
that, as a security against misconduct, they might as well give 
none; 1000 rix-dollars are not more than equivalent ,to 300 
dollars American currency; 15,000 rix-dollars is the maximum 
to be required. If that had been prescribed on the con 
trary as the lowest sum, it would scarcely have been ade 
quate. If the translation is correct, the owners of the pri 
vateers are not even responsible in their property (excepting 
the privateer itself) for damage done to the captured ship. 

2. Among the papers enumerated as necessary for the 
neutral vessel are two at least, which are not customary on 



436 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

board American vessels, and which many of them will not 
possess, viz. a bill of gauge (distinct from the certificate con 
tained in the register), and a receipt for having paid the cus 
tom or duty. The former Danish privateering laws required 
a bill of measurement, but as that is always included in our 
registers the courts must have taken that as sufficient. The 
new ordinance requires it as a separate paper, and that it 
should agree with the measurement in the register. In the 
former law the custom house clearance was required; but 
how can a receipt for the payment of duties be exhibited 
when no duties have been paid? Our constitutional laws 
do not allow duties to be levied upon exportation. The 
ship s journal is also a document which was not required by 
the former law. Possibly the difference in the two other 
cases is in the translation, and not in the original language. 
It is not to be presumed that the Danish government in 
tended to prescribe papers which they know our ships do not 
possess, and to authorize the capture of all vessels not pos 
sessing them. Especially when neither of the papers can 
be material to the neutrality. 

3. In 14, the privateer is authorized to compel the com 
mander of the neutral vessel to come on board of him with 
the ship s documents. This is also in the former ordinance, 
but is it consistent with the law of nations or with equity? 
The right of the belligerents, and no nation knows this better 
than the Danes, is merely a right to search the neutral. He 
has no right to order the captain of the neutral out of his 
ship, nor to separate the ship from her papers. Both these 
things are extremely inconvenient and dangerous to the 
neutral. If I am not misinformed, there is even now at 
Copenhagen an American vessel of unquestionable neutral 
ity, condemned in the first instance and in danger of being 
so upon the appeal, because in the most imminent peril of 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 437 

shipwreck her papers were transported into another vessel, 
and could not afterwards be recovered. 

4. By 23, the neutral vessel carried into port is liable, 
even upon the first examination of the magistrate, to be un 
loaded, if the privateer insists upon it. This is not in the 
former ordinance, and you can judge to what excessive 
abuses such a license is liable by privateersmen, who may 
be under 1000 rix-dollar bonds, and not worth another 
thousand in the world. 

I know not whether you will have any opportunity to urge 
these objections in a manner which can have any influence 
in producing their removal. The deepest injury we have 
heretofore suffered, as you remark, has not been owing to the 
law, but to the constant violation of every law by the pri 
vateers to the extraordinary proceedings of the courts, 
and to the utter impunity of the privateersmen, even of 
those whose outrages were most destitute of every shadow of 
pretence. 

What Count BernstorfFs information may be, which leads 
him to believe that we are upon the eve of an adjustment 
with England, is not for me to say; that such an adjustment 
will take place appears to me very probable, but I neither 
believe nor fear that it will be followed by any additional 
hostilities of France towards us. France and her allies, 
Denmark included, have been laboring to the utmost of , their 
power to reconcile us with England. For this we owe them 
no obligations. Their services are like that of the man, who 
in aiming a dagger at the heart of his friend, opened an ab 
scess, and saved his life. If England has the sense to offer 
us terms which it is possible to accept with honor, France 
and Denmark too will follow the example. For speaking of 
France and her allies, I must in common candor make an 
exception in favor of Russia. With resentments if not quite 



438 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

so deep, certainly as just and as sincere as those of Denmark 
against England, the Emperor of Russia hitherto has distin 
guished the difference between English and Americans, be 
tween inveterate enemies and valuable friends, between war 
against maritime usurpation and the plunder of lawful 
neutrality. 

The Emperor Napoleon has, indeed, shown not a little 
address, in bringing so much of his cause at the present period 
of his English war upon the British Orders of Council of 
November, 1807. On this point the British are as unable to 
answer his argument, as they are to shake the crown upon 
his head by their arms. They have put themselves in the 
wrong, and he is contriving that they shall not have the 
merit of treading back their steps without humiliation. 
Your observations on the use which may have been made in 
negotiation of this French manoeuvre, are ingenious, but 
I think the calculation of Napoleon, or rather of him whose 
hand is visible in this policy, was directly the contrary. He 
was afraid, as you think, that England would yield the 
point to us, and started our claim as his own, to kindle Brit 
ish pride in support of British obstinacy against yielding the 
point at all. He knew that whenever peace should be on the 
carpet, this could not in the nature of things make any ques 
tion between him and England. But he knew that if England 
gave up this, she would instantly have all our trade again, 
and take from him his pretext for plundering us. He under 
stands the English character well. I hope you in this in 
stance have understood it still better. I am, etc. 



JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 439 

TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
No. 15. [ROBERT SMITH] 

ST. PETERSBURG, 19 May, 1810. 
SIR: 

I know not upon what recognized principle of the laws of 
nations, Denmark can justify the condemnation of neutral 
vessels merely for having occasionally joined a British con 
voy. The only principle which can give color to such a doc 
trine is the British fiction that by enjoying a privilege granted 
by an enemy which is not allowed in time of peace, neutral 
property is transmuted into the property of the enemy. It 
is however not to be denied that a belligerent convoy is not 
altogether compatible with the privileges and obligations of 
neutrality, and it is to be regretted that any of our own ves 
sels have found themselves under the necessity of taking it. 
So far as respects the Danes, if one or two of our own frigates 
were stationed in the North Sea and in the Baltic, near the 
entrance of the passage on both sides of the Belt, they would 
be adequate to protect all our merchant vessels against 
Danish privateers. This measure I am persuaded would be 
attended with happy effects, not only by protecting much 
property which will otherwise be lost, but by impressing the 
Danish government itself with the idea, that the United 
States are not without means of defending their commerce. 
The spirit of rapine, of which England and France are ex 
hibiting such extraordinary examples, is infectious. Den 
mark is suffering beyond the bounds of endurance by the 
war, into which she was so wantonly plunged by the aggres 
sion of England; her active and profitable commerce is 



440 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

annihilated; her fleet in possession of the British; her rev 
enues decayed; her finances in ruin, compelled to maintain 
an army, six times greater than her population can bear, and 
cut off even by the control of France, from the advantages 
which American merchants were pouring into her lap. In this 
state of national wretchedness, and of famine, her people see 
from their shores our ships richly laden sometimes passing 
under the protection of her enemy, and in their views of 
things defrauding her of her lawful toll duties; and sometimes 
without any protection at all, presenting a prey equally 
tempting and easy to the grasp of plunder. Heroic virtue 
is not the fashion of the age. The excitement is too strong 
to be resisted. It becomes essential to counteract it by ex 
citing sentiments of a different description, and none can 
be so efficacious, as the assurance that the property will be 
defended. 

In the midst of the extreme rigor with which France is 
interdicting to her allies all commerce with England, it is 
said from sources which I believe to be correct, that the direct 
trade between France herself and England by licenses has 
become very extensive. The French government grant li 
censes to all vessels which carry grain, to bring back any 
cargo, at their owners option, and on the vessel s return, no 
questions are asked from whence she came, but a tribute of 
thirty per cent on the value of the cargoes is levied by the 
government upon this trade. And this is what they call the 
continental system. The crime of Holland, for which a fifth 
part of her small population and territory has been taken 
from her, was trading secretly with England. The Emperor 
Napoleon uses no such secrecy; he licenses vessels to trade 
with his own signature, and, ridiculous as it may appear, 
there has been a report in circulation, to which these circum 
stances have given some countenance, that France and 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 441 

England are about to make a treaty of commerce together, 
without making peace. 

The ice of the river Neva has at length broken up, after 
remaining later in the season than has been known since the 
foundation of the city. It has not yet disappeared from the 
Gulf of Finland, even between this place and Cronstadt. 
Upwards of twenty American vessels, bound to various 
ports on the Baltic have already passed the Sound, and I 
have heard already of two carried in by Danish privateers 
under the new ordinance. I have received several applica 
tions from persons desirous of being appointed consuls for 
the United States in Prussian ports, some of which* are open 
for American vessels. There would be an advantage at the 
present times if we had faithful, and active consuls at Memel, 
at Konigsberg, and at Stettin. I say faithful, because they 
would otherwise carry on English trade, for English houses, 
and connive at or support the London manufacture of 
American papers; and I say active, because while France 
pursues her continental system, in her present manner, 
and Prussia is at the mercy of France, seizures like those in 
Schleswig and Holstein, or articles in treaties like the tenth 
of that between France and Holland, could not be prevented, 
and might occur from one day to another. The consul 
should have the talent of discerning the symptoms which in 
dicate the approach of such measures, and if duly active 
might in a great degree succeed in neutralizing their effects. 

I have the honor, etc. 



442 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 

No. 16. [ROBERT SMITH] 

ST. PETERSBURG, 25 May, 1810. 
SIR: 

Mr. Heard l of Boston arrived here a few days since, hav 
ing travelled over land from Constantinople. He has given 
me some further information respecting the American vessels 
which had been admitted there. They were only two; one 
of which was the brig from Baltimore, which proceeded to 
Odessa, and the other still remains at Constantinople. Mr. 
Heard informs me that a representation from the Americans, 
as well at Constantinople as at Smyrna, has been forwarded 
to the President of the United States, setting forth the public 
advantage which might be derived from a treaty of commerce 
with the Ottoman Porte, and the inconveniences and vexa 
tions suffered by the Americans, who without the protection 
of such a treaty have obtained access into the Sultan s 
dominions. Undoubtedly the free admission to the naviga 
tion of the Black Sea would open a new source of prosperity 
to the industry and enterprise of our country. I have al 
ready had the honor to inform you of the favorable light 
in which this object is considered here, and I now enclose an 
article extracted from the gazette of this city, which was 
certainly not inserted without the approbation of the gov 
ernment, and which contains another manifestation of the 
same sentiments, which have been officially expressed by 
the Chancellor, Count Romanzoff. At present, the Amer 
icans who reach Constantinople, or even Smyrna, are obliged 
to put themselves under the protection of some European 

i John R. Kurd. 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 443 

government, and to assume their flag. The usual circum 
stances, which in all foreign countries assimilate our people 
to the English, have in general induced them to seek the 
protection of that flag, when they could obtain it, and it 
has not been gratuitously or very liberally bestowed. Mr. 
Heard says that the good offices of the Swedish charge des 
affaires finally obtained the admission of the two American 
vessels, and that no small part of the opposition which they 
had previously met proceeded from the English minister. 
There is a greater disposition of indulgence and amity at 
Constantinople towards Sweden, than perhaps towards any 
other European nation. The origin of which may be traced 
to a common fear of Russia. The Swedish treaty with the 
Porte is said to secure to the subjects of that kingdom ex 
traordinary privileges, and is recommended as a model for 
that which is desired to be obtained for the United States. 
Mr. Palin, the Swedish charge des affaires, gave Mr. Heard a 
letter for Count Stedingk, the ambassador of his nation at 
this court; in which he mentions what he had done in favor 
of these Americans, and that he had given notice of it to the 
king of Sweden, and requested his permission to extend the 
same good offices further, until the United States should 
have a treaty with the Porte. With respect to this last ob 
ject he adds, that its success will in a great measure depend 
upon the observance of secrecy, alluding I presume to the 
opposition which I have already mentioned, and perhaps to 
that of other Europeans besides the English. For at Con 
stantinople, as in the states of Barbary, as the admission of 
any Christian nation to commercial access is in the nature 
of an exclusive privilege, they who already possess it con 
sider it as a general principle of policy, as far as they are able, 
to prevent the admission of a new comer, to participate in 
the benefit. With regard to France also, at the present 



444 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

juncture we must expect all the ill offices that her public 
agents can employ against us as well in Turkey, as else 
where. 

In other respects perhaps no opportunity could be more 
promising than the present, for obtaining a favorable treaty 
with the Porte. The influence of France and of England is, 
as far as I can learn, equally weak there. The Turks have 
received so many and so great outrages from both the par 
ties that they are equally exasperated against both. The 
English minister has been for several months on the point of 
quitting the capital, and his departure has been only delayed 
by the refusal of the Sultan, to permit the frigate, which was 
to take Mr. Adair away, to pass up to the city. At the same 
time, actual hostilities have taken place between the Turkish 
and French troops, on the frontiers of the territories ceded 
by Austria, in the late treaty of peace. 

There have been some popular disturbances at Con 
stantinople, and a great fire, which destroyed a great part of 
the suburb of Pera Mr. Heard says, six thousand houses. 
This too is considered as an indication of discontent among 
the people. But it appears that a supply of grain has been 
obtained from Egypt, and the scarcity to which the commo 
tions were attributed has been at least in part removed. The 
vessels which had been chartered to fetch grain from Odessa 
were not allowed to take it, the very scarcity which they 
were intended to remedy having occasioned a prohibition 
of exportation by the Duke de Richelieu, the governor of the 
Russian provinces in that neighborhood. The want of 
exportation, however, was felt at Odessa as severely as the 
want of importation at Constantinople, and I have some 
reason to believe, that the government here and the Duke de 
Richelieu himself now regret that the opportunity of so 
profitable a trade has been lost. The example of France, 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 445 

where in the midst of all the rigor of the continental sys 
tem licenses for the exportation of grain to England have not 
only been freely granted, but promoted by permissions im 
plied if not expressed to bring back English manufactures, 
or any thing else in return, has strongly recommended a 
similar relaxation here, and if the scarcity at Constantinople 
should continue, or again occur, I think the prohibition of 
exportation on the Russian part, will not remain. 

The hopes of peace between Russia and the Porte, are as 
unpromising as of that between France and England. The 
late commander in chief of the Russian army against the 
Turks, Prince Bagration, 1 since his removal has not returned 
to St. Petersburg. His successor, General Kamensky 2 has 
again crossed the Danube, and resumed offensive operations, 
but whether he will be able to maintain them, is much 
doubted by the military men here, who know the difficulties 
of the country which is the scene of the war, and the condi 
tion of his army suffering, it is said, severely by disease. 

The occasion upon which the recent hostilities between 
the Turkish and French troops on the borders of Croatia, 
was a question relative to boundaries. By treaties between 
Turkey and Austria previous to the late war of the latter 
with France, the Porte had stipulated to cede to Austria 
certain fortresses and districts of territory bounding on the 
province of Croatia. The influence of France, however, had 
prevented the delivery of these places into the actual posses 
sion of the Austrians, these provinces having been included 
in the cessions from Austria to France, by the late treaty of 
peace. The French troops have been ordered to take pos 
session of these places, which though ceded had never been 
delivered to the Austrians. The Turks, were as unwilling 

1 Peter Ivanovltch, Prince Bagration (1762-1812). 

2 Nikolai Kamenskoi. 



446 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

to yield them to France as to Austria, and made resistance. 
There is an opinion entertained by some persons of good 
information, that a concert will be formed between France, 
Austria, and Russia, under which the Ottoman Empire will 
entirely sink. I do not think this probable, from the present 
symptoms in the political relations of these powers. There 
is yet a manifest coolness between the cabinets of St. Peters 
burg and Vienna; nor can it be doubted, however it may be 
denied, that in the present honeymoon of the new alliance 
between France and Austria, the more ancient but less in 
timate ties between France and Russia have experienced 
some relaxation. 

By the last accounts from Copenhagen, I learn, that two 
American vessels, after having passed at Elsineur, and paid 
the Sound duties have been taken by Danish privateers and 
carried into Copenhagen. An order from that government 
has also been issued prohibiting the publication of the 
Sound lists, as has always been customary. The object of 
this last measure is not apparent. Several English ships of 
war have already passed through the Belt into the Baltic, 
where it is reported that a fleet of twenty sail of the line 
are to be sent. From this force a new expedition against the 
island of Zealand has been inferred as probable. If really 
intended, you will hear of it more directly from another 
quarter. 

I remain, etc. 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 447 

TO ABIGAIL ADAMS 

ST. PETERSBURG, 6 June, 1810. 
MY DEAR MOTHER: 

Captain Thomas of the Express, a vessel belonging to Mr. 
W. R. Gray, arrived here a few days ago, and brought me 
your kind favor of 31 December and 12 January. It was 
the second letter from you that I have had the pleasure of 
receiving, and after several months of expectation gave me 
new reason for rejoicing at the final release of these regions 
from the chains of winter. 

The ship Horace, Captain Bickford, to which and to whom 
we are indebted for bringing us safely hither, after having 
been locked up nearly eight months by the ice, is now about 
to sail upon her return home. Her voyage hitherto has been 
upon the whole highly prosperous, though, as you have 
learnt from my letters to my brother, not without imminent 
perils, which with the blessing of providence we escaped, and 
though during the winter the captain has had the misfortune 
to lose three of his men by the smallpox. How she will 
accomplish her return voyage is yet in the bosom of futurity. 
She has all my good wishes and prayers for her safety. . . . 

The failure of Mr. Jackson s mission was naturally to be 
expected, as well from the transactions between the Ameri 
can and British governments which had immediately, pre 
ceded it, as from the known character of the negotiator. 
What have been the proceedings of the British cabinet to 
wards America since they have been informed of that event, 
I do not know. The king s speech to Parliament professed a 
pacific disposition towards the United States, but there has 
been no relaxation of the British maritime system, as it was 
modified by the Orders in Council of April, 1809, and it is 
said that Mr. Jackson has not been recalled. 



44 8 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

The Marquis Wellesley, who is now the English Minister 
of Foreign Affairs, appears in his political system not to 
differ much from Mr. Canning. Neither of them has dis 
covered the disposition upon which alone any peace is to be 
expected in Europe, or upon the ocean. France, on the 
other hand, and all the states directly under her influence 
and control, have been heaping the measure of outrage and 
injury to our commerce. They have not only condemned 
and confiscated our vessels and their cargoes in France, in 
Spain, and in Naples, but they have formally stipulated by 
treaty, that the American property imported into Holland 
since the first of January, 1809, shall be placed at the disposi 
tion of the French Emperor, according to the relations be 
tween France and the United States. France, too, has 
adopted the English practice of giving licenses, and levying 
upon them an enormous tax. In this substitute for neutral 
trade both these nations, or rather their governments, find 
their account so well, that I see no prospect of any tolerated 
neutrality during the remainder of the present war between 
France and England. 

I have been much amused by your extract from the 
learned labors of the Analyser, 1 with his palpitations of heart 
at the thoughts of the Russian mission. This same suspicion, 
which Mr. Pickering s political ethics have turned from a 
vice into a virtue, plays its votaries as wild tricks as any 
other heathen idol ever practised. It is not only perpetually 
leading them to false conclusions, but it mocks them with an 
image of their own profound sagacity. They hug themselves 
for their discoveries, and attribute to the superior keenness of

insincerity of the cabinet for peace, and as unnecessary.

their own eyes the privilege of seeing what nobody else can 
perceive, when the real reason is, because there is nothing to 
be seen. 

By the English newspapers, which from time to time I have 
the opportunity of seeing here, we have intelligence from 
America much later than we can receive it directly. They 
are particularly assiduous in disseminating everything which 
had a tendency to injure and discredit us in the opinions of 
the European nations. The resolutions of the Massachusetts 
legislature on the subject of the negotiation of Jackson have 
had their effect in an eminent degree. The conclusion drawn 
from them on this continent is, that the Americans are on the 
point of a civil war between the partisans of France and of 
England. In France the Emperor Napoleon, who upon 
newspaper publications and pamphlet satire upon himself is 
irritable to an extreme, has been exasperated against Amer 
ica, more by the ribaldry upon himself with which our presses 
and legislative debates have teemed, than by any measures 
of our government. In England, where the contempt which 
almost all parties affect for us is merely a disguise for envy, 
malevolence, and fear, they recur to those Massachusetts and 
New York resolutions, as proofs of our national impotence, 
and at the same time to our government s partiality to 
France and against them. Both parties are encouraged and 
confirmed in the policy of oppressing a nation so debilitated 
by internal dissensions, and the result is, that we are made 
the common football of Europe. The English and French 
newspapers have both announced that the standard of war 
against the government of the Union is ready to be raised in 
Massachusetts, but I think I know too much of the charac 
ter and disposition of my countrymen for this to be possible. 
It is however certain, that as regards our relations with the 
rest of mankind the Massachusetts legislature has taken the 



450 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

lead of a system diametrically opposite to that of the na 
tional government. I am also well aware that the radical 
absurdity of the Massachusetts system is yet a problem for 
the solution of time. That it will eventually be demon 
strated to the conviction of all mankind, every day s ex 
perience more and more strongly convinces me. Austria, 
Prussia, and Sweden, and even Russia, have learnt this lesson 
at heavier cost than we have. My only concern is, lest in 
the instability of our humors, we should before we finish 
risk our fortunes upon the same stake which they have lost. 



TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 

No. 17. [ROBERT SMITH] 

ST. PETERSBURG, 25 June, 1810. 
SIR: 

I have the honor to enclose a copy in the French language 
of a manifesto just published here, proposing a public loan 
to be received in the paper money of the country, and the 
sale of certain public domains for the redemption of this 
paper. It will serve at once to show the disordered state of 
the finances of the Empire, and the laudable efforts of the 
present government to retrieve them. 

The assignation bank bills are the only currency in com 
mon circulation. They are the representatives and sub 
stitute of the copper coin. During the reign of the Empress 
Catherine this bank was established, and bills of IOO, of 50, 
25, 10 and 5 roubles were issued, upon their amount in cop 
per, deposited, or supposed to be deposited, at the bank. As 
the government contracted no obligation to redeem the bills 



i8ic] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 451 

upon presentation in gold or silver, the bulk and weight of 
the metal represented by the paper operated as a security 
against the pressure of extraordinary calls, and as the ne 
cessities of the government arose the bills continued to multi 
ply until all the copper mines of the Empire would not have 
sufficed for their redemption. The natural effect of this 
multiplication was depreciation in the value of the bills, and 
when the sums issued had amounted to one hundred millions 
of roubles, the Empress Catherine published a declaration 
that she would not exceed that emission. Her successor, 
however, not conceiving himself bound by that stipulation 
resumed the practice of supplying his wants by the manu 
facture of assignation paper, which has continued to swell 
in quantity and to shrink in value, until the amount in 
circulation is supposed to exceed six hundred millions of 
roubles, and until the paper rouble passes current in all pay 
ments for a little more than one third of a rouble in silver. 
The promise, that no more paper of this bank should 
henceforth be issued, was renewed in a prior manifesto pub 
lished in February last, soon after the new organization of the 
Imperial Council. At present, this loan upon terms ex 
tremely favorable to the lenders and proportionably burden 
some to the government is proposed for the purpose of 
withdrawing from circulation some part of that excess, which 
has occasioned the depreciated state of the bills. The prop 
osition to receive two paper roubles for one in silver, to pay 
the interest annually of six per cent upon that rouble in silver, 
and at the expiration of seven years, to repay the capital 
itself also in silver, is equivalent at the present rate of the 
money to a yearly interest of nine per cent, and an addition of 
fifty per cent to the capital at the close of the term. In the 
sale of the lands there are held out further advantages to the 
lenders, of no inconsiderable importance. The loan is to be 



452 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

opened on the I5th of July, but neither this manifesto, nor 
the recent accounts of the splendid victories obtained over 
the Turks have yet raised the value of paper assignations in 
the market. . . . 

The British fleet under the command of Sir James Sau- 
marez * has entered the Baltic, and to the number of twenty 
ships of the line, and a proportionable number of frigates and 
smaller armed vessels, is stationed at the various passages 
of entrance to that sea. The admiral himself is before 
Gothenburg, and has made a declaration, that no vessel ex 
cepting such as are provided with British licenses will be 
permitted by him to pass either to or from any port from 
which the British flag is excluded. From this order he has 
also declared that American vessels are not excepted, and I 
am informed that he has turned back an American vessel 
coming from Kiel in Holstein, bound to St. Petersburg, and 
endorsed her papers not to proceed to any port from which 
the British flag is excluded. It was on the 24th of May that 
he made the declaration that American vessels were included 
in his orders, which it appears were not known among the 
merchants of London on the 22nd of the same month. 

They are said to have been issued since the appointment of 
Mr. Yorke 2 as first Lord of the Admiralty. The late charge 
des affaires of Sweden in London, Mr. Brinckmann 3 has al 
ready returned to his own country, and Mr. Foster, who was 
in the same capacity at Stockholm, has been ordered to leave 
that kingdom, an order with which he declined to comply, 
until it was communicated to him in writing. There is no 
doubt but that the Swedish Government has submitted to 
take this step with great reluctance; but it was the price of

3 Charles-Gustave Brinckmann (1764-1848). 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 453 

their peace with Russia, and more especially with France. 
The consequences to the Swedish commerce will be serious. 
Admiral Saumarez has already taken a great number of 
Swedish vessels, and as the rupture is avowedly made by 
Sweden herself, it is hardly to be expected that any of the 
captured vessels will escape confiscation. 

I have received lately from Mr. George Joy two English 
copies of the new Danish privateering law; one of which I 
enclose to you with this letter. Under this law, nearly one 
hundred vessels had before the first of the present month 
been taken into Copenhagen; about twenty of which are 
Americans, some of them directly from the United States, 
captured after entering at Elsineur, and paying the duties on 
the passage of the Sound. I have mentioned these circum 
stances to the Baron de Blome, the Danish minister at this 
court, and suggested to him the hardship of this course of 
proceeding. He has repeatedly intimated to me a wish that 
there were some authorised officer of the United States at 
Copenhagen, to make suitable representations to the gov 
ernment itself. Those of a consul, he observed, could not 
carry with them the weight which would have much influence; 
but it is extremely doubtful whether any representations 
would overpower the prevalence of the privateering influence, 
stimulated by that of France. The resignation of Count 
Bernstorff, the principal cabinet minister, and head of the 
Department of Foreign Affairs, is viewed as indicating the 
prospect of increasing rigor rather than of relaxation on 
the part of that government. The Baron de Rosenkranz 
who is appointed in his stead is at Paris on a special mission, 
and Count Bernstorff retains the management of the foreign 
department, until his return. . . .

TO THOMAS BOYLSTON ADAMS 

ST. PETERSBURG, 30 June, 1810. 

We are expecting to hear from day to day of a great battle 
in Spain, and the continuance of the war or the restoration 
of peace is supposed to depend upon its event. Spain and 
Portugal are the only remaining parts of the European con 
tinent which furnish a pretext for continuing the war on the 
part of England, but there is so much internal fermentation 
in that country just now, that her government may very 
possibly find it necessary to maintain at all hazards a foreign 
war, to procure peace within her own islands. With regard 
to commerce, the two parties have already come to an ar 
rangement de facto, which suits the purpose of both. All 
neutrality and neutral trade are by common consent of the 
belligerents annihilated. The British at settled prices grant 
licenses to any flag, French as well as any other, which are 
respected by her navy. The Emperor Napoleon gives li 
censes to any flag, English as well as any other, which are 
respected by all his subordinate authorities. All other com 
merce is proscribed, and under these double licenses the 
commerce between the British islands and the continent of 
Europe is now carried on, to an extent beyond that of the 
most active and prosperous times of peace. France and 
England both raise a large revenue from their licenses, which 
ultimates as a tax upon the consumption of the articles cir 
culating by this new method of trade. The people of Europe 
pay this tax with a good grace, and according to all appear 
ances our countrymen are prepared to pay it in like manner. 

I know not any news that it would be possible for me to 
give you from this place, unless it should be on the war be- 



JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 455 

tween Russia and the Turks. This is an object extremely- 
interesting here. But I do not suppose you would take much 
concern in a detail of the progress of the Russian arms. I 
was summoned last week to a Te Deum at the Imperial 
Chapel on account of the glorious victories of General 
Kamensky and the defeat of the Seraskier Peglivan. The 
said Seraskier, it seems, was taken, together with the fortress 
of Bazardgik and about 1,600 men, a remnant of 10,000, by 
storm; the 8,000 and odd hundred other Turks of the garrison 
were cut to pieces in the process of the capture. Te Deum 
laudamus for the loss of Russians in this achievement did 
not exceed in killed and wounded 700 men. Silistria sur 
rendered without waiting to be stormed. If you never heard 
the names of these places before, look for them upon a map. 
Eight thousand and some hundred of valiant Turks were 
butchered in the first of them, for which but eight days since 
I heard Christian priests and prince give solemn thanks to 
God. Ever affectionately yours. 



TO ABIGAIL ADAMS 

ST. PETERSBURG, 25 July, 1810. 

From the returns of the votes at the April election which 
we have seen, I consider it as beyond question that Mr. 
Gerry and Mr. Gray were chosen Governor and Lieutenant 
Governor of the State. But on the comparison of the votes 
from the several towns the prospect was, that a majority of 
both branches of the legislature still adheres to the politics 
of the two last years, in which case the Council must be of 
the same complexion, and the State authorities will not 
harmonize very cordially together. The changes, however, 



456 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

not only in Massachusetts, but in New Hampshire, Vermont, 
and Rhode Island, have been so unpropitious to the Anglo- 
federalists, that the prospect of a separate empire will not 
make much progress during the present year, and I cherish 
the hope that they will be so steadily discountenanced by 
the suffrages of the people in New England, that the father 
of them all will renounce them in despair, and turn the policy 
of the eastern sages, if not to something useful and honorable, 
at least to something less pestilential to their country and 
their posterity. To anything more pernicious, in my sincere 
opinion, the Prince of Darkness could not spur the most 
devoted of his instruments upon earth. 

The panic terrors of a war between the United States and 
England, which the majority of the legislature of Massachu 
setts last winter alleged in justification of their patriotic reso 
lutions in favor of Mr. Jackson, and against the government 
of the United States, are I hope before this tranquilized. I 
see, however, by a circular from the federal committee of 
Boston senators and representatives, that their palpitations 
of heart were still indicative of a great alarm, even after they 
had reason to apprehend that their governor would be sup 
planted in his office, and after their own news from England 
had informed them, that his Britannic majesty s ministers 
would not go to war to avenge Mr. Jackson, highly as they 
approved his spirited moderation, and deeply as they re 
sented the unprovoked insult upon him. 

I have too much respect for the characters of all those 
gentlemen who signed the federal circular, not to believe that 
their fears were real and sincere. But knowing and esteem 
ing as I do the judgment and understanding of them all, I 
can with difficulty conceive the obfuscation of intellect which 
could permit them, late in April, 1810, to be in dread of a 
war with England, or an alliance with France. There is 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 457 

something in the spirit of party which stupefies even those 
whom it cannot deprave, and which blinds the eyes, when it 
cannot succeed to vitiate the heart. 

The most remarkable political transactions of the present 
time are in Sweden. The late king 1 of that country labored 
under the same prejudices, as of late years have taken pos 
session of almost all the New England federalists. He not 
only hated Napoleon as he deserves, but he relied upon the 
friendship and protection of England. He lost Pomerania; 
he lost Finland, and he last of all lost his crown. The Swed 
ish Diet not only discarded him, but his children, excluded 
all his dependents with him from the succession, and sent to 
Norway for a prince of Holstein-Augustenburg 2 to be the 
successor to the Swedish throne. This prince accepted the 
offer, and early in the spring of the present year he came to 
Stockholm, and was at the same time adopted by the present 
king 3 as his son, and proclaimed Crown Prince or heir ap 
parent of Sweden. On the 29th of May, while reviewing a 
regiment of cavalry near Helsingborg, he was seized with an 
apoplexy, fell instantly senseless from his horse, and expired 
within half an hour after. During the short time that he 
had been at Stockholm, the simplicity of his manners and the 
affability of his disposition had rendered him very popular 
among the plebeian class, but had at the same time given 
offense and disgust to many of the nobility. These two or 
ders of society are upon very discordant terms with each 
othei in that kingdom, and the odium of the populace is the 
most exasperated against the nobles of the higher rank. The 
suspicion that the Crown Prince had been poisoned by a con 
spiracy of certain persons of the nobility was excited among 

1 Gustavus IV (1778-1837), dethroned in 1809. 

2 Christian Augustus.

the people of Stockholm, and became particularly concen 
trated upon Count Axel Fersen, 1 the Grand Marshal of the 
Kingdom, his sister Countess Piper, a Count Ugglas, and 
the Russian informal envoy, General von Suchtelen. On 
the day when the body of the Prince was carried into Stock 
holm, Count Fersen, going at the head of the procession 
which was to escort it, was attacked by a mob in the streets, 
sought refuge in a house, from which he was compelled to 
be brought out, and murdered with circumstances as horrible 
as any of those which marked the worst period of the French 
Revolution. The other suspected persons were preserved 
from the fury of the mob only because they could not get 
them in their power, and finally by the interposition of a 
military force, which was obliged to fire upon the people and 
killed a number of them. There had been a report of three 
physicians, who opened and examined the Prince s body, 
declaring in the most formal manner, that no symptom of 
any other than natural causes of his death appeared, nor 
is it yet explained, why the suspicions of the people of Stock 
holm were settled upon five or six persons, or how they be 
came so strong as to burst out into those furious excesses. 
Commissioners are appointed to inquire and trace the sus 
picions of poison and their foundation, but here the opinion 
generally entertained is, that they are altogether groundless. 
All our intercourse with England is again open, and will 
be in all probability very great again. You will hear the 
accounts of interesting events on the continent so much 
sooner through England than we can send them from this 
bottom of the bag, that I shall have scarcely any other news 
to tell you. There has been, you know, for about four years, 
a personage called the king of Holland, a brother of the 
Emperor Napoleon, who sent him to rule over that country, 

1 Hans Axel, count von Fersen (1755-1810). 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 459 

as he now suggests for the benefit of France. King Louis, 
however, whether from natural disposition or from the con 
tagion of Dutch associates, appears to have imbibed an 
opinion, that a king of Holland ought to have some regard 
for the interests of Holland. This has brought him into 
disgrace with Napoleon, who first made him disgrace himself 
by a treaty, ceding to France a quarter part or more of the 
Dutch territories, and surrendering to French disposal all 
the private American property within his reach, and then 
sent a corps of French troops to take care of his good city of 
Amsterdam. Louis became sick of playing this part of a 
phantom king any longer, and has abdicated his crown, 1 and 
left it to his infant son, 2 under the regency of its mother, to 
perform the pageants and be used as the instruments of 
Napoleon. 

This illustrious character narrowly escaped a burnishing 
about three weeks since, at a splendid entertainment given 
by Prince Schwarzenberg, 3 the Austrian Ambassador at his 
court on the occasion of his marriage with the Archduchess 
Maria Louisa. In the midst of the ball the house took fire, 
and a number of the guests perished in the flames. The 
Emperor himself was present, but escaped unhurt. . . .

460 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 

No. 19. [ROBERT SMITH] 

ST. PETERSBURG, 3 August, 1810. 
SIR: 

When I wrote you three days since that no instance had 
occurred of a vessel having arrived in the Russian ports, with 
a forgery from the London market in the semblance of an 
American register, during the present season, I was mistaken. 
One case of that nature had occurred a few days before, of 
which I was not then informed; and our consul general, Mr. 
Harris, yesterday informed me of a note which he had just 
received from Count Romanzoff, enclosing a second. The 
first was a vessel called the Alpheus, Captain William H. 
Crosdale, (who I am sorry to say is an American,) which 
arrived at Cronstadt the 5/17 of July; and the second is the 
Culloden, Captain Charles Woodward, whose register pur 
ports to have been issued at Charleston, S. Carolina, in 
February last. This vessel entered, not at Cronstadt, but at 
some one of the other Russian ports. I have only seen this 
last paper, which appears to me to have been struck from 
the same plate which furnished the registers of the Weltha, 
Ann, and the Malvina. Mr. Harris however thinks it a dif 
ferent and more improved plate. 

The day before yesterday a courier arrived here, with an 
account of the death of the Queen of Prussia, 1 who had been 
upon a visit to her father at Strelitz; and died there, or on 
the way as she was returning to Berlin. A rumor is cir 
culated at the same time, which I have not yet had the op- 

1 Auguste Wilhelmine Amalie Luise (1776-1810), daughter of Prince Charles of 
Mecklenburg-Strelitz. 



JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 461 

portunity to authenticate, that the French, Austrian, and 
Westphalian ministers, have suddenly and at the same period 
left Berlin; though I have heard no cause for their departure 
assigned. I am afraid there is no reason to doubt the further 
report, that an ordinance has issued from the Prussian gov 
ernment, interdicting the admission of all vessels under the 
American flag, into any of the Prussian ports; the reason 
alleged for which is the same as that assigned by the Danish 
government for excluding our vessels from the ports of Ton- 
ning and Husum the abuse of our flag in facilitating the 
prohibited English trade. 

These events excite an unusual degree of attention here, as 
happening precisely at the period of the final reunion of all 
Holland with the French empire. On the 9th of July the 
Duke de Cadore, made a report to the Emperor Napoleon, 
laying before him the act of abdication of the king of Hol 
land, and recommending the annexation of Holland to 
France. He says that the king s act ought not to have ap 
peared without having been previously concerted with the 
Emperor; that it could be of no validity, without his con 
firmation, and that it ought not to be confirmed; that the re 
union of Belgium with France , had annihilated the inde 
pendence of Holland; that it is sinking under the load of its 
debts; that for the benefit, nay for the salvation of Holland, 
its reunion with the French empire is absolutely necessary; 
that besides it is necessary to make the boundaries of France 
secure; to complete the commercial and maritime system of 
his Imperial Majesty, and above all to strike the severest 
possible blow upon England. And that as to the young 
prince, so dear to his Imperial Majesty, (the king of Hol 
land s eldest son) the Grand Duchy of Berg was quite 
enough for him. 

On the same day, 9th of July, the Emperor, issued from 



462 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

his palace at Rambouillet a decree, by virtue of which Hol 
land is reunited to the French Empire; 1 Amsterdam is de 
clared the third city of the Empire (Rome was lately de 
clared the second); Holland is to have six senators, six 
deputies in the Council of State, twenty-five deputies in the 
Legislative Assembly, and two judges in the Court of Cassa 
tion, or Supreme Court of Appeals. The Duke of Piacenza 
(Le Brun) 2 is appointed the Emperor s Lieutenant-General 
at Amsterdam for the administration of affairs until 28 Jan 
uary, 1811, when the whole system of French administra 
tion is to commence. The public debt of Holland and its 
arrears of interest for the years 1808 and 1809 are reduced to 
one-third, and from the commencement of the next year the 
taxes are also to be reduced to the same rate with those of 
France. The colonial goods now in Holland, are to be left to 
the proprietors upon the payment of fifty per cent upon their 
value. The Legislative Assembly in Holland, is to appoint a 
committee of fifteen members to form a council at Paris, for 
making all the necessary arrangements for the definitive 
organization of the country under its new laws, and for 
adapting it to the local circumstances and general interests 
of the nation. 

The only part of this decree upon which I shall at present 
make any observation is that which relates to colonial goods. 
These are the American property, which by the treaty of last 
February was to be placed at the disposal of France, accord 
ing to the state of her relations with the United States. It 
is now ransomed for fifty per cent upon the value; and fur 
nishes a new comment upon what is still called the conti 
nental system. This ransom, of fifty per cent more or less, is 
the result of all the restrictions and prohibitions with which 

1 Annual Register, 1810, 502. 

2 Charles-Franfois Lebrun (1739-1824). 



JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 463 

for the last three years France has tormented the whole 
European continent. If English commerce was the object 
which France really intended to suppress, an extortion of 
fifty per cent would not be laid upon American property. 
If the property released were English and not American, 
even the fifty per cent would not be restored to its owners. 
The new exclusion of American vessels from the Prussian 
ports is probably a benefit to the English trade. There have 
been French inspectors and custom house officers in these 
ports during the whole of this season. I have advices from 
sources deserving credit, that by the permission or conniv 
ance of these French officers, English vessels and cargoes 
have been freely admitted, under any of their disguises, upon 
payment of fifteen per cent on the value. Vessels coming 
under the American flag could, of course, not be laid under 
this contribution. The effect of this distinction was that 
the Americans came more advantageously to the market, 
and when the Emperor Napoleon heard that English goods 
were introduced into the Prussian ports, his agents report to 
him that they came under the American flag. So the Amer 
ican flag is excluded from the Prussian ports, and for the 
rest of the season, the English ships will come as Pappen- 
burgers, Mecklenburgers, Danes, Swedes, Prussians, or un 
der any flag bought on the continent, or prepared in London, 
pay their hush money, which will perhaps now be raised 
higher than fifteen per cent, and have the market to them 
selves. The Emperor of France will learn no doubt that 
notwithstanding the exclusion of American vessels, English 
goods continue to obtain access in the Prussian ports. Then, 
perhaps, exclusion may be followed by sequester, and when 
that also is found to fail, the king of Prussia may be further 
called to account, and after all, the American property left 
to its owners upon payment of fifty per cent. On the other 



464 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

hand the English government taxes the same vessels and 
cargoes, though not yet quite so heavily for licenses; and 
such is the demand for colonial articles, as they are called, 
and English manufactures on the European continent, that 
this enormous double taxation, though it has raised the 
prices of all the articles, has had but little effect in diminish 
ing the consumption of them, and upon the commerce of 
England has not operated any injury at all. 

The sentence of confiscation has at length been sanctioned 
by the Emperor Alexander, upon the cargoes of the vessels 
which had entered as coming from the island of Teneriffe. 
The vessels, however, are to be liberated, and those which 
came in ballast are already discharged. There is an opinion, 
of the accuracy of which I am not certain, that a great pro 
portion of these cargoes has disappeared, and that the whole 
transaction will ultimately prove only another tax upon 
the owners of the goods. Now in this state of things the 
American trade here still enjoys the advantage which it has 
just lost in the Prussian ports. Not laying under so heavy 
contributions, it comes under more favorable circumstances 
to the competition of the market. But the inevitable con 
sequence will be, that the English goods introduced here will 
be represented as having been brought under the American 
flag a pretence which not only the French agents, but the 
real traffickers of the English commerce, will countenance, to 
get our countrymen excluded from the market. France has 
not yet ventured to speak to Russia in the style which she 
uses towards weaker powers; nor to prescribe to her any 
course of measures. She has no custom house officers in 
Russian ports, and neither her Ambassador nor her consuls 
have directly demanded any act of exclusion to Americans. 
But if the Americans are to answer for the introduction of 
British merchandize contrary to the prohibitions, such a 



iSio] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 465 

demand will not be delayed much longer. Of the indirect 
efforts to obtain exclusions of our trade which have been 
made, I have correct and precise information, which I shall 
communicate in a future letter, observing that as I have ob 
tained it from very confidential sources, and as much of it 
is secret history, it is important that it should remain such. 
I am, with the highest respect, etc. 



TO WILLIAM GRAY 

ST. PETERSBURG, 3 August, 1810. 
DEAR SIR: 

I received a few days since your favor of 21 April, enclosing 
the credit upon your correspondents here, at Hamburg, 
Copenhagen and London, for which I give you thanks. On 
my first arrival here I had apprehended, that I should be 
under the absolute necessity of incurring immediate ex 
penses, for which no provision is made by the government of 
the United States, and for which I could draw only upon the 
resources of my own property. As in this country, more 
than in any other of Europe, a man s estimation in the public 
opinion is solely proportioned to the style of expense in 
which he lives, and as it is considered as a sort of law of na 
tions here, that a public minister must live in splendor and 
magnificence, I saw myself placed between the alternative 
of squandering in a residence here of two or three years the 
means of subsistence to my family and of education to my 
children, or of incurring a reputation for parsimony, not to 
call it by a harsher name, which would expose me personally 
to great obloquy, and, what was infinitely more important 
in my view, which might have an injurious effect upon the 
character and interests of my country. I had, however, 



466 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

settled for myself early in life a principle which I had every 
reason to consider as a just one, from which I had never de 
parted since it had been possible for me to put it in practice, 
and to which I had already made too many sacrifices of 
vanity and ostentation to give it up now without reluctance. 
It was to keep my domestic expenses within the bounds of my 
income. 1 I soon found that I had no other choice left, but 
to renounce this principle forever, and beggar my family by 
a few months of extravagance, or to brave the opinions of 
the world around me, and make not their esteem but my 
own resources the measure of my expense. I had no hesita 
tion in making my choice, to which as yet I have adhered. I 
have begun by putting myself upon an establishment far 
below that of all the other foreign ministers here; a measure 
for which I have no other justification, than that their salaries 
are at least the double of mine, and that on the establishment 
upon which I have placed myself, if I should stay here two 
years or return home within that period, I shall have ex 
pended every cent of my allowance from the United States, 
and about all, if not the whole, of my income besides. Of 
the effect of this resolution upon my own reputation I can 
not be ignorant, but I am happy to possess, in the very 
strongly marked attentions of the Emperor to myself and 
my family, as well as in the proceedings and explicit assur 
ances of his ministers, an unequivocal proof that it has not 
in any manner impaired the interest or credit of our country 
at this court.

TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 

No. 21. [ROBERT SMITH] 

ST. PETERSBURG, 16 August, 1810. 
SIR: 

The following is a translation of the Prussian ordinance, 
for breaking off all commercial intercourse with the United 
States of America. 

His Royal Majesty of Prussia, our most gracious Lord, finds 
himself induced, for the more effectual preservation of the con 
tinental system heretofore adopted in concert with the Imperial 
Court of France, and hitherto rigorously observed in all the com 
mercial transactions of his subjects; and for the more perfect 
security in guarding against all and every abuse, which may have 
been practiced in the execution of the former ordinances, hereby 
to close all his ports, against American vessels altogether, and 
without exception. In consequence whereof, from the day of the 
present publication of this ordinance, no vessel coming from an 
American port, or belonging to an American citizen or subject, 
shall be admitted and received into the ports of this country; but 
every vessel of that nation is immediately and without delay on 
appearance before a Prussian harbor or road to be turned away. 
The present ordinance is hereby publicly made known, to be re 
spected, and put into the most rigorous execution; and every 
person contravening the same, besides the confiscation of the 
vessel and cargo, shall be subject to special prosecution and punish 
ment. Berlin, 19 July, 1810. 

By his Royal Majesty s most gracious special order. (Signed.) 
HARDENBERG GOLTZ DOHNA KIRCHEISER. 

It is not improbable that in the ports of Prussia, where 
there is I believe no American public consul or commercial 
agent, to detect the forgeries of American papers, from the 
London market, there have been numerous instances of cases 



468 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

similar to those which have been detected here and else 
where. The necessities of commerce upon the continent are 
so much stronger than the power of France, that every 
measure of force adopted to obstruct it is immediately met 
by a measure of fraud to counterbalance its effects. All the 
merchants in every port of the continent in this curious con 
test are on the English side those of France more, and 
more effectually, than all the rest. As a proof of which may 
be noticed not only the numerous licenses signed by the 
Emperor Napoleon himself under which a direct trade be 
tween France and England is carried on, but the partial 
opening of the French ports to American vessels, precisely 
at the moment when the king of Prussia has found himself 
induced to shut his. The rigor of the public restrictions 
would leave scarcely any trade at all were they susceptible of 
execution; but their final result is rather to raise the rates of 
insurance and the prices of the articles, than to injure the 
commerce or revenues of England. The merchants in Eng 
land and upon the continent, united by a common interest, 
and stimulated by the high prices at which the very prohibi 
tions and ransoms keep the forbidden articles, have as little 
scruple as to the means by which they shall evade the regu 
lations of the governments as the governments have in the 
choice of their restrictive measures. But it is obvious that 
a trade subject to such heavy risques and contributions could 
not be continued, if vessels under the American flag were ex 
empted from them. In such a case the Americans must 
come to the market under such advantages that the English 
traders could stand no competition with them. When, there 
fore, it is discovered that the British trade cannot be raised 
to the level of advantage by means of forgery, it becomes nec 
essary to sink the American trade to the level of extortions; 
and in this respect as in the rest, the interest of the conti- 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 469 

nental merchants, being the same with that of the English, 
they have no motive to favor the Americans, and certainly 
do not favor them. There is no doubt but that great num 
bers of vessels from England with English cargoes have been 
this summer received in the Prussian ports. Some of them, 
but probably not many, have gone with forged papers, and 
assumed the American flag. Many real Americans coming 
directly from the United States have also entered there. The 
French government learn that English goods are introduced 
into Prussia. The custom house officers, who have not re 
ceived, and could not exact from Americans the price of 
connivance; the merchants really connected with the British 
speculations, and all the political secret partisans of England, 
that is to say, in the Prussian dominions almost everybody, 
all with one common voice charge the whole to the account 
of the American flag, and the king of Prussia has it signified 
to him that the American flag must be totally excluded from 
his ports. 

In Stralsund all the property imported in American vessels 
was some time since sequestered; in Dantzick it appears the 
same measures have been taken. The exclusion of Americans 
has not yet been formally demanded here, but the system 
must soon bring forward such a demand. In my interview 
with Count Romanzoff, on the 8th inst. he assured me of the 
desire of this government to give every possible facility to the 
direct commerce, between the United States and this coun 
try, but I have reason to believe that disposition would not resist 
a positive demand of France, which I expect every day. 1 

The Swedish Assembly of the States met at Orebro, on the 
23rd of last month, but no account of their proceedings has 
yet arrived here. The king of Denmark 2 is understood to

2 Frederick VI. 



470 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

have written a long letter to the present king of Sweden, 
stating to him the urgent necessity of uniting again the two 
kingdoms under one sovereign, to secure the existence of 
either, and requesting him to propose him the said king of 
Denmark as his successor to the crown of Sweden. It is 
also known that the king of Denmark has been encouraged 
to take this step by the assurance of all the influence of 
France in his favor. The opinion is that it was even first 
suggested to him by France, and the belief is that it will 
eventually be successful. In what point of view it is contem 
plated here, I have not understood. I know that the Em 
peror Alexander, on being informed of the decease of the 
late Crown Prince, and the subsequent convocation of the 
States for settling again the succession to the Crown, in 
structed his minister in Sweden not to interfere in the slight 
est degree, upon this occasion; but as the Prince of Holstein 
Oldenburg, 1 who married the Grand Duchess Catherine, 
sister of the Emperor of Russia, has been considered as one 
of the principal persons having pretensions to this new suc 
cession, as that settlement is apparently more propitious to 
the general interests of Russia than any other, and as the 
revival of the ancient union of the three northern crowns 
has the tendency to give Russia one neighbor much more 
powerful than they can be in the state of separation, the 
political speculators conclude that Russia must be displeased 
with this arrangement in favor of the king of Denmark. . . . 
The French newspapers assert as from authority that all 
certificates of origin, purporting to be signed by French con 
suls in the United States and produced in the north of 
Europe, must be false, for that the French consuls in the 
United States have long since ceased to deliver any such 
certificates. The French government must be singularly

misinformed, with regard to the acts of its own agents 
hitherto; but probably they have forbidden to issue any more 
such certificates in future. I have the honor, etc. 

TO WILLIAM GRAY 

ST. PETERSBURG, 19 August, 1810. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

About three weeks ago the Emperor Alexander inspected 
his naval force, and held a review at Cronstadt. Two black 
men belonging to American vessels in that port attracted 
his notice on the parade, and he spoke to them. One of them 
afterwards came up to St. Petersburg, and obtained the Em 
peror s permission to enter his service as a domestic, pro 
vided he was under no engagements incompatible with it. 
The Minister of the Police, by his Majesty s orders, sent 
me a message to inquire, whether a release from the man s 
engagements on board the vessel could be obtained for a 
competent indemnity to the owners or master of the vessel, 
and whether I could procure the man s wife and children to 
be sent here as the man had solicited, and for the expenses of 
whose passage his Majesty would give orders that payment 
should be made. 

The vessel to which the man had belonged was the Presi 
dent Adams, Captain Field of Providence. She had already 
sailed from Cronstadt without him, when I received the mes 
sage. The man himself came to me, and I have promised to 
write and request that his wife and children may be sent here. 
As I presume you will have occasion to send some of your 
ships here the next spring, I do not know of any way in which 
the object can better be obtained than by requesting your 
attention to it. The man s name, he says, is Claude Gabriel. 



472 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

He is a native of Martinique, and has been about ten years 
in America. He lived three years with Mr. William Jones, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives in Rhode Island. 
His wife s name is Prudence. She lives by herself at Provi 
dence. He has one child, a daughter named Annette, about 
three years old, and he supposes another born since he came 
from Providence, last November. He came in the ship with 
Captain Field as steward. If you can inform Captain Field, 
or his owners at Providence, that the Emperor has given 
orders to indemnify them for any injury which the loss of 
the man from the ship may have occasioned, and will have 
the goodness to pay it, if they have any demand on that ac 
count, and inform me of the amount, his Majesty s intentions 
will be accomplished. The necessary expenses for the pas 
sage of the woman and children will also be immediately 
paid on their arrival here. 1 

1 "Just as I am writing I receive a visit from Nelson, the black man-servant 
whom I brought with me from America. He left us about four months ago, to 
enter the service of his Imperial majesty, who has about a dozen menial attendants 
of that color, and who when vacancies happen in the number by death (there are, 
as you will readily suppose, none by resignation) finds it not altogether easy to 
supply the places. I had not been here very long before Nelson found out that it 
would be possible for him to obtain that situation, if he could have my consent; for 
his majesty s Grand Marshal refused to take him upon any other terms, and oblig 
ingly assured me, that he should be taken only in case it was perfectly agreeable 
to me, and not at all, if I chose to keep him. However, as it was making him a 
fortune for his life, and as I had neither the inclination, nor in my own mind the 
right, to keep him against his own will, as soon as I could conveniently provide 
myself with a man in his stead, I gave him his discharge, and a recommendation to 
the Grand Marshal, who immediately engaged him as an attendant at the Imperial 
table. He comes now and then to see us in his splendid Moorish dress, and is highly 
satisfied with his new service, of which he finds nothing irksome, but the various 
masters of genteel accomplishments which have been given him to complete his 
education." To Abigail Adams, 5/17, December, 1810. Ms.

TO JOSEPH HALL 

ST. PETERSBURG, 15/27 August, 1810. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

You are severe upon the political foresight and compre 
hensive views of our federal friends. I shall not undertake to 
be their champion. What I have staked upon a principle in 
opposition to them is, perhaps, better known to you than 
to any man living. The trial between their political prin 
ciples and mine, which as you know the outrage upon the 
Chesapeake frigate first brought to a direct issue, I consider as 
still sub judice. If the correctness of political views were 
tested only by the event, there have been circumstances and 
moments which looked most inauspicious to my cause. But 
as, when they occurred, I was not dejected by them, so now, 
that the people of New England and New York have shown 
their deliberate sense of the matter, I hope I am not in 
clined to exult even internally too much at this issue, es 
pecially when the pleasure of finding myself justified by the 
event must be mingled with the pain of seeing, that it must 
be at the expense of mortification and disappointment to 
so many of my personal friends. The moral poet tells us 
that self-love and social are the same. This sentiment may 
at least with equal justice be applied to the special interest of 
parties in our country, as to the egotism of individuals. 
The fanaticism (for that is the mildest term by which it can 
be designated), with which the New England federalists 
have linked themselves and their cause with Old England 
and her fortunes, is and must be as pernicious to them as a 
party, as it would prove to their country, could they draw 
her into their political system founded on the same prej- 



474 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

udices. The philological speeches, the New York and Mas 
sachusetts resolutions were, indeed, but parts of one stu 
pendous whole. They were in perfect consistency with the 
patriotic proceedings of the two preceding years, but they who 
got them up should have seen that they were no longer suited 
to the temper of the public pulse. I find by the newspapers, 
which I have received down to the ijth of June, that not 
only the rank and file federalists, but even grave legislators 
who wrote caucussing circulars, can think of no other [cause] 
for the disasters of their electioneering ticket, than some silly 
tale about the king of England s having disapproved the 
conduct of Mr. Jackson, which they allege to have been cir 
culated at the critical moment from Washington. Maryland 
and Vermont the last autumn, and New Hampshire which 
had gone just before them, might have taught them that 
there was some other cause in operation besides Air. Pink- 
ney s private letter, to take votes from them, and give them to 
their adversaries. But even after their own April election, it 
seems, they saw not the least reason for a diminution of their 
confidence, that they would still have a majority in the 
House of Representatives after their own hearts. Their 
game is, however, not yet lost, for they have still a tie in the 
Senate of the State. I presume that even now, even when 
you may probably receive this letter, it will be impossible 
to foresee, what the result of the next annual election will 
be. It will, as it always does, depend in a great measure upon 
the events of the year. As the leading federalists, some of 
whom at one time last summer professed a disposition to 
support Mr. Madison s administration, have so decidedly 
made their election to be in opposition to it, I cannot flatter 
myself with any prospect that their views of public affairs 
will soon, if ever, coincide with mine more than for the last 
three years. I cannot, therefore, wish them success. But 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 475 

so long as they shall adhere to a system in my estimation so 
incompatible with the interests, and so derogatory to the 
honor of my country, as that which they have pursued since 
the base and unatoned attack upon the Chesapeake, I can 
only pray that their measures may be of a stamp with the 
Massachusetts and New York resolutions of last winter, in 
honor of the firebrand Jackson. If they will but move a few 
more impeachments, analyze a few more correspondences, 
unveil a little more of Mr. Madison s diplomatic policy, 
preach a few more thanksgiving, fast-day and election ser 
mons, and compile a few more volumes of posthumous works , 
I do not despair of seeing the State of Connecticut and Dela 
ware as much edified by their labors, as already have been 
the rest of New England and New York. 



TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 

No. 22. [ROBERT SMITH] 

ST. PETERSBURG, 19/31 August, 1810. 
SIR: 

By Mr. W[illiam] B. Adams, who arrived about ten days 
since, at Archangel, I have had the honor of receiving two 
dispatches from you the first dated 5 May, with a copy of 
your answer to a letter from Mr. Daschkoff, containing some 
proposals respecting the trade between the United States, 
and the Indians connected with the Russian establishments 
on the northwestern coast of America. 1 Your letter to me 

1 "You will herewith receive copies of a letter from Mr. Daschkoff and of my 
answer. They relate as you will perceive to a subject of a very delicate character. 
The Russian government, it would seem, considers the United States bound to 
restrain their citizens from trading in warlike articles with the Indians connected 



476 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

on this subject (which is a duplicate) mentions a copy of 
Mr. DaschkofPs letter to you, as well as of your answer to it, 

with the Russian establishments on the northwestern coast of America. This is 
manifestly an error. If the Indians be under the Russian jurisdiction, the United 
States are bound only to leave their citizens to the penalties operating within the 
territorial limits. If the Indians are to be considered as independent tribes in 
habiting an independent territory, Russia cannot of right prohibit other nations 
from trading with them, unless it be in contraband of war during a state of war, 
in which case she may enforce the prohibition on the high seas. If the Indians 
should fall under the character of rebels or insurgents against Russian authority the 
same rule may be applicable. In this view of the subject, the United States being 
under no legal obligation to comply with the demand of Russia, they can no other 
wise be brought under such obligation than by compact; and whatever disposition 
they may feel to seek for a foundation and of friendship, it would be difficult to 
attain the end in that mode, without maintaining a right which this nation has not 
yet asserted in opposition to the Spanish claim to the western coast of America 
south of that of Russia, and consequently without a contest unseasonable and pre 
mature, at least, with the Spaniards. The United States might indeed by a gra 
tuitous regulation yield to the wishes of the Emperor on this subject, and certainly 
it would be very agreeable to them to give proofs on every occasion of their friend 
ship for his Imperial Majesty. But such a measure is not within the authority of 
the executive, and could not well be formally proposed to the legislature without 
the usual basis of mutual stipulation. 

"These remarks may assist you in placing the subject before the Russian govern 
ment in a light best fitted to satisfy them. It may be added that as Russia has the 
means of enforcing its own rights against those who intrude on the coast possessed 
by her, or who are carrying implements of war to be used in hostility against her, 
it cannot be essential that any foreign power should cooperate with her for the pur 
pose. 

"In explaining the sentiments of the United States on this occasion, it will be 
advisable for you to bring into view the hopes of the United States that it will be 
found consistent with the liberal policy of the Emperor to favor a commerce of 
the Americans in innocent articles, both with the Russians and Indians in that 
quarter, and even their intercession in the trade between the Russian establish 
ments and China. 

"As it does not appear how far the Russians stretch their claim southwardly 
along the coast, it is material that some latitude should be fixed as the limit, and it 
is desirable, as the coast south of it will enter into the plan of Indian trade likely to 
be embraced by our citizens, that the limit should be as little advanced south 
wardly as may be. It appears from what passed between Spain and Great Britain 
in the affair of Nootka Sound in the year 1790, that the claim of the former extended 



JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 477 

as being enclosed; but the packet contained only the copy of 
your answer, and not that of Mr. DaschkofPs letter, which I 
presume is in the original despatch not yet received. Al 
though from the papers which have thus come to hand I can 
collect generally the substance of the proposition, and your 
sentiments relating to it, yet while ignorant of the precise 
purport of Mr. DaschkofFs propositions, I shall be able to 
do nothing more than intimate to the Chancellor that you 
consider difficulties as standing in the way of this negotia 
tion; and refer for further explanation to the time when I 
shall have received your despatch containing both the docu 
ments to which your letter refers me. . . . 

The Prussian ordinance for the exclusion of American 
vessels from the ports of that kingdom has been followed by 
similar regulations of the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, 
and of the king of Denmark, extending to all the ports of 
Holstein the prohibition which had previously been limited 
to the ports of Husum and Tonning. The following is an 
exact translation of the Duke of Mecklenburg s ordinance: 

Whereas it has been made manifest by manifold experience, that 
the North American flag has been abused by the English, to intro 
duce prohibited wares, and to effect the secret evasion of the well 
known commercial regulations of the Emperor of France; and 

to the 6oth degree of latitude." Secretary of State to John Quincy Adams, May 5, 
1810. Ms. 

"In the course of a few days I purpose to ask a conference with the Chancellor, 
Count Romanzoff, on the subject referred to in Mr. Daschkoff s letter. The diffi 
culty of fixing upon a boundary within which a prohibition of trade could be stipu 
lated, I suppose will not easily be removed. I know not whether it had been con 
templated when the proposition was first made, but the necessity of fixing upon a 
line is obvious. Mr. Harris has communicated to me copies of his correspondence 
with Count Romanzoff, and t .ie memorials of the Russian American Company 
relative to the object. I find by them that the Russian claim was asserted to the 
mouth of Columbia River." To the Secretary of State, September 30, 1810. Ms.

whereas for a long time past no colonial productions have been 
ship d and exported from the real American ports, therefore the 
military officers, in our sea ports of Rostock and Wismar, are 
hereby expressly commanded, from this time forth not to admit 
any more North American vessels, with what papers, and under 
what pretext soever they may present themselves, but on the 
contrary to keep special and severe watch, that all such be im 
mediately turned away and the military officers are hereby made 
responsible for the strict execution of this order. 

FREDERICK FRANCIS. 
Doberan, 29 July, 1810. 

The Danish order, or as they call it there, chancery- 
patent, is not so ready at the assignment of a reason. It says : 

His Royal Majesty has found himself occasioned, by the cir 
cumstances of the time to extend to all the ports of the Duchy of 
Holstein, the exclusion of North American vessels, already com 
manded at the Ports of Husum and Tonning, so that every North 
American vessel, which after publication of this sovereign ordi 
nance shall come to any port of the Duchy of Holstein, shall with 
out breaking bulk be turned away, in like manner, as on the I5th 
of June was ordained for the ports of Husum and of Tonning. This 
Sovereign Resolution is hereby made known to all whom it may 
concern, that they may conform themselves thereto accordingly.

Notwithstanding the apparent rigor of these orders, 
numbers of American vessels have been suffered to approxi 
mate the Prussian ports at least, sufficiently to discharge 
their cargoes, on a proper explanation of circumstances to 
the French consuls. I have no doubt but that they have ob 
tained the same access in the ports of Mecklenburg and 
Holstein. You know the American property which had been 



JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 479 

seized in Holland has finally been ransomed at a duty of forty 
per cent. I have just now learnt that on the /th of August 
the Berlin and Milan decrees were revoked, 1 and that from 
and after the 1st of November next, all the colonial articles 
are to be admitted into the ports of France upon the pay 
ment of duties so enormous that one would think they must 
be equivalent to prohibitions: American cotton, for instance, 
at nearly 60 cents a pound, sugar 30 and 40, coffee 40, cocoa 
I dollar, teas from 40 to 80 cents, and indigo 2 dollars. As 
the demand for some of these articles is such that they must 
eventually be purchased at any price, and as contraband 
will always triumph over such duties as these, I cannot 
imagine it is intended to keep them up at this standard. But 
after levying contributions of forty or fifty per cent upon the 
stock of the merchants on hand, to enable them to pay this 
tax without being ruined by its operation, these duties may 
now be fixed among other reasons to raise the prices of that 
stock on hand to a level adequate to the proportion of the 
property extracted from it. In short, sir, from the complexion 
of all the measures which I have recently witnessed emanat 
ing from France, the continental system, whatever may have 
been its original design, appears terminating in a mere tax 
levied upon commerce by France, equal or more than equal 
to that which Great Britain has levied by the superiority of 
her naval power. I have not officially this account of the 
revocation of the decrees but receive it both from Hamburg 
and Amsterdam in such a manner as leaves me no reason to 
doubt its authenticity. It seems probable that it has been 
a subject of negotiation between France and England. It is 
to be hoped it will be immediately followed by the revocation 
of the Orders in Council, and of the blockade from the Elbe 
to Brest. 

1 This was an error. See Henry Adams, History, V. 253. 



4 8o THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

Mr. George Joy informs me that he has obtained from the 
Danish government the means of protecting in future from 
Danish capture all the American vessels which may arrive 
at Gothenburg. I have corresponded with this gentleman 
since his residence at Copenhagen, where he has certainly 
manifested much zeal and made great exertions in behalf of 
our unfortunate countrymen taken into the Danish ports. 
Though his success had not hitherto corresponded with his 
good intentions, he has at least been listened to as much as 
could be expected under all the circumstances of his situa 
tion. I believe that the want of a native American accredited 
agent of the government of the United States at Copenhagen 
has cost our country ten times more than the cost would 
have been of maintaining one there, even with the character 
of a public minister. The Danish minister here told me some 
time since, that he was persuaded much of what our com 
merce there suffered might be remedied by the representa 
tions of a person duly accredited, and in an official station 
entitled to access to the highest authorities of the country. 

I cherish the hope that Mr. Joy s licenses will prove ef 
ficacious to protect our vessels in future. Several very 
recent and rich captures have however occurred. A convoy 
of fifty sail has been taken and carried into Christiansand, 
among which are at least eight Americans with very valuable 
cargoes, which sailed from Cronstadt for the United States 
in June. Some of them had despatches on board from me to 
your Department. 

We had last week a Te Deum celebrated at court, for a new 
victory over the army of the Grand Vizir at Shumla. An 
other action at Rustchuk is said to have been less favorable 
to the Russian arms. The Prince of Ponte Corvo (General 
Bernadotte) has been elected Crown Prince of Sweden. I 
have the honor, etc. 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 481 

TO JOHN ADAMS 

ST. PETERSBURG, 2 September, 1810. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

You say that you live in no apprehension of a war, foreign 
or domestic, the most pleasing and most happy state of 
things that can be announced. But in that I perceive your 
opinion differs widely from that of the caucussing-circular- 
letter legislators, who a month after the date of your letter 
had such a fearful foresight of a war with England and a 
French alliance. The federal party and the British faction 
are certainly not in our country the same thing. But for the 
last three years the federal party, in New England especially, 
have suffered themselves to be made so egregiously the dupes 
and the tools of the British faction, that they are most nat 
urally and most justly falling with them. If they would 
recover themselves in the sight of their country, they must 
tread back a great many of their steps. 

You have the news from England, France, Spain, Portugal 
and Italy, almost as soon as we have it here. I therefore 
write you little of it. You will know that England continues 
to reject time after time the overtures of peace made by 
France, and that Napoleon treats her as the Sibyl did Tar- 
quin for the price of her books. Last winter he offered to 
treat upon the basis of the uti possidetis. England would 
not hear of it; since which he has definitely made Hanover 
part of the kingdom of Westphalia. At the time of the mar 
riage Count Metternich, the Austrian Prime Minister, went 
to Paris, and sent new protestations to England, which have 
also terminated in nothing, and Napoleon has annexed all 
Holland to the French empire. He has now made a French 



482 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

general (Bernadotte), Crown Prince of Sweden. All this 
time England is haggling about Spain and Portugal. In 
those countries there seems to be a vis inertiae too powerful 
for either of the parties. They can neither be conquered by 
the French, nor defended by the English. Perhaps after 
all the peace will be made by a compromise, leaving them in 
a state of neutrality, or of partition between France and 
England. Independent they certainly will not be. 

One thing is so clear that even British ministers cannot 
much longer blind themselves to its evidence. The longer 
they continue the war, the more universally will it extend, 
and the more they will establish the control of France over 
the continent of Europe. On the other hand the demonstra 
tion is equally plain, that the longer France and her de 
pendencies adhere to what they call their continental sys 
tem, the more easily will England be able to maintain the 
war, and the more effectually to secure to herself the monop

TO SAMUEL LATHAM MITCHILL 

ST. PETERSBURG, 5 September, 1810. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

Many of our countrymen who have arrived at that port 
[Archangel] during the present season have met with great 
difficulties in obtaining admission, owing to the severity of 
the regulations for the exclusion of English vessels, and of 
vessels coming from English ports, both of which are pro 
hibitive. The difficulty of distinguishing between English 
and American vessels and mariners, especially by foreigners, 
the facilities and temptations which vessels really American 
have for coming from British ports, the forgery of ship s 
papers pretended American, of which there is such a flourish 
ing manufacture established in the city of London, and the 
interloping trade, which by the agency of some American 
individuals is supposed to be carried on with England in 
spite of all the prohibitions, together with the distance of 
the port of Archangel from this metropolis, and the want of 

majesty of France loves the Americans. His majesty s manner of showing love 
is peculiar to himself." To Alexander Hill Everett, September 3, 1810. Ms. 

"If, as is supposed by some, it [repeal of the decrees] was already concerted with 
England, by a mutual understanding that the corresponding steps should im 
mediately be taken upon her part, all our important difficulties are at an end, and 
an early peace between France and England may be expected. If on the contrary 
this conditional repeal has been announced only because it was known that Eng 
land on her part would not comply with the conditions, it will only give a new at 
titude to our embarrassments, and increase the danger of our being eventually 
drawn into the war." To Joseph Pitcairn, September 4, 1810. Ms.

an American consul there, and the very unusual number of 
American vessels which have arrived at that port this sum 
mer, have all concurred to raise obstacles to the reception of 
the genuine Americans, coming directly from the United 
States. Besides this, great and formidable efforts have been 
made, under a multitude of pretences and in a variety of 
shapes, to obtain the real exclusion of American vessels, or 
at least of the most valuable and important parts of their 
cargoes. Hitherto these efforts have been altogether with 
out success, and we have had every demonstration in fact 
as well as every formal and solemn assurance, that the dis 
position of the government is in a peculiar degree favorable, 
not only to the support and encouragement, but to the 
extension of the commercial relations between this country 
and the United States. 

I cannot but flatter myself that the revocation by the 
French Emperor of the Berlin and Milan decrees, though con 
ditional as it is, indicates a change of system which will 
relieve us at least from a part of the oppressions and vexa 
tions under which our commerce has so long labored, and 
from the dangers with which it is still threatened. Some of 
our countrymen heretofore have most vehemently, and you 
know how erroneously, pretended that in that series of out 
rages which we have suffered from both the great maritime 
belligerent powers, the first example was set by France. I 
am curious to know, how they will be affected by seeing the 
first step towards a return to justice and a sense of right 
actually taken by France. If this example is followed by 
England, of which we have had from her so many and such 
solemn promises, we shall at least once more have reason to 
expect some security to our property, and some respect for 
our rights upon the ocean. But if the war of commerce has 
really been given up, (as if England revokes her Orders of 



isioj JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 485 

Council and new blockade principles it evidently has been,) 
there will nothing be left about which they can long contend, 
and we shall probably have a peace before the next spring. 

I have not seen the Anthology review nor any other of my 
lectures. 1 On leaving home I requested my brother, when the 
lectures should be published to send you a set of them, of 
which as a token of my esteem and friendship I ask 
your acceptance. I hope you have before this time re 
ceived it. 

It would have given me pleasure to see the outline of your 
course of lectures upon natural history, and I hope one day to 
see the course itself published. 

The present is not a period very favorable to the arts and 
sciences in this country. The wars in which the empire has 
for several years been engaged, and the heavy expenses which 
they occasion, have introduced a depreciated paper cur 
rency, and have raised the prices of books and the materials 
of books to such a degree that literature suffers from it more 
severely. There is one work however of considerable im 
portance in the course of publication, the first volume of 
which both in the Russian and German languages has ap 
peared since my arrival. It is an account of the voyage round 
the world in the years 1803, 1804, 1805 and 1806, of two 
Russian ships under the command of Captain Krusenstern. 1 
He is himself the author of the narrative. It will be con 
tained in three quarto volumes, with a volume of maps and 
plates, to the execution of which the Emperor Alexander has 
appropriated one hundred thousand roubles. There is a 
French translation of this work announced at Paris by a Mr. 
Le Clerc, who is already known as the author of a general 
history of the Russian empire. An English translation will

TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 

No. 23. [ROBERT SMITH] 

September 5, 1810. 

He [RomanzofT] said 2 he had also received despatches from 
Mr. Daschkoff, stating that his application [in relation to a 
trade between the United States and a Russian settlement 
on the northwest coast of America] had been favorably re 
ceived by the government of the United States. That they 
had a growing settlement on the northwest coast of America, 
and that from it a profitable trade could be carried on to 
China; that they had sent two vessels there under the com 
mand of Captain Krusenstern, which had gone from there 
to Canton. Canton was a port open to all the nations of 
Europe; but the Russians, who are specially favored by the 
Chinese government, had an exclusive trade with them, 
carried on at a place called Kiakhta.* But the Chinese had 
refused to admit Captain Krusenstern s ships at Canton, on 
the pretext that as the Russian trade with them had long 
been carried on with exclusive privileges at Kiakhta, they 
supposed that if the Russians meant to change the channel 
of trade they would have given them notice of it. And as 
they had heard nothing about such vessels coming to Can 
ton, they could not tell whether they were really Russians or

Memoirs.

ing of the Suez Canal. 



JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 487 

not. There had been, the Count said, some sheets passed 
between the two governments since on the subject, but the 
convulsed state of Europe, and objects of so much greater 
magnitude, had so absorbed his attention, that they had not 
yet come to any arrangement with them for the admission 
of Russian vessels at Canton. He had therefore wished that J 
the trade from the Russian settlement on the northwest / 
coast of America to China might be carried on by the Amer- I 
leans. And as the settlement itself is in the neighborhood 
of Indians, who were sometimes troublesome and dangerous 
neighbors to it, he had thought an arrangement might be 
concerted with the United States, under which the Amer 
icans might have the trade of the settlement, under a re 
striction not to furnish warlike weapons and instruments to 
the neighboring Indians. 1 

I told him I collected from the papers which I had re 
ceived that Mr. Daschkoff was not specifically instructed 
as to the limits within which it was wished that the restric 
tion should be extended, and asked whether he could point 
them out to me. He said that it would require some con 
sideration, but that their maps included the whole of Nootka 
Sound, and down to the mouth of Columbia River, as part 
of the Russian possessions. It will be unnecessary for me to 
say anything further to the Count upon this subject until I shall 
have received your original despatch, enclosing the copy of Mr. 
Daschkoff s letter to you containing the proposal on the part of 
Russia. I do not imagine that it is the Count s serious inten 
tion to claim to the mouth of the Columbia River; but perhaps 
the fixing upon a boundary may present difficulties to ike pro 
posed convention which had not been anticipated. In the mean 
time the Count manifested no objection to the carrying on of the 

1 A digression on Russia s diplomatic intercourse with China is in Adams, Mem 
oirs, August 28, 1 8 10. 



4 88 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

trade between the settlements by American vessels. 1 And as 
Russia s vessels are not admitted at Canton, it is much for 
the interest of the settlement that vessels which have access 
there should come and take their peltries to carry them. This 
can be done so conveniently, and probably so cheaply, by no 
others as by the Americans. 2 

I took the opportunity of this same conference to converse 
with the Count upon the difficulties which our countrymen 
experience in obtaining admission into the Russian ports, of 
which there were some complaints made to me from Cron- 
stadt, and many from Archangel. The imperial ordinances 
prohibit, under pain of confiscation of the cargoes, the en 
trance of vessels from English ports or ports of other nations 
with which Russia is at war; and also of articles of mer 
chandise, the growth or produce of such countries. To this 
number is now added by the ordinance of the ^^ May last 
the ports of Portugal on the continent of Europe which are 
understood to be in possession of the English. A number of 
American vessels, however, have arrived at Archangel from 
Lisbon and Oporto, which sailed from those ports before any 
notice had been given that they could not be admitted as 
coming from thence into Russia, and with papers duly au 
thenticated by the Russian consuls. On presenting them 
selves at Archangel they were not admitted to an entry and 
one of them at least had after examination of the papers been 
ordered to depart within thirty days. One other being under 
absolute necessity of undergoing repairs before she could 
sail, had been allowed to discharge her cargo, giving bonds 
to take it on board again when the necessary repairs should 
be completed. The captains of both these vessels addressed 
themselves directly to me, requesting me to obtain, if pos- 

1 Italics represent cypher. 

2 See Adams, Memoirs, October 9, 1810. 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 489 

sible, permission for them to enter, and to dispose of their 
cargoes. Several applications of a similar kind were also 
made to our consul, Mr. Harris, to whose department they 
more properly belonged than to mine. I had, however, in a 
personal interview with Count Romanzoif early in the last 
month urged to him all the equitable considerations which 
pleaded for the admission of these vessels. With regard to 
the one which had taken damage and required repairs the 
Count had given encouragement to expect that an exception 
would be made in his favor, and on that case he desired me 
to write him an official note. As to the rest he gave me the 
answer which I had expected, that to a measure general in 
its nature and arising from the state of war, it was not pos 
sible to allow particular exceptions on account of the mere 
want of previous notice. But in writing the note I renewed 
the application generally as well as that for the particular 
case of the damaged vessel, because I knew that in this form 
it would all be presented to the consideration of the Emperor 
himself, and that if there was any possibility of success, it would 
arise from his personal disposition, so congenial with every 
thing equitable and humane, and so peculiarly friendly to the 
United States. I have not yet received an answer to this note, 
but I know that on a representation of the circumstances set 
forth in it to the Emperor, he said he thought the vessels ought 
to be admitted. 

The obstacles to the admission of our vessels, especially 
at the port of Archangel, have not been confined to those 
coming from the Portuguese ports. For the purpose of 
carrying into execution the prohibitory ordinances, several 
persons in each of the ports have been appointed commis 
sioners for the examination of the papers of neutral vessels. 
They are styled the Commission of Neutral Navigation. 1 The 

1 Not in cypher. 



490 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

papers of all vessels upon their arrival are in the first instance 
submitted to their inspection. Like all organized public 
offices, they have only certain hours of transacting business, 
and in this country are subject to the interruptions of the 
numerous holidays of the church, as well as of Sundays. 
By their constitution consisting of several members, they 
naturally become in some respects a deliberative body. 
Having during the season of open navigation much business 
upon their hands, they generally take up the cases in the 
order in which they are brought before them. If in the ex 
amination of any papers, circumstances occur which any one 
of the commissioners deems suspicious, they give rise to dis 
cussions, to delays, and almost always a reference of the 
papers, and of the questions arising from them., to the deci 
sion of the Minister of Commerce at St. Petersburg. These 
questions so frequently happen that I am told of nearly three 
hundred vessels arrived at Archangel this season, less than 
one hundred had about the beginning of last month been 
admitted. 

The period during which navigation is practicable to and 
from Archangel seldom exceeds four months in the year. 
Should the vessels which have arrived, and are still arriving, 
be delayed much longer before they are admitted, they will 
be compelled to winter there, which for all of them will be 
very injurious, and for some almost equivalent to a total 
loss of the voyage. I had in my former conference with 
Count Romanzoff spoken to him on this subject; but in this 
last, the season being so much farther advanced, I pressed 
it upon him with as much urgency as I found he would bear 
without taking offense. I observed to him that the naviga 
tion from Archangel would probably be closed within a 
month or six weeks; that the length of the voyages, both in 
coming and returning, of American vessels, made a longer 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 491 

time necessary for them to remain in port than for others, and 
pleaded equitably for a peculiar attention of despatch in 
their behalf; that after their admission they must yet have 
time to dispose of the cargoes they had brought, and to pur 
chase cargoes for their return, none of which business could 
be transacted while they were left in suspense whether they 
should be finally admitted at all; that possibly Baron Camp- 
enhausen, with whom I had not the honor of being personally 
acquainted, and with whom, if I did know him, it might per 
haps be improper for me to have any conversation upon these 
subjects, might entertain suspicions in relation to many 
American vessels, owing to the extraordinary numbers of 
them which had arrived during the present season. But the 
fact was that a number far beyond that of any preceding 
year had really arrived, both here and at Archangel, coming 
directly from the United States, and destined to return 
directly thither; that I had anticipated this event, and, as he 
knew, had announced it to him as infallible, so long ago as 
last winter; that the causes of it were the obstructions to our 
commerce, which it experienced in almost every other quar 
ter; the suspension of it by our own laws in the preceding 
years; and, above all, the encouragement which our mer 
chants had derived from the peculiar favor which his Im 
perial Majesty had been pleased to manifest towards the 
United States. From my private advices, and from the 
complexion of the newspapers which I had received down to 
the middle of June, I knew that the exclusions which we 
were now subject to, in Prussia, Mecklenburg, and, as I ex 
pected to learn by to-morrow s post, in all the ports of Hoi- 
stein, were all expected in America; but many of our mer 
chants in all the sea-ports had said, Happen to us what will 
elsewhere, at least we are sure of being well received in 
Russia; that I hoped Baron Campenhausen would be made 



492 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

sensible of these circumstances, and of the essential impor 
tance to so many of my countrymen, that they should be 
immediately admitted. I added that this would be still 
more urgent for all those who might yet arrive before the 
close of the season; that I had received numerous letters, and 
from a variety of persons, all meeting with the same diffi 
culties, and every one thinking that there were particular 
circumstances in his case which would entitle him to special 
indulgences and exemptions. I was unwilling to trouble him 
with each of these cases separately, as I wished them all to 
participate in the same advantage, and was desirous of spar 
ing him the tediousness of particular details; that I had al 
ready had the honor of addressing to him a note, respecting 
the vessels which had arrived from Lisbon; that the super 
cargo of a vessel arrived at Archangel, from New York, had 
written to me to ask whether a special order for his admis 
sion could not be obtained, on account of his having brought 
despatches for me, and also to this government from Mr. 
Daschkoff. 

The Count said this was undoubtedly evidence that the 
vessel came from the United States; and he had in other in 
stances alleged it as such himself. But it could not be evi 
dence, either of the nature of the cargo, or that the vessel 
was not last from some port of Great Britain; that it would 
not be therefore a sufficient foundation for a special order. 

I then observed that in dwelling so earnestly upon the 
wish that I had expressed, I flattered myself I was promoting 
the interests of his Majesty s empire as much as those of my 
own country; that the number of American vessels which had 
come here, and the quantity of the Russian productions 
which they would take in return, were highly favorable to 
the agriculture and the manufactures of this country; that 
they gave encouragement to its industry, and contributed 



isio] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 493 

more than anything to support the course of its exchange. 
Such were the obvious effects of the vessels which had ar 
rived; but I thought it unnecessary to press this argument 
much, as I was persuaded his Excellency knew better than 
I did how strongly it was supported by the fact. 

The Count said he well knew that it was exactly so; that he 
had been hitherto the Minister of Commerce, but that a new 
arrangement had been made, by which all business of this 
nature was transferred to Baron Campenhausen; that he 
must do him the justice to say he was an officer of great 
activity, and dispatched business as fast as he could. But 
he was extremely apt to entertain suspicions; and possibly 
some delays might arise from this circumstance. He, the 
Count, was fully sensible of the weight and justice of the 
observations I had made to him. He would immediately 
make a minute of it in writing (which he did), and write to 
morrow morning to Baron Campenhausen, pressing the sub 
ject in a special manner upon his attention. 

I observed that my countrymen felt an extraordinary 
anxiety at these unusual detentions, from remarking their 
coincidence with the ordinances of Prussia, Mecklenburg, 
and Denmark excluding us from their ports, and from an 
apprehension that the same influence under which it was 
known that these orders had been issued might be exerted 
even here. 

He assured me in the most solemn manner that I might 
rely upon it there was no foundation for these apprehensions; 
that the Emperor s sentiments and intentions with regard 
to the United States remained unaltered, and disposed to 
give it all possible encouragement. The Count as I have al 
ready informed you had given me the same assurance in my 
last previous conference with him in regard to the Emperor s 
personal disposition, or to those of the Count himself. I have 



494 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

no reason to question their sincerity. But the French Ambas 
sador, as a minister of the first order, has by the diplomatic 
usages of the country direct and frequent access to the Emperor 
Alexander in person. There are subjects upon which he treats 
immediately with him, and without the intervention of the Count 
himself. The effect of the interviews between the Ambassador 
and the Emperor are perceived in the orders which afterwards 
go through the official departments. They are sometimes par 
amount at the deliberations of the Imperial Council. I have 
some reason to suppose that the Ambassador has suggested to the 
Emperor in terms stronger than the reality would justify, the 
abuses by which the English have endeavored and are endeavor 
ing to shelter their property under the American flag; and from 
a confidential source some expressions of the Emperor himself 
have been reported to me indicating both that such suggestions 
as I now allude to had been made to him and his determination 
not to yield to them. I cannot undertake to say that what has 
hitherto failed may not at a future day prove more successful. 

He asked me whether a favorable change had not taken 
place in the state of our relations with France. 

I said that France had partially opened her ports to the 
United States. 

He said he believed there was something still more recent, 
and that a sort of agreement had been entered into, between 
France and England, for the allowance of commerce in cer 
tain articles, by means of neutral vessels. 

I had not heard of this; but observed that in the midst of 
all these violent ill offices which France was doing to us, her 
government was making the most solemn asseverations of 
the best possible dispositions and the most friendly senti 
ments towards us; that I had within this week or fortnight 
received such assurances from the French Ambassador here, 
while at the same time the Mecklenburg and Danish orders 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 495 

for excluding our vessels from all their ports were coming 
out. The French government too had issued a declaration 
that the French consuls in the United States no longer de 
livered any certificates of origin, and therefore that all papers 
purporting to be of that description, produced by the masters 
of American vessels in the Baltic, must be forgeries. But 
nothing could be more false than this assertion. All the 
vessels coming from the United States brought certificates of 
origin given by the French consuls, and I had myself de 
livered to Mr. Lesseps 1 a letter from the French consul in 
Boston, 2 informing him that he had given such a certificate 
to the master of the vessel which sailed the latest of any 
which have yet arrived. In the order to exclude American 
vessels, which they had made the Duke of Mecklenburg sign, 
that Prince had committed himself to an assertion equally 
wide from the truth. He affirms that for a long time no 
colonial articles have been exported from the United States. 
This was sporting with the common sense of mankind in a 
manner almost unparalleled. 

The Count replied that it was indeed extraordinary; and 
with regard to the certificates of origin, he had remarked that 
the declaration asserted the French consuls had not delivered 
any "depuis quelque temps," an expression so vague that 
it might be a week or a year, and could warrant no inference 
to falsify any such papers yet produced. With regard to 
this system of restriction, the Count seemed to me more 
than ever convinced of its inefficacy, and prepared, at least 
in his own mind, to give it up. 

The day after this conference I received a message from 
Baron Campenhausen with information that the papers for 
the admission of several of the vessels which had been de- 

1 Jean-Baptiste-Barthelemy, baron de Lesseps (1766-1831).

496 THE WRITINGS OF [i 8 io 

tained, were already expedited; and that special orders had 
been sent to the Commission for Neutral Navigation at 
Archangel, to use the utmost possible despatch in the exam 
ination of the papers of American vessels for the future. 
While writing this letter I receive a note from him, informing 
me that his majesty the Emperor has ordered that the vessels 
from Lisbon, concerning which I had written to Count Ro- 
manzoff should be admitted. The decision involves a prin 
ciple which will apply to many other vessels in the same 
predicament, and affords a signal proof of the correctness 
with which the Chancellor assured me that the Emperor s 
dispositions towards the United States remain unaltered. 

/ have received indirectly intimation of the Count s desire to 
cement by a treaty of commerce the relations between the two 
countries. Unless the President has objections of which I am 
not aware , I would earnestly recommend that a full power and 
instructions for this purpose be sent me. The moment is emi 
nently favorable j and such an occasion once lost may not in as 
many years again recur. . . . 



TO THOMAS BOYLSTON ADAMS 

ST. PETERSBURG, 8 September, 1810. 

I have written to my son George, 1 who is coming now to 
an age which will call for all the care and all the zeal of a 
parent for his education. As you are now yourself the father 
of a boy, and I hope will be of more, you will more perfectly 
enter into my feelings on this subject, and the more readily 
indulge my opinions, although you may perhaps not always 
coincide with them. With regard to sedentary learning, the

i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 497 

languages, all the classical studies, and such personal ac 
complishments as are usually taught among us, I shall de 
pend upon the school and the college. I wish, indeed, he 
could have an opportunity to take lessons of drawing and of 
fencing, of both of which I learnt a little at his age, or soon 
after, and of which I always regret that I did not learn more. 
The first of these arts has not only the advantage of forming 
and improving the taste in all the fine arts, but there is no 
occupation of life to the purpose of which it may not be 
made eminently useful. The second is a very good exercise, 
and besides its tendency to invigorate the constitution, 
contributes to quicken the operations of the eye, and to give 
firmness and pliancy to those of the hand. I suppose, how 
ever, that for the present I must be content to let my boys 
wait for instructions of this kind, as you have probably no 
teachers of the sort in your neighborhood. One of the things 
which I wish to have them taught, and which no man can 
teach them better than you, is the use and management of 
firearms. This must undoubtedly be done with great cau 
tion, but it is customary among us, particularly when chil 
dren are under the direction of ladies, to withhold it too much 
and too long from boys. The accidents which happen among 
children arose more frequently from their ignorance, than 
from their misuse of weapons which they know to be danger 
ous. As you are a sportsman, I beg you occasionally from 
this time to take George out with you in your shooting ex 
cursions, teach him gradually the use of the musket, its con 
struction, and the necessity of prudence in handling it; let 
him also learn the use of pistols, and exercise him at firing at 
a mark. 

In general let him have as much relaxation and sport as 
becomes his age, but let him be encouraged in nothing deli 
cate or effeminate. Seize every possible occasion to give him 



49 8 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

hardihood, inure him to fatigue; let him if there be an op 
portunity begin to mount on horseback. If he goes into 
Boston to see a play, make him walk for it rather than ride 
in a carriage. Let him learn to skate this winter, and if he 
has not already begun, let him by all means learn to swim 
next summer. In everything of this kind I know there is 
danger, but it is a world of danger in which we live, and I 
want my boys to be familiarized as soon as possible with its 
face, that they may be the better warned and guarded 
against it. 

To his French, his speaking, and his handwriting, I must 
rely upon you to see that constant attention is paid. I have 
directed him to keep files of the letters which he receives, 
and told him you would have the goodness to show him how 
to put up and endorse letters in files. Much, very much, 
must be taught to children without seeming to teach them. 
A father should elicit from everything in nature instruction 
for his child, and you must in this respect be a father to mine. 

One of the kindest correspondents that I have had since 
I left home is Dr. Mitchill of New York. He writes me in his 
last letter that the Anthology has taken favorable notice cf 
my lectures, but though his letter is dated in May, he appears 
not to have seen the lectures at that time himself. His name 
was upon the list of persons to whom I desired you to send 
copies as presents in my name, which I hope you have not 
forgotten. And to that list I wish you to add the names of 
our sister Smith, and of Mr. Pope, the Senator from Ken 
tucky. 

Among the reasons why I am so much disappointed at 
being so long without hearing from you is the wish to know 
something more of the great revolution in the political as 
pect of New England and New York, a revolution which I 
was far from anticipating at my departure from the United

States, and still less expected after the last winter s patriotic 
resolutions. Absurd and pernicious as I knew the policy of 
the faction which ruled in the eastern section of the union 
to be, they had for two years been so much countenanced by 
the people that I had no hopes of seeing them so soon de 
serted by their majorities, or that they had so grossly mis 
calculated the effect of their measures upon the public senti 
ments. I hope, and from their selection of characters and 
the complexion of Governor Gerry s speech and the Houses 9 
answer to it I trust, that the rising party will secure their 
ascendancy by moderation and conciliatory councils. 



TO JOHN POPE 

ST. PETERSBURG, 10 September, 1810. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

I have seldom met in the course of my life with an event 
which has given me more pleasure, than the information 
which we have lately received of your marriage with a sister 
of my wife. To the esteem and respect which I had always 
entertained for your character ever since I had enjoyed the 
opportunity of becoming acquainted with you, I am happy 
to find added by this new relation between us that senti 
ment of regard and attachment which naturally arises from 
our mutual and like connection with the same family; and 
with regard to the object of your choice, having long taken 
an affectionate interest in her welfare, I most cordially par 
ticipated in the joy with which her friends have seen thus 
assured to her the prospect of as much happiness as our con 
dition in this world can comport, and which we believe she 
deserves. For you and for her I can form no better and no 
stronger wish than that through the course of a long and 



500 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

prosperous life you may both derive from this union as much 
of the felicity, and as little of the sorrows of human existence, 
as for upwards of thirteen years has fallen to my lot from 
my union with her sister. . . . 

It is now more than two years since I resigned my seat in 
the Senate of the United States, the occasion of which was, I 
believe, well known to you. A full third of the members 
has been changed since that time, and a letter from Mrs. 
Johnson to my wife intimates that you will also probably be 
soon, if you have not already been, removed from that body. 1 
As I presume the station which you are to assume instead 
of your seat in the Senate is more agreeable to you, I must 
acquiesce in your determination, which on my own account 
however I shall regret. I had flattered myself that during 
my own residence in Europe I could have enjoyed the bene 
fit of a confidential correspondence with you, which your 
situation in the Senate might have rendered useful to the 
public, as I am persuaded it would be to me. There are 
things which I could communicate to the President and 
Secretary of State in this manner, which it would not be 
prudent to write them directly, even by private letters; and 
on the other hand, I want information of the proceedings of 
Congress as affairs are transacting, and more particularly 
than can be gathered from newspapers. If, therefore, you 
remain in the Senate, I earnestly request your correspond 
ence, and the more frequent and circumstantial the better. 
It will also give me great pleasure to hear from you as often 
as you can make it convenient, if you should vacate your 
seat, and fix again your residence in Kentucky. 

If you continue in Congress, this letter I presume will find 
you in session, and the return of General Armstrong, 2 who 

1 John Pope (1770-1845), remained in the Senate until 1813. 

2 He left Paris, September 12.

may be expected to land in the United States just at the 
period when Congress will assemble, will furnish the govern 
ment with such information as may be necessary to direct 
the course of policy to be pursued in relation to our foreign 
affairs. Although from some letters and papers that I have 
received, it would seem that the measures of the last session 
did not give general satisfaction to the friends of the present 
administration at home, I believe that their general effect 
has been highly advantageous in Europe. The result cer 
tainly was to soften the dispositions both of the French and 
English governments. The non-intercourse, without much 
injuring either of them, had greatly irritated both, and the 
mortification, which Jackson s insolence and its chastise 
ment had reflected upon his government and nation, had 
further contributed to exasperate the English. The repeal 
or expiration of the non-intercourse happened at a fortunate 
moment for them. They were suffering a scarcity of grain 
and flour, of which they immediately received an abundant 
supply from America. Their fleet in the Baltic, which had 
been ordered not to suffer any vessels coming from ports 
from which the British flag was excluded to pass, imme 
diately afterwards and constantly since have allowed Amer 
ican vessels to come and go freely to and from the Baltic. 
France has done much more. She has accepted your proffer, 
and repealed the decrees of Berlin and Milan, upon condi 
tions, however, with which Great Britain appears to be in no 
haste to comply. Our national character instead of losing 
has certainly risen in the estimation of Europe, as well by 
the spirit and decision with which the door was shown to 
Mr. Jackson, as by the keen, bold and unanswerable letter 
of General Armstrong to the Duke of Cadore, of 10 March. 1 
I believe that the project which both France and England 

1 American State Papers, Foreign Relations, III. 381. 



502 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

did at one time entertain, of compelling us to take a part in 
their war and of suffering no neutrality, is abandoned on 
both sides. They will undoubtedly continue to harass our 
commerce with many vexations and oppressions, but in spite 
of them all I think that upon the whole it will flourish, and 
perhaps the insecurity and danger to which it will still be 
exposed will have a favorable tendency to check the pro 
pensity for our trading which has heretofore been observed 
among us, and employ a suitable proportion of our capital 
in the improvement of our agriculture and manufactures, the 
surest sources of our national independence. There is now 
every reason to hope that we shall escape being involved in 
this war, and if we do. the continuance of our national 
prosperity is infallible. 

I trust, therefore, that our government will adhere to that 
steady, moderate and impartial policy, which has hitherto 
carried us through one of the most critical periods in the 
history of the world. As an appendage either to Britain or 
France, the only character in which we should appear if we 
became parties to the war on either side, we should assume 
an appearance neither of dignity nor of power. All their 
dependencies on both sides are merely objects for the con 
tempt, or at least for the compassion, of one another and of 
the rest of mankind. Our situation is not only duly esti 
mated by ourselves, you may be assured that it is the envy 
of all Europe. The fatal friendships of England, and the 
grinding oppressions of France, ascend in secret or in open 
curses and execrations to Heaven from every corner of 
Europe. And even those who have no independence left 
of their own look with some consolation and applause upon 
the peaceful assertion of ours. 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 503 

TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
No. 24. [ROBERT SMITH] 

ST. PETERSBURG, 8/20 September, 1810. 
SIR: 

The capture by five Danish gun brigs of a fleet of forty- 
eight vessels, convoyed by one English brig on the I9th of 
July last, has been mentioned in one of my former letters. 
Of the captured vessels, seventeen or eighteen were Ameri 
cans and eight of them at least had sailed about one month 
before from Cronstadt for the United States. You will 
recollect that the present Danish privateering ordinance de 
clares all neutral vessels which shall have taken advantage 
of an English convoy in the Baltic or in the North Sea to be 
good prize. Against this regulation I remonstrated imme 
diately after I received the ordinance in a letter to Mr. Joy, 
of which I presume he made use in his communications with 
the government at Copenhagen, and of which he informs 
me he sent a copy to you. 

The British government at the opening of the Baltic 
navigation season declared the port of Elsineur in a state of 
blockade. The only conceivable object of this measure must 
have been to deprive the king of Denmark of the customary 
duties paid at the passage of the Sound. I know not by 
what other law of nations than that which pretends to the 
dominion of the seas or passage to half Europe can be 
stopped, for the purpose of cutting off a petty toll duty paid 
to an enemy. The British government have not indeed 
avowed this as their purpose in the declaration of blockade, 
and they have suffered some of the American vessels which 
they compelled to pass through the belt to stop at Nyborg 



50 4 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

and pay the Sound duties there. But I learn by a letter 
from Mr. Daniel Adgate, supercargo of the ship Helvetius of 
Philadelphia, which sailed from Cronstadt for that port in 
the beginning of the month of July, that on the loth of that 
month she was stopped by the British man-of-war African, 
off Moen Island, and the captain was peremptorily forbidden 
to proceed through the Sound, or to pay the Sound dues to 
Denmark. I presume that the American vessels which had 
preceded the Helvetius on their way out of the Baltic had 
met the same treatment; for I know that most, if not all, of 
the eight from Cronstadt, which have been carried into 
Christiansand at the time of their departure had determined 
not to go with an English convoy, if they could possibly get 
through without. Neither could they have had any motive 
for stopping at Gothenburg, unless from the necessity thus 
imposed upon them of going under convoy. 

It is not a little remarkable that after using this sort of 
compulsion to take our vessels under their protection, they 
should have left them so completely exposed that they may 
be said to have delivered them of their own accord into the 
hands of the Danes. I have seen in the public prints a letter 
from one of the captured captains which complains that 
after being separated from the great convoy on the i8th of 
July, off the Robsmont, which is on the Jutland shore, and 
entrusted to the care of one small cutter brig, they were 
made to take a course so directly northward as to bring them 
into the very jaws of danger, within six miles of the coast of 
Norway, and close upon Christiansand, the very spot where 
all the principal Danish force of Norway lay. Nor is it less 
deserving of notice that of the forty-eight captured vessels, 
not one is English. 

Since the intelligence of this event has been received here, 
I have had several conversations with the Baron de Blome, 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 505 

the Danish minister at this court, on the subject. I have 
urged to him the injustice of the regulation which makes a 
vessel and cargo liable to confiscation, though acknowledged 
to be neutral property, but merely for having occasionally 
been in company with an English convoy. And I have 
pressed yet more earnestly the extreme hardship of making 
such a regulation, so new and so questionable in its principle, 
bear upon vessels which had come into the Baltic before its 
promulgation, and to which therefore upon their return it 
operates as a retrospective law. 

At the same time as the British blockade of Elsineur had no 
other object than to cut off a profitable branch of revenue to 
Denmark, I suggested to the Baron as a subject for the consider 
ation of his government, whether some expedient might not be 
devised to secure the payment of the customary duties in future 
by the American vessels which may pass through, although they 
should not be allowed to go into Elsineur and might go in com 
pany with an English convoy. 1 This idea appeared to make 
some impression upon his mind, and he asked me to write in 
the form of a letter to him, the substance of what I wished 
to have represented to his government, which he promised 
me to transmit. He professed, as he has uniformly done, a 
disposition personally very friendly to me, and to the United 
States. Nor have I any reason to doubt its sincerity. Al 
though his duty to support as a public officer the course of policy 
adopted by his government, and the necessity which he cannot 
dissemble of cultivating the good will of France, lead him to use 
his influence here in a manner not altogether propitious to our 
interests or that of Russia, he is of all the foreign ministers at 
this court the most active and the best informed, though perhaps 
for that among other reasons, the most disliked. His pursuits 
since my arrival here have certainly been very far from mine, and 

1 Cypher. 



506 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

I may say in direct opposition to them; l but I have no reason 
to doubt the fairness of his mind, and I have known few, if 
any, public ministers upon whose word a firmer reliance 
might be had than upon his. 

Mr. George Joy s licenses, as I learn by a letter from him 
at Gothenburg, dated I5th of August, have not proved so 
efficacious for the protection of our vessels as he had ex 
pected. Indeed, from the explanation of their precise nature 
which he has given me in this last letter, the only effect they 
could have had would have been to protect vessels after 
passing at Elsineur from capture by privateers between 
that place and Copenhagen. While the British blockade of 
Elsineur continued they could be of little avail. It is indeed 
true that notwithstanding this blockade some of our vessels 
have been suffered to pass. For the orders of Admiral 
Saumarez to his subordinates, and perhaps the orders of the 
Admiralty to him, have varied several times in the course 
of the season. But the first American vessel which took at 
Gothenburg one of Mr. Joy s licenses, was stopped and 
turned back by the British before he could reach Elsineur. 

The repeal of the decrees of Berlin and Milan is upon con 
ditions which render it apparently of little effect. As yet I 
have not heard of a symptom indicating the intention of 
England to give up any of her blockading principles, nor 
even her Orders in Council of 1807, as subsequently modi 
fied. There is even in the French official journals an attempt 
to preserve the appearance as if nothing had taken place in 
the system of France. Possibly the change of system has 
not really been great. But the substitution of enormous duties 
for total prohibition will not so well suit the professed purpose 
of annihilating all commerce between Great Britain and the 
continent of Europe, and the sale of licenses by the Emperor 

1 Cypher. 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 507 

Napoleon for all sorts of vessels at a tonnage duty of sixty francs 
by the last, is neither disguised nor concealed. While he allows 
trade by special licenses it is not easy to see how he can deny to 
his neighbors and allies the benefit of granting licenses also; 
and although there may be a great part of Europe to whom he is 
rather in the habit of signifying his will than of urging persua 
sion, there are others who still consider his example as authority 
quite as good as his precept. I have long considered the conti 
nental system as little more than extortion wearing the mask of 
prohibition. The system is now at least so far changed that the 
mask is laid aside and extortion shows her natural face. . . .* 



TO WILLIAM PLUMER 

ST. PETERSBURG, 6 October, 1810. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

I received with the greatest pleasure a few days since your 
favor of the i8th of May, which is one of the latest I have re 
ceived from America. Although a great number of vessels 
have arrived in the Russian ports from the United States 
this summer, my friends in America appear not to have been 
aware of the frequent opportunities which occurred of writ 
ing by them. We have been tolerably well supplied with 
newspapers, but excepting your obliging letter, one or, two 
from Dr. Mitchill of New York, and as many from Mr. 
Joseph Hall of Boston, I have scarcely received a line from 
private sources out of my own family since I left them. I ask 
therefore with earnestness the continuance of your favors, 
which will be transmitted by the Secretary of State, or by 
Mr. Gray, if you will indorse them to him. 

The issue of the late New England elections had been in-

5o8 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

dicated to us early in the spring by the example of New 
Hampshire taking the lead of recovery from a delusion which 
for the two preceding years had given me great anxiety and 
apprehension. The infatuation of that political party in our 
country, with whom you and I had heretofore generally 
been accustomed to act and to think, their degeneracy from 
the just and honorable principles which alone could ever 
have attached us to them, the glaring absurdity and hy 
pocrisy of their professed veneration for the policy of Wash 
ington, while they were aiming a fatal blow at the Union, the 
great foundation of his political system, and while they were 
openly using for their purpose all the means which he had 
most solemnly deprecated, their blind and stupid servility 
to a British minority which was heaping insult upon outrage 
in this country, the profligacy with which they were endeav 
oring to make religion an engine of faction by the mounte 
bank trick of their solemn fasts, and by goading into the 
pulpit every ignorant priestly fanatic that they could employ 
as a tool, to pollute with the filth of personal malice and de 
traction the sacred desk of God, these were appearances and 
practices which I had witnessed for two years, accompanied 
with so much success, and against which I had during great 
part of the time seemed so ineffectually to have struggled, 
that the great change of public sentiment manifested by the 
elections of this year throughout New England was accom 
plished earlier than I had expected. The violence of last 
winter s Massachusetts and New York Jacksonite resolu 
tions, so congenial with measures of the former winter ses 
sions which had been countenanced by intervening popular 
elections, had led me to believe, that the public nerves were 
still in a disordered state and still mistaking the cause of their 
own disease. Though long experience had taught me, what 
you and I have often remarked together, how unskilful the 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 509 

federalists were in their attempt to adapt their measures to 
the state of the public pulse, yet as unlucky contingencies 
had thrown into their hands a majority which two years of 
madness had not sufficed for them to lose, I did suppose that 
they would not have disgraced themselves by such base 
prostrations before the insolence of a foreign emissary, and 
such shameless inveteracy against their own government, 
without being very sure that the agitated feelings of the 
people, at least in New England, still went along with them. 
I was, therefore, most agreeably disappointed in the issue of 
the elections. It has given me the cheering hope of internal 
tranquillity in our country, and of permanency to the Union, 
which for the two preceding years was certainly in the most 
imminent danger. 

You tell me, that I am often much reviled in certain news 
papers, and that the clumsy animals who still earn their sop 
by howling at me have not yet instinct enough to forbear 
coupling your name with mine in their yell of slander. As 
you are a historian I can give you a historical thread to con 
sider and meditate upon at leisure. In the month of July, 
1 787,* was published in the Boston Centinel, I believe the first 
piece of abuse of which I ever had the honor to be the object 
in a newspaper, and what think you was the occasion of the 
attack? It was because on taking my first degree at Harvard 
College I had delivered at Commencement an oration which 
happened to suit the public taste, and had obtained marks of 
approbation rather beyond the usual average. In the form 
of a critique upon the performance at Commencement a 
shaft dipped in venom was hurled at me on my first appear 
ance before the public view of my country. The author of 
this critique was a person who had himself been a much ad 
mired Commencement orator, but who thought it advisable 

1 See Vol. I. 347*., supra. 



5io THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

to balance the partialities of public indulgence in my favor 
by casting the heaviest of his weights into the opposite scale. 
The public did not sympathize with his criticism, nor did he 
ever think proper to own it. The editor of the Centinel was 
allowed and took it upon him to father a production, the 
features of which too loudly disclaimed the descent from 
him, as the Duke of Orleans when he took the name of Philip 
Egalite only stigmatized his mother by pretending to be the 
son of a coachman. 

I will not fatigue you with a tiresome detail of subsequent 
occurrences derived from this one. It may suffice to say that 
this anecdote will give you the key to all the ribaldry which 
from that day to this has appeared in the Centinel pointed at 
me. The temper which first dictated that effusion has some 
times been suppressed, but never subdued, and I have too 
long known the general character of human nature, and the 
particular hearts of the individuals, to expect that it will 
ever be appeased. The two years which preceded my de 
parture from America had furnished ample materials for the 
exercise of that temper. But they had brought my own tem 
per to the trial of a higher test. By adhering to my prin 
ciples I had been deserted and sacrificed by my friends. I 
knew that the ground that I had taken was not to be shaken 
under me by friend or foe. But the example of such men as 
yourself and Mr. Gray, gave a countenance and sanction 
to my conduct which at the most critical moment gave me 
the greatest satisfaction, and made me take a pride instead 
of feeling pain at the overflowings of malice and envy, 
which were so copiously streaming down upon me. Hatred 
has a keen eye, but its feelings impose upon its vision. They 
whose purpose it is to blacken me could not more effectually 
defeat their own object, than by shedding a portion of the 
same invective upon you. 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 511 

I now please myself with the hope, that you and your 
associates in our public affairs will now preserve by modera 
tion and wisdom the ascendancy which you have obtained. 
But if our country has exhibited a new example of the in 
stability of popular sentiments, the giddy habitation of the 
vulgar heart, it has still more forcibly proved to me the 
difficulty, as well as the duty, of maintaining oneself free 
from the shackles of dependance upon any party. And yet 
as the government of a state, and still more that of the na 
tion, must consist of a systematic combination of measures, 
it is certainly necessary and even indispensable, that in 
dividual members of a party should on most occasions, per 
haps on all, sacrifice their individual opinions to those of the 
majority, whenever this acquiescence does not involve a 
dereliction of principle. 

It was natural enough that the ardent spirits who felt 
indignant at the outrages still continued of Britain and 
France upon our commerce, should be dissatisfied at the 
issue of the last session of Congress. But you, who consider 
things coolly, have very justly judged, that the measures 
adopted were far better than others which, indicating more 
resentment, might not have had more real energy. The non- 
intercourse, ineffectual as a weapon to hurt either of the of 
fenders, had operated only to exasperate both. Its repeal 
has, at least, been taken by both in good part, and has been 
followed by corresponding relaxations on their side. France, 
indeed, has availed herself of it with the most address, by 
seizing upon the occasion to abandon the whole system of 
anti-neutrality if England will do the same. England will 
not give up entirely, but will probably yield to some further 
modifications, which may leave an extensive and profitable 
field open to neutral trade. We have escaped, providentially 
escaped the scourge of war with either of them, and you 



512 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

may be assured that in the estimation of all Europe our 
national character is continually rising on the scale of power, 
and of moderation and wisdom, without losing any in that 
of genuine spirit. 

The politics of Europe are still extremely complicated, and 
the prospects of the future are gloomy. The new relations 
between France and Austria are not yet fully unfolded to the 
world. Their harmony with Russia is yet uninterrupted, 
though circumstances have occurred which might occasion 
coolness between them. Russia is now carrying her victo 
rious arms into the heart of Turkey, but her exhausted 
finances are clamorous for peace. The object of my mission 
has, I believe, hitherto been completely accomplished. But 
your cunning politicians, who knew so well and told the 
people so positively what that object was, like Mr. Fingal, 
" saw what was not to be seen." If you will compare the con 
duct of Russia toward American commerce with that of all 
her neighbors, not even excepting Sweden, you will easily 
perceive the object of my mission, and thus far its success. 
I am, etc. 

TO ABIGAIL ADAMS 

ST. PETERSBURG, 2/14 October, 1810. 

Your elections for the House of Representatives in Con 
gress will now soon discover, whether the voice of the people 
in New England continues to favor the general policy pur 
sued by the national government or not. The measures of 
the last session of Congress appear to have given some dis 
satisfaction to the friends of the administration, but their 
effect in Europe has been good. Neither Mr. Macon s bill, 
as it went from the House of Representatives, nor the 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 513 

amended bill, as passed by the Senate, would have produced 
a result so advantageous in the measures of France and 
England, as the law which actually passed both houses. Our 
countrymen must remember that manifestation of spirit is 
not always exertion of energy, and that to withdraw the one 
for the other is a very dangerous error in politics. 

General Armstrong has left Paris to embark for America, 
and I presume is by this time far advanced on his passage 
home. He carries with him, it is said, some new modifica 
tions of the system of French decrees, favorable to the com 
merce of the United States. His letter of 10 March, to the 
French Minister of Foreign Affairs, is universally admired 
here, and has done great credit to our country by supporting 
its estimation and maintaining its dignity in the face of 
Europe, as well as of America. But while France is holding 
to us now the language of friendship and conciliation, she 
is playing us all the sly tricks in her power elsewhere. 

I was very glad to receive the number of the Anthology 
containing the critique upon my lectures. 1 I had more than 

1 "Mr. [Samuel Cooper] Thacher . . . then read a most delightful long review 
of J. Q. Adams s Lectures, which was received by all with decided approbation; 
but the first paragraph and the concluding sentence of the last was objected to, 
on account of its mention of politicks. A discussion ensued, on the propriety of 
retaining these passages, when Mr. [Joseph Stevens] Buckminster and Mr. [William 
Smith] Shaw were for striking out, and Mr. [William] Tudor [Jr.] and Mr. [James] 
Savage for retaining. A vote was taken, when there appeared three for each side, 
and the Vice President [John Thornton Kirkland] gave it for retaining." Journal 
of the Anthology Society (Howe), 225. Thacher wrote, and without doubt repre 
sented the general view: "We have indeed no wish to disguise our sentiments on 
the political career of Mr. Adams. We have, on this subject, no sympathy with him 
whatever. We see and lament that the orb of his political glory has become dark 
Irrevocably dark, total eclipse: 
Without all hope of day. Samson Agonistes" 

He excused this expression, "lest the praise we may be bound in justice to bestow, 
should lose its value by being supposed to proceed from political friends." And at 
the close of the review the writer lamented that Adams had turned from the walks

once heard of it, and my curiosity had naturally been ex 
cited. The author may say what he will about his political 
antipathy to me, I take him to have had, even while he was 
disclaiming my friendship, a SNEAKING kindness for me. As 
a critic he would doubtless object to this expression as 
coarse, and in an "excessively bad taste." But on the other 
[hand,] it is the only word suited to the thing. He may take 
comfort that he is not alone. I had great numbers of these 
secret friends among my dear fellow townsmen of Boston, 
who in defiance of their own consciences were joining in 
the hue and cry, and making themselves the tools of my real 
enemies. If the day should ever come when they shall think 
there is anything to be got by my friendship, I have no doubt 
they will be as officious in boasting of their attachment to me, 
as they have been and yet are in disavowing it. I have had 
so many of these amiable friends, that I can almost say in the 
language of Shakespeare "I have kept of them tame." It 
is not magnanimous and certainly not wise to quarrel with 
human nature for being weak. That a man should be de 
serted by his friends in the time of trial is so uniform an ex 
perience in the history of mankind, that I never had the 
folly to suppose that my case would prove an exception to it. 
Admiral Berkeley brought on my time of trial, the only real 
one that has happened to me in the course of my life, and 
most completely was I deserted by my friends I mean in 
Boston and in the State legislature. I can never be suffi 
ciently grateful to Providence that my father and my brother 

of literature, had abandoned "the laurels which he might have gained without a 
rival, to gather a barren and withering chaplet of political renown." He applied 
to him the lines of Goldsmith, as a man 

whose genius is such 

We scarcely can praise it or blame it too much; 
Who, born for the universe, narrows his mind, 
And to party gives up what was meant for mankind. 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 515 

did not join in this general desertion. There were exceptions 
in the town of Boston, which I trust I shall never forget. In 
the legislature not one. But as to political friends, the loss of 
one was the gain of another quite as trusty and quite as 
honest. The Junto-men, whose pretended friendship had 
never been anything but disguised hatred, I considered it 
fortunate to have stripped of their masks, and at open 
enmity. But these half-faced fellowships, these prudent 
politicians who would have been my friends if they had 
dared, but whose credits at the banks, advertising custom, 
or corporation favor, depended upon their disclaiming me, 
have made their friendship fit as easy upon me as it did upon 
themselves. 

The principal faults which I have to find with the Anthol 
ogy critique is for its excessive praise. Heaven knows that 
I was not formed of materials insensible to the praise of my 
fellowmen, but I cannot relish praise from a quarter which I 
do not esteem, and I cannot esteem the man who can de 
grade himself by such servile sacrifices to popular prejudices, 
as the Anthology critic has gone out of his way to make in 
reviewing a merely literary work. If he had no sympathy 
with my politics, it is at his own peril. If he believes what 
he says of my high character, great talents and private vir 
tues, what call was there upon him for his declaration of war 
against my politics? Was it to soothe the subscribers to the 
Anthology, and atone for the commendation of an heretic? 
Yes, this motive is sufficiently discovered and almost openly 
avowed, and in my scale of morality it is a motive so despic 
able, that I would not give a straw for all the commendation 
that such a panegyrist could bestow. His censure, having 
relation to the work, is partly just, and partly erroneous. 
For a book of instruction the lectures are in a style too ora 
torical, or if you please too declamatory. I purposely in- 



516 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

dulged myself and my hearers in some excess of this kind, for 
the sake of riveting their attention to the subject, and because 
I know that superfluous luxuriance might easily be pruned, 
and that barrenness could never be made to flourish. This 
was the very reason which made me reluctant at the pre 
mature publication of the lectures, for I knew that I must 
abide by the blame which they would bear for this original 
sin. My recollection of Caesar s oration for Archias, as he 
states, was inaccurate, and that was one of the passages 
which I should have altered, if I had had only time to read 
them over, and after the call for publication, and before they 
were published. Incorrect metaphors, as he says, abound 
in every part of the book. I do not set so high a value upon 
perfect correctness in the use of figures as Dr. Blair or Mr. 
Addison did, and their correctness is much more perfect in 
theory than in practice. Blair has shown by minute analysis 
that Addison s "Pleasures of the Imagination," and Swift s 
"Proposal for improving the English Language," abound in 
every part of them in incorrect figures, and I think I have 
shown that Mr. Blair has no distinct idea of the difference 
between figurative and literal language, insomuch that he 
quotes two of the most figurative passages in all Virgil as 
examples of pure simplicity without figures. Correctness is 
always cold and tame; and although I never write incor 
rectly on purpose, I suppose a multitude of incorrectnesses 
to escape me, and sometimes let them pass even after detect 
ing them myself. These are crumbs for small critics to feed 
upon. The passage attempting to illustrate the different 
modes of reasoning by ratiocination and induction is, perhaps, 
as he objects, still somewhat obscure. I think I understand 
it myself, but that lecture was one of those with which I was 
most dissatisfied, and it is probably one of the worst in the 
book. I could easily defend most of the other passages with 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 517 

which he finds fault, but as a whole the work must defend 
itself or fall. If it should ever go to a second edition, it can 
doubtless be made more correct, but it must live or die by 
the soundness or defects of its vital parts, and they must 
stand the test of sterner judges than the critic of the An 
thology. 

To return to my politics. I find that of all the American 
newspapers the Boston Centinel is that which most frequently 
gives me token of remembrance in my absence. Among 
other obliging notices I find the editor has informed the 
world, "how ill calculated our townsman is for the splendid 
and intriguing Court of St. Petersburg." As a commentary 
to show you how accurately his correspondents have been 
acquainted with my condition here, and how justly they 
have represented it, I must give you in the original lan 
guage, which my father or my brother will translate for you, 
an extract from a dispatch of the Chancellor of the Russian 
Empire to Mr. Daschkoff, which that gentleman has com 
municated to the President of the United States: "L accueil 
qu a fait 1 Empereur a M. Adams a du le convaincre que, si 
sa destination etait agreable a sa Majeste, le choix de sa 
personne n y contribuait pas moins. Recommendable par 
le nom qu il porte, ainsi que par ses qualites personnelles, 
ses titres ont ete justement apprecies par sa Majeste Im- 
periale. Je ne doute pas, Monsieur, que son Excellence le 
President des Etats Unis n en ressente une satisfaction per- 
sonelle de 1 attention de sa Majeste Imperiale a son choix." 

I intreat you, however, that this may not go out of our own 
family. I see how ungraciously it comes from myself, and I 
should not have given it even to you, but for the compliment 
which it contains to my father, which he and you ought to 
know, and which to my heart gives to the whole testimonial 
its most precious value. This dispatch was dated 10/22 



5 i8 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

November, 1809, just about the time when the correspondent 
of the Centinel was making the discovery "how insignificant 
a figure our townsman" was making at St. Petersburg. 
From that day to this the Emperor has treated me with the 
same kindness and attentions, and, what is much more im 
portant, he still gives a welcome reception to my country 
men, while all his neighbors have excluded them from their 
ports. I remain, etc. 



FROM JAMES MADISON 

Private. Washington, October 16, 1810. 

DEAR SIR: 

Previous to my return to this city, I received a letter from Mrs. 
Adams, your highly respectable mother, communicating your 
anxiety to leave a situation rendered insupportable by the ruinous 
expenses found to be inseparable from it, and taking it for granted 
that you had written or would write to the Secretary of State to 
the same effect. The answer to her was, that as it was not the 
intention of the executive to expose you to unreasonable sacrifices, 
it could not withhold a permission to retire from them, and that 
you would be so informed from the Department of State. You 
will accordingly receive a letter of leave, and a blank commission, 
providing for the care of our affairs till a successor may be ap 
pointed. As no communication of your wishes, however, has yet 
been received from yourself, I cannot but hope that the peculiar 
urgency manifested in the letter of Mrs. Adams was rather hers, 
than yours; or that you have found the means of reconciling your 
self to a continuance in your station. Besides that confidence in 
the value of your services which led to the call upon them, there 
are considerations which you will readily appreciate, bearing 
against a sudden return from a short mission, the occasion for 
which has been made the subject of so much lucubration. Among 
them is the difficulty of shielding the step against unfavorable 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 519 

conjectures as to its cause in the mind of the Emperor; and the 
evil might become the greater from the possibility of a protracted 
intermission, if not entire discontinuance, of the representation of 
the United States at St. Petersburg, corresponding with the grade 
of the Russian minister here. It will for this reason be particularly 
expedient, in case you should make immediate use of the docu 
ment sent you, to spare no pains in guarding against a miscon 
struction of your departure, and in preparing the Russian govern 
ment for a delay in filling the vacancy, which may be unavoidable, 
notwithstanding the purpose of preventing it. As far as assurances 
of unabated friendship here can be of aid to you, they may be 
given with every emphasis which the sincerity of these sentiments 
can warrant. 

I will add that whilst I do not disguise my wish that the con 
tinuance of your valuable services may be found not inconsistent 
with your other and undeniable duties, I cannot, on the other 
hand, wish that the latter should be sacrificed beyond a reasonable 
measure; and within that measure, I am entirely persuaded that 
your patriotism will cheerfully make the sacrifice. 

Accept my sincere respects and friendly wishes, 

JAMES MADISON. 

TO WILLIAM GRAY 

ST. PETERSBURG, 8/20 October, 1810. 
DEAR SIR: 

Almost all the profitable mercantile business of St. Peters 
burg is commission business. The merchants therefore are 
all commission merchants. The first object of their ambition 
is to obtain consignments, and their great address consists 
in making the most of them. The American business has 
heretofore been monopolized by a few houses, and in some 
unless all the information that I have obtained 



520 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

here on this matter is erroneous, has fallen into bad hands. 
The practices by which some houses are said to have en 
riched themselves upon the plunder (for it deserves no better 
name) of their correspondents in America, are numerous and 
have not always escaped detection. Until within these two 
years the amount of American business was comparatively 
small, and few of the Americans who came here knew how 
their affairs were really transacted. As the houses who en 
grossed all the consignments were much connected with one 
another, you will easily perceive how they could sink the 
price currents of cargoes to be sold, and raise the market of 
those to be purchased, more according to the level of their 
own interests than to those of their consigning friends. The 
principal houses purchase on their own accounts, when the 
prices are at the lowest ebb, immense provisions of all the 
articles of export. The instant an American vessel is re 
ported to have arrived at Cronstadt, down go the prices of 
whatever she brings, and up start those of the Russian ex 
ports. Then the consignee furnishes his friend with a cargo 
from his own stores at the increased price, or gives higher 
than the current price in market for part of the supply, in 
order to charge the remainder at the same price from his 
own warehouses. These are among the fairest and most 
honest artifices of the trade. But I have been told of simu 
lated sales which some consignees make to themselves; of 
pretended payments of hush money at the custom house, 
charged sometimes to the amount of many thousand rubles 
under the name of extra charges, but never paid in reality, 
only pocketed by the consignee; of twenty thousand rubles 
offered to a supercargo for the favor of transacting his owner s 
business; of purchases made with the funds of a correspond 
ent and for him by his order, but refused to be delivered six 
months after, because in the interval a great advance had 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 521 

taken place in the price of the article purchased; of ostensible 
accounts of purchase, sale and charges, totally different from 
the real transactions at the expense of the consignee, and a 
list of and-so-forths all in the same style. If your business 
here in future should bear any comparison in amount with 
what it has been the present year, I feel perfectly assured 
that you would find it highly for your interest to have an 
agent of your own to superintend the transactions of all your 
business, and that it would require a person not only of in 
corruptible integrity, but active, intelligent and conversant 
with the ways and means of the merchants at this place. 



TO THOMAS BOYLSTON ADAMS 

ST. PETERSBURG, 11/23 October, 1810. 
MY DEAR BROTHER: 

I have always rejoiced at the mode which chance much 
more than design gave me of a correspondence from Amer 
ica, but there is no escaping one s destiny, and I have been 
abused in the newspapers, both for putting the nation to the 
enormous expense of a frigate to transport my precious carcase 
across the ocean, and for landing at Cronstadt from a mer 
chant vessel loaded with sugar and coffee. How deeply ven 
omous must be the feelings, and how scanty must be the food 
for them to subsist upon, which can feed upon such sub 
stances as these. Perhaps one half the ministers of the 
United States, who have come to Europe since the declara 
tion of Independence, have come in frigates, and never a 
syllable was lisped at the expense. The other half have 
come in merchant vessels, and nobody ever heard how they 
landed, or of what the cargoes of the ships were composed. 



522 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

May such always be the reproaches of my enemies, and may 
they never have anything worse to object against me. 

True it is, that while the insignificance of the American 
minister s appearance is the subject of sarcasm, the theme is 
copious, and would be ludicrous in proportion to the details 
into which a person acquainted with his style of living here 
and that of other ministers might enter. Compare him for 
instance with a French Ambassador who expends nearly 
three hundred thousand dollars, and you may judge how he 
must show. Compare him with the ministers of petty 
principalities whose names are scarcely known to you, and 
the lowest of whose salaries are equivalent to twenty thou 
sand dollars a year, and you may rely upon it he does not 
shine. He cannot associate upon terms of equality either 
with the other foreign ministers, or with the court nobility 
of the country, or even with the merchants who are making 
enormous fortunes by American consignments of "sugar and 
coffee " and to complete the picture it must be added, that 
from all these three classes of society he has received the 
most pointed and most oppressive attentions, oppressive I 
call them, for the utter impossibility with his means of 
meeting them by the return which they so justly deserve. 
But he knows that to indulge but for a moment that honest 
pride which is uneasy until it has reciprocated obligations of 
hospitality, would be total ruin to him and his family. He 
therefore limits his expenditures to his allowance from his 
country, shines as much as he can in those circles of society 
with whose splendor he cannot vie, and lives almost entirely 
retired within the bosom of his own family. This you may 
say is not very diplomatic, but it is absolutely necessary as 
you say "to steer clear of the breakers" 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 523 

TO ABIGAIL ADAMS 

ST. PETERSBURG, 25 October, 1810. 
MY DEAR MOTHER: 

Russia and England being at war, the commercial inter 
course between them is of course forbidden, and neither 
English vessels nor English subjects are allowed to come into 
the Russian territories. You already know that one of the 
expedients by which the English have attempted to evade 
these prohibitions was by presenting themselves as Ameri 
cans, with forged passports and ship s papers. The Russian 
government admit universally every American recognized 
as such by the American minister or consul. This business, 
since I have been here, continues as it was before to be trans 
acted by Mr. Harris, the consul, who never fails, however, 
to consult me, and take my opinion in every case susceptible 
of a question. I had not been here a week before I was asked 
to authenticate a paper purporting to be a passport of the 
Mayor of New York, and an eminent merchant of this city 
sent me in writing his guarantee, that the man named in the 
passport was a native citizen of the United States. The pass 
port was forged in London by a Jew named Van Sander, who 
had kept there a shop for neutral papers for several years, 
and the man named in it was a Liverpool trader, who, had 
never set his foot in the United States. You very naturally 
perceive that I not only refused the authentication desired 
of me, but that I did not entirely suppress a sentiment of 
indignation at the imposition that was attempted to be 
practised upon me by the guarantor. 

Within a fortnight afterwards two ships entered with 
registers of the same Van Sander fabrication. They were 
detected by Mr. Harris, who laid the papers before me, and 



S2 4 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

who duly informed the Russian government that they were 
forged. The vessels with their cargoes were confiscated and 
their papers delivered to Mr. Harris, who has sent them to 
the Department of State. In this he acted entirely with 
my countenance and approbation, which under a weight of 
mercantile influence existing here in favor of these frauds was 
undoubtedly useful, if not necessary to him. I certainly 
did let it be understood by all the merchants of St. Peters 
burg and of the other Russian ports, that forged papers pre 
tended to be American should find neither connivance nor 
mercy from me, whenever they should come to my knowl 
edge, although this determination so explicitly manifested 
did not recommend me to the favor of Englishmen in this 
part of the world not even to that of the merchants of St. 
Petersburg. I do sincerely believe that had it not been for it, 
the real American flag would long before this have been ex 
cluded from the ports of Russia, as it has been from those of 
Denmark and Prussia. 

I have heard by an American gentleman, who was in Lon 
don at the time when the news of these disasters to the Amer 
icans of the Van Sander stamp arrived there, the consterna 
tion which they occasioned among the gang of banditti who 
had been driving that trade, and the bitterness of their gall 
against the meddling American minister. But I have had 
no more forged passports with guarantees sent to me to be 
authenticated, and only two or three more of Mr. Van 
Sander s registers have appeared in the Russian ports during 
the present year. They have met the same fate with their 
predecessors. But the story that I examined all the papers 
of vessels myself, or that I ever meddled with them, unless 
at the request of Mr. Harris, of the Russian government, or 
of the persons to whom the papers belong, is a mere fabrica 
tion totally destitute of truth. 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 525 

My real offence, therefore, has been in contributing to the 
exclusion of persons, vessels and cargoes really English, but 
coming with the forged signatures and seals of the public 
officers of my country. And the editors of American news 
papers, who have copied from their English fellow laborers 
columns of abuse for this conduct, pretend that the charge 
of British influence over them is a calumny. 

In speaking of the American influence here in favor of 
these frauds it may be proper to explain myself further. The 
merchants of St. Petersburg are almost all foreigners; great 
numbers of them are English, or connected with English 
houses. Their business is almost exclusively commission 
business. They universally detest this war with England, 
and long for the restoration of the commercial intercourse 
with that country. They want the trade, and they care not 
under what flag or what papers it comes and goes. The 
American flag and American papers would have been the 
most convenient of all their shelters, and under the liberal 
confidence with which the Russian government admitted 
every vessel and person coming from friendly countries and 
recognized by the American minister or consuls as Americans, 
if our countenance could have been obtained, instead of 
fifty or sixty vessels from Teneriffe which have come to 
Russia for confiscation under all sorts of papers excepting 
American, we might have seen five hundred direct from the 
London market, both of merchandize and of papers. The 
inevitable and just consequence of which would have been, 
that the true Americans would have been confounded with 
the false, and all of them involved in one general proscrip 
tion. 



526 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

TO THOMAS BOYLSTON ADAMS 

ST. PETERSBURG, 27 October, 1810. 
MY DEAR BROTHER: 

On the principle of returning a separate answer or reply 
to every letter that I receive from you, I remain yet one in 
arrears to you, since in my last I acknowledged the receipt 
of two, dated 27 March and 7 May. 

With the last dated, but first received of those, came the 
number of the Anthology containing the most learned critique 
upon my lectures. It reminded me of a famous speech of 
which I have heard, said to have been delivered in the Massa 
chusetts Convention for deciding upon the federal consti 
tution, a speech in which the orator, after enumerating the 
principal objections which were then made against that 
national compact, concluded by saying "for these reasons, 
Mr. President, I shall vote for the adoption of this Consti 
tution." But I have written to my mother my opinions of 
this notable performance, and that was taking quite as 
much notice of it as it deserved. A thousand such reviews 
will do my book neither good nor harm. But our giants of 
literature are waiting to see what the English, and especially 
what the Scottish reviewers, will say, to know whether the 
work is good for anything or not, and that most unlucky 
episode about Lord Holland which crept so unaccountably 
into the Silesian letters, I know will secure me another 
scratch from the titillating fingers of Edinburgh. Lord Hol 
land it seems is himself one of the lashes of that cat of nine 
tails the Edinburgh Review, and that circumstance explained 
the vindictive rancor with which they scourged those let 
ters. 1 

*The article, by Francis Horner, appeared in the Edinburgh Review, V. 180. 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 527 

Their fortune has certainly far exceeded their pretensions, 
for besides the English edition of them they were dealt out 
again in driblets by half a dozen English magazines, and they 
have had the honor of being translated into French and 
German, and in both of those languages have been about as 
much abused as they were in English. I presume that the 
lectures will at least be spared in other languages than their 
own. 

Ever since I have been this time in Europe packets of news 
papers have come to me by almost every vessel that has 
arrived from Boston, made up and forwarded to me by 
Young and Minns, the editors of the Palladium. This oblig 
ing attention, which has often furnished me the most recent 
intelligence from America, has been the more unexpected 
and indeed surprising to me, as I find that in their own paper 
they spare me as little as before I left home, and, like the 
other federal prints, readily circulate any scurrility upon me 
from what quarter soever it may come. At any rate I am 
obliged to Messrs. Young and Minns for the trouble they 
have taken to send me the papers, and must ask you to 
thank them in my name for their kindness. I would send 
them some newspapers in return, if there were any published 
here that they could read, or that could reach them in time 
to give them any news. But I wish them to be assured that 
if I have no immediate opportunity to return their favor, I 
am not the less sensible of it. 

We had yesterday the first levee ^ or as they call it here 
diplomatic circle, since the return of the Imperial family 
from their summer residence in the country. I presented 
Mr. Jones at court. 1 It was the Empress mother s birth 
day, and in the evening there was a French opera perform- 

1 T. K. Jones, Adams, Memoirs, October 9, 1810. 



528 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

ance at the theatre of the Hermitage. All the ministers of 
the corps diplomatique received tickets of admission to this 
performance, which was a thing without example in the 
present reign. Mrs. Adams received also a ticket, and as 
there is now no other foreign minister s lady at St. Peters 
burg, that she might [not] be alone, the Emperor expressly 
ordered that a ticket should also be sent to her sister Cath 
erine, although she has not been presented at court. The 
Hermitage theatre is in the Palace which bears that name, 
and the French company of players occasionally perform 
there by the Emperor s command. The tickets of admission 
are distributed as he directs, and are confined to his own court 
and to ambassadors. This was the only instance in which 
ministers of the second order have ever received an invitation 
there. You are sufficiently acquainted with monarchical 
governments to know how every human being that surrounds 
a sovereign, from a prime minister to a scullion, catches the 
tone of the master in the treatment of persons, and while I 
and my family shall receive such marks of attention as these, 
trifling as they are in themselves, you may make yourself 
quite easy about my qualifications for the splendid and 
intriguing court of Russia, and even about the figure which 
we made on our landing at Cronstadt. I have, indeed, in 
the course of the summer received proofs far otherwise im 
portant than these, of the Emperor s friendly disposition 
towards the United States, and if I have not, as I certainly 
have not, the means of turning to the greatest possible 
benefit of my country these favorable sentiments, both to 
wards my nation and myself, the fault is not mine. I have 
yet a trying winter to go through, and I have reason to ex 
pect that the next summer will prove no less so; but at this 
moment you may be assured that the only object of my con 
cern is, that circumstances which I cannot control may oc- 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 529 

casion us to lose some of the favor in which we now stand. 
This may be unavoidable. I had seen before the receipt of 
your letter the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United 
States in the case of Fletcher and Peck, which had given me 
great pleasure. I am so little used to hear anything like an 
acknowledgment from those whom I have favored, that the 
gratification of my feelings is the greater when I find it 
given. I was therefore delighted to learn from you that Mr. 
Peck attributes the success of that cause to my exertions at 
the preceding session of the court. I do not make this gen 
eral observation by way of complaint. I settled it as a prin 
ciple at a very early period of my life, and expressed it in one 
of my performances at an exhibition while at college, that 
we must serve our fellowmen from a nobler motive than the 
expectation of their gratitude in return, and that we must 
never take it as a disappointment when we experience the 
failure of that gratitude. I hope I have always acted up to 
this principle, and when I have met with grateful returns, I 
have always considered it as so much of my positive enjoy 
ment gained which was not to have been expected. 

My dear boys are never out of my thoughts. Your ac 
count of John s 1 rapid improvement in learning to read was 
a banquet to my soul. There are so many things that I 
want them to learn that I can scarcely wait with proper 
patience for the time when they ought to be taught them. 
I presume they are now with you, and am sure they will have 
all the kind care and attention both of yourself and of your 
wife. I have already expressed to you my anxiety with 
regard to George s handwriting and his French. I wish him 
to begin immediately to write letters, and to be required to 
write them entirely from his own head, though he should 
have some assistance to correct the spelling. Letter writing

is but learnt by practice, and upon every letter that he writes 
or receives you can lead him by a few short remarks to dis 
cern the true characters of the epistolary style. But while 
he is made to pursue his sedentary studies with all the as 
siduity which he can bestow upon them, I wish him also to 
be inured to bodily fatigues and even hardships. Let him 
have no effeminate indulgencies, no cockering, no encour 
agement to the anticipations of a life of indolence, and ease, 
and enjoyment. Let his sports and amusements even be 
of the hardy kind, which partake as much of labor as of 
pleasure. Teach him courage and discretion blended to 
gether in the same lessons. How much I ask you to do for 
him, and how easy it is to ask! The best of all possible educa 
tions I know is but a lottery, and without a corresponding 
disposition in the child, all that you can do for him is but 
labor lost. Let us do, however, all that we can and leave the 
result to Providence. I am, etc. 



TO EZEKIEL BACON 

ST. PETERSBURG, 3 November, 1810. 
MY DEAR SIR: 

Ever since the 4th of July, 1809, I have had upon file a 
letter from you of the preceding 29th of June, with the in 
tention of making to it the reply to which on many accounts 
it was justly entitled. It was one of the earliest notices which 
I received of my exile, as you termed it, to this place, and the 
subjects to which it relates, amidst the rapid changes so 
peculiar to these times in the political world, have not yet 
altogether lost their interest. 

The motives for the mission to St. Petersburg were, to 
gether with almost everything else, misrepresented by one 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 531 

of our political parties, and not very accurately estimated by 
the other. They were founded in the considerable and in 
creasing commercial relations between the two countries, 
and in the peculiarly friendly sentiments of the present 
sovereign of Russia towards the United States. This mis 
sion, and its reciprocation by a Russian minister, whom 
before the receipt of this letter I presume you will have seen 
at Washington, have probably contributed to that difference 
which has marked the conduct of Russia towards the trade 
of the United States, from that which has been exhibited 
by the other northern states of Europe, and by all the gov 
ernments under the direct influence of France. There is not 
only a most remarkable coincidence between the commercial 
policy of Russia and of the United States, but at the present 
Ttime a full conviction of that coincidency in the minds of 
\those who govern this country. My only concern is that we 
ll not avail ourselves so much as we might of the op 
portunity afforded us, to settle some permanent principles, 
which might survive the changes of mind to which all gov 
ernments are subject, and especially those under the domin 
ion of one absolute sovereign. 

Your political struggles of the last winter were such as 
must have been anticipated from the moment that the Brit 
ish government disavowed the arrangement which had been 
concluded by Mr. Erskine. The English party in our country 
seems to have ventured beyond its depth to such a length, 
that the people even in New England would no longer follow 
them. I say even in New England, because south of that, 
or at least of New York, the national feeling had always 
been too decided to admit of a contest with foreign influence, 
and the people had never encouraged the avowal of a bias 
towards England, which our eastern sages have lately gloried 
in, as if they really thought it a virtue. So long as the people 



532 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

[hold] by their steadiness to themselves, it will perhaps be a 
public benefit that those, who ought to be always in the 
minority, should be so ready to proclaim their own shame. 

Notwithstanding all the vexations and depredations to 
which our commerce during the present year has been ex 
posed, I presume it will upon the whole prove profitable, 
even to our merchants. The issue which has been opened to 
the principal productions of our agriculture has been im 
mense, and the farmers and planters suffer comparatively 
little from the injustice of foreign nations and princes. Our 
government I trust will adhere inflexibly to the system of 
neutrality, which henceforth I expect will not be difficult. 
That alone will preserve our independence amidst all the 
European revolutions. The war against colonial articles of 
merchandise will, in all probability, be continued at least 
another year, and at present, having assumed the form of 
heavy duties, it may be more troublesome than it has been 
in the shape of prohibition, or even of confiscation. But they 
will eventually make their way through that, as they have 
through the others. It appears not improbable that one 
ultimate result of the present war will be the total dissolution 
of the European colonial system. France has lost all her 
colonies. Holland no longer exists. Spain has every pros 
pect of being irrevocably severed from all her transatlantic 
possessions, and Portugal has already by the removal of 
her royal family to Brazil made way for a second independent 
power in the western hemisphere. England alone remains 
with her colonies, but they will be of little use to her in that 
relation, when the two American continents, and all the im 
portant islands of the West Indies, will be opened to the 
trade of all the world. It is impossible that all this should be 
restored at the peace. 

The north of Europe has, during the present year, been 



iSio] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 533 

the scene of some important events, the most remarkable of 
which have occurred in Sweden. While a French general 
has been elected as the successor to the throne of that king 
dom, its former sovereign has been a wanderer in Switzerland 
and Germany, until he came to Russia, and about a fort 
night since embarked at Riga on board an English armed 
vessel for England. The principal forces of Russia have 
been engaged in an active and bloody war with the Turks 
and Persians. To extend the Russian frontier to the shores 
of the Danube, two Turkish provinces have been incor 
porated with the Russian empire, and several strong for 
tresses on the south side of the Danube have been taken. A 
new order for recruiting the armies has been issued requiring 
a levy of three men upon every five hundred throughout 
the Empire. It will raise an addition of about one hundred 
thousand men to the present military force of the country. 

I suppose you are in Massachusetts, now in the midst of 
your elections for the next Congress, and I hope that our 
country will still have the benefit of your services. At all 
events I take the liberty to remind you of the obliging prom 
ise contained in the letter to which I now reply, that I should 
enjoy the advantage of your correspondence. The proceed 
ings of Congress during the session, and the prospects of 
our country and prevailing sentiments of the people during 
the recess, will furnish subjects always entertaining to me, 
when you find them suitable to your own leisure and con 
venience; and if from these polar climes I can give you 
nothing of equal value in return, I can at least assure you a 
punctual correspondent in your very sincere friend, etc. 1

SIR: 

The last American vessel which arrived at Cronstadt this 
season, was the Lion, Captain Bainbridge. The same vessel, 
together with one belonging to Boston, sailed for the United 
States on the first of this month, and they were the last that 
can go before the next year. The river Neva is already full 
of ice, the bridges between the several parts of the city 
divided by the river are taken away and in two or three days 
more will be replaced by the natural bridge of the season. 
From this time until next June I shall have it in my power 
to write to you only by occasional and indirect convey 
ances. . . . 

saying that the Emperor had granted licenses only to American vessels I do not 
know. With the duties of the tariff it is very little consequence under what flag the 
goods are imported. A few single vessels may arrive, pay those duties, and make 
still a profit upon the voyage, but in a very short time it must result in a struggle 
between fraud and force, between contraband and confiscation." To Joseph Pit- 
cairn, November i, 1810. Ms. 

"The revocation of the decrees of Berlin and of Milan, and the Emperor Na 
poleon s declaration of love for the Americans, have not been followed by measures 
remarkably characteristic of that sentiment. The exclusion of all American vessels 
from the ports of Denmark, Mecklenburg and Prussia, of which the governments 
of those countries were the passive and unwilling instruments, was precisely con 
temporaneous with the honied words of the Duke of Cadore in his letter to General 
Armstrong of 5 August. Of the efforts which have been made to produce a similar 
order here I have given you regular and repeated information. These efforts are 
still continued, and by the prohibitions against the importation of certain articles, and 
the aggravations of duties upon others which I think will be adopted before the com 
mencement of the next year s navigation, I apprehend they will be partially successful" 
To the Secretary of State, November 6, 1810. Ms.

The port of Gothenburg is indeed now the only point of 
steady and regular communication between all the northern 
part of the continent of Europe and England. It has also 
been the resort of a great number of American vessels. 
Many of the Americans who have been there have mentioned 
it as a circumstance not without considerable inconvenience 
that there is no consul there from the United States, the 
consul who formerly resided there having died two or three 
years ago. The consular business, as they represent it, has 
been transacted by a Mr. Dickson, an Englishman, who was 
his clerk or partner, and into whose hands his official papers 
and consular seal fell after his decease. His connections ac 
cording to their accounts are much more with England than 
with the United States; and if in assuming the exercise of 
the consular powers after the death of the consul, he has not 
used them for improper purposes, he has at least not detected 
and exposed the abuse of our nag, which in some cases has 
come to his knowledge. It may not only be of very material 
importance that a native American should be appointed as 
consul at Gothenburg, but I take this occasion to suggest 
that our consular system in general deserves the very par 
ticular attention of the government. Among other things 
it would be advisable that they should all be expressly in 
structed to oppose by all proper means the impositions 
which are so constantly attempted to be practiced under 
false American colors and papers. I have heard of a num 
ber of American vessels which have been sold with all their 
papers, and which are now sailing about the world, and 
producing their American registers whenever it suits them 
to wear the American flag, although they are owned wholly 
in England and by English merchants. The Manhattan of 
New York, and the Two Friends of Charlestown have been 
mentioned to me by name, as being in that predicament. 



536 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

The papers of some of the vessels condemned in the Danish 
Admiralty Courts have been after their condemnation taken 
from the files of the court, and sold to anybody that would 
purchase them. One vessel with papers thus purchased 
came last summer to Cronstadt, of which Mr. Harris has 
given you information. She was not however admitted to 
an entry. The papers of the ship Commerce of Philadelphia, 
condemned by the court of Christiania in Norway, were sold 
and resold in open market at Christiansand until as I am 
told Mr. Jackson obtained possession of them. If the war 
should continue much longer, and abuses of this kind are 
tolerated and connived at by persons acting or assuming to 
act under the authority of the United States, it may be 
taken for a certainty that our own commerce will eventually 
bear the penalty. 

As our consular system (setting aside the consuls to the 
Barbary powers) allows the officer no pecuniary compensa 
tion, it would not be required that he should abstain from 
engaging himself in commercial transactions; but while the 
consuls are merchants, and while commerce of all kinds is 
in that cramped and unnatural state which marks the present 
times, you will immediately perceive the allurements and 
the opportunities, which the American consuls throughout 
Europe will have to favor and even to partake of illicit trade. 

They have I believe a discretionary power of appointing 
vice consuls and agents at the ports where they reside and 
in all the ports within the limits allotted them. The mer 
chants of the country to promote private interests of their 
own are often very solicitous, and sometimes emulous of 
these subordinate appointments, and I understood it had 
been a practice among our consuls to sell them either for a 
settled sum annually, or by stipulating for a portion of the 
profits both of consular business and of commercial consign- 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 537 

ments which the vice consul or agent thus appointed re 
ceives. They do not generally conceive themselves bound to 
any obligation of residence at the place for which they are 
appointed, and whenever their own affairs call them away 
they absent themselves, sometimes for years, sometimes 
even without any intention of returning, and leave in their 
stead a vice consul or agent well disposed to make the con 
sulate profitable to himself, but having very little connection 
with or concern about the United States. 

It is very desirable that these things should be reduced 
to some more regular and permanent principles, and I beg 
leave to recommend it to the consideration of the govern 
ment, whether it would not be proper to provide by law; 
I. That the consular commissions should be limited in time - 
say to four years, but renewable either by the mere issuing of 
a new commission or by a new appointment like the marshals 
of the judicial districts. 2. That the power of the consuls to 
appoint vice consuls or consular agents, be subject to the 
confirmation or approbation of the President of the United 
States; and that with respect to the persons upon whom 
they may confer such appointments, they should receive 
standing instructions from the President or the Department 
of State. 

3. That some rule of residence at the place to which they 
are appointed should be laid down for them. It is not nec 
essary that this rule should be extremely rigorous; but for 
any absence for more than three months, I should think 
they ought to be required to obtain the permission of the 
President; and to have good reasons to assign for it. 4. That 
in case of the decease of consuls there should be prescribed 
some course of proceeding for the security of their official 
papers, of the documents in their offices, and of their public 
seals. 



538 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

5. That it should be made their duty to correspond with 
the Department of State and of the Treasury more frequently 
than has heretofore been the usage. I speak of this however 
principally from conjecture. 

Perhaps some supplementary measures may be found 
necessary to guard against the English forgeries of American 
ships papers. As you have had several of these forgeries 
before you, I presume it has already become a subject of 
consideration to the President and therefore shall only permit 
myself to observe, that the prompt and decisive discrimina 
tion between the genuine and spurious American papers has 
been the great, if not the only effectual cause of the unre 
stricted admission of our vessels into the Russian ports, while 
they have been excluded from almost all others in the north 
of Europe. . . . 

TO ABIGAIL ADAMS 

ST. PETERSBURG, 16/28 November, 1810. 
MY DEAR MOTHER: 

I received a few days ago, and since I wrote you last, a 
letter from Captain William Welsh, dated at Liebau, a Rus 
sian port in the Baltic, to which I suppose he came on rinding 
that all American vessels were excluded from the port to 
which he was originally destined. He inclosed to me at the 
same time your kind letter of 25th July. In the obstructed 
state of navigation in the Baltic I have scarcely ever re 
ceived a letter from America in less than four months from 
its date, and from the acknowledgments of my correspond 
ents I find that our letters have been still longer in reaching 
them. I am, however, continually reminded by the receipt 
of letters from you of your punctuality and attention as a 
correspondent. I hear of letters as late as the 6th of Sep- 



JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 539 

tember, but excepting yours I have myself received none 
later than June. 

We had already heard of the death of President Webber 
at the time of Mr. Jones s arrival. But it is much to be re 
gretted, as from the present state and complexion of affairs 
the prospect is not bright of seeing his place supplied by so 
good a man. My own affections as well as my judgment 
would incline in favor of Mr. Ware. 1 But I think very highly 
of the talents and of the temper of Dr. Kirkland. My great 
est apprehension from him would be the very circumstances 
which perhaps will contribute most to his election. I mean 
his political connections. It has become a fashionable doc 
trine of late years that the College should be turned into a 
political engine, a doctrine which I altogether disapprove, 
and I am very much afraid that the late alteration in the 
constitution of the college government arose from party 
motives. Of this alteration, not having seen it in its full 
extent, I cannot speak positively, but by advertisements in 
the newspapers I should infer that the connection between 
the legislature of the Commonwealth and the University 
has been formally dissolved. The Senate and Council 
formerly constituted a part of the Board of Overseers, and 
the Congregational clergymen of the six neighboring towns 
were the other part. Instead of which there are now chosen 
fifteen laymen. I should conceive that a liberal and com 
prehensive spirit would seek to make the most ancient in 
stitution for the education of youth in our country venerable 
in the eyes of the world, and that by thus attaching the pub 
lic authority of the State and the ministers of religion by 
ties of duty to the interests and welfare of the College, one 
of the most natural and happy expedients for that purpose

had been devised. From the wise and profound policy of 
this idea, to that of fifteen laymen chosen by a caucus, there 
is in my mind a lamentable falling off, and there must be 
some extraordinary benefit of which I am not aware attached 
to the administration of those fifteen laymen, to compensate 
for the loss which the University must sustain, by discharg 
ing the legislative and executive authorities of the State 
from all superintendence over its affairs, and by removing 
the clergy thus completely from that superintendence. . . . 
The River Neva has been frozen over about a fortnight, 
and has about five months longer to remain in the same con 
dition. We have already had several days nearly as cold as 
our most rigorous days in America. Within the house, how 
ever, we feel nothing of this severity. Double windows, 
double doors and stove fires keep our apartments at the exact 
temperature that we choose to have them. It is the fashion 
of the country to keep a thermometer in almost every room 
and chamber of the house, and at the same time another 
fastened to a window outside. The scale in most common use 
is that of Reaumur; Fahrenheit s is not used at all. Gener 
ally dining rooms and parlors are kept at 15 degrees of 
warmth (65 degrees of Fahrenheit), bedchambers at about 
12, or 60 of Fahrenheit s. It is considered as a general rule 
that for healthiness the bedchamber must be kept cooler 
than any other. There is a stove in every chamber, and in 
the houses laid out for comfort or luxury one in the entry. 
In large halls there are usually two, and sometimes four. A 
fire is made once a day in every stove, but when the weather 
is very mild, some of the stoves are suffered to pass unheated 
every other day. The wood is precisely of the same kind as 
the eastern wood so much used at Boston. The stove is 
heated in the manner of an oven, and when the wood is con 
sumed to a coal without flame, the chimney passage is cov- 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 541 

ered over with an iron cap like the lid of a pot. The walls 
of the houses are about three feet thick. The external win 
dows hang upon hinges in the form of folding doors. The 
glass is very large, the panes in most common use are 25 or 
26 inches long and 19 wide. The internal window consists 
of six such squares in a single frame, which is put up in 
September, and taken down in May, and when put up, the 
crevices all round the sash are stuffed with tow and paper is 
pasted entirely round the borders. But for the sake of 
ventilation one corresponding square of both the windows is 
made like a door on separate hinges, and may be opened at 
pleasure. The sash of this square is therefore larger than 
that of the rest, and gives an irregular and awkward ap 
pearance to the windows. For that reason perhaps it has 
acquired the name of a was-ist-das, meaning in German 
what s that. In many houses there are windows of two single 
panes, each six or seven feet long and twenty inches wide, 
and in hinged frames folding together like doors. 

There are two remarkable differences between the severe 
winter weather of this country and that of our own. The 
first is that here there are no violent snow storms. It snows 
an hour or two almost every day in October, November 
and December, and continues through the winter occasion 
ally to snow in the same manner. But scarcely ever does it 
snow for five or six hours together, and a fall of snow of a 
foot deep at one time is, I believe, without example. The 
snow here drifts comparatively very little; once fallen it lies 
the whole winter and receiving so frequently a fresh powder 
ing it settles and cakes into a substance between ice and snow, 
which by the month of March gets to be three or four feet 
thick. But it lays almost entirely on a level until the break 
ing up of the frost in March or April. The streets of St. 
Petersburg are then scarcely passable. The second pecu- 



542 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

liarity, which mitigates the rigor of this climate, is that the 
extremest colds are always accompanied with a clear sky, 
and little or no wind. If with an atmosphere of 30 degrees of 
Reaumur below o, which is 67 degrees of Fahrenheit below 
the freezing point, there were at the same time a wind like 
our northwest gales, I believe human nature could not exist 
under it. 

We are all well. As this sentence is worth a volume in 
every letter which we receive from home, so I trust it is the 
most acceptable thing that we can write to you in return. I 
know not how or when I shall have an opportunity to send 
you this, but I write it now to have it in readiness by the 
first opportunity that may offer. They sometimes present 
themselves suddenly, and I have then barely time to prepare 
my public letters. 

The last political event which has excited attention was 
the Emperor Napoleon s decree to burn all the English man 
ufactures upon which his custom house or his military troops 
can lay their hands. 1 The state of commerce throughout 

1 "At the time when the Emperor Napoleon conditionally repealed the decrees 
of Berlin and Milan, he was inclined to peace, and if the British ministers had been 
wise, they would have taken step for step. They chose to set up a cry of victory, 
and to return a fair advance of liberality with an evasion, as it regarded America, 
and an insult to France. This threw him into a new rage, and he has returned 
with aggravated rigor to his continental system. Whether he will eventually in 
jure England by it is yet very doubtful; but he will ruin great multitudes of people 
by it upon this continent, and he will, as he has done, prey upon the American com 
merce, wherever he can lay his hands upon it." To Abigail Adams, 5/17 Decem 
ber, 1910. Ms. 

"The English government not having thought fit to revoke their Orders in Coun 
cil after the conditional revocation by France of the decrees of Berlin and Milan, 
the French Emperor is determined to make a new effort to cut off the commerce 
between Great Britain and the continent of Europe. On the igth of October he 
issued a decree that all English manufactured goods existing in warehouses or cus 
tom houses, in France, Holland, Spain, Italy, Naples, the Illyrian provinces, or 
wherever French troops could reach the land, should be seized and burnt. The

Europe continues to be excessively distressed, and will prob 
ably be much more so before it will experience any relief. 
Our countrymen still rush in crowds into every port where 
they can obtain access, and into many where they meet 
nothing but seizure and confiscation. There are twenty or 
twenty-five vessels which were coming here, at a season 
when no mortal European dares venture into the Gulf of 
Finland; only one of them reached Cronstadt, and that while 
the river was freezing. The rest have entered the Reval, 
Riga, and other ports of the Baltic. Some have not yet been 
heard of. I hope however that none of them have been 
lost. I am, etc.

ST. PETERSBURG, i December, 1810. 
SIR: 

Since the close of the navigation at this place more than 
twenty American vessels bound to Cronstadt and last from 
Gothenburg have arrived at the ports of Liebau, Baltic- 
port, Riga and Reval, into which they were compelled to 

excessive duties upon colonial merchandise fixed by his decree of 5 August have 
been prescribed by all the governments under his influence; and as this will probably 
not frighten the English into compliance with his wishes, by the abandonment 
of their system, you must be prepared for another and more aggravated series of 
vexations upon commerce the next year. In the present aspect of affairs, if I can 
take the liberty of advising you, it will be not to trust your property with any of 
the ports under his dominion, by which I mean every country where he dictates 
decrees, as well as those where he issues them. Among them I particularly include 
Denmark and Prussia. Of Sweden I cannot positively speak. The French official 
gazettes already scold about the admission of English vessels at Gothenburg, and 
there is now a French general settled at Stockholm, as the successor to the throne 
of Sweden." To William Gray, November 16, 1810. Ms. 



544 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

enter by the impossibility of proceeding farther up the Gulf 
of Finland. One only, a vessel in ballast, found its way as 
far as Cronstadt. These vessels formed a part of a convoy 
of five or six hundred sail which left Gothenburg on the 7th 
of October, and entered the Baltic by the passage of the 
Belt. On their arrival at the several ports which I have men 
tioned their papers were transmitted to the Commission for 
Neutral Navigation at St. Petersburg, and several of those 
which first arrived were admitted without difficulty. But 
as their numbers increased a suspicion appears to have arisen 
either that they were English vessels, or from English ports, 
and a subsequent order was issued to suspend the admis 
sion of those which had not been admitted, and the unload 
ing of the cargoes of those which had, until further orders, 
and to send the papers to St. Petersburg for further exam 
ination. This order having excited some uneasiness and 
alarm among the persons interested in these vessels and 
cargoes, some of them applied to me for interference in their 
behalf, and last evening I had an interview with the Chan 
cellor, Count Romanzoff, on the subject. He said he sup 
posed the occasion of the suspicion which had arisen was that 
those vessels belonged to the great convoy from Gothenburg 
which had been so long signalized by the Emperor Napoleon. 
I assured him that I was fully satisfied that the vessels of 
which a list had been furnished me were bonafide Americans, 
and that their papers were correct; that by several of them I 
had received letters from my friends in the United States; 
that the captain of one and the supercargoes of others were 
personally known to me; that the owners of almost all of 
them were also known to me, either by reputation or as re 
spectable citizens of the United States, and that I had such 
information respecting them all, as left no doubt in my mind 
that they were real Americans. The Count intimated that 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 545 

under these circumstances the obstacles to their admission 
would easily be removed, and requested me to write him a 
line without official formality containing the statement I had 
verbally made to him, and promised to lay it before the Em 
peror. I have accordingly this day written him the letter, 
of which I enclose herewith a translation. 

The Count then entered into general conversation and asked 
me to give him candidly my opinion with regard to the two meas 
ures lately adopted by the Emperor Napoleon: 1st, the tariff oj 
duties upon colonial articles of $th August; and 2ly, the auto 
da fe (this was the Count s own expression), meaning the decrees 
of IQ October, for burning all the English merchandise, upon the 
European continent within the reach of the French troops. He 
wished me to say what I thought would be the general operation 
of these measures upon England on the one hand, and upon the 
continent on the other. 1 

I told him that in speculating upon the probable effects of 
the tariff, it seemed to me that the first would be a mo 
mentary and considerable replenishment of the public coffers, 
by a measure in the highest degree oppressive upon individ 
ual merchants. That a second would be a great diminution 
of consumption of the articles thus overburthened with 
taxation. That a third would be a tax of unexampled sever 
ity upon the people, the mass of consumers, levied upon 
many articles of primary necessity. And a fourth would be 
a great increase of contraband trade, which I did not believe 
the Emperor Napoleon, with all his power, could prevent. 
That with regard to the burning decree, it would distress and 
perhaps ruin great numbers of merchants upon the continent, 
to whom a large proportion of the merchandise thus con 
sumed will unquestionably belong, and will shock as it has 
shocked the moral feelings of mankind, who can never be 

1 Cypher. 



546 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

made to relish the policy of wantonly destroying objects of 
labor and ingenuity contributing, some to the subsistence, 
and all to the comfort and enjoyment of human life. They 
will naturally say, seize and confiscate the property of your 
enemy if you will, but destruction is the policy of a Vandal. 
That as to the operation of either or both these measures 
upon England, I did not believe it would be so great as the 
Emperor Napoleon appeared to expect, and that I believed he 
had a very exaggerated idea in general of the effect which 
could be produced by such measures upon the councils of 
the British government. No doubt many merchants would 
be ruined; many commercial houses would become bank 
rupt, but the proportion of failures to the mass of existing 
trade would be small, and it would not be felt by the nation 
to an extent that would either alarm or dispirit them into 
petition for peace. Indeed it might very probably happen 
that the decree for burning goods of English manufacture 
would prove useful to the manufacturers themselves by in 
creasing the demand for the articles, as it was a well known 
practice of the Dutch formerly in India to burn great quan 
tities of the spices of the country, to raise the price of what 
remained. That the operation of these measures on the 
continent would be at least as distressing as it could be in 
England. It would ruin as many individuals, occasion as 
many bankruptcies, and would fall upon people whose com 
mercial resources were far inferior to those of the merchants 
in England. That there was a sympathy of commercial in 
terest which was paramount to all political hostility. The 
merchants of two countries between whom there existed 
commercial relations were in fact only the brokers between 
the buyers and sellers, they had a common interest, and it 
was impossible to break a great merchant in London without 
breaking at the same time merchants in Hamburg, Amster- 



iSiol JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 547 

dam, St. Petersburg and even Paris. That at this moment 
the distress of the merchants at all these places was well 
known to him. It was extreme. The failures were numer 
ous; they would soon be still more so. They were the result 
of these measures. And yet the people were everywhere 
obliged to endure these things without daring even to ask 
for peace. In England the case was the same. No minister 
in that country would dare to make peace until it should be 
called for by the voice of the people in petitions from the 
counties and cities. It was thus that the peace had been 
forced upon the government after the American war. It 
was thus that the peace of Amiens had been procured. Be 
fore the French invasion of Spain, the spirit of petitioning 
for peace had begun strongly to show itself in several counties 
of England, but now not a whisper of that kind was heard. 
// the British ministry had dreaded the effect of these measures 
they would immediately have proposed an abandonment of the 
Berlin and Milan decrees, and secured it by revoking their 
Orders in Council. This, however, they had not chosen to do, 
and they must have foreseen and been prepared for whatever 
the power of the Emperor Napoleon could accomplish in conse 
quence of their adhering to their system. 

The Count listened with attention to these observations, but 
he neither expressed his own assent to these opinions, nor his 
dissent from them, so unreservedly as he has done on some, former 
occasions of a similar kind. I gave him my opinion the more 
unreservedly, because I knew the French government had very 
recently demanded the adoption of the same measures here. This 
demand also extended, as I have heretofore informed you, to the 
exclusion of all American vessels, which has been decisively re 
fused. The dispositions and inclinations of the Emperor and 
of Count Romanzoff with regard to the commercial relations with 
the United States still remain firm and unaltered; but beyond 



54 8 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

all doubt our commerce here will be next year much more re 
stricted and much less favored than it has been at present. It is 
perfectly obvious that the Emperor Napoleon s continental sys 
tem can have no considerable effect against England while any 
one of the northern European states remains exempt from the 
effect of his measures; nor while American vessels laden with 
colonial articles obtain access to the Continent without being 
subjected to his tariff. The auto da fe if performed here, would 
do us neither good nor harm; but I think it will not be tried. 
But the tariff, I strongly apprehend, and most especially upon 
the articles of sugar and coffee. . . .

SIR: 

Last Thursday week being the festival of St. Catherine, 
there was a diplomatic circle or court held at the imperial

the letter, which I had written to him, respecting the admis 
sion of the American vessels which have arrived at several 
Russian ports in the Baltic and Gulf of Finland, since the 
close of the navigation here prevented their arrival at Cron- 
stadt, to which they were destined. I sent you a translation 
of this letter with my last number. 

The Count told me, that he had already laid my letter 
before the Emperor, who had permitted him to refer it to 
the Minister of Commerce. But no more of the vessels have 
yet been admitted. The Commission for Neutral Naviga 
tion have received orders to suspend the examination of the 
papers, and the Emperor has ordered the subject to be re-

ferrcd to the decision of the Imperial Council. In the mean 
time an article in the Paris Moniteur has already pronounced 
that none of the vessels belonging to the great convoy from 
Gothenburg will be admitted into Russia. 1 

At the time when the French Minister of Foreign Affairs 
transmitted to General Armstrong, the conditional revoca 
tion of the decrees of Berlin and Milan, there were various 
indications of an approximation towards peace between 
France and England. The furious passions, which on both 
sides swell the tempest of this war, were obviously beginning 
to subside. Count Metternich, the Prime Minister of the 
Austrian Empire had been from the time of the Emperor 
Napoleon s marriage at Paris for the express purpose of pro 
moting a negotiation for peace, and through him propositions 
to that effect had been transmitted between France and 
England. An English negotiator, Mr. McKenzie, had during 
the same time been residing at Morlaix, ostensibly to effect 
an exchange of prisoners; and precisely at the same time, 
when the Duke de Cadore sent his letter to General Arm 
strong, it was announced that the cartel for the exchange 
was concluded. At that moment, I believe, had the British 
ministry been inclined, they might have obtained a peace 
upon more advantageous terms than will ever come within 
their reach again. Instead of improving, however, this fav 
orable opportunity, they filled their newspapers with 
triumphant exultations at the change of system proposed by 
France, and the Marquess Wellesley, recognizing the promise 
so often made by the British government to renounce the 
system which had been professed to be merely retaliatory 
upon those decrees, whenever they should be removed, post 
poned further the performance of this engagement in a 
manner, to say the least, more calculated to raise the resent-

ment than to conciliate a further relaxation of hostility on 
the part of France. This proceeding appears to have pro 
duced in the mind of the French Emperor a determination 
to make a last effort to cut off effectually the commercial 
communication between Great Britain and the continent of 
Europe. Just at that time began to assemble in Wingo 
Roads, just below Gothenburg, a convoy of vessels destined 
to the Baltic, which was continually increasing until it 
amounted to more than six hundred sail at the beginning of 
October. It was soon signalized by the Emperor Napoleon 
(to use the expression of Count Romanzoff). An article in 
the Moniteur, early in the month of September, complained, 
that this intercourse with England permitted by the way of 
Gothenburg was incompatible with the engagements, which 
Sweden had contracted in the treaty of peace with France. 
An official article in the Swedish gazette answered, that 
Sweden had faithfully performed the engagement of her 
treaty with France, and that no English vessels were ad 
mitted into her ports; but that the Roads below Gothenburg 
were not so commanded by fortifications on the land as to 
make it possible to prevent English vessels from assembling 
there. 

Count Metternich remained at Paris until October, but 
found it impossible to devise any basis for a negotiation, 
on which France and England would agree. England could 
not treat without her allies of Spain and Portugal, and yet 
in the negotiation for exchange of prisoners refused to re 
deem the Spaniards and Portuguese taken acting in concert 
with her armies: France would not hear of any Spanish or 
Portuguese negotiators for peace, and yet insisted that the 
Spanish and Portuguese prisoners, should be taken in ex 
change for Frenchmen, prisoners in England, upon an equal 
footing with the English themselves. All the negotiations 



JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 551 

were broken off and Count Metternich returned to Vienna, 
having accomplished nothing but a treaty for removing a 
sequester upon certain landed estates, which had been seized 
with the territories of the Prince of the Rhenish Confedera 
tion, at the commencement of the last war between France 
and Austria. 

Then came the decree of 19 October for seizing and burn 
ing all the merchandize of English produce or manufacture 
within the reach of French troops in any part of the European 
continent. The same measure was demanded not only of 
the Princes of the Rhenish League, but of the sovereigns who 
still retain their independence, of Austria, and of Russia, 
both of which have declined complying with this demand. 

General Bernadotte, now become Prince Royal of Sv/eden, 
was travelling in great splendor and magnificence from 
Paris to Stockholm. In his correspondence with the king 
and in a variety of speeches and answers to addresses while 
he was on the road, and after his arrival, he was manifesting 
his gratitude, his devotion to his new country, and his 
prodigality of life for her glory and defence. On the 2nd of 
November he made his public and solemn entry at Stock 
holm, was adopted by the king, as his son, and assumed the 
name of Charles John. A few days afterwards the French 
minister at Stockholm, Alquier, presented a note, demand 
ing the seizure and confiscation of all English manufactures 
of colonial articles, the prohibition of their importation into 
Sweden for the future under any flag whatever, and an im 
mediate declaration of war against England. And he added, 
that unless a satisfactory answer was given to their demands 
within five days, he was directed to ask for his passports and 
return home. At the same time, the Swedish government 
were informed by a courier from Baron Lagesbjelke, 1 their 

1 Lagelbielke, in Vandal, II. 467. 



552 THE WRITINGS OF [1810 

minister at Paris, that the Emperor Napoleon had told him, 
that if Sweden did not comply with his demands, he would 
not only seize upon Swedish Pomerania, about which he ob 
served they did not seem to care much, but that he would 
bring both Russia and Denmark upon her at once. Sweden, 
therefore, has declared war against England; has prohibited 
both the importation and exportation of all English and 
colonial articles of merchandize under any flag, and has 
ordered those already imported since the 24th of last April 
to be seized and placed at the king s disposal according to 
the laws of the kingdom. For Sweden having a constitution, 
and calling itself a free state, the power of arbitrary confis 
cation was not in the king. 

The refusal of Russia to seize and confiscate, or to shut her 
ports against future importations of colonial articles was com 
municated to the French Ambassador on the first of this month, 
and he immediately dispatched it by a courier to his government. 
The determination of the Emperor, of Count Romanwff, and of 
the whole Imperial Council is said to be fixed and unalterable, 
and I hope will prove so at the test to which I think it will be 
brought; but if a message comes, like that to Sweden, which is 
not impossible, the necessity of commerce and the real regard 
for the United States, which is undissembled and unimpaired, 
may yield to the first principle of the Russian policy at this 
time, which is at all events to keep on good terms with France. 

I am with the utmost respect, etc. 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 553 

TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 

No. 35. [ROBERT SMITH] 

ST. PETERSBURG, 15/27 December, 1810. 
SIR: 

Mr. W. B. Adams, who arrived last summer at Archangel, 
and who brought me despatches from your Department, 
being now in this city and desirous of returning as speedily 
as possible to the United States, has determined to go by 
land to Gothenburg in the expectation of finding there some 
American vessel about to return home, in which he may take 
passage. I have procured for him, and for a Mr. Strong 1 who 
goes with him, passports as couriers from Count Romanzoff 
and from Count Stedingk the Swedish ambassador, which 
will expedite their journey to Gothenburg, and have in 
trusted to them both despatches for you, as they will prob 
ably return by different vessels. Mr. Strong s intention is, 
if he finds it practicable, to go first to England. Mr. Adams 
is also charged with despatches from this government to 
Count Pahlen. 

I have detained him several days, in order to inform you 
of the ultimate decision here respecting the admission of the 
American vessels, which arrived at the out ports in the 
Baltic and Gulf of Finland, after the navigation for the 
season was closed at Cronstadt. I have had two interviews 
with Baron Campenhausen on this subject, and indeed have 
detained Mr. Adams at his request. He yesterday informed 
me, that after a full examination and consideration it had 
been concluded that all the American vessels, excepting one 
or two with cargoes of a suspicious character, should be ad-

554 THE WRITINGS OF 

mitted and allowed to dispose of their cargoes, and that I 
might consider and write of the matter as settled. The de 
termination still requires the sanction of the Emperor and if not 
affected by the arrival of a French courier yesterday morning 
from Paris, that will undoubtedly be conformable to the assur 
ance given by Baron Campenhausen. 

In my last letter I stated to you that the first principle of the 
present Russian policy was at all events to keep upon good terms 
with France. This disposition is certainly not on the part of 
France reciprocal. Since the marriage of the Emperor Napo 
leon a continual series of measures in rapid succession has 
manifested a spirit of hostility to Russia scarcely covered with 
a veil of 271. 848. 887. 560. 1032. 1053. 1501. 1098, and news 
paper endearments. The reunion of Holland to the French 
Empire, the dexterous vault of a French general into the Swedish 
succession, an active and formidable organization of troops in 
the Duchy of Warsaw, the establishment of a large French 
garrison at Dantzick, and the encouragement, perhaps even 
assistance, secretly furnished to the Turks for the continuance 
of the war which is exhausting the Russian finances, are indica 
tions of the French policy towards Russia, of which Russia is by 
no means ignorant and to which she is nothing less than blind. 
She sees it all and feels it to the quick, but as every measure of 
this kind is taken without consulting Russia, when she comes to 
deliberate upon it the time for consultation is irrevocably past, 
and the principle of keeping at all events upon good terms with 
France checks the hand of opposition and silences the voice of 
remonstrance. Until lately, however, France has abstained 
from demanding of Russia measures ruinous to her own in 
terests and derogatory to her independence. Such demands are 
now made, and as I have informed you have met with denial. 
It is not probable that France will be satisfied with this, and I 
think the relations between the two countries are approaching 



i8io] JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 555 

to a crisis on a point highly interesting to us. From every as 
surance I have had, and from every quarter I am certain, that 
the determination to resist to the last has been deliberately taken 
here, but at the moment of extremity I still apprehend the issue 
will be such as all my late letters have led you to expect. 1 

I have not time at present to write you more at large; but 
I hope in a few days to have another opportunity of which I 
shall avail myself. Mr. J. S. Smith took leave at court last 
Monday, and leaves us in the course of two or three days. 
He goes to Berlin, Dresden, Vienna and Paris. He goes 
universally regretted by all who have had the pleasure of 
knowing him here; and particularly by myself. Mr. Harris 
the Consul is also going on a tour of six weeks or two months 
to Archangel and Moscow. 

I am most respectfully, etc.

Volume 111796-1801 

The Writings of John Quincy Adams 

EDITED BY WORTHINGTON C. FORD 

To be Completed in Twelve Volumes 
VOLUME I 1779-1796 CLOTH, 8vo, $3.50 NET VOLUME II 1796-1801 

Only those writings, which are of a permanent historical value 
and which are essential to a comprehension of the man in all his 
private and public relations are chosen for this notable collec 
tion. Nothing has been suppressed by the editor which can 
contribute to this main purpose. John Quincy Adams led a very 
eventful life, more than fifty years of it having been passed in 
public service. He was at all times a prolific writer and corre 
spondent and has left behind him a great mass of material. A dis 
criminating selection from this will be of the utmost value, not only 
because of the light which it throws upon one of the leaders of our 
early democracy, but also in that it will serve to vivify the social 
customs of an age that is past. The years covered by the first volume 
are 1779-1796. The second volume covers the years of 1796-1801. 
It contains the letters and dispatches which were written by Mr. 
Adams while he was United States Minister at The Hague and at 
Berlin, and when he was the only American representative in Europe 
of experience. 

"The unsealing of most interesting material . . . the remaining volumes will 
be anticipated by students of history with keen interest." Boston Transcript.

it up with the ensuing volumes no matter how many there may be." JAMES L.

America 

In two volumes, each, cloth, 8w, $2.50 net; by mail, $2.69 

This, the second and final volume of Lee s correspondence, contains 
one hundred and ninety-one letters drawn, like those in the preceding 
volume, from the most varied sources the Papers of the Continental 
Congress, the Arthur Lee Papers, the Adams Papers, the Papers of 
Henry Laurens and Jefferson and Madison. Most of them have 
never before been printed. They are especially abundant for the 
years 1779, 1780, 1781, 1784 and 1785, but extend to the year of Lee s 
death, 1794. They cast a flood of light, in the years mentioned, upon 
the doings of the Continental Congress, upon Lee s own political ac 
tivities and those of his relatives and friends; upon Virginia politics, 
upon the foreign relations of the infant United States, and upon the 
period when its present Constitution was being formed and put into 
operation. 

"Another valuable source of history is put at the disposal of the general reader. 
The volume is full of first-hand information, and provides not only interesting 
reading, but throws new light upon the most critical period of our history." 
Brooklyn Citizen. 

"It contains about five hundred letters written by Richard Henry Lee to various 
persons, all of them reliable texts, taken from original manuscripts or transcripts, 
many of them of great public and historical importance, much of it preserved by 
his correspondents, scattered widely here or there. Lee s distinguished public 
services, patriotically given to the founding and development of the American 
Republic, together with the wisdom and loyalty which characterized these services, 
render these Letters very valuable. They constitute a contribution of rare value 
to the historical and colonial literature of the country." Telescope.

tion." New York Sun. 

"The letters will be welcomed for their historical as well as intrinsic value for 
biographical purposes." Boston Herald.

The Life of Benjamin Disraeli

Each illustrated, cloth, 8vo, 401 pages, $3.00 net; by mail, $3.18 

"Benjamin Disraeli was doubtless one of the most picturesque, brilliant, and 
astute politicians that England ever produced. There are few of the older men 
of this generation, familiar with the political events of the Victorian period of Brit 
ish history, who have not formed firm convictions of this man s character and 
influence. He was in all probability the most aggressive statesman, and the most 
highly praised and severely criticised man that ever rose to fame and influence 
in the British Parliament. Although dead for a generation, men had not ceased 
to wonder at the enormous success he was able to achieve against odds which, to 
ordinary mortals, would have seemed impossible barriers." Boston Herald. 

"It is on the whole a very human, though egotistical Disraeli that the biog 
rapher gives us, brilliant, witty, ambitious, but by no means the unscrupulous 
adventurer that the late Goldwin Smith and other enemies have depicted. His 
best defence is his own personal letters, which the author has wisely allowed to 
constitute the bulk of the book." Chicago Record-Herald.

The American Doctrine of Judicial Su 
premacy 

By CHARLES GROVE HAINES, PH.D. 

Professor of Political Science in Whitman College 

Cloth, i2mo, $2.00 net 

It is the purpose of this volume to present an account of the origin 
and development of the practice of judicial control over legislation in 
the United States. The source of this power is traced from the ancient 
and mediaeval concept of the law of nature, from the idea of a higher 
law made vital and attractive in Coke s theory of the supremacy of 
the common-law courts, and from precedents during colonial and 
revolutionary times until its emergence as a recognized principle of 
American constitutional law. Special attention is given to the differ 
ences between the power as conceived by judges in the eighteenth 
and early nineteenth centuries and the practice of judicial review in 
the last few decades. The opposition encountered in the early years 
of judicial control and in subsequent periods of American history is 
reviewed, including a discussion of recent criticisms by justices, by 
labor leaders and by Socialists. Data from many sources relative to 
the theory and practice of judicial review of legislation are brought 
within brief compass.

The Hon. DEAN C. WORCESTER S New Book 

The Philippines 

BY DEAN C. WORCESTER 

Secretary of the Interior, Philippine Insular Government, 1901-1913 
Author of " The Philippine Islands and Their People," etc. 

2 volumes, Decorated Cloth, Illustrated, 8vo, $6.00 net 

There is no greater authority on these insular possessions than Mr. Worcester who, as 
early as 1887, and again in 1890 was a prominent member of scientific expeditions to the 
Islands; from 1899 to 1901 was a member of the U.S. Philippine Commission; since 1901 
has been Secretary of the Interior to the Insular Government, and who in 1899 published 
" The Philippine Islands and Their People," a record of personal observation and experi 
ence, with a short summary of the more important facts in the history of the archipelago, 
which has ever since been the acknowledged standard work of information concerning the 
Islands. 

In Mr. Worcester s valuable new work, past and present conditions are minutely re 
viewed with regard for strict accuracy of statement. The author s position giving him free 
access to all the government records, much of the information thus made available has 
never been before made public. With practically unlimited material on which to draw in 
the way of illustrations, very fine and rare photographs intimately related with the text 
emphasize the lessons which they are respectively intended to teach. 

The result is a work of the greatest importance as well as of the greatest interest to all 
concerned as to the future possibilities of the Philippines and as to the course the United 
States Government should pursue in the interest of the several peoples of the Islands.
