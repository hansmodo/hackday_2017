London, Xov. Ufa, 1759. 

My dear Lee, 

jl OUR American posts are excessive hard upon 
me, and mal reglee's. You and Montgomery are 
so good as to write to me often from thence. I 
have been, upon honour, very exact in my answers, 
without having been lucky enough that either of 
you should have heard from me. This time I 
hope to be more fortunate, having recommended 
my letter to the best hand. I envy you all the 
service vou have seen whilst I have been in the 
most sluggish inactivity. I have indeed got a son, 
but cela ne conte gueres. Our good fortune, and 
that of our friends, has been indefatigable this 
year. To-day, we have the news of the surrender 
of Munster and the French in Germany retiring, 
probably into winter quarters. Daun is doing the 
same, and is likely to leave the amazing kingol Prussia once more in possession of Saxony. The Russians, we flatter ourselves, will move no more. 
The Brest fleet is out ; Hawke after them, and a 
good account of them hoped for, and expected 
every moment. Next year I hope to have something to do in Germany, where they talk of sending us. I believe you already know my trade — ■ 
Lieutenant Colonel to George Elliott's Light Dra~ 
goons. Being as horse-mad as ever, and having 
the rank of Colonel before by being the King's aid 
de camp, I preferred that to a young regiment of 
foot. So many children have of late been made 
Generals, that we Children- colonels are already 
very high in the list. The riding of this new 
corps has kept me fully employed this whole summer, and I am now come up to town for winter 
quarters, which the season make much more pleasant than the country ones. We are all here in 
grief for the loss of poor Wolfe. Nobody of that 
age can be more publicly and privately admired 
and regretted. The war in America, we are in 
hopes will be over very soon; if so, I shall hope then 
to have the pleasure of seeing you. The French's 
fighting-days seem to be over, or at least, suspended. Every day produces a change amongst 
them, of generals, admirals, and ministry ; and 
every thing speaks them to be in the greatest poverty and disunion. It don't often happen here, or 
any where else, I believe ; but there is certainly 
at present amongst all here the greatest spirits and 
unanimity imaginable, and no appearances of want; 
much debauch, and good living ; so pray come 
amongst us soon. You have the good fortune not 
only to have seen service enough, but most of it 
successful. All vour friends are well. Adieu, 
my dear Lee ! let me hear from you when you 
can, and be assured that no one can interest themselves more sincerely about you than, 

Your most affectionate Friend, and 
Humble Servant, 

pp:mbroke.

Dear Charles, 

London, Nov. IZih, 1759. 

X OU have obliged me very much by a second 
letter come lately to my hands, and dated at Niagara : We had before received accounts of the reduction of it, and your being in possession of the 
glorious country around ; which, by your description, must be a paradise indeed ; and it is much to 
be wished, it may never again go out of your hands. 
Our acquisitions this year have been so great and 
important, that it has been thought proper to appoint to-morrow a public thanksgivingday : and 
though Amherst has not got so forward as was expected, yet he sends word he is master of Lake 
Champlain ; which, as we are possessed of the 
other side of Quebec, must bound the enemy between the two in such a manner, as, we conclude here, will distress them extremely, if not 
oblige them to make submission and surrender. 
In Europe, you will have heard Boscawen fell in 
with the Toulon fleet, and took four of them ; 
and we are now in hourly expectation of Hawke's 
overtaking the Brest fleet, which stole out of the 
harbour the other day, in order, as it is supposed, 
to cover a descent, either upon Ireland or this 
country, which they have long threatened us with : 
but it must be a very desperate game they are 
playing, since, if our ships have the luck to come 
up with them, we have little fear here of their 
giving them such a blow as will put an end to the 
naval force of France for some time to come.*But I will talk no more of public affairs ; it will 
probably be of greater satisfaction to you, to hear 
of the welfare of your friends and relations, which 
I am happily enabled at present to assure you of ; 
for I know not of any exception amongst them 
all. My son is gone to Turin, and I hope we ma; 
presume upon his health, though we have not lately heard from him ; he is to stav here five or six 
months, and afterwards to ramble about Italy another twelve-month. Your sister Sidnev complains you do not write so often as she wishes. I 
gave her the satisfaction of knowing you had favoured me lately with a letter, and that you were 
well and happy, as I am willing to suppose by the 
strain of your style, which is very lively and entertaining. The books and chocolate you desired, 
have been sent to Mr. Calcroft near a month ago, 
who has taken the charge of them ; and I hope 
they will get safe to your hand : But sure you arc 
not to stay on that continent for ever : We wish 
you to come again among your friends, and probably some change might be procured, as well as advance on this side of the water, if you desired it. 
Lord Granby commands in Germany at present, 
and is likely to be at the head of the army on this 
side of the water too, if Ligonier drops ; and it 
is supposed he cannot last a great while longer. 
The taking of Minister, which we had advice of 
the other day, will be of great importance to our 
allied army, and secure them good winter quarters. 
A great many matches are talked of here in town, 
so that if you do not come soon, all our fine young 
ladies will be disposed of; but I know of none 
of your more particular acquaintance that have, 
or are about, changing their state* Pray go on 
writing to us ; nobody better qualified to entertain 
bv their letters : I wish I had as «;ood a knack on 
my side for the sake of your amusement. Your 
aunt and cousins bep; to live constantly in vour 
memory and good wishes ; they desire I win assure you, you have theirs most heartily ; and I 
hope I need not add, that you will invariably have 
those of your affectionate and obliged uncle, 

WILLIAM BUNBURY. 

Capt. Charles Lee.

Warsaw, April 29//i, iTG 7. 

My Dear Colonel, 

J. ADMIRE, very much, the subtilty of your 
reasoning, and the arguments you run after, to 
prove me in fault for the silence you have lonsr 
observed, which, I confess, has furnished me often 
with subject for reflections. The receipt of your 
letter has given me so much pleasure, that I ought 
in gratitude to forget every uneasy thought that 
I have permitted to torment me whilst I was in 
expectation of it ; and therefore shall proceed immediately to thank you for the intelligence it 
brings me, and the assurances it renews of your 
affection and friendship. 

I should have been heartily glad to have heard, 
my dear Colonel, that His Majesty's recommendation had been more successful in procuring you 
an establishment equal to your merit and wishes ; 
but am not at all surprised that you find the door 
shut against you by the person who has such unbounded credit; as you have ever too freely indulged a liberty of declaiming, which many infamous and invidious people have not failed to inform him of. The principle on which you thus 
openly speak your mind, is honest and patriotic, 
but not politic ; and as it will not succeed in 
changing men or times, common prudence should 
teach us to hold our tongues, rather than to risque 
our own foi tunes without any prospect of advantage to ourselves or neighbours. Excuse this scrap of advice, ray clear Colonel, and place it to 
the vent of a heart entirely devoted to your interest. 

I remember my promise, to inform you of the 
transactions of this place ; and had I received a 
line from you upon the road, should have endeavoured to find time during the diet to have given 
you a sketch of the critical and unexpected affairs 
that agitated us ; it will be needless now, as the 
public papers and your other correspondents here 
have, doubtless, not failed to instruct you. The 
important affair of the dissidents was rudely and 
insolently refused ; and you cannot be ignorant 
that those gentlemen have formed two confederations in Poland and in Lithuania, supported by a 
Russian army of thirty or forty thousand men, 
and that we expect a diet extraordinary in the 
months of August or September, for terminating 
their demands, to the satisfaction of the powers 
who interest themselves in their behalf : and 
though it is impossible to say how it will end, yet 
the appearances at present are much in their favour, and we have all reason to think, that it will 
be conducted without any interruption of the tranquillity of the republic. 

You must not imagine, that however important 
this negociation is, that our great men cannot find 
time for other amusements and engagements. — 
The object that engrosses our attention at this moment, is love, and the family of Clavereau, (you 
remembe. the French actor and his two daughters:) Prince Gaspar Lubomirski marries the 
vounsest daughter to day, and the eldest ran awav, 
and married a musician, two days ago, having received from R a considerable sum, as a re
compence for so infamous a part, and as servingonly for a cloak to his views of getting her out of 
her father's house. The father has acted, on this 
occasion, like a prince, and the ambassador like a 
comedian ; the latter laughs, and is content with 
his dexterity, and his flatterers tell him, he is an habile negotiateur : but every prudent and impartial 
man must condemn a person of his rank and character — father of many children, and past the heat 
of youth — for having committed such an extravagance. 

The chart du pais remains pretty much the same 
as when you left us ; the same friendships and the 
same quarrels. You have been the instrument of 
making Lind's fortune ; M— — has given him 
the absolute direction and education of Mons. 
Chambeilan's son, with a pension for life, and he 
is to travel with him in a couple of years ; and I 
cannot but congratulate both parties, for Lindhas 
great merit as a scholar, and a man of principles 
and worth. 

I am much obliged to yon, my dear Colonel, 
for your offers of service, and am convinced, that 
you would seize any opportunity of being useful 
to me; 1 don't know in what manner you can do 
me a greater, than in the conservation of your sentiments for me. Take care of your health, and 
husband well your fortune, which is sufficient to 
make you happy; and, in your happiness, I 
shall always find a sincere satisfaction. Adieu, 
my dear Colonel ! I am, and shall be, to the end 
of my life, 

Your affectionate Friend and Servant, 

THOMAS WROUGHTON, 

Col. Lee, 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

My Dear Lef, 

Island S?. John, Nov. 10///, 171 

"F all men on earth, you are the last from 
whom I expected to hear, unless it was in a paragraph of a foreign Gazette, that such a day Mons. 
General Lee, an Slnglois, was cut to pieces, defending his Poiihh Majesty, or in some desperate 
uncommon attack ; or, which was full as likely, 
that you was hanged for treason, in some of the 
damned arbitrary governments you have been 
wandering through. But, how surprised ! when 
in the place of this, I received a Mattering letter 
from you, dated Dijon. Surely, Lee, the climate 
of France has produced this wonderful effect. I 
am sure in Oid England you would never flatter 
any man, much less one whom you honoured with 
your friendship. Do you not know how apt we 
all are to forget ourselves when in power, or upon 
any sudden elevation ; and how very ready we 
are to believe all the handsome things that even 
the most abject sycophants are pleased to bespatter us with ? Then, my friend, how much more 
dangerous must it be from a man, of whose understanding I have always had the highest opinion ? And who is so remarkable for his candor 
and freedom of speech, that they are, to the disgrace of our day, well known to be his greatest 
enemies. In spite of what I say, I will acknowledge I am proud of your good opinion, though 
delivered in too flattering a style ; but I hope 
it will have no other effect than to make me endeavour to deserve it. 

Taking it for granted, that you will like to 
know how I bear my promotion, I will give you 
as impartial an account of it, in as few words as it 
is possible for a man to give of himself. I feel myself independent, and a slave to slaves, obliged to 
court and flatter men whom I despised, both for 
their want of abilities and want of honesty. I 
hate power, and those in it, more and more every 
day. I am plainer in my table and apparel than 
you ever knew me, without an attempt or wish 
to be rich. I have children and I feel they may 
one day be under another government, on the spot 
where their father once presided. This helps to 
make me careful, and as tender as possible of those 
entrusted to my care. My actions are as public 
as they can possibly be made ; and I hope my 
children and friends will never have reason to 
blush, or be ashamed to hear of them. I find 
the care of a people a more difficult thing than 
I imagined it to be, and I find myself Very defective as a legislator : the former, perhaps time 
may render more easy, and I am endeavouring 
to remedy the latter, by as close an application, 
to study the spirit of the laws of my country, 
as is in my power; in the mean time, I am 
cautious of doing much, least I may do more 
evil than good. This, if I know any thing of myself, is truth. Row you will like the daubed portrait, I know not, nor whether or not, I may not 
forfeit a part of your good opinion, by the badness of the attempt. 

Having said so much of myself, I now come to 
your business; and in the first place, I promise you, 
if it be in my power to do any for you, I will, and 
with more pleasure than you can ask me. In the 
mean time, I can answer ycu some of your queries to a greater certainty, by being here, than if 
I had received your letter in Suffolk street, where 
you directed it to me. You desire to know if it 
is worth your while to lay out any money on your 
lands in this island ; I answer, yes. You have half. of the very best lot on this island, or at least, 
;ss rood as auy, and were I in your circumstances, 
I would he proprietor of the whole of it; in that 
rrianru r I would lay out the first money. There 
are a good many French who live upon it already ; 
but for want of title to the land, they do not improve it as they might : these would commence a 
small rent immediately, for which reason you ought 
to appoint an agent; and if you do not like to 
purchase the other half, you ought to come to 
some agreement with Sir Francis M'Leane, either 
to have a division made of it, or to bear a share of 
the expences; but I would by all means recommend the former, that is to say, to purchase the 
whole, or to have it divided. 

The kind of man, I would recommend to you 
as an agent, would be an English farmer, an active 
fellow, with a genius a little above the common 
run of them ; one that would not be so much 
guided by old customs, as to attempt ploughing 
here in February, because he was used to do so at 
home ; in short, a man who can think a little and 
accommodate both himself and his labour to the 
climate. As you have a plentiful fortune, no matter whether or not he has, perhaps better not. To 
such a man you might give at an easy rent, as 
much land as he thought would make him a complete farm. He ought to bring some servants 
with him, who ought to be bound for three or 
four years, he paying them yearly wages, something more than they get in England. He ought 
to bring likewise all the iron parts of every kind 
of farming utensils, and all the necessary iron work 
for building himself a house ; and, beside that, 
either money, or a credit to purchase cattle and a 
year's provisions. 
If you had such a man well settled ; and it 
should be done in such a manner, that he might 
feel as few inconveniences as possible ; he would 
soon bring you more ; for you may depend upon 
it, the soil and climate both would please him. 
He ought to have a power of attorney to let your 
lands, and indeed as extensive a one as you, from 
your knowledge of the man, would think prudent 
to entrust him with. 

But after all, dear Lee, what is there to hinder 
you from taking a view of the place yourself, nay, 
of being your own agent. Do not you think the 
cultivating your lands, and improving your constitution and fortune, is a much more rational, and 
perhaps I might say, sensible employment, than 
scampering over all the continent of Europe, in 
search of damned Hungarian fevers. Come, Lee, 
and leave Hume to cram his history down the 
throats of his countrymen, for few others read it. 
You will find your gall bladder decrease in size 
very much, without writing strictures upon any 
thing ; or even abusing a king or a Barrington, as 
soon as you set foot upon this our free and hospitable coast : and to encourage you, as I know you 
like good living, I will engage to give you as good 
beef, mutton, poultry, and salt fish, as you ever 
met with, and as my countrymen say, a hundred 
thousand welcomes. And now, taking it for granted, that you will be as tired with reading, as I am 
with writing, by the time you get thus far, I will 
finish, by assuring you, that I am your affectionate friend, and servant, 

YV. PATTERSON. 
Colonel Lee, 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

Dk.ui Sire. 

WetimimUr, Feb. 1.7, 1774. 

-I RECEIVED two letters from you ; one by 
Mr. Hey, the other by the pacquet : I thank you 
most sincerely tor both. Your first was particular!) acceptable, as it gave me an opportunity of 
renewing and of improving my acquaintance with 
a gentleman, for whose character I have always 
had an high esteem. My particular friends were 
the first who took notice of his merit. They imagined, ..hat they could not do a better service to 
government, in a newly acquired French country, 
than to send them one of the best samples we were 
able to furnish of plain manly English sense and 
integrity. I wish those who rule at present may 
shew by the provision they make for him here, 
that such qualities are still in some request among 
ourselves. 

It was extremely kind of you to remember your 
friends in our dull worn out hemisphere, among 
the infinite objects of curiosity, that are so exhuberantly spread out before you, in the vast field 
of America. There is indeed, abundant matter, 
both natural and political, to give full scope to a 
mind active and enterprising like yours ; where so 
much has been done and undone ; and where still 
there is an ample range for wisdom and mistake. 
Either must produce considerable effects in an affair of such extent and importance. It will be no 
light mischief, and no trivial benefit. When one 
considers, what might be done there, it is truly 
miserable to think of its present distracted condition ; but as the errors which have brought things 
into that state of confusion are not likely to be 
corrected by any influence of ours upon either side 
of the water, it is not wise to speculate too much 
on the subject : it can have no effect, but to make 
ourselves uneasy, without any possible advantage 
to the public. 

Here, as we have met so we continue, in the 
most perfect repose. It has been announced to us, 
that we are to have no business but the ^old coin; 
this has not appeared as yet : And if there be nothing further than we hear of intended, it will 
come on time enough. The politics of the continent, which used to engage your attention so 
much, attract no part of ours. Whether the American affairs will be brought before us is yet uncertain. 

Saturday, I heard the Massachusetts petition 
against their governor and deputy, discussed before council. It was spoken to, very ably by the 
counsel on either side ; by Messrs. Dunning and 
Lee, for the province ; by Mr. Wedderburn for 
the governors. The latter uttered a furious philippic against poor Doctor Franklin. It required 
all his philosophy, natural and acquired, to support him against it. I hear that the petition will 
be rejected. The council was the fullest of any 
in our memory ; thirty-five attended. 

I hope, as you say nothing of it in your last letter, that your fit of the gout was but gentle, and 
rather a sharp remedy than any thing that deserves 
to be called a disease. With many thanks for 
your obliging remembrance, and all good wishes 
for an agreeable journey and safe return, I am, 
Dear Sir, 

Your most obedient humble Servant, 

EDMUND BURKE,

Dear Lee, 

ITS 

iWu'-IV/;, Junr 10/4, 177-i. 

1 SHOULD have done myself the pleasure to 
hav< wrote to vou before ; but really did not 
know where a letter would find vou : sometimes 
we heard you were gone to the West- Indies ; at 
another, that you were gone on to Carolina ; by 
Mr. Bird, I am informed you are still in Virginia. 

I expected before now, to have heard from governor Chester, relative to your land in West Florida, but suppose I shall shortly. I set out in a few 
days to join our worthy friend General Gage at 
Boston ; he is come out with very extraordinary 
powers, and has wrote for me : It is a very fortunate circumstance, that the power both civil and 
military hath fallen into the hands of so moderate 
a man as General Gage ; I hope he will gain great 
credit on this critical occasion ; his abilities are 
good, and with respect to his heart, you who 
know him so well, will allow him to be possessed 
of one of the best kind. 

Your things are all left with Mrs. Aire who will 
take care of them. I enclose you a letter from 
Dunbar, and one I picked up in the coffee-house 
for you. Dagworthy has got a company in the 
48th regiment, through Colonel Vaughan's interest. 

I am, Dear Lee, with great truth, 
Yours most sincerelv, 

THOMAS GAMBLE. 
To General Lee. 

Travellers Rest, July 1, 1774. 
My Dear Lie, 

JL RECEIVED your welcome letter by Mr. 
Wormley, and live in daily expectation of seeing you at my hut. I now wish more than ever 
for that satisfaction, as the alarms of the times 
make me earnest to consult, and converse with 
you thereupon. Until actions convince me of 
the contrary, I am resolved to think Mr. Gage 
has some secret medicine in his pocket, to heal the 
wounds that threaten the life of American liberty. 
Surely a man so humane, so sensible, so honourable, 
so independent m his circumstances, and so great 
from family expectations, would never undertake 
a business, fit only for an abandoned desperado, 
or a monster in human shape, a General Murray, a 
Macro, or a Raviiliac. 

I cannot think what detains you so far to the 
Southward, at ihis season of the year ; without 
any disparagement to Williamsburg, health, and 
such as you like for associates, are more certainly 
to be met with to the Northward ; I know not, 
how you find it, but the older I grow, I become 
less and less inclined to new acquaintance: Selfishness and sycophantry possess so generally the 
minds of men, that I think the many are best 
avoided, and the few onlv who are liberal and sincere> to be songht for and caressed. I therefore 
stick steadily to the cultivation of my farm, am 
intimate with few, read when I have time, and 
content myself with such domestic comforts as my 
circumstances and fortune afford me. I wish 
therefore, most anxiously, you would come to my 
retreat, and there let us philosophise on the vices 
and virtues of this busy world, the follies and the 
vanities of the great vulsrar and the small. 

Laugh where we please, be canded where we can, 
And justify the ways of God to man. 

Mrs. Gates is earnest in desiring to see you under her roof, where a good bed is provided for you, 
two or three slaves to supply all your wants and 
whimsies ; and space enough about us for you to 
exercise away all your spleen and gloomy moods, 
whensoever they distress you. In my neighbourhood there is this moment as fine a farm mill, and 
tract of land to be sold as any in America, and 
provided it is convenient to you to pay down half 
the price, lam convinced you may have it a very 
preat bargain. It is altogether two thousand 
fou* hundred acres, at thirty shillings sterling 
an acre; I am satisfied you might have it so. 
By paying down about one thousand eight 
himdn d pounds sterling, you may be put in 
possession of an estate, that ten years hence will 
be worth seven thousand pounds sterling ; and 
I take it for granted, that you may have the payment of the rest of the purchase money, at easy 
installments, and that too without interest; so by 
laying out a thousand pounds sterling more, in 
stocking and improvements, your produce will 
yield you a line living, and wherewithal to pay 
your annual installment, bargained for in the purchase. I suppose you have procured from Lord 
Dup.more his warrant for your five thousand acres 
upon the Ohio, that will be very soon of considerable value. As to the Indians, the behaviour of 
certain of the white people is beyond all comparison abominable towaids those unhappy natives ; 
not content with quiet possession of all the land on 
this side thr Ohio, they demand as a preliminary to 
a peace, all the land between that river and the Missisippi — but this story is too long for a letter, you 
shall know the whole of this iniquitous affair 
when we meet — the gentleman who does me the 
favour to present you this letter, has the pleasure 
of your acquaintance, andean very fully inform 
you of the exceeding wickedness and absurdity 
of the measures pursued, and pursuing, against the 
Indians. I have read with wonder and astonishment Gage's proclamations ; surely this is not the 
same man, you and I knew so well in days of yore ; 
but that men should change, neither you nor I will 
be surprised at ; it is rather matter of amazement 
when they do not. 

August the seventeenth ; I am this instant returned from Baltimore, and hoped to have crossed 
upon you, in your route to the Northward, but 
like Swift's Mordanto you were vanished. I was 
sorry for it, as I might have prevailed upon you 
to have tempered your zeal with caution, before 
all such persons as may reasonably be suspected to 
watch your words and actions, where your zeal in 
the noble cause you mention can be exerted to 
effect, too much cannot besKewn ; but be careful 
how you act, for be assured Gage knows you too 
well, and knows vou know him too well not to be glad of any plausible pretence to prevent your 
good services in the public cause. Farewell, my 
friend; remember I am, what I have always professed myself to be, and that I am ready to risk 
my life to preserve the liberty of the Western 
world. 

On this condition would I build my fame, 

And emulate the Greek or Roman name ; 

Think Freedom's rights bought cheaply with my bloody 

And die with pleasure for my country's good. 

Whi^e \ live, I am 

Yours unchangeably, 

HOEATIO GATES. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

I.onJon, Sept. 34, 1774. 

My drab Lee, 

1 RECEIVED your long letter with great pleasure, and will answer it as fully as I am able. 
You must have misunderstood me, in what I said 
of the bill to alter the Massachusetts government, 
if you imagined I had either concurred in, or 
even ibrborn to express my fullest disapprobation 
of it, when it was depending in the house. The 
fact is so much otherwise, that I fought it through 
every stage, almost alone, when most of the opposition were attending the New-Market meeting, or 
other occupations, equally entitled to be preferred 
to that duty. I may have said indeed, that I prefer the form of the English government to that of 
any other country upon earth, because it appears 
to me most calculated to reconcile necessary restraint and natural liberty, and to draw the line 
between them. It is the government I was born 
under, I am happy to live under, and would willingly die to preserve and transmit entire ; but I 
look upon the first principle of that constitution 
to be, that the whole must be governed by the will 
of the whole, and that any government where the 
authority residing with the few is supported by 
any other power than that of the many, in consequence of their free concurrence and full approbation, is the worst of tyranny. Judge then, my 
dear friend, whether I could approve of tearing 
from a free and happy people that form of government which had been purchased with the blood, 
and established by the wisdom of their ancestors; 
and of subverting that excellent polity, endeared 
to them by their prosperity, and sanctified by the 
most laudable of human predilections, a veneration for their ancestors, and an enthusiasm for the 
permanence of their liberties. Nolo?nus Leges 
Anglitf mutari, was the noblest expression that 
ever bore testimony to the spirit of a free legislature. I think it as' laudable at Boston now, as in 
London some centuries ago. So far I stand upon 
the ground of natural right and manly feeling — 
thus much, I say, because — Homo sum — but to 
descend to the humbler ground of policy, nothing 
can be so absurd, or impolitic, as to shake a frame 
sanctified by long possession, for the caprice of a 
moment, or the fancies of a few ; to sacrifice the 
wisdom of ages to the presumption of an hour ; 
and to divert the stream of government, which has 
fertilised the country and enriched the people, by 
channels which it has gradually formed for itself, 
by surmounting or eluding all the obstacles it has 
met with in its course ; from those channels 
by dams raised by strange hands unacquainted 
with the country, which if they are not borne down 
the torrent must deluge the country and destroy the ancient land-marks. If therefore I prefer in speculation the government of Virginia to 
that of Massachusetts Bay, it is not from thinking 
that what appears best in the abstract, should be 
imposed on all : on the contrary, I am convinced 
that the minds of individuals and the manners of 
a people form and adapt themselves naturally and 
imperceptibly to the mode of government, under 
which they are born. The modifications of municipal institutions are in themselves indifferent, 
provided they are approved by the people ; but it 
is of the essence of freedom, and common to all 
free governments, that the people should be convinced, the laws they live under are of their own 
chusing ; and that there is no power on earth that 
can prolong their existence, or give force to their 
injunctions one hour, after the disapprobation of 
the mass of the people is signified. 
I have been the more lull upon this subject, because I would not willingly be mistaken in my 
principles upon so material a point. Now I am 
Upop the subject of Massachusetts, I cannot help 
expressing my surprize that you should have been 
so far misinformed, as to have believed that I, 
amongst the rest, could speak with "approbation 
of that scoundrel Hutchinson,'' so far from it that 
I agree with you in the epithet, and was the only 
person in the house that declared my detestation 
of his character, and my conviction that his whole 
conduct had been that of a parricide, who had attempted to ruin his country, to serve his own little 
narrow selfish purposes. This 1 did in such pointed terms that I was informed he had afterwards 
waited upon a friend of mine, who did not see his 
character in so just a light, to thank him for what 
he was pleased to call, defending him against me. 
Be assured, I shall never speak well of a man who 
recommends an abridgement of English liberties 
in arty part of the globe, where one spark remains 
unsmothered by corruption, and unextinguished 
by violence. As to the Quebec Bill, I can, with 
pleasure, assure you, that I opposed it, with activity throughout ; and though I could not overset 
it, I was at least fortunate enough to set a defined 
bound to despotism ; and say, so far shall thou go, 
and no farther, by drawing the line which protected New- York and Pennsylvania ; though I have 
since been told, that Burke takes the merit to himself, but upon what grounds I know not, as I proposed the line without any communication with 
iiim. 

As to myself, I am out of Parliament, without any prospect of being in ; and though I should bate thought it infamous to have deserted my post and not endeavoured to get in, yet I hardly can say, that I much regret my being out, there 
is so little prospect of doing good. 

I am dear Lee, 

Yours, &c.

Sir, 

OUR civilities to me when at Prospect-hill, 
were such as I expected from the soldier, and the 
gentleman, and demand my warmest thanks. I 
hope I shall ever bear a grateful remembrance of 
them. 

I see by the papers, that you are removed to 
Newport, in Rhode Island, and therefore suspect 
that the ministerialists, unable to bear the pressure 
of want, and the inclemencies of the season, intend 
to remove from Boston, and make Rhode Island 
their head quarters, at least for some time; but of 
this you can best judge whose experience, in some 
degree, enables you to penetrate the designs of 
those in power. 

The king's speech to both houses of Parliament, 
at the opening of the session, clearly evinces the 
necessity of speedy and effectual exertions on the 
part of this continent, for the purpose of opposing, with force of arms, the infamous plan adopted by a venal ministry, for subverting our 
most inestimable privileges. We should immediately unite, and call forth every spark of virtue 
in so great and important a contest, as all hopes 
of an accommodation are now lost. America is 
happy in having for generals, gentlemen experienced in military operations. 

With ardent wishes that America may rise superior to all oppressions, and become independent. 
I take the liberty of subscribing myself, 

Sir, your obliged, humble servant, 

GEORGE LUX.

Philadelphia, Feb. 19//<, 1T7# & 
My dear General, 

t: ORTUNE seems to be in a good humour with 
you. It is not enough that you have triumphed 
over external and internal enemies at New-York, 
but you are about to enjoy new triumphs in another 
part of the continent. I tremble only at the price 
of victory on the plains of Abraham. 

I presage the surviving your conquests from one 
part of your character, and that is, you have a 
wonderful talent of infusing your spirit into the 
minds of your troops. Should your blood mingle 
with the blood of Wolfe, Montcalm, and Montgommery, posterity will execrate the plains of 
Abraham to the end of time. 

Your appointment to the Canada expedition 
gave all your friends here great pleasure. I think 
it is more than probable, the principal force of 
our enemies will be sent to that quarter. Canada 
is dearer to the king than all the other colonies 
put together, as it is the only part of the British 
empire in which arbitrary power is established by 
law. Should that province become the seat of 
war, we shall have no reason to complain; for 
our sea coasts and sea- port towns are ia a poor 
situation to receive our enemies. 

The Gulf and River St. Lawrence, it is to be 
hoped, will concur with the elements in embarrassing them. Mr. Pitt conquered America in 
Germany ; who knows but General Lee may conquer Britain in America ? 

I need not tell you, how much pleasure it will 
give me to receive a few lines from you by ail the 
expresses you send to the congress. I shall write 
to you most faithfully by the return of each of 
them* Colonel Thompson speaks in raptures of 
you in all companies. 

The bearer of this letter is Mr. Paine, the celebrated author of Common Sense. 

Adieu, Yours &x.

Gen. Lee. j^^jVi^yw fK^iL. 

Winchester, Jan. 17th, 1779. 

Sir, 

OUR favour of the tenth ultimo, did not reach 
me till the twenty-second instant. I that day 
wrote you an answer by one Mr. Campbell who 
w r as on his way, and who promised to give my 
letter a conveyance, if he did not see you. I informed you, that I saw no objections to your paying off the incumbrances on your land, and the future payments whenever it is convenient for you 
to do so. 

I should be happy to see the important subject 
of the independence of North America, discussed in the perspicuous and able manner you are capable of. I have troubled you with some of my 
crude thoughts, to afford you an opportunity when 
leisure will permit, and inclination lead you, to explain my mistakes and correct my errors. From 
the commencement of the present unhapp)^ dispute I considered the shedding of blood, if that 
event should take place, as the aera,at which would 
terminate the British empire in America ; or the 
colonies be subjugated to the absolute domination of parliament ; and when hostilities commenced, my mind was only agitated with the means of 
defending ourselves, and forming a constitution 
which would secure substantial liberty to the people ; but when I found the Congress entertained 
different views, that they had again petitioned the 
king for reconciliation, and declared to their fellow subjects throughout the empire, that their only end in taking up arms was to procure a redress 
of grievances and secure their property and constitutional right, solemnly disclaiming every 
idea of establishing an independent empire, it gave 
a different turn to my thoughts. I reflected that 
our ancestors have fought many battles, and shed 
torrents of blood in support of their constitutional rights, and whatever may have been the fate of 
arbitrary princes, the constitution was ever held 
sacred, the instance of Charles's reign only excepted. The Whigs were then obliged to join 
with the Tories, in restoring royalty in its lustre 
to get rid of a phantom which the Independents 
had raised under the name of liberty. The hope 
of a re- union with our brethren of Great Britain, 
and of the increasing grandeur and prosperity of 
the whole empire to me, I confess, had something 
agreeable in it. I therefore with eagerness investigated the proposed plan of operations, to enable 
me to judge of the probable event, and I found, 
or thought I found, the security of our liberties, 
in connection with Great Britain almost certainly 
attainable ; at any rate more practicable than the 
establishing an independent state ; for the following among other reasons, that the people of America were exterminate ly united in support of that 
measure ; that every insult and injury from administration only tended to animate and cement ; that 
the greatest trading cities and most respectable 
characters in England are our friends ; that even 
our enemies in parliament dare not stand the attack 
on the proper ground ; but, in order to carry their 
point, have always insisted we were aiming at independency. That the belief of this is the sole 
reason we have any enemies among the people of 
England, and though I am of opinion, the governing powers of Britain would rather lose the colonies totally, than yield one iota of their pretensions, the people will think very differently when 
convinced our views extend no "further than to the 
security of those rights, which they themselves 
hold essential to liberty. That it would be impossible for government to carry on a war against the 
inclinations, and so destructive to the interests of 
the people, as the present must obviously appear, 
when it is remembered, the cause of our contest 
is the assumed power of parliament, to tax the 
colonies, to alter our forms of government, to 
transport us to Britain for the trial of supposed 
offences, and to make laws regulating our internal 
police. That the sword would even drop from 
the hand of a British soldier, if he believed it pointed against the breast of a man contending for his 
birth-right. That an attempt to establish an independency would unite England as one man 
against us ; and though she is burdened with an 
enormous debt, and deprived of a most valuable 
branch of commerce, she has still great resources ; 
and it is not easy to foresee the consequences of 
the utmost exertions of her powers. Besides, it 
appears to be the interest of Europe, that America should remain dependent^ The power and 
importance of England, which by a defection of 
the colonies, she would lose, isnecessarvinthe Eu~ 
ropean system. Holland and Portugal, I think, owe 
their political existence to her; and even those states 
which might wish to see her depressed, were their interests confined to Europe, would dread greater e v ils 
from the establishment of an independent empire in 
North America, the certain consequences of which 
would be, I apprehend, the loss of Mexico, South 
America, and the West India islands to whomsoever belonging. But it is a necessary enquiry, on 
what terms can our differences be adjusted which 
will secure us from future contests? I answer, it is 
impossible. The nature of human affairs is such, 
that no political system can be established which the 
folly of weak, or ambition of wicked men will not 
in time subvert. Let Great Britain relinquish her 
claim of internal legislation and taxation ; let stated times be limited for the holding and duration 
of assemblies, and counsellors dependent on the 
Crown, be deprived of legislative powers, or hold 
their places during life; and let supreme judges be 
appointed in each colony, to hold their places during good behaviour, with certain and adequate 
salaries. All this would be no real injury to England, the only advantage she ever did, or ever can 
receive from America is her commerce, an equitable share of which, ought to be secured to her 
by a grand commercial system, to be agreed on by 
the legislators of the two countries, and to remain 
unalterable, except by mutual consent. Such a 
plan of accommodation I think, offers as fair for 
the permament security of peace, wealth, and liberty, 
as any I have heard, or can devise for the government of America in an independent state. I take 
it for granted, as I have never heard it disputed, 
that a popular or democratic government must take 
place, which in its most perfect state, I think 
much inferior to the mixed government of Britain ; for I hold it as a maxim that wherever the 
supreme power is vested in one man, or one body 
of men, the liberty of the subject is at best precarious. It appears from history, that popular 
furv is as formidable, and often exercised with as 
much injustice as royal indignation. Frequent 
elections are no security in this case, the spirit of 
the people always influences the representative 
body, and if a man becomes unpopular, however 
innocent, his ruin is inevitable. To you I need 
not give instances ; neither is it possible in such a 
constitution, to render the judicial powers totally 
independent. The same body of men who have 
the appointment of the judges, having also the 
power of removing them, will carry popular prejudice even to the seats of justice. In this respect, 
England has the advantage of all other nations. 
In cool dispassionate hours, the three branches of 
the legislature concur in enacting laws for the 
general good of the community. The meanest 
subject cannot be punished unless he transgresses 
those laws, neither can the judges be displaced for 
faithfully executing them, without the like concurrence. This protects individuals equally from 
popular violence, and the arbitrary measures of 
kings and courtiers. But is America capable of 
receiving a democratic government? Have we 
that industry, frugality, oeconomy, that virtue 
which is necessary to constitute it ? Laws and 
constitutions must be adapted to the manners of 
the people ; they do not, they cannot form the m. 
Whenever the manners change, the laws change 
with them, or lose their force. Is not North America too extensive for a popular government ? But 
I find the' spji it of the times is against a union; 
we must then become a confedcrac) of republics, 
each having supreme powers within itself. Does 
not this afford a prospect of perpetual wars and internal feuds, till some one colony, or perhaps one 
man, becomes master of the whole continent ? Recur to the historic page, and point out the age and 
country wheie this, under similar circumstances, 
has not been the case ? The united provinces being surrounded by more powerful states, materially distinguishes their situation from that of these 
colonies. A Congress or general council for regulating the afilurs of the whole confederacy will 
hardiy be sufficient to maintain peace. There was 
a general council of the Ei giish heptarchy, yet 
that island was an uninterrupted scene of blood 
and slaughter, till united under one head. There 
is a general diet of the German empire, yet every 
one knows that the princes of the empire submit 
to its decrees, just as far as suits their own purposes. Greece had her Arnphictyons, yet was not 
without intestine wars. 

The country being called to arms for the express 
purpose of defending and seeming her constitutional liberty, is there not an inconsistency in employing those arms to quite different purposes, at 
least till it is known whether the original end be 
attainable? and surely the most sanguine could 
not expect that point so soon determined ? Oi that 
we could force England to a compliance with our 
terms in the course of one campaign. 

An apology might well be expected for this 
trouble'; if I had a good one to offer, you should 
have it. Some slight touches on the subject w ith 
several expressions of regard interspersed through 
your letters of business, emboldened me to take 
this liberty, and further, to request an answer. 

I am one of those who have ever wished and 
gloried in the honour and prosperity of the Br<iish 
empire ; but if a separation takes place, interest, 
inclination, every consideration will induce me to 
take part with rny native land, and my best endeavours shall not be wanting to render the Americans 
a free, happy, and independent people. Any lights 
which you may throw on the subject, shall be faithfully improved to that purpose, as far as my narrow sphere, (and it is a very narrow one,) permits. 
The arguments of pamphleteers, and newspaper 
scribblers, on both sides of the question, have 
been so absurd, fallacious, or at least superficial, 
that very little instruction or pleasure, could be derived from reading them. Heartily wishing you 
success in every patriotic exertion of your abilities, I remain with esteem, Sir, 

Your very humble servant, 

ALEX. WHITE.

^aior Gen. Lee. 

Stafford, Feb. 5th, 1776. 

Sir, 

Immediately after I had waited upon you at 
Philadelphia, I proceeded to New- York, and finding much difficulty in pursuing my intended 
journey, I delivered your dispatches to Mr. Lewis, 
by direction of Mr. Van B. Livingston, and wrote 
to you at my return, acquainting you therewith. 
I have not wrote to you so frequently as I would 
do, imagining that your time might be employed 
better, in matters of greater moment, to the public ; and where public utility is in question, apologies become unnecessary ; be pleased therefore 
to accept the following hints from one who has 
seen service. I am amazed at a ship or two laying 
at New- York for some time past ; I never saw two 
vessels that lay in more danger were they attacked 
and they also know it. The Asia lay long in the 
North River, and refused to go into the sound 

R 
until Parker, a senior captain, was sent with a 
ship to reinforce him, with positive orders from 
the admiral to join; it may also be seen by their 
writing to the mayor, and by Parker's threatening 
and bullying: the town. There are three ways of 
taking or destroying these ships, could it be kept 
secret : First, by boarding ; lor as the Asia must 
ground at low water, the springs upon cables 
would be of no use ; and, I apprehend, that her 
lower guns could not range over the wharf when 
aground, therefore a few 7 guns with grape shot run 
down upon the wharfs, upon her bow and quarters, would effectually sweep and clear her decks, 
while the people boarded. Secondly, if there were 
mortars or even guns to throw combustible matter on the decks, into the rigging, to stick on her 
sides, with grape as before, to prevent extinguishment, the guns with the grape would be out of 
the power of her guns while aground. The third 
and best method, as I imagine, I would undertake myself, with a reasonable person to command 
the detachment, as second in command, or engineer, or conductor of the works, or, as I told you, 
in any character, so that I might be serviceable 
to the cause. 

The method I will here lay down to the best of 
my ability; there is Long Island and Nutten Island, 
well situated to place guns; and, I imagine, three 
or four hundred men would be sufficient to complcat in one night all the necessary w r orks : The 
greatest difficulty would be, to get cannon to Nutten Island, but thev might come from the Narrows 
by night in flats. It would be impossible to point 
out either the facilities, or difficulties of the undertaking in the course of a letter; the greatest difficulty will be, to keep it secret from the people of 
Staten Island, Long Island, and New-York. If 
this matter is not soon put in execution, they will 
be reinforced, or they will fall into the North 
River ; but if there was lodgment with some guns 
upon Nutten Island, with the town battery to assist, 
they could not get out without running aground. 
As soon as the batteries upon Long Island begin 
to play, there should be some of the Connecticut 
men, or some others, ready to run down upon the 
wharfs, with some few guns a-head and a-stern, 
with grape, to clear the decks, and lire into the 
ports. While loading, the batteries will have 
this advantage, that they can play by night, if 
clear; this method will soharrass and disable them, 
that they must strike quickly or they will be boarded. When this affair is finished the men should 
immediately march to the Narrows, and erect a 
battery that would keep all out, and all in ; twenty guns properly disposed, would sink any vessel 
that would dare attempt to go up, and would be 
out of the range of all shot from the shipping. 
Your cruisers would find shelter and a good harbour. Had this been done last summer, our enemies at Boston would have starved before now. 
There should be a camp formed there early in the 
spring, and two strong forts erected with retrenchments to cover them ; for you may depend upon 
it, there will be a rigorous push made early to get 
up the North River ; works upon each side would 
greatly retard and delay their operations ; and I 
doubt not, but defeat the design of the campaign. 
To attack both, f y must divide their army, 
which would greatly harrass them ; and if they 
wait to attack them one after another, the campaign 
is lost, besides the attacks made upon them at landing within the vicinity, and perhaps under cover 
of these forts and retrenchments ; also the attacks 
on their rear, while they are attacking the works, 
In short, we have every thing in our favour, to clcfeat the ensuing campaign, if we only begin in 
time, and conduct matters properly. 

You want nothing but experienced officers five 
hundred at least. But to return to the men of war, 
that I find so much intimidates the people of this 
country, is a well constructed floating battery, formidable and powerful in her own element at sea, 
no doubt ; but when opposed to the land, is only 
an egg-shell. Batteries and guns properly placed 
will soon silence them. I will here describe as well 
as I can, the batteries of late made use of against 
shipping ; the old batteries in our ports and harbours at home are found almost useless. As they 
are all built similar or like that at New- York, verylow and near the water, whereby the vessel has 
all the power over them that she could wish, not 
onh from her great guns, but small arms ; whereas, quite the reverse ought to be the case ; the 
batteries should be fixed at a distance from the 
water and vessel, no nearer than two hundred yards 
if the ground will admit, from the channel, or 
where the vessel is to anchor or sail, and upon 
ground high enough to be out of the range of her 
shot, if such ground cannot be found, take the 
highest, you can get and sink, or let in your platforms and guns upon the top or summit of the 
hill, the muzzles of the guns as it were, peeping 
out of the hill. Thus the men will work their 
guns when thus situated with facility and safety, 
and out of the reach of all tjhot. There is no 
ship in the world that would dare offer to attack 
or pass such a battery, if twenty guns were mounted. These are the kind of batteries that I would 
propose for all attacks upon vessels, and what I 
would make use of, upon Long Island and Nutten Island, and though the land is not so high as 
ma)' be wished, yet the sinking and letting in the 
guns into the firm and highest ground will answer 
the purpose no doubt : ships lire very slow, and 
fire at random, neither can it be imagined tfcat men 
can stand to their guns, where shot and splinters 
are continually flying, much less level and point 
guns accurately. In short, they must do as the 
French did on board of four sail of the line at 
Louisburg, in a short time they must strike or jump 
into the hold notwithstanding we never had more 
than two guns playing upon any ship at a time. 
Twelve guns would be sufficient, six upon Long 
Island and six upon Nutten Island, and twelve 
pounders would be heavy enough as the distance 
is but short, and less than three pound of powder 
would be sufficient for a charge. There ought to 
be two men to each gun that understand loading 
and firing, the rest may be raw. I would imagine 
that Lord Sterling would be a very proper person 
to command the detachment, and would readily accept it. I make no doubt, the troops might keep 
moving, some at the Narrows, some at the Ferry 
at York, some even might go to Jamaica, Flat 
Blush, &c. until guns and other matters are in readiness. The commanding officer and engineer at 
the Ferry, off and on, to reconnoitre the ground, 
and view the position of the vessels. I have here 
thrown a few matters together, in a rough manner ; 
however, I shall not needlessly make any apology 
for troubling you, as the intention is good. I can 
assure you, that these hints, as I. call them, are no 
whrm, or production of ray own, but are drawn 
from real practice and experience which I have often seen and helped to execute in rivers, lakes, and 
harbours, during twenty-eight years service. I 
cannot dismiss the Narrows, the enemy should not 
be allowed to slip into the heart of the country without gaining- it by inches: the Narrows ai ■ 
centrical and the people thereabouts disposed to 
he troublesome ; it is a most desirable situation 
for an army, as they can act either to the eastward, 
or westward together, or separate, and supplies 
can come from all quarters either by land or water. 
A battery placed as before mentioned has great 
power and command of shipping , one shot fired 
in this angular manner from an eminence, will do 
more execution than twenty fired horizontally ; for 
if the shot strike the vessel on one side, between 
windand water, they willcomeout on the other side 
some feet below water ; in short, their powder-room 
and all isin danger, nor will the men's lying flat upon 
the decks screen them. I have had experience of 
this, acting as a marine officer on board men of 
war. You want, as I have said before experienced officers, who have explored the country, 
rivers, lakes, difficult passes ; in short, that know 
every inch of ground, that have drubbed, and 
been drubbed ; for drubbing brings men to reason and reflection. I beg you would offer my services to the honourable the Congress, as one that 
has seen service both in horse, foot, and marines. 
There is not an officer in America this day has 
seen more service than I have, both abroad and at 
home during both the late wars. Nothing would 
prevail with me to engage again, but the present 
cause : my all is now at'stake, the die is thrown : 
[ must conquer or die. 

I am, Sir, most respectfully 

Your most humble and most 
Obedient Servant, 

TREVOR NEWLAND. 

Major Gen. Lee.

Dear Sir, 

Philadelphia, Feb. 11/?, 1775. 

A HE bearer, Mods. Arundel, is directed by the 
Congress to repair to General Schuyler, in order 
to be employed by him in the Artillery service. 
He proposes to wait on you in his way, and has 
requested me to intrduce him by a line to you. 
He has been an officer in the French service, as 
you will see by his commissions ; and professing 
a good- will to our cause, I hope he may be useful 
in instructing our gunners and mattrosses : perhaps he may advise in opening the nailed cannon. 

I received the enclosed, the other day, from an 
officer, Mr» Newland, who served in the two last 
wars and was known by General Gates, who spoke 
well of him to me when I was at Cambridge. He 
is desirous now of entering into your service. 
I have advised him to wait upon you at NewYork. 

They still talk big in England, and threaten 
hard ; but their language is somewhat civiller, at 
least not quite so disrespecful to us. By degrees 
they come to their senses, but too late, I fancy for 
their interest. 

We have got a large quantity of salt-petre, one 
hundred and twenty ton, and thirty more expected 
Powder-mills are now wanting ; I believe we 
must set to work and make it by hand. But I still 
wish, with you, that pikes could be introduced, 
and I would add bows and arrows : these were 
good weapons, not wisely laid aside : 

1st. Because a man may shoot as truly with a 
bow as with a common m&sket. 

2d. He can discharge four arrows in the time 
of charging and discharging one bullet. 
3d. His object is not taken from his vie w by tl 
smoke of his own side. 

4th. A flight of arrows seen coming upon them 
terrifies and disturbs the enemies' attention to his 
business. 

5th. An arrow striking in any part of a man 
puts him hors du combat till it is extracted. 

6th. Bows and arrows are more easily provided 
every where than muskets and ammunition. 

Polydore Virgil, speaking of one of our battles 
against the French in Edward the Third's reign, 
mentions the threat confusion the encmv was 
thrown into, sagittarum nube, from the English ; 
and concludes. Est res proftcto dictu nrirables, ut 
tantus ac pot ens exercitus a soli $ fere Angiitis sagittariis victus fuerit ; adeo Anglus est sagitti 
potensj et id genus armorum valet. If so much 
execution was done by arrows when men wore 
some defensive armour, how much more might 
be done now that is out of use ! 

I am glad you are come to New- York, but I 
also wish you could be in Canada. There is a 
kind of suspense in men's minds here at present, 
waiting to see what terms will be offered from 
England. I expect none that we can accept ; and 
when that is generally seen, we shall be more unanimous and more decisive : then your proposed 
solemn league and covenant will go better down, 
and perhaps movt of your other strong measures 
adopted. 

1 am always glad to hear from you, but I do not 
deserve your favours, being so bad a correspondent. My eyes will now 7 hardly serve me to write 
by night, and these short days [have been all 
taken up by such a variety of business, that I 
seldom can sit down ten minutes without interruption. — God give you success. 

I am, with the greatest esteem, 

Yours affectionately, 

B. FRANKLIN.

My Dear Sir, 

A HE Congress have seen such a necessity of an 
able commander in Canada, as to destine you to 
that most arduous service. I tremble for your 
health, yet I hope the campaign will rather promote 
it than otherwise. We want you at New- York ; 
we want you at Cambridge ; we want you in Virginia ; but Canada seems of more importance 
than any of those places, and therefore you are 
sent there. I wish you as many laurels as Wolfe 
and Montgomery reaped there, with an happier fate. Health and long life after a glorious 
return. 

But I am ashamed to s;o on in such a strain 
when writing to you whose time is so much better 
employed than in reading it, since I took up my 
pen only to introduce to your acquaintance a 
countryman of yours, and a citizen of the world, 
to whom a certain heretical pamphlet, called Common Sense, is imputed. JBis name is P a i n e. He 
is travelling to New-York for his curiosity, and 
wishes to see a gentleman whose character he so 
highly respects. 

A luckier, a happier expedition than yours to

world are blessing you for it, and none of them 
more than,

Sir, 

A HAVE the honour to inclose you sundry resolutions of Congress, by which you will perceive, 
it is the desire of Congress, that you should repair 
to Canada, and take upon you the command of 
the army of the United Colonies in that province. I need not mention the importance of the 
trust reposed in you, and the happy effects it will 
have in securing the liberty of America, if you 
should be so fortunate as to drive our enemies, the 
enemies of liberty and the rights of mankind 
out of it. I heartily pray that the Disposer of 
Events may grant you success equal to your merit 
and zeal. 

As you will want battering cannon, which are 
not to be had in that province, you are to apply 
to the Convention, or Committee of Safety of 
New- York ; to whom, by this opportunity, I send 
the recommendation of Congress to supply you 
with twelve, such as you shall judge most suitable, and some mortars, if they have or can procure 
them ; with balls, shells, and other necessaries ; 
and also to assist you in forwarding them. Eight 
tons of powder arc now on their way to Albany, 
for the forces in Canada; and as a very considerable quantity of saltpetre is sent to the mills of 
Mr. Wisher and Mr. Livingstone, should there be 
occasion for more, you will be supplied from 
thence. 

You will readily perceive the necessity of conferring with General Schuyler, and with him consulting on the best methods of having necessaries 
conveyed to you across the lakes. The Congress 
have a full confidence that you will co-operate in 
securing the possession of the lakes, and mutually 
assisting each other as occasion may require; and, 
as far as in your power, give mutual aid in supporting the cause of freedom and liberty. I expect 
the deputies will in a short time be ready to proceed to Canada. 

I am, with every sentiment of esteem, 

Sir, 

Your most obedient, 

Humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, Pres. 

Hon. Major Gen. Lee.

Dear Sir, 

A.FTER a warm contest, occasioned by the high 
estimation the members of Congress have of your 
worth and abilities, every one wishing to have 
you where he had most at stake, the Congress 
have at length determined to supercede the orders 
given you to proceed to Canada, and have this 
day come to a resolution that you shall take the 
command of the continental forces in the southern 
department which comprehends Virginia, North 
Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. 

The Congress have also appointed six new brigadier Generals ; viz. John Armstrong, William 
Thompson, Andrew Lewis, James Moore, Lord 
Sterling, and Robert How, Esq. four of whom 
you are to command in the southern department, 
and two in the middle. By this conveyance I 
have forwarded the commission for his Lordship. 
As soon as your health and the necessary orders 
3'OU may think proper to give for putting NewYork in a state of defence, will permit, I lave it 
in charge to direct that you repair t o e t! le department put under your immediate command. 
In expectation of seeing you soon in this place, 
on your way, 1 need not add, but diat, I am, with 
every sentiment of regard and esteem, 

Sir, 
Your most obedient servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, Pn s

Head-quarter*, I> ! >. Co//.. fTH 

I) far General, 

I. j A ST night I had the pleasure to receive yours 
of the 15th. I am rejoiced you have weathered 
this fit of the gout ; 1 don't think you will have 
another this winter, if vou was careful in letting: 
that pass off; it may probably be of much service 
to your constitution. When 1 mentioned Canada, 
I did not mean you should winter there ; if you 
can secure the entrance into it, by getting Quebec, 
and possessing it this summer, you may leave the 
care of that province to your Brigadiers for the 
winter to come. The General was pleased you 
wrote to him, as he began to think you tard y. 
He writes to you by this express. I like your intention of making the fort an open redoubt : I 
think some heavy guns upon the south and west 
sides, with good sod merlons, will make the men 
of war keep aloof. It is a pretty high situation, 
and battering it at a distance, over the lower batteries, would have but little effect. We have 
lately had reason, to suppose Mr. Howe had 
thoughts of leaving Boston ; the General will tell 
you his reasons for thinking that was intended. 
Clinton, I am satisfied, went to see how affairs 
were circumstanced at New-York, to consult with 
Tryon, and to prepare the way for Howe's reception. Unless the enemy repossess Canada, they 
cannot reinstate the king's affairs on this continent ; there is no way to recover Canada, but 
by the Rivers of St. Laurence and Hudson. The 
St. Laurence is not practicable until late in May ; 
therefore, the first attempt would most assuredly be 
made at New- York: for these reasons, I think 
vour hands should be strengthened as much, and 
as expeditiously as possible. I am afraid you are 
deficient in gun-carriages ; employ all the hands 
you can procure to make them. I am glad you 
express yourself so well pleased with the captains, 
Smith and Badlam ; the former has good talents, 
and will, I hope, prove as faithful as he is capable. 
Ere long it will be known, if I am right in my 
conjecture, that the great body of the enemy mean 
to endeavour to take post at, or near, New- York. 
Should that happen to be attempted, be assured 
we shall march with the utmost expedition to support you. I expect soon to see Palfrey, in consequence of what I wrote to him, when I hope to 
hear you are in perfect health. Little Eustace is 
well, but nothing is done for him as yet, You 
know the more than Scotch partiality of these 
folks* I have had much to do to support the lad 
you put into Colonel Whitcomb's regiment. They 
have no complaint in nature against him, but 
that he is too good an officer. What, in the 
name of reason, can Hite have trumped up, to commence a suit in Chancery upon ? Mrs. Gates and 
I have puzzled our brains to find it out. The inclosed I desire you will order to be immediately 
delivered to the postmaster. Mrs. Gates joins me 
in every good wish for your health ;nd success. 
I am ever affectionately, yours, 

HORATIO GATES.

Dear Sir, 

A REJOICE that you are going to Canada. I 
hope the gout will not have the courage to follow 
you into that severe climate. I believe you will 
have the number of men vou wish for. I am told 
there will be two thousand more, but there are always deficiencies. 

The bearer, Mr. Paine, has requested a line of 
introduction to you, which I give the more willingly, asl know his sentiments are not very different from yours : he is the repute.!, and, I think, 
the real author of Common Sense > a pamphlet that 
has made great impression here. I do not enlarge, 
both because he waits, and because I hope for the 
pleasure of conferring with you face to face in Canada. I will only add, that we are assured here on 
the part of France, that the troops sent to the 
West- Indies have no inimical views to us or our 
cause. It is thought they intend a war without a 
previous declaration. 

God prosper all your undertakings, and return 
you with health, honour, and happiness. 
Yours most aftectionatelv, 

B. FRANKLIN.

Philadelphia, July Z2d, 1776. 
Sir, 
r 

OUR favour of the 2d instant, containing the 
very agreeable intelligence of the success of the 
American army under your command, I had the 
honour of receiving, and immediately laid the same 
before Congress. 

The same enlarged mind, and distinguished ardour in the cause of freedom, that taught you to 
despise the prejudices which have enslaved the 
bulk of mankind, when you nobly undertook the 
defence of American liberty, will entitle you to 
receive from posterity the same due to such exalted and disinterested conduct. 

That a handful of men, without the advantage 
of military experience, animated only with the sacred love of liberty, should repulse a powerful 
fleet and army, are circumstances that must excite 
gratitude and wonder in the friends of America, 
and prove a source of the most mortifying disappointment to our enemies. 

Accept, therefore, Sir, the thanks of the Independent States of America, unanimously declared 
by their delegates to be due to you and the brave 
officers and troops under your command, who repulsed with so much valour the attack that was 
made on the state of South Carolina, on the 28th 
of June, by the fleet and army of his Britannic 
Majesty ; and be pleased to communicate to them 
this distinguished mark of the approbation of their 
country. 
I have the honour to be, with the greatest respect, 
Sir, your most obedient, 

And very humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, Pres. 

Major Gen. Lee.

My dear Lk£, 

New-York, May, 17*76. 

OUR favour of the 5th ult. from Williamsburg, 
the first I have received from you since you left this 
city, came to my hands by the last post. I thank 
you for your kind congratulations on our possession of Boston. I thank you for your good wishcs in our future operations, and hope that every 
diabolical attempt to deprive mankind of their 
inherent rights and privilges, whether made in the 
east, west, north, or south, will be attended 
with disappointment and disgrace, and that the authors in the end will be broughtto such punishment, 
as an injured people have a right to inflict. 

General Howe's retreat from Boston was precipitate, beyond any thing I could have conceived. 
The elestruction of the stores at Dunbar's camp 
after Bradclock's defeat was but a faint image of 
what was seen at Boston ; artillery carts cut to 
pieces in one place ; gun carriages in another ; 
shells broke here ; shot buried there, and every 
thing carrying with it the face of disorder and 
confusion, as also of distress. 

Immediately upon their embarkation, I detached a brigade of five regiments to this city, and 
upon their sailing, removed with the whole 
army hither, except four regiments at Boston, 
and one at Beverley, &c. for the protection 
of those places, the stores and barracks there, 
and for erecting works for defending the harbour of the first. Immediately upon my arrival here I 
detached four regiments by order of Congress to 
Canada, (to wit, Poors, Patterson's, Treaton's and 
Bond's) under the command of BrigadierThompson, and since that, by the same authority, and in 
eonseemence of some unfavourable accounts from 
that quarter, General Sullivan and six other regiments, namely, Starke's Reed's Wain's Irvine's, 
Wind's and Dayton's have moved oft' for that department ; the four last regiments are of Pennsylvania and New-Jersey. The first brigade arrived 
at Albany the twenty-fourth ultimo, and were moving on, when accounts came from thence the 
twenty-seventh. The other brigade must all be 
at Albany before this, as some of the regiments 
sailed ten days ago, and the last four, and the winds 
very favourable. This has left us very weak at 
this place, whilst I have my fears that the reinforcement will scarce get to Canada in time, for 
want of teams to transport the troops, &c. to 
Fort George, and vessels to convey them on afterwards. 

We have done a great deal of work at this 
place. In a fortnight more, I think the city will 
be in a very respectable state of defence. Governor's Island has a large and strong work erected, 
and a regiment encamped there. The point below, called Red Hook, has a small, but exceeding 
strong barbet battery ; and several new works are 
constructed, and many of them almost executed 
at other places. 

General Ward, upon the evacuation of Boston, 
and finding that there was a probability of his removing from the smoke of his own chimney, applied to me, and wrote to Congress for leave to resign. A few days afterwards, some of the officers, 
as he says, getting uneasy at the prospect of his 
leaving them, he applied for his letter of resignation, which had been committed to my care ; but, 
behold ! it had been carefully forwarded to Congress, and as I have since learnt, judged so reasonable, [want of health being the plea,) that it was 
instantly complied with. Brigadier Fry, previous 
to this, also conceiving that there was nothing entertaining cr profitable to an old man, to be marching and counter-marching, desired, immediately on the evacuation of Boston^ (which happened 
on the 17th of March,) that he might resign his 
commission on the llth of April: the choice of 
the day became a matter of great speculation, and 
remained profoundly mysterious till he exhibited his account, when there appeared neither more nor 
less in it, than the completion of three calender 
months ; the pay of which he received without 
any kind of compunction, although he had never 
done one tour of duty, or, I believe, had ever been 
out of his house from the time he entered till he 
quitted Cambridge. 

So much for two Generals : I have next to inform you that the Pay- master-general, Colonel 
Warren, not finding it convenient to attend the 
army, from the various employments and avocations in which he was engaged, also resigned his 
commission, and is succeeded by your old aid, 
Palfrey. 

When I was speaking of the distressed situation 
of the king's troops, and the tories, at their evacuation of Boston, I might have gone on, and added, that their misfortunes did not end here. It 
stems upon their arrival at Halifax, many of the 
former were obliged to encamp, although the 
ground was covered deep with snow ; and the latter, to pay six dollars a-wcek for sorry upperrooms, and stow in them, men, women, and children, as thick comparatively, as the hair upon their 
heads. This induced many of these gentry to 
return, and throw themselves upon the mercy and 
clemency of their countrymen, who were for sending them immediately back, as the properest and 
severest punishment they could inflict ; but death 
being preferred to this, they now wait in confinement, an}' other that may be thought due to such 
parricides. 

All the ships of war have left this place, and 
gone down to the Hook, except the Asia, which 
lavs five miles below the Narrows, andabouttwelve 
or fourteen from hence. I could have added more, 
but my paper will not admit of it. With complimeat, therefore, to the gentlemen of my acquaintance with you, and with the most fervent wishes 
for your health and success, 

I remain, 

Your most affectionate, 

G. WASHINGTON. 

Major Gen. Lee.

Tga'juin, North Carolina, June 11th, 1776. 

Sir, 

A HIS moment yours of the 1st instant came to 
my hand. The note inclosed, directed to the commanding officer of the corps of Virginia forces, 
intended for the station of Hillsborough, I will 
use my best endeavour to transmit so soon as I 
can learn who he is, or for what part of Virginia 
they are ordered ; of both I am now entirely uninformed, having heard nothing of such destination until I received your letter. If I can get no 
information in my neighbourhood, I will send 
your note to the commanding officer of Halifax or 
Mecklinburgh county ; which, lying contiguous 
to this, are most likely to have received orders to 
march hither. 

I cannot say, Sir, that I rejoice that the enemy 
have abandoned their design on this colony. 
Their force could not have effected much against 
us, but they may prove troublesome to some of 
our southern neighbours, who are probably not 
so well provided for defence as we are. 

I beg leave, Sir, to wish you all possible success 
in your generous efforts for the defence of the undoubted rights of mankind. Had the scene of action been where we first expected, I intended to 
have put my self a volunteer under your command, 
and to have contributed my little assistance towards that success which I am assured would ha\ 
attended your command. Remote as the scene 
may be, I shall not bear absence from it with 
much patience ; and were it not almost ruin to my 
private affairs, no campaign should pass without 
receiving the little assistance I could personally 
give ; for though I am no military eh tracter, nor 
ambitous of such distinction, the cause in which 
we are now engaged, and in which I have unremittingly struggled since the stamp act, makes me 
anxious to be a witness and an actor, however inconsiderable, in every scene of importance whether 
military or civil, which may relate to it. 

I have the honour to be, with singular respect, 
Sir, your obedient servant, 

THOMAS BURKE.

Dear Sir, 

Philadelphia, June 17///, 1773. 

X HEARTILY thank you for your letter, and 
regret that I cannot have the pleasure of meeting 
you ; the great wish of my life is to see peace between two countries I almost equally love, while 
it is a question whether this or an inexterminable 
war is to take place. I meant in. words I had 
learnt from you, to set before you the many ancT 
mutual advantages both would derive from an 
agreement : and as the terms now offered are more 
for the interest of your favourite America than 
you ever hoped to obtain, 1 should Live made no 
scruple to ask your good offices, and to engage 
my own, to remove any obstacles that might obstruct the peace. 

I should think it a greater honour to contribute 
in the smallest degree to this, than to have '4ie 
greatest share in bringing about victory : these, to 
a thinking man like you, who has many friends 
on both sides, subject him to a double regret 

I may not find another occasion of meeting you 
easily, but I would travel far to have the pleasure 
of embracing you, as a fellow subject of the same 
empire, and a friend. You will see by some 
speeches in the House of Commons, that others 
whom you value have the same wish. A celebrated poem, just published, says, 

*' By virtue, captive Lee is doubly blest." 

A pamphlet wrote by Governor Johnstone's 
brother is much applauded by the nation, where a 
spirit prevails like that between tender relations 
who are more disposed to love and respect, after 
a quarrel has convinced both, of the advantage 
and value of friendship. I send you the pamphlet. 

You do Sir H. Clinton great justice in believing him incapable of an inhuman or illiberal measure ; you may, with great confidence, assert, that 
he had no share in the havock you say has embittered peoples' minds to a degree of madness. 
Your letter to me is the only notice he has of the 
burnings you mention. If any other houses besides magazines were destroyed, it must have been 
by the wantonness of soldiers ; as the officer who 
formed the plan for destroying the preparations 
for the invasion of the island, confined it to this 
object. The destruction of houses was no part 
of his project ; otherwise he would have mentioned the success of it, which, he has not done. I 
will deliver the messages you give me, and will 
ever seek every occasion to shew that I am with 
regard, 

Dear Sir, your most affectionate friend, and 
humble servant, GEO. JOHNSON. 
P. S. Sir Henrv Clinton bids me thank vou for 
your k ttgr, and charges me to enclose one he has 
received for you, from England.

Williamsburg, J ah/ idth, 17 76. 

My Dear General, 

\ OUR kind concern for my health made me 
happy, and the high approbation you express of 
my public conduct highly gratified my pride. I 
had the pleasure of receiving your letter which did 
me so much honour, about the 9th of last month. 
I was- then at Mr. Harrison's near Petersburg, 
where I had gone with Mrs. Page for the recovery 
of her health. Our trip happily has answered our 
wishes, and we are once more fixed at Williamsburg. It is now four weeks since we have received any certain account of the situation of affairs in either of the Carolinas. Even your letter to brigadier Lewis countermanding the march 
of the troops did not arrive here till four weeks 
after it was written. The regiments had just began their march ; but had they not been scattered 
abroad on distant stations, and badly provided with 
necessaries for such an expedition, they would have 
reached the place of their destination before your 
express could have stopped them. It will be 
worth your while to examine into the occasion of 
this. I thought it a matter of so much importance to have such orders communicated with dispatch, that I advised the brigadier to send an express to you immediately, to inform you of the unaccountable delay that yours had met with, and to 
recommend it to you to establish a post throughout 
your district ; but he was preparing for an expedition against Gwynn Island. The brigadier set 
out last Monday on his way to our camp, attended 
by the Colonels Woodford, Stephens, Buckner, 
Weedon, and some others, intending to examine 
into the strength of the enemy, and submit the 
propriety of an attack to a council of war. They 
reached the camp that night, and the next day 
finding that the Dunmore had changed stations 
with the other, and had exposed herself very prettily to the very place where we had been preparing 
a battery for the Otter, they determined not to lose 
this good opportunity of beginning their cannonnade, in which they might severely and principally 
chastise the noble Earl. At eight o'clock, A. M. 
captain Arundel and lieutenant Denny saluted the 
Dunmore and Otter, with two eighteen pounders; 
the very first shot at the Otter, though a full mile 
from our battery, struck her, as it is supposed, between wind and water, for she did not return the 
fire, but was towed oft' on the careen. The Dunmore fired a broadside, and then was towed oft, 
having received four shot through her sides ; whilst 
she was in tow, she received a fifth through her 
stern which raked her, scarcely a shot was fired 
which did not do execution in some part of the 
fleet. A schooner lost one of her masts. Whilst lieutenant Denny was firing on the fleet, their battery 
on the island began to play on him, and a ball passed through the embrazure ; on which he immediately turned his cannon on their battery ; for he had 
taken the precaution to have scope enough to take 
in the fleet, and that part of their battery ; and 
firce 1 three times successively into their embrazure, 
which three rounds completely silenced that part 
of the battery ; the other part facing our lines on 
the Haven was almost as soon silenced by our battery erected against it with four nines and three 
six pounders. Part of their camp was a little exposed to both of our batteries which fired a few 
rounds into it. This fire was as well directed as 
that against their ships ; for it beat down many of 
their tents, and threw their camp into the utmost 
confusion. When this was discovered, the brigadier ordered canoes to be brought down, to enable 
the men to pass over into the island ; for, unhappily, we had not a boat on the shore : these could 
not be procured till the next day, when a smart 
cannonade began between the batteries ; hut as 
soon as our men had manned their boats, their fire 
ceased, and they retired with precipitation to their 
boats, and escaped safely to their ships, having first 
broken off the trunnions, &c. of their cannon. 
There were three tenders up the haven which 
could not pass our batteries ; these they abandoned ; they endeavoured to burn one, but our 
men boarded it, and extinguished the flames. I 
understand that all these tenders have their swivels 
in them ; but it is reported that they had thrown 
the guns overboard. We are now in possession of 
the island. The fleet has retired, but is in sight. 
This might have been a complete affair, if proper 
measures had been preconcerted, and the whole 
well conducted. Our men, however, behaved 
well, our artillery was admirably served, and we 
have disgraced and mortified our enemies. In this 
affair we lost not a man ; but most unhappily poor 
Captain Arundel was killed by the bursting of a 
wooden mortar, with which he was endeavouring 
to throw shells into the fleet. His loss is irreparable. He behaved with great spirit and activity, 
and was so hearty in our cause that he is universally 
lamented. Colonel Stephens is just returned from 
Gwynn's Island, he says the enemy carried off all 
their cannon from their batteries, except one six 
pounder, which they spiked. They left six carriage guns in one of the tenders ; several negroes 
and a few whites were taken ; two negroes and 
one of the fourteenth regiment deserted to us. 
The prisoners inform, that Lord Dunmore's 
mate was cut in two by a double headed eighteen 
pounder, which also took off one man's arm and 
another's leg, and drove a splinter into his lordship's leg. Tom Byrd was ill of a fever, and 
was carted off to a boat just before our people 
landed. They were obliged to burn two fine small 
vessels that day, and at night, in the mouth of the 
river, they burnt also a large ship, supposed to be the Dunmore, as she was not with the fleet next 
morning. The Fowey it is said, was with the fleet 
but did not chuse to come within reach of our 
guns. The Roe-buck was at the mouth of Rappahannock. The Colonel says, when he came 
away, the whole fleet had sailed, and were out of 
sight, and it was uncertain where they are gone ; 
suppose to Maryland ? They went off in a bad 
plight without biscuit or water. Their works 
were found of excellent construction and considerable extent ; they were preparing to build houses 
and a wind-mill : they had made a vast collection 
of materials for different works ; their tents, which 
they moved oft', except one markee which was left 
in their hurry, and through which a cannon ball 
had passed, were capable of containing about seven or eight hundred men. From many circumstances it is evident they meant to stay there a considerable time. I have been interrupted in writing, 
and before I could return to my scrawl, I had the 
happiness to receive your letter of the third of 
July. I most heartily congratulate you on your 
success ; it was a most glorious affair — a noble defence ! The British navy has been happily checked in her proud career, and has received a most 
just and complete chastisement. What must the 
kino; think now ? The whole continent in arms 
against him, seven hundred and fifty of his favourite Highlanders in our possession, and his fleets repulsed and disgraced along our coasts for two 
thousand miles ! I hope he will repent and be 
contented to put up with the loss of America, or, 
if he docs not, that he may meet with repeated 
disappointment. The Marylanders were roused 
by the resolve of our Convention, and have lectured their representatives so well, that they have 
unanimously voted for independence — they have 
no occasion for our riflemen on that account : 
However I can assure you, on the eastern shore 
of Maryland there has been a considerable insurrection of tories, insomuch that Colonel Fleming has been obliged to march with a hundred and 
twenty men to quell them. We have not yet heard 
the event of that affair. I have just now received 
another letter from you, and am delighted with 
your description of the bravery of Colonel Moultrie and the garrison of Fort Sullivan. It is not 
flattery, my dear General, when I tell you, that 
most of us here attribute the glorious display of 
bravery on that day, to the animating presence of 
a commander, who, independent of his great military abilities and experience, appeared to be the 
evil genius of Clinton, who had followed him, and 
from whose presence he had seemed to retire and 
retreat along the coast, from Boston to Charles 
Town. All that I could do, as there were not 
gentlemen enough in town to make a council, was 
to desire brigadier Lewis to send immediately to 
North Carolina, all the powder that could be spared out of the magazine. About four thousand 
pounds will be sent. 

I am most sincerely yours, 

JOHN PAGE.

Philadelphia, July 23i,lTf6. 

Dear General, 

XT would take a volume to tell you how many 
clever things were said of you, and the brave 
troops under your command, after hearing of your 
late victory. It has given a wonderful turn to our 
affairs. The loss of Canada had struck the spirits 
of many people, who now begin to think our cause is not abandoned, and that we shall yet triumph 
over our enemies. 

The declaration of independence has produced 
a new aera in this part of America. The militia 
of Pennsylvania seem to be actuated with a spirit 
more than Roman. Near two thousand citizens 
of Philadelphia have lately marched towards NewYork, in order to prevent an incursion being made 
by our enemies upon the stare of New Jersey. 
The cry of them all is for battle. I think Mr. 
Howe will not be able to "ret a footing in New\ork, and that he will end the present, or begin 
the next campaign in Canada, or in some one of 
the southern colonies. The only places in which 
America is vulnerable. We depend upon Gates 
in the north, and you oblige us to hope for great 
things from the south. 

The tories quiet, but very surly. Lord Howe's 
proclamation leaves them not a single filament of 
their cobweb doctrine of reconciliation. 

The spirit of liberty reigns triumphant in Pennsylvania. The proprietary gentry have retired to 
their country seats, and honest men have taken the 
seats they abused so much in the government of 
our state. 

The papers will inform you, that I have been 
thrust into Congress. I find there is a great deal 
of difference between sporting a sentiment in a 
letter, or over a glass of wine upon politics, and 
discharging properly the duty of a senator. I feel 
myself unequal to every part of my new situation, 
except where plain integrity is required. 

My former letters to you, may pass hereafter 
for a leaf of the Sibyls. "They are full of predictions ; and, what is still more uncommon, some of 
them have proved true. I shall go on and add, 
that I think the declaration of independence will 
produce union and new exertions in England in 
the same ratio that they have done in this country. 
The present campaign, I believe, is only designed 
to train us for the duties of next summer. 
Adieu, 

Yours sincerelv, 

AN OLD FRIEND. 

Major Gen. Lee.

Nac-York, August 12&, 1776. 

My Dear Lee, 

Notwithstanding i shaii probably fed 

the effect, I do most cordially and sincerely congratulate you on your victory over Clinton and the 
British squadron at Sullivan's Island. A victory 
undoubtedly it is, when an enemy are drubbed, 
and driven from a country they were sent to conquer. Such is the case of Clinton and Sir Peter 
Parker, who are now with the fleet and army at 
Staten Island, where General Howe and the troops 
from Halifax have been ever since the last day of 
June, and Lord Howe since the twelfth of July. 
Some Hessians and a pretty many of the Scottish 
laddies have got in, and the residue of the fleet 
parted with on the banks of Newfoundland, hourly expected. When the whole arrive matters will 
soon come to a decision, every thing being prepared 
on both sides for the appeal, and, on ours, I hope it 
will be obstinate, if not successful. 

The latter, it is not in the power of mortals to 
command ; but they may endeavour to deserve it ;. 
and this I am persuaded, our troops will more than 
ever aim at, as I have impressed upon their minds 
the gallant behaviour of the brave few, who defended Sullivan's Island. 

At present the enemy can bring more men to. a point than we can, and when reinforced by the 
Hessians without number, as unless the militia (faster than heretofore) come in to our aid, their numbers, when the Hessians arrive cannot, by the best 
intelligence we can get, fall short of twenty- five 
thousand men. Ours are under twenty, very sickly, and posted on Governor's Island, Long Island, 
at Howlis Hook, Horn's Hook, and at the pass 
near King's Bridge ; more militia are expected, but 
whether thev will be in time, time onlv can tell, as 
also where the point of attack will be. An opinion prevails, countenanced by hints from some of 
the principal tories, and corroborated by intelligence from Staten Island, that part of theenemv's 
fleet and army will go into the Sound, whilst another part of it, runs up the North River, thereby 
cutting off all communication by water with this 
place, whilst their troops form a chain across the 
neck, and stop an intercourse with Connecticut by 
land : others think, they will not leave an army in 
their rear, whilst they have the country in their 
front, getting by that means between two fires, unless it is extended as a feint to withdraw our troops 
from the city, that they may slip in and possess 
themselves of it : all this is but a field of conjecture. 

Our affairs in the north have been growing from 
bad to worse, till I hope they will mend, as one 
great source of the evil is in a way of being removed, I mean, the small pox ; but the army have 
retreated from place to place, till they are now got 
to Ticonderoga, opposite to which oh the east 
side of the Lake Champlain, they are about to establish a post, which they say will be invulnerable ; 
but whether it may not be somewhat like the man 
who built a mill on account of a beautiful fall, and 
then had to consider whether it was practicable to 
bring water to it, remains in some measure to be 
determined, as it is the opinion of some, (I know 
nothing of the country myself,) that the enemy 
may pass this post and get into Lake George, without receiving the least annoyance from this work. 
Whether they would chuse to leave a post in their 
rear, without establishing one themselves, sufficient 
to keep it in awe is the point in question. 

It gives me a very singular pleasure to hear of 
the gallant behaviour of your young aids, and Mr. 
Jenefer, as also of Colonels Moultrie and Thompson, to be the means at any time, of rewarding 
merit, will add greatly to my happiness ; and 
whenever you can point out a mode that can be 
adopted consistently, you shall find me very ready : 
but you know the temper of the troops in this 
quarter, as well as I do, and how impracticable it 
is to bring in a person, let his merit be ever so 
great, without throwing a whole corps into confusion. This will also apply to Captain Bullet. What 
vacancies there may be in your department that he 
has his eye to, and could be appointed to with propriety, you must know better than I. That there 
is none here, I can undertake to say. I have no 
doubt but the Congress would annex the rank of 
colonel to his office of adjutant. I believe they 
have done it in the instance of Griffin, who is appointed deputy adjutant to the flying camp. If 
this would add any thing to his satisfaction, I should 
have no objection to the mention of it. With 
every wish for your prosperity and success, I remain with sincere regard, 

Your most affectionate and obedient, 

G. WASHINGTON* 

Gen. Lee*

Dear Sir, 

Gineral Green's Quarters, Nov. 16///, 1 T7C 

OU will see by the inclosed Resolves, that Congress have entered into some new regulations respecting the enlistment of the new army, and reprobating the measures adopted by the state of 
Massachusetts Bay for raising their quota of men. 

As every possible exertion should be used for 
recruiting the army, as speedily as may be, I request that you immediately publish, in orders, 
that an allowance of a dollar and one-third of a 
dollar will be paid to the officers for every soldier 
they shall enlist, whether in or out of camp. 

Also, that it will be optional in the soldier to 
enlist during the continuance of the war, or for 
three years, unless sooner discharged by Congress. 
In the former case, they are to receive all such 
bounty and pay as have been heretofore mentioned 
in orders ; those who engage for the latter time, 
that of three years, are not to receive the bounty 
in land. 

That no mistakes may be made, you will direct* 
the recruiting officers, from your division, to provide two distinct enlisting rolls ; one for those to 
sign who engage during the war ; the other for 
those who enlist for three years, if their service 
shall be so long required. 

I am sorry to inform you, that this day about 
twelve o'clock, the enemy made a general attack 
upon our lines about Fort Washington, which* 
having carried, the garrison retired within the 
fort. Colonel Magaw finding there was no prospect of retreating a-cross the North River, surrendered the post. We do not yet know the loss of 
killed and wounded on either side ; but I imagine 
it must have been pretty considerable, as the en^ 
gagement, at some parts of the lines, was of long 
continuance, and heavy ; neither do I know the 
terms of capitulation. The force of the garrison, before the attack, was about two thousand 
men. 

Before I left Peck's-hill, I urged to General 
Heath, the necessity of securing the pass through 
the Highlands next to the river, as well on that as 
this side, and to the forts above ; but as the preservingof these and others which lay more easterly, 
and which are equally essential, is a matter of the 
last importance, I must beg you to turn your attention that way, and to have such measures adopted for their defence as your judgment shall suggest to be necessary. I do not mean to advise 
abandoning your present post contrary to your 
own opinion, but only to mention my ideas of the 
importance of those passes, and that you cannot 
give too much attention to their security, by having works erected in the most advantageous places for that purpose. 

I am, dear Sir, 

Your most obedient Servant, 

GEORGE WASHINGTON. 
Gen. Lee.

THE RESOLVES OF CONGRESS MENTIONED IN THE 

PRECEDING LETTER. 

IN CONGRESS, Nov. 7th, 1776. 

Ke SOLVED, that the resolution passed the Uth 
of October, last, That the allowance to officers of 
one and one-third of a dollar for enlisting soldiers, 
be not extended or giving on the re-enlistment of 
the soldiers in camp, be repealed. 

Resolved, As the opinion of this Congress, 
that if the soldiers to be raised by the state of Massachusetts Bay, be enlisted on the terms offered 
to them, (which are more advantageous than what 
are offered to other soldiers serving in the same army,) it would much retard, if not totally impede, 
the enlistment of the latter, and produce discontent and murmur, unless Congress should equally 
increase the pay of these ; which it is the opinion 
of this Congress would universally be reprobated 
as an immoderate expence, and complained of, as 
a grievous burden by those who must bear it ; and 
therefore, that the committee from the state of 
Massachusetts Bay, be desired not to enlist their 
men on the additional pay offered by the Assembly 
of that state. 

Upon reconsidering the Resolution of the 16th 
of September last, for raising eighty-eight battalions, to serve during the present war with Great 
Britain, Congress being of opinion, that the readiness of the inhabitants of the states to enter into 
the service for limited times, in dell nee of their 
invaluable privileges, on all former occasions, gives 
good ground to hope the same zeal for the public 
good will appear in future when necessity calls for 
their assistance ; and the uncertain length of time 
which forces raised during the continuance of the 
war may be compelled to serve, may prevent many from enlisting who would otherwise readily 
manifest their attachment to the common cause, 
by engaging for a limited time, therefore, 

Resolved, That all non-commission officers 
and soldiers, who do not incline to engage their 
services during the continuance of the present 
war, and shall enlist to serve three years, unless sooner discharged by Congress, shall be entitled 
to, and receive, all such bounty and pay as are allowed to those who enlist during the continuance 
of the present war, except the one hundred acres 
of land which is to be granted to those only who 
enlist without limitation of time. 

And each recruiting officer is required to provide two distinct enlisting rolls ; one for such to 
sign who enlist during the continuance of the war, 
and the other for such as enlist for three years, if 
their service shall be so long required. 

By order of the Congress, 

JOHN HANCOCK, Pres.

Hackensark, Nov. 21s/, 1776, 

Dear General, 

JL HE letter you will receive with this contains my 
sentiments with respect to your present station ; 
but besides this, I have some additional reasons 
for most earnestly wishing to have you where the 
principal scene of action is laid. I do not mean 
to flatter nor praise you at the expence of any 
other, but, I confess, I do think that it is entirely 
owing to you, that this army and the liberties of 
America, so far as they are dependent on it, are 
not totally cut off. You have decision, a quality 
often wanting in minds otherwise valuable : and 
I ascribe to this our escape from York-Island, 
from King's Bridge, and the Plains; and I have 
no doubt, had you been here, the garrison of 
Mount Washington would now have composed a 
part of this army : and from all these circumstances, I confess I ardently wish to see you removed 
from a place where I think there will be little call for your judgment and experience, to the place 
where they are likely to be so necessary. Nor am 
I singular in my opinion, every gentlemen of the 
family, the officers and soldiers, generally have a 
confidence in you : the enemy constantly enquire 
where v ou are, and seem to me to be less confident when you are present. 

Colonel Cadwallader, through a special indulgence, on account of some civilities shewn by his 
familv to General Prescot, has been liberated from 
New-York without any parole. He informs, that 
the enemy have a southern expedition in view ; 
that they hold us very cheap in consequence of the 
late affair at Mount Washington, where both the 
plan of defence and execution were contemptible. 
If a real defence of the lines was intended, the 
number was too few ; if the Fort only, the garrison was too numerous by half. General Washington's own judgment, seconded by representations from us, would, I believe, have saved the men 
and their arms ; but, unluckily, General Green's 
judgment was contrary. This kept the General's 
mind in a state of suspense till the stroke was 
struck. Oh, General ! an indecisive mind is one 
of the greatest misfortunes that can befal an army : 
how often have I lamented it this campaign ! 

All circumstances considered, we are in a very 
awful, alarming state, one that requires the utmost 
wisdom and firmness of mind. 

As soon as the season will admit, I think yourself and some others should go to Congress, and 
form the plan of the new army, point out their 
defects to them, and, if possible, prevail on them 
to bind their whole attention to this great object, 
even to die exclusion of every other. If they will 
not, or cannot, do this, I fear ail our exertions 
will be vain in this part of the world. Foreign 
assistance is soliciting, but we cannot expect they 
will fight the whole battle. 

I intended to have said more, but the express 
is waiting, and I must conclude with my clear 
and explicit opinion, that your presence is of the 
last importance. 

I am, with much affection and regard, 
Your very affectionate, 
Humbie servant, 

JOSEPH REED, Adjut. Gen, 

Major Gen. Lee, at the White Plains. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

Philadelphia, Aug. 30lh, 1778. 

My dear General, 

a AM shocked, confounded, and exceedingly chagrined to hear the court have adjudged you guilty 
of all the charges alleged against you, and have 
suspended you one year on account of it. The 
sentence is as unaccountable to me, as that they 
should find you guilty. 

Matters have been so cursedly represented against 
you in this place, that I have been almost mobbed in defending you. Ten thousand infamous 
lies have been spread, that I never heard before, 
to bias the friends of the people against you. In 
the name of God, what are we come to ? — So 
much for our republicanism. 

I am beyond description unhappy, I feel for 
the injury of a man I do sincerely esteem — a man 
whose merit is so conspicuous throughout the 
world ; and more particularly for a man, who, 
if justice was to take place, and facts properly 
known, merited the thanks of the continent, for 
the transactions of that day, in a most singular manner. 

I have not been able to see Mr. Lee ; I called 
twice, but he was not at home ; to-morrow morning I shall have the pleasure, I expect, as I intend to call again. General Mifflin will be in town 
to-morrow, whom I shall likewise visit. 

My sincere affection you will ever command, 
and I shall never esteem myself so happy as when 
I can have it in my power to render you a service. 

I will in two or three days, set out for camp, in 
order to have an interview with you. 
I am, dear General, 

Yours affectionately,

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

Brunswick, Jan. 16///, 1779 

JL AM honoured with your favour of the 1 8th ult. and can assure you, that of the merit or demerit 
of your conduct in the affair of Monmouth, on the 
28th of June, I have not to this day framed any 
opinion. I have so little leisure to attend to the 
military operations of America, and am so incompetent a judge of the qualifications necessary to 
constitute the character of a general, that I make 
no judgment at all. But without admitting or 
denying that you have made greater sacrifices in 
the cause of American freedom than any officer of 
our whole army, without a single exception, and 
that it is not less certain that you have saved our 
whole army more than once from destruction, (the 
proofs of which are not in my possession,) I can 
assure you, that I heartily disapprove of ail publications containing personal reflections on the character of any gentleman, and especially on those of 
your rank, in the American army. And if what 
was represented to the public, as a mere republication of a paper formerly printed by a Virginian, 
has been, as you say, republished with many malicious alterations and additions, it is still the more 
inexcusable ; because all such alterations and additions, besides their particular malignity against 
you, (for which alone I should condemn them,) 
are an imposition upon the world ; and it must be 
considered, by every man of honour, be the legal 
construction what it will, as a downright forgery. 
I can further assure you, that I cannot but disapprove of Mr. Collins's inserting the paper you refer to in his gazette, not only because no printer 
ought to make his press a vehicle for personal slander, but because he set out with a professed declaration against diverting hispaper to such purposes, 
and has so tenaciously adhered to that maxim till 
the publication in question, as to reject, if my information be true, several pieces on account of 
the personal reflections they contained on gentlemen in the service of the enemy, and which the 
law of retaliation would clearly have warranted 
him to insert. And I must declare, in justice to 
him, and from what I personally know of his humane disposition, and his disinclination to convey 
through the channel of his press any thing injurious to the reputation of others, that I firmly believe, he has taken the paper, presented to him as 
a copy of a publication in Virginia, for a true copy. 
And it is generally supposed, by virtue of what law 
I know not, but perhaps by one as rational as that 
of deciding controversies by private combat, 
in civil communities which reprobate that mode 
of decision, that a printer, by the bare republication of a paper, is not presumed to adopt the sentiments ; and that, by disclosing to the party aggrieved, at whose instance it was republished, he 
always averts the indignation of the sufferer fro^n 
himself to that person. I should, however, be 
very sorry to find any of our printers imitate the 
practice of the British subjects in New-York, who 
whether they excel us in military discipline and 
courage or not, have, to my certain knowledge, 
hitherto surpassed us in printed calumny and detraction. 

From these my sentiments respecting the printers 
of defamatory papers, I hope, sir, you will not 
question my disapprobation both of the original 
authors, and the secondary propagators, of slander. 
But neither Mr. Boudinot's appointment to, nor 
deposition from, his office, as commissary of our 
state prisoners, being in my department, it is not 
in my power to do you the justice which you seem 
to expect in that line ; nor is there any authority 
in this state by which he can be cashiered, till the 
next meeting of our assemblv, which stands adjourned to the 19th of May. But the law of the 
state is always at every one's service ; and, in the 
case of libels, if we are to credit the British lawyers, so peculiarly favourable to the prosecutor, 
that the scandal is not the less penal for being true, 
than if it was utterly false ; which, I think, is giving a man as great a chance as can reasonably be 
desired ; and, perhaps, if you thought proper to 
publish your letter to me on the subject under consideration, it would be as ample satisfaction against 
Mr. Boudinot, as the nature of the offence requires; 
but that I entirely submit to your better judgment. In a word, sir, whenever it shall be pointed out to me in what manner I can, with any propriety, interfere in the matter, either as governor of 
this state, or as a private gentleman, I shall not 
hesitate a moment to do you all the justice which I 
conceive you deserve. In the mean time, I embrace this opportunity to re-acknowledge my 
grateful sense of your friendly intimations, some 
time since, of the enemy's peculiar resentment 
against me, and your kind concern for my personal 
safety upon that account. I must, however, take 
the liberty to say, as a man detached from all parties, and wholly devoted to what he thinks the true 
interests of his country, that I should be extremely unhappy in having reason to believe what is 
frequently, and perhaps injuriously, reported of 
you, that you endeavoured to lessen the estimation 
in which General Washington is held by the most 
virtuous citizens of America ; and which estimation, not, sir, from a blind attachment to men of 
high rank, nor from any self-interested motive 
whatsoever, but from a full conviction of his great 
personal merit and public importance, I deem it 
my dut} r to my country to use my utmost influence 
to support. 

I am, with all due respect, 
Sir, 
Your most humble servant, 
Major Gen. Lee. W. LIVINGSTON.

Philadelphia, Oct. U, 1779, 
Mr dear Friend, 

A AM distressed to think that all your friendly 
letters and messages to me have met with such ungrateful returns. I have written two letters to you, 
one of which was inclosed under a cover, directed 
to Mr. Wolford, and put into the Post Office ; 
the other was mislaid and lost before I could hear 
of an opportunity of sending it. You see from 
this, that I have not been unmindful of vou. You 
have wounded me in supposing that I am carried 
away by the tide of the times. I would as soon be suspected of picking a pocket, as of infidelity in friendship, or idolatry in politics. 

Major Eustace informed me of your reply to 
President Reed's publications. Our printers refused to give it a place in their papers : it was best 
for you they did so. Have patience ; time and 
posterity will do you justice. The summer flies 
that now din our ears must soon retire. Nothing 
but virtue and real abilities will finally pass muster, 
when the public cool a little from the ferment into 
which the sjcat and sudden events of the late revolution have thrown us. I would rather be one of 
your dogs in a future history of the present war, 
than possess the first honours that are now current 
in America, with the characters which I know 
some of our great men merit. Poor Pennsylvania 
has become the most miserable spot upon the surface of the globe. Our streets, alas ! have been 
stained already with fraternal blood ; a sad prelude, 
we fear, of the future mischiefs our constitution 
will bring upon us; they call it a democracy, a mobocracy in my opinion would be more proper. All 
our laws breathe the spirit of town meetings and 
porter shops : but I forget that I am not safe in 
communicating my opinion of men and measures 
to paper. Oh, Liberty ! Liberty ! I have worshipped thee as a substance! — But — it is near twelve 
o'clock at night, and I am much fatigued with an 
unusual share of business ; for in the true stile of 
the subject of a monarch, my family and my business now engross all my time and attention — my 
country I have long ago left to the care of Timothy Matlock, Charles Wilson Peale, and Co. I 
must therefore bid you good night, wishing you 
at the sam' time all possible health and happiness,

York-town, Oct. 21a/, 17CJ 

Msr dear Lee, 

HERE are few circumstances that give me 
equal pleasure to that of hearing from my friends ; 
and, as my esteem for you has ever encreased in 
proportion to your misfortunes in the road of persecution, I am always made happy in a line from 
you, as it announces your present situation. 

Your being robbed of your horses is a common 
evil, and its falling harder on you than any other 
person is what I should have expected, from the 
disposition of wretches always disposed to heap 
coals on the head of the injured. I am happy ever 
in having it in my power to inform you of the good 
esteem in which you are held in the army ; and 
that they are not now, whatever they have been, inclined to pursue the track of persecution, beaten 
so bare as it is by creatures whose praise would be 
a dishonour to any honest man. 

PoorFleury, the other day, calledmea one-side 
to whisper to me, and after looking round, to prevent a possibility of being over-heard, he asked 
me what had become of you ? I could not help 
smiling, and in my reply, telling him you was very well, and that he need not be afraid of acknowledging an acquaintance with General Lee in the 
most public assembly in America ; that I esteemed it an honour to call myself his friend ; that my 
sincere attachment to him was amply rewarded by 
the universal approbation of all good and sensible 
men. He answered me, he was very glad of it : 
it was every where known in France that you had 
been ill-treated, and that every person lamented 
your misfortune. 

The surrender of Lord Cornwallis and his army will reach you before this letter. I think this 
is a circumstance which must secure to America 
her independence. What will follow, I leave to 
time. I f . must have been a mortifying circumstance to my lord, to have solicited terms, as no 
demand of a surrender was made. We had just 
completed our second parallel, at two hundred 
yards from his main works. In the capsulation 
he was not permitted to uncase his colours, or to 
beat an American or French march. You will 
probably see your friend O'Hara, who is a prisoner. 

We expect now to go on to Charles Town, to 
invest that place. The moment I can obtain permission to leave the army, I will repair to your 
hermitage, and spend some time with you, when 
I promise myself much satisfaction. In the mean 
while, believe me, 

Your affectionate and 

Unalterable friend, 

E. EDWARDS. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER--><-Letters from Charles Lee->

Ixtndon, Dec. 1st, 1766. 

Most excellent Sir, and most dear Master, 

A OUR Majesty will better imagine, than I can 
express the pleasure I have received from your 
kind and gracious letter : the assurances it gives 
me of your good opinion and regard, I shall 
ever consider as the happiest, the most honourable 
circumstance of my life. They make ample 
amends for the enmities I have drawn upon myself from certain powerful quarters in my own 
country, where, perhaps, from some just judgment 
of God, the same qualities which would recommend to your Majesty are highly obnoxious. I 
devoutly wish, and 8 proudly hope, for my own 
honour, that I may ever possess a place in the 
esteem of your Majesty, and remain the aversion of 
those who so widely, so totally, differ from you. 
I am concerned I cannot more fully, and in a 
more satisfactory manner, answer the several questions of your Majesty on the state of our country, 
than what I am able to do. Of some of these articles, 
the cause, though generally treated of, appears not 
in the least understood ; on others, opinions are 
so various that it is presumption to decide ; but 
some are, I think obvious to every man of common understanding ; and of this class may be 
reckoned Mr. Pitt's quitting the stage and the conduct of the American colonies towards the mother 
country. With respect to the first, it is manifest, 
from a thousand circumstances, that with the 
health and frame of this extraordinary man, the 
understanding is likewise worn out. Before I 
came to England, I did not lay much stress on 
those parts of his conduct which the newspapers 
have so worried ; and I recollect your Majesty 
was of the same way of thinking, that there 
was nothing very monstrous in his acceptance 
of a peerage, but that it might be imprudent, 
and argued a senselessness of glory, to forfeit the 
name of Pitt for any title the king could bestow. 
But since lam a little more behind the scenes, and 
am made acquainted with several circumstances 
previous, concomitant, and subsequent to this 
event, I am apt to agree with the majority of the 
better sort, that this once noble mind is quite 
overthrown. Can it be reconciled to reason, that 
the same man who had rendered his name so illustrious and so tremendous to the greatest part of the 
globe, should split upon ribbons and titles ; that 
when he had arrived at a higher pinnacle of glory 
than ever citizen did since the days of Epaminondas, he should be captivated by such a bauble, 
even though it should be attended with no ill consequences to the affairs of his country ? but when 
such terrible ones were visible, it must be construed downright madness. Mr. Pitt, say they, was 
the only man who had capacity, spirit, and power 
to assert the honour and interest of the nation 
with foreign states, correct the abuses, and stem 
the torrent of corruption at home. His power 
was not founded on vast property or cabinet favour, but on his popularity. By sinking into a 
peerage, his popularity would vanish of course, 
and with it all power of rendering, at a most critical time, any farther services to his country. If 
it is objected that it is possible to accept a title 
and retain the integrity of the citizen, they allow 
it ; but that, unfortunately, the bulk of the people 
will not be persuaded of it ; that a popular minister must, therefore, not only be strictly virtuous, 
but, like Caesar's wife, his virtue must not be 
suspected ; that this persuasion of the people, ridiculous as it may appear at first sight, is founded on too much justice ; for they observe, that, 
from the time of Went worth down to that of Pulteney, not one instance can be produced of a man's 
changing his seat from the lower to the upper 
house, without a thorough renunciation of all 
principles and public virtue ; but whether this 
opinion is well or ill founded, as it is a prevalent 
one, this revolt, error, folly, or madness, of such 
a man has some direful effects ; it taints with jealousy all public affiance, establishes a doubt, whether such a thing as public virtue can exist : in short, 
it makes the bulk of mankind indifferent who are 
in, who are out, as they are almost persuaded that 
all men are, or will prove, in the end, equally vain, 
apostates to the common cause, either through interestedness, vanity, or madness. 

Such are the arguments not only made use of 
by the majority of Mr. Pitt's once admirers, but 
they were stated to him by those who were supposed to have the greatest weight with him. Lord 
Camden, in particular, concluding this resolution 
to be a short fit of compliance, and that his friend Cy* 
would soon see the danger of the measure, delay- 4*-*/ 
ed the signing of the patent for two days. But *• • * 
his lordship was mistaken, the disorder had taken 
deeper root than he imagined ; no girl could shew 
more impatience for a new toy, than this first of 
men did, till the testimony of his folly was signed 
and sealed to the whole world. Your Majesty will probably object, that though Mr. Pitt played the 
child in one article, it is no proof of the general 
failure of his understanding ; that no man was ever blessed with so entire faculties, as not, on some 
particular occasion, and in some unlucky moment, 
to betray weakness. But this is not the case with 
Pitt, the decay of his parts is not only indicated 
by the act itself, but confirmed by his conduct in 
public and private character : In public the doctrines he broaches are diametrically the reverse of 
what he has, through the whole course of his life, 
asserted : In private, he is totally metamorphosed; 
' Trom the extreme of plainness and simplicity, he 
is all parade, magnificence and ostentation. But 
I might have spared your Majesty this prolix detail, when in few words, it would have sufficed to 
have said, that he has fits of crying, starting, and 
every effect of hysteric ; it is affirmed, indeed, 
that ten years ago, he was in the very same condition, that therefore a possibility of his recovering 
once more his nerves, and with them all his functions ; but from the age of the man, the generality consider the piece as finished ; the honest and 
well-wishers of their country lament over him, 
the corrupt and profligate sing Te Deum, as the 
Devil probably did for the fall of man. Your 
Majesty asks who is to mount the stage in his 
room ? I am so far from seeing any man so qualified in all points, as to fill his part in time of distraction and confusion, that I know no set of men 
who have a chance of being called to it, who will 
not by ignorance, obstinacy, or timidity, throw 
things into ten times greater confusion than they 
are at present. My Lord Rockingham is indeed 
an honest, worthy, and spirited man, and possesses 
the good opinion of the people in general, but 
these attributes will probably exclude him. The 
Thane who is still all-powerful, will never admit 
of a man so endowed. He requires a certain degree of subserviency and complaisance ; in short, 
he requires a minister of his own jobs and partialities, and not an administrator of the national 
affairs. As to the rest who form what is called the 
opposition, they are so odious, or contemptible, 
that the favourite himself is preferable to them ; 
such as Grenville, Bedford, Newcastle, and their 
associates. Temple is one of the most ridiculous 
order of coxcombs I ever heard of, he is eternally appealing to the public, forgetting that the 
public never considered him farther than they 
would an old pair of boots, which Mr. Pitt might, 
through whim, have set a value upon, which when 
he chose to throw aside, it mattered not if they 
were thrown into a lumber room or the fire. Nothing could make the American colonists cast off 
their obedience, or even respect to their mother 
country, but some attempt on the essence of their 
liberty ; such as undoubtedly the stamp act was, 
which, if it had remained unrepealed, and admitted as a precedent, they would have been slaves to 
all intents and purposes, as their whole property 
would lie at the mercy of the Crown's minister 
and the minister's ministers, the House of Commons, who would find no end to the necessity- of 
taxing these people, as every additional tax would 
furnish the master with means of adding to their 
respective wages ; but it would be impertinent in 
me to enter into a discussion of the propriety or 
impropriety, the justice or injustice, of this measure, when it is so fullv and clearlv treated in some 
tracts which are bound up together, and which I 
have ordered to be sent to your Majesty. If the 
humours which this accursed attempt has raised, 
are suffered to subside, the inherent affection which ihc colonics have for their mother^ country, and 
clashings of interests one amongst another, will 
throw every thing back into the old channel ; which 
indeed is the case already : but if another attack 
of the same nature should be made upon them, bv 
a wicked blundering minister, I will venture to 
prophecy, that this country will be shaken to its 
foundation in its wealth, credit, naval force, and 
interior population.

London, Dec. -.">//*, 1706. 

My dfar Prince, 

OU will do me great injustice if you attribute 
my silence for so many months to a want of sense 
of your excessive goodness and friendship, or even 
to carelessness, which, considering the obligations 
J lie under to your highness, would be one and the 
same thing. The truth is, that I was unwilling to 
trouble you with a fulsome letter of acknowledgements, as I hope you are no stranger to my sentiments on the subject ; but I thought a few lines 
which would give you a sketch of the state of 
this country, of the parties, and of our prospect 
in relation to foreign and interior affairs, would be 
the only possible method of making your Highness some return for the thousand instances of 
friendship which I have received at your hands ; 
but the most reasonable schemes are frequently defeated : so it fares with me ; for although I have 
been in London eight days, which, in this political 
and communicative town is sufficient, one should 
think, to make a man master of every thing necessary to be known ; but my evil stars have disappointed me, and your evil stars have dictated to 
me, that, notwithstanding the insignificancy of all 
I have to say, it would be a petty treason to remain 
any longer silent. You must therefore accept the 
will for the deed ; in a few posts I hope to be able 
to amuse you better. The king and his ministers 
are out of town, or more properly, I should have said 
the ministers and their king, for I do not find that 
the latter is any more a principal than when I left 
England. Lord Chatham is supposed to be absolute in all affairs which concern the state ; Bute in 
his corner, retains influence to a sufficient degree, 
for the provision of his creatures and countrymen, 
in subordinate offices ; he disclaims all concern 
with business ; but this is like the rest of his conduct a most impudent and ineffectual hypocrisy ; 
for he is as usual, not credited. A formidable opposition is expected, but the conjectures on its success are too vague to be attended to. Some men 
of weight and reputation are embarked in it ; but 
the heads are too odious to the nation in general 
in my opinion, to carry their point. Such as Bedford, Sandwich, G. Grenville, and, with submission, your friend Mansfield. He lately drew upon himself the laugh of the House of Lords, making use of the word Liberty of the Subject ; and 
expressing great regard to it, it was called Satan 
preaching up sanctity. Conway is still secretary 
of state, and jnuch regarded as a man of ability 
and integrity. Lord Shelburne, the other secretary, has surpassed the opinion of the world ; he 
speaks well, and is very distinct in office. The 
Duke of Grafton is an absolute orator, and has a 
fair character. An Irishman, one Mr. Burke, is 
sprung up in the House of Commons, who has 
astonished every body with the power of his eloquence, his comprehensive knowledge in all oun 
exterior and internal politics and commercial interests. He wants nothing but that sort of dignity 
annexed to rank, and property in England, to 
make him the most considerable man in the Lower 
House. 

A dispute with Portugal, on some commercial 
points, seems at present chiefly to occupy the 
thoughts of the ministry. It is thought, that an 
embassador extraordinary, with an escort of ten 
ships of war, which is the best ultima ratio, will be 
sent to Lisbon. I have had some conversation 
with our ministry on the affairs of Poland ; but 
as this letter goes by the common post, I cannot 
send you the particulars. The character of his 
Majesty is high in their esteem. I intreat your 
Highness to present my duty to him, to assure him 
of my zeal, veneration, and love ; in a few days, 
I shall take the liberty of writing to him, or to 
Mr. Ogroudski. I wait till I have had a conversation with the King. Could your Highness procure me a copy of his Majesty's picture, either in 
miniature, or otherwise ; I ask for a copy, as I 
would not presume to trouble him to sit. You 
would likewise make me very happy with your 
own. I was much pleased with an acquaintance 
with Lavisa at the Hague. His warm attachment 
to our incomparable master has much endeared 
him to me. We have some books published here, 
which I fancy you would be glad to have, particularly, the whole letters of Swift. The)' are the 
best history of those times, and read with great avidity. When the Baltic is open, I shall send to his 
Majesty a considerable number, as he has done me 
the honour to trust to my judgment, and drawn 
on Mr. Tipper for the cost. 

I have not heard from our friend Lind ; I beg 
you will chide him for this abominable neglect. 
Wroughton too deserves abuse ; I shall write to 
him in a few posts. The reason of Lord Thanet's 
delay in regard to the horse, was delicacy. He 
could not find any he thought good enough ; 
but in the spring he will send a couple, which 
will, in all respects, suit his Majesty. 

I entreat you, my dear prince, to pay my humble respects to your father, mother, the prince, 
chancellor, and all your house, to which I have 
so great obligations, and for which I have a 
sincere love and honour, and that you will steal 
a few moments to give me under your hand what 
I am already convinced of, that I possess some 
share of your love and friendship. 

I am, with the most respectful sentiments, 
My dear Prince, ever yours, 

CHARLES LEE,

Warsaic, May iit 1 176T. 

My ijear Colekak, 

OU must undoubtedly think me a very extraordinary person, that, on a slender acquaintance, 
I should have saddled you with the curation of my 
affairs, and afterwards not think it worth my 
while to write you even a civil note, such as a 
common acquaintance, who had conferred no obligation, might have expected. The truth is ? 
I have every day expected to be ascertained of 
my destiny r and then intended to have given you 
a circumstantial plan of my operations ; but as 
this day is as remote, in all appearance, as ever, 
I should be gulity of a monstrous neglect, in any 
farther delaying, to pay the tribute of friendship 
which I so sensibly owe. Believe me, my dear 
Sir, that I most sincerely love and honour you ; and 
this love and honour is founded on so solid a basis, 
that I have dared to neglect a form which w r ould 
not be pardoned by a person who is not really 
an object of esteem. 

1 have been in this place two months waiting 
for an opportunity to join the Russian army, and 
I am afraid I shall be obliged to wait a month 
longer. The communications are so filled with the 
offals of the confederates, who are themselves 
a banditti, that it is impossible to stir ten yards 
without an escort of Russians : the English arc 
less secure than others, as they are esteemed the 
arch-enemies of the holy faith. A French comedian was the other day near being hanged from the 
circumstance of his wearing a bob-wig, which by 
the confederates, is supposed to be the uniform of 
the English nation. I wish to God the three 
branches of our legislature would take it into their 
heads to travel through the woods of Poland in 
bob-wigs. 

The first opportunity that will offer will be the 
present embassador, who, it is said, will now be 
succeeded in ten days ; but this has been so long 
said, that I begin to despair of any opportunity at 
all; if none should offer, I have made a wise journey of it : I believe it would break my heart. I 
have an unspeakable curiosity of seeing this campaign, though, in fact, I believe it will be a ridiculous one ; if not like that of Harlequin and Seapin, it will resemble the battle of Wilks and Talbot. The Russians can gain nothing by beating 
their enemy, and the Turks are confoundedly 
afraid. I wish, by practice, to make myself a soldier for purposes honest, but which I shall not 
mention. If I am defeated in my intention of 
joining the Russians, I think of passing through 
Hungary, and spending the ensuing winter in the 
south of Italy, Sicily, or some oi the islands in 
the iEgean sea. As you are a scholar I venture 
to talk this cant. As to England, I am resolved 
not to set my foot in it, till the vitrue which I believe to exist in the body of the people can be put 
into motion. I have good reasons for it. My 
spirits and temper were much affected by the measures which I was witness of, measures absolutely 
moderate, laudable, and virtuous, in comparison 
of what has been transacted since. To return solemn thanks to the Crown for the manifestly corrupt dissipation of its enormous revenues and impudent demand on the people ; to repair this dissipation, to complete their own ruin, is pushing 
servility farther than the rascally senate of Tiberias was guilty of. In this light it is considered 
by all those I converse with, of every nation, even 
those who have the least idea of liberty. The 
Austrians and Russians hoot at us. In fine, it is 
looked upon as the ultimatum of human baseness, 
a coup de grace to our freedom and national honour. 

You will say, it is being a pleasant correspondent, giving you my comments on what passes under your own eyes, and being entirely silent on the 
transactions of this country, which you may be 
supposed to have some curiosity of being acquainted with. You will not think me serious when I 
assure you, that I am as totally a stranger to them 
as yourself or any man in England. Humphrey 
Gates, I am sure, must know fifty times more of 
the matter. I see that the country is in one general state of confusion, filled with devastation and 
murder. I hear every day of the Russians beating the Confederates ; but as to what the Russians, 
what the Confederates, what the body of the nation propose, I am utterly ignorant, though no 
more, I believe, than they are themselves. Their 
method of carrying on the war is equally gentle 
with what our*s was in North America ; the Confederates hang up all the Russians who fall into 
their hands, and the Russians put to the sword the 
Confederates. The Russian Cossacks have an admirable sang frokl in these executions. The 
other day, at a place called Rava, forty or fifty 
Confederates were condemned to the bayonet ; but 
as they were tolerably dressed, they were obliged 
to strip for the ceremony, the Cossacks chusing 
not to make any holes in their clothes. The situation of the K is really to be lamented, notwithstanding he wears a crown. He is an honest, 
virtuous man, and a friend to the rights of mankind. I wish we could persuade a prince of my 
acquaintance, who is taught, (as for as he can be 
taught any thing,) to hate them, to exchange with 
him. I know a nation that could spare a whole family, mother, and all to the Poles, and only take in 
exchange this one man. I could say many things 
on this subject, digna lit eras nostris, seel non committenda ejusmodi pericido, tit aut interire, aut 
aperiri, aut inter dpi possint. 

I hope your kindness has not entailed any trouble upon you with respect to my affairs. I hope 
Mr. Ayre has been punctual in his payment. 1 
wrote to him from London, acquainting him with 
your powers. If you should pass by Mr. Hoares, 
I beg you will tell him, that I wrote to him from 
Munich, requesting him to send me, if possible, a 
letter of credit to Warsaw, and to give credit to a 
Captain William Spey, for surveying my land in 
St. John's. How does the hallowed Juliet ? It is 
inconceivable how deeply I am interested for the 
success and welfare of that girl. If she does not 
succeed, let her marry me, and settle in America, 
My respects to Mrs.' Coleman, and that, 
I am, most sincerely, 

Dear Coleman, 
With the warmest affection, &c. 
P. S. Mv love to Rice, that when he can find 
time and matter I wish he would write. What 
will give me the greatest pleasure is to hear of his 
being married to the widow Wales, or to any good 
party. He is the only fine gentleman I ever loved. 
Direct to me Chez le Prince General de Pcdjlia, 
Varsovia, Let your letters be as long as possioie, 
and let them have in them as much of Juliet as 
possible.

Warsaw, May Id, 1767. 

Dear Madam, 

X SHOULD write to you with more ease and 
pleasure, had you not given me to understand 
that you looked upon me as an able letter- writer. 
The ambition of coming up to your expectations 
lays me under a constraint which will enevitably 
make me fall short of every correspondent. To 
render mvself tolerable I must endeavour to forget your sex, your beauty ; but above all, the 
high opinion which you are pleased to conceive 
of my talents in this article. That I may not run 
into compliment, that I may divest myself of awe 
and vanity : the first you would despise as fulsome, and the second and last would be productive 
of reserve and petulance. 

Your understanding and the care you have taken to cultivate it, cuts me off from some of the 
most fruitful subjects to female correspondents ; 
the dress, intrigues, and diversions of the women 
in the several places we pass through ; but, on 
the other hand, it affords me ample liberty of 
pouring out my mind upon subjects which, unfortunately for my own ease, engross it entirely ; 
the dreadful situation of all the honest part of mankind, and particularly of our own country. How 
miserably fallen she is in the eyes of every state ! 
How sunk are we (in a few months I may say) 
from the summit of glory, opulence, and strength, 
to the lowest degree of poverty, imbecillity, and 
contempt. Europe is astonished at the rapidity of 
the change ; high and low, men of every order, 
from the ministers of state to the political barbers, 
make it the subject of their admiration. How can 
it happen, say they, that Great Britain, so lately 
the mistress of the globe, with America in one 
hand, Asia and Africa in another, instead of the 
glorious task of giving laws and peace to nations, 
protecting the weak and injured, checking the 
powerful and oppressive, should employ her time 
in trampling on the rights of her dependencies, 
and violating her own sacred laws, on which her 
superiority over her neighbours is founded ? It 
was some consolation, say they, for the generous 
few of the Romans who survived the liberties of 
their country, that it was a Julius Caesar, a man 
with more than mortal talents, who was their 
subverter ; and the patriots of England had some 
mitigation for their spleen, that it was a Cromwell who had over-reached them ; but that 
#*■***.*** 

should be able to encompass the enslaving of a 
spirited nation, whose every law seems dictated 
by Liberty herself, is too much to bear. They 
compare the noble remonstrances of the French 
parliaments against the oppressions of their court, 
with the slavish addresses of ours. I must confess, 
that instead of sending for cooks and hair-dressers 
from that country, I have long wished that we 
were to supply ourselves with members of parliament. What it will come to, I know not, but it is 
time something should be done, and I flatter myself it will : there is much spirit in the body of 
the people ; but I will endeavour to quit this subject ; it makes me mad. 

This country is the reverse of ours ; they have an honest, patriot k g, but a vicious nation. 

If God delights in seeing a virtuous man (as Seneca supposes he does) struggling with adversities, he has a charming spectacle in the king of 
Poland: and I hope God will, in the end, recompense the instrument of his pleasure, by extricating him out of his distresses ; nothing else can, 
I am sure. You must excuse me entering into a 
detail of these difficulties, as this letter may possiblv fall into the hands of the Confederates, and 
be published to the nation, as several others, full 
as insignificant, have already been, to the no small 
detriment of this good man's affairs. I shall reserve them for some future letter, or our evenings 
chat in Queen Anne Street, or Langham. 

Our station here, I mean those who are about 
the king's person, is whimsical enough. We 
have few troops, the bulk of these totally disaffected, and the town is full of (though not declared, far from being concealed) Confederates. — 
We have frequent alarms, and the pleasure of 
sleeping every night with our pistols on our pillows. I at present only wait for an opportunity 
to join the Russian army : this does not offer every day, as a strong escort is necessary, the communications being filled with banditties of robbers, 
who are the offals of the Confederates. I believe 
it will be but a ridiculous campaign, something 
like that of Wilks and Talbot. The Russians 
can gain nothing by beating their enemy, and the 
Turks are confoundedly afraid. 

I have heard of Lady S h's flight. I cannot say I ever liked the match. It is impossible 
to have the least connection with Fox, either of a 
political or a private nature, without smarting 
for it : every thing he touches becomes putrid 
and prostitute. I hope your brother will have 
the grace to break this accursed connection, which 
has diverted such excellent parts from their true 
use, blasted all the hopes which his real friends 
and his country had a right to entertain of him ; 
that he will see, in its proper colours, the odiousness of dependency and venality, particularly in 
a man of fortune; and that he may, by his future 
conduct, make an ample recompense to the opulent county which has chose him for their hither
to disappointment. I am convinced you will not 
think what I am saying as too great a liberty with 
your brother; I am convinced your sentiments 
correspond with mine ; if I thought they did not, 
I solemnly deciare, were your beauty and understanding greater than they are, I would not write 
to you. I have no doubt of Mr. Blake's doing 
his duty. He is not only well-disposed himself, 
but in the hands of one who might transform a 
Maccaroni into a Cato. He must be the devil 
himself whom a young, beautiful, English woman, 
with the sentiments of a Spartan matron, cannot 
lead into the ways of political righteousness. If 
women in general were like you, men could not 
possibly be such rascals. I have long lamented 
the accursed prevailing notion that women ought 
to have defective educations. It was the most 
cunning fiend in hell who first broached this doctrine ; which, had it not prevailed, the better 
part of the globe would not have gi oaned in the 
wretched state of slavery we at present see it. 
For God's sake, Madam, have as many daughters 
as possible, and make them as much like yourself 
as possible, and some descendant of Catherine 
M'Cauley may attribute the salvation of the state 
to your progeny. 

I am, dear Madam, with the highest esteem, 

Yours, &x.

Warsaw, May llh, 1767., 

Dear Louisa, 

t? HEN you first requested me to give you lessons in English, I esteemed myself happy to demonstrate my gratitude to Madam Kreithin for 
her singular kindness to me. I have been so 
used to con vers with myself and a few favourite books, that I never found it necessary to attend the toilets of women, merely as the generality do, to fly from themselves, and kill the time 
which they have no other means of employing. 
This was m) r original motive ; but on one or 
two conversations with my scholar, I entertained 
a sort of ambition of adding something to the 
means of enlightening so excellent an understanding as I perceived her to be possessed of. A 
little knowledge of the English language I conceived to be one of the means, as it abounds with so 
many excellent and instructing books. For a few 
days my views were confined to this ; but, O Louisa ! you ought, you must,have seen this ambition 
giving place to another less tranquil sentiment. 
Why did you not check it in its birth, by affecting to find difficulties in the task you had undertaken ? Why did you not, on some such humane 
pretext, remove me from your side before the 
flame had acquiredsuch inextinguishablefierceness? 
This you should in charity have. done, as you 
was determined to treat me as an enemy the 

y 
moment I declared I loved. Your resentment at 
my pretending to more than common friendship, 
is futile and vain, or, what is worse, hypocritical 
and deceitful. You know your own charms, your 
own powers too well. You have proved them 
with an unhappy success on several, not to be conscious that it is impossible to see you often, and 
to hear your voice, without being forced beyond 
the bounds of friendship. But, to speak proudly, I do not see why the declaration of my passion should so heniously offend you. To inspire 
you with an equal passion for an object destitute 
of any kind of charm, would be ridiculous presumption: and were I furnished with every charm 
that could captivate womankind, to entertain any 
hopes which might affect your happiness, or reputation, would be the highesjt villainy ; but as 
I am born of a reputable family, I hope my character is rather a fair one ; and as my fortune is 
sufficiently ample to make an honest man independent and an honest woman content, 1 cannot see 
the mighty crime in wishing to unite your fortune with mine. I had flattered myself, that time 
and an unwearied attention to please, would have 
supplied in me what you might find amiss in my 
person or the arts of conversation. 

I am, dear Louisa, with much esteem, 

Yours, &c.

My dear Lord, 

WROTE a sort of scrap of a note to you by 
the hands of Fawkner, and flattered myself that I 
should have found at this place a scrap in return, I know your indolence too well, to except a letter 
of a sheet of paper, and do not exact it; but if 
you knew how much pleasure a scrap signed by 
your hand, certifying your health, welfare, and 
good spirits affords me, I am confident you would 
from time to time muster up resolution, to write 
me a few lines, three will be sufficient, which I insist on, as a tribute due to friendship, which on my 
side I can affirm to be as pure and genuine as the 
spawn of such a rascally planet as this is capable 
of; and I have the strongest reason to think it is 
not less so on yours. I must therefore repeat it, 
that I expect a tribute of this sort every fifth or 
sixth post. I have been in this happy capital five 
weeks, waiting for an opportunity to join the Russian army, which does not offer every day, for the 
communications are filled by a set of gentlemen 
who are called Confederates, but why or wherefore 
they are pleased to stile themselves Confederates, I 
cannot find out. They give no reasons, they propose no plan, but they rob, strip, and generally 
murder every body who fall into their hands. 

You used to dine formerly with very knowing, wise 
politicans, such as Hans, Stanley, and others, who are 
acquainted with all the schemes of all the nations, 
and all the individuals in Europe ; I would request 
you, to give me some hints of what these worthies 
intend : You will scarcely believe me serious, but 
I do assure you, that I knew, before I left London, 
the state of this country, full as well, if not better 
than I do here on the spot. If Gates is in the way 
you will much oblige me in procuring his opinion. I have greater reason every day to congratulate my prudence in having left England ; I am 
persuaded, had I stayed, I should have brought 
myself into some cursed scrape ; even here, at so 
great a distance, I am thrown into strange agitations 
of passion on the sight of every newspaper. Heavenly God! is it possible we should be so far sunk? 
to return solemn thanks for a manifestly corrupt 
dissipation of such enormous revenues, and an impudent demand on the public to repair this dissipation > is pushing servility to its ultimatum. Those 
nations who have the least idea of liberty, as the 
Austrians and Russians, laugh and hoot at us ; 
compare, say they, the remonstrances of the French 
parliaments with the addresses of yours, and then, 
dare to pride yourselves in the superiority of British spirit over their neighbours. It is impossible 
to make the Loast reply to these charge^, Ichoak with 
grief and indignation. When I attempt to assure 
them that the body of the nation is still untainted, 
that they have still sentiments of freedom ; they 
answer, that such sentiments are of little consequence, when courage is wanting to put them in 
motion. Is not every of your most boasted laws 
trampled upon, or eluded ? Is not perjury, desolation, and murder, encouraged and rewarded 
with the national money ? Are not your magistrates, from the sole merit of being declared enemies of the law, become factious partizans ? Is 
not the choice of your people in their representatives, treated with contempt and annulled? Are 
not your citizens massacred in the public streets 
and in the arms of their household gods by the 
military, and the military thanked for theirfriendlike alertness? If these things are borne with by 
a people, who possess sentiments of liberty, we 
have lost the meaning of words. Such, my dear 
Lord, is the language of these people, and it is fortunate for me, that they are ignorant of the state 
of our American politics. They can have no idea 
of our carrying our abominations so far, as to disfranchise three millions of people of all the rights 
of men, for the gratification of the revenge of a 
blundering knavish Secretary, and a scoundrel 
Attorney General, a Hillsborough, and a Barnard. 
Were they informed of these facts their opinion 
of us would be still more mortifying. I had the 
other day a conversation with the gentleman to 
whom you gave the horse ; he laments, with great 
energy, the weak and wicked conduct of our administration, not only on our own account, but on 
that of all Europe. He says, did they barely pos 
sess common sense, and common honesty, Great 
Britain must have been the Empress of the World ; 
that she might have kept on the muzzles of the 
dogs of war, which must now inevitably be slipped off, to the devastation of the greater part of the 
globe. He desires his respects to you, and thanks 
you again and again for the horse which turns out 
nobly. I beg my compliments to Lady Thanet, 
and was in hopes to have heard that she had before 
this, produced you a son. Adieu, my dear Lord, 
and write soon a few lines to one who sincerelv 
loves you.

scribble to your Majesty. As it is in English, I am 
in hopes no bad consequences can arise, if it falls 
into the hands of the Confederates. Your Majestv 
will have heard of our retreat— a thousand reasons 
will undoubtedly be given, and probably not one 
founded in justice; I must, it is my duty, to speak 
freely to your Majesty. The operations have been miserably concluded; they opened with a capital 
defect — without a certainty of the state of the 
place, (Chotzim,) they were destined to attack it ; 
they with infinite fatigue and expence marched to 
the certain, (in idea,) reduction of it, without the 
possible means of reducing it. Chotzim is perhaps as secure from assult, as any fortress in the 
universe ; but must inevitably be taken, when attacked with the necessary quantity of battering 
artillery, in forty hours. The hopes of reducing 
it, with our pop guns soon appeared vain ; it was 
then seemin^lv determined to blockade it, but the 
line of blockade was either broken in part, or totally taken away on every alarm. When the 
blockade was formed, the grand Vizier was expected with an hundred and fifty thousand men. If 
that number was formidable, they ought not to 
have formed the blockade, but retired at once over 
the Niester, without harassing for no purpose, their 
men and their horses. If it was not formidable, 
they ought to have persisted in the blockade. In 
fact, the Russian army, I mean the infantry, brave 
as it is, , was not sufficient in number to form a 
line complete of circumvallation, against so numerous an enemy ; but neither the marching without 
battering cannon, the blockading the place without 
a resolution to persist in it, nor any blunder committed, are so liable to censure, as the neglect to 
attack them in their camp. If success in war can 
be assured, ours was certainly so. 

I am, 
\V itb the highest respect and attachment, 
Your Majesty's most obedient and 
humble servant, 

CHARLES LEE.

My DEAR Da VERS, 

THOUGH I have been a long time in answering your letter, I beg you will not conclude, that 
the pleasure I received from it, is but small. Believe me, that every fresh assurance of your friendship gives me unspeakable satisfaction, though I 
have no need of fresh assurances to be convinced 
of it. The longer I live, my love for you, acquires 
greater force, perhaps from a cynical disposition, in 
comparing you with other men. I have long been 
acquainted with your private virtues, and my opinion of your political virtues is now confirmed. 
I am only concerned at your having thoughts of 
quitting parliament. I know your reasons, but 
cannot approve of them. You think, that as you 
are not a speaker, as you have no turn for business, vour attendance will little avail ; that it cannot contribute to stem the torrent of corruption 
and villainy which at present bears down every 
thing before it. It is this indolent or despairing 
method of reasoning, of many honest men, for I 
cannot help being persuaded that there are still 
many honest men, that have reduced us to this 
terrible situation. You know that the God of the 
Jews who should have been a judge of Jewish affairs, as he interfered in them so much, was of 
opinion that five righteous men were sufficient to 
save the rotten state of Gomorrah ; and I do not 
find that he meant they should be all speakers. 
Besides, the mass of the people of Gomorrah was 
all polluted, but the mass of the English people certainly is not. I believe no people was ever 
possessed of more public virtue, which is manifest 
from all their proceedings. I beg, my dear friend, 
you will not in despair quit the deck and get under hatches*— work at the pump — hand a rope, 
doing any thing with good will and firmness — encourage others to do the same, and with so intrepid a pilot, as Sir George Saville, the vessel may 
perhaps work into harbour, notwithstanding 
the abominable treason of the major part of the crew. 

I am yours, &c. 

C. LEE. 

Sir C. Davers.

Philadelphia, October 2dth, 177 I . 

My Lord, 

THE noble part your Lordship has acted in opposing all the diabolical measures of our accursed 
misrulers has encouraged me to address these few 
lines to you. Men who are embarked in the glorious cause of liberty should wave all ceremony. 
I shall therefore neither trouble you, nor myself 
with making apologies. Inclosed I send your 
grace a copy of the different resolves of the Congress, (though it is probable you may have received them before,) their address to the people of 
England, to the people of English America, to the 
people of Canada, and to the King. They argue 
so irresistibly, and they breathe so noble an ardor, 
that if there is the least understanding remaining 
in your island, and the least virtue latent, the former must be convinced, and the latter roused to 
action. What could put it into our blockheads 
heads, that these people could be tricked out of 
their liberties by their cunning, or bullied by any 
force which they tan send over ? What devil of 
nonsense could instigate any man of General Gage's 
understanding to concur in bringing about this 
delusion ? 1 have lately, my lord, run through 
almost the whole colonies, from the South to the 
North. I have conversed with all orders of men 
from the first estated gentlemen to the poorest 
planters, and cannot express my astonishment at 
the good sense and general knowledge, which pervades the whole; hut their elevated principles, their 
enthusiasm in the cause of freedom and their 
country, is still more admirable. 

I think I should not be guilty of exaggeration 
in asserting, that there are two hundred thousand 
strong bodied active yeomanry, ready to encounter 
all hazards and dangers, ready to sacrifice all considerations rather than surrender a tittle of the rights 
which they have derived from God and their ancestors : But this is not all, they are not like the 
yeomanry of other countries, unarmed and unused 
to arms ; but they are all furnished and all expert 
in the use. They want nothing but somearrangement, and this they are now bent on establishing. 
Virginia, Rhode Island, and Carolina are forming corps : Massachusetts Bay has long had a sufficient number instructed to become instructive to 
the rest ; even this Quakering province is following the example. I waspresent at a review of some 
of their companies at Providence in Rhodj Island, 
and really never saw any thing more perfect ; in 
short, unless the banditti at Westminster speedily 
undo every thing they have done, their royal paymaster will hear of reviews and manoeuvres not 
quite so entertaining as those he is presented with 
in Hyde Park and Wimbledon Common. 

I must now, my dear Lord, hasten to the main 
purpose of this letter : As your Lordship is justly 
consideredas one of the most strenuous advocates 
and patrons of this country, and one of the most 
active assertors of the rights of mankind, I must 
beg leave to propose to you, what, had you adverted to, I am persuaded you would have already 
adopted ; it is to set on foot a subscription for a 
relief or an indemnification for the brave sufferers 
of Boston. These people's sufferings and merit 
are so transcendent, that men less animated with 
Sentiment and public spirit than your Lordship, 
would exert themselves in their cause. A town 
consisting of thirty thousand people, perhaps of 
more ease and affluent circumstances than any 
other town of the world, reduced at one stroke to 
beggary and wretchedness ; every individual of 
them deprived of the means of supplying themselves with a morsel of bread, but what is furnished to them by the precarious hand of charity ; to 
see a whole people struggling with the extreme of 
distress, not only magnanimously, but cheerfully, 
rather than comply with the wishes of brutal tyrants, and thereby admit precedents injurious to 
mankind and posterity, is, I say, a strain of virtue almost too bright for modern eyes to gaze at ; 
and must fill every breast, not totally dead to sentiment and feeling, with rage, indignation, horror, 
and compassion. But they went further ; they 
made a formal offer to the Congress, to abandon 
their tow T n, with their wives, children, aged, and 
infirm, throw themselves on the charity of the inhabitants of the countiy, or build huts in the 
woods and never revisit their native walls, until reestablished in the full possession of their rights 
and liberties. Your Lordship will see the Congress's resolve on this head : These instances, I am 
sure, render unnecessary any thing I could say to 
incite a man of your Grace's stamp to exertions in 
their favour, or, more properly, in favour and support of human virtue. I should be very happy in 
receiving a couple of lines in answer ; it must be 
directed for me, at Richard Penn, Esq. at Philadelphia. 

I am, my Lord, your Grace's 

true friend, admirer, and 

humble servant, 

C. LEE

Philadelphia, June 7, 1775. 

My dear Sir, 

▼ ▼ E have had twenty different accounts of your 
arrival ai Boston, which have been regularly contradicted the next morning ; but as I now find it 
certain that you are arrived, I shall not delay a single instant addressing myself to you. It is a duty 
I owe to the friendship I have long and sincerely 
professed for you ; a friendship to which you have 
the strongest claims from the first moment of our 
acquaintance. There is no man from whom I 
have received so many testimonies of esteem and 
affection ; there is no man whose esteem and affection could, in my opinion, have done me greater honour. I intreat and conjure you, therefore, 
my dear sir, to impute these lines, not to a petulent 
itch of scribbling, but to the most unfeigned solicitude for the future tranquillity of your mind, and 
for your reputation. I sincerely lament the infatuation of the times, when men of such a stamp 
as Mr. Burgoyne and Mr. Howe can be seduced 
into so impious and nefarious a service by the artifice of a wicked and insidious court and cabinet. 
You cannot but recollect their manoeuvres in your 
own select committee, and the treatment yourself 
as president received from these abandoned men. 
You cannot but recollect the black business of St. 
Vincents, by an opposition to which you acquired 
the highest and most deserved honour. I shall not 
trouble you with my opinion of the righc of taxing America without her own consent, as I am 
afraid from what I have seen of your speeches, 
that vou have already formed your creed on this 
article; but I will boldly affirm, had this right been 
established by a thousand statutes, had America 
admitted it from time immemorial, it would be the 
duty of every good Englishman to exert his utmost 
to divest parliament of this right, as it must inevitably work the subversion of the whole empire. 
The malady under which the state labours, is indisputably derived from the inadequate representation of the subject, and the vast pecuniary influence of the Crown. 

To add to this pecuniary influence and incompetency of representation, is to insure and precipitate our destruction. To wish any addition, can 
scarcely enter the heart of a citizen who has the 
least spark of public virtue, and who is at the 
same time capable of seeing consequences the 
most immediate. I appeal, sir, to your own conscience, to your experience and knowledge of our 
court and parliament, and I request you to lay 
your hand upon your heart, and then answer with 
your usual integrity and frankness, whether, on the 
supposition America should be abject enough to 
submit to the terms imposed, you think a single 
guinea raised upon her would be applied to the 
purpose, (as it is ostentaciously held out to deceive 
the people at home,) of easing the mother country ? Or whether you are not convinced that the 
whole they could extract, would be applied solely 
to keep up still further the enormous fund for corruption which the Crown already possesses, and of 
which a most diabolical use is made. On these 
principles, I say, sir, every good Englishman, abstracted of all regard for America, must oppose 
her being taxed by the British parliament ; for my 
own part, I am convinced that no argument, (not 
totally abhorrent from the spirit of liberty, and the 
British constitution,) can be produced in support 
of this right. But it would be impertinent to trouble you upon a subject which has been so amply, 
and, in my opinion, so fully discussed. I find by 
a speech: given as yours in the public papers, that 
it was by the King's positive command you embarked in this service. I am somewhat pleased 
that it is not an office of your own seeking, though, 
at the same time, I must confess that it is very 
alarming to every virtuous citizen, when he sees 
men of sense and integrity, (because of a certain 
profession,) lay it down as a rule implicitly to obey 
the mandates of a court, be they everso flagitious. 
It furnishes, in my opinion, the best argument for 
the total reduction of the army. But I am running into a tedious essay, whereas I ought to confine myself to the main design and purpose of this 
letter, which is to guard you and your colleagues 
from those prejudices which the same miscreants, 
who have infatuated General Gage and still surround him, will labour to instil into you against a 
brave, loyal, and most deserving people. The 
avenues of truth will be shut up to you. I assert, 
sir, that even General Gage will deceive you, as 
he has deceived himself; I do not say he will do 
it designedly ; I do not think him capable : But 
his mind is so totally poisoned, and his understanding so totally blinded by the society of fools and 
knaves, that he no longer is capable of discerning 
facts as manifest as noon day sun. I assert, sir, 
that his letters to the ministry, (at least, such as the 
public have seen,) are one continued tissue of misrepresentation, injustice, and tortured inferences from mistated facts. I affirm, sir, that he has taken no pains to inform himself of the truth ; that 
he has never conversed with a man who has had 
the courage or honesty to tell him the truth. I 
am apprehensive that you and your colleagues 
may fall into the same trap, and it is the apprehension that you may be inconsiderately hurried by 
the vigour and activity you possess into measures 
which may be fatal to many innocent individuals, 
may hereafter wound your own feelings, and 
which cannot possibly serve the cause of those 
who sent you, that has prompted me to address 
these lines to you. I most devoutly wish, that 
your industry, valour and military talents, may be 
reserved for a more honourable and virtuous service, against the natural enemies of your country, 
(to whom our Court are so basely complacent,) 
and not be wasted in ineffectual attempts to redjuce 
to the wretchedest state of servitude, the most meritorious part of your fellow subjects. I say, sir, 
that any attempts to accomplish this purpose must 
be ineffectual. You cannot possibly succeed. No 
man is better acquainted with the state of this continent than myself. I have ran through almost 
the whole colonies from the north to the south, 
and from the south to the north. I have conversed with all orders of men, from the first estated 
gentlemen, to the lowest planters and farmers, and 
can assure you that the same spirit animates the 
whole. Not less than one hundred and fifty thousand gentlemen, yeomen, and farmers, are now in 
arms, determined to preserve their liberties or perish. As to the idea that the Americans are deficient in courage, it is too ridiculous and glaringly 
false to deserve a serious refutation. I never 
could conceive upon what this notion was founded. I served several campaigns in America the 
last war, and cannot recollect a single instanced 
ill behaviour in the provincials, where the regulars acquitted themselves well. Indeed we well 
remember some instances of the reverse, particularly where the late Colonel Grant, (he who lately 
pledged himself for the general cowardice of 
America,) ran away with a large body of his own 
regiment, and was saved frem destruction, by the 
valour of a few Virginians. Such preposterous 
arguments are only proper for the Rigbys and 
Sandwichs, from whose mouths never issued, and 
to whose breast, truth and decency are utter strangers. You will much oblige me in communicating this letter to General Hewe, to whom I could 
wish it should be considered in some measure addressed ; as well as to yourself. Mr. Howe is a 
man for whom I have ever had the highest love 
and reverence. I have honoured him for his own 
connections, but above all, for his admirable talents 
and good qualities. I have courted his acquaintance and friendship, not only as a pleasure, but as 
an ornament ; I flattered myself that I had obtained 
it. Gracious God! is it possible that Mr. Howe 
should be prevailed upon to accept such an office ! 
That the brother of him, to whose memory the 
much injured people of Boston erected a monument, should be employed as one of the instruments of their destruction ! But the fashion of the 
times it seems is such, as renders it impossible that 
he should avoid it. The commands of our most 
gracious sovereign, are to cancel all moral obligations, to sanctify every action, even those that the 
satrap of an Eastern despot would start at. I shall 
now beg leave to say a few words with respect to 
myself and the part I act. I was bred up from my 
infancy in the highest veneration for the liberties of 
mankind in general. What I have seen of Courts 
and princes, convinces me that power cannot be 
lodged in worse hands than in theirs ; and of all 
courts I am persuaded that ours is the most corrupt, 
and hostile to the rights of humanity. I am convinced, that a regular plan has been laid, indeed 
every act since the present accession evinces it, to 
abolish even the shadow of liberty from amongst 
us. It was not the demolition of the tea, it was 
not any other particular act of the Bostonians, or 
of the other provinces, which constituted their 
crimes ; but it is the noble spirit of liberty manifestly pervading the whole continent, which has 
rendered them the objects of ministerial and royal 
vengeance. Had they been notoriously of another 
disposition, had they been homines ad servitad? nem 
paratos, they might have made as free witn the 
property of the East India Company as the felonious North himself with impunity. But the lords 
of St. James's and their mercenaries of St. Stephens will know, that as long as the free spirit of 
this great continent remains unsubdued, the progress they can make in their scheme of universal 
despotism, will be but trifling. Hence it is, that 
they wage inexpiable war against America. In 
short, this is the last assylum of persecuted liberty. 
Here should the machinations and fury of her enemies prevail, that bright Goddess must fly oft* from 
the face of the earth, and leave not a trace behind. 
These, sir, are ray principles ; this is my persuasion, and consequently I am determined to act. 
I have now, sir, only to entreat, that whatever 
measures you pursue, whether those which your 
real friends (myself amongst them) would wish, or 
unfortunately those which our accursed misrulers 
shall dictate, you will still believe me to be personally, with the greatest sincerity and affection, 

Yours, &c. C. LEE. 

Gen. Burgoyne. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

Dear Sir, 

WHEN we were last together in service I should 
not have thought it within the vicissitude of human 
affairs that we should meet at any time, or in any 
sense as foes : the letter you have honoured me 
with, and my own feelings combine to prove we 
are far from being personally such. 

I claim no merit from the attentions you so kindly remember, but as they manifest how much it 
was my pride to be known for your friend ; Nor 
have I departed from the duties of that character, 
when I will not scruple to say, it has been almost 
a general offence to maintain it : I mean since the 
violent part you have taken in the commotions of 
the colonies. It would exceed the limits and propriety of our present correspondence to argue at 
full, the great cause in which we are engaged. 
But, anxious to preserve acoiibistentandingenuous 
character, and jealous, I confess, of having the 
parti sustain imputed to such motives as you intimate, I will state to you as concisely as I can, the 
principles upon which, not voluntarily, but most 
conscientiously, I undertook it. 

I have, like you, entertained from my infancy, a 
veneration for public liberty. I have likewise regarded the British constitution, as the best safeguard of that blessing to be found in the history of 
mankind. The vital principle of the constitution, 
in which it moves and has its being, is the supremacy of the King in parliament, a compound, indefinite indefensible power, co-eval with the origin 
of the empire, and co-extensive over all its parts : 
I am no stranger to the doctrines of Mr. Locke 
and other of the best advocates for the rights of 
mankind, upon the con) pact always implied between the governing and governed, and the right of resistance in the latter, when the compact shall 
be so violated as to leave no other means of redress. 
I look with reverence almost amounting to idolatry, upon those immortal men who adopted and 
applied such doctrine, during part of the reign of 
Charles the First, and in that of James the Second, 
should corruption pervade the three estates of the 
realm, so as to pervert the great ends of their institution, and make the power vested in them for 
the good of the whole people operate like an abuse 
upon the prerogative of the Crown to general 
oppression, I am ready to acknowledge, that the 
same doctrine of resistance applies as forcibly 
against the abuses of the collective body of power, 
as against those of the Crown, or either of the 
component branches separately : still always understood that no other means of redress can be obtained. A case, I contend, much more difficult to 
suppose when it relates to the whole, than when it 
relates to parts. But in all cases that have existed, 
or can be conceived, I hold, that resistance, to be 
justifiable, must be directed against the usurpation 
or undue exercise of power, and that it is most 
criminal when directed against any power itself inherent in the constitution. 

And here you will discern immediately why I 
drew a line in the allusion I made above to the 
reisrn of Charles the First. Towards the close of 
it the true principle of resistance was changed, and 
anew system of governmentprojected accordingly. 
The paci 'iots, previous to the long parliament, and 
during great part of it, as well as the glorious Revolutionists of 1681, resisted to vindicate and restore the constitution ; the republicans resisted, to 
subvert it. 

Now, sir, lay your hand upon your heart, as 
you have enjoined me to do on mine, and tell me, 
to which of these purposes do the proceedings of 
America tend? Is it the weight of taxes imposed, 
and the possibility of relief after due representation 
of her burthens, that has induced her to take up 
arms? Or is it a denial of the legislative right of 
Great Britain, to impose them, and consequently 
a struggle for total independency ? For this idea of 
a power that can tax externally and not internally, 
and all the sophistry that attends it, though it may 
catch the weakness and prejudices of the multitude in a speech or a pamphlet, is too preposterous 
to weigh seriously with a man of your understanding, and I am persuaded you will admit the question fairly put. 

Is it then for a relief from taxes? or from the 
controul of parliament " in all cases whatsoever," 
that we are in war? If, for the former, the quarrel 
is at an end. There is not a man of sense and information in America, who does not see it is in the 
power of the colonies to obtain a relinquishment 
of the exercise of taxation immediately and for 
ever. I boldly assert it, because sense and information must also suggest to every man, that it 
can never be the interest of Britain to make a second trial. 

But if the other ground is tnken, and it is intended to wrest from Great Britain a link of that 
substantial, and I hope, perpetual chain, by which 
the empire holds, think it not a ministerial mandate ; think it not a mere professional ardour ; 
think it not prejudice against any part of our fellow subjects, that induces men of integrity, and 
among such you have done me the honour to class 
me, to act with vigour. But be assured it is conviction, that the whole of our political system depends upon preserving entire its great and essential 
parts ; and none is so great and essential as the supremacy of legislation. It is conviction, that as 
the king of England never appears in so glorious a 
capacity as when he employs the executive power 
of the state to maintain the laws, so in the present 
exertions of that power, his Majesty is particularly 
entitled to our zeal and grateful obedience, not only as soldiers, but as citizens. 

These principles, depend upon it, actuate the 
army and fleet throughout : and let me at the 
same time add, there are few, if any, gentlemen 
among us who would have drawn his sword in the 
cause of slavery. But why do I confine myself 
to the fleet and army? I aflirm the sentiments I 
here touch, to be those of the great bulk of the 
nation. I appeal even to those trading towns 
which are sufferers by the dispute, and the city of 
London at the head of them, notwithstanding the 
petitions and remonstrances that the arts of parties and factions have extorted from some individuals ; and last, because least in your favour, I 
appeal to the majorities of the last year upon 
American questions in parliament. The most 
licentious news- writer wants assurance to call these 
majorities ministerial ; much less will you, when 
you impartially examine the characters of which 
they were in a great degree composed ; men of 
the most independent principles and fortunes, and 
many of them professedly in opposition in their 
general line of conduct. 

Among other supporters of British rights against 
American claims, I will not speak positively, but 
I firmly believe, I may name the men of whose 
integrity and judgment you have the highest opinion, and whose friendship is nearest your heart ; I 
mean Lord Thanet, from whom my aid de camp 
has a letter for you, with another from Sir C. Davers. I do not inclose them because the writer* 
(little imagining how difficult your conduct would 
render our intercourse) desired they might be delivered into your hands. 

For this purpose, as well as to renew " the rights 
of our fellowship," I wish to see you; and, above 
all, I should think an interview happy if it induced 
such explanations as might tend, in their consequences, to peace. I feel, in common with all 
around me, for the unhappy deluded bulk of this 
country : they foresee not the distress that is impending. I know Great Britain is ready to open 
her arms upon the first reasonable overtures of accommodation : I know she is equally resolute to 
maintain her original right ; and I also know, that 
if the war proceeds, your hundred and fifty thousand men will be no match for her power. I put 
my honour to these assertions as you have done 
to others ; and I claim the credit I am willing to 
give. 

The place I would propose for our meeting, is 
the house on Boston Neck, just within our advanced sentries, called Brown's House : I will 
obtain authority to give you my parole of honour 
for your secure return. I shall expect the same 
on your part, that no insult be offered me. If the 
proposal is agreeable to you, name your day and 

hour : and at all events, accept a sincere 

return of the assurances you honour me with, and 
believe me, Affectionatelv yours, 

J. BURGOYNE. 

P. S. I have been prevented, by business, answering your letter sooner. I obeyed your commands in regard to General Howe and Clinton ; 
and I likewise communicated to Lord Percv the 
contents of your letter and my answer. They all 
join with me in compliments, and authorise me 
to assure you they do the same in principles. 

Cambridge, Head Quarters, JulyMlh, iTTJ. 

General Lee's compliments to General Burgoyne : would be extremely happy in the interview he so kindly proposed ; but as he perceives, 
that General Burgoyne has already made up his 
mind on this great subject, and that it is impossible that he (General Lee) should ever alter his 
opinion, he is apprehensive that the interview 
might create those jealousies and suspicions so 
natural to a people struggling in the dearest of all 
causes, that of their liberty, property, wives, children, and their future generations. He must, 
therefore, defer the happiness of embracing a man 
whom he most sincerely loves, until the subversion of the present tyrannical ministry and system, 
which he is persuaded must be in a few months, 
as he knows Great Britain cannot stand the contest. He begs General Burgoyne will send the 
letters which his aid de camp has for him. If 
Gardiner is his aid de camp, he desires his love to him.

Camp on Prospcel Hill, Dec. lsl, illj. 

Dear Sir, 

AS lam just informed you are ready to embark 
for England, I cannot refrain from once more 
trespassing on your patience. An opportunity is 
now presented of immortalizing yourself as the 
saviour of your country. The whole British empire stands tottering on the brink of ruin, and you 
have it in your power to prevent the fatal catastrophe; but it will admit of no delay. For heaven's sake avail yourself of the precious moment: 
put an end to the delusion: exert the voice of a 
braye, virtuous citizen ; and tell the people at 
home, that they must immediately rescind all 
their impolitic, iniquitous, tyrannical, murderous 
acts; that they must overturn the whole frantic 
system, or that they are undone. You ask me, 
in your letter, if it is independence at which the 
Americans aim? I answer, No; the idea never 
entered a single American's head, until the most 
intolerable oppression forced it upon them. All 
they required was, to remain masters of their own 
property, and be governed by the same equitable 
laws which they had enjoyed from the first formation of the Colonies. The ties of connection 
which bound them to their parent country, were 
so dear to them, that he who would have ventured to touch them, would have been considered as 
the most impious of mortals ; but these sacred 
ties, the same men, who have violated or baffled 
the most precious laws and rights of the people at 
home, dissipated, or refused to account for their 
treasures, tarnished the glory, and annihilated the 
importance of the nation : these sacred ties, I say, 
so dear to every American, Bute and his tory administration are now rencling asunder. 

You ask, whether it is the weight of taxes of 
which they complain ? I answer, No : It is the 
principal they combat, and they would be guilty 
in the eyes of God and men, of the present world, 
and all posterity, did they not reject it ; for if it 
were admitted, they would have nothing that they 
could call their own ; they would be in a worse 
condition than the wretched slaves in the West 
India islands, whose little peculium has ever been 
esteemed inviolate. But, wherefore should I 
dwell on this ? Is not the case with Ireland the 
same with theirs ? They are subordinate to the 
British empire ; they are subordinate to the Parliament of Great Britain, but thev tax themselves, 
Why? as the case is similar, do you begin with 
them ? But you know, Mr, Burgoyne, audacious 
as the ministry are, they dare not attempt it. 
There is one part of your letter which, I confess I 
do not understand. If I recollect right, (for I unfortunately, have not the letter by me.) you say 
that if the privilege of taxing themselves is what 
the American's claim, the contest is at an end. 
You surely cannot allude to the propositions of 
North. It is impossible that you should not think, 
with me and all mankind, that these propositions 
are no more or less than adding to a most abominable oppression, a more abominable insult. But, 
to recur to the question of Americans aiming at 
independence : Do any instructions of any one of 
the provinces to their representatives, or delegates, 
furnish the least ground for this suspicion ? On 
the contrary, do they not all breathe the strongest 
attachment and filial piety to their parent country ? 
But if she discards all the natural tenderness of 
a mother, and acts the part of a cruel step-dame, 
it must naturally be expected that their affections 
will cease ; the ministry leave them no alternative, 
aut serviri, aut alienari jubent ; it is in human 
nature ; it is a moral obligation to adopt the latter. 
But the fatal separation has not yet taken place, 
and yourself, your single self, my friend, may 
perhaps, prevent it. Upon the ministry, I am 
afraid, you can make no impression ; for, to repeat a hackneyed quotation, 

They are in blood SteppM in so far, (hat, should they wade no more, 
To return would be as tedious as go o'er. 

But, if you will at once break off all connections with these pernicious men ; if you will wave 
all consideration, but the salvation of your country, Great Britain may stand as much indebted to 
General Burgoyne, as Rome was to her Camillus. 
Do not, I entreat you, my dear sir, think 
this the mad rhapsody of an enthusiast, nor the * 
cant of a factious designing man ; for, in these 
colours, I am told, I am frequently painted. I 
swear by all that's sacred, as I hope for comfort 
and honour in this world, and to avoid misery in 
the next, that I most earne stly and devoutly love 
my native country ; that I wish the same happy 
relation to subsist for ages betwixt her and her 
children, which has raised the wide arch of her 
empire to so stupendous and enviable a height; but c .£_ 
at the same time I avow, that if the parliament 
and people should be depraved enough to support 
any longer the present ministry in their infernal 
scheme, my zeal and reverence for the rights of 
humanity are so much greater than my fondness 
for any particular spot, even the place of my nativity, that, had I any influence in the councils of 
America, I would advise not to hesitate a single 
instant, but decisively to cut the Gordian knot, 
now besmeared with civil blood. 

This, I know, is strong emphatic language, and 
might pass, with men who are strangers to the 
flame which the love of liberty is capable of lighting up in the human breast, for a proof of my insanity ; but you, sir, unless I have mistaken you 
from the beginning, will conceive, that a man, in 
his sober senses, may possess such feelings. In 
my sober senses, therefore, .permit me once more 
most earnestly to entreat and conjure you to exert 
your whole force, energy, and talents to stop the 
ministry in this their headlong career. If you 
labour in vain, (as, I must repeat, I think will be 
the case,) address yourself to the people at large. 
By adopting this method, I am so sanguine, as to 
assure myself of your success ; and your public character will be as illustrious as your personal 
qualities are amiable to all who intimately know 
you. By your means the Colonists will long continue the farmers, planters, and shipwrights of 
Great Britain ; but if the present course is persisted in, an internal divorce must inevitably take 
place. As to the idea of subduing them into servitude, and indemnifying yourselves for the ex[•tnce, you must be convinced long before this 
of its absurdity. 

I should not, perhaps, be extravagant, if I advanced, that all the ships of the world would be 
too few to transport force sufficient to conquer 
three millions of people, unanimously determined 
to sacrifice every thing to liberty ; but if it were 
possible, the victory would not be less ruinous 
than the defeat. You would only destroy your 
own strength. No revenue can possibly be exacted 
out of this country. The army of place-men might 
be encrcased, but her circuitous commerce, founded on perfect freedom, which alone can furnish 
riches to the metropolis, would fall to the ground. 
But the dignity of Great Britain, it seems, is at 
stake. Would you, sir, if in the heat of passion 
you had struck a single drummer of your regiment, and afterwards discovered that you had 
done it unjustly, think it any forfeiture of your 
dignity to acknowledge the wrong ? No : I am 
well acquainted with your disposition, you would 
ask him pardon at the head of your regiment. 

I shall now conclude (if you will excuse the 
pedantry) with a sentence of Latin ; Justum est 
helium quibus fiecessarium, etpia arma quibus nulla, nisi in annis, relinquitur spes. I most sincerely 
wish you a quick and prosperous voyage, and 
that your happiness and glory may be equal to the 
idea I have of your merits, as, 

I am, with the greatest truth and affection, 

Yours, 

CHARLES LEE, 

Major Gen. Burgoyne.

Cambridge, ITTf S 

Sir, 

XN my letter, lately sent into Boston, all political disquisition was designedly avoided. I did 
not avail myself of the advantages which the sacred cause of my country, of liberty, and of human nature, manifestly gave me over Mr. Gage. 
I remonstrated with vou in decent terms, with 
respect to the hard and unworthy treatment shewn, 
as I have been informed, to the soldiers and citizens of America, whom the fortune of war, 
chance, or an erroneous opinion of your honour, 
had thrown into your hands. In answer to this 
remonstrance, we are insulted with the most outrageous language, and abusive epithets. Were 
we, Sir, the worst of traitors ; had we conspired 
to subvert the liberties of our fellow subjects ; 
had we conspired to re-establish on the throne the 
expelled tyrants of the Stuart house ; or, could 
we be charged with any notorious breach of faith ; 
had we, for instance, seduced some part of the 
troops under your command, upon certain conditions, into a surrender of their arms, and afterwards violated our engagement, the style which 
you assume would scarcely be justifiable. 

You affect, Sir, to despise all rank not derived 
from the same source with your own : to speak, 
as I think, with becoming pride, it is impossible 
to conceive a more honourable source than that to 
which I owe my present station. I was called to 
it by the voice of the freely chosen delegates of a 
virtuous and uncorrupt people. Yours, for ought 
I know, and, as I am told, is frequently the case, 
might have been obtained by connections with 
some prostitute part of a prostitute House of 
Commons 

You threaten us, Sir, with a cord : Begin, Sir ; 

- ; ^I dare you to it. Although my nature shudders 

K 7^ at the thought, necessity will force us to retaliate ; 

and we have it in our power, Mr. Gage, to make a ten-fold retaliation. 

You have the confidence to appeal to that 
Almighty God whose every law you have violated. 
Let that Almighty God, to whom the rights and 
happiness of his creatures cannot be indifferent, 
j ucige then between us. When the great and tremendous day shall arrive ; when all mortals are to 
render a strict account, which, do you apprehend, 
Sir will have the greatest reason to tremble ? 
The virtuous citizens, now forced to arms by the 
hands of tyranny ; in arms not to rob, spoil, and 
invade ; not as mercenary instruments to gratify 
the lust, ambition, avarice, or revenge of sceptered robbers or wicked ministers, but to defend 
their wives, children, and household goods, and 
to deliver down to their posterity the bright inheritance of freedom they received from their forefathers : which, I once more demand, shall, on that 
dreadful day, have the greatest reason to tremble ? 
The citizens engaged in this righteous cause, or 
those men, who by artifice, misrepresentation, and 
falsehood, have not only stained this fair continent 
with the blood of her children, but shaken the 
mighty empire of Britain to her foundation. 

1 shall now, Sir, close my correspondence with 
you, perhaps for ever, assuring you, that the intelligence you have received, with respect to the 
harsh treatment of the prisoners in our possession, 
is as remote from fact, as that which you have constantly transmitted to the ministry, when speaking of the principles and designs of America. 
Not only the officers and soldiers have been treated 
with the tenderness due to fellow-citizens and 
brethren, but even those execrable parricides 
born amongst us, who have aimed their daggers at 
the vitals of their parent, have been protected 
from the fury of a most justly enraged people. 

I shall now Sir, only add, that for the future, 
whatever mode of conduct you shall think proper 
to observe towards those of our people who are 
in your custody, such exactly are the ministerialists to expect in return. 
I am, Sir, 

Your most obedient,
 
Humble servant,
 
Gen. Gage. C. LEE.

Cambridge, 177 j. 

Dear Sir, 

JL LITTLE thought the time could ever arrive 
when I should not run with eagerness to embrace 
Mr. Gage. Whether it is from a cynical disposition, or a laudable misanthropy, whether it is to my 
credit or discredit, I know not ; but it is most 
certain, that I have had a real affection for very 
few men ; but that these few I have loved with 
warmth, zeal, and ardour. You, Sir, amongst 
these few, I swear by all that is sacred, have ever 
held one of the foremost places. I respected your 
understanding, liked your manners, and perfectly 
adored the qualities of your heart. These, Sir, 
are my reasons, paradoxical as they may appear to many, that I now avoid what I heretofore should 
have thought an happiness. Were you personally indifferent to me, I should, perhaps, from curiosity, appear in the circle of your levee ; but I 
hold in such abhorrence the conduct, temper, and 
spirit of our present court ; more particularly 
their present diabolical measures with respect to 
this country fills me with so much horror and indignation, that I cannot bear to see a man, from 
whom my affections can never be weaned, in the 
capacity of one of their instruments ; as I am convinced that the court of Tiberius, or Philip the 
Second, were not more treacherous and hostile to 
the rights of mankind than the present court of 
Great Britain. I cannot help thinking it one of 
the greatest curses fallen on mankind, that they 
should be endued with sufficient art to seduce or 
delude men of the best hearts and heads. My 
Lord Chatham himself was for a time their dupe ; 
and poor York was entrapped for his destruction. 
I believe, Sir, I know the tricks and insidiousness 
of the Cabinet better than vou do. I have no 
doubt, but they were hard set to work upon you. 
May God Almighty extricate you, with honour 
and safety, from their clutches ! I know not whether the people of America will be successful in 
their struggles for liberty ; I think it most probable 
they will from what I have seen in my progress 
through the colonies. So noble a spirit pervades 
all orders of men, from the first estated gentlemen 
to the lowest planters, that I think they must be 
victorious. I most devoutly wish they may ; for 
if die machinations of their enemies prevail, the 
bright goddess, Liberty, must, like her sister Astraea, utterly abandon the earth, and leave not a 
wreck behind. She has, by a damned conspiracy 
of kings and ministers, been totally driven from 
the other hemisphere. Here is her last asylum ; 
here I hope she may fix her abode. 

I have now, sir, only to entreat, that as knaves 
and fools will probably, from design and misunderstanding, exaggerate, disfigure, and distort 
what I do, and what I say, you will be upon your 
guard, particularly when it relates to yourself. 
Though it is difficult to separate the man from the 
office, should it be reported that I ever speak of 
you in terms of disrespect, I entreat, that you will 
slight the report. I am not capable of it. A 
personal friendship for Mr. Gage has taken too 
deep root in my breast; though, were you my 
brother, twinned at a birth, I must wish to defeat 
the purposes of those by whose instructions Govenor Gage must act. 

As to North, my opinion of him is this, (and I 
have known him a longtime,) that did he hear of a 
single freeman in the remotest part of the world, 
he would willingly put his country to the expence 
of furnishing forth an army and fleet for the sole 
pleasure of destroy ing that single freeman . I know, 
Sir, you will do me the justice to believe that I am 
not acting a part ; that no affectation has place in 
my conduct. You have known me long enough, 
I flatter myself, to be persuaded, that zeal for the 
liberties of my country and the rights of mankind, 
has been my predominant passion. May God 
Almighty bless you, Sir, and, with honour to you, 
dissolve the spell which has charmed you into a 
situation so incompatible with the excellence of 
your natural disposition. Excuse the length, and, 
if it appears to you, the impertinence, of this epistle, and believe me, 

With great esteem, 

Yours, 

CHARLES LEE, 

Gen, Gage.

Mr dear Fhipps, 

A HAVE not for a long time read any performance with so much pleasure, as the paragraph in the public papers announcing your safe 
return. I congratulate your country, your friends, 
and particularly myself, on this happy event. As 
I most sincerely love and honour you, I should 
have been pleased, in common with all mankind, 
had your hopes and expectations been answered 
in their full extent ; but, as your individual friend, 
I am completely satisfied ; for the attempt is sufficient to immortalize you. A young man of 
your rank and affluent circumstances, giving up 
his ease, pleasure, and connections, to encounter 
mountains, and even to risk the taking up his 
residence in the thrilling regions of thick Ribbedia, for the public benefit, would have appeared 
heroic in any age or nation ; but the inglorious 
insipid character of the present age heightens the 
lustre of the enterprize. 

Once more, my dear Phipps, I congratulate you 
and all your friends on your safe return ; and the 
honour which is your due, and which is not paid 
you at home, come to this country, where your 
praises are sung daily ; but your political parliamentary conduct has the largest share of their 
panegyrick. Their opinion of your integrity, talents, and consistency, is very high ; and I hope 
you will believe that I do not labour to weaken 
it. By all that is sacred, these are a fine people, 
liberal, enlightened, sensible and firm. Your 
Mansfields and Norths may play over their wretched tricks, have recourse to their paltry finesses, 
mav bluster and bellow, but thev will never be 
able to trick or frighten these men out of their 
liberties. They are too acute and vigilant for the 
former to avail, and much too strong for the latter. Twelve thousand fresh colonists, half Germans, half Irish, were imported this year into 
Philadelphia alone, and not a much less number 
into the colonies of Virginia and New- York. The 
banks of Hudson's River, of the Mohawk, Susquehannah, Juniatta, and the Ohio, from the Monongahela downwards thirty miles, which at the 
peace were totally a desert, are become one continued chain of villages. Four large military 
townships are immediately to be established on the 
Missisippi. I leave }'Ou to judge, whether it will 
be easy to dragoon so numerous a people for any 
length of time. Ships of war, it is true, may insult, and put to inconvenience some of their capital ports ; but these teasings and insults will only 
serve to shew the absurdity of your minister's policy in a more striking light, by giving a unanimity 
to these people equal to their effectual strength, 
when they may set at defiance the machinations, 
not only of an earthly, but of the infernal potentate 
himself and his ministry. Egregious blockheads ! their folly increases every day ; no sooner are they out of one bad scrape, but they get into a worse. 

This blessed tea project meets with a resistance 
full as vigorous, though more regular and temperate than the stamp act. The colonists, one 
and all, have entered into the most solemn obligations to send it back to its exporters, and continue furnishing themselves from the Dutch ; so 
that by the ingenuity of our ministry, smuggling 
is rendered an ~ *- - - - - - -. —

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

Slamford, Jan. 22rf, 1T76. 

SIR, 

S General Washington has informed the Congress of his motives for detaching me, it is needless 
to trouble you upon the subject ; I am, therefore, 
only to inform you, that I have collected a body 
of about twelve hundred men from the colony of 
Connecticut, whose zeal and ardour, demonstrated 
on this occasion, cannot be sufficiently praised. 
With this body I am marching directly to NewYork, to execute the different purposes for which 
I am detached. I am sensible, Sir, that nothing 
can carry the air of greater presumption, than a 
servant's intruding his opinion, unasked, upon 
his master ; but, at the same time, there are certain seasons when the real danger of the master 
may not only excuse but render laudable, the servant's officiousness. I therefore flatter myself that 
the Congress will receive, with indulgence and lenity, the opinion I shall offer. The scheme of disarming simply the tories, seems to me totally ineffectual ; it will only embitter their minds and add 
virus to their venom. They can, and will, always 
be supplied with fresh arms by the enemy. That 
of seizing the most dangerous will, I apprehend, 
from the vagueness of the instruction, be attended 
with some bad consequences, and can answer no 
good one. It opens so wide a door for partiality 
and prejudice, to the different congresses and committees on the continent, that much discord and 
animosity will probably ensue, it being next to impossible to distinguish who are, and who are not, 
the most dangerous. The plan of explaining to 
these deluded people the justice and merits of the 
American cause : - -. certainly generous and humane ; 
but, I am afraid, will be fruitless. They are so ri> 
vetted in their opinions, that, I am persuaded, 
should an angel descend from heaven with his golden trumpet, and ring in their ears, that their conduct was criminal, he would be disregarded. I had 
lately myself an instance of their infatuation, which, 
if it is not impertinent, I will relate. I took the liberty, without any authority but the conviction of 
the necessity, to administer a very strong oath to 
those of Rhode Island, that they would take arms 
in defence of their country, if called upon by the 
voice of the Congress. To this Colonel Wanton, 
and others flatly refused their assent ; to take arms 
against their sovereign they said was too monstrous. 
This is not a crisis, when every thing is at stake, to 
be over compliant to the timidity of the inhabitants of any particular spot. I have now under 
my command a very respectable force adequate to 
the purpose of securing the place, and purging all 
its environs of traitors, on which subject I shall expect, with impatience, the determination of the 
Congress ; their orders I hope to receive before 
or immediately on my arrival. 

This instant the inclosed express from the provincial Congress of New- York, was delivered into 
my hands ; but as these gentlemen probably are 
not fully apprized of the danger hanging over their 
heads, as I have received intelligence from camp, 
that the fleet is sailed, and that it is necessary to 
urge my march, I shall proceed with one division 
of the forces under my command to that city. A 
moment's delay may be fatal. The force I shall 
carry with me is not strong enough to act offensively ; but just sufficient to secure the city against 
any designs of the enemy. If this is to give umbrage, if the governor and captain of the man of 
war are pleased to construe this step as an act of 
positive hostility, if they are to prescribe what 
number of your troops, and what number not, 
are to enter the city, all I can say is, that NewYork must be considered as the minister's place, 
and not the continent's. 

I must now, Sir, beg pardon for the length of 
this letter, and more so, for the presumption in offering so freely my thoughts to the Congress, from 
whom it is my duty simply to receive my orders, 
and as a servant and soldier strictly to obey, which 
none can do with greater ardor and affection than, 
Sir, 

Your most obedient humble servant, 

CHARLES LEE. 
The Hon. John Hancock, Esq. 
Pres. of the 
Continental Congress. 



New-York^ March 5lfe, lTTo. 
Sin, 

JL RECEIVED your commands on Sunday 
evening, and should have answered it immediatelv, 
but waited for the result of an application I had 
made to Waterbury's and Ward's regiment, requesting them to remain here until they can be replaced by a certain number of troops from Philadelphia, and the Jerseys. They have ananimously 
consented to stay till the twenty-fifth of this month, 
which is a fortnight longer than the term they 
were enlisted for. Before the expiration of this 
time, I am in hopes that some measures will be taken by the Congress for throwing into the city, its 
environs, and Long Island, a force sufficient to dispute the ground with any number of troops w T e 
have reason to expect ; not that I would imply 
that these two Connecticut regiments remaining 
here would be able to prevent the landing and lodging themselves in the island, even five battalions of the enemy, should they chuse to attempt 
it ; but those two regiments will enable us at least 
to lay the foundation of the necessary works. I 
have ordered a regiment from the Jerseys, who 
will be here I hope in a few days. I shall not, Sir, 
trouble you with a detail of our intended works, 
as I shall have the power of paying my respects 
in person to the Congress in a very few days, for 
on Thursday it is my intention to set out. I am in 
very little pain about the execution of what we 
have concerted, as it is committed to the hands of 
Lord Stirling, who shews much intelligence and 
activity. As this place will probably be the scene 
of a good deal of action, it would be prudent to 
add something to their present stock of ammunition. I find by their returns, that there is in the 
whole colony, that sent up to Fort Constitution 
included, five tons and an half. 

The numerous body of professed tories in Long 
and Staten Islands, with not a few within the walls 
of the city, is a most alarming consideration ; the 
measures adopted by the Provincial Congress, of 
obliging them to give bonds as a security for their 
good behaviour, can answer no purpose, but that 
of rendering them more bitter and violent. The 
first regiment of our gracious sovereign's cutthroats which arrive here will indubitably cancel 
these bonds. I am well assured, indeed, that these 
bonds are made a public joke of already, by the 
worthy gentlemen who gave them. In short, the 
friends to liberty are to a man convinced, that the 
tories will take up arms, when encouraged by the 
appearance of any royal troops. The delicacy 
of our situation, the dangerous crisis of affkirs, 
have therefore determined me to take a decisive 
step, which alone, according to my judgment, can becure us : 1 have proposed to ofter to these people a test, drawn up in such terms, that refusal or 
consent to take it, must be a criterion by which 
we may be able to distinguish those, whose swords 
are whetted to plunge into the vitals of their country, and whose, if not drawn in defence of the 
common rights, may be expected to remain quietly in their scabbards. The first I have directed 
to be seized without further ceremonv, and I 
should think myself highly criminal, in omitting 
so salutary a step before it is too late ; perhaps I 
judge wrong; if I do, I must myself take the 
shame of being reputed weak, rash, and precipitate. The intelligence I have received irom General Washington will, at all events, justify, in 
some measure, my dispensing with forms. 
I am Sir, with the greatest respect, 
Your most obedient humble servant, 

CHARLES LEE.

Williamsburg, April 3d, 1T'<6. 

My dear sir, 

1 HAVE nothing of sufficient importance to 
trouble the Congress with; but shall teaze you with 
a few words ; I am exactly in the same situation I 
expected, puzzled where to go, or fix myself, 
from an uncertainty of the enemy's design : I can 
therefore only act by surmise ; the general opinion 
is, that they will aim at this part of Virginia, viz. 
York and Williamsburg, or that they will fix their 
head quarters in North Carolina : it has been already asserted, that Mr. Clinton was landed with 
one thousand five hundred men at Wilmington ; a 
letter from Brigadier Howe, dated from Edenton, 
says, that it is believed, but not ascertained. I 
wait for further intelligence ; in the mean time, I 
shall employ myself in rendering this place, and 
York, as inaccessible as possible ; for it is my own 
persuasion, that they wilt" endeavour to possess 
themselves of the capitol, not only as it is really a 
most tempting and advantageous post, from commanding two rivers, and a most abundant country ; 
but it would give an air of superiority and dignity 
to their arms which in this slave-country might 
be attended with important consequences, by the 
impressions it would make in the minds of the negroes. I wish we had a couple of good regiments 
more in South Carolina, it would then be perhaps 
hors insult. The apathy of this province seems to 
go passibus cequis, with that of some other provinces notwithstanding the pursuasion and assurances 
of all the officers, that the tories about Norfolk 
will most certainly repair to the King's standard, 
and have proposed means of securing them ; they 
say, such means would be violent and cruel. In 
short as your affairs prosper, the timidity of the 
senatorial part of the continent, great and small, 
grows and extends itself. By the eternal God, 
unless you declare yourselves independent, establish a more certain and fixed legislature than that 
of a temporary courtesy of the people, you richly 
deserve to be enslaved, and I think it far from impossible that it should be your lot ; as without a 
more systematical intercourse with France and 
Holland, we cannot, we have not the means of 
carrying on the war. 

Adieu, 

Yours, &c.

WilUamtburg, Jprii :>//«, 1776. 

Sir, 

Jl HE subject of this letter appearing to me of 
exceeding* importance, I have resolved to dispatch 
an express to inform you that the Roebuck, a 
King's ship of forty-four guns, has for some time 
left the Capes of Virginia, and, as we hear, is now 
lying off the Bay of Delaware, with a design to 
intercept the continental fleet. At Norfolk remain 
the Liverpool, a thirty gun frigate ; the Otter 
sloop of fourteen guns, and some tenders, together 
with a ship, Lord Dunmore on board, of little or 
no force ; and a number of vessels belonging to 
the tories, with valuable cargoes and prizes, 
amounting, by a reasonable estimate, to an hundred and forty thousand pounds sterling : If Mr. 
Hopkins is at Cape Fear, would it not be a good 
measure to inform him, how sure a prey these ships 
at Norfolk, with their immense treasure of goods, 
arms, ammunition, and other military stores would 
be to him, were he to come into the Capes of Virginia ? It is not probable our fleet can keep the 
sea much longer, a number of British ships of war 
being expected soon on the American coast ; this 
last mentioned stroke would then be a glorious 
conclusion ; and if it should be necessary afterwards to keep in a safe harbour, by erecting a battery at the mouth of the river leading to Norfolk, 
the navy of Great Britain might be, from the nature of the navigation, prevented from getting up. 
I am extremely anxious to know the state of your 
province, and of the state, number, and quality, of 
your troops ; any assistance which can be afforded you by this province, as far as depends on me, 
you may command. I should have set out before 
this, for your province, but the confusion, disorder, 
and deficiences of Virginia, oblige me to pass a 
few more days in my present quarters. 
I am, Sir, with the greatest respect.

Sir, 

J3I OT only propriety and decency, but an earnest desire to act in concert with so respectable a 
body, as the Committee of Safety, enjoin me to lay before them my thoughts, on some measures necessary for the defence and very being of the colony. 

After having considered the number and quality of your troops, the state and condition of your 
arms, artillery, and ordnance apparatus, the weakness and disadvantages you labour under from the 
nume'rous intersecting rivers, themultitudeof your 
slaves, &c. I suppose to myself, that the enemy 
will make this province their immediate object ; 
and since the defeat of their schemes in North 
Carolina, by Colonel Caswell, it is the most natural 
supposition. I say, Sir, after having considered 
your strength and weakness, no circumstance appears tome so seriously alarming as the disposition and situation of the inhabitants of the lower 
counties, Norfolk, and Princess Ann ; but that I 
might not rest entirely on my own opinion, I have 
t v idled together some of the field officers who are 
best acquainted with that district, and they unanimously agree, that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to secure and preserve the province, unless 
these inhabitants, thus dangerously disposed, are 
removed from the very spot where they can do 
such infinite mischief. I am sensible, Sir, that 
their removal must be attended with very considerable difficulties, and perhaps much distress to 
individuals ; but when the preservation and being 
of the province, if not of the whole continent are 
at stake, were these difficulties and distresses a 
thousand times greater, they must be submitted toI am in hopes, therefore, that the gentlemen of 
the committee will immediately devise some 
means for removing these people ; as well as their 
stock : at least their wives and children should be 
carried to a place of security, as hostages for the 
good behaviour of the husbands and fathers. I 
should be extremely sorry to find myself under the 
necessity of destroying all their cattle, store, and 
granaries ; and forcing the inhabitants, at the point 
of the bayonet, from their homes : but unless their 
removal can be accomplished by some other 
means, I shall be constrained to these harsh methods ; as otherwise, I cannot be answerable for the 
execution of the important trust committed to my 
hands.

Williamsburg, April 19Z/j, 1T76. 

Sir, 

A HE disagreeable uncertainty I have been in, of 
the enemies' designs, from the circumstance of 
their being able to fly in thejr ships from one spot 
to another, hath kept me at Williamsburg. It is 
evident that their original intention was against 
North Carolina, but the apparently total overthrow 
of their whole scheme by Colonel Caswell's victory, makes it more probable that they will bend 
their course to some other quarter ; whether to 
this province, or South Carolina, it is impossible 
to divine. I am myself jnore inclined to think 
that this will be their object, as the numerous intersecting navigable waters present them such superior advantages ; though, at the same time, I 
confess myself in great pain for South Carolina ; 
the force in that province seems alarmingly small. 
I wish I could afford to detach from hence at least 
three battalions; but neither our numbers of men, 
the state and condition of our arms, nor the vast 
extent of this province open to attack, will admit 
of the thought. If Pennsylvania could spare 
three or four battalions for the defence of Virginia, Virginia or North Carolina might detach the 
same number to South Carolina ; and as the army 
which was employed in the blockade of Boston is 
now set at liberty, I should imagine this force 
might be afforded us. 

We are so extremely deficient in arms, that I 
have been under the necessity of sending an officer into the back parts of the country to purchase 
all the rifles he can procure for the continental service. The arrangement I have made of arming 
two companies of each battalion with spears, will 
render musquets and bayonets less necessary ; and 
the ease I find in reconciling the men to these kind 
of arms, is a flattering symptom of their spirit. 
The price of these rifles, I am told, will be five 
pounds each ; but as the article of cartouches and 
bayonets will be saved, upon the whole, they will 
not be more, if so expensive. 

The defence and security of the capital rivers, 
with their creeks, is an object of so great importance, that I have thought it necessary to direct as 
great a number of half gallies as possible, to be 
constructed with the utmost expedition ; but as 
the carpenters and other artificers in this country 
are so lazv a race of mortals, that it is in vain to 
expect any fruits from their labours, unless there 
is a coersive power over them, I thought it the 
surest and safest method to establish two companies of carpenters on the same terms with those in 
the Jerseys ; the measure is absolutely necessary, 
and I flatter myself it will prove economy. 

The nature of the service here is such, the 
force not being collected into one point, but scattered in fragments, that a greater number of subordinate staff' officers are requisite than hi the 
Northern and Eastern armies. I have therefore 
taken the liberty, till the pleasure of the Congress 
is further known, to appoint a few who could not 
be dispensed with : inclosed is a list of them. 

The Committee of Safety, I find, Sir, had not 
apprized you of their having already raised a 
company of artillery, and appointed officers. Captain Innes who was placed at the head of it, though 
lie professes himself utterly ignorant of this particular branch, is a man of great zeal, capacity 
and merit ; and as there is a vacant majority in 
the ninth, or Captain Flemming's regiment, I have 
ventured to appoint him to act in that station, in 
hopes that Congress will confirm his commission. 
A body of horse is a sine qua non in a country circumstanced like this ; I take the liberty of enclosing you an address I published to the young gentlemen of this colony on the subject, and wish it 
may meet with your approbation. 

I shall make Monsieur Arundel accountable 
for the sixty dollars, but at the same time beg leave 
to submit to the consideration of the Congress, 
whether the expences of his journey should not 
be allowed; they amount to thirty dollars : indeed 
the pay of the artillery officers and engineers is so 
wretched, that I do not see any chance of procuring men fit for the service on the terms ; and if 
they are procured, they cannot possibly subsist, 
unless the expences of their frequent journeys are 
paid; for they are obliged, from the nature ot their 
business, to make more journeys than other officers, and not in corps, but singly ; I have been 
obliged to subsist Baron Massenburg, as likewise 
to furnish Captain Smith, who is now at York, 
with money for his expences. 

I am, Sir, with the greatest respect, 

Your most obedient humble servant, 

CHARLES LEE.

Williamsburg, May Ith, 1776. 

1 HE committee will, I hope excuse my not having yesterday made a report to them fas I think 
it my duty,) of every transaction which is not 
merely military ; but they were so much employed 
In the business of the Princess Ann petition, that 
I thought it better not to enter on the subject. 
As I found that the inhabitants of Portsmouth 
had universally taken the oath to Lord Dunmore, 
and as that town was, I believe, justly censidered 
as the great channel through which his Lordship 
received the most exact and minute intelligence 
of all our motions and designs, I thought it incumbent on me, and agreeable to the spirit of 
your instructions, to remove the people without 
exception ; for even the women and children had 
learnt the art, and practised with address, the office 
of spies. A considerable quantity of very valuable articles were found in the houses of Mrs. 
Sprowle, Goodrich, and Nuil Jamieson, such as 
molasses, salt and other things much wanted for 
the public. A list of these articles will be made 
out by the officer commanding the party, and laid 
before your board. 

As the town of Portsmouth will afford so convenient shelter and quarters to refresh the enemy, 
on a supposition that they make this part of the 
world their object, it would perhaps be politic to 
destroy it totally ; but the houses of some of the 
most notorious traitors I thought absolutely necessary to demolish, in hopes of intimidating the 
neighbourhood from trifling any longer, and flying in the face of your ordinances ; for it is inconceivable, unless I have been grossly misinformed, into what barefaced open intercourse 
with the enemy they had been encouraged by no 
examples having been made. Sprowk's, Goodrich's, Jamiesoi.'s and Skeddan's houses were on 
this principle destroyed ; the last, Skeddan, now 
a prisoner at Suffolk, accused, and, I believe, convictcd, of having been on board Lord Dunmore's 
fleet, since his acquittal by the committee of Norfolk. As we had undoubted intelligence that the 
fleet and army of Lord Dunmore were amply and 
regularly supplied with provisions and refreshments of every kind, from that tract of Country 
lying between the southern and eastern branches, 
as well as from Tanner's Creek, notwithstanding 
the positive ordinances levelled against this species of treason ; and as from a habit of any sort of 
action, be it ever so heinous, he who commits it, 
infallibly, in the end, persuades himself there is 
no crime in at all: so these worthies not only every 
day openly and constantly carried on this dangerous commerce, but it is said justified it in their 
conversation ; it, therefore, Sir, in my opinion, as 
well as of the other officers, and the committee of 
gentlemen from Suffolk, became indispensably necessary to take some vigorous steps on the spot, 
which might intimidate* the whole knot of these 
miscreants from their pernicious traffic. 

A Mr. Hopkins, infamous for his principles and 
conduct, and who has a son now a soldier in Dunmore's army, was fortunately the first man detected j he was seized in his return from the fleet, 
He prevaricated and perjured himself very handsomely on the occasion ; but at length the fact was 
proved, and he confesssed. The sentiments of the 
committee and other officers concurring with my 
own, we determined, after having siezed his furniture, to set his house on fire in his presence : This 
step was not quite consistent with the regular mode 
of proceeding ; but there are occasions, when the 
necessity will excuse deviations, and this I hope 
will appear to the committee to be one of these occasions. I must here, gentlemen, beg leave to repeat my assurances, that if ever'in my military 
capacity, I should fall into any measure, which is 
more properly within the province of the civil, it 
will entirely proceed from mistake, or inadvertency, never from design ; and upon these occasions, 
so far from being offended by the admonition, or 
even reprimand, of your committees, I shall think 
myself obliged to them. 

I am, Sir, with the greatest respect, 

Your most obedient humble servant,

Sir, 

Willwmsburg, May 1th, 1'. ,i 

X FIND the part I have acted in the business of 
Mr. Eden, has given great umbrage to the council of Maryland ; I take the liberty of enclosing a 
copy of my letter to that board on the occasion; as 
I hope it will appear to the Congress, a full explanation and justification of my conduct, I shall not 
trouble them any more on the subject. 

Five transports with troops are arrived at Cape 
Fear; I shall therefore set out on Thursday for Wilmington, by the way of Halifax. When we consider, Sir, the vast extent of the vulnerable parts 
of this country ; the numerous navigable intersecting waters, the multitude of slaves ; that we 
have not more than five thousand regulars fit for 
duty in the province ; that of these five thousand 
not more than three are properly armed ; that to 
arm them, defective as they are, the province has 
been drove to the necessity of disarming the minute 
men; I say, Sir, that when these circumstances are 
considered, I shall appear, I hope, reasonable, in entreating the Congress to spare us, if possible, 
some battalions, and of those battalions which are 
best armed. If indeed our minute men were 
properly furnished with musquets and ammunition ; if our rivers were already secured in the 
manner I propose ; I should think myself capable 
of baffling all their attempts with our present 
force ; but situated as we are, mv anxietv for the 
common safety obliges me to solicit a reinforcement. A letter from one of vour members informs me, that five thousand blankets, and five 
thousand pair of shoes, are on the road for the use 
of this army ; they were much wanted ; the number is, I believe, sufficient. We are as I observed before, wretchedly in want of medicines, as 
well as of a director to our hospital. Doctor 
M'Clurg is a very able man, and universally esteemed, qualified for the office : the pay of the regimental surgeons established by Congress is so 
low, that it is in this part of the world, where the 
common country practice of surgery is singularly 
lucrative, impossible to find capable men, who will 
accept ; but I am in hopes that the convention will 
make such additions out of the provincial purse, 
as to enable us to fill the commissions with proper 
and competent persons : Now I am on the subject 
of pay, sir, I must beg leave to urge the necessity 
of considerably increasing that of the engineers. 
It is impossible that men, qualified for this important office, should be prevailed upon to serve on 
such miserable terms. You have no American 
engineers ; they must of course be foreigners ; 
and foreigners expect, in their language, de quoi 
manger, that is, something which will enable them 
to eat and drink. Twenty dollars per month will 
not enable them to eat and drink, and wear linen, 
or indeed any kind of clothes ; besides, it must be considered, that these gentlemen are obliged, 
by the nature of their duty, to make more journeys than any other officers ; that horses must be 
purchased and fed ; that the expenses of travelling in these Southern provinces are very high ; 
from these reasons and many others, the pay of 
engineers ought to be, as it is in all other services, 
greater than that of other officers. Upon the 
whole, sir, I really do not think that they ought or 
<\an do with less than forty dollars per month, and 
rations at least for their horses. On more modeate terms I am persuaded you cannot procure men 
equal to the task : as the corps is distinct, and 
not numerous, this necessary addition of pay will 
be an expence beneath the consideration of Congress. 

Colonel Richard Henry Lee informs me, that it 
was not the intention of the Congress, that Captain Innis's company should be reduced, to make 
way for Arundel's ; but they should both be established. I think, sir, it would be a useless expence. Captain Innis, who must, I am sure, be 
an excellent officer in any other department, professed himself ignorant of this branch ; his officers were equally ignorant : Arundel has got possession of the company, and by his activity and 
knowledge will, I am persuaded, make them fit 
for service. Indeed, to establish an artillery company, captain, subalterns, and non-commissioned 
officers, being entirely composed of novices, can 
answer no' end or purpose. It is my opinion, 
therefore, sir, that instead of these two companies proposed, that the addition of thirty or forty 
men to Captain Arundel's, and two subaltern officers, will not only be better, but that it promises 
more advantage to the service. 

As I am on the subject of Captain Arundel, I beg leave to remind the Congress of what I men 
tioned on the subject of his expences on the road : 
There is one circumstance of which, sir, I could 
wish to be ascertained ; it is the expence of the 
defence of these rivers, that is, the construction 
of row galties, floating batteries, &c. to be brought 
to the account of the continent or of the province ? I wish to be informed on this head : if it is 
at the expence of the latter, I shall regularly propose to the Convention, or committee of safety, 
every scheme which may be attended with expence 
before it is entered upon. If the quarter mastergeneral, or his deputies, when they dispatch any 
teams from Philadelphia with powder, or other necessaries, were to purchase the horses throughout, 
for the continental use, instead of hiring them, 
the saving would be considerable ; for in this country the hire is intolerably dear ; so great indeed, 
that I have ventured to order a number of teams 
to be purchased. 

I have just received a vague return of the forces of North Carolina, of their powder and cannon ; it does not appear that they have effective regulars, properly armed, more than two thousand ; 
of powder than two tun and an half; and as to 
cannon they are almost totally destitute. As the 
enemy's advanced guard, if I may so express myself, is actually arrived, I must, I cannot avoid detaching the strongest battalion we have to their assistance ; but, I own, I tremble at the same time 
at the thoughts of stripping this province of any 
part of its inadequate force. I am puzzled how 
to direct my motions from the uncertainty of the 
enemies' plan, but not dispirited, as I am confrdent that the Congress will afford me every relief 
in their power, and am not in the least diffident of 
the courage and zeal of the men and officers. I have, as yet, heard nothing of Mr. Stabler ihe engineer ; I ought, in fact, to have at least half adow?en ; for we have a variety of posts to throw up, 
and there is not a man or oflicer in the army thai 
knows the difference between a chevaux de frieze 
and a cabbage garden. I wish the Congress would 
indulge me with Mr. Smith, whom I know to be 
an able and active man. 

I am, sir, with the greatest respect, 
Your most obedient, 
Humble servant, 

CHARLES LEE.

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

Willia7)isburg!i, May 9//i, 1TTC 

Sir, 

VS I am obliged, by the arrival of the enemy, to 
repair to North Carolina, and am not less prompted 
by my zeal and affection for this province, than 

obliged by my duty, to take every precaution for 
its safety before my departure! on this principle, I beg leave to lay before the Convention the 
following measures, which I conceive to be necessary : 

1st. To devise some means for establishing a 
corps of cavalry ; without which, an army is so 
extremely defective in every part of the world, 
and in none more than in this, for reasons which it 
might be tedious to enumerate. 

2dly. Without delay to order some able pilots 

>[ every river, to examine accurately the narrowest 
part of the channel of each river ; what is the nature of the shoals which form these channels; 
v.V '.her they are solid, firm sand , gravel, or rock ; 
what is the distance of the nearest part of the channel from either shore ; what is the nature of the 
shore ; whether it is high or low ; for I am sanguine enough to hope, when these circumstances 
are ascertained, the navigation of most of the rivers may be shut up to the enemy, by means of 
batteries, either floating or fixed. 

3dly. As these purposes cannot be effected without a large body of carpenters, smiths, and artificers of every sort, to establish some companies of 
them, subject to the military laws ; for, without a 
coersive power, it is difficult in this part of the 
world to prevail on them to work. 

4thly. As I understand there are prodigious 
flocks of sheep and cattle on the islands near the 
eastern shore, and as my authority does not extend 
to whatever concerns property, that you will order 
immediately all this stock to be transported to the 
continent; and if this is impracticable, to kill them, 
as otherwise they may must indisputably fall into 
the hands of the enemy. 

5thly. As the eastern counties are from their 
great abundance of all the necessaries of life, so 
tempting objects to the incursions of the enemy, 
and as I understand there will be no difficulty in 
procuring good men, I would humbly propose to 
the Convention, to augment Colonel Flemming's 
regiment to the same strength of numbers with 
the other battalions. 

I must now, Sir, beg leave to mention to the 
gentlemen of the Convention, a very important 
matter of consideration ; no less than the preservation of the lives of your soldiers. The continental 
allowance to surgeons and surgeons' mates of the 
regiments is so miserably small, and at the same 
time, the common country practice of surgeons is 
so very lucrative in this province, that it is not 
possible to find men qualified for the station who 
will accept ; and as I cannot venture to propose, 
to the Continental Congress, the increase of the pa} 
of the surgeons of the whole army, merely because this encrease is necessary in my division, I 
must submit it to the judgment of the Convention, 
whether such an addition, as to bring up the pay 
of these gentlemen to the original provincial ordinance, will not be money well and necessarily expended. 

I am, Sir, with the greatest respect, 

Yours, 

CHARLES LEE, 

To Edmund Pondleton, Esq. President of the Convention.

Williamsburgk, March 2.5th, 1776. 

Dear Sir, 

X KNOW not whether, in the whole course of 
my life, I ever read any thing which so much moved my pity and indignation as the late declaration, profession of faith, or political creed, (for 
I confess I am at a loss what title to give it,) of the 
Convention of Marvland. The instruction of 
your assembly to their delegates (which, inter ?ios 
was a most wretched piece of business) was Roman magnanimity comparatively with this snivelling production from Annapolis. They declare, 
that they shall esteem separation from Great Britain as the last of misfortunes. 

There is a story of a Morocco slave, in the reign 
of Muley Ishmael, who pushed his loyalty so far, 
that when the monarch, in the gaite de cceur, had 
plunged his dagger into his breast he drew it out 
and most loyally presented it again to his sacred master, who as royally, by a second stroke dispatched him. This story is scarcely credible, but. the 
possibility of the fact is now verified by the conduct 
of the House of Convention of Maryland. What ! 
when an attempt has been made to rob you and 
your posterity of your birth-rights ; when your 
fields have been laid waste, your towns have been 
burnt, and your citizens butchered; when your 
property is seized and confiscated in all parts of the 
world; when an inexorable tyrant, an abandoned 
parliament, and a corrupt pusilanimous people, 
have formed an hellish league to rob you of every 
thing men hold most dear ; is it pc/ssible that there 
should be creatures who march on two legs, and 
call themselves human, who can be so destitute 
of sentiment, courage, and feeling, as sobbingly to 
protest, they shall consider separation from these 
butchers and robbers as the last of misfortunes ? 
Oh, I could brain you with your ladies fans !

ORDERS. 

A.S it now appears almost a certanty, (from the 
intelligence of some deserters,) that the enemy's 
intention is to make an attack on the city ; and as 
the General is confident, that the numbers and 
spirit of the garrison will prevent their landing, it 
only remains to guard against the injury which 
the city may receive from their cannon. 

The continental troops, provincials, and militia, 
are, therefore, most earnestly conjured to work 
with no less alacrity, than fight with courage. 
Courage alone will not suffice in war : true soldiers and magnanimous citizens must brandish the 
pick-axe and spade, as well as the sword, in defence of their country ; one or two days labour, 
* at this critical juncture, may not only save many 
worthy families from ruin, but many worthy individuals from loss of limbs and life. On this 
principle the General docs not, simply in his 
capacity of commanding officer, order, but entreat 
the whole garrison, (those on the necessary duties 
excepted,) to exert themselves in forwarding the 
requisite works of protection. 

The colonels or commanding officers of the 
corps are to review their men's arms this evening 
at roll calling; to take care they are in as good 
order as possible, and that they are furnished with 
good flints. The officers commanding the different guards are to do the same with their respective guards. 

For the future it must be observed, as an established rule, that no artillery officer fires a single 
cannon without previously acquainting the General.

Charles-town, June tint, 17TG. 

Sir, 

IT is a certain truth, that the enemy entertain a 
most fortunate apprehension of American riflemen. It is equally certain, that nothing can diminish this apprehension so infallibly as a frequent ineffectual fire. It is with some concern therefore, 
that I am informed, that your men have been suffered to fire at a most preposterous distance. Upon this principle I must entreat, and insist that you 
consider it as a standing order, that not a man under your command is to fire at a greater distance 
than one hundred and fifty yards, at the utmost ; 
in short, that they never fire without almost a moral 
certainty of hitting their object. Distant firing 
has a double bad effect ; it encourages the enemy, and adds to the pernicious persuasion of the 
American soldiers, viz. That they are no match 
for their antagonists at close fighting. To speak 
plainly, it is almost a sure method of making them 
cowards. Once more I must request, that a stop 
be put to this childish, vicious, and scandalous 
practice. I extend the rule to those who have the 
care of the field pieces ; four hundred yards is the 
greatest distance they should be allowed to fire at. 
A transgression of this rule will be considered as 
the effect of flurry and want of courage. 

Those who are accused of transgressing, will be 
proceeded against, as acting from these principles. 
I have, Sir, the greatest opinion of your good 
sense and spirit, and flatter myself, that you will 
not only issue orders of restriction on this head, 
but that you will be attentive that they are vigorously put in execution. 

I am, Sir, your most obedient humble servant. 

CHARLES LEE, 

To Col. Thompson. 

P. S. I am likewise informed, that your men 
pass without order, or orders, to Long Island.

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

t'hnrhs-toiiK, Ju-i; Id, 1776. 

Sir, 

A SHOULD have done myself the honor sooner 
of informing the Congress of the attack made by 
the enemy's squadron on Sullivan's Island, and 
their repulse ; but conjectured, that by waiting 
a day or two, I might probably be furnished with 
the means of sending a more minute, full, and 
satisfactory account. My conjecture was right ; 
for yesterday five seamen made their escape, one 
of whom is a more intelligent fellow than is commonly found amongst men of his level. Inclosed 
is a copy of their narrative ; some parts of it are, 
perhaps, too whimsical and trivial to merit the attention of Congress, but I think it my duty to 
present it as it is, without adding or curtailing a 
circumstance. I think, sir, I may venture to congratulate the Congress on the event : not only 
the advantages must be considerable, but the affair reflects no small credit on the American arms. 
On Friday about eleven o'clock, the Commodore, with his whole squadron, consisting of two 
line of battle-ships and six frigates, the rates of 
which are marked in the inclosed narrative, anchored at less than half musket shot from the fort, 
and commenced one of the most furious and incessant fires I ever saw or heard. It wns manifestly their plan to land at the same time their whole 
regulars at the east end of the island, and of course, 
invest the fort by land and sea. As the garrison 
was composed entirely of raw troops, both men 
and officers ; as I knew their ammunition was 
short ; and as the bridge by which we could reinforce, or call oft' the troops from the island, was 
unfinished, you may easily conceive my anxiety. 
It was so great, that I was in suspence whether I 
should evacuate it or no. Fortunately, while I 
was in this state of suspence, some ammunition 
arrived from the town, and my aid de camp, Mr. 
Byrd, returning from the island with a flattering 
report of the garrison's spirit, I determined to support it at all hazards. On this principle I thought it 
my duty to cross over to the island, to encourage 
the garrison by my presence ; but I might have 
saved myself that trouble ; for I found, on my arrival, they had no occasion for any sort of encouragement ; I found them determined and cool to 
the last degree : their behaviour would, in fact, 
have done honour to the oldest troops. I beg 
leave, sir, therefore, to recommend, in the strongest terms, to the Congress, the commanding officer, Colonel Moultrie, and his whole garrison, as 
brave soldiers and excellent citizens ; nor must I 
omit, at the same time, mentioning Colonel 
Thompson, who, with the South Carolina rangers 
and a detachment of the North Carolina regulars, 
repulsed the enemy in two several attempts to 
make a lodgment at the other extremity of the island. 

Our loss, considering the heat and duration of 
the lire, was inconsiderable : we had only ten men 
killed on the spot and twenty-two wounded ; seven of whom lost their limbs, but with their limbs 
they did not lose their spirits ; for they enthusiastically encouraged their comrades never to abandon the standard of liberty and their country. 
This, I do assure you, sir, is not in the style of 
gasconading romance, usual after every successful action, but literally fact; I, with pleasure, mention the circumstance, as it augurs well to the 
cause of freedom. At eleven the fire ceased, having continued just twelve hours without the least 
intermission. What the enemy's intentions are 
now, it is impossible to divine. I am inclined to 
think, they wili, if they can repass the bar, bend 
their course to Chcsapeak or Hampton Bay : perhaps shame and rage may prompt their land forces 
to some attempt before their departure : on my 
part, I shall spare no pains to discover their intentions, and baffle their schemes. 

As Georgia is a district of the command with 
which you have honoured me, I thought it prudent to request some of their members to a conference with the president of this province, and myself. They accepted the invitation, and gave us 
great satisfaction from their intelligence and good 
sense : inclosed is the substance of their deliberation. 

The province is certainly of the last importance 
to the common cause, and the mode of protecting 
it, pointed out by these gentlemen, is, in my opinion, in all its parts wise and necessary. They had 
conceived a notion that I had powers to augment 
their establishment ; I assured them I had no such 
powers ; but both Mr. Rutledge and myself gave 
it as our opinion, that any cxpences manifestly beyond their faculties which they might incur in the 
common cause, would be repaid by the Congress ; 
and in this persuasion we ventured to encourage 
them to augment their cavalry without loss of 
time, and make the proposed present of cattle to 
the Indians. Indeed, sir, without a strong corps 
of cavalry, I do not see how it is possible to protcct these Southern colonies, and with one thousand good cavalry, I think I could insure their protection. From the want of this species of troops, 
Charles-town and its dependencies had certainly 
been lost, if the enemy had acted with the vigor 
and expedition we had reason to expect ; but a 
most unaccountable languor and inertness on 
their parts have saved us. If the scheme I proposed in Virginia had been approved and adop • 
ted, it would have been not only a security 
but considerable economy. The forage was 
to have been the only expence. Now I am upon 
the subject, I cannot help mentioning, that I have 
been informed that the project has been considered by some gentlemen, as a sort of a presumption in me, in arrogating such a power ; 
but I fancy the affair was not properly understood : 
I saw the immediate necessity of such a corps. I 
knew they could be raised immediately by these 
means, and at the same time I was given to understand, by several gentlemen of the Virginia 
convention, that should the Continental Congress 
disapprove of the expence (trifling as it was) 
there was little doubt of their convention defraying it ; but, in fact, Sir, the measure seemed 
necessary for the salvation of the provinces, and 
not a day was to be lost ; which, I hope, will fully 
justify my conduct : and I must beg leave to repeat my assertion, that without cavalry these provinces cannot easily be defended. 

I wish some means could be devised c^ad 
cing East Florida to an American provincegms 
I force sufficient, I should, with your p- these 
certainly attempt it; the advantages hey not 
great and manifold. The augments escape, 
Georgian cavalry, I sincerely hope rr with us : 
ved of by the congress. Inclosed is Upon the 
merit and pay proposed for them ; I s which the 
not high. , the temper are improving 
I shall now, Sir, conclude with expressing the 
high satisfaction I have received from the zeal, activity, and public spirit of the gentlemen and inhabitants of this city and province, from the president and council, down to the lowest order of the 
people ; and with assuring you, that I have not, in 
my military capacity, met with the least obstruction or difficultv ; but that we have all worked in 
concert and harmony for the common good. I 
most earnestly request you will pay my respects 
to the congress, and be persuaded, Sir, that I am, 
most entirely and devotedly, 

Your most obedient servant, 

CHARLES LEE. 

To the Hon. John Hancock, Pres. of the Continental Congress. 

P. S. Lord Dunmore has, I believe, with him 
at present only one ship of war ; if any part of the 
continental fleet should happen to visit Hampton 
Bay at this juncture, it would defeat the whole 
scheme of the enemy's operations, at least for this 
campaign ; but it is impossible to say how long 
his Lordship may remain in this weak condition.

yon3 tRutledge will inform you by this express of 

commoi^ges committed by the Cherokees, which 
and in tlnonstrued as the commencement of a war.

time, and fcplan laid down by our enemies, is to lay 
the Indians, ovinces, burn the inhabitants, and 
of cavalry, I men, and children in one common 
tect these SouC hands of the Indians; and as this 
sand good cavai, though a piece of inhumanity, is 
certainly more big with mischievous consequences than the rest, it appears to me absolutely necessary to crush the evil oefbre it arises to any dangerous height. Indeed if we avail ourselves of the 
event, it may prove a fortunate one. Perhaps 
we ought, in policy, to have wished for it. We 
can now, with the greatest justice, strike a blow 
which is necessary to intimidate the numerous 
tribes of Indians from falling into the measures of 
our enemies ; and as these Cherokees are not esteemed the most formidable warriors, we can, probably, do it without much risque or loss. I think 
then, Sir, that without a moment's delay, a body 
of your frontier riflemen should be immediately 
furnished, and march into the country of the 
Overfull Cherokees, and make a severe, lasting, 
and salutary example of them. The Carolinians 
propose at the same time attacking their lower 
towns, and, with the co-operation of Virginia, entertain no doubt of success. 

Clinton's army and Parker's squadron are pretty much in the same situation as when I wrote last. 
They daily, indeed, make some alterations in the 
position of their land troops from one island to 
another; perhaps for new air or water, of which, 
the deserters say, they are in great want. They 
tell us likewise, that considerable sickness prevails 
in the army, and Greater discontents from hard 
duty and bad diet. The spirit of desertion begins 
to shew itself, five soldiers came over these 
two last nights, who assure us, that were they not 
on an island, from which it is difficult to escape, 
two-thirds of their army would soon be with us : 
I am myself inclined to believe them. Upon the 
whole, when I consider the difficulties which the 
enemy's Generals have to encounter, the temper 
and disposition of their troops, and the improving spirit of ours, I assure myself, that the game is iu 
our hands. God give us more grace than to shuffle it away.

Ckarles'towi, July 10th, 171 o. 

My dear Friend, 

JL HAVE received yours, of the 28th of May, 
and did not think it possible that any thing could 
come from vour hand to p-ive me so disagreeable 
sensations. You tell me a dark, mysterious story 
of a certain great General of whon prince Ferdinand has declared, si Von veut un oj/lcier, &c. this 
great General in the clouds, will, it seems, graciously condescend to serve America, on condition that 
congress will give him assurances of stepping 
over the heads of every officer but one, and this 
he submits to, only on consideration of the confidence due to an American. You ask my opinion 
on this subject ; but the palpable meaning of your 
letter is, to prepare me for a cession of my rank 
in favour of some impudent adventurer. Buckwith is th : man, as you conjecture, from his 
known political principles and military abilities, 
which are so transcendent, that I ought for the public interest to make a second sacrifice. I am not, 
I believe, naturally proud ; I do not think myself 
conceited of my talents ; but to be put in competition, much more to be spurned aside, to make 
room for so despicable a character as Buckwith> a 
generally reputed coward, (and a b d sycophant,) I say, to be kicked out of my station for 
such a creature as this, would swell a man more 
humble than myself into a trumpeter of his own 
merits. Great God ! is it come to this ? I am 
not, it seems, an American ; but I am not, (if I 
may so express myself,) Americanior ipsis Americanis ? Have I not, such has been my zeal for 
your cause, once already waved my military claims 
in deference to the whim and partiality of some of 
your members ? Did I not consent to serve under 
an old church- warden, of whom you had conceived a most extravagant and ridiculous opinion ? 
Your eyes were at length opened, and deacon 
Ward returned to his proper occupation ; and 
would you now a second time, (do you think it 
consistent with decency, I may say, gratitude or 
common honesty) to load me a second time with 
a similar disgrace ? Have I betrayed any ignorance in my profession ? Have I shewn a deficiency in courage ? Am I slackened in my zeal or 
industry ? What have"! done to merit such an 
indignity ? What part of my conduct can justify 
your harbouring such an idea ? Have not I staked 
my fortune, life, and reputation in your cause ? Is 
there a service in Europe to speak proudly, (your 
injurious proposal forces me to it,) is there a service in Europe, where with some small reputation, 
and my powerful friends, I might not expect the 
same rank I now hold ? Have I not made myself 
a voluntary slave for the insurances of American 
freedom ? Have I, sleeping or waking, employed 
a single thought, but for her welfare, glory or 
advantage ? But enough of this — You ask my 
opinion, and I will freely, explicitly, and concisely give it to you. If the Congress supercede me, 
I will, I must obey ; but, I hope, in common justice, and for their own honour, that they will reestablish me, at least in part, in the easy fortune 
which I have forfeited, so as to enable me to retire 
from a service to which I am no longer thought 
adequate. Before 1 conclude, let me once more 
repeat confidentially to you, that if Buckwith is 
the man, in whose favour you meditate so gross a 
piece of injustice, you will make a very bad bargain, as he is certainly, unless fame belies him, 
neither possessed of courage, abilities, or integri
In God's name, if a real genius, or acknowledged hero, favoured by Heaven with a more than 
common portion of etherial spirit, should present 
himself, (a la Lippe, or Bragansa,) receive him 
■with open arms, as an immediate present from 
God ; invest him with the command of the whole. 
No man loves, respects, and reverences another 
more than I do General Washington. I esteem 
his virtues, private and public. I know him to 
be a man of sense, courage, and firmness, but if 
a hero should start up, endowed with the attributes, 
which, according to my persuasion reside in the 
two I have mentioned, and who would charge 
himself with the mighty task of your political 
salvation, General Washington ought, and, I am 
convinced, would resign the truncheon ; but that 
a little, paltry, impudent adventurer should sneakingly stipulate for the second rank, when, if his 
motives were pure, he could be equally serviceable 
in the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth ; it is rtot to be 
endured, it is a gross imposition on common understanding, and a grosser attempt to rob an individual. I must beg and conjure you. my dear 
friend, for such I am sure you are, to consider the 
delicate, perhaps, you will say, false notions in 
which soldiers are bred ; and that you will be 
careful of putting to so severe a trial the sensibility of one, who is most sincerely, devotedly, and 
affecionately, 

Yours,

Cliarks-ioim, July, 29//t, 1776. 

"Dear Sir, 

I USED to regret not being thrown into the 
world, in the glorious third or fourth century of 
the Romans, but I am now thoroughly reconciled 
to my lot. The reveries which have frequently 
for a while served to tickle my imagination, (but 
which when awakened from mv trance, as constantly I considered as mere golden castles built 
in the air,) at length bid fair for being realized. 
We shall now, most probably, see a mighty empire 
established of freemen, whose honour, property, 
and military glories are not to be at the disposal 
of a sceptered tyrant; nor their consciences to 
be fettered by a proud domineering hierarchy. 
Every faculty of the soul will be now put in motion, no merit can lie latent ; the highest offices 
of the state ? both civil and military, will now be obtained, without court favour, or the rascally 
talents of servility and observance, by which court 
favour could alone be acquired. Sense, valour, 
and industry will conduct us to the goal : every 
spark of ability which every individual possesses, 
will now be brought forth and form the common 
aggregate for the advantage andhonourof the community. The operations of war will be directed 
by men qualified for war, and carried on with that 
energy natural to a young people. True unartized 
knowledge, unsophisticated learning, simple, genuine eloquence and poetry wall be carried to the 
highest degree of perfection. This to many, I 
am sensible, would appear rant, but to you, who, 
I think, have congenial feelings with my own, 
it needs no apology. However, I shall now endeavour to deliver myself more like a man of this 
world. 

I most sincerely congratulate you on the nobk 
conduct of your countrymen ; and I congratulate 
your country on having citizens, deserving of the 
high honour to which you are exalted ; for the 
being elected to the first magistracy of a free people is certainly the pinnacle of human glory ; and 
am persuaded that they could not have made a 
happier choice. 

Will you excuse me ? but I am myself so extremelv democratical, that I think it a fault in your 
constitution that the governor should be eligible 
ior three years successively. It appears to me 
that a government of three years may furnish an 
opportunity of acquiring a very dangerous influence ; but this is not the worst ; Tacitus says, 
plura peccantur, dum demeremur, quam (him cjfendimus. A man who is fond of oflice, and has his 
eye upon re-election will be courting favour and 
popularity, at the expence of his duty. He will 
give way to the popular humours of the day, let 
them be ever so pernicious. In short, his administration will be relaxed in general, or partial 
to those whom he conceives to have the greatest interest : Whereas were all hopes of re-election precluded, till after the intervention of a certain number of years, he would endeavour to illustrate 
the year of his government by a strict, rigorous, 
and manly performance of his duty. These notions may perhaps be weak and foolish ; but such 
as they are, I am sure you will excuse my uttering them. 

There is a barbarism crept in among us that extremely shocks me, I m£an those tinsel epithets, 
with which (I come in for my share) we are so 
beplaistered : His Excellency, and His Honour ; 
The Honourable President of the Honourable Congress, or the Honourable Convention, This fulsome nauseating cant may be well enough adapted to barbarous monarchies; or to gratify the 
adulterated pride of the magnifici in pompous aristocracies ; but in a great, free, manly, equal commonwealth, it is quite abominable ; for my own 
part, I would as soon they would put rats-bane in 
my mouth, as the Excellency with which I am 
daily crammed. How much more true dignity was 
there in the simplicity of address amongst the Romans ! Marcus Tullius Cicero, Decimo Bruto 
Imperatori, or Caio Marcello Consuli, than to his 
Excellency Major General Noodle, or to the Hon. 
John Doodle. My objections are perhaps trivial 
and whimsical ; but, for my soul I cannot help 
starting them. If, therefore, I should sometimes 
address a letter to you without the Excellency 
tacked, you must not esteem it a mark of personal 
or official disrespect, but the reverse. 

The discontent of the troops which you mention us arising from the want of regular payment, 
might have been remedied by General Lewis ; 
his warrant is undoubtedly sufficient for the paymaster : howevc r, I have written to that gentleman on this subject, and am in hopes that affairs 
for the future will be more satisfactorily conducted. 

An old rice-boat which we converted the other 
day into a row-battery, has made a considerable 
prize ; no less than a brig with a whole company 
of the royal highland emigrants on board, consisting of two officers and fifty men: although they saw 
that they were inevitably our prize, had the impudence to throw their arms overboard, for which 
the)' ought to have their ears cut off, as it was contrary to all the rules of war. 

I send von inclosed the state of the enemv's 
navy ; I think there is no doubt of their army 
having steered their course Northward ; on this 
presumption I shall direct my course towards 
Virginia, but first must assist to regulate the military affairs of this province, in the best manner 
I can ; though, in fact, that will be doing little ; 
the inconveniences of this complex play we are 
acting, of Duke and no Duke, are numberless and 
great. The president is thought by some to be 
the real commander, I am thought so by others ; 
in short, there must be no troops but continental. 
The council is at present employed in settling a 
more regular post. We have received none these 
eighteen days ; for my own part, I conclude the 
mail has been intercepted and carried on board the 
man of war. Seven tons and a half of powder 
were safely landed four days ago, at Georgetown. 

Adieu, dear Sir, and believe me to be 

Most entirely and sincerely yours, 

CHARLES LEE.

Clutrhs-Town, Aug^d, 1TT6. 

Sib, 

WISH I had been informed how I am to address myself in writing to the Board of War ; 
whether to the board in general, to the first 
members on the list, or to the secretary. I have 
ventured on the last mode ; if it is wrong, I hope 
I shall be excused and corrected. The irregularity and tardiness of the post are now become a 
matter of my serious concern ; we never receive 
a letter from Philadelphia in less than six or seven 
weeks ; that from the members of the Board of 
War and Ordnance is only just now arrived, 
though dated the twelfth of June. I have been 
pressed, sir, by several members of the Convention of Virginia, to establish a post for this district ; but am apprehensive, that it might interfere 
with the continental post ; however the consequences arising from the irregularity of the post 
are so very serious, that all other considerations 
must be waved : In the mean time I am constrained to the necessity of putting the continent 
to the expence of an express almost on every occasion. 

I am extremely rejoiced at the establishment of 
a Board of War ; for the business of Congress 
was so complex and heterogeneous, that it was impossible they should give the necessary attention 
to the affairs of any one distinct department ; 
their regulations with respect to returns, &x. shall 
be punctually observed. I have ordered General 
Armstrong to collect the returns from the different 
corps, to digest them into one, and transmit them 
immediately to the Congress. 

I m myself busied in arranging matters for aii 
expedition into East Florida. It is much to be 
lamented, that these Southern colonies suffered the whole of last winter to pass over their heads without preparing the means either of offence or defence. Not a single row- galley or armed boat 
was furnished by Virginia, North, or South Carolina ; were we provided with a moderate fleet of 
these sort of vessels, I think I could ensure the 
reduction of East Florida, an object, though not 
equal with Canada, is certainly of very great importance. Here the measures of the Southern 
Indians are concerted and planned, their treaties 
negociated and concluded ; here they receive their 
bribes, for their murderous operations, and from 
hence they are supplied with all the means and instruments of war : from hence they have lately 
made some alarming incursions into Georgia, carried off a considerable number of negroes, and 
not less than two thousand head of cattle : they 
have likewise thrown up a post on the river St. 
Mary's, which, if suffered to remain, may prove 
extremely troublesome to Georgia, by affording a 
ready asylum to negro deserters. 

From these considerations, although I cannot 
think of laying siege to Augustine, having neither 
boats, horses, waggons, nor any other means of 
conveying cannon, ammunition, or provision for 
the purpose, I think it both a prudent and necessary measure to attempt breaking up the whole 
province of East Florida. It will be a security 
to Georgia, occasion infinite distress to the garrison of St. Augustine, but above all, make a salutary impression on the minds of the Creeks, who 
now are thought to stand wavering. They profess a good disposition towards the American 
cause ; but if, by a strong predatory expedition 
into the province of the enemy, we give an idea 
of our prowess and superior strength, they will be 
rivetted in our interest. If I was sure Mr. Clinton and his army had steered their course to NewYork, as the deserters all agree, and a letter which 
was left in Long Island confirms, (a copy of which 
is here enclosed,) I should, as I have nothing immediately else to do in my district, march in person with this party ; but the bare possibility of 
his being gone to Virginia will detain me. Every ship of the enemy has now repassed the bar. 
It appears by this same inclosed letter that they 
were more roughly handled than even the deserters represented. 

The Congress I make no doubt have been informed of the incursions made, and the ravages 
committed by the upper and lower Cherokees ; an 
expedition I understand is furnished forth by Virginia, against the upper nations ; another by this 
province against the lower ; the success or miscarriage is of the last consequence; I am therefore desirous of forming a second line, or corps de 
reserve, and detaching for this purpose, a regiment 
of regulars, but have not as yet been able to procure waggons sufficient for two companies. It 
will be necessary that Congress should make some 
regular establishment for waggons. I should 
think one waggon at least, if not two, should be 
purchased and appointed to each company of the 
whole army, and regiments made responsible for 
theirs respectively. We should then be able to 
march when occasion requires expedition ; at present it is sometimes as much impossible to march 
an hundred miles, although the fate of a province 
depended upon it, as if the soldiers wanted legs. 

I hope the Congress and Board of War will excuse my giving an opinion on a subject on which 
it has not been asked ; but I conceive it to be 
my duty not to remain silent on any affairs of 
such moment. I find, sir, that representations 
have been made, that many inconveniences 
would arise from putting the troops of this province on the continental establishment. I can 
aspire the Congress, that it is almost impossible to 
carry on the service, if they remain on the colonial establishment ; the difference of the laws, 
the distinction of rank, occasion so much confusion ; and the ridiculous farce of Duke and no 
Duke, we are playing, (the officers not always 
comprehending who is their proper commander, 
whether the president, or continental general,) 
occasions very dangerous distractions ; but there 
are other matters of more serious consideration, 
of which I shall not trouble you with a detail ; 
nor do I find that the officers of this province object to a continental establishment, on the contraiy, all those I have conversed with seem desirous 
of it. Upon the whole, I think it absolutely essential to the public service, that these regiments 
should immediately be put on the same footing, 
and be governed by the same laws, with the rest ; 
nor am I singular in opinion : the two brigadiers, 
all the officers of every rank, and the greater 
part of the gentlemen of the country concur with me. 

Colonel Muhlenburg of the eighth battalion of 
Virginians has been made very uneasy by some 
letters he has lately received with respect to the 
rank of his regiment. These letters intimate, 
that it was never the intention of the Congress to 
consider the seventh, eighth, and ninth, battalions 
of the Virginians on the continental establishment 
until they were entirely complete. That his regiment never was entirely complete; and that, consequently, after having so long thought himself 
on the continental establishment ; and on this presumption having marched five hundred miles from 
his own province, under the command of a continental general, he now, at least, finds himself only a provincial officer. 
I have ventured to assure him and his officers, 
who are equally uneasy, that there must be some 
mistake in this affair ; in fact, the hardship would 
be so great, that I cannot believe their apprehensions are well founded. It was, if I remember 
right, notified in April, by the Committee of 
Safety in Virginia, that they were then taken upon 
the continental establishment ; and though in this, 
I may be mistaken, without the proviso of their 
being complete. 

It happened at this time, though not complete to 
a man, (for no regiment ever is complete to a man,) 
that Muhlenburg's regiment was not only the most 
complete of the province, but, I believe of the whole 
continent ; it was not only the most complete in 
numbers, but the best armed, clothed and equipped in all respects for immediate service; I must 
repeat, that I cannot conceive that it was ever the 
intention of Congress that the establishment 
should be filled to a man ; but that they should 
be competent to service in or out of their province. In most services when new levies are 
raised, one half of the proposed complement entitles them to establishment. Muhlenburg's regiment wanted only forty at most. It was the 
strength and good condition of the regiment, that 
induced me to order it out of its own province, 
in preference to any other. I certainly considered them at that time as continental troops, otherwise I could have no authority to order them out 
of the province. 

I must now submit it to the consideration of 
the Congress, if it would not really be the greatest cruelty, that their strength and good condition should be turned against them. It was their 
strength and good condition which carried them 
out of their province, where, had they remained and known that it was a necessary condition of 
their establishment to be complete to a man, 
they certainly could have accomplished it in three 
days. I do, therefore, most sincerely hope, and 
confidently persuade myself, that Muhlenburg's 
regiment will at least date their rank from the 
day I ordered them to march out of their province ; not only justice, but policy requires it, 
for you will otherwise lose a most excellent regiment. 

I often represented to congress how difficult or 
impossible it would be to engage or retain, after 
they were engaged, any engineers of tolerable qualification on the wretched pay established. The 
two appointed to my district have (as I expected) 
quitted the service ; it was indeed impossible for 
them to exist. Stadler, I hear, has entered into 
the service of Virginia. Massenburg is retained 
by this province, at fifty-four dollars per month, a 
servant, rations, and his travelling expenses. He 
formerly begged his dimission from me, assuring 
me, (and, I believe, sincerely,) he was zealous in 
the cause of America ; that he would willingly, if 
I chose it, enlist as a common soldier ; but that to 
ride about the continent from north to south, find 
horses, and appear like a gentleman was impossible. I could not in conscience force him to starve, 
so consented to his engaging in this service. I 
am now without a single engineer, and really know 
not how to carry on the business. I hope the 
Board will consider the necessity of supplying me. 

I shall now, Sir, conclude, with assuring them, 
that I am, with the greatest respect, their most 
obedient humble servant, 

CHARLES LEE.

the extensive business of superintending the safety of so vast a territory, as that which the Congress 
have committed to my charge, renders it impossible for me to attend to the detail of the regiments, 
or, in any reasonable time, to collect and digest the 
various returns ; but I have given orders to the 
brigadiers to be as accurate as possible on this 
subject in their respective districts, and have no 
reason from my knowledge of the men, to think 
they will be deficient. As a thorough knowledge 
of the present condition of this colony, of its 
strength and weakness, is certainly a matter of 
very serious consideration, I shall lay before the 
Board the best and most accurate information I am 
able. 

Georgia is a state of much greater importance 
to the empire of America than generally supposed, 
at least, than what I myself imagined before I visited it. The variety of navigable rivers, commodious harbours, and fine inlets : the prodigious 
quantities of rice, and immense stocks of cattle, 
both on the islands, and on the main ; but, above 
all, the gentleness and salubrity of the winter seasons, with the conveniency of its situation for 
commerce with the West India Islands would render it a most valuable possession to the enemy ; 
the Altamaha, a very noble river, already furnishes a considerable quantity, and may, in time, furnish any quantity of lumber ; the garrison of St. 
Augustine, and, indeed, the whole province of 
East Florida, draw their subsistence from Georgia ; and, if all intercourse were with her cut off, 
that nest of robbers and pirates would probably 
fall to the ground, and, of course, the empire of 
the United States become more round and entire. 
These circumstances summed up together, must 
evince the importance of keeping Georgia or any 
part of it out of the hands of the enemy ; the 
means of doing it, demands the utmost attention. 
I have turned my thoughts to the subject, and 
shall beg leave to submit the result to the consideration of the Congress. The present state of the 
strength of this colony, consists of Colonel M'lntosh's battalion, a return of which, is here enclosed, a company of independent artillery, consisting of three officers and twenty- three privates, 
with about twenty-five hundred militia of all sorts; 
but in a very great part of these, (as I learn from 
the authority of their own captains,) very little 
confidence can be placed, their principles being 
extremely contaminated by a most pernicious 
banditti of enemies to the common liberty. M'lntosh's battalion is really a very fine one, (one of 
the best I think on the continent,) but as, perhaps, 
it might appear a harsh task, to insist on this battalion's acting with the necessary rigour against 
some of their nearest connections and relations, 
accused of being concerned in treasonable practices ; it is my intention to remove them either into 
South or North Carolina, where they can be more 
serviceable, and have an opportunity of completing themselves, which, in this state, from 
the dearth of men is impossible, and replace them 
with an equal or greater number from South Carolina. 

Such is the present condition^ of the strength 
of Georgia, very far from being adequate to its defence. My scheme for its security is, as row gillies, and armed boats are so well calculated for 
what is called the inland navigation, give them an 
infinite advantage over vessels merely sailing, 
which in these straight confined waters have no 
room for manoeuvring ; they will secure the rivers against the predatory incursions of the enemy, 
prevent the desertion of negroes, sweep the coasts 
clear of tenders : but, above all, facilitate f he 
means of the different states mutually assisting 
each other with troops, cannon, provision, and 
other requisites, which is now effected with difficulties, slowness, and monstrous expencc. Three 
gallics are already on the stocks in this port, and 
we have armed and equipped several boats with 
swivels, and one gun on the bow of each. The 
least of them capable of containing thirty men, 
and rowed with fourteen oars ; sailors, of whom 
we find so great a scarcity, are not necessary for 
this species of vessels, the soldiers arc competent 
to the business ; besides the equipment of these 
gallies and boats, I proposed establishing little 
forts or redoubts, in certain situations, on the 
river St. Mary's, Satilla, Sapello, and Altamaha, which may enable us to make incursions 
from time to time, when circumstances require it, 
into East Florida, and render it dangerous for 
them to make attempts of a similar nature into 
Georgia. These redoubts, or little forts, will likewise serve as places of rendezvous, refreshment, 
andretreat for bodies of horse rangers which ought 
continually to be patroling on the frontier. Such 
are the best methods, after having consulted the 
most intelligent people, which, in my opinion, can 
be devised for the defence and security of this 
State, unless, indeed, we could prevail on the province, to contract their frontier, by breaking up 
all their settlements on the other side of the Altamaha, which to me, I confess, appears a wiser and 
more economical measure ; but this I am afraid, 
is not to be accomplished. 

I must now beg leave to lay before the Board, 
a matter of the highest concern, and which certainlv demands the most serious attention of Congress, as, unless remedied, it may not only elistress 
the circumstances of the public, but bring a disgrace on the American character; I mean the unconscionable aelvantages which individuals, merchants, mechanics, farmers, and planters are suffered to take of the public necessities. If boats, 
waggons, horses, drugs, clothing, skins, necessaries, even little refreshments, such as fruit or garden stuff, are wanting for the soldiers, no price being regulated, the extortion is monstrous: the expences of the war must not only be prodigiously 
swelled by this want of regulation, but the officers and soldiers are disgusted to the service by 
the toleration of such impositions; for instance, 
the Virginians and North Carolinians are so much 
out of temper with Charles- town on this head, that 
should it be again attacked, and the assistance of 
these troops be again requisite, I am afraid we shall 
find a dangerous repugnance in them to march, 
when ordered. I most devoutly wish, therefore, 
that the congress will make it an object to remedy 
this evil. Might they not recommend or enjoin 
to the legislatures of the different states, to appoint 
a committee of assessors, from their respective 
bodies to fix the prices of the different articles in 
their provinces ? Whether this method is or is not 
proper, I cannot pretend to say ; but something, I 
must repeat should be done. 

The waste, difficulty, and expence arising from 
a want of method in provisioning the troops, 
when assembled in any particular spot, upon an 
emergency, are so great, that magazines ought to 
be established in every province, more particularly in those, which have the greatest probability of being attacked : by these means, the troops 
will not only be better fed, but be an immense 
saving to the continent ; for the contractors, not 
being pressed for time, can at their leisure, purchase every species of necessaries in these parts, 
where they are best and cheapest ; but, when a 
great and sudden demand is made, either for cattle, corn, spirits, Sec. they are under a necessity of 
taking that which is next at hand, and giving the 
sellers their own price. On this consideration, in 
concurrence with the president and council of 
Soini Carolina, I have thought it expedient to establish some magazines in South Carolina, of pork, 
beef, corn, &x. besides straw and whiskey, which, 
in these low damp countries, are absolutely necessary ; atall'events, this establishment can be no loss 
to the continent, as the beef and pork, at least, 
can always, with advantage, be exported to the 
West Indies. Were I at a less distance from the 
Congress, I should not take the liberty of laying 
out a single dollar without having obtained their 
approbation ; but, at this distance, I must assume 
such a power, or let the public affairs go to wreck, 
and of course, prove myself totally unworthy of 
the great trust the Congress have reposed in me. 
I am, Gentlemen, 

With the greatest respect, 

Your most obedient, and 

Very humble servant, 

CHARLES LEE.

Savannah, Ang. 30/ft, 1776. 

Sir, 

IT will be necessary in addressing a letter of 
this nature, so abruptly to your excellency, that 
I should inform you who the writer is. I have 
served as lieutenant-colonel in the English service, 
colonel in the Portuguese, afterwards as aid du 
camp to his Polish majesty, with the rank of major general. Having purchased a small estate in 
America, I had determined to retire, for the remainder of my days, to a peaceful asylum : when 
the tyranny of the ministry, and court of Great 
Britain, forced this . ontinent to arms, for the 
preservation of their liberties, I was called, by the 
voice of the people, to the rank of second in command. I make no doubt of this letter's being 
kindly received by your Excellency, both in the 
character of a good Frenchman, and friend to 
humanity. The present conjuncture of affairs 
renders the interest of France and of this continent one and the same thing ; every observation 
drawn from history must evince, that it was the 
exclusive commerce of these colonies, which enabled Great Britain to cope with France, gave to 
her a decided superiority in marine, and, of 
course, enabled her in the frequent wars betwixt 
the two nations to reduce her rival to the last 
extremity. This was the case, so peculiarly in the 
last war, that had the British ministry persevered, 
Heaven knows what would have been the fate of 
France. It follows, that if France can obtain the 
monopoly, or the greater part of this commerce, 
her opulence, strength, and prosperity, must grow 
to a prodigious height ; and nothing can be more 
certain, than that if America is enabled to preserve 
the independence she has now declared, the greater part of this commerce, if not the monopoly, 
must fall to the share of France. 

The imaginary plans of conquest of Lewis the 
Fourteenth, had they been realized, would not 
have established the power of that monarchy, on 
so solid and permanent a basis, as the simple assistance, or rather friendly intercourse with this 
continent, will inevitably give. Without injustice, 
or the colour of injustice, but, on the contrary, 
only assuming the patronage of the rights of mankind, France has, now in her power to become 
not only the greatest, but the most truly glorious 
monarchy which lias appeared on the stage of the 
world. In the first place, her possessions in the 
islands will be secured against all possibility of attack ; the royal revenues immensely increased, 
her people eased of their present burdens, an 
eternal incitement be presented to their industry, 
and the means of increase by the facility of providing sustenance for their families multiplied. In 
short, there is no saying what degree of eminence, 
happiness, and glory, she may derive from the independence of this continent. Some visionary 
writers have indeed asserted, that could this country once shake oft' her European trammels, it 
would soon become more formidable alone, from 
the virtue and energy, natural to a young people, 
than Great Britain with her colonies united in a 
state of dependency. But the men who have 
built such hypotheses must be utter strangers to 
the manners, genius, disposition, turn of mind, 
and circumstances of the continent. Their disposition is manifestly to agriculture, and the simple life of shepherds. As long as vast tracts of 
land remain unoccupied, to which they can send 
colonies (if I may so express it) of their offspring, 
they will never entertain a thought of marine or 
manufactures. Their ideas are solely confined 
to labour and to planting, for those nations, who 
can, on the cheapest terms, furnish them with the 
necessary utensils for labouring and planting, and 
clothes for their families ; and till the whole vast 
extent of continent is fully stocked with people, 
they will never entertain another idea. This cannot be effected for ages ; and what then may happen, it is out of the line of politicians to lay any 
stress upon : most probably, they will be employed in wars amongst themselves, before they aim 
at foreign conquests. In short, the apprehension 
is too remote to rouse the jealousy of any reasonable citizen of a foreign state. On the other hand, 
it is worthy your Excellency's attention, to consider what will be the consequences, should Great 
Britain succeed in the present contest. America. 
it is true, will be wretched and enslaved ; but a 
number of slaves may compose a formidable army 
and fleet. The proximity of situation, with so 
great a force, entirely at the disposal of Great Britain, will put it in her power to take possession of 
your islands on the first rupture. Without pretending to the spirit of prophesy; such, I can assert, will be the event of the next war ; upon the 
whole, I must repeat, that it is for the interest, as 
well as glory of France, to furnish us with every 
means of supporting our liberties, to effect which, 
we only demand a constant systematic supply of 
the necessaries of war. We do not require any aid 
of men, we have numbers, and, I believe, courage 
sufficient to carry us triumphantly through the 
struggle. We require small arms, powder, fieldpieces, woollen and linen to clothe our troops ; 
also drugs, particularly bark : in return for which, 
every necessary provision for your islands may be 
expected, as rice, corn, lumber, &c. If, indeed, 
you could spare us a few able engineers, and artillery officers, they may depend upon an honourable 
reception and comfortable establishment. The 
Sieur de la Plain, one of your countrymen, now 
engaged in the cause of the United States of America will have the honour of delivering this letter 
to your Excellency. I have no doubt of his being 
received with that politeness, and kindness, to be 
expected from a gentleman of your rank and character. 

I am, with the highest respect, your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

CHARLES LEE.

Camp at Vu lh y-Forgc, June ith, 1772. 

My dear Rish, 

HOUGH I hac no occasion for fresh assurances of your friendship, I cannot help being much 
pleased with the warmth which your letter, delivered to me by Mr. Hall, breathes ; and, I hope, it is 
unnecessary to assure you, that my sentiments, 
with respect to you, are correspondent. 

You will think it odd, that I should seem to be an 
apologist for General Howe : I know not how it happens, but when I have taken prejudices in favour, 
or against a mm, I find it a difficulty in shaking 
them off. From my first acquaintance with Mr. 
Howe, I liked him : I thought him friendly, candid, good natured, brave, and rather sensible than 
the reverse. I believe still, that he is naturally 
so ; but a corrupt, or, more properly, no education, the fashion of the times, and the reigning 
idolatry amongst the English, (particularly the 
soldiery ;) for every sceptered calf, wolj \ hog, or 
ass have so totally perverted his understanding 
and heart, that private friendship has not force sufficient to keep a door open for the admittance of 
mercy towards political heretics. He was, besides, 
persuaded that I was doubly criminal, both as a 
traitor and deserter. In short, so totally was he 
enebriated with this idea, that I am convinced he 
would have thought himselt both politically and 
morally damned had he acted any other part than 
what he did. He is, besides, the most indolent of 
mortals : never took farther pains to examine the 
merits or demerits of the cause in which he was 
engaged, than merely to recollect, that Great Britain was said to be the mother country, George 
the Third King of Great Britain, that the parliament was called the representatives of Great Bn 
tain, that the King and Parliament formed the supreme power, that a supreme power is absolute 
and uncontrollable, that all resistance must, consequently, be rebellion ; but, above all, that he was 
a soldier, and bound to obey in all cases whatever. 
These are his notions, and this his logic ; but 
through these absurdities I could distinguish, 
when he was left to himself, rays of friendship and 
good nature breaking out. It is true he was seldom left to himself; for never poor mortal, thrust 
into high station, was surrounded by such fools 
and scoundrels. M'Kensy, Balfour, Galloway, 
were his counsellors : they urged him to all his 
acts of harshness ; they were his scribes ; all the 
damned stuff which was issued to the astonished 
world was theirs. I believe he scarcely ever read 
the letters he signed. You will scarcely believe 
it, but I can assure you as a fact, that he never read 
the curious proclamation, issued at the head of 
Elk, till three days after it was published. You 
will say, that I am drawing my friend Howe in. 
more ridiculous colours than he has yet been represented in ; but this is his real character. He is 
naturally good humoured, complaisant, but illiterate and indolent to the last degree, unless as an 
executive soldier, in which capacity he is all fire 
and activity, brave and cool as Julius Caesar. His 
understanding is, as I observed before, rather good 
than otherwise ; but was totally confounded and 
stupified by the immensity of the task imposed 
upon him. He shut his eyes, fought his battles, 
drank his bottle, had his little whore, advised with 
his counsellors, received his orders from North 
and Germain, (one more absurd than the other,) 
took Galloway's opinion, shut his eyes, fought 
again, and is now I suppose, to be called to account for acting according to instructions; but, ( 
believe, his eyes are now opened; he sees he has 
been an instrument of wickedness and ibllv : indeed, when I observed it to him, he not only took 
patiently the observation, but indireetlv assented 
to the truth of it. He made, at the same time, 
as far as his mauvais honte would permit, sua apology for his treatment of me. 

Thus far with regard to Mr. Howe. You are 
struck with the great events, changes, and newcharacters which have appeared on the stage since 
I saw you last ; but I am more struck with the admirable efficacy of blunders. It seemed to be a 
trial of skill which part}- should out-do the other ; 
and it is hard to say which played the deepest 
strokes ; but it was a capital one of ours, which 
certainly gave the happy turn which affairs have 
taken. Upon my soul it was time for fortune to 
interpose, or we were inevitably lost ; but this we 
will talk over another time. I suppose we shall 
see one another at Philadelphia, very soon, in attendance. God bless you ! 

Yours affectionately, 

CHARLES LEE.

Philadelphia, Od.SOth, 1777. 

t'V HEN it is considered I hold a high rank in 
the service of one of the most respectable princes 
of Europe ; that I have been honoured with the 
trust of the second command in your army ; that 
I have hitherto served, with some reputation, as a 
soldier ; that I now stand charged, and have been 
actually tried for some of the most heinous military crimes ; and, to the astonishment, not only 
of myself, but I can venture to say, of every man 
in the army who was present at this court, and of 
every man out of the army who has read the proceedings, found guilty of these crimes : when, at 
the same time, I am/" myself inflexibly persuaded, 
that I am not only guiltless, but that the success of 
the 28th of June ought principally, in justice, to 
be ascribed to me ; I say, sir, when these circumstances are considered, it must be allowed that my 
present situation is extremely aukward; that a man 
of my military rank, lingering in suspence, whilst 
his fame and fortune are sub judice, is rather a disgraceful spectacle ; that it is natural for him to- wish, 
and reasonable for him to request, that Congress 
will no longer delay the final decision of my fate. 
An additional motive for my requesting it is, that I 
find Congress is every day growing thinner ; and, 
I confess, that I could most ardently wish, that 
the Congress was not only as complete as possible 
in numbers, but that if it was agreeable to the 
rules of the House, that the people at large might 
be admitted to form an audience when the discussion is entered into, of the justice or iniquity, wisdom or absurdity, of the sentence which has been 
passed upon me. I do now, Sir, therefore, most 
humbly, but, earnestly, entreat, that a day may be 
immediately fixed for the final determination of 
this affair. 

I am, Sir, with the greatest respect,

Philadelphia, Dec. Wth, 1778, 

Madam, 

f? HEN an officer of the respectable rank I bear 
is grossly traduced and calumniated, it is incumbent on him to clear up the affair to the world, 
with as little delay as possible. The spirit of defamation and calumny (I am sorry to say it) i^ 
grown to a prodigious and intolerable height on 
this continent. If you had accused me of a design 
to procrastinate the war, or of holding a treasonable correspondence with the enemy, I could have 
borne it : this I am used to ; and this happened to 
the great Fabius Maximus. If you had accused 
me of getting drunk as often as 1 could get liquor, 
as two Alexanders the Great have been charged 
with this vice, I should, perhaps, have sat patient 
under the imputation ; or, even if you had given 
the plainest hints, that I had stolen the soldiers' 
shirts, this I could have put up with, as the great 
Duke of Marlborough would have been an example ; or if you had contented yourself with asserting, that I was so abominable a sloven as never 
to part with my shirt, until my shirt parted with 
me, the anecdotes of my illustrious name-sake of 
Sweden* would have administered some comfort 
to me. But the calumny you have, in the fertility 
of your malicious wit, chosen to invent, is of so 
new, so unprecedented, and so hellish a kind, as 
would make Job himself swear like a Virginia 
Colonel. 

Is it possible that the celebrated Miss F s,f a lady who has had every human and divine advantage, who has read, (or, at least, might have 
read,) in the originals, the New and Old Testaments ; (though I am afraid she too seldom looks 
even into the translations:) I say, is it possible that Miss F s, with every human and divine 
advantage, who might, and ought to have read these two good books, which (an old Wesh nurse, 
whose uncle was reckoned the best preacher in Merionethshire, assured n-e) enjoins charity, and 
denou nces vengeance against slanderand evil speaking; is it possible, I again repeat it, that Miss 
F s, should, in the face of the day, carry her malignity so far, in the presence of three most respectable personages ; (one of the oldest religion 
in the world, one of the newest ; for he is a newlight man; and the other, most probably, of no 
religion at all, as he is an English sailor; but.I 
demand it again and again, is it possible, that Miss F s should assert it, in the presence of these 
respectable personages, " That I wore green breeches patched with leather ?'! To convict you, 
therefore, of the falsehood of this most diabolical slander ; to put you to eternal silence, (if you are 
not past all grace,) and to cover you with a much larger patch of infamy than you have wantonly 
endeavoured to fix on my breeches, I have thought proper, by the advice of three very grave 
friends, (lawyers and members of Congress, of course excellent judges in delicate points of honour.) to send you the said breeches, and, with 
the consciousness of truth on my side, to submit them to the most severe inspection and scrutiny of 
you and all those who may have entered into this wicked cabal against my honour and reputation. 
I say, I dare you, and your whole junto, to your worst : turn them, examine them, inside and outside, and if you find them to be green breeches 
patched with leather, and not actually legitimate sherry valties, such as his Majesty of Poland 
wears, (who, let me tell you, is a man that has made more fashions than all your knights of the 
Meschianzaf put together, notwithstanding their ladies, of whom Miss F was one. 
beauties;) I repeat it, (though I am almost out of 
breath with repetitions and parentheses,) that if 
these are proved 10 be patched green breeches, and 
not real legitimate sherry vallies, (which a man of 
the first bon ton might be proud of,) I will submit 
in silence to all the scurrility which, I have no 
doubt, you and your abettors are prepared to pour 
out against me, in the public papers, on this important and interesting occasion. But, Madam ! 
Madam! reputation (as u Common Sense," very 
sensibly, though not very uncommonly observes,) 
is a serious thing. You have already injured me 
in the tenderest part, and I demand satisfaction ; 
and as you cannot be ignorant of the laws of duelling, having conversed with so many Irish officers, 
whose favourite topic it is, particularly in the 
company of ladies, I insist on the privilege of the 
injured party, which is, to name his hour and 
weapons ; and as I intend it to be a very serious 
affair, will not admit of any seconds ; and you 
may depend upon it, Miss F s, that whatever may be your spirit on the occasion, the world 
shall never accuse General L - - with having turned 
his back upon you. In the mean time, 

I am, Yours, 

Miss F > - - - s, Philadelphia. 

P. S. I have communicated the affair only to 
my confidential friend , who has mentioned it to no more than seven members of Congress and nineteen women, six of whom are old 
maids ; so that there is no danger of its taking 
wind on my side : and, I hope, you will be equally guarded on your part.

Madam, 

.NOTHING has happened to me of late, that 
has given me more concern than the serious light 
in which I am told you are persuaded to con -ider 
the harmless jocular letter I wrote to you ; I say, 
persuaded to consider ; for, on the first receipt of 
it, when you were directed alone by your own excellent understanding, you conceived it as it was 
meant, an innocent jeu d y esprit. 

I do not mean to compliment, when I assure 
you, upon my honour, that it was the good opinion I had of your understanding which encouraged me to indulge myself in this piece of raillery, 
which is, in effect, not in the least directed against 
you, but against myself and some others; if it contains any satire, you are obviously the vehicle, not 
the object. 

My acquaintance with you is too slender to 
take any liberties which border on familiarity ; 
and I had been taught to believe, that the liberality of your mind and disposition, would be pleased with any effort to make you laugh for a moment in these melancholy times. Upon the word 
of an honest man, if I had thought a single sentence of this trash could have given you uneasiness, I would sooner have put my hand into the 
fire than have written it. Thank God, I have not 
that petulent itch of scribbling, and vain ambition 
of passing for a wit, as to 

Give virtue scandal, innocence a fear, 
Or from the soft-ey'd virgin steal a tear. 

And, to speak my real thoughts, I am thoroughly 
persuaded, that you must suffer yourself to be biassed by people infinitely your inferiors in capacity ; and if you really are offended by what nobody, who is not below mediocrity in understanding, 
can mistake for any thing but an harmless joke, 
founded on the good opinion of the person to 
whom it is addressed, I confess I have been much 
deceived in you. I must, therefore, think that by 
consulting yourself alone, you will consider it in

My DEAR SISTER, 

Pratt Rio, Sept. 24ft, lift 

JL HAVE just received your letter of January 
the 3d ; I know not whether you have received 
them, but in the course of this and the last year, 
I wrote you two letters, informing you fully of 
my health and spirits ; the two points which, from 
your natural tenderness and affection, I knew you 
must be most solicitous about ; they have both, 
thank Heaven, and the good constitution we received from our father and mother, never failed me 
a single day ; and until I am conscious of having 
committed some unworthy action, which, I can 
assure you, is not at present the case, the iniquity 
of men shall never bear me down. I have, it is 
true, uneasy feelings, but not on my own personal 
account. I feel for the empire of Great Britain, I 
feel for the fortunes of my relations and friends, 
which must receive a dreadful shock in this great 
convulsion. As to my personal honour, for I suppose you allude to the affair of Monmouth, ail I 
shall say is, that as I believe the proceedings of 
the court have been sent to England, and as you have eyes to read, and capacity to judge and make 
proper comments, I may be quite easy on the subject. 

What has not our quondam friend Gage to answer for ? I laboured at Boston, by a letter, to 
open his eyes, and he treated my efforts as the 
effects of republican insanity. Had he listened to 
me, the empire of Great Britain would have stood, 
the affections and allegiance of this great people 
continued for ages. He is, in fact, answerable for the subversion of the British empire, and 
for the blood of, at least, one hundred thousand 
Englishmen, or the immediate descendants of Englishmen. I fancy too, by this time, Lord Piercy 
and General Burgoyne lament that they considered 
my letters as the ebulition of madness or faction. 
But as my letter must be opened before it reaches 
you, any thing like politics must be improper. 
God bless you, my dear sister. My love to the 
Townshends, Hunts, Bunburys, Mrs. Hinks, and the Barrets.

My dear Sister, 

A HE other day, by a kind act of Providence, 
a letter of yours fell into my hands, of so late date 
as the 20th of March, and what is more, it had the 
appearance of never havingbeen opened. You will 
better conceive, than I can express the pleasure 
which I received from it ; for I assure you, that 
my American enthusi;^rn is at present so far worn 
off, that the greatest satisfaction I can receive, is 
to be informed of the health and welfare of my English friends, who, with all their political sins, 
corruptions and follies, still possess mere virtues, 
at least as individuals, than all the nations of the 
earth. As to the Americans, though I once 
thought otherwise, when their characters are impartially and minutely discussed, I am sure they 
will appear dot only destitute of the personal virtues and good qualities which render those they 
deseendccl from so estimable in the eyes of other 
nations, such as truth, honesty, sincerity, and 
good understanding; but, I am much mistaken, 
if the great public qualities which you at a distance 
suppose them to be endowed with, will stand a 
scrutiny ; but a scrutiny of this kind, in a letter, 
is not possible: all that I shall say is, that, the New 
England-men excepted, the rest of the Americans, 
though they fancy and call themselves republicans, 
have not a single republican qualification or idea. 
They have always a god of the day, whose infallibility is not to be disputed: to him all the people 
must bow down and sing Hosannas. 

You are curious, my dear sister, on the subject 
of my finances, and are desirous to know wht the r 
these people, to whom 1 have sacrificed every thing, 
have shewn the same black ingratitude with respect to my circumstances as they have in other 
matters ; I can assure you, then, that their actions, 
are all of a piece. Was it not for the friendship 
of Mr. Robert Morris and a fortunate purchase 
I made, more by hick than cunning, 1 might 
have begged in the streets, but without much 
chance of being relieved ; not but that, to be just 
there are many exceptions to the general character 
of the Americans, both in and out of the army, 
and I think the greater number are of the latter 
class, men of some honour, and who, I believe, 
have, from the beginning, acted on principle ; and 
all these I may, without vanity, say, have been my 
friends and advocates. Among the worthies of 
America I reckon Mr. Robert Morris of Philadelphia ; Richard Henry Lee of Virginia ; Adams and Lovel, and some others of New England; 
the Morris's of New- York ; and Dr. Rush of 
Philadelphia. In the army there are many worthy to be mentioned, Generals Schuyler, Miflin, 
Sullivan, Muhlenburgh, Wayne, Weedon, Green, 
Knox, &c. 

I have been particularly fortunate in my aid du camps — all young gentlemen of the best families, 
fortunes, and education of this continent ; but 
above all, I should mention young Colonel Harry 
Lee, who has signalized himself extremely in this 
accursed contest, the ruinous consequences of 
which to the whole empire, I predicted to Lord 
Piercy and to my friend General Burgoyne. To 
do the Americans justice, they certainly were not 
the aggressors, but the retrospect now is of no use. 
In all civil contests the people, in general, have 
not been the aggressors ; they only wish to defend, 
not to encroach. The monarchs or magnates 
generally commence by their oppressions. Witness the disputes betwixt the patricians and the 
plebeians of Rome, and our wars in the time of 
Charles the first ; but the people in the contest 
forget the principles on which they set out, which 
ultimately brings destruction on both parties ; and 
this I extremely apprehend will be the case at present. I shall now quit the labyrnths of politics, 
and return to the subject of my own finances. 
Mr. Mure has used me most cruelly and villainously : notwithstanding the vast sums he owes me, 
he has protested a bill of three hundred pounds, 
which has thrown me into unspeakable distress. 
He has affected a delicacy in honouring the bills of 
a rebel ; but if he will eonsult the proclamation 
of sir Henry Clinton, in the year seventy eight, 
he will find that I am exempted from the apprehension of confiscation by the terms of this proclamation, which declares, that no man, from the 
date hereof, who does not positively act in a civil 
or military capacity, is subject to the confiscation 
of his property ; but as 1 have reason to think 
that the man will avail himself of everv chicane, 
when money is in the case, I must entreat that 
you will urge sir Charles Bunbury and Davers 
to endeavour to influence him, at least to furnish 
Mr. Garton, for my use, with five, four, or at least 
three hundred pounds until the contest is over, 
and the law, according to the terms of peace, tells 
us what is to be done ; but, at any rate, he, Mr. 
Mure, can have no claim as an individual to my 
fortune : he must account for it to somebody. 
I am extremely concerned at the embarrasment our cousin S gives you with regard to the legacy, but it is the very error of the moon ; she 
comes more near the earth than she was wont 
to do, and makes men mad. Is my worthiest 
friend Butler alive, and amongst you ? If he is, 
a thousand blessings, in my name, on his head. 
God Almighty, my dear sis:er, give you long 
life, ease, and spirits, is devoutly the wish of 

Your most affectionate brother, 

CHARLES LEE.
