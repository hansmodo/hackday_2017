</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I did not receive your very kind and very gratifying communication of the 13th January, <a href='/results.php?year=1821'>1821</a>, until after I had rejoined my family in this place ; and consequently, not till 
after it was too late to profit, in passing homeward, of your very obliging permission to pay you my respects personally ; a satisfaction which I regret in proportion to the just sense I have of its value. 
</p><p>
Your remarks on the first volume of Botta, confirmed as they were by Presidents <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel=''>Adams</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague'>Jefferson</a>, were communicated to the reviewers of my translation of that author, 
and were by them introduced into their account of the work published in the North American Review for July, 1821. 
</p><p>
An apprehension of appearing to press with ten little consideration on your indulgent courtesy, has hitherto deterred me from solicit in your judgment of the remaining volumes. 
</p><p>
The prospect, however, of an approaching call for another edition, induces me to hazard the prayer that if your health 
and leisure admit, you would have the compli e to favour me with any remarks which may have occurred to you for the interest of truth, relative to the second and third volumes of this history. 
</p><p>
With respect to the animadversions which you did me the honour to address to me upon the first volume, and which I 
took the liberty to communicate to the late Presidents Adams and Jefferson, the former of these gentlemen wrote me as follows : 
</p><p>
"I cannot refrain from expressing the pleasure I have 
received from the reasoning of <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague'>Mr. Jay</a> upon the passage 
in Botta, ' that anterior to the revolution there existed in 
the colonies a desire of independence.' There is great ambiguity in this expression, ' there existed in the colonies a desire of independence? It is true, there always existed in the 
colonies a desire of independence of parliament in the articles of internal taxation and internal policy, and a very 
general, if not an universal opinion, that tiny were constitutionally entitled to it, and as general a determination, if 
possible, to maintain and defend it ; hut there never existed 
a desire of independence of tin; crown, or of general regulations of commerce, for the equal and impartial benefit of 
all parts of the empire. It is true, there might be times 
and circumstances in which an individual or a few individuals might entertain and express a wish, that America was 
independent in all respects ; but these were " rari nantes 
in gurgite vasto." For example, in one thousand seven hundred and fifty-six, seven, and eight, the conduct of the 
British Generals Shirley, Braddock, Loudon, Webb, and 
Abercrombie. was so absurd, disastrous, and destructive, that 
a very general opinion prevailed that the war was conducted 
by a mixture of ignorance, treachery, and cowardice ; and 
some persons wished we had nothing to do with Great 
Britain for ever. Of this number, I distinctly remember, I 
was myself one ; fully believing that we were able to defend 
ourselves against the French and Indians, without any assistance or embarrassments from Great Britain. In fifty-eight and fifty-nine, when Amherst and Wolfe had changed 
the fortune of the war, by a more able and faithful conduct 
of it, I again rejoiced in the name of Briton, and should 
have rejoiced in it to this day, had not the king and parliament committed high treason and rebellion against America, as soon as they had conquered Canada and made peace 
with France. That there existed a general desire of independence of the crown, in any part of America, before the 
revolution, is as far from truth as the zenith is from the nadir. 
The encroaching disposition of Great Britain, it was early 
foreseen by many wise men in all the States, would one day 
attempt to enslave them by an unlimited submission to parliament, and rule them with a rod of iron; that this attempt would 
produce resistance on the part of America, and an awful 
struggle, was also foreseen, but dreaded and deprecated as 
the greatest calamity that could befall them. For my own 
part, there was not a moment during the revolution when 
I would not have given every thing I possessed for a 
restoration to the state of things before the contest began, 
provided we could have had a sufficient security for its continuance," &c. &c." 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel=''>Mr. Jefferson</a> says, in fewer words, "I confirm, by my belief, <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague'>Mr. Jay</a>'s criticisms on the passages quoted from 
Botta. I can answer for its truth from this State southwardly, and northwardly I believe to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, for which 
State <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague'>Mr. Jay</a> himself is a competent witness. What, eastward of that, might have been the dispositions towards 
England before the commencement of hostilities, I know not; before that I never had heard a whisper of a 
disposition to separate from Great Britain ; and after that, its possibility was contemplated with affliction by all," &c. 
With many acknowledgments for the attentions with which you have deigned to honour my undertaking, and the 
encouraging tone with which you were pleased to cheer me on to its accomplishment. I pray you to be assured of the 
profound veneration and perfect esteem of, sir, 
</p><p>
Your much obliged, and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=geo" rel="me">George Alexander Otis</a>.
