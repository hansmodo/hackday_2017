THE 



LIFE OF JOHJV JAY. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 



TO COLONEL M'DOUGALL. 

Philadelphia, March 23d, 1776. 
Dear Colonel, 

When the clerk of the Congress gave me the printed 
papers which I enclosed you, he told me they contained the 
navy establishment. Whatever deficiencies there may be 
in them as to that matter, will I hope be supplied by the 
extract now enclosed. 

As to continental colours, the Congress have made no 
order as yet concerning them, and I believe the captains of 
their armed vessels have in that particular been directed 
by their own fancies and inclinations. I remember to have 
seen a flag designed for one of them, on which was ex- 
tremely well painted a large rattlesnake, rearing his crest 
and shaking his rattles, with this motto, " Don't tread on 
me," but whether this device was generally adopted by the 
fleet, I am not able to say, — I rather think it was not. 

I am by no means without my apprehensions of danger 
from that licentiousness which in your situation is not un- 
common ; nothing will contribute more to its suppression 
than a vigorous exertion of the powers vested in your 

VOL. II. A 



2 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

Convention and Committee of Safety, at least till more 
regular forms can be introduced. The tenderness shown 
to some wild people on account of their supposed attach- 
ment to the cause, has been of disservice. Their eccentric 
behaviour, by passing unreproved, has gained countenance, 
and has lessened your authority, and diminished that dignity 
so essential and necessary to give weight and respect to 
your ordinances. Some o£ your own people are daily 
instigated (if not employed) to calumniate and abuse the 
whole province, and misrepresent all their actions and 
intentions. One in particular has had the impudence to 
intimate to certain persons that your battalions last cam- 
paign were not half full, and that Schaick's regiment had 
more officers than privates ; others report that you have 
all along supplied the men-of-war with whatever they 
pleased to have, and through them our enemies in Boston. 
By tales like these they pay their court to people who have 
more ostensible consequence than real honesty, and more 
cunning than wisdom. 

I am happy to find that our intermeddling in the affair of 
the test is agreeable to you. For Cod's sake resist all such 
attempts for the future. 

Your own discernment has pointed out to you the prin- 
ciple of Lord Stirling's advancement ; had the age of a 
colonel's commission been a proper rule, it would have 
determined in favour of some colonel at Cambridge, many 
of whose commissions are prior in date to any in New- 
'i ork. The spirit you betray on this occasion becomes a 
soldier. 

The enclosed copy of a resolve of Congress will, I hope, 
settle all doubts relative to rank, which may arise from 
your new commission. The consequence you drew from 
that circumstance was more ingenious than solid, for I can 
assure you that the Congress were not disposed to do any 
thing wrong or uncivil ; and I can also add, that your not 
having joined your regiment last summer has been ex- 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 3 

plained to their satisfaction, as far as I am able to judge. 
"With respect to this, however, as well as some other mat- 
ters, I shall defer particulars till we meet. In a word, with 
some men in these as in other times, a man must either be 
their tool and be despised, or act a firm disinterested part 
and be abused. The latter has in one or two matters 
been your fate, as well as that of many other good men. 
Adieu. 

I am, dear sir, 

Your friend, 

John Jay. 

to col. m'dolgall, 

Philadelphia, 27th April, 1776. 

Dear Colonel, 

Accept my thanks for your friendly letter of the 16th 
instant, and its enclosures, which contain useful as well as 
agreeable information. I am glad to see New York doing 
something in the naval way, and think the encouragement 
given by your Convention to the manufacture of arms, 
powder, saltpetre, and sea salt, does them honour. 

Many of the reasons you allege for delaying taxation are 
weighty, and I confess did not occur to me. It is certainly 
unreasonable to impose on the city, in its present circum- 
stances, so great a share of the public expenses. 

The late election, so far as it respects yourself, has taken 
a turn I did not expect, and am at a loss to account for, 
except on the principle of your holding a military office, or 
that mutability which from various causes often strongly 
marks popular opinions of men and measures in times like 
these. But whatever may have been the reason, I am per- 
suaded that the zeal you have shown and the sacrifices you 
have made in this great cause will always afford you the 
most pleasing reflections, and will one day not only merit, 
but receive the gratitude of your fellow-citizens. Posterity 
you know always does justice. Let no circumstances of 



4 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

this kind diminish your ardour ; but by persevering in a 
firm, uniform course of conduct, silence detraction and 
compel approbation. 

I am much obliged to you for your kind attention to my 
house ; and be assured that I shall omit no opportunity of 
evincing the esteem and sincerity with which I am 
Your friend and humble servant, 

John Jay. 

from robert r. livingston. 

Claremount, 20th March, 1776. 
Dear John, 
Your letters of 26th Jan., 25th Feb., and 4th inst., are 
all before me. They are written with so much friendship 
and affection as to afford me great consolation, and con- 
vince me, notwithstanding my heavy losses, that in you I 
have more left than falls to the lot of most of my fellow- 
mortals. May the blessing be continued to me, and I know 
how to value it. 

I sympathize most sincerely with you in your melancholy 
apprehensions about your parents. X know and I can feel 
such a loss ; but you draw your consolation from a never- 
failing source, which will enable you to bear this misfortune 
whenever it shall happen, with that resignation to the will 
of Heaven which becomes one who is satisfied both of its 
wisdom and goodness. If we could shake off human frailty 
in the hour of allliction, we should certainly think it less 
reasonable to lament the death of a ffood man than to com- 
plain of the absence of a friend, who by that absence infi- 
nitely increases his happiness ; to wish them back is selfish 
and unworthy of true friendship, and yet we may, we must 
grieve when we arc not permitted to take leave. It is, I 
am sensible, a weakness, but I cannot help suffering my- 
self to be afflicted at this circumstance. I know the plea- 
sure that the best of fathers always took in my company 
and conversation ; and when I indulge the thought, I am un- 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 5 

happy that by my absence I lessened any of his enjoyments. 
But where am I running — God bless you — farewell. 

Your friend, 
Robert R. Livingston. 

FROM ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Philadelphia, 21st May, 1776. 
Dear John, 
I am much mortified at not hearing from you. I wrote 
to you last week, and am just now setting out for Bristol 
in order to meet Mrs. Livingston. I could wish to find 
Mrs. Jay there also. Pray send some of our colleagues 
along, otherwise I must be more confined than either my 
health or inclination will allow. You have doubtless seen 
the account brought by the Rifleman from London, by 
which it appears we shall have at least 34,000 commis- 
sioners. 

If your Congress have any spirit, they will at least build 
fourteen or fifteen light boats capable of carrying a twelve- 
pounder, to secure Hudson River, which is to be the chief 
scene of action. The carpenters employed on the frigate 
would build two or three a day, if they w r ere built in the 
manner of batteaux, which is the true construction. 

I wish you would direct Gaine to send me his paper. 
God bless you. 

Yours, most sincerely, 

R. R. Livingston. 

TO R. R. LIVINGSTON. 

New-York, 29th May, 1776. 
Dear Robert, 

The pleasure I expected from a junction of all our fami- 
lies at Bristol has vanished. Dr. Bard tells me the waters 
there would be injurious to Mrs. Jay's complaints ; so that 
I shall again take a solitary ride to Philadelphia, whenever 



b LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

the Convention, who directed me to abide here until their 
further order, shall think proper to dismiss me. 

Messrs. Also]) and Lewis set out next Saturday for 
Philadelphia. 3Ir. Duane informs me that he is about to 
return home, and considering how long he has been absent 
from his family, I think him entitled to that indulgence. I 
pray God that your health may enable you to attend con- 
stantly, at least till it may be in my power to relieve you. 
Is Mr. Clinton returned? 

Our Convention will, I believe, institute a better govern- 
ment than the present, which in my opinion will no longer 
work an}' thing but mischief; and although the measure of 
obtaining authority by instructions may have its advocates, 
I have reason to think that such a resolution will be taken 
as will open a door to the election of new or additional 
members. But be the resolution what it may, you shall 
have the earliest advice of it. And should my conjectures 
prove right, I shall inform the members of Duchess of your 
readiness to serve, and advise them to elect you. 

Don't be uneasy at receiving so few letters from me. I 
have been so distressed by the ill health of my wife and 
parents, that I have scarce written any thing. 

I am, dear Robert, your affectionate friend, 

John Jay. 

to edward rutledge.* 

Fishkill, 11th Oct., 1776. 
Dear Rutledge, 

Be so kind as to forward the enclosed by the first oppor- 
tunity to your brother. It is in answer to one from him to 
Messrs. Duane, Wm. Livingston, and myself, mentioning 
the losses sustained by General Lee in consequence of 
entering into the American service, and recommending a 
compliance with the resolution of Congress for indemnify-

ing him. As he has doubtless written to you on the subject, 
I forbear enlarging on the propriety, policy, or justice of the 
measure. I am for my own part clear for it, and wish with 
all my heart that it may take place: I shall write to my 
colleagues on the subject. 

Let no considerations induce you to excuse General 
Mifflin from the office of quarter-master-general. Moyland 
acted wisely and honestly in resigning. Try no new ex- 
periments : you have paid for the last. Let me repeat it — 
keep Mifflin. 

Although extremely anxious to be with you, the circum- 
stances of this State will not admit of my leaving it. Gov- 
ernor Tryon has been very mischievous ; and we find our 
hands full in counteracting and suppressing the conspiracies 
formed by him and his adherents. 

What is your fleet and noble admiral doing ? What 
meekness of wisdom and what tender-hearted charity ! I 
can't think of it with patience. Nothing but more than 
lady-like delicacy could have prevailed on your august body 
to secrete the sentence they passed upon that pretty genius. 
I reprobate such mincing, little, zigzag ways of doing 
business : either openly acquit, or openly condemn. 

If General Lee should be at Philadelphia, pray hasten 
his departure — he is much wanted at New- York. I wish 
our army w r ell stationed in the highlands, and all the lower 
country desolated ; we might then bid defiance to all the 
further efforts of the enemy on that quarter. 

I am, my dear Rutledge, 

Your friend, 

John Jay. 

from edward rutledge. 

Philadelphia, Nov. 24th, 1776. 

My dear Jay, 

I expected long ere this to have been seated quietly at 
home ; but the progress which the enemy had made, and 



8 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

seemed likely to make, into your country, induced me to 
suspend my resolution which I came to several months ago, 
and assist with the whole of my power (lktle enough, God 
knows) a State which appeared to be marked for destruc- 
tion. The storm, however, has passed away ; and though I 
have reason to dread its bursting upon the heads of my 
countrymen, I cannot but most sincerely congratulate you 
upon the event. I wish you may improve the time ; and if 
you can concur with me in sentiment, it will be improved 
in the following manner. Let Schuyler, whose reputation 
has been deeply wounded by the malevolence of party spirit, 
immediately repair to Congress, and after establishing him- 
self in the good opinion of his countrymen, by a fair and 
open inquiry into his conduct, concert with the House such 
a plan as he shall think will effectually secure all the upper 
country against the attacks of the enemy ; which plan being 
agreed to by the House, give him full power to effect it, 
and send him off with all possible despatch to carry it into 
execution. Let steps be taken to place real obstructions in 
the North River, at least in that part of it which can be com- 
manded by Fort Montgomery, and the other fort in the 
highlands. If these things be done, and that soon, your 
country, I think, will be safe ; provided you establish a 
good government, with a strong executive. A pure de- 
mocracy may possibly do, when patriotism is the ruling 
passion; but when the State abounds with rascals, as is the 
case with too many at this day, you must suppress a little 
of that popular spirit. Vest the executive powers of gov- 
ernment in an individual, that they may have vigour, and 
let them be as ample as is consistent with the great outlines 
of freedom. As several of the reasons which operated 
mst you or Livingston's leaving the State are now 
removed, I think you would be of vast service in Congress. 
\ ou know that body possesses its share of human weak- 
ness ; and that it is not impossible for the members of that 
House to have their attention engrossed by subjects which 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 9 

might as well be postponed for the present, while such as 
require despatch have been — I had almost said — neglected. 
This may he the case with the measures which should be 
taken. for the defence of your State. It is therefore your 
interest and your duty, if you are not prevented by some 
superior public concern, to attend the House, and that soon : 
you have a right to demand their attention, and I trust they 
will give you early assistance. 

Every intelligence from New- York for the last ten days 
convincing me that the enemy are preparing to attack 
the State with a large body of troops, I shall take the wings 
of the morning and hasten to mv native home ; where I 
shall endeavour to render my country more service in the 
field, than I have been able to render her in the cabinet. I 
have therefore little time to write, and none to lengthen this 
letter. I could not, however, think of quitting this part of 
the continent without writing you what appeared to me of 
consequence ; especially when I consider that it is probable, 
at least possible, that this may be the last time I may have 
it in my power to give you any evidence of my affection. 
I shall add no more than that you have my best wishes for 
your happiness, and that if I fall in the defence of my 
country, it will alleviate my misfortune to think that it is in 
the support of the best of causes, and that I am esteemed by 
one of the best of men. God bless you. Adieu, my friend. 

Yours, sincerely, 

E. RUTLEDGE. 

FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

[Private.] 

Middlebrook, March 1st, 1777. 

Dear Sir, 

I have been a little surprised, that the several important 
pieces of intelligence lately received from Europe (such 
parts of it. I mean, as are circulated without reserve in con- 
versation), have not been given to the public in a manner 

VOL. II. B 



10 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

calculated to attract the attention and impress the minds of 
the people. As they are now propagated, they run through 
the country in a variety of forms, are confounded in the 
common mass of general rumours, and lose a real part of 
their effect. It would certainly be attended with many 
valuable consequences if they could be given to the people 
in some more authentic and pointed manner. It would 
assist the measures taken to restore our currency, promote 
the recruiting of the army and our other military arrange- 
ments, and give a certain spring to our affairs in general. 

Congress may have particular reasons for not communi- 
cating the intelligence officially (which would certainly be 
the best mode if it could be done), but if it cannot, it were 
to be wished that as much as is intended to be commonly 
known could be published in as striking a way, and with as 
great an appearance of authority as may be consistent with 
propriety. 

I have taken the liberty to trouble you with this hint, as 
sometimes things the most obvious escape attention. If 
you agree with me in sentiment, you will easily fall upon 
the most proper mode for answering the purpose. 
With great esteem and regard, I am, dear sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

Geo. Washington.

New-York, 22d March, 1777. 
Dear Sir, 

Your obliging letters of the 18th ult. and 3d inst., after 

passing through various hands and places, were at length 

delivered to me two days ago. Your elegant panegyric 

on the amiable character and benevolent designs of his 

Britannic majesty meets with general approbation ; and 

some do not hesitate to predict that it will stimulate your 

gracious prince to embrace the first opportunity of exalting 

you. On reading the proclamation against picking and

stealing, I could not forbear wishing there had been one 
pasted on the foreheads of our late protectors. Nothing 
but the chance of their being predestined to go to heaven 
can save them from a campaign in the opposite regions. 
The least they can expect, with any degree of modesty, is 
to be decimated. They seem to have acted as if they 
thought themselves tenants in common in all the good 
things they met with, and that posterior, instead of prior 
occupancy, enabled them to hold in severalty. 

At a time when the most strenuous efforts are necessary 
to our political salvation, it is to be regretted that any of 
our measures should bear the marks of feeble or dispirited 
counsels. Your militia bill should have been so framed as 
to give birth to strong and decisive executive powers. I 
should have thought the spirit of the speech, added to the 
remembrance of the barbarous ravages of the enemy, 
would have diffused through the Legislature a degree of 
resentment, determination, and enthusiasm, which would 
have been productive of regulations better adapted to the 
times. 

I am, my dear sir, 
With the greatest respect and esteem, 

Your most obedient servant, 

John Jay. 

to mrs. jay. 

Kingston, 25th March, 1777. 
My dear Sally, 

Accept my thanks for your affectionate letters of the 17th 
and 21st instant. I am happy to hear of the health of your- 
self and son, and am pleased with your candour and sin- 
cerity on that subject. 

We have lately received an uncertain, though unpleasant, 
account of the enemy's landing at Peekskill. How did 
your nerves bear the shock ? My father and mother, I 
apprehend, were very uneasy. I should be happy, were it 



12 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

in my power, to bear all their as well as your misfortunes. 
The infirmities of age, added to the terrors and calamities 
of war, conspire in depriving them of ease and enjoyment. 
I most sensiBly feel for and pity them. God grant them the 
only remedy against the evils inseparable from humanity — 
fortitude founded on resignation. The moment I may 
suspect you to be exposed to clanger I shall set out for Fish- 
kill. As yet I think you very safe ; for, if the reports we 
have heard be true, the enemy's force is not sufficient to 
penetrate the country. 

I congratulate Peter on his recovery and return. Re- 
mind him of sending to Captain Piatt's for the barley. Let 
not the fear of the enemy deter him from pursuing the busi- 
ness of the farm. The same Providence which enables us 
to sow may enable us to reap. 

I am, my dear wife, 

Your very affectionate 

John Jay. 

to leonard gansevoort. 

Kingston, 5th June, 1777. 
Dear Sir, 

Mr. Cuyler informs me, that some of my friends in your 
county have done me the honour of naming me, among 
other candidates, for the office of governor. 

In my opinion I can be more useful in the place I now 
hold ; and therefore, though the other is far more respecta- 
ble as well as lucrative, yet, sir, the regard due to the pub- 
lic good induces me to decline this promotion. 

I thought it necessary that you and others should be 
informed of my sentiments on this subject ; and it would 
give me pleasure to hear, that the electors in Albany had 
united in a design of voting for some one gentleman whose 
spirit, abilities, and reputation might recommend him to 
that important office. 

Our constitution is universally approved, even in New- 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 13 

England, where few New- York productions have credit. 
But, unless the government be committed to proper hands, 
it will be weak and unstable at home, and contemptible 
abroad. For my own part, I know of no person at present 
whom I would prefer to General Schuyler. 

I am, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and humble servant, 

John Jay. 

to MRS. JAY. 

Kingston, Sunday, 6th July, 1777. 

My dear Sally, 

Having a few leisure hours allotted, me by this day of 
general rest, I shall divide them between Heaven and your- 
self ; being persuaded that while I do my duty to both, my 
expectations of happiness will not be vain. 

When I consider that one of the reasons assigned for the 
creation of woman was, " that it is not good for man to be 
alone," I find my present situation condemned, not only by 
my own feelings, but by divine authority. I assure you, 
I am tired of it ; and, were there not many reasons to con- 
jecture that the enemy will bend their course this way, we 
should not remain much longer separated ; but, as it would 
be cruel to expose you to scenes of anxiety and distress, I 
must endeavour to bear your absence at least with patience, 
and to please myself with the expectation of shortly seeing 
the return of those happy days, when we shall again " sit 
under our own vine, and under our own fig-tree, and there 
be none to make us afraid." 

As soon as the Council of Safety dissolves, which will be 
at the meeting of the Legislature, you may expect to see 
me for a few days ; but when that event will take place is 
uncertain. Should this State become the seat of war, and 
be attacked on both sides, it will not be practicable to con- 
vene the Legislature, nor indeed would it be proper for me, 
in such a conjuncture, to be absent. 



14 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

As the enemy are now expelled from Jersey, and Liberty 
Hall is again free, I fancy Susan has become as joyous as 
ever, and that the whole family arc not a little anxious to 
put an end to their exile. 

I returned last Wednesday from Fishkill. My father 
declines fast. His late loss affects him exceedingly ; he 
gives way to silence and retirement, spending hours every 
day in that melancholy room ; and though he appears calm 
and resigned, the effects of this inauspicious event are visi- 
ble upon him. How few possess such sensibility, or are 
capable of affections so permanent and so delicate ! 

Whenever leisure and opportunity offer, remember, my 
dear Sally, how acceptable a line from you always is to 
Your very affectionate husband, 

John Jay. 

from general schuyler. 

Saratoga, November 6th, 1777. 

My Dear Sir, 

When I did myself the pleasure to write you on the 17th 
ult., I was not apprized of the enemy's progress up Hudson's 
River, nor of the barbarous devastation they have been 
guilty of committing at Kingston, and other places in the 
vicinity. It is no consolation to me that I have so many 
fellow-sufferers : I feel, however, a very sensible one, in 
the fate which has attended General Burgoyne. 

Is it not probable that the enemy, in a future campaign, 
will make another attempt to sail up Hudson River? If 
they do, and at the same time attack the Eastern States, 
will there not be a want of bread in those States 1 As in 
that case little or none can be conveyed to that quarter, 
would it not be prudent to form very considerable maga- 
zines of flour on the east side of the Green Mountains ? And 
does it not appear necessary to throw such obstructions in 
Hudson River, as to render it impracticable for shipping to 
penetrate beyond the highlands 1 Perfectly to obstruct the 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 15 

navigation of Hudson River is certainly a very arduous 
task, but not attended with so many difficulties as may at 
first view be imagined. And I am persuaded, that a spir- 
ited director, at the head of four hundred men, would 
completely prepare every thing in the course of the winter, 
so as to sink the works in the course of six weeks after the 
ice shall have quitted the river. The British engineers and 
officers confess, that if the works in the Lake, at Ticonde- 
l, had been completed, it would have been impossible to 
have opened a passage in less than ten days, if they had 
been possessed of every requisite for such a business, and 
if not the least molestation had been given them. Very 
early in the war I urged the necessity of securing Hudson 
River ; I have repeated my wish more than once, and I 
shall be extremely happy to see a business completely ex- 
ecuted, on which I am persuaded much of the safety of the 
United States in general, and this in particular, depends. 
If I had any interest with the Senate and Assembly, I should 
venture to address them on the subject ; but as I have not, 
I must leave it to you, if yon are in sentiment with me on 
the necessity of the work, to mention it to your friends in 
both Houses. 

As I shall shortly be altogether out of public life, I am 
earnestly engaged in building me a house at this place, that 
I may be as far out of the noise and bustle of the great 
world as possible. I am confident (provided we repel the 
enemy), that I shall enjoy more true felicity in my retreat, 
than ever w T as experienced by any man engaged in public 
life. My hobby-horse has long been a country life ; I dis- 
mounted with reluctance, and now saddle him again with a 
very considerable share of satisfaction (for the injurious 
world has not been able to deprive me of the best source of 
happiness, the approbation of my own heart), and hope to 
canter him gently on to the end of the journey of life. 

When Congress will send for me to inquire into my con- 
duct, I cannot even make a guess at. I have entreated that 



16 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

it may be soon, and respectfully observed, that from my 
past services I ought not to remain longer than needs must 
be in the disagreeable situation in which I now stand. 

Where are you lodged — and where is your father's fam- 
ily ? Can I be of any service 1 Some tory tenants of mine 
have lost fine farms, either for grain or stock, between this 
and Albany ; two or three of them in good fence, with small 
tenements on them. If these or any of them can be of any 
use, I am sure they are much at your service. What fur- 
ther buildings are necessary may be cheaply and speedily 
erected, as the frame of a whole house can be sawed, boards 
and every other material procured at the cheapest rates. 
I will not let any of these farms, except such as I am con- 
fident would not do for you, until I have the pleasure of hear- 
ing from you ; or rather, until I have had the happiness of 
giving you a bed in the new house, which I began upon on 
the 1st instant, and which will be under cover, and have 
two rooms finished by the 15th instant, unless the weather 
should prove remarkably wet : but observe that it is only a 
frame house, sixty feet long, twenty-one broad, and two 
stories high, filled in with brick. 

I hope pains will be taken to recruit our army ; we ought 
not to grow negligent, and trust too much to our good for- 
tune : there is danger in too much confidence, and I appre- 
hend that Britain, like a desperate gamester whose affairs 
are on the brink of ruin, will make a bold push to retrieve 
the loss, if yet it is possible. 

Pray make my compliments to the governor, the chan- 
cellor, speaker, R. Yates, and such other of my friends as 
are in your quarter. I do not mention Morris, because I 
hear he is gone to relieve Mr. Duane. It is rather hard 
upon the latter to be obliged to such a constant attendance. 
Adieu : my best wishes attend you through life. 

I am, dear sir, with great esteem and affection, 

Your obedient humble servant, 
Philip Schuyler.

Fishkill, 11th Dec, 1777. 
Dear General, 

Your very friendly letter of the 6th ult. was this moment 
delivered. I am happy to find your firmness unimpaired, 
and your attachment to your country unabated by its in- 
gratitude. Justice will yet take place, and I do not despair 
of seeing the time when it will be confessed that the founda- 
tion of our success in the northern department, was laid by 
the present commander's predecessor. I am nevertheless 
anxious that such authentic evidence of the propriety of 
your conduct, should be transmitted to posterity as may 
contradict the many lies which will be told them by writers 
under impressions and under an influence unfriendly to 
your reputation. This subject merits attention. Facts, 
and not a single resolution of Congress, will in my opinion 
be effectual to do the business. I have thought much of 
this matter, but more of this when we meet. 

Your offer of a farm, &c, is very obliging : be pleased 
to accept my thanks for it. I am at present at a loss how 
to determine. Let not my delay, however, be injurious to 
you. This place, at which all the family now reside, is by 
no means agreeable or convenient, if secure, which is also 
doubtful. I purpose doing myself the pleasure of seeing 
you this winter, and shall then avail myself of your advice. 

The rapidity with which the desolation of your seat at 
Saratoga is repairing, does not surprise me. I remember 
the despatch with which the preparations for our first expe- 
dition into Canada were completed. I wish the repair of 
our forts, &c., in the river was in the same train. 

As to your loss of influence among a certain body, it is 
less so than you may imagine. The virtuous and sensible 
still retain their former sentiments. The residue ever will 
be directed by accident and circumstances. Few possess 
honesty or spirit enough openly to defend unpopular merit,

and by their c permit calumny to gain strength, 

These, however, are temporary evils, and you do well to 
despise them. 

I am, my dear sir, very sincerely,

from gouverneur morris. 

Camp, Valley Forge, Feb. 1st, 1773. 

Dear Jay, 
Congress have sent me here, in conjunction with some- 
other gentlemen, to regulate their army, and in truth not a 
little regulation hath become necessary. Our quarter- 
master and commissary departments are in the most lament- 
able situation. Opportunities have been neglected last 
campaign which were truly golden ones, but omnipotent 
fatality had, it seems, determined that the American capital 
should fall. Our sentiments on this occasion are so per- 
fectly coincident that I will not enlarge. The mighty Senate 
of America is not what you have known it. The conti- 
nental currency and Congress have both depreciated, but in 
the hands of the Almighty Architect of empires, the stone 
which the builders have rejected may easily become head 
of the corner. The free, open, and undisturbed communi- 
cation with the city of Philadelphia debauches the minds 
of those in its vicinage with astonishing rapidity. O, this 
State is sick even unto the death, and in Sir William they 
have certainly got a most damnable physician. Just before 
the reduction of the forts, the enemy balanced exactly upon 
the point of quitting the city, and a straw w r ould have 
turned in either scale. Our troops ; Heu miseros ! The 
skeleton of an army presents itself to our eyes in a naked, 
starving condition, out of health, out of spirits. But I 
have seen Fort George in the summer of 1777. Next 
campaign I believe we shall banish these troublesome fel- 
lows. For Heaven's sake, my dear friend, exert yourself

strenuously in the great leading business of taxation. To 
that great wheel "a thousand petty spokes and small annex- 
ments are morticed and adjoined." I earnestly entreat you 
and my other friends, fortia opponere pectora to that fatal 
system of limitation, which, if carried into execution, would 
be downright ruin, and in the ineffectual attempt will carry 
us to the brink of it. Yorktown and its neighbourhood) 
although nearly ninety miles from Philadelphia, already 
considers our money almost as waste paper. At taverns, 
take as specimen the following rates : breakfast and supper 
each, seven shillings and sixpence ; dinner, ten shillings ; 
one night's hay for one horse, seven shillings and sixpence; 
oats, per quart, one shilling ; toddy, per bowl, ten shillings ; 
rum, per gill, seven shillings and sixpence; wine, per bottle, 
from thirty to forty shillings, and the like ; you will observe 
this is proclamation. Hay, they tell me, hath been sold in 
some places at £20 proc. per ton. My love to Livingston. 
I shall write to him by this opportunity, if I can find time 
to send a long letter, which, indeed, 1 owe him. Remem- 
ber me to Mrs. Jay, and believe me, yours,

Poughkeepsie, 12th February, 1778. 

Dear General, 

I hope you will seriously determine to serve your country, 
at least in a legislative capacity. Class yourself with those 
great men of antiquity, who, unmoved by the ingratitude 
of their country, omitted no opportunities of promoting the 
public weal. In this field malice cannot prevent your 
reaping laurels, and remember that the present state of our 
affairs offers you a plentiful harvest. Set about it then, my 
dear sir, in earnest. I know not w T ho will be the bearer of 
this letter, and therefore forbear enlarging. 
I am, dear sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

John Jay. 



20 LIFE OP JOHN JAY. 



TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

26th February, 1778. 

Dear Sir, 

As an opportunity of going to Albany will not probably 
be given me during the session of the Legislature, and as I 
have too long kept you in suspense relative to the farm you 
was so kind as to offer me, I ought now to acquaint you 
that I am under a necessity of denying myself the pleasure 
of being your neighbour. My father's infirmities have so 
increased as to render a removal to Saratoga so incon- 
veniert and painful, if practicable, that he cannot prevail 
upon himself to undertake it. So that, my dear sir, filial 
obligations will constrain me to continue in his neighbour- 
hood. 

He is greatly obliged by your friendly offer, and believe 
me, it will ever excite the gratitude of your obliged and 

Affectionate friend and servant, 

John Jay. 

to gouverneur morris. 

11th March, 1778. 

Dear Morris, 

Your favour of the 1st of February came to hand last 
week. It gives me pleasure to hear you was then at head- 
quarters, especially on business so important and perplexed. 
It is time that inquiries, as well as punishments, should be- 
come more frequent. I wish better, or rather more, use 
was made of courts-martial. Why is the inquiry directed 
to be made into the causes to which we are to ascribe the 
loss of fort Montgomery, &c, so long delayed. Had it 
been immediately after that event took place, the river 
would now have been well fortified, and a general at the 
head of the troops in the southern part of the State. 

Pennsylvania, I believe, is sick unto death. It will never- 
theless recover, though perhaps not soon. Weak and bad 
constitutions incline to chronical disorders. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 21 

Were I sure that this letter would reach you uninspected, 
I should commit many things to paper worth your know- 
ledge, but which would give you little pleasure or surprise ; 
but as it is uncertain who will be the bearer, they must be 
reserved for the present. God bless you, and give you 
diligence and patience. Where you arc, both are necessary. 

I am your friend, 

John Jav. 

from gouverneur morris. 

Yorktown, 28th April, 177S. 

D 3'R Jay, 

I won't dispute who has written most. I have written 
more than twice what you acknowledge to have received, 
but this is of no consequence. 

I am sorry for your session, but I wished you had marked 
out what taxes have been laid, what salaries given, and a 
few more striking outlines of legislation. These, with what 
I know of your men, would have enabled me to imagine 
proper lig' ts and shades. 

I choose that my friends should write freely, and those 
who know me must know that such freedoms need no 
apology. I never thought the person you allude to so 
steady as could be wished. We have all of us our weak 
sides ; would to God that were the worst. 

What you mention relative to our plan of rights shall be 
attended to. I am a busy man, though, as heretofore, a 
pleasurable one. 

Let your governor cleanse the Augean stable in his State, 
which no public body would do though it stink under their 
noses. I am labouring at arrangements of various kinds. 
God prosper me, and give me patience and industry. It 
was a good wish from one who knew my wants. 

We have ordered troops from the highlands, but we will 
send thither a general, who shall be empowered to call forth

the swarms of the eastern hive. Men were necessary at 
the Valley Forge. I have a good knack at guessing. I 
guess the enemy won't attempt Hudson River. 

I do think of Vermont : and unless I mistake, matters 
shall be managed to effect, without bellowing in the forum, 
which I believe hath been a little too much the case. But 
why should I blame impetuous vivacity, — hath it never led 
me into an error ? 

Putnam will soon be tried. The affair of Schuyler and 
St. Clair laboured under awkward circumstances. Their 
friends and their enemies appear to me to have been equally 
blind. I enclose extracts from the minutes made the other 
night to possess myself of the real state of facts. There are 
some other entries from time to time. It was erroneous to 
order a committee simply to collect facts ; they should have 
been directed to state charges. This morning, my colleague 
being absent, I got a committee appointed for the latter 
purpose : Sherman, Dana (Massachusetts), and Drayton 
(South Carolina). This was unanimous, and yet I would 
have undertaken to argue for it in a style which would ab- 
solutely have ruined the measure. You know it would have 
been easy to say, justice to those injured gentlemen, instead 
of justice to an injured country requires, &c. 

Great Britain seriously means to treat. Our affairs are 
most critical, though not dangerously so. If the minister 
from France were present as well as him from England, I 
am a blind politician if the thirteen States (with their ex- 
tended territory), would not be in peaceable possession of 
their independence three months from this day. As it is, 
expect a long war. I believe it will not require such aston- 
ishing efforts after this campaign to keep the enemy at bay. 
Probably a treaty is signed with the house of Bourbon ere 
this ; if so, a spark hath fallen upon the train which is to 
fire the world. Ye gods ! what havoc doth ambition make 
among your works.

My dear friend, adieu. My love to your wife, lie- 
member me to all my friends of every rank" and sex.

GoLVERNELR MoRRIS. 

P.S. I meant to have said, the present is within the 
spirit of our constitution, a special occasion. 

TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Albany, April 29th, 1778. 
Dear Morris, 

My last to you was written about a week ago. I am 
now engaged in the most disagreeable part of my duty, 
trying criminals. They multiply exceedingly. Robberies 
become frequent : the woods afford them shelter, and the 
tories food. Punishments must of course become certain, 
and mercy dormant — a harsh system, repugnant to my 
feelings, but nevertheless necessary. In such circumstances 
lenity would be cruelty, and severity is found on the side 
of humanity. 

The influence of Lord North's conciliatory plan is hap- 
pily counterbalanced by the intelligence from France. 
There was danger of its creating divisions. A desire of 
peace is natural to a harassed people ; and the mass of 
mankind prefer present ease to the arduous exertions often 
necessary to ensure permanent tranquillity. 

What the French treaty may be, I know not. If Britain 
would acknowledge our independence, and enter into a 
liberal alliance with us, I should prefer a connexion with 
her to a league with any power on earth. Whether those 
objects be attainable, experience only can determine. I 
suspect the commissioners will have instructions to exceed 
their powers, if necessary. Peace, at all events, is, in my 
opinion, the wish of the minister. I hope the present favour- 
able aspect of our affairs will neither make us arrogant or 
careless. Moderation in prosperity marks great minds, 



24 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

and denotes a generous people. Your game is now in a 
delicate situation, and the least bad play may ruin it. I 
view a return to the domination of Britain with horror, and 
would risk all for independence ; but that point ceded, I 
would give them advantageous commercial terms. The 
destruction of Old England would hurt me ; I wish it well : 
it afforded my ancestors an asylum from persecution. 

Parties here are still in a ferment. I hope it will be the 
means of purging off much scum and dross. I can't be par- 
ticular. This letter may never reach you. 

I expect in a few days to see General Schuyler ; and 
my importunities shall not be wanting to urge him to 
join you without delay. The people grow more reconciled 
to him. 

The military departments here, I believe, are well man- 
aged. The commissary deserves credit. Handsome things 
are said of the quarter-master ; and there is one at the 
head of the artillery, who appears to me to have much 
merit. The park elaboratory and stores are in high order. 
There is the appearance of regularity, care, and attention 
in all the public works. As \<> the hospital I can say little, 
not being as yet well-informed. Conway is pleased with 
Schuyler, and manages the Vermont troops properly ; but 
of this say nothing. I fancy he does not well understand 
the views of his patron. Neither of them ought to know 
this. 

The clothier-general, once the Duke of Bolton's butler, 
is an anti-Washington. An ignorant butcher is issuing 
commissary. Let me again hint to you the propriety of 
restraining the staff from trade : besides general reasons, 
there are particular ones. Many good cannon remain yet 
at Ticonderoga — strange neglect. Remember Vermont. 
Why do the marine committee keep Tudor in pay? I 
can't hear that he does any thing for it. 

I am, and will be your friend, 

John Jay. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 25 



FROM EDWARD RUTLEDGE. 

Charleston, Dec. 25th, 1778. 
My dear Jay, 

It is a long time since we have had any correspondence, 
but I see no reason why it should be longer, when we have 
any thing to say, and leisure to say if, in. Such is just my 
situation ; for it is Christmas-day, and all the world (i. e. 
my clients) being either at their devotions or their amuse- 
ments, I have time to tell you, and I fear with some 
reason (as it comes north about), that a damned infamous 
cabal is forming against our commander-in-chief, and that 
whenever they shall find themselves strong enough they 
will strike an important blow. I give you this hint, that 
you may be on your guard ; and I know you will excuse me 
for doing so, when you recollect that there are some men 
of our acquaintance who are in possession of all the quali- 
ties of the devil, his cunning n< >t excepted. Recollect the 
indirect attempts that were repeatedly made against the 
command and reputation of poor Schuyler, and the fatal 
stab that was at last aimed at both; and let us be taught 
how necessary it is to oppose a cabal in its infancy. Were 
it in my power, I would stifle it in its birth. Conway, the 
****, and ******* are said to be at the bottom of this, 
besides an abundance of snakes that are concealed in the 
grass. If these are not encouraged to come forward, they 
will continue where they are ; but if the former are per- 
mitted to bask in the sunshine of Congressional favour, the 
latter will soon spread themselves abroad, and an extended 
field will be immediately occupied by the factious and 
the ambitious. The fate of America will then be like the 
fate of most of the republics of antiquity, where the design- 
ing have supplanted the virtuous, and the worthy have been 
sacrificed to the views of the wicked. Indeed, my friend, 
if the Congress do not embrace every opportunity to extin- 
guish that spirit of cabal and unworthy ambition, it will

finally be more essentially injurious to the well-being of 
this continent than the sword of Sir Harry and his whole 
army. I view the body of which we were for a long time 
members, as possessing, in a very eminent degree, the 
powers of good and evil. It depends on those who manage 
the machine to determine its object. I hear you have 
returned to Congress, and I hope you will have your full 
share in the management. I do not know what gentleman 
we shall send from this State. We have some fine plants, 
nay, saplings, that will do wondrous well in a few years, 
but are too tender at present to bear up the weight of this 
continent. Were it now to be imposed upon them, it might 
check their growth, or, as they are the production of a 
southern clime, it is possible they might be blighted by a 
northern wind. When you write me, let me know how 
Robert R. Livingston is. Remember me to him, for I 
esteem him highly. God bless you, my dear Jay, and 
believe me to be, with great sincerity, 

Your affectionate friend, 

Edward Rutledge.

Philadelphia, 13th January, 1779. 
Dear Robert, 

Not a single line have you received from me since my 
arrival. This, you may say, does not look very friendly. 
I confess it, and, what is more in my favour, feel it. 

Business, I know, cannot excuse a total silence, though it 
may palliate a partial one. I won't plead it, for I never 
admitted it ; nor do I now write merely to keep fair with 
my own principles. Inclination, more than consistency, 
prompts me on this occasion. 

I presume your Legislature is by this time convened. 
Now is the season for exertion. Attend regularly. Con- 
firm those who esteem you and their country. Convert or 
confound those who would sacrifice either to private views. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 27 

Will any consideration induce you to visit another quar- 
ter of the globe ? I don't know that you will be called 
upon, but 1 am not sure that you may not. My conduct 
will be greatly influenced by your inclination. 

I had almost persuaded myself to write a letter to your 
brother Nod, urging him to come to this college, and offer- 
ing my service to prepare the way for his reception. But 
as, on reflection, I apprehend it might stimulate him to a 
measure in which, perhaps, his mamma or brother might 
not concur, I decline it for the present. I cannot forbear, 
however, observing to you, that, in my opinion, his genius 
and his years call for a further degree of cultivation than 
can be obtained at Hurley. I wish to be useful to every 
lad of talents and cleverness ; and I assure you that desire 
will alwavs be increased, when these recommendations are 
possessed by one so nearly connected with a gentleman 
and a family who have particular claims to my esteem and 
respect. 

I am your friend, 

John Jay. 

P.S. Don't be too lazy or too busy to let me know how 
you do. 

TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Philadelphia, 16th February, 1779. 

Dear Robert, 

Your favour of the third instant came to hand this 
morning. The satisfaction my letter afforded you flatters 
as well as pleases me. It argues a remembrance of former 
times ; for which, and other reasons, I shall give you no 
more opportunities of joining the assembly of angels in 
rejoicing over penitent mortals. Not that I mean on the 
one hand to enter the state of reprobation and become a 
hardened sinner, or on the other enlist with those saints who 
slip not with their foot. 



28 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

This letter, written on the very da}' I received yours, 
will become evidence of my having gone through the 
whole process of amendment. Divines, you know, describe 
it as consisting of conviction, contrition, and conversion. 
Whether I shall persevere or not is a subject on which lime 
will utter the surest prophecies. 

The complexions of resignation, of soft complaint, and 
joyless sensibility, are so blended in your letter, that if 
anonymous, one would suppose it written by a wayworn 
traveller through this vale of tears, who, journeying towards 
his d'^tant haven through sultry and dreary paths, at length 
lays his languid limbs under some friendly shade, and per- 
mits the effusions of his soul to escape in words. My 
friend, a mind unbraced and nerves relaxed are not fit com- 
pany for each other. It was not a man whom the poet tells 
us pined in thought, and sat like patience on a monument 
smiling at grief. In such rugged times as these other sen- 
sations are to be cherished. Rural scenes, domestic bliss, 
and the charming group of pleasures found in the train of 
peace, fly at the approach <>!' war, and are seldom to be 
found in Melds stained with blood, or habitations polluted by 
outrage and desolation. 1 admire your sensibility, nor 
would I wish to see less milk in your veins ; you would be 
less amiable. In my opinion, however, your reasoning is 
not quite just. I think a man's happiness requires that he 
should condescend to keep himself free from fleas and 
wasps, as well as from thi ves and robbers. 

When the present session of your Legislature is ended, 
take a ride and see us. You will find many here happy to 
see you. I have something, though not very interesting, to 
say to you on the subject of politics, but as it is now very 
late, and I have been writing letters constantly since dinner, 
I am really too much fatigued to proceed. Make my com- 
pliments to Mrs. Livingston, who I presume is with you. 
Adieu. I am, your friend, 

John Jay.

When characters rendered amiable by virtues and im-

come subjects of investigation, the sensibility of individuals 
as well as the interest of the public are concerned in the 
event of the inquiry. 

It gives me, therefore, great pleasure to transmit to you 
an unanimous act of Congress of the 11th instant, not only 
acquitting your conduct in the transaction it relates to of 
blame, but giving it that express approbation, which patriot-

Philadelphia, 14th March, 1779. 
Dear Robert, 

Mr. Sands delivered me your favour of the 4th inst. 
yesterday. It gave me much pleasure. The length, the 
subject, and the spirit of it pleased me : unless the pain my 
last occasioned was severe, I don't regret it. That vou 
have deserved well of your country is confessed, and that 
you became latterly a little relaxed is not disputable. You 
have never been thrown out or distanced in the pursuit of 
virtue ; but, like some game horses, you sometimes want 
the whip. This is a coarse simile. Friendship will par- 
don it. 

That full confidence which induced you to think loud, 
natters me. The like returns are due, and shall be paid. 
But letters in our davs are dangerous convevances of our 
sentiments on many subjects. I seldom write without 
adverting to the consequences of miscarriage ; and hence 
the reserve and caution which mark all such of mine as are 
trusted to common carriers, or doubtful bearers. 

The state of your politics is much as I expected. I fear 
some of your measures are more severe than wisdom or 
humanity will justify. Posterity will think dispassionately, 
and probably condemn, especially when informed that they 
were hastened lest the influence of resentment should be lost. 

My silence on a certain subject arose from reflecting that 
an explanation ought not to be on paper. The probability 
of it turns on an event not yet determined. If I discern 
right, there will be room.

from colonel alexander hamilton. 

Head-quarters, March 14th, 1779. 

Dear Sir, 

Colonel Laurens, who will have the honour of delivering 
you this letter, is on his way to South Carolina, on a project 
w r hich I think, in the present situation of affairs there, is a 
very good one, and deserves every kind of support and 
encouragement. This is to raise two, three, or four bat- 
talions of negroes, with the assistance of the government of 
that State, by contributions from the owners, in proportion 
to the number they possess. If you should think proper to 
enter upon the subject with him, he will give you a detail 
of his plan. He wishes to have it recommended by Con- 
gress to the State ; and, as an inducement, that they would 
engage to take those battalions into continental pay. 

It appears to me that an expedient of this kind, in the 
present state of southern affairs, is the most rational that 
can be adopted, and promises very important advantages. 
Indeed, I hardly see how a sufficient force can be collected 
in that quarter without it ; and the enemy's operations there 
are growing infinitely serious and formidable. I have not 
the least doubt that the negroes will make very excellent 
soldiers with proper management; and I will venture to 
pronounce that they cannot be put into better hands than 
those of Mr. Laurens. He has all the zeal, intelligence, 
enterprise, and every other qualification necessity to suc- 
ceed in such an undertaking. It is a maxim with some 
great military judges, that with sensible officers, soldiers 
can hardly be too stupid ; and, on this principle, it is thought 



32 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

that the Russians would make the best troops in the world, 
if they were under other officers than their own. The King 
of Prussia is among the number who maintain this doctrine, 
and has a very emphatical saying on the occasion, which I 
do not exactly recollect. I mention this, because I hear it 
frequently objected to the scheme of imbodying negroes, 
that they nre too stupid to make soldiers. This is so far 
from appearing to me a valid objection, that I think their 
want of cultivation (for their natural faculties are probably 
as good as ours), joined to that habit of subordination, which 
they acquire from a life of servitude, will make them sooner 
become soldiers than our white inhabitants. Let oificers 
be men of sense and sentiment, and the nearer the soldiers 
approach to machines, perhaps the better. 

I foresee that this project will have to combat much 
opposition from prejudice and self-interest. The contempt 
we have been taught to entertain for the blacks, makes us 
fancy many things that are founded neither in reason nor 
experience ; and an unwillingness to part with property of 
so valuable a kind, will furnish a thousand arguments to 
show the impracticability, or pernicious tendency, of a 
scheme which requires such a sacrifice. But it should be 
considered, that if we do not make use of them in this way, 
the enemy probably will ; and that the best way to coun- 
teract the temptations they will hold out, will be to offer 
them ourselves. An essential part of the plan is to give 
them their freedom with their muskets. This will secure 
their fidelity, animate their courage, and, I believe, will 
have a good influence upon those who remain, by opening a 
door to their emancipation. This circumstance, I confess, 
has no small weight in inducing me to wish the success of 
the project ; for the dictates of humanity and true policy 
equally interest me in favour of this unfortunate class of men. 
With the truest respect and esteem, 

I am, sir your most obedient servant, 

Alex. Hamilton. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 33T 



TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Philadelphia, 21st March, 1779, 
Dear Sir, 

So uncertain has been the fate of letters during the 
course of this war, that I very seldom write one without 
adverting to the possibility and consequences of its miscar- 
riage and publication. This precaution has on a late 
occasion given me much consolation. Two of my letters 
to Mrs. Jay fell into the enemy's hands at Elizabethtown ; 
they contained nothing that would give me uneasiness if 
published. Prudential considerations of this kind have, 
since my arrival here, restrained me from writing several 
confidential letters to you ; and I should now be equally 
cautious had I not full confidence in the bearer of this, and 
under little apprehension of danger from accidents on the 
road. 

Congress has refused to accept your resignation. Twelve 
States were represented. New-England and Pennsylvania 
against you. The delegates of the latter are new men, and 
not free from the influence of the former. From New- 
York south you have fast friends. Mr. ******' s disposition 
is at least questionable. Delaware w T as unrepresented. 

What is now to be done? You best can answer this 
question. Were I in your situation, I should not hesitate a 
moment to continue in the service. I have the best authority 
to assure you that the commander-in-chief wishes you to 
retain your commission. The propriety of your resigna- 
tion is now out of question. Those laws of honour which 
might have required it arc satisfied : are you certain they 
do not demand a contrary conduct ? You have talents to 
render you conspicuous in the field ; and address to con- 
ciliate the affections of those who may now wish you ill. 
Both these circumstances are of worth to your family, and, 
independent of public considerations, argue forcibly for 
your joining the army. Gather laurels for the sake of your

country and your children — you can leave them a sufficient 
share of property — leave them also the reputation of being 
descended from an incontestably great man — a man who, 
uninfluenced by the ingratitude of his country, was unre- 
mitted in his exertions to promote her happiness. You 
have hitherto been no stranger to these sentiments, and 
therefore I forbear to enlarge. Would it not do you honour 
to inform Congress that, while in their opinion your ser- 
vices ought not to be withheld from your country, neither 
the derangement of your private affairs, the severities you 
have experienced, nor regard to your health already im- 
paired in their service, shall restrain you from devoting 
yourself to the execution of their commands ; but that 
whenever the situation of our affairs may cease to call you 
to the field, you hope they will permit you to retire and 
attend to the duties you owe your family. 

Should this be your resolution, would not the main army 
be your proper object ? there you may be best known, and 
there best acquire military influence. Consider: this cam- 
paign will in all human probability be decisive, and the 
last. Can you, therefore, employ six or eight months 
better. 

I will not apologize for the freedom with which I write, 
being persuaded that although our opinions may vary, you 
will consider this letter as some evidence of the sincerity

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Philadelphia, 6th April, 1779. 

Mr. Jay presents his compliments to General Washington, 
and encloses an extract from a letter in a certain degree 
interesting. 

Extract of a letter from Major-General Gates, of the 15th 
March, 1779, to the President of Congress. 

" The enclosed copy of my letter to General Washing- 
ton, of the 4th instant, in answer to his of the 14th ult. 
from Middlebrook, will give Congress a true idea of my 
opinion respecting our entering Canada, and the only route 
which we can take with reasonable hopes of success. Indi- 
viduals, and not the public, will be benefited by an expe- 
dition into Canada by either of the routes from Albany. 
That of Co-os alone is practicable, but not without the 
co-operation of the allied fleet. 

"General Washington's letter of the 14th of February is 
enclosed. It being the only letter I have received from his 
excellency since December, Congress will immediately 
judge of the extent or limitation which it is proper to ob- 
serve in their instructions to me." 



36 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 



FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

[Private.] 

Head-quarters, Middlebrook, 
April 14th, 1779. 

I have received your several favours of the 2d, 3d, and 
28th of March, and 6th of April. I thank you for them all, 
but especially for the last, which I consider as a distinguish- 
ing mark of your confidence and friendship. 

Conscious that it is the aim of my actions to promote the 
public good, and that no part of my conduct is influenced by 
personal enmity to individuals, I cannot be insensible to the 
artifice employed by some men to prejudice me in the 
public esteem. The circumstance of which you have 
obliged me with a communication, is among a number of 
other instances of the unfriendly views which have gov- 
erned a certain gentleman from a very early period. Some 
of these have been too notorious not to have come to your 
knowledge ; others, from the manner in which they have 
been conveyed to me, will probably never be known, ex- 
cept to a very few. But you have perhaps heard enough 
yourself to make any further explanation from me un- 
necessary. 

The desire, however, which it is natural I should feel to 
preserve the good opinion of men of sense and virtue, con- 
spiring with my wish to cultivate your friendship in parti- 
cular, induces me to trouble you with a statement of some 
facts which will serve to place the present attack in its 
proper light. In doing this I shall recapitulate and bring 
into view a series of transactions, many of which have been 
known to you ; but some of which may possibly have 
escaped your memory. 

An opinion prevailing that the enemy were likely, shortly, 
to evacuate these States, I was naturally led to turn my 
thoughts to a plan of operations against Canada, in case that 
event should take place. A winter campaign, before the 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 37 

enemy could have an opportunity of reinforcing and putting 
themselves in a more perfect state of defence, appeared to 
promise the most speedy and certain success, and the route 
by Co-os offered itself as most direct and practicable. In 
this I fully agreed with General Gates and some other gen- 
tlemen whom 1 consulted on the occasion; and on the 12th 
of September last I wrote to Congress accordingly, submit- 
ting it to them, whether it would not be advisable to be 
laying up magazines, opening a road, and making other 
preparations for the undertaking. They approved the pro- 
ject, and authorized me to carry it into execution. I the 
more readily entered into it from a consideration, that if 
circumstances should not permit us to carry on the enter- 
prise, preparations towards it could easily be converted into 
another channel, and made serviceable to our operations 
elsewhere without any material addition of expense to the 
continent, because provisions, which would compose the 
principal part of the expense, were at all events to be pur- 
chased on Connecticut River, the only doubt being whether 
they should, be used in an expedition against Canada, or 
transported to Boston — circumstances to determine this: 
with truth it may be added, that, excepting the articles of 
provision and forage, which, as before observed, would 
have been bought if no expedition by the way of Co-os 
had been in contemplation, the " incredible expense," 
mentioned by General Gates in his letter of March 4th, 
amounted to the purchase of a few pair of men's shoes, 
and some leather for moccasins only. If any other expense 
has been incurred, it is unknown to me — must have been 
by his order, and he alone answerable for it. 

In October following, Congress entered into arrange- 
ments with the Marquis de la Fayette for co-operating with 
the court of France, in an expedition against that country. 
In this scheme, one body of troops was to proceed from 
Co-os and penetrate by way of the river St. Francis ; others 
forming a junction at Niagara, were to enter Canada by 



38 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

that route ; and while these were operating in this manner, 
a French fleet and a body of French troops were to go up 
the river St. Lawrence, and take possession of Quebec. 

You are well acquainted with the opposition I gave to 
this plan, and my reasons at large for it. From what has 
since happened, they seem to have met the full approbation 
of Congress. The ideas I held up were principally these : 
that we ought not to enter into any contract with a foreign 
power, unless we were sure we should be able to fulfil our 
engagements — that it was uncertain whether the enemy 
would quit the States or not ; and in case they did not, it 
would be impracticable to furnish the aids which we had 
stipulated — that even if they should leave us, it was doubt- 
ful whether our own resources would be equal to the sup- 
plies required ; that therefore it would be impolitic to 
hazard a contract of the kind, and better to remain at 
liberty to act as future conjunctures should point out. I 
recommended, nevertheless, as there were powerful reasons 
to hope the enemy might go away, that eventual prepara- 
tions should be made to take advantage of it, to possess 
ourselves of Niagara and other posts in that quarter, for the 
security of our frontiers, and to carry our views still 
further with respect to a conquest of Canada, if we should 
find ourselves able to prosecute such an enterprise. 

This, Congress in a subsequent resolve, approved, and 
directed to be done. It was not the least motive with me 
for recommending it, that operations of this nature seemed 
to be a very favourable object with this honourable body. 
The preparations on Hudson River were undertaken in 
consequence. 

Upon a nearer view of our finances and resources, and 
when it came to be decided that the enemy would continue 
for some time longer to hold the posts they were in posses- 
sion of, in the course of the conferences with which I was 
honoured by the committee of Congress in Philadelphia, I 
suggested my doubts of the propriety of continuing our 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. .'{9 

northern preparations upon so extensive a plan as was first 
determined. The committee were of opinion with me, that 
the state of our currency and supplies in general would 
oblige us to act on the defensive next campaign, except so 
far as related to an expedition into the Indian country for 
chastising the savages, and preventing their depredations 
on our back settlements ; and that though it would be ex- 
tremely desirable to be prepared for pushing our operations 
further, yet our necessities exacting a system of economy 
forbade our launching into much extra expense for objects 
which were remote and contingent. This determination 
having taken place, all the northern preparations were dis- 
continued, except such as were necessary towards the 
intended Indian expedition. 

Things were in this situation when I received a letter 
from General Bailey (living at Co-os), expressing some fears 
for the safety of the magazine at Co-os ; in consequence of 
which I directed the stores to be removed lower down the 
country. This I did to prevent a possibility of accident, 
though I did not apprehend they were in much danger. 
Sometime afterward I received the letter (No. 1) from 
General Gates, expressing similar fears, to which I returned 
him the answer of 14th February, transmitted by him to 
Congress, (No. 2.) Knowing that preparations had been 
making at Albany, and unacquainted with their true design, 
he inferred, from a vague expression in that letter, that the 
intention of attacking Canada was still adhered to, but that I 
had changed the plan, and was going by way of Lake Cham- 
plain or Ontario : either of these routes he pronounces im- 
practicable, and represents that by Co-os as the only prac- 
ticable one. He goes further, and declares, that " in the 
present state of our army, and the actual situation of our 
magazines, to attempt a serious invasion of Canada by 
whatever route, would prove unsuccessful, unless the fleet 
of our allies should at the same time co-operate with us, by 
sailing up the river St. Lawrenre." Though I differ with 



40 LIFE OF JOHN JAY- 

him as to the impracticability of both the other routes, I 
venture to go a step beyond him respecting our ability to 
invade Canada ; and am convinced, that in our present 
circumstances, and with the enemy in front, we cannot 
undertake a serious invasion of that country at all, even 
with the aid of an allied Jleet. 

You will perceive, sir, that I have uniformly made the 
departure of the enemy from these States an essential con- 
dition to the invasion of Canada, and that General Gates 
has entirely mistaken my intentions. Hoping that I had 
embarked in a scheme which our situation would not justify, 
he eagerly seizes the opportunity of exposing my supposed 
errors to Congress ; and in the excess of his intemperate 
zeal to injure me, exhibits himself in a point of view from 
which I imagine he will derive little credit. The decency 
of the terms in which he undertakes to arraign my conduct, 
both to myself and to Congress, and the propriety of the 
hasty appeal he has made, will, I believe, appear at least 
questionable to every man of sense and delicacy. 

The last paragraph of the extract with which you favour 
me, is a pretty remarkable one. 1 shall make no comments 
further than as it implies a charge of neglect on my part, in 
not writing to him but once since December. From the 
beginning of last campaign to the middle of December, about 
seven months, I have copies of near fifty letters to him, and 
about forty originals from him. 1 think it will be acknow- 
ledged the correspondence was frequent enough during that 
period ; and if it has not continued in the same proportion 
since, the only >reason was, that the season of the year, the 
troops being in winter-quarters, and General Gates's situ- 
ation unfruitful of events, and unproductive of any military 
arrangements between us, afforded very little matter for 
epistolary intercourse ; and I flatter myself it will be readily 
believed, that I am sufficiently occupied with the necessary 
business of my station, and have no need of increasing it 
by multiplying letters without an object. If you were to 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 41 

peruse, my dear sir, the letters that have passed between 
General Gates and myself for a lone time back, you would 
be sensible that I have no great temptation to court his 
correspondence, when the transacting of business does not 
require it. An air of design — a want of candour in many 
instances, and even of politeness, give no very inviting 
complexion to the correspondence on his part. As a speci- 
men of this, I send you a few letters and extracts, which at 
your leisure, I shall be glad you will cast your eye upon. 

Last fall it w r as for some time strongly suspected that the 
enemy would transport the whole, or the greater part, of 
their force eastward, and combine one great land and sea 
operation against the French fleet in Boston harbour : on 
this supposition, as I should go in person to Boston, the 
command next in importance was the posts on the North 
River. This properly would devolve on General Gates ; 
but from motives of peculiar scrupulousness, as there had 
been a difference between us, I thought it best to know 
whether it was agreeable to him, before I directed his con- 
tinuance. By way of compliment, I wrote him a letter 
containing the extract No. 3, expecting a cordial answer 
and cheerful acceptance. I received the evasive and un- 
satisfactory reply, No. 4. A few days after this, upon 
another occasion, I wrote him the letter No. 5, to which I 
received the extraordinary answer No. 6, w r hich was passed 
over in silence. 

The plan of operations for the campaign being deter- 
mined, a commanding officer was to be appointed for the 
Indian expedition. This command, according to all present 
appearance, will probably be of the second, if not of the first 
importance for the campaign. The officer conducting it 
has a flattering prospect of acquiring more credit than can 
be expected by any other this year, and he has the best 
reason to hope for success. General Lee, from his situation, 
was out of the question. General Schuyler, who, by the 
way, would have been most agreeable to me, was so un- 

VOL. II. F 



42 T.IFE OF JOHN JAY. 

certain of continuing in the army, that I could not appoint 
him. General Putnam I need not mention. I therefore 
made the offer of it (for the appointment could no longer be 
delayed) to General Gates, who was next in seniority, 
though perhaps I might have avoided it, if I had been so 
disposed, from his being in a command by the special ap- 
pointment of Congress. My letter to him on the occasion 
you will find in No. 7. I believe you will think it was 
conceived in very candid and polite terms, and merited a 
rent answer from the one given it in No. 8. 

I discovered, very early in the war, symptoms of coldness 
and constraint in General Gates's behaviour to me. These 
increased as lie rose into greater consequence; but we did 
not come to a direct breach till the beginning of last year- 
Tins was occasioned by a correspondence, which I thought 
made rather free with me, between him and General Con- 
way, which accidentally came to my knowledge. The 
particulars of this affair you will find delineated in the 
packet herewith, endorsed " Papers respecting General 
Conway." Besides the evidence contained in them of the 
genuineness of the offensive correspondence, I have other 
proofs, still more convincing, which, having been given me 
in a confidential way, I am not at liberty to impart. 

After this affair subsided, I made it a point of treating 
General Gates with all the attention and cordiality in my 
power, as well from a sincere desire of harmony, as from 
an unwillingness to give any cause of triumph to our ene- 
mies from an appearance of dissension among ourselves. 
I can appeal to the world and to the whole army, whether 
I have not cautiously avoided every word or hint that could 
tend to dis] ■ General Gates in any way. I am sorry 

his conduct to me has not been equally generous, and that 
he is continually giving me fresh proof's of malevolence and 
> i . It. will not be doing him injustice to say, that 
besides the little underhand intrigues which he is frequently 
practising, there has hardly been any great military question 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 43 

in which his advice has been asked, that it has not been 
given in an equivocal and designing manner, apparently 
calculated to afford him an opportunity of censuring me, on 
the failure of whatever measures might be adopted. 

When I find that this gentleman does not scruple to take 
the most unfair advantages of me, I am under a necessity 
of explaining his conduct to justify my own. This, and the 
perfect confidence I have in you, have occasioned me to 
trouble you with so free a communication of the state of 
things between us. I shall still be as passive as a regard 
to my own character will permit. 1 am, however, uneasy, as 
General Gates has endeavoured to impress Congress with 
an unfavourable idea of me, and as I onlv r know this in a 
private confidential way, that I cannot take any step to 
remove the impression if it should be made. I am aware, 
sir, of the delicacy of your situation, and I mean this letter 
only for your own private information ; you will therefore 
not allow yourself to be embarrassed by its contents, but 
with respect to me, pass it over in silence. 

With the truest esteem and personal regard, 
I am, dear sir, 
Your obliged and obedient servant, 
Geo. Washington.

Philadelphia, 21st April, 1779. 
Dear Sir, 
Accept my thanks for the long and friendly letter of the 
14th inst. which I have had the pleasure of receiving from 
you. It was, for many reasons, grateful to me. I value 
the esteem and regard of the wise and virtuous ; and bad 
wished to know the particulars of transactions respecting 
which only vague and unsatisfactory reports had come to 
my knowledge. Delicacy forbade my breaking the subject 
to you when here. I was sure of your politeness, but not 
certain of more than a usual degree of confidence. The 



44 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

latter has now become manifest, and permit me to assure 
you it shall be mutual. The impression attempted to be 
made has not taken. It passed without a single remark. 
Your friends thought it merited nothing but silence and 
neglect. The same reason induced me to take no notice 
of it in my answer. 

I have perused the several papers with which you 
favoured me. The delicacy, candour, and temper diffused 
through your letters form a strong contrast to the evasions 
and design observable in some others. Gratitude ought to 
have attached a certain gentleman to the friend who raised 
him ; a spurious ambition, however, has, it seems, made 
him your enemy. This is not uncommon. To the dis- 
honour of human nature, the history of mankind has many 
pages filled with similar instances ; and we have little rea- 
son to expect that the annals of the present or future times 
will present us with fewer characters of this class. On the 
contrary, there is reason to expect that they will multiply in 
the course of this revolution. Seasons of general heat, 
tumult, and fermentation favour the production and growth 
of some great virtues, and of many great and little vices. 
Which will predominate, is a question which events not 
yet produced nor now to be discerned can alone determine. 
What parties and factions will arise, to what objects be 
directed, what sacrifices they will require, and who will be 
the victims, are matters beyond the sphere of human pre- 
science. New modes of government, not generally under- 
stood, nor in certain instances approved — want of modera- 
tion and information in the people — want of abilities and 
rectitude in some of their rulers — a wide field open for the 
operations of ambition — men raised from low degrees to 
high stations, and rendered giddy by elevation and the 
extent of their views — a revolution in private property 
and in national attachments — laws dictated by the spirit of 
the times, not the spirit of justice and liberal policy — lati- 
tude in principles as well as commerce — suspension of edu- 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 45 

cation — fluctuations in manners, and public counsels, and 
moral obligations — indifference to religion, &c. &c, are 
circumstances that portend evils which much prudence, 
vigour, and circumspection are necessary to prevent or 
control. To me, there appears reason to expect a long 
storm and difficult navigation. Calm repose and the sweets 
of undisturbed retirement appear more distant than a peace 
with Britain. It gives me pleasure, however, to reflect that 
the period is approaching when we shall become citizens of 
a better-ordered state ; and the spending a few troublesome 
years of our eternity in doing good to this and future gene- 
rations is not to be avoided nor regretted. Things will 
come right, and these States will be great and flourishing. 
The dissolution of our government threw us into a political 
chaos. Time, wisdom, and perseverance will reduce it 
into form, and give it strength, order, and harmony. In 
this work you are, to speak in the style of one of your pro- 
fessions, a master-builder ; and God grant that you may 
long continue a free and accepted mason. 

Thus, my dear sir, I have indulged myself in thinking loud 
in your hearing ; it would be an Hibernicism to say in your 
sight, though in one sense true ; it is more than probable I 
shall frequently do the like. Your letter shall be my 
apology, and the pleasure resulting from the converse of 
those we esteem, the motive. 

I am, dear sir, 
With perfect esteem and regard, 

Your most obedient servant, 

John Jay. 

from general washington. 

Middlebrook, April, 1779. 
Dear Sir, 
In one of your former letters you intimate, that a free 
communication of sentiments will not be displeasing to you. 
If, under this sanction, I should step beyond the line you 



46 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

would wish to draw, and sug -i ideas or ask questions 
which arc improper to be answered, you hare only to pass 
them by in silence. I wish vou to be convinced that I do 
not desire to pry into measures the knowledge of which is 
not necessary for my government as an executive officer, 
or the premature discovery of which might be prejudicial 
to plans in contemplation. 

After premising this. 1 beg leave to ask what are the 
reasons for keeping the continental frigates in port? If it 
is because hands cannot be obtained to man them on 
the present encouragement, some other plan ought to be 
adopted to make them useful. Had not Congress better 
lend them to commanders of known bravery and capacity 
for a limited term, at the expiration of which the vessels, if 
not taken or lost, to revert to the States— they and their 
crews, in the mean time, enjoying the exclusive benefit of 
all captures they make, but acting either .singly or con- 
jointly under the direction of Congress ? If this or a similar 
plan could be fallen upon, comprehending the whole num- 
ber, under some common head, a man of ability and 
authority commissioned to act as commodore or admiral, 
I think great advantages might result from it. I am not 
sure but at this moment, by such a collection of the naval 
force we have, all the British armed vessels and transports 
at Georgia might be taken or destroyed, and their troops 
ruined. Upon the present system, our ships are not only 
very expensive and totally useless in port, but sometimes 
require a land force to protect them, as happened lately at 
New-London. 

The rumour of the camp is, that Monsieur Gerard is about 
to return to France ; some speak confidently of its taking 
place. If this be a fact, the motives doubtless an > powerful ; 
as it would open a wide field for speculation, and give our 
enemies, whether with or without real cause, at least a 
handle for misrepresentation and triumph. 

Will Congress suffer the Bermudian vessels, which are 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 17 

i to have arrived atDelaware and Chesapeake Bays, to 
exchang ■ their salt for Hour, as is reported to be their inten- 
tion ? Will they not .rather order them to depart imme- 
diately? Indulging them with a supply of provisions at 
this time will be injurious to us in two respects: it will 
deprive us of what we really stand in nc^d of for ourselves, 
and will contribute to the supporl of that swarm of priva- 
teers which resort to Bermuda, from whence they infest our 
• •oast, and, in a manner, annihilate our trade. Besides these 
considerations, by withholding a supply, we throw many 
additional months upon the enemy's magazines, and inerease 
proportionally their distress. r i ney will not and cannot 
let their people starve. 

In the last place, though first in importance, I shall ask, 
is there any thing doing, or that can be done, to restore the 
credit of our currency '. The depreciation of it is got to so 
alarming a point that a wagon-load of money will scarcely 
purchase a wagon-load of provisions. 

I repeat what I before 'ved, that I do not wish for 

your reply to more of these matters than you can touch 
with strict propriety. 

Very truly I am, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and affectionate servant, 

Geouge Washington.

Philadelphia, 26th April, 1779. 

Dear Sir, 

The questions contained in your favour of the — : — April 
instant are as imj he .manner of introducing them 

is delicate. 

While the maritime affairs of the continent continue 
under the direction of they will be exposed to 

all the con qu ;nc s of want of system, ittenl on, and

coming in, and old ones going out ; three or four, indeed, 
have remained in it from the beginning ; and few members 
understand even the state of our naval affairs, or have 
time or inclination to attend to them. But why is not this 
system changed 1 It is, in my opinion, inconvenient to the 
family compact. The commercial committee was equally 
useless. A proposition was made to appoint a commercial 
agent for the States under certain regulations. Opposition 
was made. The ostensible objections were various. The 
true reason was its interfering with a certain commercial 
agent in Europe and his connexions. 

You will, if I am not greatly mistaken, find Mr. Gerard dis- 
posed to be open and communicative. He has acquired an 
extensive knowledge of our affairs ; I have no reason to 
believe he will use it to our prejudice. There is as much 
intrigue in this State-house as in the Vatican, but as little 
secrecy as in a boarding-school. It mortifies me on this oc- 
casion to reflect that the rules of Congress on the subject of 
secrecy, which are far too general, and perhaps for that 
reason more frequently violated, restrains me from saying 
twenty things to you which have ceased to be private. 

The state of our currency is really serious. When or 
by what means the progress of the depreciation will be 
prevented, is uncertain. The subject is delicate, but the 
conduct of some men really indicates at least great indiffer- 
ence about it. It will not be many days before measures 
having a great, though not immediate influence on this sub- 
ject, will be either adopted or rejected. I shall then have 
an opportunity of being more particular. 
I am, my dear sir, 

With perfect esteem and regard, 

Your obedient servant, 

John Jay.

FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Head-quarters, Middlebrook, ^ 
May 10th, 1779. £ 

I seize a moment of leisure to thank you, my dear sir, 
for your obliging favours of the 21st and 2Gth of April. 
My friendship for you will always make me take pleasure 
in cultivating the esteem and confidence of which you so 
politely assure me. 

You give an affecting summary of the causes of the 
national evils we feel, and the still greater we have reason 
to apprehend. To me it appears that our affairs are in a 
very delicate situation ; and what is not the least to be 
lamented is, that many people think they are in a very 
flourishing way ; and seem in a great measure insensible to 
the danger with which we are threatened. If Britain should 
be able to make a vigorous campaign in America this 
summer, in the present depreciation of our money, scanti- 
ness of supplies, want of virtue and want of exertion, 'tis 
hard to say what may be the consequence. 

It is a melancholy consideration that any concerned in 
the conduct of public affairs should discover an indifference 
to the state of our currency. Nothing, in my opinion, can 
be more manifest, than that if something effectual be not 
done to restore its credit, it will in a short time either cease 
to circulate altogether, or circulate so feebly as to be utterly 
incapable of drawing out the resources of the country. 
This is nearly the case now. 

With every sentiment of esteem and regard, 

I am, dear sir, 
Your most obedient servant, 

George Washington.

50 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 



TO HIS EXCELLENCY SAMUEL HUNTINGDON, 

President of Congress. 

Philadelphia, 4th Oct., 1779. 

Sir. 

It gives me very sensible pleasure to find, from the act 
of Congress enclosed in your excellency's polite favour of 
the 1st inst., that my conduct in the chair and in the execu- 
tion of public business has been honoured by the approba- 
tion of Congress. The testimony given of it by this act, 
demands my warmest acknowledgments. Be pleased, sir, 
to assure the Congress, that my happiness is inseparable 
from the welfare and esteem of my country, and that my 
endeavours to promote the one and merit the other, shall 
continue unremitted. 

I have the honour to be, 

With great respect and esteem, 
Your excellency's most obedient servant, 

John Jay. 

from r. r. livingston. 

Kingston, 6th October, 1779. 
Dear John, 
I have just now heard that you are upon the point of 
leaving us. I might have expected to have received this 
intelligence from yourself, rather than from loose report, 
since there is scarce a transaction in the world in which I 
feel myself more interested. I rejoice at it as it advances 
your fortune and reputation. I lament it, as it adds to the 
losses I have already felt in the course of this war, that of 
a friend whom I had sense enough to value, even before 
age had ripened my judgment, and whom an after acquaint- 
ance with the world has taught me to think inestimable. I 
call it a loss, for I have but little prospect of seeing you 
here again. You will now move in a more enlarged 
sphere, and will hardly think of recrossing the Atlantic, till

the blood runs too slowly in our veins to keep up the 
ardour of friendship. I was going- to give you a long 
detail of State politics, but they are now unworthy your 
attention. Besides that, I by no means feel myself disposed 
at this moment to view them in any other than the most con- 
temptible light, or to execrate them for detaining me here, 
when I so ardently wish to receive your last adieu. When 
do you embark, and where 1 If from Boston, tell me when 
to meet you at Fishkill, and perhaps (if the Legislature ad- 
journ) to accompany you. If this pleasure is denied me, 
believe that you and yours are attended by every tender 
wish which the sincerest friendship can dictate. I will not 
wrong you so much as to ask you to omit no occasion of 
lessening the pain I feel in your absence, by writing to me 
by every conveyance ; your own heart has and will for 
ever suggest that thought. Adieu, my dear John ; 

May you be as happy as I wish you, 

Robert 11. Livingston.

West-Point, October 7th, 1779. 

Dear Sir, 

Among the number of your friends, permit me also to 
congratulate you, and my country, on your late honourable 
and important appointment. Be assured, sir, that my 
pleasure on this occasion, though it may be equalled, cannot 
be exceeded by that of any other. 

I do most sincerely wish you a pleasant and agreeable 
passage, the most perfect and honourable accomplishment 
of your ministry, and a safe return to the bosom of a grate- 
ful country. 

With the greatest regard, and sincerest personal attach- 
ment, I have the honour to be, 

Your most obedient and 

Affectionate humble servant, 

George Washington.

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Philadelphia, 14th October, 1779. 

My Dear Sir, 
Your very kind letter of the 7th inst., gave me all that 
pleasure which accompanies marks of cordial esteem and 
attachment from those whose commendation is praise, and 
whose friendship is discriminate. 

Among the objects of my mission are some which, how- 
ever just, will not be easily attained, and therefore its 
success w T ill be precarious, and probably partial. The only 
satisfaction I promise myself from this appointment, will 
flow from the rectitude with which the duties of it will be 
discharged, and not from a prospect of general approbation. 
God grant that the time may not be far distant when 
peace and liberty shall lead you from the field, to enjoy, in 
silence and retirement, the luxury of reflecting that you had 
saved your country. 

Adieu, my dear sir, 

With sincere affection and esteem, 

I am your friend and servant, 

John Jay. 

from edmund pendleton. 

Edmunsbury, October 11th, 1779. 
Dear Sir, 
I congratulate you, sir, upon your appointment to repre- 
sent the American States at the court of Madrid ; the just 
testimony of that confidence which the honourable body 
you have presided over, have in your abilities and integrity. 
May health, success, and every felicity accompany you; 
but, while I am sensible of the advantages we shall reap 
from your eminent services there, I have my fears that they 
will be missed, importantly, where you now are ; and that 
the spirit of party, almost laid to sleep, will revive upon 
your absence. 1 cordially wish you may be able to heal 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 53 

the new-made breach between Spain and Britain, since 
France appears disposed to peace, and I am mistaken if the 
court of London are not ready to make up with us, if 
nothing respecting our allies hinders it. Indeed we want 
an honourable peace ; but 1 hope there lives not a wretch 
who wishes it upon terms of dishonour to our noble allies. 
I am, sir, with unfeigned regard, 

Your most obliged and obedient servant,

from benjamin franklin. 

Passy, June 13th, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 

Yesterday, and not before, is come to hand your favour 
of April 14th, with the packets and despatches from Con- 
gress, &c, which you sent me by a French gentleman to 
Nantes. 

Several of them appear to have been opened, the paper 
round the seals being smoked and burnt, as with the flame 
of a candle used to soften the wax, and the impression 
defaced. The curiosity of people in this time of war is 
unbounded. Some of them only want to see news, but 
others want to find (through interested views) what chance 
there is of a speedy peace. Mr. Ross has undertaken to 
forward the letters to England. I have not seen them ; but 
he tells me they have all been opened. I am glad, however, 
to receive the despatches from Congress, as they communi- 
cate to me Mr. Adams's instructions, and other particulars 
of which I have been long ignorant. 

I am very sensible of the weight of your observation, 
" that a constant interchange of intelligence and attentions 
between the public servants at the different courts, are 
necessary to procure to their constituents all the advantages 
capable of being derived from their appointment." I shall 
endeavour to perform my part with you, as well to have 
the pleasure of your correspondence, as from a sense of 



54 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

duty. But my time is more taken up with matters extra- 
neous to the functions of a minister, than you can possibly 
imagine. I have written often to the Congress to establish 



r- 



consuls in the ports, and ease me of what relates to mari- 
time and mercantile affairs ; but no notice has yet been 
taken of my request. 

A number of bills of exchange, said to be drawn by 
order of Congress on Mr. Laurens, are arrived in Holland. 
A merchant there has desired to know of me, whether, if 
he accepts them, I will engage to reimburse him. I have 
no orders or advice about them from Congress ; do you 
know to what amount they have drawn ? I doubt I cannot 
safely meddle with them. 

Mrs. Jay does me much honour in desiring to have one 
of the prints that have been made here of her countryman. 
I send what is said to be the best of five or six engraved 
by different hands, from different paintings. The verses at 
the bottom are truly extravagant. But you must know 
that the desire of pleasing by a perpetual rise of compli- 
ments in this polite nation, has so used up all the common 
expressions of approbation, that they are become flat and 
insipid, and to use them almost implies censure. Hence 
music, that formerly might be sufficiently praised when it 
was called bonne, to go a little farther they called it excel- 
Icntc, then superbe, magnifique, ezquise, celeste, all which, 
being in their turns worn out, there only remains divine ; 
and when that is grown as insignificant as its predecessors, 
I think they must return to common speech and common 
sense ; as from vying with one another in fine and costly 
paintings on their coaches, since I first knew the country, 
not being able to go farther in that way, they have returned 
lately to plain carriages, painted without arms or figures, in 
one uniform colour. 

The league of neutral nations to protect their commerce 
is now established. Holland, offended by fresh insults from 
England, is arming vigorously. That nation has madly

brought itself into the greatest distress, and has not a friend 
in the world. 

With great and sincere esteem, 
I am, dear sir. 
Your most obedient and most humble servant, 

Benjamin Franklin. 

TO EGBERT BENsoN.' 

Aranjuez, June, 1780. ] 
Dear Benson, 

When shall we again, by a cheerful fire, or under a shady- 
tree, recapitulate our juvenile pursuits or pleasures, or look 
back on the extensive field of politics we once have trodden ? 
Our plans of life have, within these few years past, been 
strangely changed. Our country, I hope, will be the better 
for the alterations. How far we, individually, may be bene- 
fited, is more questionable. Personal considerations, how- 
ever, must give way to public ones, and the consciousness 
of having done our duty to our country and posterity, must 
recompense us for all the evils we experience in their cause. 

I wrote to you from Martinico. I have been four months 
in this kingdom without receiving more than three letters 
from America, and those not very interesting, being of old 
dates and not particular. You are among those from whom 
I wish often to hear, as well because I am interested in 
what concerns yourself, as on account of the intelligence 
respecting the affairs of our State, which I hope you will 
sometimes favour me with. Write nothing, nevertheless, 
that you would wish to be entirely private ; your letters 
may be inspected before they reach me ; that practice being 
general in the post-offices of France and Spain. 

I flatter myself you sometimes visit your Fishkill friends. 
I know they esteem you, and always derive pleasure from 
your company. What arrangements have born made in

July 11th, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 

By a letter from Messrs. Gardoqui and Sons, of May 3d, 
received yesterday, I have the pleasure of knowing you 
were then well. In a postcript to one of his former of Feb- 
ruary 24th, the P. S. not dated, he says he hears of you 
every week. This creates a chagrin, as we have none of 
vour favours later than March 3d. You are not to suppose 
that I dare to complain ; I have read my Bible to better 
purpose. I am not entitled to throw the " first stones," but I 
have as good a title as anybody to palliate my own faults, and 
to shift them upon others. There is said to be a commiitee 
of foreign affairs. Each member is loaded with a varietv 
of business ; two have amiable wives near Philadelphia ; I 
miss the gentlemen, therefore, frequently. Mr. Livingston 
is now absent, but you have, herewith, a letter he sent to 
my care a few days ago. The weather is murderous hot, 
and I cannot go up and down to the offices, in search of 
those authenticated papers, which ought to be regularly for- 
warded to you, and other dignified officers abroad. You 
will be pleased therefore to know from me, individually, 
and by way of a resolve of Congress of June 21st, certified 
by me, that Mr. Dohrman, of Lisbon, is appointed our agent 

in Portugal.

Mr. Searle is the bearer of this, via France, and Mr. 
Laurens will either go for Holland in the same ship, the 
Jay, or will sail in a few days by another opportunity for 
Holland. The former gentleman is on business for the 
State of Pennsylvania, and, perhaps, for some mercantile 
companies also. You already know Mr. Laurens is to 
negotiate a loan. Indeed, an instruction was given to a 
committee to bring in a draught of a letter to the ministers 
plenipotentiary of these States at Versailles and Madrid, 
directing them to inform his most Christian and Catholic 
Majesty of the appointment of Mr. Laurens, and to solicit 
the aid of their majesties, respectively, on this occasion.

to james lovell. 

Madrid, 27th October, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 

Your letter of the 11th July gave me much pleasure ; 
there is a degree of ease and cordiality in it, which, as a 
mere letter of business, it did not require. I am the more 
obliged to you for it. 

It is true that I might write to Congress very often, indeed 
by every vessel, and there arc many of them ; but how are 
my letters to get to the seaside ? By the post ? They 
would be all inspected, and many suppressed. There is 
scarce a man in any of the ports, except Mr. Harrison, at 
Cadiz, with whom I would trust them ; so that if under 
different covers I could get them there, the danger would 
not end. To write often, and write nothing material, would 
be useless ; and when you see my public letter by this op- 
portunity, you will perceive that to be well understood I 
must write a great deal. I would throw stones, too. with 
all my heart, if I thought they would hit only the committee 
without injuring the members of it. Till now I have 

VOL. II. H 



58 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

received but one letter from them, and that not worth s 
farthing, though it conveyed a draft for one hundred thou- 
sand pounds sterling on the bank of hope. One good 
private correspondent would be worth twenty standing 
committees, made of the wisest heads in America, for the 
purpose of intelligence. What with clever wives, or 
pleasant walks, or too tired, or too busy, or do you do it, 
very little is done, much postponed, and more neglected. 

If you, who are naturally industrious and love your 
country, would frequently take up your pen and your 
ciphers, and tell me how the wheel of politics runs, and 
what measures it is from time to time turning out, I should 
be better informed, and Congress better served. I now 
get more intelligence of your affairs from the French 
ambassador, than from all the members of Congress put 
together. 

I had written thus far when I received a letter from Mr. 
Le Couteux, at Cadiz, enclosing a letter of the lGth of 
September, written at St. Ildefonso from me to Congress. 
It had been enclosed in one to Mr. Harrison, and that again 
put under cover to Mr. Le Couteux, and under these two 
covers was put into the post-office. Now mark its fate. 
The director of the post-office at Cadiz showed it to Mr. 
Le Couteux, naked and stripped of its two covers, of which 
he made no mention. He said it came from Bayonne, but 
Le Couteux, knowing my handwriting, paid the postage 
and returned it to me. 

This is only one among the many instances of the fate 
to which my letters are subjected. To avoid it I must now 
be at the expense of sending Colonel Livingston to the sea- 
side with my despatches. 

I am, dear sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

John Jay,

FROM ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Philadelphia, 26th August, 1780. 
Dear John, 

I received yours of the 23d May from Madrid, with 
duplicates thereof, and the letters you wrote from Cadiz 
and Martinique. 

Your remembrance of the pleasurable days of our 
youth, and the scenes in which we mutually bore our parts, 
together with the attractions which this country still has for 
you, afford me the most pleasing hope that neither time nor 
absence will weaken a friendship which has so long stood 
the test of both. This indeed I expected from the steadi- 
ness of your temper ; but I must confess that I had little 
hopes that your early return would afford me a prospect of 
deriving that consolation from it in the decline of life, to 
which I looked even while it directed the pursuits and ani- 
mated the pleasures of youth. 

You mistake your own heart when you say you are un- 
ambitious : and without the assurance contained in your 
letter, I should have believed that the love of glory would 
have always kept you in the line in which you now are, 
more especially as the general satisfaction that your appoint- 
ment and conduct since has given, renders it the wish of 
everybody less interested in your return than I am, to keep 
you abroad. 

I have not been able to procure at this place the key to 
the cipher that you directed me to, though I believe I have it 
at home ; besides that, it is very intricate and troublesome ; 
I shall therefore be obliged to confine what I have to say 
to mere common occurrences. I enclose you a cipher 
which is very simple, and not to be deciphered while the 
key is concealed, as the same figure represents a variety of 
letters. In order that you may know whether it comes 
safely to hand, I have in this letter used the precaution 
mentioned in yours. 



60 IilFE OF JOHN JAY. 

Nothing astonishes me more than the confidence with 
which the British ministry and their dependants assert, that 
America sighs to return to their government, since the fact 
is that we never were more determined in opposition, nor, 
if we except the derangement of our finances (which the 
loan of half a million would re-establish, if remitted in 
specie or merchandise), were we ever so capable of resist- 
ance. Our crops are uncommonly fine, and the militia of 
every State north and east of Delaware, is armed, disci- 
plined, and inured to the duties of a camp. The southern 
militia are now at school, and I have no doubt will improve 
by the lessons they receive from the enemy. Our friend 
Smith, who has probably contributed to this ministerial 
madness, uninstructed by his repeated disappointments from 
the beginning of the war, is said to have advised Knip- 
hausen to erect the royal standard in the Jerseys before 
General Clinton returned from Charleston, persuaded that 
our troops, and particularly the militia, would flock to it, 
and thus he have the honour of reducing the country, with- 
out sharing it with Clinton. He accordingly came over 
with great parade, with his whole force, scattering exagge- 
rated accounts in printed handbills of the loss of Charleston, 
which, instead of discouraging, only animated the militia. 
They were all in motion upon the first alarm, and though 
opposed only by them and less than a thousand continental 
troops, he was disgracefully driven out with the loss of 500 
men killed, wounded, and taken, after having penetrated 
ten miles from the shore, and done us no other injury than 
the burning of a few houses, and the abuse and murder of 
some women ; since which they have been more cautious 
and less sanguine. Adieu ; remember my compliments to 
the colonel and Mr. Carmichael. I am, dear John, 

Most sincerely yours, 

Robert R. Livingston.

St. Ildefonso, 17th Sept., 1780. 
Sin, 

Accept my thanks for your favour of the 21st April, 
which was delivered to me the 27th August. Knowledge 
is essential to the duration of liberty, and Pennsylvania is 
wise in making them both the objects of public care. I 
have read your oration with pleasure. The subject is a 
fine one, the field large, and you have interspersed it with 
useful remarks and entertaining reflections. I put it into 
the hands of the Count D'Estaing and the French ambas- 
sador. Thev both said civil things of it. 

The society* have done me much honour by placing me 
on the list of their members. I shall endeavour to evince 
the sense I have of it, bv now and then sending them what- 
ever I may find here worth their attention. 

I congratulate you on the glorious spirit spreading from 
your city through America. Your bank is the subject of 
much conversation and encomium, and the patriotism of 
the ladies renders them very celebrated. Such marks of 
union and public spirit are worth a victory. To be re- 
spectable abroad, we must be respectable at home, and the 
best way to gain friends is to be formidable to our enemies. 
But you know these things as well as I do, and I am per- 
suaded your endeavours will not be wanting to place our 
country in both these points of light. Dr. Foulke may 
rely on my omitting no opportunity of being useful to him ; 
we must take care of young Americans. Much depends 
on the rising generation, and no pains should be spared to 
render them equal to the task that devolves upon them. 

Be assured that it will give me pleasure to continue this 
correspondence, and that I am, sir, 

Your most obedient and humble servant, 

John Jay.

62 LIFE OP JOHN JAY. 



FROM BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. 

Passy, October 2d, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 

I received duly and in good order the several letters 
you have written to me of August 16th, 19th, September 
8th, and 22d. The papers that accompanied them of your 
writing gave me the pleasure of seeing the affairs of our 
country in such good hands, and the prospect, from your 
youth, of its having the service of so able a minister for a 
creat number of years. But the little success that has 
attended your late applications for money mortified me 
exceedingly ; and the storm of bills which I found coming 
upon us both, has terrified and vexed me to such a degree 
that I have been deprived of sleep, and so much indisposed 
by continual anxiety, as to be rendered almost incapable of 
writing. 



b 



At length I got over a reluctance that was almost in- 
vincible, and made another application to the government 
here for more money. I drew up and presented a state of 
debts and newly-expected demands, and requested its aid 
to extricate me. Judging from your letters that you were 
not likely to obtain any thing considerable from your court, 
I put down in my estimate the 25,000 dollars drawn upon 
you, with the same sum drawn upon me, as what would 
probably come to me for payment. I have now the pleas- 
ure to acquaint you that my memorial was received in the 
kindest and most friendly manner, and though the court 
here is not without its embarrassments on account of 
money, I was told to make myself easy, for that I should 
be assisted with what was necessary. Mr. Searle arriving 
about this time, and assuring me there had been a plentiful 
harvest, and great crops of all kinds ; that the Congress 
had demanded of the several States contributions in pro- 
duce, which would be cheerfully given ; that they would 
therefore have plenty of provisions to dispose of; and I 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. G3 

being much pleased with the generous behaviour just ex- 
perienced, I presented another paper, proposing, in order 
to ease the government here, which had been so willing to 
ease us, that the Congress might furnish their army in 
America with provisions in part of payment for the ser- 
vices lent us. This proposition, I was told, was well 
taken ; but it being considered that the States having the 
enemy in their country, and obliged to make great expenses 
for the present campaign, the furnishing so much provisions 
as the French army might need, might straiten and be 
inconvenient to the Congress, his majesty did not at this 
time think it right to accept the offer. You will not 
wonder at my loving this good prince : he will win the 
hearts of all America. 

If you are not so fortunate in Spain, continue however 
the even good temper you have hitherto manifested. 
Spain owes us nothing ; therefore, whatever friendship she 
shows us in lending money or furnishing clothes, &c. 
though not equal to our wants and wishes, is however tant 
de gagne ; those who have begun to assist us, are more 
likely to continue than to decline, and we are still so much 
obliged as their aids amount to. But I hope and am con- 
fident, that court will be wiser than to take advantage of 
our distress, and insist on our making sacrifices by an 
agreement, which the circumstances of such distress would 
hereafter weaken, and the very proposition can only give 
disgust at present. Poor as we are, yet as I know wc 
shall be rich, I would rather agree with them to buy at a 
great price the whole of their right on the Mississippi, 
than sell a drop of its waters. A neighbour might as well 
ask me to sell my street door. 

I wish you could obtain an account of what they have 
supplied us with already in money and goods. 

Mr. Grand, informing me that one of the bills drawn on 
you having been sent from hence to Madrid, was come 
back unaccepted, I have directed him to pay it ; and he 



G4 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

has, at my request, undertaken to write to the Marquis 
D'Yranda, to assist you with money to answer such bills 
as you are not otherwise enabled to pay, and to draw on 
him for the amount, which drafts I shall answer here as far 
as 25,000 dollars. If you expect more, acquaint me. But 
pray write to Congress as I do, to forbear this practice, 
which is so extremely hazardous, and may, some time or 
other, prove very mischievous to their credit and affairs. 
I have undertaken, too, for all the bills drawn on Mr. 
Laurens, that have yet appeared. He was to have sailed 
three days after Mr. Searle, that is, the 18th July. Mr. 
Searle begins to be in pain for him, having no good opinion 
of the little vessel he was to embark in. 

We have letters from America to the 7th August. The 
spirit of our people was never higher. Vast exertions 
making preparatory for some important action. Great 
harmony and affection between the troops of the two na- 
tions. The new money in good credit, &c. 

I will write to you again shortly, and to Mr. Carmichael. 
I shall now be able to pay up your salaries complete for the 
year ; but as demands unforeseen are continually coming 
upon me, I still retain the expectations you have given me 
of being reimbursed out of the first remittances you 
receive. 

If you find any inclination to hug me for the good news 
of this letter, I constitute and appoint Mrs. Jay my attorney, 
to receive in my behalf your embraces. With great and 
.sincere esteem, 

I have the honour to be, dear sir, 

Your most obedient and most humble servant,

TO BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. 

Madrid, 30th Oct., 1780. 

Dear Sir. 

The pleasure given me by your letter of the 2d instant, 
may more easily be conceived than expressed. I am greatly 
obliged by your attention to my embarrassments. In my 
last on that subject which you received, was a copy of my 
letter to Count De Vergennes, from which it appeared that 
the sum I should have occasion for would probably be con- 
siderable, and far exceeding 25,000 dollars. Bills to the 
amount of 100,000 dollars have arrived. A loan cannot be 
effected here. What the court will do is as yet uncertain, 
and will long continue so. I should have replied to your 
letter before, but as I daily expected to hear from Count 
De Vergennes, I waited, with a view of mentioning the 
import to you. The enclosed copy of a note 1 received 
from Count Montmorin, contains all the advices I have on 
that head. My situation continues unpleasant, and though 
my endeavours are not wanting to better it, future events 
are too uncertain to be relied upon. To be active, prudent, 
and patient, is in my power ; but whether I shall reap as 
w T ell as sow and water, God only knows. 

I have often been told of the former supplies, and asked 
how they were to be reimbursed. My answer has uni- 
formly been, that I knew neither their amount nor terms, 
and that I wished to be furnished with an account of both, 
»x:e. &c. As yet I have not been able to obtain it. 

Some mistake must have given occasion to any of the 
bills drawn on me being returned without acceptance. 
The fact is, that though I often delayed (with the consent 
of the holders), yet I never refused to accept any of them. 

I have written several letters to Congress, requesting 
them to forbear drawing further bills till proper funds should 
be established for their payment. Mere contingent assur- 
ances, or flattering inferences drawn from flattering expres-

for serious measures. 

Cornwallis, it seems, has cropped some of Gates's laurels : 
and Mr. Laurens is in the Tower. European politicians 
will, I suppose, though often deceived in the same way, 
again think America on her knees in the dust. Had Ter- 
nay been supported, the campaign would have had a differ- 
ent termination. Much money and spirit has been wasted 
by this disappointment. Of the latter, indeed, we shall 
never be in want, and I should be happy if the like could 
be said of the former. The conduct of France towards us 
has been friendly ; and though I cannot forbear to think she 
has been too inattentive to this object, my gratitude towards 
her is not impaired by it. I regret it as a misfortune, not 
blame it as a designed omission. 

I wrote to you last week, and now enclose a duplicate 
of another letter. You may rely on my reimbursing you 
the advances on account of our salaries, out of the first 
remittances I receive. 

I have often congratulated my country and myself on 
your being at present in France. I once expected to have 
seen you there, and to have profited by the lessons which 
time and much experience have taught you. Miracles have 
ceased, and my constitution does not promise length of 
days, or I should probably desire you, when you ascend, to 
drop me your mantle. That you may long retain it is one 
of the prayers of 

Your friend and servant, 

John Jay.

Madrid, 19th Nov., 1780. 

Dear Sir, 

I have lately received a letter from Francis Child, a lad 
whom I had taken by the hand after his father's death, and 
put apprentice to Mr. Dunlap, your printer. He complains 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 67 

that Dunlap refuses to give him the clothes stipulated in the 
indentures, and requests that 1 will save him from naked- 
ness. You will oblige ine by giving him twenty-five bard 
dollars, or tbe amount of it in paper. If you can conve- 
niently discover how he behaves and is like to turn out, I 
beg you will inform me ; for, as bis father bad a warm and 
steady attachment to me, I feel myself interested in the 
welfare of this son, who it seems was his favourite. 

My friend, you arc not a little indebted to me on the 
score of letters. One only has reached me. I am content 
to go on writing two or three for one, but really you must 
let us hear sometimes of you and Mrs. Morris. There are 
some hearts which, like feathers, stick to every thing they 
touch, and quit each with equal case. Mine is not one of this 
kind ; it adheres to few, but it takes strong hold ; you must, 
therefore, write to me ; and if you would make your letter 
very agreeable, dwell on tbe objects you will find at or near 
the hills, and within your own walls. Mrs. Jay writes 
by this opportunity to Mrs. Morris, whom she loves and 
esteems for many reasons unnecessary to repeat to you. 

Should the following cipher reach you safe, we may after- 
ward write with less reserve. Entick's Spelling Dictionary, 
printed in 1777, paged backwards. The last page in the 
book is numbered 468. Let this be page the first, and 
mark the first page (which is the titlepage) 468. Count the 
words from the top, distinguishing the columns by a [.] over 
the first figure for the first column, and a [.] over the second 
figure for the second column. For instance, the word 
absent is the fifth word in the first column of the 434th 
page, and is to be thus written : 5.434. 

Remember me to your friends, Mr. and Mrs. Mease, 
and your other usual guests near the hills. I wish I had a 
few such honest, open-hearted companions here. God bless 
you. 

I am, dear sir, very sincerely, your friend, 6cc. 

John Jay. 



68 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 



TO EGBERT BENSON, ESQ. 

Madrid, Nov., 1780. 

Dear Benson, 

There seems to be a spell in the pens of my friends in 
New- York. Except Livingston, I have not had a line from 
either of them since I left America ; not even from either 
of my brothers, nor from you, who also are several letters 
in my debt. I have a favour to ask of you ; it is that you 
would make a visit to my father, and send me a minute 
account of his health, and that of the family. Make a half 
dozen copies of your letter, and send them either, to some 
friend at Boston, or to Mr. Robert Morris, at Philadelphia, 
to be forwarded in different vessels. Don't neglect to do 
me this friendly office. You can easily conceive how pain- 
ful it is to be so long in ignorance and suspense, about the 
situation and welfare of persons so nenr and dear to me, as 
many of thosn are to whom I allude. Tell me also how 
your mother and brothers do ; and believe me to be, as I 
have long been, your 

Affectionate friend, 

John Jay. 

to e. gerry, of massachusetts. 

Madrid, 9th Jan., 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

I should have much wondered what could have detained 
my letter, mentioned in yours of 20th September last, so 
long from you, had not my correspondence been strangely 
interrupted ever since my arrival. 

Your Constitution gives me much satisfaction. It ap- 
pears to me to be, upon the whole, wisely formed and well 
digested. I find that it describes your State as being in 
New-England, as well as in America. Perhaps it would 
be better if these distinctions were permitted to die away. 

Your predictions respecting the fate of Lord Cornwallis 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENT E. 69 

have, thank God! been verified. It is a glorious, joyful, 
and important event. Britain feels the force of that stroke, 

and other nations berrin to doubt less of the continuance of 
our independence. Further successes must prepare the 
way for peace; and I hope that victory will stimulate, 
instead of relaxing our exertions. 

Although myself and my family have most severely suf- 
fered by the continental money, I am resigned to its fate. 
Provided we preserve our liberty and independence, I shall 
be content. Under their auspices, in a fruitful country, and 
by patient industry, a competence may always be acquired, 
and I shall never cease to prefer a little with freedom, to 
opulence without it. 

Your account of the plenty which abounds in our country 
is very flattering, and ought to excite our gratitude to the 
Hand that gives it. While our governments tax wisely, 
reward merit, and punish offenders, we shall have little to 
fear. The public has been too much a prey to peculation. 
Economy and strict accounts ought to be, and continue, 
among the first objects of our attention. 

I have not heard any thing for a long time respecting 
our disputed lines. In my opinion, few things demand more 
immediate care than this subject; and I differ from those 
who think that such matters had better be postponed till 
after the war. At present, a sense of common danger 
guaranties our union. We have neither time nor inclina- 
tion to dispute among ourselves. Peace will give us lei- 
sure, and leisure often finds improper occasions for employ- 
ment. I most sincerely wish that no disputes may survive 
the war ; and that on the return of peace, we may con- 
gratulate each other on our deliverance and prospects of 
uninterrupted felicity, without finding ourselves exposed to 
differences and litigations, which never fail to make impres- 
sions injurious to that cordiality and confidence which both 
our interest and our duty call upon us to cultivate and 
,eherish.

Mrs. Jay charges me to present her compliments to you. 
I am, dear sir, with great and sincere esteem, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

John Jay. 

to benjamin franklin. 

Madrid, 21st Feb., 1781. 
Dear Sir, 

Your favour of the 15th ult., with the packets mentioned 
in it, arrived in good order. I regret your long silence, 
though I am strongly inclined to rejoice in the cause of it : 
a lit of the gout, it is said, often prolongs life. 

Affairs here begin to wear a better aspect. I am prom- 
ised 3,000,000 rials, that is, 150,000 dollars, which, though 
inadequate to the demands upon me, is still a great conso- 
lation, especially as men who are at the pains of planting 
and watering trees, seldom let them perish for want of a 
few drops extraordinary. 

I scarcely know how to desire you to make further ad- 
vances on account of our salary, four months of which is 
now due, and yet I find myself under a necessity of doing 
it. My expenses here, notwithstanding the most rigid 
economy, are very great. 

Since writing the above, I have had the pleasure of re- 
ceiving yours of the 27th January, and sincerely con- 
gratulate you on your recovery. The amount of my bill 
on you shall, agreeable to your request, be considered as 
part of the 25,000 dollars. Your reckoning, as to our 
salaries, corresponds with mine, though we have been 
losers by the exchange. 

As to the residue of the 25,000 dollars, my drafts shall 
be entirely regulated by my necessities, and I shall be 
happy if they permit me to leave a considerable proportion 
of that sum in your hands. I shall be constrained, however, 
to call for a part of that sum shortly ; but whether by a bill, 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 71 

or by means of the marquis,* is uncertain. As to that 
gentleman's complaint of my reserve towards him, I could 
make many remarks, which, though proper for your perusal, 
ought not to go further. 

A few days after my arrival here, a person, whom I was 
told was the marquis, was introduced to me. He said he 
came to pay me a visit by order of Mr. Grand. I did not 
then know I was indebted to that gentleman for a letter of 
recommendation to the marquis, it not having come to my 
hands. This singularity struck me, though I appeared not 
to observe it. The civilities usual on such occasions 
passed between us, and at parting the marquis gave me a 
general invitation to dine with him whenever I should find 
it convenient. I returned his visit, but as general invita- 
tions from strangers pass with us for mere matters of com- 
pliment, I declined doing myself the honour of dining with 
him. Interchanges of visits were continued, and the gen- 
eral invitation to dine once or twice repeated. In this line 
my connexion with the marquis remained, until I received 
the offer of the king's responsibility for a loan, &c. Several 
reasons induced me to think it expedient to consult the 
marquis as to the manner of making this offer useful to us. 
I waited upon him for that purpose. He told me he could 
not intermeddle in these affairs without instructions from the 
court; but was nevertheless very civil, and expressed a 
desire of doing me services, &c. As he declined entering 
into particulars, I did not press it ; nor had my ideas of 
his importance risen so high as to reconcile me to the ex- 
traordinary and unnecessary measure of applying to the 
court for the instructions in question. I did not, however, 
let him know my sentiments or intentions on the subject. 
It seems he had heard of Mr. Grand having been desired 
by you to make inquiries for money for me, and he advised 

* The Marquis D'Yranda. 



72 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

me to write to him on the subject, which I accordingly did.- 
In his answer of the 21st October, he says, "I am very 
unhappy to hear you are not benefited on the spot by the 
facility tendered to you by the court of Spain, so much 
more so that the nature of circumstances here does not 
admit of the least hope of success. Too many attempts, 
all vainless, have already been made for the good of your 
credit ; adding any more to the numberwould be destructive 
to it entirely, at this particular juncture chiefly when our 
government is about raising a sum of money much more 
enticing and advantageous in its conditions. This perplex- 
ing situation suggested me an idea I communicated to Dr. 
Franklin," &c. 

" Meanwhile it is highly important to avail yourself of the 
favourable disposition of the court of Spain, and get it to 
authorize and charge the marquis to help you in your 
finance business. He writes me that without orders he 
cannot take it upon himself. It will be better for your ex- 
cellency not to consult him before making the application 
to government," &c. 

You, my good friend, have seen and thought too much 
of men and things to need any of my remarks on this 
letter. I replied to it on the 1st November as follows : 

" Sir, 

" I have had the honour of receiving your letter of the 
21st October last. I had flattered myself that a loan on 
reasonable terms and adequate security might have been 
effected for the United States in France ; but as that court 
is raising money on conditions more advantageous and 
agreeable, I am not surprised at our having little prospect 
of success. 

" The hint you gave Dr. Franklin was a good one, and I 
hopo will be productive of good consequences. 

"Your obliging advice relative to the marquis, shall meet 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 73 

with all the attention due to its importance ; and if that 
measure should, on further consideration, appear expedient, 
it shall be pursued in the manner you recommend. 

The marquis repeating his general invitation about this 
time, I dined with him. He received and entertained me 
very politely. We parted, to appearances, pleased with 
each other ; but he has not been at my house since, though 
a great many visits in my debt. 

Ever since my arrival, I have been particularly cautious 
to avoid offending any person of any rank ; to endeavour to 
please all, without becoming the property or sycophant of 
any. My disagreeable situation was not unknown to him, 
but the inferences he drew from it proved fallacious. I 
never find myself less disposed to humility, or improper 
compliances, than when fortune frowns. I have uniformly 
been very civil, though not confidential, to the marquis, nor 
has any thing harsh ever passed between us. He is a man 
of business, abilities, and observation, and (what is of much 
importance here) of money. He keeps the most, and 
indeed only, hospitable house here, and persons of the first 
rank and fashion are found at his table. His consequence 
at court is unequal to his desires, and I think to his capacity 
of being useful. In a word, he has a good share of sagacity, 
ambition, and pride. I think it probable that we shall yet 
be on more familiar terms ; for though I will never court, I 
shall with pleasure cultivate his acquaintance. 

The Count de Montmorin continues very friendly. I 
believe him to be an able minister, and well attached to 
our cause. 

Mrs. Jay desires me to make her compliments to you. 
I am, dear sir, with sincere attachment and esteem, 

Your most obedient servant, 

John Jay.

TO EGBERT BENSON. 

Madrid, March, 1781. 
Dear Benson, 

Either some very singular fatality must have attended 
the letters of my New- York friends to me, or they have 
given mc abundant reason to complain of them as corre- 
spondents ; not one letter to me, dated in our State, has 
reached me since I left America. 

I have written to you from Martinico, from Cadiz, and 
from this place ; some of these letters, I have reason to think, 
arrived safe, though several others have probably miscarried. 
Your governor is largely in my debt, and so is General 
Schuyler, whom I always thought a very punctual corre- 
spondent. How am I to account for this ? I cannot per- 
suade myself that neglect is among the causes. Business 
seldom continues a good excuse for a year together, and 
indolence, often a real, is never an admissible one. 

The vulgar proverb, out of sight, out of mind, always 
appeared to me in the light of a vulgar error, when applied 
to old friends and companions. I hope I have not been 
mistaken, especially as the contrary of that proposition is 
true with respect to myself. I never loved or admired 
America so much as since I left it, and my attachment to 
my friends in it seems to have increased, in proportion as 
distance of time and place separated me from them. The 
remark that we seldom estimate blessings justly till we are 
about to lose them for a time, or altogether, is, I believe, 
frequently true, and perhaps that circumstance has tightened 
the cords which bind me to my friends and country. I 
could carry your recollection back to days that are past, 
and entertain you with the shades of many departed 
pleasures, in which we had been partakers. These shades 
speak a language that I hope your heart understands as 
well as mine, and I still flatter myself that their voice, 
though not loud, will be sufficient to awaken a remembrance

of the sincere attachment and regard, with which I have 
long been, and still am, 

Your affectionate friend and servant, 

John Jay. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Madrid, 29th March, 1781. 

There has long, my dear sir, been something about my 
heart which urged me to write to you ; but I thought it 
selfish to diminish your few leisure moments by an addi- 
tional correspondent, especially as your punctuality and 
attention would probably have led you to consult my wishes 
rather than your own convenience. The time, I hope, will 
come, when the return of tranquillity will give me an opp< >r- 
tunity of conversing with you on several interesting subjects. 
I have, however, concluded to allow myself the pleasure of 
writing you a few lines now and then. Indeed, I ought to 
have recollected, that while I was giving myself credit in 
my own mind for self-denial, you might have been charging 
me in yours for inattention ; and, therefore, that it might 
have been more prudent, and perhaps not less generous, to 
have troubled you with letters, than with inducements to 
suspect that my heart, like a feather, would, with equal ease, 
stick to, or quit any man on whom the breath of whim or 
interest might blow it on or off. 

The firmness and delicacy observed in the case of Major 
Andre, is exceedingly admired here. I am happy Colonel 
Beverley did not succeed in renewing his acquaintance with 
you. You have really been very fortunate in having so 
long resisted the attacks of open enemies, and escaped the 
snares of secret ones. 

I take the liberty of sending you a cask of Packaretti, the 
favourite wine of our late friend, Don Juan, whose death I 
much lament. His place will, I believe, be soon filled by a 
gentleman who will probably deliver you a letter of intro- 
duction from me. 



76 LIFE OP JOHN JAY. 

Mr. Harrison, a very worthy kinsman of your secretary, is 
shipping from Cadiz the clothing taken by Admiral Cordova, 
and presented by France and Spain to Congress. I have 
desired him to send you invoices of each parcel. 

Mrs. Jay has more than usual health, and seems as much 
interested in your health and safety, as if you was her own 
father, as well as that of her country. Be pleased to present 
our best wishes to Mrs. Washington ; and when you write 
to your honest friend, Colonel Harrison, remember me to 
him. I hope Arnold has not spoiled his mill-dam. God

Madrid, April, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

Notwithstanding my repeated and earnest applications 
to the Count de Florida Blanca, I have as yet been able to 
obtain only $34,880 of the 8150,000 expressly promised 
me in December last. He has, on the contrary, assured 
me that this promise cannot be complied with in less than 
six months. It therefore became necessary to communi- 
cate my embarrassments to the ambassador of France, and 
to request his friendly aid and interposition. You will per- 
ceive, by the enclosed account, that the bills I have accepted 
and what still remain to be paid (exclusive of those at two 
months' sight, for the payment of which you authorized me 
to draw upon you) amount to $231,303; of which 
$89,083 will be payable this month,

MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. ',', 

The ambassador was very sensible of the pernicious 
consequences which would follow a protest of these bills, 
and, I must do him the justice to say, interested himself 
warmly in endeavouring to extricate me from that necessity. 
He has had different conferences with the Count D. F. B. on 
the subject, and yesterday he promised the ambassador posi- 
tively to pay the $89,083 which will be due in April, in the 
course of six months, in six equal payments, reckoning 
from next May ; but as this money still left me without 
relief as to the April bill, he engaged the Marquis d'Yranda 
to advance the sums necessary to pay them, and which I 
shall accordingly receive from him. Thus, my dear sir. I 
have been, as it were, reprieved by the kind offices of the 
French ambassador, from protesting any of the bills due 
this month ; but every ensuing month will bring with it new 
dangers and solicitudes, and particularly the month of May, 
in the course of which I shall be called upon for no less 
than 896,288. I am in a cruel situation, and without the 
least expectation of succour except from France. I there- 
fore think it necessary to inform you of the delicate state 
of our affairs here by express, and to entreat you to use 
your utmost endeavours to provide me, by his return, with 
funds adequate to the bills accepted, and wdiich at present 
amount to $142,220, without including either those which 
may yet arrive, or the $89,083 due this month, and for the 
payment of which I expect to reimburse the Marquis 
d'Yranda with the money promised by the minister in the 
monthly payment before mentioned. 

The Marquis d'Yranda, whom I saw yesterday at the 
French ambassador's, has further agreed, at the ambassa- 
dor's request, to furnish me with the further sum of $142,220 
as I shall have occasion for it, provided Mr. Grand will 
accept his drafts to that amount. It is therefore of the last 
importance that arrangements for this purpose be imme- 
diately taken with that gentleman, and that I receive, by 
the return of the express, his order on the marquis to fur- 



78 



MFE OF JOHN JAY. 



nish me at least with the sum of 8142,220 ; without which 
it will be impossible for me to pay these bills. 

The ambassador will also write by this courier, and I 
have little doubt but that your court will generously inter- 
pose on this, as they have on several other occasions, to 
prevent events prejudicial to America in particular, and the 
common cause in general. I am also constrained to add, 
that our situation here is daily becoming more disagreeable 
from the want of our salaries. To be obliged to contract 
debts and live on credit is terrible. I have not, to this day, 
received a shilling from America ; and we should indeed 
have been greatly distressed, had it not been for your good 
offices. Endeavour, I beseech you, to provide us with sup- 
plies on this account, and deliver me, if possible, from the 
many disagreeable sensations which such a variety of un- 
pleasant circumstances naturally creates. Remember that 
new bills are still arriving. 

Be pleased to communicate this letter to Mr. Laurens, 
who, I am persuaded, will cheerfully afford you all the aid 
in his power. 

I have directed the courier to wait your orders, and then 
return without further delay. 

I am, dear sir, 
Your friend and humble servant, 

John Jay. 

P.S. You will perceive, from the enclosed account, that 
I shall be under the necessity of drawing upon you for ten 
or twelve thousand dollars, on account of the twenty-five 
thousand, before it will be possible to hear from you on the 
subject. 

TO CHARLES THOMPSON. 

Madrid, 23d April, 1781. 
Dear Sir, 

On the 30th January last, I had the pleasure of receiving 

vour very acceptable letter of the 12th October, 1780. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 79 

The able manner in which it treats the important subject of 
American finances induced me to give that part of it to the 
minister, and to send a copy of the same extract to Dr. 
Franklin, who, in his answer, says — " I thank you for com- 
municating to me the letter of the secretary of Congress on 
our finances. It gives light which I had not before, and 
may be useful here." 

I wish in my heart that you was not only secretary of 
Congress, but secretary also for foreign affairs. I should 
then have better sources of intelligence than gazettes and 
reports. 

My public letter contains a state of our affairs here. I 
flatter myself that Congress will never again attempt to 
form an alliance on principles of equality in forma pau- 
peris. 

Before their ingenious letter on our right to the Missis- 
sippi arrived, it was known in Europe ; and the subject of 
my last instructions on that head was no secret here before 
they reached this side of the ocean. I would tell vou mure, 
had I now time to write in ciphers ; but the gentleman who 
is to carry these despatches is waiting for them. 

The want of a regular and safe communication between 
Congress and their foreign ministers gives occasion to 
various inconveniences. Every letter known or suspected 
to be for or from me, that gets into the post-offices, is 
opened, often kept back for a while, and, to my certain 
knowledge, sometimes suppressed entirely. 

Hence it happens that Congress receives from me fewer 
letters than I could wish, or than their affairs may demand. 
The expense of private couriers is intolerable, nor can many 
in that character be found who merit confidence. 

The unseasonable arrival of bills, without being preceded 
by funds, and the train of perplexing consequences resulting 
from that and other causes not in my power to prevent, 
have given me some anxious hours, and often rendered my 
situation uneasy. 



80 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

It is my business, however, to reflect, that pleasure was 
not the object for which I came here, and that obstacles 
should rather excite than repress perseverance. 

Be pleased to present Mrs. Jay's and my compliments 
to Mrs. Thompson, and believe me to be with sincere 
regard and esteem, 

Y our most obedient servant, 

John Jay. 

from robert morris. 

Philadelphia, June 5th, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

I must freely acknowledge the justice of your charge 
against me as a bad correspondent, for the force of truth 
would convict, were I to deny, and perhaps friendship will 
hardly bear with palliatives ; but knowing well your attach- 
ment to, and practice of sincerity, I shall honestly tell you I 
did not like to write on political matters, and in what may 
be called domestic, you had constantly better information 
than 'twas possible for me to give, having also very ample 
employment for my time : you will reflect, that all these 
circumstances combined to make me silent, although not 
inattentive or forgetful of my friends abroad. 

I have three letters from you, dated the 28th May, 16th 
September, and 19th November last, and feel myself ex- 
ceedingly indebted to that partiality which prompted you to 
say many civil things ; these are stamped with an unusual 
value, not because I sutler myself to think they are merited, 
but because you thought so. We have heard more of you 
and Mrs. Jay than these letters tell me, and upon the whole 
have not found much cause to be pleased with your situa- 
tion. Hers must too often have been very disagreeable ; 
the loss of the little one was truly distressing, and your 
almost constant absence extremely hard. But you must 
comfort yourselves with the reflection that still more cruel 
things might have happened, had you remained in your own 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 81 

country. Suppose you had been with your father, when 
some of the enemy's ruffians broke into the house, and after 
satiating themselves with plunder, they had carried you, 
my dear friend, a prisoner to New- York. Think of the 
triumph of your enemies, the distress of your friends, and 
what you must, under such circumstances, have suffered : 
happy that you have escaped such an event, I will not 
prolong the idea of it. 

Our friend Gouverneur has acquainted you with my ap- 
pointment to be superintendant of finance ; the motives of 
my acceptance are purely patriotic, and I would this mo- 
ment give much of my property to be excused ; but pressed 
by my friends, acquaintances, fellow-citizens, and almost 
by all America, I could not resist. I will therefore most 
assiduously try to be useful, and if in this I do but succeed, 
my recompense will be ample. Gouverneur and others 
have promised me the assistance of their abilities. Con- 
gress promise support; if the Legislatures and individuals 
will do the same, we will soon change the face of our 
affairs, and show our enemies that their hopes of our ruin, 
through the channel of finance, is as vain as their hope of 
conquest. 

This campaign, as usual, opens to our disadvantage ; but 
I expect it will also, as usual, close favourably for us. The 
vices and follies of our enemies may justly be counted 
among the number of our fast friends. They never fail to 
work for our relief in the hour of distress ; for at those 
times the pride, insolence, and tyranny of the British heroes 
are too insufferable to be borne, even by the peasantry of 
America. It affords me much pleasure to find the assist- 
ance I have given towards delivering supplies at Havannah,

sincere affection. I am 

Your obedient, humble servant, 

Robert Morris. 

to J. SMITH. 

Aranjuez, 5th June, 1781. 

Sir, 

So many letters both for and from me miscarry, that I 
take this opportunity of informing you, that I have had the 
pleasure of writing to you by the way of Cadiz, and that I 
consider myself much obliged by your favour of the 27th 
Feb. last, which did not come to my hands till long after it. 
must have arrived here. The intelligence communicated 
by it was no less welcome than interesting. We wait with 
impatience for further information respecting the military 
operations in the southern States. Lord Cornwallis's ex- 
pedition bears some marks of rashness, and I cannot but 
expect he will have some reason to repent it. I think his 
temper and measures well calculated to enrage and disci- 
pline the southern militia ; if so, his victories will render 
his enemies more numerous and formidable than ever. The 
ratification of the confederation, and the firm establishment 
of civil government in the different states, are circumstances 
very friendly to the American cause, and should be viewed 
by our enemies as insurmountable obstacles to our again 
becoming their subjects. Such, however, is their infatua- 
tion and their obstinacy, that there appears very little rea- 
son to flatter ourselves with a speedy peace, unless this 
campaign should produce events greatly to their prejudice. 
I hope, therefore, that our countrymen will not suffer them- 
selves to be amused with such delusive expectations, but on 
the contrary will persevere vigorously and systematically 
in preparing to prosecute the war. 

I am, sir, your most obedient and humble servant, 

John Jay. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE, s.'j 

TO BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. 

Madrid, July 9th, 1781. 
Dear Sir, 

Many weeks have elapsed since I have been favoured 
with an}- letters from you. I have rec< ived a letter from 
Colonel Laurens, dated at sea, and covering the one here- 
with enclosed for you. A vessel has arrived at Bilboa, in 
twenty-four days from Salem. I received by her some 
family letters, which came from Bilboa under cover to a 
gentleman here. She brought for me a large packet, which 
was put into the post-office, and ought to have come to 
hand a week ago. I have inquired for it, but in vain. 
This is not an uncommon case, and shows how necessary 
it is that Congress should take some other means for con- 
veying intelligence to and from their ministers than the 
European post-offices. Be pleased to make my compli- 
ments to your grandson, and remind him that he is three 
letters in my debt. 

You will also find herewith enclosed a copy of a letter I 
have received from Silas Talbot, a prisoner at Plymouth, 
requesting aid. 

This gentleman gives a true description of himself. He 
has on various occasions acted like a very brave and en- 
terprising officer, and the journals of Congress contain 
ample evidence of it. I sincerely lament his situation, and 
regret that my own does not put it in my power to afford 
him relief. The far greater part of the money which the 
public demands require here, I draw from you. The 
amount of the bills drawn upon me by Congress far ex- 
ceeds that of the funds prepared for their payment, and 
the debts already incurred on account of distressed Ameri- 
can seamen still remain unpaid. It would not be delicate 
in me to advance money to Colonel Talbot, and then re- 
quest the favour of you to replace it, especially as his 
situation places him more immediately under your care 



84 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

than mine. All that I can therefore do with propriety is 
to make you acquainted with his case. He has served his 
country zealously, and has a right to her care ; gratitude 
as well as policy dictates it. I fear too little attention has 
in general been paid to our captive seamen. I often hear 
of many entering into the enemy's service for want of 
bread, and for ill treatment not retaliated ; even those who 
have had the good fortune and address to escape, are fre- 
quently obliged, in seeking opportunities to return home, to 
wander about from place to place, friendless, penniless, 
ignorant of the language of the strangers through whose 
Land they pass, making known their wants only by the voice 
of distress, and subsisting on the wretched husks cast to 
them by the frugal hand of charity. Nor is this all: 
although their misfortunes, on finding American vessels 
bound home, ought to recommend them to their brethren, 
yet it too often happens that masters of American vessels 
inhumanly refuse (unless paid passage-money) to carry 
home these unfortunate people, though offering to do duty 
without wages as sailors during the voyage. 

I am, dear sir, with sincere esteem and regard, 

Your obliged and affectionate servant, 

John Jay.

Late of the Washington, ship of war, 

Madrid, 14th July, 1781. 

Sir, 

Although I have not had the pleasure of your acquaint- 
ance, I am not a stranger to your merit. 

On receiving your favour of the 11th ult., I sent a copy 
of it to his excellency Dr. Franklin, and warmly recom- 
mended your case to his attention. I am persuaded he will 
do all in his power for your relief, and that the distinguished

prisoner of war in England. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. sf> 

manner in which you have served our country, will 
always be considered as giving you a title to her care and 
protection. 

Not being authorized by Congress to provide for Ameri- 
can prisoners in England, I could not justify undertaking it, 
and therefore referred your application to Dr. Franklin, 
within whose department that business appears to me 
to fall. 

I shall always be ready as an individual to contribute to 
the relief of my distressed countrymen, and should now 
give you proof of it ; but as your case and that of your 
fellow-prisoners ought to be, and probably are provided for 
by the public, I think assistance should there be asked and 
denied, before it can become the duty of private benevo- 
lence to supply public omissions. 

If the application to Dr. Franklin should be fruitless, I 
shall then consider myself bound, as a good American, to 
contribute towards the relief of a fellow-citizen, who has 
so nobly fought in the cause of our country ; and I shall in 
that case desire Mr. Williams, at Nantz, who forwarded 
your letter to me, to advance you fifty dollars on my private 
account ; which sum you will repay to me whenever you 
may be in circumstances to do it, for should misfortunes 
delay or prevent your being in that situation, it would be 
more agreeable to me to advance you a farther sum, than 
to demand the repayment of this. 

I am, sir, with real esteem, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

John Jay. 

to frederick jay. 

Madrid, 31st July, 1781. # 

My dear Brother, 

We have heard (though not from you) that a number of 
armed robbers have paid you a visit, and taken from the 
family their money, plate, &c. ; it is also said that they 



86 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

behaved towards our father, Peter, and Nancy, with more 
decency and respect than people of that class generally 
observe. I am very sensible of the distress which this 
misfortune must have occasioned ; my having, however, in 
two of my former letters, which I hope have arrived safe, 
desired you to draw upon me for one hundred pounds ster- 
ling, in two sets of bills of fifty pounds each, gives me 
much consolation ; should this not be adequate to your exi- 
gences, you may draw upon me for thirty pounds sterling 
more. While I have any thing, a share of it shall be 
appropriated to the wants of the family. I thank God that 
by means of economy, I shall be able to afford them some 
assistance from time to time, and in some measure mitigate 
the calamities brought upon them by the war, and the trans- 
mutation of their gold into paper. 

On the 25th of June last, Mr. Harrison, at Cadiz, shipped 
at my request, and on my account and risk, by the Black 
Prince, Captain John Robertson, bound from thence for 
Philadelphia, one bale marked I. Jay, to be delivered to 
Mr. Robert Morris, and containing 67 f Spanish yards of 
coarse cloth, and 70 1 yards of baize for lining. 

If this arrives safe, it will help to keep your servants 
warm next winter. A Spanish yard is somewhat less than 
an English one. Miss Katy Livingston writes me, that 
one little parcel of salt I sent you, was then safe in Mr. 
Morris's custody, and that she had by letter informed you 
of it. I have since sent another parcel of a dozen or fif- 
teen bushels. I think you would do well to write to Mr. 
Morris now and then, and enclose to him such of your 
letters for me as you may intend to go by vessels from 
Philadelphia. 

On considering the state of the family, I am really at a 
loss to see how the number of it can be considerably 
reduced. As to the old servants, who have expended 
their strength and youth for the family, they ought and 
must be taken good care of, while we have the means 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 87 

of doing it; common justice, and I may say gratitude, de- 
mands it. 

Upon the whole I believe it will be best, considering the 
age, infirmities, and various afflictions of our good old 
lather, not to press him upon these, nor indeed any other 
points that may not be very important, but by leaving his 
mind as much as possible undisturbed, and endeavouring 
daily to soothe and quirt his cares, to render the evening of 
his days as calm and composed as the complication of per- 
plexities which surround him will permit. 

I am told Peggy behaved like a Roman matron, and in 
her conduct towards the robbers showed great firmness 
and presence of mind. Present to her my commendations 
on the occasion. 

I flatter myself that my father's fortitude did not forsake 
him, and therefore, that though he lost money, he did not 
lose health by those rude visiters. Your letter made me 
happy by assuring me that his strength continued as when 
I left him. God grant that I may find it the same on my 
return. I really regret Nancy's* ill-health ; it should be 
better if my prayers and wishes could avail. You must 
endeavour to keep up each others spirits, and oppose mis- 
fortunes with manly firmness and cheerful resignation. 

We are all well. Remember us affectionately to all the 
family. 

I am, dear Frederick, 

Your very affectionate brother, 

John Jay.

88 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

a number of armed men. It is said, they behaved with 
uncommon respect to you, and humanity towards Peter and 
Nancy. If this be true, they deserve credit for the manner 
in which they executed their purposes. The loss sustained 
on that occasion must have been the more severely felt, as 
the situation of the country, and the injuries you had suf- 
fered from the enemy, and the depreciation of the paper 
money, rendered it difficult for you to repair it. I thank 
God, however, that you lost nothing but property — your 
lives were spared. I beseech you not to permit an im- 
proper degree of delicacy to prevent your deriving such 
succours from me as may from time to time be convenient. 
I assure you, the reflection that my absence may be the 
means of rendering the situation of the family less distress- 
ing, makes me more reconciled to it than I otherwise 
should be. You have denied yourself much for the sake of 
your children ; and I am much mistaken if some of them 
have not inherited dispositions somewhat similar to those 
of their parents. Had you been less attentive to my educa- 
tion, I should not have been as and where I am. Economy 
will enable me to give you aid, for though I shall spare no 
expense here which my situation may require, yet a tax 
upon avoidable pleasures, amusements, and luxuries, will 
produce a little fund that may and shall be useful to you. 
In my letter to Frederick I have been more explicit on this 
subject. My love to all the family. 

I am, dear sir, 
Your dutiful and affectionate son, 

John Jay.

St. Ildefonso, Sth Sept., 1731. 

Dear Sir, 

Among other letters brought by Major Franks, I had the 
pleasure of receiving one from you, dated in July last. 
From the few of mine that have reached you, it appears 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 89 

they have been very unfortunate, and with many others, 
have probably perished in the ocean. 

I am therefore to repeat my congratulations on the hap- 
piness you derive from the most delicate of all connexions 
with one of the most lovely of her sex. As I am always 
pleased to find those happy who I think deserve to be so, it 
gave me very sensible satisfaction to hear that you had 
both made so judicious a choice, notwithstanding the vi ii 
which that sweet fascinating passion often draws over our 
eyes and understanding. Be pleased to present my compli- 
ments and best wishes to Mrs. Bingham, and to add and 
accept those of Mrs. Jay. who never speaks of Martinico 
without expressing how much we are indebted to you for 
the agreeable manner in which we passed the time we 
staid there. 

Your representation of the state of our affairs is flatter- 
ing, and affords reason to hope that the enemy will soon 
cease to deceive themselves and others by groundless ex- 
pectations of conquest. 

Peace and the negotiations for it are the prevailing topics 
of conversation here, and perhaps in America also. I 
hope, however, that our countrymen will not suffer them- 
selves to be too much influenced by prospects, which may 
prove no less delusive than they are pleasing. To prepare 
vigorously for war is the only sure way of preparing for a 
speedy and valuable peace. 

The Duke de Crillon is in possession of every part of 
Minorca, except Fort St. Philip, which, unless pressed by 
want of provisions or ammunition, will not, I suspect, soon 
or easilv change masters. 

I should mention some other public intelligence ; but 
before this letter can possibly come to your hands, as Major 
Franks will go from hence to Paris, it will cease to be new 
in America. 

It is natural for you to expect that my letters should 

VOL. II. M 



00 UFE OF JOHN JAY. 

now and then contain some traits of this country, its man- 
ners, government, and principal characters. With respect 
to the three first, I make it a rule to be perfectly silent in 
all my letters. The latter is a very delicate subject, and 
men should be well acquainted with a character before 
they attempt to describe it. Much injustice is often done 
by taking reports as facts, and forming opinions of men 
from the suggestions which may arise from envy or inter- 
ested partialities. Though not very old, I have lived too 
long to credit all I hear ; and having been deceived by fair 
as well as unpromising appearances, they have ceased to 
decide my judgment of men. 

Whenever you write to me, which I hope will be often, 
recollect that your letters will, in nine instances out of ten, 
be inspected before they reach me ; write nothing, therefore, 
that you would wish concealed. But as this necessary 
caution may sometimes restrain you from communicating 
what you may think interesting for me to know, I cannot 
omit this opportunity of giving you a cipher, viz. Entick's 
New Spelling Dictionary, printed at London in 1777, which 
you will easily find at Philadelphia ; I bought mine at 
Bell's book-store. Add twenty to the number of the page, 
and ten to that of the word you use. Distinguish the first 
column by a dot over the first figure, and the second 
column by a dot over the second figure. For instance, the 
word duration is the first word in the first column of the 
139th page, and must be thus written, 159 11. Again, the 
word beauty is the tenth word in the second column of the 
60th page, and must be thus written, 80 20. But as it may 
often happen that you may want to write names or words 
which you will not find in the dictionary, use the following 
alphabet in such cases : 

a b c d e f g h i j k 1 m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 
n m 1 k i h f i e d c b a 1 y v x t u r p w s z o y 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 91 

The design of this alphabet is obvious ; use n for a, m 
for b, &c. 

I must now remark that you will have it in your power 
to give me advices of such matters as, though often inter- 
esting, I am seldom favoured with by any of my corre- 
spondents. I mean the state of parties, the views of lead- 
ing individuals, and such intelligence respecting our friends 
and others, as though I might wish to know, ought not to 
be public, and can only be safely communicated in cipher. 

Send your letters for me, under cover, to His Excellency 
the Count de Montmorin, the Ambassador of His Most 
Christian Majesty at this court. 

I fear you will find a correspondence of this kind a little 
troublesome, but I know your industry, talents, and dispo- 
sition to oblige, and therefore, though my letters mav not 
always afford an adequate compensation, I flatter myself 
you will not decline it, especially as you may be assured of 
the utmost prudence and secrecy on my part. 

Be pleased to remember us to all our friends in your 
circle. With sincere regard and attachment, 

I am, dear sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

John Jay.

Madrid, 10th Dec, 1781. •' 

Dear Sir, 

I thank you sincerely for your very friendly letter of the 
21st October last, which I had the pleasure of receiving on 
the 7th inst. I rejoice most cordially with you and every 
other good American, in the important event you commu- 
nicate, and to which you had both the honour and the satis- 
faction of essentially contributing. 

General Washington has favoured me with copies of the 
articles of capitulation, and returns of the prisoners, &c. It 
gives me very sensible pleasure to find that he commanded 



92 UFH OF JOHN JAY. 

in person on this glorious occasion, and had the satisfaction 
of bringing deliverance to his native, and consequently, 
favourite part of America. If Providence shall be pleased 
to lead him, with safety and success, through all the duties 
of his station, and carry him home with the blessings of all 
America on his head, I think he will exhibit to the world 
the most singular instance of virtue, greatness, and good 
fortune united, which the history of mankind has hitherto 
recorded. 

The harmony subsisting between the French troops and 
ours, is an agreeable, as well as an important circumstance, 
and I am glad that the Marquis De La Fayette had an oppor- 
tunity of cutting some sprigs of laurel on one of the enemy's 
redoubts. He has given strong proofs of attachment to our 
cause and country, and as military glory seems to be his 
mistress, he has my .best wishes that she maybe as con- 
stant to him as he has been to us. 

General Greene has deservedly acquired great repu- 
tation. He has nobly surmounted a variety of difficulties, 
and his country has fortunately found resources in his 
talents and perseverance, which the peculiar situation of 
the southern States rendered no less seasonable than im- 
portant. 

This campaign ends gloriously for us. How far the 
British counsels may be changed by these events, is as yet 
uncertain. I am much inclined to think that another cam- 
paign will precede a general peace. In my opinion, our 
country would do well to continue making the most vigor- 
ous efforts to render peace more essential to her enemies 
than herself. 

It would give me pleasure to transmit to you some inter- 
esting advices from this quarter of the world. The seiges 
of Gibraltar and Fort St. Philip continue. When they will 
be terminated, is impossible to divine. The Dutch are 
praying for peace, and neglecting the means necessary to 
obtain a proper one. The people do not appear to want

spirit, but their government and their rulers subject them to 
numberless embarrassments. 

France is full of joy and ardour, and will, I believe, do 
her best endeavours to make the next campaign active and 
brilliant. 

The emperor is regulating the internal police of his do- 
minions, encouraging commerce, and extending toleration, 
without suffering himself to be incommoded by ecclesias- 
tical privileges or immunities. He seems to be seriously 
preparing to be great and formidable. He undoubtedly 
possesses the means of power, and it is said, has talents to 
use them to advantage.

My last to you was written on the 16th November,

you. 

I congratulate you on the successful issue of the last 
campaign, to the brilliancy of which the late surrender of 
Fort St. Philip, at Mahon, has much contributed. 

\ our hemisphere brightens fast, and there is reason to 
hope another vigorous campaign will be followed by hal- 
cyon days. 

Mr. Benson writes me that your judges are industriously 
serving their country, but that their country had not, as yet, 
made an adequate provision for them. This is bad policy, 
and poverty cannot excuse it. The bench is at present

Passy, April 22 J, 1782. 
Dear Sir, 
I have undertaken to pay all the bills of your acceptance 
that have come to my knowledge, and I hope in God no 
more will be drawn upon us, but when funds are first pro- 
vided. In that case your constant residence at Madrid is 
no longer so necessary. You may make a journey either 
for health or pleasure, without retarding the progress of a 
negotiation not yet begun. Here you are greatly wanted, 
for messengers begin to come and go, and there is much 
talk of a treaty proposed, but I can neither make, nor agree 
to propositions of peace, without the assistance of my col- 
leagues. Mr. Adams, I am afraid, cannot just now leave 
Holland. Mr. Jefferson is not in Europe, and Mr. Laurens 
is a prisoner, though abroad upon parol. I wish, therefore, 
that you would resolve upon the journey, and render your- 
self here as soon as possible. You would be of infinite 
service. Spain has taken four years to consider whether 
she should treat with us or not. Give her forty, and let us 
in the mean time mind our own business. I have much to 
communicate to you, but choose rather to do it viva voce, 
than trust it to letters. 

I am ever, my dear friend, 
Yours most affectionately,

FROM BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. 

Passy, April 24th,1782. 
Dear Sir, 

The Prince de Massaran being so good as to desire carry- 
ing a letter to you, I sit down to write you a few lines-. 
though I hope soon to see you. 

Enclosed I send a copy of one of Mr. Deane's letters ; 
I shall show you more when you come. 

In consequence of a proposition I sent over, the parlia- 
ment of Britain have just passed an act for exchanging 
American prisoners. They have near 1100 in the jails of 
England and Ireland, all committed as charged with high 
treason. The act is to empower the king, notwithstanding 
such commitments, to consider them as prisoners of war, 
according to the law of nations, and exchange them as 
such. This seems to be giving up their pretensions of con- 
sidering us as rebellious subjects, and is a kind of acknow- 
ledgment of our independence. Transports are now taking 
up to carry back to their country the poor, brave fellows. 
who have borne for years their cruel captivity, rather than 
serve our enemies, and an equal number of English are to 
be delivered in return. I have, upon desire, furnished pass- 
ports for the vessels. 

Our affairs in Holland are en bon train ; we have some 
prospect of another loan there ; and all goes well here. 

The proposal to us of a separate peace with England, 
has been rejected in the manner you wish, and I am pretty 
certain they will now enter into a general treaty. I 
wrote you a few lines by last post, and on the same day a 
few more by the court courier. They were chiefly to press 
your coming hither to assist in the affair. 

With great and sincere esteem, 
I am ever, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and most humble servant, 

Benjamin Franklin. 



96 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 



TO ROBERT MORRIS. 

Madrid, 25th April, 1782. 
Dear Sir, 

Some of my letters to you have, I find, miscarried by the 
capture of the vessels that were carrying them : and there 
is reason to suspect that two others were stopped here, as 
the letters enclosing them did not reach the persons at the 
seaports to whom they were directed. 

I have heretofore mentioned the receipt of the picture 
you was so kind as to send me, by Mr. Ridley, and the 
arrival of your sons. I don't know the fate of that letter, 
and that uncertainty induces me to repeat my thanks for 
the one, and my congratulations on the other. The estima- 
tion in which I hold your friendship, and the marks I have 
received of it, interest me in every thing which concerns 
you and yours, and be assured that no opportunity of giving 
higher proofs of it shall be omitted. 

Mrs. Jay's time is much employed in nursing and amus- 
ing herself w T ith her little girl. She is writing to Mrs. 
Morris. We are cheerful, and not unhappy, though distant 
from our friends, and deprived of the pleasures which re- 
sult from that free and unreserved conversation which can 
only be indulged in the company of safe companions, or in 
a country like ours. 

We remove next week to Aranjuez, where I expect again 
to spend some agreeable weeks. It is a charming place, 
containing a tract of several miles in circumference, and 
divided into gardens, meadows, parks, cultivated grounds, 
and wilds, full of fine trees, fine roads, and fine walks, and 
watered by a slow winding river, which, if more clear, would 
be very beautiful. But still, my friend, it is not America. 
A genius of a different character from that which presides 
at your hills and gardens reigns over these. Soldiers, with 
fixed bayonets, present themselves at various stations in 
these peaceful retreats; and though none but inoffensive 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDED I . f)7 

citizens are near, yet horsemen with drawn swords, guard- 
ing one or other of the royal family in their little excursions 
to take the air daily, renew and impress ideas of subjection. 
Power unlimited, and distrust misplaced, thus exacting 
homage and imposing awe, occasion uneasy reflections, and 
alloy the pleasing sensations which nature, smiling in such 
delightful scenes, never fails to excite. Were I a Spaniard, 
these decorated seats would appear to me like the tempo- 
rary enchantments of some despotic magician, who, by re- 
extending his wand, could at pleasure command them to 
vanish, and be succeeded by galleys and prisons. 

Nothing is more true, than that all things figure by com- 
parison. This elegant seat being surrounded by exclusive 
wastes, appears like a blessed and fortunate island in a 
dreary ocean. The contrast heightens its charms, and 
every traveller arrives with a mind predisposed to admire 
and enjoy them ; but as the first impression wears away, 
and he begins to recollect the more happy, though less 
magnificent abodes in his own country, the attractions and 
allurements of this insensibly diminish. I have more than 
once experienced this, and though not difficult to please or 
be contented, vet I confess that I find little here that resem- 
bles, and nothing that can compensate for the free air, the 
free conversation, the equal liberty, and the other numerous 
blessings which God and nature, and laws of our making, 
have given and secured to our happier country. I would 
not be understood to insinuate, that good society and agree- 
able companions are wanting here. They may, perhaps, 
abound more in some other parts of the world, but they are 
also to be found here, though an unsocial kind of policy 
requires unceasing attention to the most austere rules of 
caution and prudence. The little that I have seen and 
observed of this people, induces me to think that (except 
the generality of those who compose the highest and lowest 
orders), they possess many qualities which are praise-

worthy ; and that two or three long and wise reigns would 
make them a very powerful, and an amiable nation. But 
as I have not had sufficient opportunities of mixing with, 
and personally knowing many of them, time and further 
information may either confirm or alter this opinion. The 
evident suspense and indecision of the court respecting us, 
has kept many at a distance, with whom I should otherwise 
have been on a very familiar footing, and some of them 
have been so candid as to tell me so. This is a kind of 
prudence winch naturally grows out of a jealous and abso- 
lute government, under which the people have, for many 
generations, been habituated to that kind of dependence, 
which constrains every class to watch and respect the 
opinions and inclinations of their superiors in power. The 
prosperous tide of our affairs, however, has for some time 
past run so strong, that I think many of our obstacles here 
must soon give way. Shyness will then cease, and I shall 
not afterward find it difficult to be received into more of 
their houses, and that in the only manner I ever wish to be 
received into any — I mean, at the front door, by direct invi- 
tation from the masters of them, and without the precursory 
good offices of upper servants and unimportant favourites, 
whom I never can submit to court. Until this period ar- 
rives, I shall continue to cultivate the few acquaintances I 
have, and without giving offence to any, endeavour to 
increase their number, whenever it may be done with pro- 
priety and to advantage ; but I shall, as heretofore, avoid 
embarrassing and intruding upon those who, in the mean 
time, may think it necessary to be reserved. Self-respect 
joins with prudence in pointing out this line of conduct; and 
as I have no enemies of my own making, I am persuaded 
that instead of losing, I shall eventually be a gainer, by ad- 
heriag to it, especially as those who may have been led to 
ascribe this conduct to improper motives, will then imme- 
diately find themselves undeceived.

Be pleased to present our compliments and best wishes

to count de montmorin.* 

Paris, 26th June, 1782. 
Dear Sir, 

I devote this first leisure moment which has occurred 
since my arrival, to the pleasure of writing a few lines 
to you. 

Our journey was pursued, without any avoidable inter- 
mission, to Bayonne, where it became advisable to rest a 
few days, and where we received many kind attentions from 
Mons. Formalaguer, to whom, it seems, you had be m so 
obliging as to make friendly mention of us. That city is 
turning its attention to the American trade, and its situation, 
in certain respects, is favourable to that design. 

Your friend, Mons. Risleau, at Bordeaux, pleased me 
much ; there is a frankness in his manner, and a warmth 
about his heart, that is very engaging. I made some agree- 
able acquaintances in that city, and wish I could have staid 
longer with them. Commerce appears to flourish there ; 
and if their trade with America could be properly protected, 
there is reason to think that it would soon become an object 
of great importance. 

On leaving Bordeaux, Mrs. Jay caught an intermitting 
fever, which, with the great demand made for post-horses 
made by the Prince du Nord, delayed us greatly. 

I went with Dr. Franklin to Versailles the day after our 
arrival. The minister spoke of you in terms very friendly, 
and very just, and my next visit would have been to the 
Countess de Montmorin ; but as we learned that a mail was

100 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

to be dismissed for Philadelphia to-day, we returned imme- 
diately to prepare our despatches, so that I have been 
obliged to deny myself the honour of paying my respects 
to a lady, whose character and connexion with you render 
me particularly desirous of seeing. To-morrow we are 
promised a visit from the Marquis de La Fayette and his 
lad} 7 , after which I shall take the first opportunity " meponer 
a los pies de la Condesa Lc Montmorin" I am not sure 
that this is good Spanish ; if not, I wish the inspectors of the 
post-office may be so obliging as to correct it. 

I had written thus far when a variety of interruptions 
prevented my proceeding for several days, and then I be- 
came violently attacked with the influenza, from which I 
am now just beginning to recover. It has been very severe 
on all my family. Mrs. Jay has been obliged to struggle 
with that and the intermittent fever together, and this is 
the first day she has been out of the house since our arrival. 

I am very much mortified at not having yet seen the 
Countess de Montmorin. The day before I was taken sick 
I did myself the honour of calling at her house, but she was 
from home. As soon as the doctor sets me at liberty, the 
first use I will make of it will be to renew my visit. 

What I have seen of France pleases me exceedingly. 
Dr. Franklin has received some late noble proofs of the 
king's liberality, in the liquidation of his accounts, and the 
terms and manner of paying the balance due on them. No 
people understand doing civil things so well as the French. 
The aids they have afforded us received additional value 
from the generous and gracious manner in which they were 
supplied ; and that circumstance will have a proportionable 
decree of influence in cementing the connexion formed 
between the two countries. 

I think the late resolutions and conduct of America, 
respecting Mr. Carlton's proposed correspondence with 
Congress, must have given you pleasure. As Mons. de 
Clonard passed through Spain, he doubtless brought you 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 101 

copies. Some letters and instructions I have received by 
the same vessel, contain strong evidence of the determina- 
tion of Congress to consult the interest and wishes of France 
upon all occasions. 

I have seen and dined with the Count d'Aranda ; his con- 
versation leads me to suspect that his court is, at last, in 
earnest. This, however, is a question which facts, and not 
words, must determine. It is hard to judge of men, espe- 
cially of old politicians ; at present I like the count, for he 
appears frank and candid, as well as sagacious. They say 
he is a little obstinate, but, for my part, I prefer plain-dealing, 
obstinate men, to those unstable ones who, like the moon, 
change once a fortnight, and are mere dispensers of bor- 
rowed light. 

I cannot forbear mentioning, that I am particularly 
indebted to the polite attention of your friend, Count 
d'Estaing. He is at Passy, enjoying otium cam dignitate- 
There is a singular taste displayed in the ornaments of his 
house. The very walls (like Portius in Addison's Cato) 
are ambitiously sententious, and show that they do not 
belong to an ordinary man. 

I am, dear sir, with great esteem and attachment, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

John Jay. 

to robert r. livingston. 

Paris, 13th August, 1782. 
Dear Robert, 

Almost ever since my arrival here I have had, and still 
have, a sick family. The epidemic disorder which has 
spread through the northern part of Europe has been severe 
upon us. I am free from it at present, but it has taken from 
me some flesh and much strength. Mrs. Jay has frequent 
attacks of an irregular intermitting fever, and our little girl 
is not yet wholly out of danger. 

Your letter of the 22d May, and the one enclosed with it 



102 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

from your good mother, contain the first advices I received 
of my father's death. My last letter from Frederick was 
of an earlier date. That intelligence was not unexpected. 
I wish I had been with him ; but it is a temporary separa- 
tion, and I am resigned. It has added to the number of my 
inducements to walk in his steps, and thereby arrive at the 
same home. 

I feel very sensibly for Peter and Nancy. They are ever 
in my thoughts. I thank you sincerely for becoming my 
agent. Dr. Franklin had paid me nine months' salary a 
few days before your letters arrived, and too great a part 
of it was pre-engaged to admit of my repaying it and wait- 
ing for bills. 

I must request the favour of you to pay twenty pounds 
York money to Miss Kitty Livingston on account of my 
little boy, and one hundred and fifty pounds like money to 
Frederick, Peter, and Nancy, — to each fifty pounds. Ar- 
range this through Mr. Benson. I hear my father has 
given some of the servants free, and that some other of the 
older ones have been put out. Old servants are sometimes 
neglected. Desire Mr. Benson to keep an eye over them, 
and not let any of them want ; and for that purpose, place 
fifty pounds in his hands, which he will apply according to 
his discretion, as necessity may, from time to time, require. 
He must also reimburse himself for any expenses he may 
be at on this account. I should write to him also on this 
subject, but have neither health nor time, having at present 
a violent headache and a little fever, and my letter must be 
sent to the Marquis de La Fayette's this evening. Adieu, 

my friend. 

Yours, &c. 

John Jay,

TO ROBERT MORRIS. 

Paris, 13th October, 1782. 
v Dear Sir, 

Wherever and however occupied, I rememher my friends, 
and always find my own satisfaction promoted when I have 
reason to think that I am conducing to theirs. This has 
led me to make your sons the subject of this letter. It is 
an interesting one to you, and therefore not indifferent 
to me. 

On my arrival here, I found them placed in a. pension at 
Passy. My daughter was ill with a whooping-cough, and, 
lest your sons should catch it, we denied ourselves the plea- 
sure of having them with us until after that obstacle had 
ceased. I have frequently seen them at Dr. Franklin's, as 
well as at my own house. They had promised to dine with 
us every Wednesday, but Mr. Ridley prolonged it to every 
other Wednesday. They are fine boys, and appear to pos- 
sess a full share of natural talents. I am told that they- 
have made a progress in French proportionate to the time 
they have been learning it. Of this I am not an adequate 
judge myself, and therefore must depend on the judgment 
of others. The pension at which they are has been so far 
well enough; but I think, with Mr. Ridley, that a better is 
to be wished for, and to be sought. He is at present 
making the necessary inquiries, and I have every reason to 
believe that the trust you have reposed in him will be con- 
scientiously and faithfully executed. 

Mr. Ridley finds it difficult to decide on the expediency 
of carrying them to Geneva ; and, from what 1 have heard, 
I think he has reason to entertain doubts on that head. As 
I have no materials to judge from but the report of others, 
and those perhaps not altogether well-founded, it is diffi- 
cult for me to form a decided opinion on the subject. I 
can only say, that I have heard more against it than for it. 

My opinion may perhaps seem singular, and the more so 



104 LIFE OF JOH.N JAY. 

as it cannot be properly explained in the compass of a letter. 
I think the youth of every free civilized country should, if 
possible, be educated in it, and not permitted to travel out 
of it till age has made them so cool and firm as to retain 
their national and moral impressions. Connexions formed 
at school and college have much influence, and are to be 
watched even at that period. If judiciously formed, they 
will often endure and be advantageous through life. Ameri- 
can youth may possibly form proper, and perhaps useful, 
friendships in European seminaries, but I think not so prob- 
ably as among their fellow-citizens, with whom they arc to 
grow up, whom it will be useful for them to know and be 
early known to, and with whom they are to be engaged in 
the business of active life, and under the eve and direction 
of parents whose advice, authority, and example are fre- 
quently of more worth than the lessons of hireling pro- 
fessors, particularly on the subjects of religion, morality, 
virtue, and prudence. 

The fine, and some of the useful, arts may doubtless be 
better acquired in Europe than America, and so may the 
living European languages ; but when I consider that a 
competent knowledge even of these may be gained in our 
countrv, and that almost all of the more substantial and 
truly valuable acquirements may, in my opinion, with more 
facilitv and certainty be attained there than here, I do not 
hesitate to prefer an American education. 

I fear that the ideas which my countrymen in general 
conceive of Europe are in many respects rather too high. 
If we should ever meet again, you shall know my sentiments 
very fully on that head. 

But your sons are here, and what is to be done ? !Mr. 
Ridley is about doing what I think, with him, is the best 
thincr that can at present be done, viz. to put them in one 
of the best pensions that can be found, and to give them 
the advantage of such extra tutors as may be requisite. 

Perhaps further information may place Geneva in a more 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 105 

favourable light. You shall have frequent letters from me 
on this subject ; and while I remain here, you may be 
assured of my constant attentions to these promising boys. 

I am, dear sir, 
With great esteem and regard, 

Your affectionate friend and servant, 

John Jay. 

to gouverneur morris. 

Paris, 13th Oct., 1792. 

Dear Morris, 

I have received your festina Jente letter, but wish it had 
been at least partly in cipher ; you need not be informed of 
my reasons for the wish, as by this time you must know 
that seals are, on this side of the water, rather matters of 
decoration than of use It gave me nevertheless great 
pleasure to receive that letter, it being the first from you 
that had reached me, the Lord knows when. I find you 
are industrious, and of consequence, useful ; so much the 
better for yourself, for the public, and for our friend Morris, 
whom I consider as the pillar of American credit. 

The king of Great Britain, by letters patent under the 
great seal, has authorized Mr. Oswald to treat with the 
commissioners of the United States of America. His first 
commission literally pursued the enabling act, and the au- 
thority it gave him was expressed in the very terms of that 
act, viz. to treat with the colonies, and with any or either 
of them, and any part of them, and with any description of 
men in them, and with any person whatsoever, of and con- 
cerning peace, &c. 

Had I not violated the instructions of Congress, their 
dignity would have been in the dust ; for the French min- 
ister even took pains, not only to persuade us to treat under 
that commission, but to prevent the second, by telling Fitz- 
herbert that the first was sufficient. I told the minister that 

vol. n. — o 



106 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

we neither could nor would treat with any nation in the 
world on any other than on an equal footing. 

We may and we may not have a peace this winter. 
Act as if the war would certainly continue. Keep proper 
garrisons in your strong posts ; and preserve your army 
sufficiently numerous, and well appointed, until every idea 
of hostility and surprise shall have completely vanished. 

I could write you a volume, but my health admits only 
of short intervals of application. 

Present my best wishes to Mr. and Mrs. Morris, and 
such other of our friends as may ask how we do. 

I am, dear Morris, 

Very much your friend, 

John Jay. 

from george washington. 

Yerplanck's Point (on the Hudson), ) 
18th Oct., 1782. $ 

Dear Sir, 

Not having received from your excellency, during the 
last winter or summer, the acknowledgment of any letter, 
except of my public despatches of October last, I appre- 
hend that some private letters, which I have had the plea- 
sure of addressing to you since that time, have miscarried. 
I resume my pen, therefore, to repeat the thanks which 
were contained in one of them, for the wine you had the 
goodness to present me with ; and to assure you that I en- 
tertain the friendly sentiments towards you which I have 
ever experienced since our first acquaintance. 

We have now passed another campaign, and no very 
important occurrence has intervened on this side the Atlan- 
tic. The evacuation of Charleston was considered by 
General Greene, in his last letters to me, as an event that 
would certainly take place ; and from other circumstances 
I am induced to believe it is effected by this time. Part of 
the garrison (the British troops) will probably go to the 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENT 1 . L07 

West Indies, and the Germans to the northward. Admiral 
Pigot is now in New- York harbour, with twenty-six heavy 
ships, ready wooded and watered for sea ; but the present 
circumstances, though somewhat equivocal, do not indicate 
that New-York will be abandoned this year ; notwithstand- 
ing there have been many reports and conjectures of the 
kind some weeks acm. 

The Marquis De Vaudruille is in Boston harbour with 
twelve sail of the line (three excepted, which are at 
Portsmouth), having unfortunately stranded and lost the 
Magnifique on entering that bay. But Congress have pre- 
sented to his most Christian Majesty the ship America, of 
74 guns, built at Portsmouth, and now nearly fit for sea. 

The changes in the British ministry, and the fluctuation 
of their councils, are the subjects of universal speculation, 
We wait with impatience to hear the result of the negotia- 
tions, and not being very sanguine in our expectations, 
endeavour to hold ourselves prepared for every contin- 
gency. I am certain it will afford you pleasure to know 
that our army is better organized, disciplined, and clothed, 
than it has been at any period since the commencement of 
the war. This you may be assured is the fact. 

I shall always be happy to hear from you, especially at 
the present important crisis of European politics ; and beg 
you will be persuaded, that with the warmest wishes and 
most respectful compliments to Mrs. Jay, I am, with senti- 
ments of the highest regard and esteem, 

Dear sir, your excellencv's most obedient 
And humble servant, 

Geo. Washington. 

to lady juliana penn. 

Paris, 4th Dec, 1782. 

I shall always be exceedingly happy, my lad_\'. in every 
opportunity of confirming the favourable opinion with 
which your ladyship and the amiable friend to whom I 



108 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

believe you allude, have been impressed. The misfortunes 
incident to war are always to be regretted, and humanity 
will not cease to sympathize with those on either side, who, 
without deserving, have experienced its rigours. 

It gives me pleasure to inform your ladyship, that accord- 
ing to the preliminaries agreed to between Great Britain 
and America, Congress will recommend in a very benevo- 
lent manner to the reconsideration of the different States, 
the measures they have taken against certain individuals. 
The nature of our government rendered every other mode 
of revising those cases improper ; and as some persons 
might have much, others little, and many no reason to com- 
plain, ft was the most eligible and obvious mode of ascer- 
taining the merits of each ; there is also reason to expect 
that whatever undue degrees of severity may have been 
infused into our laws by a merciless war, and a strong 
sense of injuries, will yield to the influence of those gentler 
emotions, which the mild and cheerful season of peace and 
tranquillity must naturally excite. 

Your ladyship will, therefore, see the necessity as well 
as propriety of applying after the war, to the Legislature 
of Pennsylvania, for a reconsideration of the act respecting 
your family. For my part, I believe that justice will be 
done to all ; and I hope that clemency and reconciliation 
will be refused only to the faithless and the cruel. The 
same magnanimity which has distinguished the conduct of 
America in times of danger and distress, will doubtless 
enable her to receive prosperity with dignity and gratitude, 
and to use it with moderation and philanthropy. 
I have the honour to be, with perfect respect, 
Your ladyship's 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 

John Jay. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDED I.. 10^ 



TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Paris, 14th December, 1782. 

Dear Sir, 

From our preliminaries and the king's speech, the present 
disposition and system of the British court may, in my 
opinion, be collected. Although particular circumstances 
constrained them to yield us more than perhaps they 
wished, I still think they meant to make (what they thought 
would really be) a satisfactory peace with us. In the con- 
tinuance of this disposition and system too much confidence 
ought not to be placed, for disappointed violence and mor- 
tified ambition are certainly dangerous foundations to build 
implicit confidence upon ; but I cannot forbear thinking 
that we ought not, in the common phrase, to throw cold 
water upon it by improper exultation, extravagant demands, 
or illiberal publications ; should such a temper appear, it 
would be wise to discountenance it. It is our policy to be 
independent in the most extrusive sense, and to observe a 
proper distance towards all nations, minding our own busi- 
ness, and not interfering with, or being influenced bv, the 
views of any, further than they may respect us. 

Some of my colleagues flatter themselves with the proba- 
bility of obtaining compensation for damages. I have no 
objections to a further trial, but I confess I doubt its suc- 
cess, for Britain has no money to spare, and will think the 
confiscations should settle that account, for thev do not 
expect that retribution will be made to all. 

Our affairs have a very promising aspect, and a little 
prudence will secure us all that we can reasonably expect. 
The boundaries between the States should be immediately 
settled, and all causes of discord between them removed. 
It would be imprudent to disband the army while a foreign 
one remains in the country; and it would be equally un- 
wise to permit Americans to spill the blood of our friends 
in the islands, for in all of them there are many who wish

us well. The sale of the continental lands would, if prop- 
erly regulated and appropriated to that purpose, form a 
fund on which we might borrow money, especially if 
foreigners could see good reason to rely on our good faith, 
which, by being in certain instances violated, has lost much 
of its credit. I allude particularly to the interest on loan- 
office certificates, and the publications in our papers on that 
subject, which do us harm in Europe. Adieu. 

I am, dear Robert, 

Your friend,

Philadelphia, January 3d, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 

You have not heard from me so often as you had a right 
to expect. I lament, but cannot help it. Constant employ- 
ment puts it out of my power to do many things I wish to 
do, and that of writing to my friends is among the number. 
My private letters, however, cannot be of much conse- 
quence, and you must accept the will for the deed. 

I cannot take time at present to enter on any political 
discussions. But you must allow me to declare my perfect 
satisfaction in, and approbation of, your conduct in Europe. 
All who have had the opportunity of knowing what it has 
been, are struck with admiration at your patience under 
difficulties, and your firmness in rising superior to them. 
Go on, my friend ; you deserve and will receive the grati- 
tude of your country. History will hand down your plaudit 
to posterity. The men of the present day, who are gene- 
rally least grateful to their contemporaries, esteem it an 
honour to be of your acquaintance.

Your friend Gouverneur writes you political letters, bu^

how industrious, how useful he is ; his talents and abilities 
you know ; they are all faithfully and disinterestedly 
applied to the service of his country. I could do nothing 
without him, and our joint labours do but just keep the 
wheels in motion. 

With sincere attachment,

to marquis de la fayette. 

Rouen, 19th Jan., 1783. 
Dear Sir, 

Accept my thanks for your obliging letter of the 26th 
December last, which the marchioness was so kind as to 
send me yesterday. I congratulate you on your safe arri- 
val at Cadiz, and you have my best wishes, that the same 
good fortune you have hitherto experienced, may continue 
to attend you. 

The state of my health making a change of air and exer- 
cise advisable, I left Paris ten days ago on an excursion 
into Normandy. Hence, I suppose, it has happened that 
I have neither heard of nor seen your letters to Dr. 
Franklin. 

If I am not mistaken, a copy of the American prelimina- 
ries has been sent to Spain ; and I flatter myself that Count 
de Montmorin will think them perfectly consistent with our 
engagements to our allies. It appears to me singular that 
any doubts should be entertained of American good faith ; 
for as it has been tried and remains inviolate, they cannot 
easily be explained on principles honourable to those who 
entertain them. America has so often repeated and reite- 



112 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

rated her professions and assurances of regard to the treaty 
alluded to, that I hope she will not impair her dignity by 
making any more of them ; but leave the continued upright- 
ness of her conduct to inspire that confidence which it 
seems she does not yet possess, although she has always 
merited. 

Our warmest acknowledgments are due to you for the 
zeal you manifest to serve America, at all times and in all 
places ; but, sir, I have little expectation that your plan of 
a Spanish loan will succeed. I confess that I am far from 
being anxious about it. In my opinion, America can, with 
no propriety, accept favours from Spain. 

My absence from Paris has deprived me of the means of 
information, and therefore I cannot at present gratify either 
your wishes or my own on that head. God knows whether 
or not we shall have peace. A variety of contradictory 
reports daily reach me, but they deserve little credit. It 
is again said, that Charleston is evacuated — that may be. 
It is also said, the enemy have left New-York ; but I ad- 
here to my former opinion, and do not believe a word of it. 
Mrs. Jay writes me that Mr. Oswald is gone to London, 
but for what purpose I am ignorant. Thus, my dear sir, 
are we held in a state of suspense, which nothing but time 
can remove. I purpose to return next week to Paris, and 
shall then write to you again. Adieu.

Paris, 22d Feb., 1783. 

Sir, 

Your letter of the 10th inst. was delivered to me a few 
davs ago. 

The reason to which you ascribe my not having answered 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE.- 113 

the other you wrote me was the true one, viz. that it was 
unnecessary. 

The time has been, when my writing to you would not 
have depended on such a circumstance, for you arc not 
mistaken in supposing that I was once your friend. I really 
was, and should still have been so, had you not advised 
Americans to desert that independence, which they had 
pledged to each other, their lives, their fortunes, and their 
sacred honour to support. 

The charges against you of peculation undoubtedly called 
for strict and speedy inquiry ; but I expected that you 
would make a satisfactory defence against them. I hope 
so still. 

I will write to Congress about your accounts as you de- 
sire. Justice certainly demands that they should be liqui- 
dated and settled. 

Dr. Bancroft, some time ago, asked my opinion as to 
your going to England. I told him it would be imprudent, 
but not that "it would be taken ill." To my knowledge, 
you was and are suspected of being in the British interest. 
Such a step would have strengthened that suspicion, and at 
that interesting period would have countenanced harsh 
conjectures as to the motives and objects of your journey, 
which for my part I could not divine. Perhaps the suspi- 
cion I mention is new to you ; if so, the information is 
important. 

Before this will come to your hands, and you could after- 
ward get to London, the above mentioned objections will 
be weakened ; and as circumstances press your going, it is 
probable you will venture. Let me advise you to be pru- 
dent, and to be cautious what company you keep, and what 
conversation you hold in that country. 

I* write thus plainly and fully, because I still indulge an 
idea, that your head mav have been more to blame than 
your heart; and that in some melancholy desponding hour, 
the disorder of your nerves infected your opinions and your

pen. God grant that this may prove to have been the

opinion, that you was a valuable, a virtuous, and a patriotic 
man. Whenever this may happen, I will, with great and 
sincere satisfaction, again become 

Your friend,

to benjamin vaughan, esq. 

Paris, 28th March, 1783, 

Dear Sir, 

Whence came the idea, that the moment a minister loses 
a question in parliament, he must be displaced ? That kings 
should adopt such a maxim is not very unnatural, but that 
a free parliament should think an influential dictator < 
them necessary to the government of the kingdom, seems 
rather a new opinion. Perhaps it arose gradually from the 
practices of the court and the decay of public virtue during 
the last hundred years. 

So far as the peace respects France and America, I am 
persuaded it was wise in Britain to conclude it. The 
cessions to France are not, in my opinion, extravagant ; 
and the terms settled with America, m removing all causes 
of future variance, certainly load to conciliation and friend- 
ship. 

It appears to me that the discussion of this subject might 
have been more ample and satisfactory. Why was not 
parliament told of our offer i rce, and the mu- 

tual navigation of the American waters? The word ; 
procity would not then have been deemed so nug 

We have received particular instructions on the business 
of commerce, and Mr. Fitzherbert has been informed of our 
readiness to add to th< isional treaty, an article for 

opening and regulating the trade between us on principles 
as liberal and reciprocal as you please. What more can 
be said or done ? Mr. Pitt's bill was a good one, a wise

one, and one that will for ever do honour to the extent and 
policy of his views, and to those of the administration 
undcrwho.se auspices it was formed. For my own part, 
however, 1 think that. America need not be exceedingly 
anxious about the matter; for it will be in our power to 
derive from a navigation act of our own, full as many 
advantages as we should lose by the restrictions of your 
laws. 

The objections drawn from your treaties with Russia, 
&c. appear to me weak, and have been answered; but 
why not give them similar terms on similar conditions ? 
They furnish you with raw materials chiefly, and you them 
with manufactures only. The gain, therefore, must be 
yours. With respect to carriage and navigation, they stand 
in a very different predicament from us. 

As to the tories who have received damage from us, why 
so much noise about them, and so little said or thought of 
;s who have suffered ten times as much from these same 
tories, not to mention the desolations of an unjust and licen- 
tious war. 

We forget our sufferings, and even agree to recommend 
to favour a set of men, of whoi i very few would consider 
the having their deserts in the light of a blessing. How 
does reciprocity stand in this account ? 

Some, it seems, think that New- York should be retained 
as a rod to drive us on in this business of the tories. Strange 
that the idea of driving us should still be entertained. I 
pledge myself to you that, should such a design be adopted 
and become apparent, the refugees will get nothing, and the 
progress of reconciliation will be as slow as the warmest 
Gallican could wish. 

I hear there is to be a Congress here ; that is, that Britain 

and France have requested the two imperial courts to send 

mediatorial ambassadors here for the purpose of being 

witnesses to the execution of the definitive treaties ; — a very 

•rtant errand, no doubt, and very complimentary to 



116 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

those sovereigns. Is it probable that a Congress should be 
called for that poor, single, simple purpose ? Why your 
court agreed to it is hard to conceive. 

I have written to my countrymen, that Lord Shelburne's 
system respecting them appeared to me to be liberal and 
conciliatory, but that his hesitations about avowing the 
acknowledgment of our independence discouraged exten- 
sive confidence without further facts. I always think it 
best to be candid and explicit. I hope we shall soon be in 
the full possession of our country and of peace, and as we 
expect to have no further cause of quarrel with Great 
Britain, we can have no inducement to wish or to do her 
injury ; on the contrary, we may become as sensible to her 
future good offices as we have been to her former evil 
ones. A little good-natured wisdom often does more in 
politics than much slippery craft. By the former, the French 
acquired the esteem and gratitude of America, and by the 
latter, their minister is impairing it. 

Thus I have written you a hasty letter. Since the 
receipt of yours, until this moment, I have been promising 
myself the pleasure of paying you a visit. I now find it 
probable that I shall be detained here some time longer. 

Mrs. Jay charges me to say civil things to you. You are 
a favourite of hers, and deserve to be so of everybody. 
Our little girl is well, and when able to speak, shall be taught 
to send you her compliments. I shall reply to certain parts 
of your letter in my next ; at present, I am pressed for 
time. I must not, however, forget my worthy friend, Mr. 
Oswald. He deserves well of his country, and posterity 
will not only approve, but commend his conduct. Assure 
him of my esteem and attachment, and believe me to be, 
with the best wishes for the health and happiness of Mrs. 
Vaughan and your little daughter, 

Dear sir, 
Your sincere and affectionate friend, 

John Jay.

TO ROBERT MORRIS. 

Paris, 8th April, 178:}. 
Dear Sir, 
Permil me to introduce to you a gentleman who is going 
to help you to pay tuxes, and to participate in the liberties 
which render them necessary, viz. Mr. Joshua Grigley. 
Mr. 13. Vaughan u rites me that this gentleman has consid- 
erable property, which you know will qualify him for the 
iirst, and that he has also much virtue and merit, which will 
enable him to sustain, as well as to enjoy, the latter. Thus, 
you see, he will be an addition to our collective property 
and respectability, and, consequently, comes naturally within 
your two departments of financier and patriot. 

But you have also another department to which I must 
take the liberty of recommending this gentleman. He is a 
friend of Mr. Vaughan — he is a gentleman — he is a stranger 
— he is young. I know you too well to enlarge, or to add 
any thing except an assurance, with which I could, with as 
little hesitation, conclude my days as my letter, viz. that I 
am, with great esteem and atlectionate regard, 

Dear sir, your friend and servant,

to francis child.* 

Paris, 11th May, 1783. 
Dear Frank, 
Your letter of the 1st of January last was delivered to 
me yesterday, and gives me pleasure. You do well to look 
forward to the means of exercising your profession to 
advantage. You shall continue to have my aid and pro- 
tection, in such measure and season, as circumstances may 
render proper and expedient. 

Mr. Francis Child was an indigent boy, who had been educated at Mr. 
Jay's expense. The press mentioned in this letter was obtained, and on it 
Mr. Child printed the first daily newspaper published in the city of New- 
York after the revolution. 



3 18 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

You belong to a large and helpless family, and I wish to 
see you as able, as I hope you would be willing, to provide 
for them. 

I think with you, that on the evacuation of New-York, 
you may set up a press there with a good prospect of suc- 
cess. On speaking to Dr. Franklin yesterday about it, he 
told me that when the enemy left Philadelphia, they carried 
from thence to New- York, a printing-press of his, and that 
it is now in the possession of one Robinson, a printer, at 
New-York. As by the provisional treaty the British forces 
are not to carry away any effects of the inhabitants, this 
press may perhaps be recovered. The Dr. has desired me 
to prepare a letter of attorney for the purpose, to some per- 
son in New-York, and in case it should be restored, will 
lend it to you. I shall immediately think of furnishing you 
with some types, and Dr. Franklin has promised his assist- 
ance, so that you may soon expect to hear from me again 
about these matters. In the mean time, write a letter of 
thanks t<> the Dr. for his kind attention. 

I must remind you that you should extend your applica- 
tion beyond the mere mechanical [-art of your business. 
You will have to compose as well as to print, and you 
should take pains not only to store your mind with useful 
knowledge, but also to acquire the talent of writing in a 
clear, concise, and accurate style. Remember too, that an 
acquaintance with accounts, and the method of keeping 
them, is not to be neglected. It is important to all men, 
and particularly to those who cannot afford to be careless. 
If you are industrious, prudent, and punctual in the conduct 
of your business, you will most certainly succeed ; and my 
desire of helping you, instead of abating, will be increased 
by your endeavours to help yourself. 

I am, with sincere regard, dear Frank, 

Your friend and servant, 

John Jay.

Passy, 13th June, 1783. 
My Dear Sir. 
I have, within these few days past, road and admired 
your address to the army, and their proceedings in conse- 
quence of it. Such instances of patriotism are rare, and 
America must find it difficult to express, in adequate terms, 
the gratitude she owes to both. Such a degree of glory » 
so virtuously acquired, and so decently sustained, is as 
new as our political constellation, and. will for ever give 
lustre to it. May every blessing be yours. 

Mr. Hartley has just informed me that orders have been 
sent to the British commander-in-chief to evacuate the 
United States. Our attention will then, I hope, be turned 
to the preservation and improvement of what we have 
gained; and a sense of the importance of that task leads 
me to wish that the execution of it may be facilitated by 
your counsels and applicatio

Dear Madam, 

I have long been accustomed to hear, and I might add 
read, so much in which the heart has no concern, that the 
few letters like yours which reach me, arc particularly 
welcome. 

The peace appears to me, as it does to you, to be season- 
able as well as advantageous; and I sincere]}' join with 
you in ascribing that and every other of our b] s to 

the Supreme Author of all the good that ever was and

120 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

As your letter is of the 12th April, and as I have re- 
ceived others dated late in May, which mention nothing of 
my sister, I indulge some little hope that she is still alive ; 
if so, I shall be very thankful ; if not, God's will be done. 
To her, this world has not been a paradise. Her leaving it 
will be a misfortune to the few who knew her worth, and 
to whom she was attached. She will have reason to re- 
joice in the change. I feel most sensibly for the effect it 
would have on my brother; it would double the pressure 
of all his afflictions. God grant him resignation, and per- 
mit me to return soon to comfort him. He has every right 
to expect it from me, and if my life be spared, he shall not 
be disappointed. I cannot proceed. 

God bless you, my dear madam ;

Passy, 17th July, 1783. 
Dear Morris, 

By this time, I suppose there is much canvassing for 
foreign appointments. I thank you for thinking of me, but 
as I mean to return in the spring, your arrangements, so 
far as respects me, must be altered. Upon this point I am 
decided, and beg of you to tell my friends so. 

Orders are gone to evacuate New- York. The present 
British ministry are duped, I believe, by an opinion of our 
not having decision and energy sufficient to regulate our 
trade, so as to retaliate their restrictions. Our ports were 
opened too soon. Let us, however, be temperate as well 
as firm. 

Our friend Morris, I suspect, is not a favourite of this 
court. They say, he treats them as his cashier. They 
refuse absolutely to supply more money. Marbois writes 
tittle-tattle, and I believe does mischief. Congress cer- 
tainly should remove to some interior town, and they

should send a minister forthwith to England. The French 
ambassador at Petersburg has thrown cold water on 
Dana's being received before a pi ace. 

The ministers of this court are qualified to act the part 
of Proteus. The nation, I think, is with us, and the king 
seems to be well disposed. Adieu.

to governor livingston. 

Passy, L9th July, 1783. 
Dear Sir, 

On the 1st instant, I had the pleasure of receiving your 
favour of the 21st May hist. 

I am happy to hear that the provisional articles meet 
with general approbation. The tories will doubtless cause 
some difficulty, bul thai they have always done, and as this 
will probably be the hist time, we musl m; : best of it. 
A universal indiscriminate condemnation and expulsion of 
those people, would not r< dound to our honour, because so 
harsh a measure would partake more of vengeance than of 
justice. For my part, I wish that all except the faith 
and the cruel may be forgiven. That exception would 
indeed extend to very few ; but even if it applied to the 
case of one only, that one ought, in my opinion, to be 
saved. 

The reluctance with which the States in general pay the 
necessary taxes, is much to be regretted ; it injures both 
their reputation and interest abroad, as well as at home, 
and tends to cherish the hopes and speculations of those 
who wish we may become and remain an unimportant, 
divided people. The rising power of America is a serious 
object of apprehension to more than one nation, and every 
event that may retard it will be agreeable to them. A 
continental, national spirit should therefore pervade our 
country, and Congress should be enabled, by a grant of the

necessary powers, to regulate the commerce and general 
concerns of the confederacy ; and we should remember 
that to be constantly prepared for war, is the only way to 
have peace. The Swiss on the one hand, and the Dutch 
on the other, bear testimony to the truth of this remark. 

The general and the army have, by their late moderation, 
done themselves infinite honour ; and it is to be hoped that 
the States will not only be just, but generous to those brave 
and virtuous citizens. America is at present held in a very 
respectable point of view, but as the eyes of the world are 
upon her, the continuance of that consideration will depend 
on the dignity and wisdom of her conduct. 

I mean to return next spring. My health is somewhat 
better.

Philadelphia, 25th July, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 

Though I have not performed my promise of writing to 
you, which I made you when you left this country, yet I 
have not the less interested myself in your welfare and 
success. I have been witness with pleasure to every event 
which has had a tendency to advance you in the esteem of 
your country ; and I may assure you with sincerity that it 
is as high as you could possibly wish. All have united in 
the warmest approbation of your conduct. I cannot 
forbear telling you this, because my situation has given 
me access to the truth, and I gratify my friendship for you 
in communicating what cannot fail to gratify your sen- 
sibility. 

The peace, which exceeds in the goodness of its terms 
the expectations of the most sanguine, does the highest 
honour to those who made it. It is the more agreeable as

the time was come when thinking men began to be seriously 
alarmed at the internal embarrassments and exhausted stair 
of this country. The New-England people talk of making 
you an animal fish-offering, as an acknowledgment of your 
exertions for the participation of the fisheries. 

We have now happily concluded the greal work of 
independence, but much remains to he done to reap the 
fruits of it. Our prospects are not fla Everyday 

proves the inefficacy of the present leration, ; el the 

common danger being removed, we are receding instead 
of advancing in a disposition to amend its defects. The 
road to popularity in each State is to inspire jealousies of 
the power of Congress, though nothing can be more appa- 
rent than that they have no power ; and that for the want 
of it, the resources of the country during the war could 
not be drawn out, and we at this moment experience all 
the mischiefs of a bankrupt and ruined credit. It is to be 
hoped that when prejudice and folly have run themselves 
out of breath, we may return to reason and correct our 
errors. 

After having served in the field during the war, I have 
been making a short apprenticeship in Congress ; but the 
evacuation of New-York approaching, I am preparing to 
take leave of public life, to enter into the practice of the 
law. Your country will continue to demand your services 
abroad. I beg you to present me most respectfully to Mrs. 
Jay, and to be assured of the affection and esteem of,

TO ROBERT MORRIS. 

Passy, 20th July, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 
By Capt. Barney I was favoured with yours of the 31st 
May. By this time T hope you will have received several 
letters from me, which were then on the way. Want of 
health has long made much writing painful to me, so that 
my letters in general are short. 

My jaunt to Normandy did me some service, but less 
than I expected. The pare air of this place has been use- 
ful to me. The pain in my breast has abated, and I have 
had no fever since 1 came here, which was about six weeks 
ago. 

Gouverneur is happy in your esteem; it adds to mine 
for him. I have Ions been attached to him, and sincerely 
wish that our friendship, instead of being diminished, may 
continue to erain strength with time. 

Your intended resignation alarmed me, and would have 
been followed with ill consequences to our affairs. I rejoice 
that you continue in office, and by no means regret that it 
will be less in your power than inclination to retire soon. 
I am well aware of the difficulties you will continue to ex- 
perience. Everyman so circumstanced must expect them. 
Your office is neither an easy nor a pleasant one to execute, 
but it is elevated and important, and therefore envy, with 
her inseparable companion injustice, will not cease to plague 
you. Remember, however, that triumphs do not precede 
victory, and that victory is seldom found in the smooth 
paths of peace and tranquillity. Your enemies would be 
happy to drive you to resign, and in my opinion both your 
interest and that of your country oppose your gratifying 
them. You have health, fortune, talents, and fortitude, and 
you have children too. Each of these circumstances re- 
commend perseverance. 

As to money this court will afford you no further sup-

plies. The minister has said, it was easy to be a financier 
and draw bills, when others provided the funds to pay them, 
At another time, he intimated that his court was not treated 
with a proper degree of delicacy on thai subject, and said, 
"that you treated them as your cashiers." A French 
officer from America, who is a friend ofyours, told me that 
La Luzerne and Marbois were not pleased with the man- 
ner of your applications to them about money matters. I 
mention these facts, because it may be useful for you to 
know them. 

The loan in Holland goes on, and from that quarter your 
bills must lie saved, if at all. Mr. Adams sot out for Am- 
sterdam the day before yesterday, and will push on that 
business. If the Dutch began to draw benefit from our 
trade, they would lend more cheerfully. 

The British ministry have not yet authorized Mr. Hartley 
to consent to any thing as to commerce. They amuse him 
and us, and deceive themselves. I told him yesterday that 
they would find us like a globe ; not to be overset. They 
wish to be the only carriers between their islands and other 
countries; and though they are apprized of our right to 
regulate our trade as we please, yet I suspect they flatter 
themselves that the different States possess too little of a 
national or continental spirit, ever to agree in any one 
national system. I think they will find themselves mis- 
taken. 

Believe me to be, dear sir,

from benjamin franklin. 

Passy, Sept. I Oth, 1783. 
Sir, 

I have received a letter from a very respectable person 
in America, containing the following words, viz : — 



126 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

" It is confidently reported, propagated, and believed by 
some among us, that the Court of France was at bottom 
against our obtaining the fishery and territory, in that great 
extent in which both are secured to us by the treaty ; that 
our minister at that court favoured, or did not oppose, this 
design against us ; and that it was entirely owing to the 
firmness, sagacity, and disinterestedness of Mr. Adams, 
with whom Mr. Jay united, that we have obtained those 
important advantages." 

It is not my purpose to dispute any share of the honour 
of that treaty, which the friends of my colleagues may be 
disposed to give them ; but having now spent fifty years of 
my life in public offices and trusts, and having still one am- 
bition left, that of carrying the character of fidelity, at least, 
to the grave with me, I cannot allow that I was behind any 
of them in zeal and faithfulness. I therefore think that I 
ought not to suffer an accusation, which falls little short of 
treason to my country, to pass without notice, when the 
means of effectual vindication arc at hand. You, sir, was 
a witness of my conduct in that allair. To you and my 
other colleagues I appeal, by sending to each a similar letter 
with this ; and I have no doubt of your readiness to do a 
brother-commissioner justice, by certificates that will en- 
tirely destroy the effect of that accusation. I have the 
honour to be, with much esteem, 

Sir, your most obedient, 

And most humble servant, 

B. Franklin.

Passy, 11th Sept., 1783. 
Sir, 
I have been favoured with your letter of yesterday, and 
will answer it explicitly. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDED E. l'J7 

I have no reason whatever to believe that you was 
averse to our obtaining the lull extent of boundary and 
fisher}- secured to us by the treaty. Your conduct respect- 
ing them throughout the negotiation indicated a strong and 
a ste;id_\- attachment to both these objects, and in my 
opinion, promoted the attainment of them. 

I remember that in a conversation which Mr. de Rayne- 
val, the first secretary of Count de Vergennes, had with 
you and me, in the summer of 1782, you contended for 
our full right to the fishery, and argued it on various 
principles. 

lour letters to me, when in Spain, considered our terri- 
tory as extending to the Mississippi, and expressed your 
opinion against ceding the navigation of that river in very 
strong and pointed terms. 

In short, sir, I do not recollect the least difference in sen- 
timent between us respecting the boundaries or fisheries ; 
on the contrary, we were unanimous and united in ad- 
hering to and insisting on them. nor did I ever perceive the 
least disposition in either of us to recede from our claims, 
or be satisfied with less than we obtained. 

I have the honour to be, with great respect and esteem,

Dear Robert, 
At your farm with your family, in peace, and in plenty, 
how happy is your situation! I wish you may not have 
retired too soon. It is certain you may do much good 
where you are. and perhaps in few things more than in im- 
pressing by precept, influence, and example, the indispensa- 
ble necessity of rendering the continental and State govern- 
ments vigorous and orderly. 



128 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

Europe hears much, and wishes to hear more of divisions, 
seditions, violences, and confusions among us. The tories 
are generally and greatly pitied, more indeed than they de- 
serve. The indiscriminate expulsion and ruin of that whole 
class and description of men, would not do honour to our 
magnanimity or humanity, especially in the opinion of those 
nations who consider with more astonishment than pleasure 
the terms of peace which America has obtained. General 
Washington's letter does him credit as a soldier, patriot, 
and Christian. I wish his advice may meet with the 
attention it merits. 

Mr. Hartley is gone to London, and expects soon to re- 
turn and resume the discussion of commercial regulations, 
&c. He has assured us officially, that Britain is not re- 
solved to adhere to the line marked out in their proclama- 
tion respecting the West India trade. I doubt their 
knowing themselves what tiny mean to do. In my opinion, 
we should adhere to exact reciprocity with all nations, and 
were we well united, they would yield to it. He assured 
us, also, that orders were gi ne lbr the evacuation of New- 
York. 

We have had much cool weather lately, and I find my- 
self the better lor it. All the people are running after air- 
globes. The invention of them may have many conse- 
quences, and who knows but travellers may hereafter liter- 
ally pass from country to country on the wings of the 
wind. 

Assure vour good family of our sincere regard, and be- 
lieve me to be, dear Robert, 

Your affectionate friend,

TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Passy, 16th Sept., 1783. 
Dear Sir, 

The day before yesterday I was favoured with your 
friendly letter of 1st July. . 

To whatever cause the suspension of our correspondence 
may have been owing, I am persuaded that it did not 
originate cither with you or with me. How far my con- 
jectures on that subject may be well founded, will be ascer- 
tained when we meet. 

Had your reason for retiring been less urgent than that of 
ill health, I should have thought it premature. While gov- 
ernment remains relaxed, and the laws have yet to acquire 
a due degree of respect and obedience, men of talents, 
weight, and influence should exert themselves to establish 
and maintain constitutional authority and subordination. 

No less wisdom and perseverance is necessary to pre- 
serve and secure what we have gained, than were requisite 
in the acquisition ; and experience informs us that internal 
commotions and confusion are as injurious to the peace and 
happiness of society, as war and enemies from abroad. 
Well-ordered government is essential to the duration and 
enjoyment of the tranquillity and leisure you promise your- 
self at Saratoga, and therefore domestic as well as public 
considerations call upon you for such a degree of attention 
to these subjects as your health will admit of. 

I hope and expect next summer to return. Not only my 
family and my private concerns require it, but also the 
principles which led me into public life. But if, on my 
return, I find it my duty to devote more of my time to the 
public, they shall have it, though retirement is what I 
ardently desire. 

I am not surprised that men of certain characters should 
censure the terms of peace. There are men who view 

VOL. II. R

subjects only on the dark side ; there are others who find 
fault to show their discernment ; and we meet with some 
whose opinions are wholly decided by ideas of convenience 
and personal politics. I am happy, however, to hear that 
the great majority are content. In the opinion of Europe, 
they have great reason to be so. 

Your affectionate and very humble servant, 

John Jay, 



TO GOUVEKINEUR MORRIS. 

Passy, 24th September, 1783. 

Dear Morris, 

The sight of your friendly letter of the 25th of July last, 
and of those it recommends, gave me much pleasure. 
Marks of remembrance from old acquaintances, and the 
society of fellow-citizens in a foreign country, excite agree- 
able sensations. I have, as yet, met with neither men nor 
things on this side of the water which abate my predilec- 
tion, or, if you please, my prejudices in favour of those on 
the other. I have but few attachments in Europe much 
stronger than those we sometimes feel for an accidental 
fellow-traveller, or for a good inn and a civil landlord. 
We leave our approbation, and good wishes, and a certain 
degree of regard with them, by way of paying that part of 
the reckoning and travelling expenses which money cannot 
always defray. My affections are deeply rooted in America, 
and are of too long standing to admit of transplantation. 
In short, my friend, I can never become so far a citizen of 
the world as to view every part of it with equal regard ; 
and perhaps nature is wiser in tying our hearts to our native 
soil, than they are who think they divest themselves of foi- 
bles in proportion as they wear away those bonds. It is 
not difficult to regard men of every nation as members of 
the same family ; but when placed in that point of view, 
my fellow-citizens appear to me as my brethren, and the 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 131 

others as related to me only in the more distant and adven- 
titious degrees. 

I am glad my letter by Mr. Grigby gave you reason to 
infer an alteration for the better in the state of my health, 
because I flatter myself it afforded pleasure to my friends. 
The tact is, that my disorder has been gradually declining 
ever since I left the city ; but although the pain in my 
breast has diminished, it still continues, and daily tells me 
memento mori. As to the fever which the influenza left 
me, it has at last, thank God, taken its leave. During all 
my sickness, I have been happy in preserving a constant 
flow of spirits ; and cheerfulness, that agreeable companion, 
has never forsaken me. I hope a trip to Bath will so 
patch up my " house of clay" as to render it tenantable 
a good while longer ; a thorough repair I do not promise 
myself. 

Your account of my son pleases me. I expect and wish 
to see him next summer ; for it is time to lay the founda- 
tion of those habits and principles by which I am desirous 
that his conduct through life should be influenced. Nature 
has not given to children any instinctive affections for their 
parents ; and youth, that fair season of virtue and ingenu- 
ousness, presents the only opportunity for our perfectly 
gaining their hearts. This conspires with a great variety of 
other considerations to call me home ; and I should not be 
satisfied with myself if I prolonged my excursion from pri- 
vate life beyond the term which, for public reasons, I at first 
prescribed it. When a man's conduct ceases to be uniform 
and consistent, it ceases to be proper. My little girls are 
well, and their mother is not much otherwise. So much 
for domestic matters ; now for a few lines on politics. 

While there are knaves and fools in the world, there will 
be wars in it ; and that nations should make war against 
nations is less surprising than their living in uninterrupted 
peace and harmony. 

You have heard that the Ottoman and Russian empires are 



132 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

on the point of unsheathing the sword. The objects of the 
contest are more easy to discern than the issue ; but if Russia 
should extend her navigation to Constantinople, we may be 
the better for it That circumstance is an additional mo- 
tive to our forming a treaty of commerce with her. Your 
commercial and geographical knowledge render it unneces- 
sary for me to enlarge on this subject. But whatever we 
may have to do abroad, it is of little consequence when 
compared to what we have to do at home. 

I am perfectly convinced that no time is to be lost in 
raising and maintaining a national spirit in America. Power 
to govern the confederacy, as to all general purposes, should 
be granted and exercised. The governments of the different 
States should be wound up, and become vigorous. America 
is beheld with jealousy, and jealousy is seldom idle. Settle 
your boundaries without delay. It is better that some 
improper limits should be fixed, than any left in dispute. 
In a word, every thing conducive to union and constitu- 
tional energy of government should be cultivated, cherished, 
and protected, and all counsels and measures of a contrary 
complexion should at least be suspected of impolitic views 
and objects. 

The rapid progress of luxury at Philadelphia is a frequent 
topic of conversation here ; and what is a little remarkable, 
I have not heard a single person speak of it in terms of 
.approbation.

Passy, 28th September, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 
Mr- Carter lately delivered to me your friendly letter of 
the 25th of July last. You was always of the number of 
those whom I esteemed, and your correspondence would 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 133 

have been both interesting and agreeable. I had heard of 
your marriage, and it gave me pleasure, as well because it 
added to your happiness, as because it tended to fix your 
residence in a State, of which I long wished you to be, and 
remain a citizen. 

The character and talents of delegates to Congress daily 
become more and more important, and I regret your decli- 
ning that appointment at this interesting period. Respect, 
however, is due to the considerations which influence you; 
but as they do not oppose your accepting a place in the 
Legislature, I hope the public will still continue to derive 
advantage from your services. Much remains to be done, 
and labourers do not abound. 

I am happy to hear that the terms of peace, and the con- 
duct of your negotiators, give general satisfaction ; but 
there are some of our countrymen, it seems, who are not 
content, and that too with an article which I thought to be 
very unexceptionable, viz. the one ascertaining our bounda- 
ries. Perhaps those gentlemen are latitudinarians. 

The American newspapers, for some months past, contain 
advices that do us harm. Violences, and associations 
against the tories, pay an ill compliment to government, 
and impeach our good faith in the opinions of some, and our 
magnanimity in the opinions of many. Our reputation 
also suffers from the apparent reluctance to taxes, and the 
ease with winch we incur debts without providing for their 
payment. The complaints of the army — the jealousies 
respecting Congress — the circumstances which induced 
their leaving Philadelphia — and the too little appearance of 
a national spirit, pervading, uniting, and invigorating the 
confederacy, are considered as omens which portend the 
diminution of our respectability, power, and felicity. I 
hope that, as the wheel turns round, other and better indi- 
cations will soon appear. I am persuaded that America 
possesses too much wisdom and virtue to permit her brilliant 
prospects to fade away for the want of either. But, what- 



134 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

ever time may produce, certain it is, that our reputation 
and our affairs suffer from present appearances. 

The tories are as much pitied in these countries as they 
are execrated in ours. An undue degree of severity 
towards them would, therefore, be impolitic as well as 
unjustifiable. They who incline to involve that whole class 
of men in indiscriminate punishment and ruin, certainly 
carry the matter too far. It would be an instance of un- 
necessary rigour, and unmanly revenge, without a parallel, 
except in the annals of religious rage, in times of bigotry 
and blindness. What does it signify where nine-tenths of 
these people are buried ? I would rather see the sweat of 
their brows fertilizing our fields than those of our nei^h- 
bours, in which it would certainly water those seeds of 
hatred, which, if so cultivated, may produce a hedge of 
thorns against us. Shall all be pardoned then? By no 
means. Banish and confiscate the estates' of such of 
them as have been either faithless or cruel, and forgive 
the rest. 

Victory and peace should, in my opinion, be followed by 
clemency, moderation, and benevolence, and we should be 
careful not to sully the glory of the revolution by licentious- 
ness and cruelty. These are my sentiments, and however 
unpopular they may be, I have not the least desire to con- 
ceal or disguise them. 

Be pleased to present my best compliments to Mrs. 
Hamilton, and believe me to be, 

With great esteem and regard, dear sir, 

Your most obedient humble servant, 

John Jay.

Dear Sir, 
I hear your health is fnended since the date of your last 
letter of the 20th July, and rejoice at it. Your distant

friends suffer irreparable injury if you are indisposed to 
write; those who write so well should write often, and 
even your short letters say so much in so few words, that 
it is impossible not to wish for them, if longer ones cannot 
be had. I acknowledge the force of all your observations 
on my intended resignation, and know the necessity of per- 
severance so long as there is a prospect of being useful ; 
but you must also acknowledge that it is folly in the ex- 
treme to continue in the drudgery of office after you see 
clearly that the public cannot be benefited ; your own 
affairs suffering, your feelings daily wounded, and your 
reputation endangered by the malice and misrepresentation 
of envious and designing men. During the war, I was 
determined to go through with the work I had undertaken, 
and although my resignation was made before the signing 
of the provisional treaty was known, yet I made no hesita- 
tion to declare to a committee of Congress, that if the war 
lasted I would continue. The war, however, ceased — 
Congress feared to dismiss their army without some pay ; 
they had not money, and could only make payment by 
paper anticipation, and even this could not be effected 
without my assistance. I was urged to continue, and 
forced into that anticipation. The army was dispersed, 
and since their departure, the men who urged these meas- 
ures most, and who are eternally at war with honour and 
integrity, have been continually employed in devising 
measures to prevent my being able to fulfil my engage- 
ments, in hopes of effecting my ruin in case of failure. I 
must, however, in justice to the majority of Congress, 
which has ever been composed of honest men, declare that 
the faction I allude to is but inconsiderable in numbers, 
although they make themselves of some consequence by 
this assiduity. You know the ****, &c. : I should disre- 
gard these men totally, if I found a disposition in the 
several Legislatures to support national faith, credit, and 
character ; but, unhappily, there is at present a total inat- 



136 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

tendon on their parts. I am, however, persuaded, that 
sooner or later, the good sense of America will prevail, and 
that our governments will be intrusted in the hands of men 
whose principles will lead them to do justice, and whose 
understandings w T ill teach the value of national credit. 
This may be too long in coming to pass, at least for me, 
and therefore you may rest assured, that I quit all public 
employ the moment my engagements are fulfilled. 

The court of France having refused the last sum asked, 
I do not wish to trouble them further. I am not sensible 
of having at any time made an improper application, either 
as to substance or manner. Those who are solicited in 
such cases, are in the situation to make whatever objections 
they find convenient. I wish, however, that the ministers 
in France were sensible of one truth, which is, that my ad- 
ministration either saved them a good deal of money, or a 
great deal of disgrace ; for if I had not undertaken it when 
I did, they must either have advanced ten times the amount 
I received, or have deserted America, after having under- 
taken her cause, and perhaps have been obliged to subscribe 
to very indifferent terms of peace for themselves. 

It is happy for me that the loan in Holland stepped in to 
our relief, after the refusal of the court to grant the mode- 
rate sum of 3,000,000 livres as the concluding point. This 
refusal was ill-timed and impolitic. I could show resent- 
ment with some effect, if I were so disposed ; but so far 
from it, I retain a grateful remembrance of past favours, 
and make a point to promote the commercial intercourse 
between France and this country. I must also show my 
sense of the obligations conferred on us by the Hollanders. 
We hear that the definitive treaty is signed. I long to see 
it ; for you may depend that unless some new articles are 
added respecting our intercourse with the British West 
Indies, it will be both a work of difficulty and time to carry 
measures that will justify your opinion of us. I thank you 
for the kind sentiments which you express of me in several 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 1,37 

parts of your letters. I will endeavour to deserve them. 
I do not know whether Gouverneur writes to you by this 
opportunity ; you must cherish his friendship, it is worth 
possessing, lie has more virtue than he shows, and more 
consistency than anybody believes. He values you exceed- 
ingly, and hereafter you will be very useful to each other. 
Mrs. Morris will write to Mrs. Jay, and say for herself 
what she has to say ; though I don't believe she will tell 
her, as she docs to everybody else, the high estimation in 
which she holds Mrs. Jay and yourself. Permit me also, 
my worthy friend, to assure you both of the sincerity of 
that affection with which I profess myself

London, 14th November, 1783. 
Dear Sir, 

I have been here a month, and well only two days. I 
came in quest of health, but " seek ami you shall find" does 
not, it seems, always extend to that of the body. 

The parliament is sitting. The king's speech and its 
echoes you will see in the papers. I have not had any 
conversation on politics with either of the ministers. In 
my opinion, no plan or system of conduct respecting Amer- 
ica is yet decided upon by the cabinet, in which the jarring 
principles of whig and tory still strive and ferment. The 
latter persuade themselves that we shall not be able to act 
as a nation, that our governments are too feeble to command 
respect, and our credit too much abased to recover its 
reputation, or merit confidence. I hope better things. We 
are not without friends in tins country, but they have more 
inclination than power to be friendly. We have also ene- 
mies, and bitter ones. If we act wisely and unitedly, we 
have nothing to fear. It is in our power finally to make a 
navigation act, and prevent British vessels carrying our

productions ; provided we should execute it, we would find 
it of as much value as many treaties of commerce. Let 
us act, however, with temper ; it is more easy to make 
sores than to heal them. But if Britain should adopt and 
persist in a monopolizing system, let us retaliate fully and 
firmly. This nation, like many others, is influenced more 
by its feelings than reasonings. I am, dear sir, 

Your affectionate friend and servant, 

John Jay. 

from robert morris. 

Philadelphia, November 27th, 1783. 
My dear Sir, 

I congratulate you on the signing of the definitive treaty.. 
and on the evacuation of New- York, which took place on 
Tuesday. Our friend Gouverneur Morris is there. He 
has been gone about eighteen days, and I expect him back 
very soon ; he will then give you the detail, and inform you 
of such things as you may wish to know respecting any of 
your particular friends. 

If Great Britain persists in refusing admittance to our 
ships in their islands, they will probably have great cause 
to repent, for I shall not be surprised to see a general pro- 
hibition to the admittance of theirs into our ports ; and if 
such a measure is once adopted, they may find it very dif- 
ficult to obtain any alteration, and in that case the advan- 
tages of carrying will be much against them. Should the 
court of France pursue the same policy, we shall fall in 
with the Dutch, and probably have more connexions in 
commerce with them than with any other people. I have 
received the prints of the rise and fall of the balloon. Pray 
cannot they contrive to send passengers with a man to 
steer the course, so as to make them the means of con- 
veyance for despatches from one country to another, or 
must they only be sent for intelligence to the moon and 
clouds ? 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 139 

We are dismissing the remains of our army, and getting 
rid of expense, so that I hope to sec the end of my engage- 
ments before next May, but I doubt whether it will be in 
my power to observe that punctuality in performing them, 
which I wish and have constantly aimed at. 

I am sending some ships to China, in order to encourage 
others in the adventurous pursuits of commerce, and I wish 
to see a foundation laid for an American navy. 

I am, dear sir,

from robert r. livingston. 

New-York, 29th Nov., 1783. 
Dear John, 

I am two letters in your debt, and am conscious that I 
shall make an ill return for them in offering you this pro- 
duct of a midnight hour, after a day spent in the fatigue of 
business and ceremony that our present situation exacts. 
But having just been informed by Mr. Piatt that he sails 
to-morrow morning, I cannot permit him to go, without 
offering you my congratulations on an event which you 
have so greatly contributed to bring about, the evacuation 
of tins city by the British on Tuesday last. 

Our enemies are hardly more astonished than we are 
ourselves, and than you will be when you hear that we 
have been five days in town without the smallest disturb- 
ance ; that the most obnoxious royalists that had sufficient 
confidence in our clemency to stay had not met with the 
least insult. Their shops were opened the day after we 
came in, and Rivington himself goes on as usual. The 
State of New York Gazette is as well received as if he had 
never been printer to the king's most excellent majesty. 
So that your friends in Europe will find their apprehensions 
ill-founded, and that the race of tories will not, after all, be 
totally extinct in America. Perhaps, by good training and

by crossing the breed frequently (as they are very tame), 
they may be rendered useful animals in a few generations. 

I thank you for your prints of the air-balls ; but wish to 
have some fuller account of their composition, and the use 
proposed to be made of them. As an architect, I cannot 
but be curious about the first castles in the air that promise 
to have some stable use. 

Receive my congratulations on the birth of your daugh- 
ter, and make my compliments to Mrs. Jay on the occasion. 

I had hardly finished the last line, when I was alarmed 
by a very loud rumbling noise, accompanied by a quick 
tremulous motion of the earth. The family are too much 
alarmed to permit me to add more. Adieu.

TO MISS KITTY LIVINGSTON. 

Bath, 24th Dec, 1783. 
Dear Kitty, 

Why so long silent, my good friend ? Many months 
have elapsed since we have been favoured with a line from 
you. I hope want of health has not obliged you to deny us 
that satisfaction. Want of inclination, I am sure, has not. 
Of that we have received too many unequivocal proofs to 
entertain the most distant doubt. You have long been my 
faithful, steady friend. I know the value of your esteem 
and regard, and be assured that you possess mine in a very 
high degree. Much do I wish for the happy moment when 
we shall all meet, and when Ave shall communicate to each 
other many things, which, however interesting, must be 
very sparingly trusted to paper. The necessity of this 
caution has imposed upon us a long and painful reserve, for 
between friends, few things are more agreeable, as well as 
useful, than free and undisguised communications. This is 
a pleasure to which I have been greatly a stranger since I 
left America, and it is in that country only that I expect 
again to enjoy it. Experience has taught me reserve, but 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 1 11 

it has also taught me that with you it will he unnecessary. 
This is a pleasant idea, and my mind dwells upon it with 
great satisfaction. How few are there in this world, my 
dear Kate, capable of a firm, uniform attachment; much 
fewer, I assure you, than I once thought: but youth is 
credulous, and consequently must be often disappointed. 
I hope my disappointments are nearly at an end ; for I ex- 
pect very little, except from you and a few others. 

I have letters from Sally almost every week. Thank 
God, she continues well. She tells me our little girls grow 
charming]}'. My absence from her has been much longer 
than I expected. On coming to London, I w T as taken ill of 
a dysentery, and afterward, with a sore throat. Some 
remains of the latter still trouble me. Upon the wdiole, 
however, I am better, and the waters of this place have 
done me good. I propose next week to return to London, 
and from thence make the best of my way to France. I 
am impatient to be w r ith my little family, and to have my 
sweet little girls upon my knee, while their mother tells me 
the domestic occurrences which have happened in my ab- 
sence. Believe me to be, with great and sincere regard, 

Your friend and servant, 

John Jay. 

from golverneur morris. 

Philadelphia, 10th January, 1784. 

Dear Jay, 

I write to acknowledge your letter of the 24th Sep- 
tember. Being uncertain where you are, and consequently 
what course this letter may take, and through what hands 
it will pass, I shall not say so much as I otherwise might. 
I will direct to the care of Dr. Franklin. 

Your attachment to America, when removed from it, is 
the old storv of travellers ; but when it comes from one in 
w r hose feelings we feel an interest, decies repetita placebit. 
Of your health you speak despondingly, yet you say your 



142 LIFE OP JOHN JAY. 

spirits are good. Believe me, my friend, good spirits will 
both make and preserve good health. I mean to extend 
the observation generally, but not universally. Whatever lot 
betides us, I wish you at least one happy year, and I hope 
that Heaven will do you the justice to grant a long succes- 
sion of them. Make my good wishes acceptable to Mrs. 
Jay, and present me tenderly to your children. 

I was lately in New-York, and have the pleasure to tell 
you that all your friends were well. Things there are now 
in that kind of ferment which was rationally to have been 
expected ; and I think the superior advantages of our con- 
stitution will now appear in the repressing of those turbu- 
lent spirits who wish for confusion, because that in the 
regular order of things they can only fill a subordinate 
sphere. 

This country has never yet been known to Europe, and 
God knows whether it ever will be so. To England it is 
less known than to any other part of Europe ; because 
they constantly view it through a medium either of preju- 
dice or of faction. True it is, that the general government 
wants energy ; and equally true it is that this want will 
eventually be supplied. A national spirit is the natural re- 
sult of national existence ; and although some of the present 
generation may feel colonial oppositions of opinion, that 
generation will die away, and give place to a race of 
Americans. On this occasion, as on others, Great Britain 
is our best friend ; and by seizing the critical moment when 
we were about to divide, she has shown clearly the dread- 
ful consequences of division. You will find that the States 
are coming into resolutions on the subject of commerce ; 
which, if they had been proposed by Congress on the plain 
reason of the thing, would have been rejected with resent- 
ment, and perhaps contempt. 

With respect to our taste for luxury, do not grieve about 
it. Luxury is not so bad a thing as it is often supposed to 
be ; and if it were, still we must follow the course of tilings, 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 1 13 

and turn to advantage what exists, since we have not the 
power to annihilate or create. The very definition of lux- 
ury is as difficult as the suppression of it. 

Do not condemn us till you see us. Do not ask the 
British to take off their foolish restrictions. Let them 
alone, and they will be obliged to do it themselves. While 
the present regulation exists, it does us more of political 
good than it can possibly do of commercial evil. 

Adieu. Believe me always, yours, 

GoUVERNEER MORRIS.

London, Jan. 21st. 1784. 

Sir, 

1 called at your lodgings in November last, but your 
servant told me you was not within, and that you intended 
to set out for Bath in a day or two ; on which, being ex- 
ceedingly desirous of an interview with you, I sent you a 
letter requesting that favour; but going out of town myself 
a few days after, and having received no answer, I am at 
a loss what to conclude on, whether my letter might have 
failed, or that vou do not incline to favour me with an in-

terview ; and hence I am induced to trouble you with this, 
and to request that you will simply inform me by a line, if 
you received my letter of November, and if an interview 
will be agreeable or not. I wish to obviate and remove 
any late prejudices which you may have entertained against 
me, from the most gross misrepresentations of my conduct 
since my arrival in England ; and I submit to you the pro- 
priety of giving me an opportunity for doing this ; and am, 
with great respect, sir, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

Silas Deane. 



144 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 



TO SILAS DEANE. 

Chaillot, near Paris, 23d February, 1784. 

Sir, 

Your letter of the 21st of January was delivered to me 
this morning. It is painful to say disagreeable things to 
any person, and especially to those with whom one has lived 
in habits of friendship ; but candour on this subject forbids 
reserve. You was of the number of those who possessed 
my esteem, and to whom I was attached. To me, person- 
ally, you have never given offence ; but, on the contrary, I 
am persuaded you sincerely wished me well, and was dis- 
posed to do me good offices. 

The card you left for me at Mr. Bingham's, and also the 
letter you mention, were both delivered to me ; and I can- 
not express the regret I experienced from the cruel necessity 
I thought myself under, of passing them over in silence ; 
but I love my country and my honour better than my friends, 
and even my family, and am ready to part with them all 
whenever it would be improper to retain them. You are 
either exceedingly injured, or you are no friend to America ; 
and while doubts remain on that point, all connexion 
between us must be suspended. I wished to hear what 
you might have to say on that head, and should have named 
a time and place for an interview, had not an insurmountable 
obstacle intervened to prevent it. I was told by more than 
one, on whose information I thought I could rely, that you 
received visits from, and was on terms of familiarity with 
General Arnold. Every American who gives his hand to 
that man, in my opinion, pollutes it. 

I think it my duty to deal thus candidly with you, and I 
assure you, with equal sincerity, that it would give me cor- 
dial satisfaction to find you able to acquit yourself in the 
judgment of the dispassionate and impartial. If it is in 
your power to do it, I think you do yourself injustice by 
not undertaking that necessary task. That you may per- 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 145 

form it successfully, whenever you undertake it, is the 
sincere wish and desire of, sir, 

Your most obedient humble servant, 

John Jay. 

from robert r. livingston. 

New-York, 25th January, 1784. 
Dear John, 

The quiet, which in my last I mentioned to have prevailed 
here, still continues with very few interruptions. Though 
the imprudence of the tories has, in some instances, given 
disgust to the warm whigs, particularly in a contest for the 
government of the church corporation, to the exclusion of 
those out of the lines, and in appointing Mr. Moore rector, 
in order to fill the church, a few days before we came in. 
The Legislature have interposed, and the government of the 
church is transferred to the whigs. 

Our parties are, first, the tories, who still hope for power, 
under the idea that the remembrance of the past should be 
lost, though they daily keep it up by their avowed attach- 
ment to Great Britain. Secondly, the violent whigs, who 
are for expelling all tories from the State, in hopes, by that 
means, to preserve the power in their own hands. The 
third are those who wish to suppress all violences, to soften 
the rigour of the laws against the royalists, and not to banish 
them from that social intercourse which may, by degrees, 
obliterate the remembrance of past misdeeds ; but who, at 
the same time, are not willing to shock the feelings of the 
virtuous citizens, that have at every expense and hazard 
fulfilled their duty, by at once destroying all distinction 
between them and the royalists, and giving the reins into 
the hands of the latter ; but who, at the same time, wish that 
this distinction should rather be found in the sentiments of the 
people, than marked out by the laws. You will judge to 
whieh of these parties the disqualifications contained in our 
election bill has given the representation, when I tell you 

VOL. II. T 



J46 IJ.FE OF JOHiV JAY. 

that the members for this city and county are Lamb, Har- 
per, Sears, Van Zandt, Mallone, Rutgers, Hughes, Stag, 
and Willet. I must, however, do all parties the justice to 
say, that they profess the highest respect for the laws, and 
that, if we except one or two persons, they have, as yet, by 
no act contradicted that profession. 

We are very angry here with Great Britain, on account 
of her West India restrictions (from which, by-the-bye, they 
suffer greatly), and are fulminating resolutions to prohibit 
all intercourse with her, which I think will probably be the 
case ere long. 

Thus have I given you a sketch of our politics, which 
will only be interesting to you if, as I sincerely hope, you 
mean to return soon to us. 

Politics has extended this letter to such an unreasonable 
length, that I dare not hazard a subject nearer my heart 
than either, but must, at this time, confine all its dictates to 
simple assurances of the firm and tender affection with 
which I am, and ever shall be, 

Dear John, your friend,

TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Paris, 10th February, 1784. 
Dear Morris, 
Your letter of the 25th September came to my hands in 
England on the 8th December last ; and since my return, 
I have received that of the 7th November, which, though 
containing only three lines, I prefer to most of the others. 
Perhaps you have forgot it. 

" It is now within three minutes of the time when the 
mail is made up and sent off. I cannot, therefore, do more 
than just to assure you of the continuance of my love, 
Adieu. Yours, 

"G. M." 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 147 

That this letter was so short, I ascribe to procrastina- 
tion ; that it was written at all, I ascribe to your heart : 
your head evidently had no concern in it ; for, if consulted, 
it would have intimated that they who live near a post- 
office, find no good excuse for singular brevity in the mail's 
being to be sent off in a few minutes after they sit down to 
write, unless, indeed, some circumstance just occurred should 
make the subject of the letter. But, be that as it may, I 
would rather receive one little effusion from your heart 
than twenty from your head, though I hope to derive much 
pleasure from both. We shall have much to say to each 
other, and I think both of us will be gainers by it. Why I 
think so, must not be discussed in letters, whose seals will 
not be respected. 

You suppose that ill health induces me to resign. You 
are mistaken. It seldom happens that any measure is 
prompted by one single motive, though one among others 
may sometimes have decisive weight and influence. Many 
motives induce me to resign ; but of those many there is 
one which predominates, and that is this : — When I em- 
barked in the public service, I said very sincerely that I 
quitted private life with regret, and should be happy to 
return to it when the objects which called me from it should 
be attained. You know what those objects were, and that, 
on the peace, they ceased to operate. To be consistent, 
therefore, I must retire. The motive is irresistible. Super- 
added to this are the education of my son, the attention I 
owe to the unfortunate part of my family, and the happi- 
ness I expect from rejoining my friends. Pecuniary con- 
siderations ever held a secondary place in my estimation. 1 
know how to live within the limits of any income, however 
narrow ; and my pride is not of a nature to be hurt by 
returning to the business which I formerly followed : but 
professions of this sort are common, and facts only can give 
unequivocal evidence of their sincerity. 

I have passed between three and four sad months in 



148 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

England. Bad weather and bad health almost the whole 
time. On my arrival, a dysentery and fever brought me 
low, and a sore-throat, which still plagues me, succeeded. 
Bath has done me good, for it removed the pain in my 
breast, which has been almost constant for eighteen months. 

I had many excellent opportunities of writing to my 
friends from London and Bristol, but I was enjoined to 
abstain as much as possible from pen and ink. 

It is natural that you should expect to find some news in 
this letter. I will tell you a little, though it is probable that 
your sagacity has prevented its being unexpected. The 
institution of the Order of Cincinnatus does not, in the 
opinion of the wisest men whom I have heard speak on the 
subject, either do credit to those who formed and patronised, 
or to those who suffered it. 

I am indebted to our excellent friend, Robert Morris, for 
a very obliging letter. He shall soon hear from me. In 
the mean time, let him share with you in this adieu. 

Yours sincerely, 

John Jay.

New- York, Feb. 18th, 1784. 
Dear Sir, 

By Colonel Hamilton, who made me a visit at Albany 
on the 26th instant, I had the pleasure of your favour of the 
16th September last. Persuaded you never convey senti- 
ments to your friends, which flow merely from the head, 
and in which the heart does not participate, I have not 
words to express how pleasingly mine was affected in the 
perusal. 

I think I hear you wish to be advised of what is passing 
in your native country, at a juncture when the decisions of 
government must determine the philosophers and politicians 
of Europe to form their opinion of our wisdom or our folly. 
Having been exceedingly indisposed, I have not attended 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 1 IS 

until a few days ago, and am consequently, as yet, not in a 
situation to speak decidedly ; but I have reason to appre- 
hend, however, from the complexion of the members, that 
our conduct will be such as to afford occasion to the friend 
of mankind to drop a tear on the intemperance of mankind ; 
and to reflect, with pain, that a people who have hardly 
been emancipated from a threatened tyranny, forgetting 
how odious oppression appeared to them, begin to play the 
tyrant, and give a melancholy evidence, that however capa- 
ble we were of bearing adversity with magnanimity, we 
are too weak to support, with propriety, the prosperity we 
have so happily experienced. 

I am led to this conclusion from observing that too many, 
not contented with a peace, glorious and advantageous 
beyond the expectations of the most sanguine real patriot, 
and that, too, obtained at a period when the complexion of 
our national affairs was alarming in the extreme, wish to 
evade the positive stipulations, few and inconsiderable as 
they are, in favour of those who adhered to Britain ; and 
carry their view even so far beyond that, as totally to 
deprive all those who remained within the power of the 
British troops from the rights of citizens, upon the false con- 
clusion that all who remained in were zealous adherents to 
the then enemy, and all who were not, disinterested and real 
patriots. I think you and I could point out some who 
looked at both sides of the question whilst the contest was 
doubtful, and who probably did not wish it to terminate as 
it has done ; and yet these are the very characters who are 
now most vociferous against that set of people, to whom, 
but a few months before the annunciation of the provisional 
articles, they still paid court. I hope, however, when the 
present scramblers for the honours and the emoluments of 
the States are satisfied, that our affairs will take another 
turn, and that we shall not irretrievably lose our national 
character. Among those claimants and scramblers you 
will not include some whose zeal for the common cause, 



150 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

from the first stage of the contest to the close, are justly- 
entitled to the attention of government — such as Mr. Duane, 
who has the mayoralty of this city, and some others. 

When I assure you that I am anxious for your speedy 
return to your native country, and that it is more than a 
selfish wish, I am very sincere ; for I believe your influ- 
ence would tend much to promote its true interest. 

Permit me to entreat your lady to participate with you 
in wishes which come from the heart, for your health and 
happiness, and for your speedy and safe arrival on these 
shores where you will find friends who love and esteem 
you, and where all ought to revere you who are capable of 
being penetrated with gratitude for the most eminent ser- 
vices. For my part, I never think of you without emotions 
too delicate for communication. God bless you. 

I am, affectionately and sincerely, 
Your obedient servant, 

Philip Schuyler. 

to robert morris. 

Paris, 25th February, 1784. 

My good Friend, 

Your favour of the 4th November last found me in Eng- 
land, where, though I suffered much sickness, I left the pain 
in my breast ; but a sore throat I caught there still remains 
obstinate and troublesome. 

The resolution of Congress of 1st October last, did not 
reach me until in December. On my return here last 
month, I wrote in pursuance of it to Mr. Carmichael to 
come here without delay with the books and vouchers. I 
daily expect to hear from him, and shall be happy to see 
that business settled before I embark, which I hope will be 
in April, but from or to what port, and in what vessel, is as 
yet uncertain. 

There is no doubt but that you have had much to struggle 
with, and will have more. Difficulties must continue in- 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 151 

separable from your office for some time yet, and they will 
be the means either of increasing or diminishing your repu- 
tation. In my opinion you must go on. Success generally 
attends talents and perseverance, and these thorns will in 
due season probably bear flowers, if not fruit. 

There are parts of your letter, on which, though I con- 
cur with you in sentiment, I forbear to make remarks, 
because this may not pass to you uninspected. I hope we 
shall meet in the course of a few months more, and then 
reserve will cease to be necessary. 

What you say of Gouverneur accords with my opinion 
of him. I have never broken the bands of friendship in 
my life, nor when once broken, have I ever been anxious 
to mend them. Mine with him will, I hope, last as long as 
we do, for though my sentiments of mankind in general are 
less favourable than formerly, my affection for certain indi- 
viduals is as warm and cordial as ever. 

Mrs. Jay presents her affectionate compliments to you 
and Mrs. Morris, to whom we join in sincerely wishing all 
the happiness with which amiable merit should be ever 
blessed. Tell Gouverneur I long to take him by the hand, 
and believe me to be, my dear sir, 

With constant attachment, 
Your affectionate friend and servant, 

John Jay.

Chaillot, near Paris, 21st March, 1784. 

Dear Sir, 

The violence of your political storm seems to have abated, 
but I should not be surprised if you should frequently have 
March weather. 

Accounts from America lead me to suspect that your 
commercial negotiations with us will not be facilitated by 
delay ; and I should not be surprised if a system should 
then be adopted, which would render European proclama- 



152 LIFE OP JOHN JAY. 

tions of very little importance to that country. It appears 
more probable that England will outwit herself. There is 
a tide in human affairs which, like other tides, turns only 
to run in an opposite direction. 

I am preparing to go to New-York by the first good 
vessel that may sail for that port. I more than wish to see 
you there. They who know the nature of man expect per- 
fection nowhere. There are certain degrees in refinement 
and arts, which are more favourable than others to those 
principles and manners which wise men prefer. In this, as 
well as in some other circumstances, we have the advantage 
of other countries. Various causes conspire to give every 
man his weight, and I believe the old maxim of " quisque 
sues faber est fortunes? has fewer exceptions in America 
than elsewhere. They who bring with them ideas bor- 
rowed from the regions of fancy and romance will be dis- 
appointed. The golden age will not cease to be a fable 
until the millennium ; until that period for separating life 
from death, pleasure from pain, virtue from vice, and 
wisdom from folly, every society and country will continue 
to partake more or less of the heterogeneous and discordant 
principles, which seem to be the seeds both of moral and 
natural evil. 

Were I in your situation, I would see for myself, and 
then determine. To avoid mistakes, it is necessary to see 
things as being what they really are. Minutias are often 
omitted, or imperfectly drawn in representations. Great 
part of the good within our reach depend on minutiae ; they 
merit more attention than many apprehend. 

Be pleased to present my respectful compliments to Lord 
and Lady Shelburne. I hope his gout has left him. Re- 
member me also to our patriot friend, Doctor Price. 

Adieu my dear sir, 

Yours, sincerely, 

John Jay. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 153 



FROM JOHN' ADAMS. 

The Hague, April 2d, 1784. 

My Dear Friend, 

I blush to acknowledge that I received your favour of 
the 6th February, in its season, and in good condition, and 
that I have not answered it. 

By leading a quiet life, and by great care and regular 
exercise, I have happily recovered a little health, and if you 
think it necessary, I might now venture on a journey to 
Paris. But I should be glad to wait here six weeks longer, 
that I may increase my stock of strength a little more, if 
possible, provided you will give me leave. • I should be glad 
to know what you have upon the carpet, and how advanced, 
in brief, if you please. 

The money for the payment of Mr. Morris's bills is hap- 
pily secured, but we were a long time in bringing the loan 
to bear. 

I have received several letters from Boston and Phila- 
delphia, from very good hands, which make very honour- 
able and affectionate mention of you. You have erected a 
monument to your memory in every New-England heart. 
My regards to your good family, and believe me, 

Your sincere friend, 

John Adams,

Chaillot, near Paris, 6th April, 1784. 
Dear Sir. 

I had last evening the pleasure of receiving your favour 
of the 27th ult. I congratulate you on your safe arrival, 
and sincerely wish that the same good fortune may attend 
your return. 

While our country remained part of the. British empire, 
there was no impropriety in soliciting the <i'u{ ol our distant 
brethren and fellow-subjects for any liberal and public pur- 

vol. ir. — u 



154 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

poses. It was natural that the younger branches of the 
political family should request and accept the assistance of 
the elder. But as the United States neither have, nor can 
have, such relations with any nations in the world ; as the 
rank they hold and ought to assert, implies ability to provide 
for ail the ordinary objects of their government ; and as the 
diffusion of knowledge among a republican people, is and 
ought to be one of the constant and most important of those 
objects, I cannot think it consistent with the dignity of a 
free and independent people, to solicit donations for that or 
any other purpose, from the subjects of any prince or state 
whatever. 

The public, with us, are, in my opinion, so deeply inter- 
ested in the education of our citizens, that universities, &c, 
ought no longer to be regarded in the light of mere private 
corporations. The government should extend to them their 
constant care ; and the State treasuries afford them neces- 
sary supplies. 

The success which might attend such applications in this 
country, can only be matter of conjecture. The raising 
money by subscription has not been so customary in France 
as in Britain, and my opinion is, that you would collect 
very little. If indeed the court should set the example, 
and really wish to promote it, the thing would then become 
fashionable ; and I am inclined to think that even the fashion 
of giving would have a great run for a few weeks. As to 
books, the consideration that every American student, who 
in a long lapse of years might open those books, would read 
the name of the donor, added to the vanity of authors, and 
others who may be zealous to extend the reputation of 
French literature, would probably procure you some. As 
to apparatus, the best instruments and machines are made 
in England ; and the greater, as well as better part of those 
used here, are, I am told, brought from thence. I am much 
mistaken if Europe, in general, does not wish that we were 
less knowing than we are already. But if it was probable 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 155 

that such applications would be attended with ever so great 
success, yet as I think they can be properly made only in 
the United States, I could not prevail upon myself to advise 
the experiment. 

If, however, you should visit Paris, I assure you it will 
give me great pleasure to see you, and to be instrumental 
in rendering it agreeable to you. We have been fellow- 
labourers in the same field, and if you come, we will rejoice 
together in celebrating " harvest home." 

With respect to the disagreeable voyage in which your 
son shared with us, 1 won't say jubes renovare dolorem, 
because I am habituated to reflect on events of that sort 
with tranquillity. It was one of those, however, which 
tried all who were concerned in it ; and I must do your 
son the justice to say, that none of us preserved more equa- 
nimity and good-humour throughout the whole than he did, 
and he had a full share of unpleasant circumstances, as 
well as some others of us. 

I am, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

John Jay.

Chaillot, near Paris, 7th April, 1784. 
My good Friend, 

It gave me pleasure to receive your obliging letter of the 
30th December, and the more so, as the one to Sally which 
accompanies it contains agreeable accounts of your health. 
Accept my thanks for the kind wishes which the season 
gave you occasion to offer. In your sincerity I have full 
confidence ; and in your happiness, I feel that interest 
which long-confirmed esteem and attachment never fails to 
create. 

If the ensuing summer should bring us all together in 
health and spirits, I shall think the day of my arrival one 
of the most fortunate of my life. After having passed so 



156 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

many years in scenes of trouble and difficulty of various 
kinds, I look forward with emotion not to be described to 
that peaceful circle of my friends and family, where I again 
expect to meet the enjoyments which have so long deserted 
me. God only knows what futurity may have in store for 
us, or what adverse events may still continue to teach us 
lessons of resignation. It is happy for us, however, that 
hope is our constant companion, and that new expectations 
constantly succeed the disappointment of preceding ones. 

Having expected that Mr. Carmichael would have arrived 
with the public accounts in time to have them settled 
before the A] nil packet engaged her passengers, I had 
taken steps for going in her ; but he did not reach Paris till 
the 27th ult., and Mr. Barclay, who is to settle them, being 
then and still absent, I must necessarily be detained here 
till in May. I hope, but am not sure, that I shall then em- 
bark. In matters which do not depend upon myself, or 
people like you, I dare not be sanguine. Such of our bag- 
gage as is not in immediate use, is already packed up. 

Your accounts of my dear boy please me. Tell him his 
endeavours to gain knowledge, and practise virtue, will 
increase and secure my affection for him. 

Remember me to all the family ; and believe me to be, 

Dear Kate, 
Your affectionate friend and brother,

Ghaillot, near Paris, 7th April, 1784, 

Dear Sir, 

On the 5th inst. Mr, Norris gave me your obliging letter 
of the 2Cth September last. I regret that he did not come 
here sooner, for it will always give me pleasure to have 
opportunities of evincing my esteem and regard for you, 
by attention to those who possess yours. Mr. Carmichael, 
whom I had long expected with the public accounts, did 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 157 

not arrive until the 27th ult. ; when Mr. Ridley had just 
gone to England, and Mr. Barclay, who had been long there, 

was and still is absent. Nothing but the settlement of 
those accounts now detains me here, and a mortifying de- 
tention it is, considering that the best season for being at sea 
is passing away. While I stay, Mr. Norris shall perceive 
that he could have brought few recommendations to me so 
acceptable as yours, and those amiable qualities for which 
you commend him. I wish he may return as uncorrupted 
as he came. Paris is a place better calculated for the im- 
provement of riper years ; and in my opinion, very young 
men should not visit it. Our country has already sent 
some here, who will return the worse for their travels. I 
hope your young friend may escape. If he should, you 
may congratulate him on having made the choice of Her- 
cules, for he will be tempted. On the 1st instant, I received 
your favour of January last, by Colonel Harmar. J flatter 
myself that the delays attending the ratification of the 
treaty will not occasion difficulties ; especially as one of the 
ministers who made the peace is now at the head of the 
British administration. If European commercial restric- 
tions produce unanimity, and tend to raise a national spirit 
in our country, which probably will be the case, I shall 
think them blessings. It is time for us to think and act like 
a sovereign, as well as a free people, and by temperate and 
steady self-respect to command that of other nations. It is 
but too much the fashion to depreciate Congress, and I fear 
that, as well as many other of our new fashions, will cost 
us dear. 

Be pleased to present our compliments to Mrs. Thorn p-. 
son. With great and sincere regard and esteem, 

I am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, 

John' Jay,

TO BENJAMIN VAUGHAN. 

New-York, 2d Sept., 1784. 
Dear Sir, 

The far greater part of my time since my arrival has 
been passed in the country, so that several vessels have 
lately gone to Europe, without letters from me to our 
friends there. 

The health of my family and myself is better than usual, 
and I begin to flatter myself that if you and Mrs. Vaughan 
could enjoy this country in only half the degree that I do, 
you would not greatly regret leaving Old England. I am 
more contented than I expected. Some tilings, it is true, 
are wrong, but more are right. Justice is well adminis- 
tered, offences are rare, and I have never known more 
public tranquillity or private security. Resentments sub- 
side very sensibly, though gradually. I have met with 
whigs and tories at the same table. The spirit of industry 
throughout the country was never greater. The produc- 
tions of the earth abound. Prices have fallen since my 
arrival, though still much higher than formerly, especially 
the wages of mechanics and labourers, which are very ex- 
travagant. House-rent is more than double what it was 
before the war. 

Yours sincerely, 

John Jay.

Albany, October 7th, 1784. 
My Dear Sir, 
I am very unfortunate in my attempts to meet you, but 
hope at last to have better success, and sincerely wish it 
to happen about the middle of next month, when I hope to 
wait upon Congress at their next meeting. 

Until a few days ago, I had no doubt but to hear you 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 159 

had accepted the appointment conferred upon you.* My 
fears, however, have been raised, and with my usual frank- 
ness [ assure you that your refusal could not but be attended 
with very bad circumstances. Setting compliments apart, 
I am sensible of the great injur}' such a denial would cause 
to the public, not only on account of the loss made by the 
United States in your person, but also for other motives. 
I hope you will accepl ; 1 know you must: but in case you 
are not determined. 1 had rather change my plans than not 
to see you before you write to Congress. I wish much to 
hear from you at New- York, where I expect to be about 
the 22d. 

My most affectionate respects wait upon Mrs. Jay. 
With every sentiment of regard and attachment, I have the 
honour to be

Philadelphia, 30th Nov., 17S4. 
Dear Sir, 

A sufficient number of members to form a Congress not 
having arrived at Trenton, I passed on to this place ten 
days ago, to visit my friends. I found your family well, 
and am happy in this opportunity of cultivating their ac- 
quaintance. 

Your obliging letter of the 5th August lately came to 
hand. Accept my thanks for it, and for the pamphlets 
enclosed with it. 

The policy of Britain respecting this country is so repug- 
nant to common sense, that I am sometimes tempted to 
think it must be so ; and the old adage of quos Deus, &c, 
always occurs to me when I reflect on the subject. 

The India business never appeared to me a difficult one.

160 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

Do justice, and all is easy. Cease to treat those unhappy 
nations as slaves, and be content to trade with them as with 
other independent kingdoms. On such an event, advan- 
tageous though fair treaties might be made with them, and 
you might leave, with their consent, force sufficient in cir- 
cumscribed limits, to secure the benefit and observance of 
them. Your tribute, indeed, would be at an end, but it 
ought not to have had a beginning ; and I wish it may ever 
prove a curse to those who impose and exact it in any 
country. 

Our affairs are in such a state as, all circumstances con- 
sidered, might naturally have been expected ; far better 
than many represent them, though not so well as they 
ought to be. 

Congress is convened at Trenton, and I join them to-mor- 
row. In the course of six or eight weeks a judgment may 
be formed of their prevailing sentiments and views. 

It is certain that we are trading at a wild rate ; and it is 
no less true that your people are giving most absurd credits 
to many, who neither have or ought to have any at home. 
This delirium cannot last. Adieu, my dear sir. 

Yours sincerely,

New-York, 19th January, 1785. 

Dear Sir, 

It was not before this morning that I was informed that 
the bearer of this letter was going to France, and to sail to- 
morrow ; and business and company have not till now (late 
in the evening), permitted me to sit down to write to you. 
I cannot, however, omit this opportunity of sending you a 
few lines, which, though not very interesting, will neverthe- 
less evince my attention to a correspondence, from which 
1 promise myself much pleasure as well as much informa- 
tion. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 1G1 

The removal of Congress to this place necessarily occa- 
sioned a suspension of business, and delayed their maturing 
several matters which they had under consideration. They 
have, within a few days past, made a house, and as they 
possess both talents and temper, there is reason to pre- 
sume that the Union will derive advantage from their 
measures. 

Advices from Kentucky inform us that they are threatened 
with an Indian war ; and there is some room to conjecture 
that such an event would not be disagreeable to our western 
neighbours, who, if they do interfere, will certainly be more 
cunning than wise. That settlement increases with a degree 
of rapidity heretofore unknown in this country, and increase 
it will, notwithstanding any attempt of anybody to pre- 
vent it. 

Federal ideas begin to thrive in this city, and I suspect 
in a few days to communicate to you a circumstance which 
will strongly manifest it. 

Although we cannot be immediately interested in the 
war, w r hich it is thought will take place between the emperor 
and the Dutch, yet we may be affected by its consequences, 
and, therefore, must wish to know who will, and who will 
not, probably take sides with this or that party, in case of a 
rupture. 

Have we any reason to flatter ourselves that you will 
encourage us to drink your wines, by permitting your islands 
to eat our bread ? or will Bordeaux (as is said) constrain 
Versailles to patronise a provincial monopoly at the expense 
of a more liberal policy ? Commercial privileges, granted 
to us by France, at this season of British ill-humour, would 
be particularly grateful; and afford conclusive evidence 
against its being the plan of the two kingdoms to restrain 
our trade to the islands. You know how uneasy we are 
under these restraints, and we confide fully in your exertions 
to remove them. I write very freely, but you are my

to DR. RUSH. 

New-York, 24th March, 1785. 

Sir, 

Such has been the state of my official business, and of 
that which arose from my long neglected private affairs, 
that, ever since the removal of Congress to this place, I 
have been obliged to trespass on my usual punctuality in 
private correspondences. Hence it happened that I have 
so long denied myself the pleasure of replying to your 
friendly letter of the 10th of January. Accept my warmest 
acknowledgments for the kind and very obliging manner in 
which you mention my services abroad, and permit me to 
congratulate you on the success of the application to Con- 
gress on behalf of Dickinson College, which you appear 
zealously to patronise. I consider knowledge to be the 
soul of a republic ; and as the weak and the wicked are 
generally in alliance, as much care should be taken to 
diminish the number of the former, as of the latter. Edu- 
cation is the way to do this, and nothing should be left 
undone to afford all ranks of people the means of obtaining 
a proper degree of it, at a cheap and easy rate. 

I thank you for the pamphlet you sent me. There is 
good sense and just reasoning in it. I wish to see all unjust 
and unnecessary discriminations everywhere abolished; 
and that the time may soon come when all our inhabitants, 
of every colour and denomination, shall be free and equal 
partakers of our political liberty. 

I am, sir, with great respect and esteem, 

Your most obedient servant, 

John Jay.

Dear Sir, 
I have the honour of transmitting to you herewith en-

instant, instructing you to communicate to Mr. St. Saphorin 
the high sense the United States, in Congress assembled, 
entertain of the liberal decision made by his Danish ma-

Congress has been pleased to order me to transmit copies

they will receive with pleasure this mark of your attention,

always give me pleasure to acknowledge the friendly atten- 
tion which has so long marked your conduct towards me 
and my family. In both capacities, therefore, I shall be 
happy to give you better evidence of my esteem and 
regard, than compliments or professions can possibly 
afford. 

Mr. Morris's resignation is a great loss to this country, 
and yet I am not without hopes that the department of 
finance will become properly arranged. The nature of our 
governments, as well as the circumstance of their being 
new, exposes our operations to delay, and renders the best 
systems slow in forming, as well as slow in executing. In 
my opinion, one superintendent or commissioner of the 
treasury is preferable to any greater number of them ; 
indeed, I would rather have each department under the 
direction of one able man, than of twenty able ones. All 
things, however, in this world, have their bright as well as 
their dark sides ; and there are few systems so imperfect 
as not to have some conveniences. Many reasons induce 
me to disapprove of committing the treasury to the manage- 
ment of three persons ; and yet one very great convenience 
results from it, viz., that our jealous republicans will have 
more confidence in three gentlemen coming from different 
parts of the continent, than they would place in any one 
single man. Confidence, you know, is always followed by 
credit, and credit is the forerunner of money. 

I am, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

John Jay.

Paris, Oct. 16th, 1784. 

Dear Sir, 

I have just heard that a French packet is on the point of 
departure for New-York. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 165 

I cannot permit it to sail without forwarding you a few 
lines expressive of the pleasure I received on hearing of 
your safe arrival. 

The services you have rendered your country will 
naturally secure you a very welcome reception. 

The only circumstance that can be productive of dis- 
agreeable sensations is the situation of your State, exposed 
to such political convulsions. However, I hope it will soon 
be restored to harmony and good- tern per. 

I hope your public appointment will prove an agreeable 
surprise to you on your arrival, and that you will be able to 
reconcile the acceptance of it to every consideration of 
private interest and convenience, as well as public duty. 

The British seem to recede every day more and more 
from the paths to conciliation. A certain nation, to whom 
we are indebted for political favours, will endeavour to 
cherish this disposition, as she is sure to benefit by such 
growing feuds and divisions. 

From the observations I have made since my arrival 
here, I can discover the necessity of very complying con- 
duct on the part of those Americans who have public busi- 
ness to transact with this court. 

Such conformity to the opinions of others is not easily 
reconcilable to the feelings and manly deportment of re- 
publicans. 

No one is better acquainted than you are with the sys- 
tem of this court, and no one is more jealous of their coun- 
try's honour, in essential points. 

You may well imagine, then, that your appointment was 
not regarded with satisfaction, nor will the congratulations 
that you will receive on it from certain persons be sincere. 

With great esteem and regard, believe me to be, 

Dear sir, 
Your sincere friend and obedient humble servant, 

William Bingham.

TO WILLIAM BINGHAM. 

New-York, 31st May, 1785. 
Dear Sir, 

I have been favoured with yours of the 12th February, 
containing a copy of one of 16th October last, for which 
accept my cordial thanks. 

Your observations in France, respecting a certain event, 
coincide exactly with what I expected on that subject. In- 
deed, the many interesting remarks spread through your 
letter appear to me to have weight. 

Our last accounts give us reason to suppose there will 
be no war between the emperor and the Dutch, so that the 
continuance of a general peace begins again to appear 
probable. 

Our frontier posts still have British garrisons, and we are 
impatient to hear why they are not. evacuated. Mr. Adams, 
I suppose, is by this time in London ; his letters will remove 
our suspense on that head. 

The African states have alarmed us, but we hope peace 
with them may be obtained. Your attention to that subject 
is commendable, and you may do good by communicating 
the result of your inquiries to Mr. Adams. 

Our affairs are settling by degrees into order. If power 
be given by Congress to regulate trade, and provide for the 
payment of their debts, all will be well. Difficulties on 
those points still exist, but federal ideas daily gain ground. 
The people of Boston resent British restrictions ; and if 
the same spirit should become general, it will probably in- 
fluence the States to enable Congress to retaliate, and ex- 
tend their powers accordingly. 

The Empress of China has made a fortunate voyage ; 
and it is said many are preparing to embark in that com- 
merce. The spirit of enterprise and adventure runs high 
in our young country, and if properly directed by a vigorous 
and wise federal government, would produce great effects.

A rage for emigrating to the western country prevails,

Office for Foreign Affairs, 2 
15th July, 17S5. \ 

Dear Sir, 

Accept my thanks for your interesting letter of the 19th 
March, which was immediately communicated to Congress. 
I consider it as a new proof of that constant and useful 
attention to our affairs, from which the United States have 
so often derived both pleasure and advantage. Let me 
request the continuance of your correspondence, and be 
assured that it will always give me pleasure to communi- 
cate to you such intelligence respecting American occur- 
rences as may appear interesting. 

Don Diego Gardoqui is arrived, and has been received 
so much in the spirit of friendship, that 1 hope his master 
and himself will be well pleased. Our negotiations with 
him will soon commence, and I sincerely wish that the 
issue of them may be satisfactory to both countries. To 
prepare for war, and yet be tenacious of peace with all the 
wwld, is, I think, our true interest. I wish Mr. Gardoqui's 
instructions may be sufficiently extensive to admit of a set- 
tlement of our boundaries, &c, on principles which alone 
can create and perpetuate cordiality. 

The British show no disposition to evacuate our frontier 
posts. What their real designs are, can at present be only 
inferred and conjectured from appearances ; and present 



168 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

appearances induce a suspicion that they mean to hold 
them. The letters we expect from Mr. Adams will pro- 
bably remove all doubts on that head. It is certain that 
they pay great attention to the Indians, and give great en- 
couragement to emigrants from us. Their expectations 
from the latter circumstance will fail them. I wish that 
every acre of ground they hold in America was settled by 
natives of the United States. They would transplant their 
love of liberty, their spirit of enterprise, and their attach- 
ment to republicanism into countries in which it is our 
interest that such plants should be propagated and flourish ; 
in time they will bear fruit. 

The commercial class of our people sensibly feel the 
restraints on our trade, and look up to Congress for a 
remedy. Good will come out of evil ; these discontents 
nourish federal ideas. As trade diminishes, agriculture 
must suffer ; and hence it will happen that our yeomen will 
be as desirous of increasing the powers of Congress, as our 
merchants now are. All foreign restrictions, exclusions, and 
unneighbourly ordinances will tend to press us together, 
and strengthen our bands of union. 

I send you herewith a number of gazettes, from which 
you will discern something of the spirit which prevails. 

Congress go on doing business with great concord, 
temper, and harmony. I enclose a copy of the ordinance 
for regulating the Land Office. They are now on the sub- 
ject of requisitions ; and I flatter myself, that as the highest 
respect for good faith prevails in the House, that exertions 
will be made by the States to preserve the public credit. 

Governor Livingston was appointed for the Hague, but 
declining that place, Gov. Rutledge has been elected for it.

from thence. The report of Mons. De Montiers coming

to marchioness de la fayette. 

New-York, 13th Aug., 1785. 
Madam, 

I have received the letter which you did me the honour 
to write on the 15th April last. Few circumstances could 
have given me more pleasure than such evidence of my 
having a place in the remembrance and good opinion of a 
ladv, whose esteem derives no less value from her discern- 
ment, than from the delicacy of her sentiments. 

Accept therefore, madam, of my sincere and cordial 
acknowledgments for honouring me with a place among 
your correspondents ; which was the more obliging, as you 
was to afford more pleasure by, than you could expect to 
receive from it. You know it is an old observation, that 
ladies write better letters than gentlemen, and therefore, 
independent of other considerations, a correspondence be- 
tween them is always so far on unequal terms. 

I can easily conceive that you, whose predilection for 
your husband was always conspicuous, should experience 
so much satisfaction on seeing him return from this, his field 
of glory, with additional honours ; and I can, with equal 
ease, form an idea of his emotions, when on that, as on 
former occasions, those honours promoted him to higher 
rank in your estimation. 

Your remarks on the marquis's affection for his children, 
and the value you set on domestic enjoyments, must be 
pleasing to those who are capable of feeling their force. 

I assure you I rejoice in the prospect you have of ex- 
tending, through your branch, the reputation of both your 
families ; and you have my best wishes, that the latest his-

torian may say of your descendants, that all the men were 
as valiant and worthy as their ancestor, who will probably 
be distinguished by the appellation of Americanus, and all 
the women as virtuous and amiable as his lady. 

If you was not what you are, I would not encourage the 
desire you express of accompanying the marquis on his 
next visit to this country, for I am sure you would be dis- 
appointed. 

We have few amusements to relieve travellers of that 
weight of time and leisure which oppresses many of them. 
Our men, for the most part, mind their business, and our 
women their families ; and if our wives succeed (as most 
of them do) in " making home man's best delight," gallantry 
seldom draws their husbands from them. 

Our customs, in many respects, differ from yours, and 
you know that, whether with or without reason, we usually 
prefer those which education and habit recommend. The 
pleasures of Paris and the pomp of Versailles are unknown 
in this country, and their votaries must unavoidably expe- 
rience a certain vacuity or blank here, which nothing but 
good sense, moderate desires, and a relish for less splendid, 
less various, but not less innocent or satisfactory enjoyments 
can supply. Though not a Frenchman, I should, never- 
theless, be too polite to tell these things to those whom they 
might restrain from visiting us. Cn you they will have a 
contrary effect. It would gratify the friends of the mar- 
quis, viz., the citizens of the United States, to have the 
honour of a visit from you. I flatter myself that consider- 
ation will afford a strong additional inducement. 

My little family is well. Mrs. Jay desires me to assure 
you of her remembrance and regard ; and permit me to 
add, that I am, with sincere esteem and respectful attach- 
ment, 

Madam, your most obedient, and 

Very humble servant, 

John Jay. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 171 



TO JOHN ADAMS, LONDON. 

Office for Foreign Affairs, 
6th .Sept., 1785. 

Dear Sir, 

The frequent solecisms, observable for some years past 
in the politics of the court of London, render it exceedingly 
difficult to divine how they will think and act under almost 
any given circumstances. 

It is manifestly as much their interest to be well with us, 
as it is ours to be well with them ; and yet the gratification 
of resentments, occasioned by disappointment, seems to take 
the lead of more elevated and useful principles of action. 

They expect much from the trade of America, and yet 
they take pains to cut off every source within their reach 
by which we may make remittances. It is strange that 
they should wish us to buy, and yet be so industrious to put 
it out of our power to pay. Such a system must cause 
loss of money to their merchants, and loss of reputation to 
ours. I wish most sincerely that credit was at an end, and 
that we could purchase nothing abroad but for ready 
money. Our exportations would then be equally profitable, 
and as our importations would be diminished, we should 
have less to pay. Domestic manufactures would then be 
more encouraged, and frugality and economy become more 
prevalent. 

What impression the conduct of Captain Stanhope may 
make on the minister, to me appears uncertain. Certain 
however it is, that mutual civility and respect must, in the 
nature of things, precede mutual benevolence and kindness. 
The manner of your reception and treatment indicates 
their attention to this consideration, and yet the detention 
of the posts, the strengthening their garrisons in our neigh- 
bourhood, the encouragement said to be given to settlers in 
those parts, and various other circumstances speak a lan- 
guage very different from that of kindness and good-will. 



172 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

They may hold the posts, but they will hold them as 
pledges of enmity ; and the time must and will come, 
when the seeds of discontent, resentment, and hatred, 
which such measures always sow, will produce very bitter 
fruit. 

I am well informed that some of the loyalists advise and 
warmly press the detention of the posts. It is strange that 
men, who for ten years have done nothing but deceive, 
should still retain any credit. I speak of them collectively, 
among them there are men of merit : but to my knowledge 
some of the most violent, the most bitter and implacable, 
and yet most in credit, are men who endeavoured to play 
between both parties, and vibrated from side to side as the 
appearance of success attracted them. Nay, the very 
accounts of losses which many of them have presented, 
afford conclusive evidence of their inattention to truth and 
common decency. Such, however, has been the infatuation 
of British counsels, that what was manifest to others, was 
problematical, if not entirely dark to them. 

As to their present minister, he has neither been long 
enough in administration, nor perhaps in the world, for a 
decided judgment to be formed either of his private or 
public character. He seems to possess firmness as well as 
abilities ; and if to these be added information, and com- 
prehensive as well as patriotic views, he may be worthy of 
his father. England will probably be either much the bet- 
ter, or much the worse for him. 

We are anxious to receive letters from you on the sub- 
ject of the posts, that in either event we may be prepared. 
In the one case, I should think it very justifiable in Con- 
gress to take a certain step, that would be longer and more 
sensibly felt by Britain than the independence of these 
States.

Upon your safe return to your native country, after a

It gave me great pleasure to hear of your appointment

I hope my letter, in answer to the one which enclosed a

time. I do not recollect the date, but it went in one of the 
last vessels. 



174 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

The cause of liberty, like most other good causes, will 
have its difficulties, and sometimes its persecutions, to 
struggle with. It has advanced more rapidly in this than 
other countries, but all its objects are not yet attained ; and 
I much doubt whether they ever will be, in this or any 
other terrestrial state. That men should pray and fight for 
their own freedom, and yet keep others in slavery, is cer- 
tainly acting a very inconsistent, as well as unjust and, 
perhaps, impious part ; but the history of mankind is filled 
with instances of human improprieties. The wise and the 
good never form the majority of any large society, and it 
seldom happens that their measures are uniformly adopted ; 
or that they can always prevent being overborne themselves 
by the strong and almost never-ceasing union of the wicked 
and the weak. 

These circumstances tell us to be patient, and to moderate 
those sanguine expectations, which warm and good hearts 
often mislead even wise heads to entertain on those subjects. 
All that the best men can do is, to persevere in doing their 
duty to their country, and leave the consequences to Him 
who made it their duty ; being neither elated by success, 
however great, nor discouraged by disappointments how- 
ever frequent and mortifying. 

With sincere esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

John Jay.

Dear Sir, 
Your grandson, whom it gave me great pleasure to see, 
delivered to me a few days ago your kind letter of the 21st 
of last month. Your being again with your family, the 
manner in which the French court parted with you, the 
attention you experienced from your English friends, and 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 175 

the reception you met with from your fellow-citizens, are 
circumstances that must give you great satisfaction. 

It strikes me that you will find it somewhat difficult to 
manage the two parties in Pennsylvania. It is much to be 
wished that union and harmony may be established there, 
and if you accomplish it. much honour and many blessings 
will result from it. Unless you do it, I do not know who 
can ; for, independent of experience and talents, you possess 
their confidence, and your advice and measures must derive 
very great weight from the reputation and consideration 
you enjoy. 

We are happy to find that you think of visiting New- 
York. By the road from Burlington and Amboy, which is 
smooth and but short, you might doubtless come with very 
little inconvenience ; especially as you may travel at your 
leisure, and take as many days for it as your ease and the 
weather may require. Mrs. Jay is exceedingly pleased 
with this idea, and sincerely joins with me in wishing to see 
it realized. Her attachments are strong, and that to you, 
being founded in esteem and the recollection of kind offices, 
is particularly so. I suspect your little friend has forgotten 
your person. Your name is familiar to her, as, indeed, it 
will be to every generation. 

With the best wishes, I am, dear sir, 

Your obliged and affectionate servant, 

John Jay.

Dear Sir, 
Since the date of my last to you, which was the 6th Sep- 
tember last, I have been honoured with yours of the 10th 
and 26th June, and 19th and 29th July, with the papers 
mentioned to be enclosed. They are now before Congress, 
and I am persuaded that the strong marks they bear of 
industry and attention will give them pleasure. 



176 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

I perfectly concur with you in sentiment respecting what 
ought to be the conduct and policy of the United States, 
and I am not without hopes that they will gradually per- 
ceive and pursue their true interests. There certainly is 
much temper as well as talents in Congress ; and although 
it is not in their power to do all that should be done, yet 
they are willing and industrious to do whatever depends 
upon them. 

Your letters, I am sure, are useful. They disseminate 
and enforce those federal ideas which cannot be too forci- 
bly inculcated, or too strongly impressed. Our federal gov- 
ernment is incompetent to its objects ; and as it is the inter- 
est of our country, so it is the duty of her leading charac- 
ters to co-operate in measures for enlarging and invigora- 
ting it. The rage for separations and new States is mis- 
chievous ; it will, unless checked, scatter our resources, and 
in every view enfeeble the Union. Your testimony against 
such licentious, anarchical proceedings would, I am per- 
suaded, have great weight. 

Your letters, as yet, are silent respecting the evacuation 
of our frontier posts. I do not mean to press you either to 
do or say any thing unseasonably about it ; for there are 
times and tides in human affairs to be watched and observed. 
I know vour attention, and therefore rest satisfied that we 
shall hear from you on this interesting subject as soon as 
you ought to write about it. During the ensuing sessions 
of the Legislatures, I shall watch their acts, and endeavour 
to send you such as may respect the interests of the Union. 
I find it extremely difficult to collect them. When I first 
came into this office, I wrote a circular letter to the gov- 
ernors, requesting them, among other things, to send me, 
from time to time, printed copies of their acts ; but, what- 
ever may have been the cause, it has so happened that, 
except in two or three instances, this request has been 
entirelv neglected. 

With the newspapers herewith sent, you will find the 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDED E. 177 

requisition of Congress. What its success will be cannot 
yet be determined. 

Tim Algerines, it seems, have declared war against us. 
If we act properly, I shall not be wry sorry for it. In my 
opinion, it may lay the foundation for a navy, and tend to 
draw ns more closely into a federal system. Onthatground 
only we wain strength; and could our people be brought 
to see it in that light, ami act accordingly, we should have 
little reason to apprehend danger from any quarter. 

Dr. Franklin is happy at Philadelphia. Both parties are 
assiduous in their attentions to him, and it is thought more 
than probable that he will succeed Mr. Dickinson. I fear, 
in the language of our farmers, that a day so remarkably 
fine for the season may prove a weather-breeder : that is, 
that he will find it difficult to manage both parties; for if 
he gives himself up to one, he must expect hostility from the 
other. I wish he may be able to reconcile them, and thereby 
restore that State to the degree of strength and respecta- 
bility which, from its population, fertility, and commerce, it 
ought to possess. 

With great and sincere esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

John Jay.

Dear Sik, 

My last to you was of the 14th ult., by the ship Betsey, 
Captain Thomas Watson. Since that time, I have had the 
pleasure of receiving and laying before Congress your 
despatches of the 6th, 8th, and 10th August last. 

We concur so perfectly in sentiment respecting public 
allairs, and what ought to be done, that I find no occasion 
to enlarge on those heads. 

VOL. II. L 



178 LIFE OP JOHN JAY. 

In a late report, I have called the attention of Congress 
to this serious question, viz. whether the United States 
should withdraw their attention from the ocean, and leave 
foreigners to fetch and carry for them, or whether it is more 
their interest to look forward to naval strength and mari- 
time importance, and to take and persevere in the measures 
proper to attain it. 

The diversity of opinions on this point renders it neces- 
sary that it should be well considered, and finally decided. 
The eastern and middle States are generally for the latter 
system ; and though the others do not openly avow their 
preferring the former, yet they are evidently inclined to it. 
Hence it is that the most leading men in Congress from 
that quarter do not only not promote measures for vesting 
Congress with power to regulate trade, but, as the common 
phrase is, throw cold water on all such ideas. 

Having few or no ships of their own, they are averse to 
such duties on foreign ones as will greatly advance the 
price of freight ; nor do they seem much disposed to sacri- 
fice any present profits for the sake of their neighbours who 
have ships and wish to have more. 

We have heard much of the Alsrerines havinsr declared 
war against the United States. None of our advices are 
official ; but as the intelligence comes directly from Nantes, 
Bordeaux, and L'Orient, there seems to be much reason to 
fear it is true. 

The public papers herewith sent will inform you of our 
common occurrences ; and I wish it was in my power to 
tell you what Congress mean to do respecting many matters 
on which they are to decide. The representation is at pres- 
ent slender, and will, I suspect, continue so till the new 
members come on. 

I have the honour to be 

Your very obedient servant, 
John Jay. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 179 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Office for Foreign Affairs, 
24th -Nov., 1785. 

Sir, 

Mr. Temple presented to me this morning the commis- 
sion which I have now the honour of transmitting to your 
excellency herewith enclosed. It appoints him consul- 
general of his Britannic majesty, throughout the United 
States of America. 

Two questions arise on this occasion : 

1. Whether he is to be received de jure. 

2. Whether it will be expedient to receive him de gratia. 
The first question is settled by Vattel in the following 

paragraph, viz., 

"Among the modern institutions," &c, page 131. 

The second question appears to me to be an important 
one, for however determined, interesting consequences will 
result from its decision. In considering it, a secondary 
question presents itself, viz. whether the rejection or recep- 
tion of this consul will most dispose his nation to the terms 
of commercial intercourse which we wish. To this point, 
the fable of the north wind and the sun seems applicable. 

It appears to me that the admission of a consul here is 
not a matter of so much importance to Britain, as to induce 
that nation to purchase or obtain it by any compliances 
which they would not olherivisc make. Severity, or sum- 
mum jus on small points, may irritate, but they very 
seldom coerce. Retaliatory restrictions on trade and navi- 
gation are great objects, and very consistent with the pride 
and dignity, as well as interest of a nation ; but under such 
ideas to refuse to receive a consul, would, whatever might 
be the true motives, be generally ascribed to a degree of 
pique and irritation, which, though nations may feel, they 
ought not expressly or impliedly to declare. 

In my opinion, therefore, this consul ought to be received,

but in such a manner as to be and to appear as a matter 
of favour, and not ns a matter of course. 
I have the honour to be, 

Your excellency's most obedient

TO THOMAS JEFFERSON, 

Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States at the court of France. 

Office for Foreign Affairs, ) 
N.Y., 19th Jan., 1786. £ 

Dear Sir. 

Since my last of 7th December last, and indeed for some 
time before that, Congress has been composed of so few 
States actually represented, as not to have it in their power 
to pay that attention to their foreign affairs which they 
would doubtless have otherwise' done. Hence it has hap- 
pened that no resolutions have been entered into on any of 
the important subjects submitted to their consideration. 
This obliges me to observe a degree of reserve in my let- 
ters respecting those subjects, which I wish to be free from, 
but which is nevertheless necessary, lest my sentiments and 
opinions should be opposed to those which they may adopt 
and wish to impress. 

There is reason to hope that the requisition will be gene- 
rally complied with ; I say generally, because it is not quite 
clear that every State without exception will make punc- 
tual payments. Although a disposition prevails to enable 
Congress to regulate trade, yet 1 am apprehensive, that 
however the propriety of the measure may be admit- 
ted, the manner of doing it will not be with equal ease 
agreed to. 

It is much to be regretted, that the confederation had not 
been so formed as to exclude the necessity of all such kind 
of questions. It certainly is very imperfect, and I fear it 
will be difficult to remedy its defects, until experience

shall render the necessity of doing it more obvious and 
pressing. 

With great respect I have the honour to be, 

Dear sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

John Jay. 



TO JOHN ADAMS, LONDON. 

.New- York, 22d Feb., 1786. 

Dear Sir, 

Nine States are not yet represented in Congress, and 
therefore the affairs of this department continue in the 
same state that they were in at the date of my last. 

The public papers will enable you to see the complexion 
of the times. Federal opinions grow, but it will be some time 
befure thev will bear fruit; and, what is not the case with 
most other fruits, they will, to judge from present appear- 
ances, ripen slower in the south than in the north. 

The packet will sail next week. I shall then write to 
you ao'ain. 

With great and sincere esteem and regard, I have the 
honour to be, dear sir, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

John Jay. 

to mr. lushington. 

ZS'ew-York, loth March, 1776. 

Sir, 

I have been favoured with your letter of the 22d ult., 
and hnmediatelv communicated it to the committee of our 
society for promoting the liberation of slaves, and protect- 
ing such as may be manumitted. They are taking proper 
measures on the occasion, and I flatter myself that our 
Legislature will interpose to prevent such enormities in 
future. 

It is much to be wished that slavery may be abolished. 



182 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

The honour of the States, as well as justice and humanity, 
in my opinion, loudly call upon them to emancipate these 
unhappy people. To contend for our own liberty, and to 
deny that blessing to others, involves an inconsistency not 
to be excused. 

Whatever may be the issue of the endeavours of you 
and others to promote this desirable end, the reflection that 
they are prompted by the best motives affords good reasons 
for persevering in them. 

I am, sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

John Jay. 

to lord lansdown, london. 

New-York, 16th April, 1786. 

My Lord, 

Accept my thanks for the letter you did me the honour 
to write on the 4th September last, and for your obliging 
interposition in behalf of the person alluded to in it. 

Your lordship's conjectures respecting the new principles 
of trade and finance will probably be realized. We hear 
of several circumstances which look and promise well. 
The extent of those principles, and the system of com- 
merce to be reared on them, are subjects, however, on 
which no decided judgment can here be formed, for want 
of information more minute and unquestionable than we at 
present have. 

Various, my lord, are the conjectures of this country re- 
specting the real disposition and intentions of yours on these 
and some other interesting points. While such doubts and 
apprehensions exist, a degree of jealousy will naturally con- 
tinue to operate against mutual confidence. For my part, 
I sincerely wish to see good-humour prepare the way for 
friendly intercourse, and by degrees incline both countries 
rather to promote than retard each other's welfare. It 
gives me pleasure to reflect that our wishes on this head 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 183 

correspond, and that the time may yet come when your 
abilities and liberality will produce all the public benefits 
which may justly he expected from them. Mr. Pitt's 
views, as to America, are yet to be ascertained : I wish 
they may be such as to increase the reputation and affection 
which his father's memory enjoys among us. It strikes me 
that a minister of any nation, much connected with this, 
will always find advantage in possessing the esteem and 
confidence of America. 

To what events this country may in future be instru- 
mental, is indeed uncertain ; but I cannot persuade myself 
that Providence has created such a nation, in such a coun- 
try, to remain like dust in the balance of others. We are 
happy, my lord, in the enjoyment of much more interior 
tranquillity than the English newspapers allow, or their 
writers seem to wish us. In free states, there must and 
ought to be a little ferment. When the public mind grows 
languid, and a doad calm, unmarked by the least breeze of 
party takes place, the vigour of a republic soon becomes 
lost in general relaxation. We perhaps are yet too distant 
from that point ; for although our laws and manners now 
give us as much personal security as can elsewhere be 
found, and although the same may in a great, though less 
degree be said of our property, yet our federal government 
has imperfections, which time and more experience will, I 
hope, effectually remedy. 

I have the honour to be, my lord, with great respect and 
esteem, your lordship's 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

John Jay. 

to lord lansdown. 

New-York, 20th April, 1736. 

My Lord, 

Mr. Ansley this morning delivered the letter you did me 
the honour to write on the 26th of February last. Every 
opportunity of manifesting my attention to your lordship's 



184 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

recommendations will give me pleasure, and that induce' 
ment will conspire, with others of a public nature, to ensure 
to Mr. Ansley my friendly endeavours to facilitate the exe- 
cution of his commission, and render his residence here 
agreeable to him. 

I perfectly agree in sentiment with your lordship, that it 
much concerns the honour and future intercourse of both 
countries to have the treaty of peace duly and faithfully 
executed. It 'is to be lamented that wars like the last 
usually leave behind them a degree of heat which requires 
some time and prudence to allay. Minds like yours will 
not be susceptible of it, but the mass of the people commonly 
act and reason as they feel, and have seldom sufficient tem- 
per and liberality to perceive that peace should draw a veil 
over the injuries of war, and that when hostilities cease, no 
other contest should remain, but that of who shall take the 
lead in magnanimity and manly policy. Although these 
remarks apply to both countries, yet, whatever may be said 
or written to the contrary, there is certainly, my lord, 
more temper in this country than it has credit for ; and J 
am persuaded it would become more manifest, if less 
discouraged by irritating proceedings here and abroad. In 
the Legislature of this State there are this day members 
sitting, who, it is well known, are disqualified by law for 
their conduct during the late contest ; and an act has lately 
passed for restoring all such of the gentlemen of the law 
as, for the same reason, had been suspended from the exer- 
cise of their profession. The execution of all law r s of this 
sort becomes more and more relaxed, and of the many per- 
sons returned to this State from exile, and living in their 
former neighbourhoods, I have not heard of one that has 
met with any molestation. There are, indeed, certain char- 
acters who can never return with safety ; but the greater 
part of them are such as merit no other attention from 
any country than what national policy may exact. With 
respect to the generality of these people, the public mind 
daily becomes more and more composed. It is true that 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 185 

our affairs arc not yel perfectly arranged; some former 
acts are to be done away, and mure proper regulations to 
be introduced. There is reason, however, to hope that 
things will gradually come right, and I am persuaded that 
a little more good-nature on the part of Britain, would pro- 
duce solid and mutual advantages to both countries. 

My lord. I write thus freely from a persuasion that your 
ideas of policy are drawn from those large and liberal views 
and principles, which apply to the future as well as the 
present, and which embrace the interests of the nation and 
of mankind, rather than the local and transitory advantages 
of partial systems and individual ambition; for your lord- 
ship's plans on the peace were certainly calculated to make 
the revolution produce only an exchange of dependence for 
friendship, and of sound and feathers for substance and per- 
manent benefits. How greatly would it redound to the 
happiness as well as honour of all civilized people, were 
they to consider and t. ach other like fellow-citizens; 

each nation governing itself as it pleases, but each admit- 
ting others to a perfect freedom of commerce. The bless-' 
ings resulting from the climate and local advantages of one 
countrv would then become common to all, and the boun- 
ties of nature and conveniences of art pass from nation to 
nation, without being impeded by the selfish monopolies and 
restrictions, with which narrow policy opposes the extension 
of Divine benevolence. It is pleasant, my lord, to dream 
of these things, and I often enjoy that pleasure ; but though, 
like some of our other dreams, we may wish to see them 
realized, yet the passions and prejudices of mankind forbid 
us to expect it. 

I have the honour to be, with great respect and sincere 
regard, my lord, 

Your lordship's mosl obedient 

And very humble servant, 

John Jay.

186 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 



TO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE, PARIS. 

New-York, 10th June, 1786. 
Dear Sir, 

During your absence from France, I omitted being so 
regular in my correspondence as I should otherwise have 
been. I have been honoured with your letters of the 18th 
April, and 6th September in the last year, and with one of 
11th February last. They were all communicated to Con- 
gress. 

The account of your German excursion is concise and 
interesting. The sentiments and opinions respecting the 
United States and American affairs, which you found there 
prevailing, appear to me very natural. Successful revolu- 
tions and victorious arms have always a degree of splendour 
about them, which shines at a great distance, and excites 
admiration, whether well or ill founded. Few have been 
at the pains of examining and understanding the merits of 
the case between Great Britain and us, and nine-tenths of 
that few have taken their sides less from conviction and 
opinion of right, than from some of the many other more 
common and more stimulating motives, which usually gov- 
ern the declarations and conduct of the mass of mankind. 
It is equally natural that reports to our disadvantage, com- 
posed of such proportions of truth and falsehood as might 
render them probable and palatable, should be generally 
diffused and believed. There are very few States, and 
very few ministers in them, who think it convenient to 
magnify America either by word or deed. Politicians, like 
critics, are often more disposed to censure than to com- 
mend the works of others, and patriotic manoeuvres pro 
bono publico, like pious frauds pro salute animarum, were 
never uncommon. As there is, and always was, and will 
be, an actual though involuntary coalition between the men 
of too much art, and the men of too little; so they who 
either officially or from choice fabricate opinions for other 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 187 

people's use, will always find many to receive and be in- 
fluenced by them. Thus, errors proceeding from the in- 
vention of designing men, are very frequently adopted and 
cherished by others who mistake them for truths. It must 
be easy for the maritime nations to make the rest of Europe 
believe almost what they please of this country for some 
years yet to come, and I shall be much mistaken if fame 
should soon do us justice, especially as her trumpet is, in 
many places, employed and hired for other purposes. 

Whence it happens, I know not, but so the fact is, that I 
have scarcely met with six foreigners in the course of my 
life, who really understood American affairs. The cause 
of truth will probably be little indebted to their memoirs 
and representations ; and when I consider what mis- 
takes arc committed by writers on American subjects, I 
suspect the histories of other countries contain but very 
imperfect accounts of them. 

I can easily conceive that, at the German courts you 
visited, you have done us service ; because I know how 
able, as well as how willing, you are to do it. I wish all 
who speak and write of us were equally well-informed and 
well-disposed. It is a common remark in this country, 
that wherever you go, you do us good. For my part, I 
give you credit, not merely for doing us good, but also for 
doing it uniformly, constantly, and upon system. 

Do you recollect your letter of the 2d March, 1783, con- 
taining what passed between you and Count de Florida 
Blanca, respecting our western limits? I communicated 
that part of it some months ago to Mr. Gardoqui, in oppo- 
sition to his pretensions and claims. He lately told me 
you had mistaken the count, for that he never meant to con- 
vey to you any thing like a dereliction of those claims : 
which, by-the-bye, are too extensive to be admitted. In a 
word, they do not mean to be restricted to the limits estab- 
lished between Britain and us. Why should people, who 



188 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

have so much more territory than they know what to do 
with, he so solicitous to acquire more? 

The moneys due by the United States to subjects of 
France have given occasion to applications by Mr. Mar- 
bois, and to reports on them by the board of treasury, 
which are now under the consideration of Congress. You, 
my dear sir, are not unacquainted with the state of our 
finances, nor with the difficulties resulting from the ineffi- 
ciency of our federal government. Time and more expe- 
rience must and will cure these evils; when or how is less 
certain, and can only be conjectured. 

I had the honour, last summer, of writing a letter to the 
marchioness, in answer to one she was so obliging as to 
favour me with ; did it ever come to hand? Mrs. Jay 
writes to her by this conveyance. We and many others 
are pleased with the expectation of seeing you both here, 
and with the opportunity we shall then have of personally 
assuring you of our esteem and attachment. 

1 am, dear sir, 
Your all'ectionate and obedient servant, 

John Jay. 

to thomas jefferson, paris. 

New-York, 14th July, 1786. 

Dear Sir, 

Since my last to you of the 16th ultimo, I have been 
honoured with your letter of 23d, and a joint one from you 
and Mr. Adams, of 25th April. 

Considering the importance of our commerce with Por- 
tugal, it gives me pleasure to learn that a treaty with that 
kingdom was so nearly concluded. Until our affairs shall 
be more perfectly arranged, we shall treat under disadvan- 
tages ; and therefore I am not surprised that our negotia- 
tions with Britain and Barbary are unpromising. To be 
respectable abroad, it is necessary to be so at home ; and 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 189 

that will not be the case until our public faith acquires more 

confidence, and our g >vermnenl more strength. 

When or how these greai objects will be attained, can 
scarcely be conjectured. An uneasiness prevails through 
the country, and may produce eventually the desired reform- 
ations, and it may also produce untoward events. Time 
alone can decide this and many other doubts; for nations, 
like individuals, are more frequently guided by circum- 
stances, than circumstances by them. 

There are some little circumstances that look as if the 
Dutch regret our having found the way to China ; and that 
will doubtless be more or less the case with every nation 
with whose commercial views we may interfere. I am 
happy in reflecting, that there can be but little clashing of 
interests between us and France, and therefore that she 
will probably continue disposed to wish us well and do us 
good ; especially, if we honestly fulfil our pecuniary engage- 
ments with her. These engagements, however, give me 
much concern. Every principle and consideration of 
honour, justice, and interest calls upon us for good faith and 
punctuality; and yet we are unhappily so circumstanced, 
that the moneys necessary for the purpose are not provided, 
nor in such a way of being provided as they ought to be. 
This is owing, not to any thing wrong in Congress, but to 
their not possessing that power of coercion without which 
no government can possibly attain the most salutary and 
constitutional objects. Excuses and palliations, and appli- 
cations for more time, make bad remittances, and will 
aflbrd no inducements to our allies or others to afford us 
similar aids on future occasions. 

With great respect, I have the honour to be, 
Dear sir, 
Your most obedient and humble servant, 

John Jay. 



190 LIFE OF JOHN JAY, 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON, PARIS. 

New-York, 27th Oct., 1786. 
Dear Sir, 

The inefficacy of our government becomes daily more 
and more apparent. Our treasury and our credit are in a 
sad situation : and it is probable that either the wisdom or 
the passions of the people will produce changes. A spirit 
of licentiousness has infected Massachusetts, which appears 
more formidable than some at first apprehended. Whether 
similar symptoms will not soon mark a like disease in sev- 
eral other States is very problematical. 

The public papers herewith sent contain every thing 
generally known about these matters. A reluctance to 
taxes, an impatience of government, a rage for property 
and little regard to the means of acquiring it, together with 
a desire of equality in all things, seem to actuate the mass 
of those who are uneasy in their circumstances. To these 
may be added the influence of ambitious adventurers, and 
the speculations of the many characters who prefer private 
to public good, and of others who expect to gain more from 
wrecks made by tempests than from the produce of pa- 
tient and honest industry. As the knaves and fools of this 
world are for ever in alliance, it is easy to perceive how 
much vigour and wisdom a government, from its construc- 
tion and administration, should possess, in order to repress 
the evils which naturally flow from such copious sources of 
injustice and evil. 

Much, I think, is to be feared from the sentiments w r hich 
such a state of things is calculated to infuse into the minds 
of the rational and well-intentioned. In their eyes, the 
charms of liberty will daily fade ; and in seeking for peace 
and security, they will too naturally turn towards systems 
in direct opposition to those which oppress and disquiet 
them. 

If faction should long bear down law and government, 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENT E. 191 

tyranny may raise its head, or the more sober part of the 
people may even think of a king. 

In short, my dear sir, we are in a very unpleasant situa- 
tion. Changes are necessary; but what they ought to be, 
what they will be, and how and when to be produced, are 
arduous questions. I feel for the cause of liberty, and for 
the honour of my countrymen who have so nobly asserted 
it. and who, at present, so abuse its blessings. If it should 
not take root in this soil, little pains will be taken to cul- 
tivate it in any other. 

I have the honour to be, with great respect, 
Dear sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

John J a v. 



TO JOIIN ADAM?. 

Office for Foreign Affairs, > 
New-York, 1st November, 1 7Sfi. S 

Dear Sir, 

My report on the answer of the British minister to your 
memorial respecting our frontier posts, is under the consid- 
eration of Congress. Your ideas and mine on those sub- 
jects very nearly correspond, and I sincerely wish that you 
may be enabled to accommodate every difference between 
us and Britain, on the most liberal principles of justice and 
candour. The result of my inquiries into the conduct of 
the States relative to the treaty, is, that there has not been 
a single day since it took effect, on which it has not been 
violated in America, by one or other of the States ; and this 
observation is just, whether the treaty be supposed to have 
taken effect either at the date or exchange of the provisional 
articles, or on the day of the date of the definitive treaty, or 
of the ratifications of it. 

Our affairs are in a very unpleasant situation, and 
changes become necessary, and in some little degree prob- 
able. When government, either from defects in its con- 



192 LIFE OP JOHN JAY. 

struction or administration, ceases to assert its rights, or is 
too feeble to afford security, inspire confidence, and over- 
awe the ambitious and licentious, the best citizens naturally 
grow uneasy and look to other systems. 

How far the disorders of Massachusetts may extend, or 
how they will terminate, is problematical ; nor is it possible 
to decide whether the people of Rhode Island will remain 
much longer obedient to the very extraordinary and ex- 
ceptionable laws passed, for compelling them to embrace the 
doctrine of the political transubstantiation of paper into 
gold and silver. 

I suspect that our posterity will read the history of our 
last four years with much regret. 

I enclose for your information a pamphlet, containing the 
acts of the different States granting an impost to Congress. 

You will also find enclosed a copy of an act of Congress, 
of 20th and 21st ult., for raising an additional number of 
troops. This measure was doubtless necessary, although 
the difficulty of providing for the expense of it is a serious 
one. I flatter myself you will be able to obviate any im- 
proper suspicions which the minister may be led to enter- 
tain respecting the object of this force. I have pressed the 
policy of deciding on my report on the infractions of the 
treaty without delay, that you may thence be furnished 
with conclusive arguments against the insinuations of those 
who may wish to infuse and support opinions unfavourable 
to us on these points. 

The newspapers herewith sent will give you information 
in detail of Indian affairs, but they will not tell you what, 
however is the fact, that our people have committed several 
unprovoked acts of violence against them. These acts 
ouo-ht to have excited the notice of government, and been 
punished in an exemplary manner. 

With great and sincere esteem and regard, I have the 
honour to be, dear sir, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

John Jay. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 193 



TO JACOB REED. 

New- York, 12th Dec, 1786. 
Dear Sir, 
Your friendly letter has long remained unanswered ; but 
a variety of private, as well as public affairs, constrained 
me to postpone indulging myself in the pleasure I always 
derive from writing to my friends. The recess (if I may 
so call it) of Congress gives their officers too much leisure 
at present ; and there is reason to fear, that the members 
will be as long in convening this year as they were last. 
Business is at a stand for want of an adequate represent- 
ation. The languor of the States is to be lamented ; many 
inconveniences have already arisen from it, and if continued, 
serious evils will awaken our people. Our affairs, my dear 
sir, are in a delicate situation, and it is much to be wished, 
that the real patriots, throughout the States, would exert 
themselves to render it more sale and respectable. The 
feuds in Massachusetts are rather suspended than extin- 
guished. What events they may ultimately produce, is 
uncertain ; but I should not be surprised if much trouble 
was to result from them. The public creditors will soon 
become importunate, and Congress cannot create the means 
of satisfying them. It is true that order usually succeeds 
confusion ; but it is a high price to pay for order, espe- 
cially when a little virtue and good sense would procure 
it for us on very reasonable terms. If the best men would 
be prevailed upon to come forward, and take the lead in 
our legislatures as well as in Congress, and would unite 
their endeavours to rescue their country from its present 
condition, our affairs, both at home and abroad, would soon 
wear a more pleasing aspect. It is time for our people to 
distinguish more accurately than they seem to do, between 
liberty and licentiousness. The late revolution would lose 
much of its glory, as well as utility, if our conduct should

erning themselves."

New-York, 25th July, 1787. 
Dear Sir, 
Permit me to hint whether it would not be wise and sea- 
sonable to provide a strong check to the admission of 
foreigners into the administration of our national govern- 
ment ; and to declare expressly that the command in chief 
of the American army shall not be given to, nor devolve on 
any but a natural born citizen.

Mount Vernon, August 3d, 1788. 

Dear Sir, 

The letters which you did me the favour of writing to 
me on the 17th and 23d of last month from Poughkeepsie, 
came duly to hand, and claim my particular acknow- 
ledgments. 

With peculiar pleasure I now congratulate you on the 
success of your labours to obtain an unconditional ratifica- 
tion of the proposed constitution in the Convention of your 
State, the account of which was brought to us by the mail 
of yesterday. 

Although I could hardly conceive it possible, after ten 
States had adopted the constitution, that New- York, sepa- 
rated as it is from the remaining three, and so peculiarly 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 195 

divided in sentiments as it is, would withdraw herself from 
the union, yet considering the great majority which appeared 
to cling together in the < Convention, and the decided temper 
of the leaders in the opposition, I did not, I confess, see the 
means by which it was to be avoided. 

The exertion of those who were able to effect this great 
work, must have been equally arduous and meritorious. It 
is to be hoped that the State of North Carolina will not 
spend much time in deciding on this question, and as to 
Rhode Island, its conduct hitherto has so far baffled all 
calculation, that few are disposed to hazard a conjecture 
thereon. 

With sentiments of the sincerest esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and affectionate servant,

to george washington. 

New- York, 21st September, 1788. 
Dear Sir, 

I am not sure that the new government will be found to 
rest on principles sufficiently stable to produce a uniform 
adherence to what justice, dignity, and liberal policy may 
require ; for however proper such conduct may be, none 
but great minds will always deem it expedient. Men in 
general are guided more by conveniences than by princi- 
ples ; this idea accompanies all my reflections on the new 
constitution, and induced me to remark to our late Conven- 
tion at Poughkeepsie, that some of the most unpopular and 
strong parts of it appeared to me to be the most unex- 
ceptionable. Government without liberty is a curse ; but 
on the other hand, liberty without government is far from 
being a blessing. 

The opponents in this State to the constitution decrease 
and grow temperate. Many of them seem to look forward 



196 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

to another Convention, rather as a measure that will justify 
their opposition, than produce all the effects they pretended 
to expect from it. I wish that measure may be adopted 
with a good grace, and without delay or hesitation. So 
many good reasons can be assigned for postponing the 
session of such a Convention for three or four years, that I 
really believe the great majority of its advocates would be 
satisfied with that delay ; after which I think we should not 
have much danger to apprehend from it, especially if the 
new government should in the mean time recommend itself 
to the people by the wisdom of their proceedings, which I 
flatter myself will be the case. The division of the 
powers of government into three departments, is a great 
and valuable point gained, and will give the people the best 
opportunity of bringing the question whether they can 
govern themselves to a decision in their favour.

tured by what leading motives they will probably be influ-

shall not omit to apprize them of your services and charac- 
ter. This I take to be the precise extent of your request, 
and thus far my desire of serving vou may, I think, be 
gratified. You are aware, my dear sir, that my official 
station prescribes a degree of delicacy and reserve relative 
to other departments, which, though sometimes unpleasant, 
is always proper. It gives me pleasure to be persuaded, 
that on this head our sentiments correspond, and that you

from gouverneur morris. 

Paris, 1st July, 1789. 
My Dear Sir, 

I am too much occupied to find time for the use of a 
cipher, and in effect, the government here is so much occu- 
pied with their own affairs, that in transmitting to you a 
letter under an envelope, there is no risk. This, however, 
I am pretty certain will go safe. The States-general have 
now been a long time in session, and have done nothing 
lntherto. They have been engaged in a dispute, whether 
they shall form one body or three. The commons, who 
are represented by a number equal to both the others, and 
who besides have at least one-half the representatives of 
the clergy, insist on forming a single house. They have 
succeeded. But the nobles deeply feel their situation. The 
king, after siding with them, was frightened into an aban- 
donment of them. He acts now from terror only. The 
soldiery in this city, particularly the French guards, de- 
clare they will not act against the people. They are now 
treated by the mobility, and parade about the streets drunk, 
huzzaing for the Tiers. Some of them have, in consequence, 
been confined, not by the force, but by the adroitness of 
authority. Last night this circumstance became known, 
and immediately a mob repaired to the prison. The sol- 
diers on guard unfixed their bayonets, and joined the assail- 
ants. A party of dragoons, ordered on duty to disperse 
the riot, thought it better to drink with the rioters, and 
return back to their quarters. The soldiers, with others 
confined in the same prison, were then paraded in triumph 
to the Palais Royal, which is now the liberty pole of this 
city, and there they celebrated, as usual, their joy. Proba-

bly this evening some other prisons will be opened, for 
" Liberte" is now the general cry, and " autorite" is a name, 
not a real existence. 

The court are about to form a camp in the neighbour- 
hood of Paris, of 25,000 men, under the command of the 
Marechal de Broglio. I do not know him personally, 
therefore cannot judge what may be expected from his 
talents ; but all my information goes to the point, that 
he will never bring his army to act against the people. 
The Guard du Corps are as warm adherents (in general) to 
the Tiers as anybody else, strange as that may seem ; so 
that in effect the sword has slipped out of the monarch's 
hands, without his perceiving a tittle of the matter. All 
these things in a nation not yet fitted by education and 
habit for the enjoyment of freedom, gives one frequent sus- 
picions that they will indeed greatly overshoot their mark, 
if indeed they have not already done it. Already some 
people talk of limiting the king's negative upon the laws. 
And as they have hitherto felt severely the authority exer- 
cised in the name of their princes, every limitation of that 
authority seems to them desirable. Xever having felt the 
evils of too weak an executive, the disorders to be appre- 
hended from anarchy make, as yet. no impression. 

The provincial assemblies or administrations, in other 
words, the popular executive of the provinces, which Turgot 
had imagined as a means of moderating the regal legislative 
of the court, is now insisted on as a counter security against 
the monarch, when they shall have established a democrati- 
cal legislative, for you will observe that the noble and clerical 
orders are henceforth to be vox et preeterea nihil. The 
king is to be limited to the exact sum needful for his per- 
sonal expenses. The management of the public debt, and 
revenues to provide for it, will be taken entirely out of his 
hands, and the subsistence of the army is to depend on tem- 
porary grants. Hence it must follow, that his negative, in 
whatever form reserved, will be of little avail. These are 
the outlines of the proposed constitution, by which at the 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 199 

same time lettres de cachet are to be abrogated, and the 
liberty of the press established. 

My private opinion is, that the king, to get fairly out of the 
scrape in which he finds himself, would subscribe to any 
thing ; and truly from him little is to be expected in any way. 
The queen, hated, humbled, mortified, feels, and feigns, and 
intrigues to save some shattered remnants of the royal au- 
thority ; but to know that she favours a measure is the certain 
means to frustrate its success. The Count D'Artois, alike 
hated, is equally busy, but has neither sense to counsel him- 
self, nor choose counsellors for himself, much less to counsel 
others. The nobles look up to him for support, and lean on 
what they know to be a broken reed, for want of some more 
solid dependence. In their anguish, they curse Neckar, 
who is, in fact, less the cause than the instrument of their suf- 
ferings. His popularity depends now more on the opposition 
he meets with from one party, than any serious regard of 
the other. It is the attempt to throw him down which saves 
him from falling. He has no longer the preponderating 
weight in council, which a fortnight ago decided every 
thing. If they were not afraid of consequences, he would 
be dismissed ; and, on the same principle, the king has re- 
fused to accept his resignation. If his abilities were equal 
to his genius, and he were as much supported by firmness 
as he is swayed by ambition, he would have had the exalted 
honour of giving a free constitution to above twenty mil- 
lions of his fellow-creatures, and would have reigned long 
in their hearts, and received the unanimous applause of 
posterity. But as it is, he must soon fall. Whether his 
exit will be physical or moral, must depend on events 
which I cannot foresee. The best chance that royalty has 
is, that popular excesses may alarm. At the rate in which 
things are now going, the king of France must soon be one 
of the most limited monarchs in Europe. Adieu. 

I am yours, 

GoUVERNEUR MoRRIS.

TO CHARLES PETTIT. 

New-York, 14th July, 1789. 
Dear Sir, 

Your obliging letter of the 5th instant was delivered to 
me last week. 

You know it is important that confidence and cordiality 
subsist between the heads of the departments, that they 
may, when necessary, unite their efforts to promote their 
respective operations for the public good. To this end 
much delicacy and candour should be observed towards 
each other, and all unnecessary interference avoided. It 
is likewise important that harmony and confidence subsist 
between the principal and other officers of each depart- 
ment, that no personal jealousies or discontents may em- 
barrass the business of it. These and all other prudential 
considerations will doubtless have their due degree of 
weight with the president, in all his nominations ; and I 
mention them, merely because they lead me to think it 
would be improper for me to recommend to the president 
any person for a place in any other department than the 
one in which I may hold the first. All that I could do, 
therefore, in the present case was, to inform the president 
that it would give you pleasure to serve the public in the 
place you mention. This I have done, nor could details 
be necessary. You are far from being a stranger to the 
public ; you have enjoyed strong marks of their confi- 
dence, and have long been personally known to the 
president. 

I have the honour to be, dear sir, 

Your most obedient and humble servant, 

John Jay.

New- York, 27th November, 1789, 
Dear Sir. 
I have this moment been favoured with your letter of the 
10th of this month. Mr. Sedgwick has given me the same 
character of Mr. Tucker that you do. There are at pres- 
ent several candidates for the place in question,* and prob- 
ably the number will be increased before the appointment 
takes place. As it should be the result of mutual informa- 
tion and joint consultation between the judges, it appears to 
me proper that I should in the mean time remain free from 
engagements, express or implied, to or for any gentleman, 
however well recommended. The reserve which this con- 
sideration imposes will not permit me to enlarge upon this 
subject ; but I know of no consideration which should restrain 
me from assuring you very explicitly of the esteem with 
which I am, dear sir, 

Your most obedient and humble servant,

Dear Sir, 
I was favoured with yours of the 28th ultimo as I was 
preparing to go out of town. It was not until last evening 
that I returned, or I should have taken an earlier opportu- 
nity of answering your letter. 

Accept my thanks tor your friendly congratulations. I 
believe them sincere, and value them accordingly. It would 
give me great pleasure to see your situation more comfort- 
able. On these occasions it is best to be very explicit ; it 
would neither be friendly nor candid to excite delusory

expectations, or to make promises without a good prospect 
of performing them. There is not a single office in my 
gift ; nor do I recollect that there is more than one in the 
appointment of the court, I mean their clerk. As to offices 
in the gift of other departments, I think it my duty not to 
interfere, nor to ask favours, it being improper for a judge 
to put himself under such obligations. 

I am sincerely disposed to serve my friends, and you 
among others ; but it can only be in a way perfectly con- 
sistent with the duties and proprieties of my public station. 
These considerations will, I am persuaded, have their due 
weight with you, and rather increase than diminish the 
esteem and attachment you have always expressed and 
manifested for me. I regret that on this occasion I can- 
not say things more consonant with your wishes ; but 
sincerity, though not always pleasing, is preferable to mere 
civility. 

Be assured of my constant regard, and that I remain 

Your friend,

Secretary of the Treasury. 

Philadelphia, 13th Nov., 1790. 

My Dear Sir, 

I enclose you copies of two resolutions which have passed 
the House of Representatives of Virginia. Others had 
been proposed and disagreed to. But the war was still 
going on. A spirited remonstrance to Congress is talked of. 

This is the first symptom of a spirit which must either 
be killed, or will kill the constitution of the United States. 
I send the resolutions to you, that it may be considered 
what ought to be done. 

Ought not the collective weight of the different parts of 
the government to be employed in exploding the principles 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 202 

they contain ? This question arises out of sudden and un- 
digested thought. 

I remain, dear sir, 
Your affectionate and obedient humble servant, 

Alexander Hamilton. 

" Resolved, That it is the opinion of this committee, that 
so much of the act of Congress entitled 'An act making 
provision for the debt of the United States' as assumes the 
payment of the State debts, is repugnant to the constitu- 
tion of the United States, as it goes to the exercise of a 
power not expressly granted to the general government. 

"Resolved, That so much of the act entitled 'An act 
making provision for the debt of the United States' as hinits 
the right of the United States in their redemption of the 
public debt is dangerous to the rights and subversive of the 
interests of the people, and demands the marked disappro- 
bation of the General Assembly." 

TO ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

Boston, 28th Nov., 1790. 

Dear Sir, 

On returning from Exeter the evening before the last, I 
had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 13th inst. 
with the two copies mentioned in it. Having no appre- 
hension of such measures, what was to be done appeared 
to me a question of some difficulty as well as importance. 
To treat them as very important might render them more 
so than I think they are. The author of McFingal could 
do justice to the subject. The assumption will do its own 
work. It will justify itself, and not want advocates. Every 
indecent interference of State assemblies will diminish 
their influence. The national government has only to do 
what is right, and if possible, be silent. If compelled to 
speak, it should be in few words, strongly evincive of tern- 



204 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

per, dignity, and self-respect. Conversation and desultory 
paragraphs will do the rest. 

The national government gains ground in these countries, 
and I hope care will be taken to cherish the national spirit 
which is prevailing in them. The deviation from contract 
touching interest does not please very universally. An 
individual remarked, that while Congress thought them- 
selves authorized to take such liberties, private property 
could not be secure in a national bank. 

Yours affectionately, 

John J a v. 

FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Philadelphia, Sept. 4th, 1791. 

My hear Sir, 

The indisposition, and consequent absence from Mount 
Vernon, of my nephew, Major Washington, to whom the 
care of my private business is intrusted, makes it indis- 
pensably necessary for me to go home before the meeting 
of Congress. 

My stay there will be longer or shorter, according to cir- 
cumstances ; but it cannot exceed the middle of October, as 
I must be back before the meeting of that body. 

Will you permit me, my dear sir, to make a similar 
request to the one I did last year, and to pray that your 
ideas may not be confined to matters merely judicial, but 
extended to all other topics which have, or may occur to 
you, as fit subjects for general or private communications. 
With sincere esteem and affectionate regard, 
I am, my dear sir, 
Your obedient and very humble servant, 

George Washington. 



MISCELLANEOtS CORRESPONDENCE. 205 

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

New-York, 23d Sept., 1791. 
Dear .Sir. 
My firsl idea was to have made a sketch of what, in my 
opinion, would be proper on the occasion ; but finding in the 
progress of it that my information relative to the actual 
state of affairs was not sufficiently particular, and in 
several respects defective, it became necessary to confine 
mys< eral remarks. 

How far the present fiscal arrangements require amend- 
ments or additions, can best be ascertained of the secre- 
tary. I recollect one case which should be provided for, 
viz. where bribes are offered to revenue officers. It will 
rarely happen that the offer of a bribe can be proved, ex- 
cept by the man to whom it is offered, and if he be dis- 
qualified (by being interested in the penalty) from giving 
testimony, the offender must be acquitted. Auxiliary pro- 
visions may, in the execution of other parts of these 
statutes, have been found wanting ; this merits inquiry. If 
amendments are contemplated, it may be proper to ob- 
serve, that as all new T institutions are liable to defects which 
experience only can discover, it may be useful to consider 
whether the revenue laws require any amendments to ren- 
der them more competent to their objects. 

Whether it is intended to bring forward any and what 
plans for additional supplies, I know not; if it is, some gen- 
eral ideas leading the attention that w r ay might be expe- 
dient. If not, perhaps it would be well to observe, that the 
existing revenues being equal to the ordinary exigences of 
the nation, it will not be necessary to increase them for 
any other purpose than that of reducing the public debt. 
This idea, I think, should be constantly held up. 

If there should this year be a surplus of revenue, the 
whole or part of which could be spared for domestic ob- 
jects, might it not be best to apply it towards discharging 



206 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

the French debt, and to introduce the recommendation by 
some observations like these, viz. that the friendly disposi- 
tion and aids of the king and people of France had been 
highly conducive to the establishment of our liberty and 
independence : and therefore that they might, with great 
propriety, expect from the United States every mark of 
attention which their and our circumstances might render 
eligible. That the cause of liberty and good government 
was the cause of all mankind ; and that the exertions of the 
citizens of France to introduce and establish those blessings, 
not only merited general approbation, but were particularly 
entitled to our best wishes for their success. That the 
United States could not better evince this friendly disposi- 
tion than by applying part of their revenues towards pay- 
ing the debt due to France, at a season when, from the 
derangements incident to revolutions, it could not fail of 
being both acceptable and useful. 

Indian affairs afford another topic, but on this subject my 
information is too limited to enable me to see things as 
they probably are. But be they as they may, it might 
answer a good purpose occasionally to hint at the justice 
and policy of treating those nations with benevolence, and 
with constant regard to good faith. 

If circumstances of importance should make it proper to 
say any thing of the territories, and the immediate govern- 
ment of the United States, it would afford an opportunity 
of recommending the encouragement of schools, and the 
policy of assisting the settlers in making such highways as 
might open and facilitate communications with the adjacent 
States. 

As to foreign affairs, I am inclined to think that at present 
little, if any thing, should be said about them; unless some 
matters very interesting to the United States should have 
occurred. It is said, that a minister from England may 
soon be expected. He may, or he may not come. The 
disposition of that court towards us cannot yet, I believe, 



MISCELLANEOl S CORRESPONDED E. 207 

be unequivocally ascertained. To be silent, and thereby 
to avoid either courting or irritating them, appears to me 
advisable in the present moment 

The judicial system undoubtedly calls for revision; but 
I rather think it will be better to include it generally among 
those other subjects heretofore recommended, which it may 
be necessary again to mention, than to make any pointed 
remarks respecting it. 

To convey necessary information, and to suggest useful 
hints on the one hand, and on the other so to do both as to 
cause as few questions or divisions as possible in framing 
the addresses in answer, seems to be all that can be re- 
quisite. 

All things have their order. All that ought to be done, 
cannot be done at once. Those, therefore, of the greatest 
present importance should take the lead, and the rest be 
reserved for future sessions. 

As to public and private communications, it strikes me 
that the former should contain only important and public 
information, and in generals ; and that details, as well as 
intelligence of a more secret nature, or of lesser import- 
ance, should be conveyed by message. 

The census is a subject about which much might, but 
little need be said, the observations pertinent to it being ob- 
vious. I think that something should be said, generally 
and cautiously (by way of information), of the proceedings 
in the business of the federal district ; and if necessary, 
the details mav be communicated by message. Of the 
bank, I doubt the expediency of saying any tiling ; espe- 
cially as its affairs are under the management of its 
directors. 

Thus, my dear sir, I have committed to paper what 
passed in my mind relative to these subjects with that free- 
dom which your friendship invites, and without that caution 
and reserve which a sense of your judgment, experience, 
and discretion tends naturally to create. 



208 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

I regret the circumstance which called you to Mount 
Vernon, and hope the recovery of your nephew has re- 
lieved you from all anxieties on that account. I can per- 
ceive no reasons which ought to restrain you from frequent 
visits to it during the recess of Congress. It would con- 
duce to your health, and so far to the public good. Be- 
sides, the distance is not so great, but that in the ordinary 
course of things, your presence at Philadelphia might, at 
convenient intervals, be spared ; for should any thing ex- 
traordinary occur, you might very soon be advised of it, 
and if necessary, return. Be pleased to present my respect- 
ful compliments to your lady ; and believe me to be, with 
perfect respect, esteem, and attachment, 

Dear sir,

John Jay.

Hartford, 2d November, 1791. 
My dear Brother, 

A person who says he left New- York last Friday, reports 
that a putrid disorder prevailed there, and that among many 
others, it had rendered your house a house of mourning. 
This unexpected event affects me greatly. I can easily 
conceive what your feelings on the occasion must be, and 
sympathize with you very sincerely. I much regret my 
absence from you, for although friendly attentions cannot 
heal the wounds of affliction, they in some degree assuage 
their anguish. I know, and that by experience, that more 
consolation is to be derived from a firm confidence in the 
wisdom of Him who governs the world, and from resigna- 
tion to His will who never errs, than from all other circum- 
stances and considerations united. Our departed friends 
are but gone home before us. We must all follow, and, if 
prepared to follow, shall after a little while rejoin them, 
where death or pain can never intrude. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 209 

It is true, that in the mean time we neither can nor ought 
to obliterate the impressions which such events naturally 
make on the human heart and mind. But there certainly 
is a difference between sustaining the burden of affliction 
as Christians, and sinking under it as men without fortitude 
or hope. 

May God grant you those consolations which the world 
cannot give nor take away. 

Believe me to be, 

Your very affectionate brother, 

John Jay.

New-York, 31st M in h, 1793. 
My good Friend, 

I have had the pleasure of seeing Senor Ceracchi, and 
his model of a monument in honour of the revolution. The 
design appears to me to be a noble one, worthy the attention 
of the United States, and honourable to the taste and 
talents of the artist. It cannot fail of being interesting to 
all who contributed to the revolution, and to that glorious 
triumph of liberty which it exhibited, and which well de- 
serves a magnificent monument. The ancient republics, 
to whose very imperfections we are sometimes partial, 
afford precedents. Why should not the Congress adopt 
and carry this design into execution ? The expense ? for 
my part I think the expense proper, and therefore confide 
in the sense and sentiment of the public. If the money 
was now to be provided, the measure would be iinseason- 
able, on account of the Indian war. That obstacle will be 
of short duration. We need not begin the monument this 
year. To adopt the plan will cost nothing. The work 
must necessarily be long on hand, and as the expense will 
be gradually incurred, so also it will be gradually defrayed. 
The sum annually requisite can be but small compared 

VOL. II. D P 



210 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

with the object, and with our resQurces. Although it would 
better become the nation, than individuals, to undertake it, 
yet provided the nation assume the task, the aid of subscrip- 
tions, and even State donations, might, if necessary, be 
recurred to. If you would say, it shall be begun as soon 
as a certain sum is subscribed, there is reason to believe it 
would be subscribed. If the ways and means be referred 
to Colonel Hamilton, he will indicate the most eligible. 
His official station, information, and talents, would render it 
proper. 

The gentleman who formed the design, will be the most 
proper person to execute it. Another artist would not feel 
the same degree of interest in it, nor is it certain that 
another of equal talents could easily be had. 

As to his reward, — it is a matter which I think should 
not (// present be contemplated. Let the work be finished, 
and then make him such an acknowledgment as would 
become the nation on the one hand, and him on the other. 
I can conceive of no other rule on such occasions, and in 
relation to such objects. 

I confess to you that the effect which this measure would 
naturally have on the president's feelings, is with me an 
additional inducement. We shall not be reproached for 
letting him die by an executioner, or in chains, or in exile, 
or in neglect and disgrace, as many Greek and Roman 
patriots died. On the contrary, we shall be commended 
throughout all generations for the part we have hitherto 
acted respecting him. It is only while he lives that we can 
have the satisfaction of offering the fruits of gratitude and 
affection to his enjoyment. Posterity can have only the 
pensive pleasure of strewing flowers on his grave. 

Yours affectionately, 

John Jay.

FROM ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

[Private.] 

Philadelphia, Sept. 3d, 1792. 

My Dear Sik, 
The proceedings at Pittsburgh, which you will find stated 
in the enclosed paper, and other incidents in the western 

parts of this State, announce so determined and persevering 
a spirit of opposition to the laws, as, in my opinion, to 
render a vigorous exertion of the powers of government 
indispensable. I have communicated this opinion to the 
president, and I doubt not his impressions will accord with 
it. In this case, one point for consideration will be the 
expediency of the next circuit court's noticing the state of 
things in that quarter, particularly the meeting at Pittsburgh, 
and its proceedings. You will observe an avowed object 
is to " obstruct Reoperation of the law.*' This is attempted 
to be qualified by a pretence of doing it by "every legal 
measure." But "legal measures" " to obstruct the opera- 
tion of a law," is a contradiction in terms. I therefore 
entertain no doubt, that a high misdemeanor has been com- 
mitted. The point, however, is under submission to the 
attorney-general for his opinion. 

There is really, my dear sir, a crisis in the affairs of the 
country, which demands the most mature consideration of 
its best and wisest friends. 

I beg you to apply your most serious thoughts to it, and 
favour me, as soon as possible, with the result of your 
reflections. Perhaps it will not be amiss for you to con- 
verse with Mr. King. His judgment is sound. He has 
caution and energy. 

Would a proclamation from the president be advisable, 
stating the criminality of such proceedings, and warning all 
persons to abstain from them, as the laws will be strictly 
enforced against all offenders '. 

If the plot should thicken, and the application of force 



212 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

should appear to be unavoidable, will it be expedient for the 
president to repair in person to the scene of commotion ? 

These are some of the questions which present them- 
selves. The subject will doubtless open itself in all its 
aspects to you. With real respect, and affectionate attach- 
ment, I remain, dear sir, 

Your obedient servant, 

Alexander Hamilton. 

to alexander hamilton. 

New-York, Sth Sept., 1792. 

Dear Sir, 

I have conferred with Mr. King on the subject of your 
letter of the 3d inst. We concur in opinion that neither a 
proclamation, nor a particular charge by the court to the 
grand jury would be advisable at present. To us it ap- 
pears more prudent, that this business be opened by the 
president's speech, at the ensuing session of Congress. 
Their address will manifest the sense of the House, and both 
together operate more effectually than a proclamation. 

No strong declarations should be made, unless there be 
ability and disposition to follow them with strong measures. 
Admitting both these requisites, it is questionable whether 
such operations at this moment would not furnish the Anties 
with materials for deceiving the uninformed part of the 
community, and in some measure render the operations of 
government odious. Let all the branches of government 
move together, and let the chiefs be committed publicly on 
one or the other side of the question. I perceive symptoms 
of the crisis you mention ; if managed with discretion and 
firmness, it will weaken its authors. If matters can pass 
on, sub silentio, until the meeting of Congress, I think all 
will be well. The public will become informed, and the 
sense of the nation become manifest. Opposition to that 
sense will be clogged with apprehensions, and strong meas- 
ures, if necessary, will be approved, and be supported. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 213 

if, in the mean time, such outrages should be committed 
as to force the attention of government to its dignity, 
nothing will remain but to obey that necessity in a way that 
will leave nothing to hazard. Success, on such occasions, 
should be certain. Whether this should be done under the 
president's personal direction, must, I think, depend on 
circumstances at the time; or in other words, on the de- 
gree of importance which those circumstances combined 
may evince. 

Yours affectionately, 

John Jay. 

from alexander hamilton. 

Philadelphia, December ISth, 1792. 
My dear Sir, 

Your favours of the 26th November and 10th inst. have 
duly come to hand. I am ashamed that the former has 
remained so long unacknowledged; though I am persuaded 
my friends would readily excuse my delinquencies, could 
they appreciate my situation. 'Tis not the load of proper 
official business that alone engrosses me, though this would 
be enough to occupy any man. 'Tis not the extra atten- 
tions I am obliged to pay to the course of legislative ma- 
noeuvres, that alone adds to my burthen and perplexity. 
'Tis the malicious intrigues to stab me in the dark, against 
which 1 am too often obliged to guard myself, that distract 
and harass me to a point, which, rendering my situation 
scarcely tolerable, interferes with objects to which friend- 
ship and inclination would prompt me. 

I have not, however, been unmindful of the subject of 
your letters. Mr. Kino- will tell you the state the business 
was in. Nothing material has happened since. The rep- 
resentation will probably produce some effect, though not 
as great as ought to be expected. Some changes for the 
better, I trust, will take place. 

The success of the vice-president is as great a source of 



214 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

satisfaction, as that of Mr. Clinton would have been of mor- 
tification and pain to me. Willingly, however, would I 
relinquish my share of the command to the anti-federalists, 
if I thought they were to be trusted. But I have so many 
proofs of the contrary, as to make me dread the experiment 
of their preponderance. 

Very respectfully and affectionately, dear sir, 

Your obedient servant, 

A. Hamilton.

New- York, 19th December, 1792. 
Dear Sir, 

On my return this evening from Rye, I found your letter 
of the 18th instant at my house. It is not difficult to per- 
ceive that your situation is unpleasant, and it is easy to 
predict that your enemies will endeavour to render it still 
more so. The thorns they strew in your way will (if you 
please) hereafter blossom, and furnish garlands to decorate 
your administration. Resolve nol to be driven from your 
station, and as your situation must, it seems, be militant, act 
accordingly. Envy will tell posterity that your difficulties, 
from the state of things, wore inconsiderable, compared 
with the great, growing, and untouched resources of the 
nation. Your difficulties from persons and party will, by 
time, be carried out of sight, unless you prevent it. ?Co 
other person will possess sufficient facts and details to do 
full justice to the subject, and I think your reputation points 
to the expediency of memoirs. You want time, it is true, 
but few of us know how much time we can find when we 
set about it. 

Had not your letter come from the post-office, I should 
suspect it had been opened. The wafer looked very much 
like it. Such letters should be sealed with wax, impressed 
with your seal. 

I rejoice with you in the re-election of Mr. Adams. It

has relieved my mind from much inquietude. It is a great 
point gained ; but the unceasing industry and arts of the 
Anties render perseverance, union, and constant efforts 
necessary. 

Adieu, my dear sir. 

Yours, sincerely,

Silt. 

Accept my thanks for the ingenious work which you was 
so obliging as to send me by Mr. Childs. I have read it 
with pleasure and improvement: it casts new light on 
several interesting questions, and I observe in it a degree 
of perspicuity not always to be found in dissertations on 
such subjects. 

The connexion between mind and body, and the opera- 
tions of the former on and through the latter, continue 
involved in great obscurity. Persevering attention and 
inquiry will, probably, produce further information. The 
spiritual and material worlds, if I may use the expression, 
appear to me to be so widely different and opposite, that I 
am often inclined to suspect the existence of others, inter- 
mediate, but of a nature distinct from cither. 

It is much to be wished that nothing may occur to pre- 
vent your finishing the analysis of the intellectual powers, 
and extending your speculations to man considered as an 
active and moral being, and as he m mber of a political 
society. There is reason to doubt whether this field of 
science has, as yet, received the highest cultivation of which 
it is capable. The republic of letters is under many 
obligations to your country. May those obligations be 
increased.

New-York, 30th April, 1794. 
Dear Sir, 
I was this day honoured with your letter of yesterday. 
I expect to sail in the course of a fortnight, and, if my 
prayers and endeavours avail, my absence will not be of 
long duration. 

From the confidence you repose in me, I derive the most 
pleasing emotions, and I thank you for them. Life is uncer- 
tain — whether I take your letter with me, or leave it here, 
it would, in case of my death, be inspected by others, who, 
however virtuous, might be indiscreet. After much reflec- 
tion, I conclude it will be most prudent to commit it to you, 
without retaining any copy or memorandum, except in my 
memory, where the numerous proofs of your kind attention 
to me are carefully preserved. 

With perfect respect, esteem, and attachment, 
I am, dear sir, 
Your obliged and affectionate servant, 

John Jay. 

to george washington. 

London, 23d June, 1794. 

Dear Sir, 
My letter of this date to Mr. Randolph contains an exact 
account of the present state of the affairs of my mission 
here. I shall be disappointed if no good should result. 
As yet, the minister stands entirely uncommitted. From 
some light circumstances, I incline to believe that our mer- 
cantile injuries will be redressed ; but how or how far, I 
cannot conjecture. My next conference will doubtless 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 217 

place things in more particular and in clearer points of 
view. 

Dr. Gordon has information, winch he relies upon, that 
the posts will not be surrendered, and he authorizes me to 
tell you so in confidence. His information dors not make so 
strong an impression upon my mind as it docs on his; it 
merits attention, but, in my opinion, is not conclusive. 

The observations I have hitherto made induce me to be- 
lieve that the war with France is popular, and that a war 
with us would be unpopular. The word Jacobin is here a 
term of reproach, and used as such among the common 
people. They who wish the reform of this government, 
do, I apprehend, wish a certain degree of success to the 
present French cause, not because they like it, but because 
they think such success would promote their favourite ob- 
jects. I often hear gentlemen converse on these subjects, 
but I think it prudent to be reserved ; as to their internal 
parties and divisions, I make it a rule to remain silent. 

Your administration is greatly commended. The idea 
entertained by some, of applying private debts to compen- 
sate public injuries, alarms and disgusts, and impairs credit. 
I am anxious to have it in my power to communicate some- 
thing decisive. As yet, I am entirely satisfied with the 
minister. 

I ought to add, that Mr. Pinckney's conduct relative to 
me corresponds with my ideas of delicacy and propriety. 

With perfect respect, esteem, and attachment, 

I am, dear sir, 
Your obliged and obedient servant, 

John J a v. 

P. S. The enclosed copies of a note of the l!>th inst.

his present temper, that will not escape you. It is always 
useful to communicate such papers, but seldom useful to 
publish them. Publications, unnecessarily and frequently

made, must naturally increase reserve and circumspection 
to such a degree as, in a great measure, to exclude the ad- 
vantages of confidence and conversation, and to confine 
negotiation to the slow and, wary mode of written commu- 
nications, written too under the impression and expectation 
of publication, 

Your affectionate servant,

to george washington. 

London, 21st July, 1794. 

Dear Sir, 

Among my letters to Mr. Randolph, is one stating an 
agreement between Lord Grenville and myself for preserv- 
ing things in a pacific and unaltered state, between us and 
the British on the side of Canada and the frontiers ; and 
Mr. Simcoe will soon receive orders to retire from Miami 
to his former positions. 

Some cabinet councils have lately been held, and it is 
probable the manner of settling their differences with us 
has been among the subjects of their deliberations. From 
the silence and circumspection of Lord Grenville, I appre- 
hend that the cabinet has not as yet ultimately concluded 
on their plan. This delay is unpleasant, but I do not think 
it unnatural. The opposition members lately come in have 
so often held a language friendly to America, that it is prob- 
able they will find it necessary, in order to be consistent, to 
adhere to sentiments not agreeable to some of the others. 

I am led by several little circumstances, not easily de- 
tailed or explained, to believe that the late administration 
looked upon a war with us as inevitable ; and I am of opin- 
ion that the instructions of the 6th November were influ- 
enced by that idea. I do also believe that Lord Dorchester 
was instructed to act conformably to that idea, and that 
Simcoe was governed by it. 

I am certain that intelligence (which made some impres- 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 219 

sion) was conveyed to the ministry, that our army, if suc- 
cessful against the Indians, had orders to attack and take 
the posts. There is also room to believe, that the indiscreet 
reception given to the late French minister — the unneces- 
sary rejoicings about French successes, and a variety of 
similar circumstances, did impress the government with 
strong apprehensions of an unavoidable war with us, and 
did induce them to entertain a disposition hostile to us. 

1 have given Lord Grenville positive assurances, that no 
attack [tending the negotiations will be made on the posts 
held by them at the conclusion of the war ; but I also told 
him that I thought it highly probable that every new ad- 
vanced post, and particularly the one said to be taken by 
Mr. Simcoc on the Miami, would be attacked. I must do 
him the justice to say, that hitherto I have found him fair 
and candid, and apparently free from asperity or irritation. 

So far as personal attentions to the envoy may be re- 
garded as symptoms of good-will to his country, my pros- 
pect is favourable. These symptoms, however, are never 
decisive : they justify expectation, but not reliance. 

I most heartily wish the business over, and myself at 
home again. But it would not be prudent to urge and 
press unceasingly, lest ill-humour should result, and ill- 
humour will mar any negotiation ; on the other hand, much 
forbearance and seeming inactivity invite procrastination 
and neglect. The line between these extremes is delicate : 
I will endeavour to find and observe it. 

I am, dear sir, 
Your obliged and affectionate servant, 

JonN Jay.

Sir, 
Accept my thanks for the friendly congratulations and 
sentiments expressed in your letter of the 14th of this 
month. 



220 life OF J° HN ja y. 

I regret my not knowing that you resided at Bath. We 
passed from Falmouth through that city in our way to this. 
It would have given me pleasure to have called upon you, 
and (to use an Indian expression) have brightened the chain. 

Many great and unexpected events have taken place 
since we parted. We live in times that teem with them. 
A great and wonderful drama is exhibiting on the stage of 
Europe, perhaps of the world. We are spectators of the 
first act. What may succeed, or what the catastrophe will 
be, human prevision cannot discern. 

Peace and domestic comforts rise in value as they be- 
come precarious; and individual misery, by abounding, 
produces national distress ; and yet, even in this age of 
reason and philosophy, the passions do not cease to fan the 
flames of war, and cause them to rage, to spread, and to 
desolate. 

If, during my stay here, you should visit London, I shall 
be happy to see you, and to assure you of the esteem and 
regard with which I am 

Your obedient and very humble servant, 

John Jay. 

to george washington. 

London, 5th Aug., 1794. 
Dear Sir, 
I am this moment returned from a long conference with 
Lord Grenville. Our prospects become more and more 
promising as we advance in the business. The compensa- 
tion cases are described in the answer, and the amount of 
damages will, I have reason to hope, be referred to the de- 
cision of commissioners mutually to be appointed by the two 
governments, and the money paid without delay on their 
certificates, and the business finished as speedily as may be 
possible. The question of admitting our vessels into the 
islands, under certain limitations, is under consideration, and 
will soon be decided. A treaty of commerce is on the 
carpet. All other things being agreed, the posts will be

included. They contend that the article about the negroes 
does not extend to those who came in on their proclama- 
tion, to whom (being vested with the property in them by 
the rights of war) they gave freedom ; but only to those who 
were, bona fide, the property of Americans when the war 
ceased. They will, I think, insist that British debts, so far 
as injured by lawful impediments, should be repaired by 
the United States, by decision of mutual commissioners. 
These things have passed in conversation, but no commit- 
ments on either side — and not to be of any official weight 
or use whatever. 

The king observed to me the other day, " Well, sir, I 
imagine you begin to see that your mission will proba- 
bly be successful." — " I am happy, may it please your ma- 
jesty, to find that you entertain that idea." — " Well, but 
don't you perceive that it is like to be so ?" — " There are 
some recent circumstances (the answer to my representa- 
tion, &c.) which induce me to flatter myself that it will be 
so." He nodded with a smile, signifying that it was to 
those circumstances that he alluded. The conversation 
then turned to indifferent topics : this was at the drawing- 
room. 

I have never been more unceasingly employed than I 
have been for some time past, and still am. I hope for good, 
but God only knows. The Wm. Penn sails in the morning. 
I write these few lines in haste, to let you see that the busi- 
ness is going on as fast as can reasonably be expected ; and 
that it is very important that peace and quiet should be 
preserved for the present. On hearing, last night, that one 
of our Indiamen had been carried into Halifax, I mentioned 
it to Lord Grenville. He will write immediately by the 
packet on the subject. Indeed, I believe that they are en- 
deavouring to restore a proper conduct towards us every- 
v/irre, but it will take some time before the effect can be 
visible. I write all this to you in confidence, and for your 
private satisfaction. I have not time to explain my reasons,

but they are cogent. "I could fill some sheets with inter- 
esting communications, if I had leisure ; but other matters 
press, and must not be postponed, for " there is a tide in 
human affairs," of which every moment is precious. What- 
ever may be the issue, nothing in my power to ensure suc- 
cess shall be neglected or delayed.

to judge hobart. 

London, 12th Aug., 1794. 
My good Friend, 

I passed this morning in a visit to Sir John Sinclair, 
President of the Board of Agriculture, and to Col. Bentham, 
who is preparing for the establishment of a panopticon, 
agreeable to the plan delineated in a publication winch I 
once communicated to you. 

The Agricultural Society is incorporated, with a yearly 
allowance, by government, of three thousand pounds. Their 
plans are extensive ; they have been singularly indus- 
trious, and much has been done. I enclose you the pro- 
posed plan of their general report ; if executed in the extent 
and in the manner intended, it will be the most interesting 
work of the kind, respecting husbandry, which has appeared 
in any country. 

Sir John showed us sheep of different breeds, stuffed and 
prepared in the highest degree of perfection. Of these, 
drawings are making ; models are collecting of the most 
useful machines, among them is one for cleaning grain from 
the straw, which, by the help of two horses and a man and 
a boy, will do 70 or 80 bushels per day. They begin to be 
in use among the farmers, which I consider as a proof of 
their answering the purpose. 

Among the sheep, the Teesewater is the largest. Sir 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 223 

John showed me a fleece presented to the Board, which 
weighed twenty odd pounds. He tells me they frequently 
weigh sixty pounds a quarter. 

From Saxony, he is informed that the Spanish breed had 
been imported there : that they succeeded well, and did not 
merate. They sent him a sample of the wool. I en- 
close a lock of it. This fact shows that the fineness of wool 
depends not less on breed than on management. 

Sir John has a farm in Scotland which rented for £300 
a-year. It was employed in raising store-cattle, which 
wore usually sold into England, and fattened for the Lon- 
don market. He dismissed the cattle, and introduced 
sheep; it proved profitable, and he is now offered £1200 
a-year for it : his flock is 3000. 

The progress of husbandry in this country is astonishing; 
the king patronizes it, and is himself a great farmer. He 
has been doing much in that way at Windsor. 

Colonel Bentham has invented a number of curious and 
very useful machines, intended to be introduced into the 
panopticon. He showed us a model of the building ; it 
seems admirably calculated for its purposes. 

He has a machine for sawing at once from a plank the 
felloe of a wheel to its form — another contrivance for cutting 
it to its proper length and angle — another for finishing the 
spoke — another for boring and morticing the hub — another 
for driving the spokes. He has one for turning a circular 
saw for small work — another for making the mouldings, if 
they may be so called, on the pieces which form sashes — 
one for sawing stone — others for working different kinds of 
saws into many slabs at once — another for polishing them 
— another for planing boards, and taking a shaving of its 
full width from one end to the other, &c. &c. &c. He has 
patents for these machines, but as yet they cannot be pur- 
chased : he has one for cutting corks with incredible ex- 
pedition. 
. Governor Hunter, from Norfolk Island, with whom I 



224 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

was last week in company, speaking of its productions, 
mentioned that among the birds there were swans that 
were black, having only a few white feathers in the wings. 
They are plenty. One stuffed and well preserved, I am 
told, is here : as yet I have not seen it. He also mentioned 
a wild flax growing on upland to about three feet high, 
and good. I do not yet learn that any of the seed of it is 
here. 

They who have leisure and a turn for these things might 
here acquire much entertaining and some useful informa- 
tion. Want of time represses my curiosity, and will not 
allow me to pay much attention to objects unconnected with 
those of my mission.

to colonel read, charleston. 

London, 14th August, 1794. 
Dear Sir, 

We have both heard it asserted that a man's character 
may be discerned from his handwriting ; if that be true, 
you and our friend, Edward Rutledge, must be as enig- 
matical and unintelligible as Oliver Cromwell, and yet 
neither of you resemble him more than he did an honest man. 

The kindness diffused through your letter of the 19th of 
June paid me for the trouble of deciphering it. Two or 
three words, however, proved too hard for me. To judge 
from the context, I presume they mean something good 
and friendly, and therefore that I have reason to be pleased 
with the ideas intended to be conveyed by them, although 
I do not know precisely what they are. 

Peace, my dear sir, was formerly thought a good sort of 
thing ; but within these few years past it seems to have been 
going fast out of fashion. But, to be serious, there seems 
to be something more than common at work in, or on the

human mind, and urging it to enterprise, tending to intro- 
duce a new state of things. Symptoms of it appear more 
or less, and in differenl degrees, in all parts of Europe — 
even in Spain, where quiescency in every sense has long 
been cherished. Geneva is at this moment undergoing 
another revolution; where next, no one can tell. Our 
country may catch the flame. We live in an eventful 
season. We have nothing to do but our duty, and one 
part of it is to prepare for every event. Let us preserve 
peace while it can be done with propriety; and if in that we 
fail, let us wage war, not in newspapers and impotent sar- 
casms, but with manly firmness, and unanimous and vigor- 
ous efforts. 

I have had the pleasure of seeing your brother frequently, 
and am pleased with him. He is gone to Scotland. He 
has communicated to me a circumstance that I rejoice in. 

Assure Mrs. Read of my best wishes. With real esteem 
and regard, I am, dear sir, 

Your most obedient and humble servant,

FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Philadelphia, August 30th, 1794. 
My dear Sir, 
Your letter of the 23d of June, from London, and dupli- 
cate, have both been received ; and your safe ai rival, after 
so short a passage, gave sincere pleasur \ as well on private 
as on public account, to all your friends in this country, and 
to none in a greater degree, I can venture to assure you, 
than it did to myself. 

As you will receive letters from the secretary of state's 
office, giving an official account of public occurrences as 
they have arisen and progressed, it is unnecessary for me 
to retouch any of them; and yet I cannot restrain myself 
from making some observations on the most recent of them, 

VOL. II. F F 



226 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

the communication of which was received this morning 
only. I mean the protest of the governor of Upper Canada 
(delivered by Lieut. Sheaffe), against our occupying lands 
far from any of the posts, which, long ago, they ought to 
have surrendered, and far within the known, and until now, 
the acknowledged limits of the United States. 

On this irregular and high-handed proceeding of Mr. 
Simcoe, which is no longer masked, I would rather hear 
what the ministry of Great Britain will say, than pronounce 
my own sentiments thereon. But can that government, or 
will it attempt, after this official act of one of their governors, 
to hold out ideas of friendly intentions towards the United 
States, and suffer such conduct to pass with impunity? 

This may be considered as the most open and daring act 
of the British agents in America, though it is not the most 
hostile or cruel ; for there does not remain a doubt, in the 
mind of any well-informed person in this country (not shut 
against conviction), that all the difficulties we encounter 
with the Indians, their hostilities, the murders of helpless 
women and innocent children along our frontiers, result 
from the conduct of the agents of Great Britain in this 
country. In vain is it, then, for its administration, in Britain, 
to disavow having given orders which will warrant such 
conduct, while their agents go unpunished, while we have 
a thousand corroborating circumstances, and indeed almost 
as many evidences (some of which cannot be brought for- 
ward), to prove that they are seducing from our alliances 
(endeavouring to remove them over the line) tribes that 
have hitherto been kept in peace and friendship with us, at 
a heavy expense, and who have no cause of complaint, except 
pretended ones of their own creating ; while they keep in a 
state of irritation the tribes who are hostile to us, and insti- 
gating those who know little of us, or we of them, to unite 
in the war against us ; and while it is an undeniable fact that 
they are furnishing the whole with arms, ammunition, 
clothing, and even provisions to carry on the war, I might 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDED n. 227 

go further and, if they arc not much belied, add men also, 
in disguise. 

Can it be expected, I ask, so long as these things are 
known in the United States, or at least firmly believed, 
and suffered with impunity by Great Britain, that there ever 
will, or can be any cordiality between the two countries? 
I answer no : and I will undertake, \\ ithout the gift of pro- 
phecy, to predict, that it will be impossible to keep this 
country in a state of amity with Great Britain long, if the 
posts are not surrendered. A knowledge of these being 
my sentiments would have little weight, I am persuaded, 
with the British administration, nor, perhaps, with the nation, 
in effecting the measure ; but both may rest satisfied that, 
if they want to be in peace with this country, and want to 
enjoy the benefits of its trade, &c, this is the road to it — 
withholding them, and the consequences we feel at present 
continuing, war inevitably. 

This letter is written to you in extreme haste, while the 
papers respecting this subject are copying at the secretary 
of state's office, to go by express to New- York, for a vessel 
which we have just heard sails to-morrow ; you will readily 
perceive, therefore, I had no time for digesting, and as little 
for correcting it. I shall only add that you may be assured 
always of the sincere friendship and affection of 

Your obedient humble servant,

to alexander hamilton. 

London, 11th July, 1794. 
My dear Sir, 
I am still unable to say any thing decisive relative to the 
objects of my mission. Appearances continue to be singu- 
larly favourable, but appearances merit only a certain 
degree of circumspect reliance. The delays occasioned by 
the new arrangement of the ministry cannot be of long 
continuance. Circumstances must soon constrain them to 



228 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

form some ultimate system relative to the United States ; 
and although I have much reason to hope it will be favour- 
able to our wishes, yet I confess I am not without appre- 
hensions, that certain points not by us to be yielded, will 
occasion difficulties hard to surmount. Personally, I have 
every reason to - be satisfied, and officially, I have as yet no 
reason to complain. 

Shortly after my arrival, I dined with Lord Grenville. 
The cabinet ministers were present, but not a single for- 
eigner. On Monday next I am to dine with the lord- 
chancellor, and on next Friday with Mr. Pitt. I mention 
these facts to explain what I mean by favourable appear- 
ances. I think it best that they should remain unmentioned 
for the present, and they make no part of my communica- 
tions to Mr. Randolph or others. This is not the season 
for such communications ; they may be misinterpreted, 
though not by you. 

I fear the posts may labour, but they must not be left. 
We must not make a delusive settlement ; that would dis- 
unite our peop-c, and leave seeds of discord to germinate. 
I will do every thing that prudence and integrity may dic- 
tate or permit. 

I will endeavour to accommodate rather than dispute ; 
and if this plan should fail, decent and firm representations 
must conclude the business of my mission. As vet, I do 
not regret any step I have taken. I wish I may be able to 
say the same at the conclusion. 

Yours, affectionately, 

John Jay.

MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 229 



TO ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

London, 17th September, 1794. 
Dear Sin, 

I had last week the pleasure of receiving from you a few 
lines by Mr. Blaney. You will receive this letter by the 
hands of Mr. Morris. He will also be the bearer of my 
despatches to Mr. Randolph. They will be voluminous, 
particular, and. in many respects, interesting. It should not 
be forgotten that there is irritation here as well as in 
America, and that our party processions, toasts, rejoicings, 
&c. &c, have not been well calculated to produce good- 
will and good-humour. The government, nevertheless, 
distinguish between national acts and party effusions, and 
have entertained hitherto an opinion and belief that the 
president and our government and nation in general, were 
really desirous of an amicable settlement of differences, 
and of laying a foundation for friendship as well as peace 
between the two countries. 

The secretary's letters by Mr. Monroe, and his speech 
on his introduction to the Convention, have appeared in the 
English papers. Their impression in this country may 
easily be conjectured. I wish they had both been more 
guarded. The language of the United States at Paris and 
London should correspond with their neutrality. These 
things are not favourable to my mission. A speedy con- 
clusion to the negotiation is problematical, though not highly 
improbable. If I should be able to conclude the business 
on admissible terms, I shall do it and risk consequences, 
rather than by the delay of waiting fur and governing myself 
by opinions and instructions, hazard a change in the dispo- 
sition of this court ; for it seems our country, or rather some 
part- of it, will not forbear asperities. I hear that Virginia 
is taking British property by escheat ; and other things 
which in the present moment are unseasonable, are here 
reported. 



230 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

As the proposed articles are under consideration — as they 
have already undergone some alterations, and as I am not 
without hopes of other and further amendments, I really 
think they ought not to be published in their present crude 
state, especially as in the course of a few weeks I expect 
to be able to communicate their ultimate form. If they 
should not appear to me to be such as I ought to sign, I 
will transmit them, and wait for further instructions. 

Adieu, my dear sir, 

Yours, sincerely, 

John Jay. 

to n. crlger, esq. 

London, 11th September, 1794. 

Dear Sir, 

A gentleman in Holland has been so obliging as to send 
me a plan to make my fortune, even to the extent of many 
millions of pounds sterling. It unfortunately happens that 
more mercantile knowledge is necessary to the execution 
of this plan than I possess ; so that, like many others, I 
must go without a fortune for want of knowing how to 
get one. That, my good friend, is not your case ; having 
already made one fortune, you certainly know better how 
to make another than a person who has never made any. 

You will find this golden plan enclosed. If the extensive 
concerns in which you are already engaged should render 
its magnitude inconvenient, might it not be well to let our 
friends Le Roy and Bayard share in it ? I mention them, 
because I esteem and like them, and because their acquaint- 
ance with the commerce of Holland, and their connexions 
in that country, would afford facilities to all parties. 

At any rate, give me credit for good-will. If this plan 
does not make you more rich, it will not make you less 
merry ; and mirth sometimes does a man as much good as 
money.

Present my best compliments to Mrs. Cruger. With 
sincere wishes for your and her health and happiness, 

I am, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and humble servant, 

John Jay. 

P.S. The address of my correspondent is (in his own 
words) Mynheer de Heer Dirk Van Beest, op de Voor 
Straat de Dordrecht. 

TO ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

London, 17th September, 1794. 

Dear Sir, 

There is something very pleasant in the reflection, that 
while war, discord, and oppression triumph in so many 
parts of Europe, their domination does not extend to our 
country. I sometimes flatter myself that Providence, in 
compassion to the afflicted in these countries, will continue 
to leave America in a proper state to be an asylum to them. 

Among those who have suffered severely from these 
evils, is Monsieur De Rochefoucauld Liancourt, formerly 
president of the National Assembly of France. His rank 
and character are known to you. He will be the bearer of 
this letter, and I am persuaded that his expectations from 
it will be realized. 

Yours, sincerely, 

John Jay.

Philadelphia, November 1st, 1794. 

My dear Sir, 

On Tuesday last, I returned from my tour to the west- 
ward. On Monday, Congress by adjournment are to meet; 
and on the day following, Mr. Bayard, according to his 
present expectation, is to leave this city for London. 



232 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

Thus circumstanced (having so little time between my 
return and the opening of the session, to examine papers, 
and to prepare my communications for the Legislature), 
you will readily perceive that my present address to you 
must be hurried ; at the same time, my friendship and re- 
gard for you would not let an opportunity so good as the 
one afforded by Mr. Bayard, pass without some testimony 
of my remembrance, and an acknowledgment of the re- 
ceipt of your private letters to me, dated the 23d of June, 
21st of July, and 5th and 11th of August. These compre- 
hend all the letters I have received from you since your 
arrival in England to the present date. 

That of the 5th of August dawns more favourably upon 
the success of your mission than any that had preceded it, 
and for the honour, dignity, and interest of this country; 
for your own reputation and glory ; and for the peculiar 
satisfaction I should derive from it, as well on private as 
on public considerations, no man more ardently wishes you 
complete success than I do. But, as you have observed in 
some of your letters, that it is hardly possible in the early 
stages of a negotiation to foresee all the results, so much 
depending upon fortuitous circumstances, and incidents 
which are not within our control, — so to deserve success, by 
employing the means with which we are possessed to the 
best advantage, and trusting the event to the all-wise Dis- 
poser, is all that an enlightened public, and the virtuous 
and well-disposed part of the community can reasonably 
expect ; nor in this, will they, I am sure, be disappointed. 
Against the malignancy of the discontented, the turbulent, 
and the vicious, no abilities, no exertions, nor the most un- 
shaken integrity are any safeguard. 

As far as depends upon the executive, measures prepara- 
tory for the worst, while it hopes for the best, will be pur- 
sued; and I shall endeavour to keep things in statu quo, 
until your negotiation assumes a more decisive form, which 
I hope will soon be the case, as there are many hot heads 



. MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 233 

and impetuous spirits among us, who with difficulty can be 
kept within bounds. This, however, ought not to precipi- 
tate your conduct ; for, as it has been observed, " there is a 
tide in human affairs," which ought to be watched; and 
because I believe all who are acquainted with you will 
readily concede, that considerations both public and private 
combine to urge you to bring your mission to a close, with 
as much celerity as the nature of it will admit. 

As you have been, and will continue to be fully informed 
by the secretary of state of all transactions of a public 
nature, which relate to or may have an influence on the 
points of your mission, it would be unnecessary for me to 
touch upon any of them in this letter, was it not for the 
presumption that the insurrection in the western counties of 
this State has excited much speculation, and a variety of 
opinions abroad ; and will be represented differently ac- 
cording to the wishes of some, and the prejudices of others, 
who may exhibit it as an evidence of what has been pre- 
dicted, "that we are unable to govern ourselves." Under 
this view of the subject, I am happy in giving it to you as 
the general opinion, that this event having happened at the 
time it did was fortunate, although it will be attended with 
considerable expense. 

That the self-created societies which have spread them- 
selves over this country, have been labouring incessantly to 
sow the seeds of distrust, jealousy, and of course discon- 
tent, thereby hoping to effect some revolution in the govern- 
ment, is not unknown to you. That they have been the 
fomenters of the western disturbances, admits of no doubt in 
the mind of any one who will examine their conduct ; but, 
fortunately, they precipitated a crisis for which they were 
not prepared ; and thereby have unfolded views which will , 
I trust, effectuate their annihilation sooner than it might 
otherwise have happened ; at the same time, that it has 
afforded an occasion for the people of this country to show 
their abhorrence of the result, and their attachment to the 

VOL. II. — G G 



234 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

constitution and the laws : for I believe that five times the 
number of militia that was required would have come for- 
ward, if it had been necessary, in support of them. 

The spirit which blazed out on this occasion, as soon as 
the object was fully understood, and the lenient measures 
of the government were made known to the people, de- 
serve to be communicated ; for there are instances of gen- 
eral officers going at the head of a single troop and light 
companies ; of field officers, when they came to the places 
of rendezvous and found no command for them in that 
grade, turning into the ranks and proceeding as private 
soldiers under their own captains ; and of numbers, pos- 
sessing the first fortunes in the country, standing in the 
ranks as private men, and marching day by day, with their 
knapsacks and haversacks at their backs ; sleeping on 
straw with a single blanket in a soldier's tent, during the 
frosty nights we have had, by way of example to others. 
Nay, more, of many young Quakers (not discouraged by 
the elders) of the first characters, families, and properties, 
having turned into the ranks, and marching with the troops. 

These things have terrified the insurgents, who had no 
conception that such a spirit prevailed ; but while the thun- 
der only rumbled at a distance, were boasting of their 
strength, and wishing for and threatening the militia by 
turns ; intimating, that the arms they should take from them 
would soon become a magazine in their hands. Their lan- 
guage is much changed indeed, but their principles want 
correction. 

I shall be more prolix, in my speech to Congress, on the 
commencement and progress of this insurrection, than is 
usual in such an instrument, or than I should have been on 
any other occasion ; but as numbers (at home and abroad) 
will hear of the insurrection, and will read the speech, that 
may know nothing of the documents to which it might refer, 
I conceived it would be better to encounter the charge of 
prolixity, by giving a cursory detail of facts (that would 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 235 

show the prominent features of the thing), than to let it go 
naked into the world, to be dressed up according to the 
fancy or inclination of the readers, or the policy of our 
enemies. 

I write nothing in answer to the letter of Mr. Wangen- 
heim (enclosed by you to me). Were I to enter into cor- 
respondences of that sort (admitting there was no impro- 
priety in the measure), I should be unable to attend to my 
ordinary duties. I have established it as a maxim, neither 
to invite nor to discourage emigrants. My opinion is, that 
they will come hither as fast as the true interest and policy 
of the United States will be benefited by foreign popula- 
tion. I believe many of these, as Mr. Wangenheim relates, 
have been, and I fear will continue to be, imposed upon by 
speculators in land and other things. But I know of no 
prevention but caution, nor any remedy except the laws. 
A T or is military, or other employment, so easy to obtain as 
foreigners conceive, in a country where oiiiccs and the 
seekers of them bear no proportion to each other.

to oliver ellsworth. 

London, 19th November, 1794. 

Dear Sir, 

The negotiation is terminated by a treaty. It will, with 
this letter, go by the packet, which, in expectation of this 
event, has been detained above a week. 

In my opinion we have reason to be satisfied. It is 
expedient that the ratification should not be unnecessarily 
delayed. The best disposition towards us prevails in the 
cabinet, and I hope they will have reason to be content 
with the delicacy and propriety of our conduct towards 
them and the nation. Further concessions on the part of 
Great Britain cannot, in my opinion, be attained. The 



236 LIFE OP JOHN JAY. 

minister flatters himself that this treaty will be very accept- 
able to our country, and that some of the articles in it will 
be received as unequivocal proofs of good-will. We have 
industriously united our efforts to remove difficulties, and 
few men would have persevered in such a dry, perplexing 
business, with so much patience and temper as he has 
done. 

I could write you a long letter on these topics, but I 
have not time. Believe me to be, with great esteem and 
regard, dear sir, 

Your most obedient and humble servant, 

John Jay. 

to geokge washington. 

London, 19th November, 1794. 

Dear Sir, 

A letter which I wrote tcyou on the 29th October last, 
contained the following paragraph, viz. : 

" I am authorized by Lord Grenville to assure you, in the 
most explicit terms, that no instructions to stimulate or 
promote hostilities by the Indians against the United States, 
have been sent to the king's officers in Canada. I am pre- 
paring an official representation to him on this subject, and 
he will give me an official answer to it ; but as this cannot 
be done in season to forward by this vessel (for letters after 
this day will be too late to go by her), his lordship has 
permitted me to make this informal communication to you 
for your satisfaction. I am to lay before him a statement 
of the evidences relative to the interferences complained 
of, to the end that it may be sent to Canada, and strict 
inquiry made into the truth of the allegations and facts in 
question." 

My time and thoughts have ever since continued to be 
so entirely engrossed by the treaty which is now concluded, 
and was this day signed, as that it really has not been in 
my power to finish and present this representation. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 237 

As to the treaty, it must speak for itself. A hasty letter 
which I have written to Mr. Randolph, contains some 
remarks on a few of the articles in it. That letter is far 
from being so particular as L could wish, but I cannot help 
it. My whole time has been employed. To do more was 
not possible. I wish that I could accompany the treaty, but 
I feel that I ought not to expose myself to the severities of 
a winter's voyage. 

I am exceedingly anxious to return ; for although I have 
every other reason to be satisfied with my situation, yet I 
am not at home. I ought not to conceal from you, that the 
confidence reposed in your personal character was visible 
and useful throughout the negotiation. 

If there is noc a good disposition in the far greater part 
of the cabinet and nation towards us, I am exceedingly 
deceived. I do not mean an ostensible and temporizing, 
but a real good disposition. I wish it may have a fair trial. 
With perfect respect, esteem, and attachment, 

I am, dear sir, 
Your obliged and obedient servant, 

John Jay. 

to alexander hamilton. 

London, 19th November, 1794. 
My dear Sir, 

My task is done ; whether finis coronat opus, the presi- 
dent, senate, and public will decide. 

This letter goes by the packet, and the treaty with it ; 
some parts of it require elucidation to common readers. I 
have not time for comments ; Lord Grenville is anxious to 
dismiss the packet ; I therefore write in haste. If this treaty 
fails, I despair of another. If satisfactory, care should be 
taken that the public opinion be not misled respecting it, for 
this reason the sooner it is ratified and published the better. 
I really think the good disposition of this country should be 
cherished. I came here in the moment of exultation and 



238 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

triumph on account of Lord Howe's victory. From that 
day to this I have experienced no change in sentiments or 
conduct relative to the negotiation. I must, though not 
without reluctance, conclude; not being fit for a winter 
voyage, I shall stay here till spring. Indeed, I shall want 
repairs before I am quite fit for any voyage. God bless you. 

Yours, 

John Jay. 

to rufus king. 

London, 19th November, 1794. 
Dear Sir, 
I send by the packet the fruit of my negotiation — a treaty. 
I wish that I could go with it, as well that I might again be 
in my own country, as that I might answer questions on 
the subject. The draught has undergone several editions, 
with successive alterations, additions, &c. This shows 
that time and trouble have not been spared. I have just 
finished a hasty letter to Mr. Randolph. It will be thought 
slovenly, but I cannot help it. The packet must go. If I 
entirely escape censure, I shall be agreeably disappointed. 
Should the treaty prove, as I believe it will, beneficial to 
our country, justice will finally be done. If not, be it so — 
my mind is at ease : I wish I could say as much for my 
body, but the rheumatism will not permit me. Health and 
happiness to you, my good friend. 

Yours, sincerely, 

John Jay.

[Private.] 

Philadelphia, Dec. 18th, 1794. 

My Dear Sir, 
Since writing to you, by Mr. Bayard, about the first of 
November, I have been favoured with your letters of the 
13th September and 2d of October. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 239 

As the sentiments contained in the first of these, respect- 
ing the communications of Mr. Monroe to the National 
Convention of France, were also transmitted in a private 
letter from you to the secretary of state, and replied to by 
him (both of which I have seen), I shall dwell no longer on 
that subject, than just to observe, 1st, that considering the 
place in which the}" won' delivered, and the neutral policy 
this country had resolved to pursue, it was a measure that 
does not appear to have been well devised by our minister : 
2dly, aware of this himself, and that his conduct would be 
criticised, he has assigned reasons for its adoption ; a sum- 
mary of which is, that the navy officers and privateers- 
men of France, who had resorted to our ports and had been 
laid under such restrictions as neutral policy required from 
us, although disagreeable to them, had represented this 
country (and not without effect) as unfriendly to the French 
revolution; to do away which he found himself necessitated 
to counteract them, by strong assurances of the good dis- 
positions of the people of these United States towards that 
nation : and 3dly, although I think with you that in order 
to accomplish this he has stepped beyond the true line, yet, 
under the then existing circumstances, the expression of 
such reciprocal good will was susceptible of two views, one 
of which, even in the pending state of the negotiation (by 
alarming as well as offending the British ministry), might 
have no unfavourable operation in bringing matters to a 
happy and speedy result, than which nothing is more desir- 
able, or can be more ardently wished for by the friends of 
peace and good order in this country. 

As the secretary of state has written to you several 
times since the receipt of your statement of the negotiation 
on the 13th of September, I shall add nothing to the ob- 
servations which are contained in his letters on the subject 
thereof. 

The business of the session, hitherto, has been tranquil ; 
and I perceive nothing at this time to make it otherwise, 



240 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

unless the result of the negotiation (which is anxiously ex- 
pected by all) should produce divisions. As yet, no details 
have been handed to Congress on this subject ; indeed, no 
communication of that business has been made to anybody, 
except those immediately about me in the executive de- 
partments. 

The Virginia escheats of British property do not, as I 
am informed, stand upon the ground as related to you ; but 
as I am not accurately enough read in the law respecting 
these escheats to be precise in my recital of it, I will re- 
quest the secretary of state to give you the principles 
thereof. 

As I expected, and as you have been informed the result 
would probably be, so it has happened, that the western 
insurrection has terminated highly honourable for this coun- 
try ; which, by the energy of its laws, and the good dis- 
positions of its citizens, has brought the rioters to a per- 
fect sense of their duty, without shedding a drop of blood. 
In the eyes of foreigners among us, this affair stands in a 
high point of respectability. With great truth, I remain, 

Dear sir, 

Your affectionate, 

George Washington. 

to tench coxe. 

London, 18th December, 1794. 

Dear Sir, 
Accept my thanks for your obliging letter of the 8th of 
last month, and for the book which accompanied it. As 
yet, I have not had time to give it that regular and attentive 
perusal which it appears to merit. It certainly contains 
much interesting information, and from your accuracy, I 
presume that the facts and statements in it are correct. It 
will naturally lead both our own people and foreigners to 
form a favourable and just estimate of the United States, 
and show in a strong light the policy of maintaining that 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 241 

respect for our government and laws, without which our 
local and other advantages can neither be enjoyed nor 
improved. 

The manner in which the insurrection has been dissi- 
pated gives me pleasure ; and there is reason to hope that 
the arts and counsels which produced it, will not be able 
to operate such another. 

Our affairs relative to this country have a promising 
aspect. The best disposition towards us prevails here, and 
the indications and proofs of it daily increase. I do really 
believe, that this government means to give conciliatory 
measures with the United States a full and fair trial. I 
wish it may be reciprocated on our part. It never can be 
wise to cast ourselves into the arms and influence of any 
nation ; but certainly it is wise and proper to cherish the 
good-will of those who wish to be on terms of friendship 
and cordiality with us. It may seem strange, and yet I am 
convinced, that next to the king, our president is more pop- 
ular in this country than any man in it. 

With the best wishes, and with sentiments of esteem and 
regard, I am, dear sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

John Jay. 

to david hartley. 

London, 8th Jan., 1795. 

Dear Sir, 
Accept my thanks for the pamphlet you was so obliging 
as to send me. It does not appear probable to me that 
Europe is very speedily to be blessed with a general and 
lasting peace, or that the period has already arrived when 
reason and virtue will govern the conduct of the mass of 
mankind. There is much reason to believe that the ma- 
jority of men are neither reasonable nor virtuous ; and hence 
it has happened, that so many systems which were calcu- 

VOL. II. H H 



242 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

lated on the supposed prevalence of reason and virtue, have 
proved delusive. 

The time, doubtless, will come, and is approaching, when 
a new order of things will be introduced, and when, as the 
human passions and vices cease to predominate, the checks 
necessary to control them will become proportionably less 
necessary. To see things as being what they are, to esti- 
mate then i accurately, and to act accordingly, are requisites 
no less essential to sound politics than to sound philosophy 
or religion. 

These are general remarks, and not made with reference 
to the political questions agitating in this kingdom, and with 
which (being a citizen of another country) it would not 
become me to interfere. With the best wishes for your 
health and happiness, I am, dear sir, 

Your friend and obedient servant, 

John Jay.

Hague, January 9th, 1795, 
Dear Sir, 

Nothing could be more grateful to my feelings, than the 
intelligence from America which you are pleased to com- 
municate. The suppression of the insurrection, the return 
of conciliatory dispositions, the growing prosperity of com- 
merce, and the prevalence of national principles, demon- 
strated by the re-election of good men for the ensuing 
legislature, are all promising indications that our country 
will yet be flourishing, united, and happy. 

The friendly dispositions, of which the result of your late 
negotiation, and your observations since that period have 
tended to confirm your opinion, give us an additional 
ground of satisfaction. It may be expected that the treaty 
has by this time arrived in America. Jt is my cordial wish 
and hope, that it will be received with a temper similar to 



AM-( ELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 243 

that which formed and acceded to its arrangements; with 
that combination of firmness and of generosity, which is so 
well calculated to terminate with honour air foreign differ- 
ences, and which has so happily succeeded in suppressing 
interna] dissension. 

The value of peace and neutrality is nowhere move for- 
cibly felt, than at this moment in the country where I am. 
Its situation becomes more and more critical from day to 
day. In the terrible agitation between the dismal alterna- 
tive of conquest or civil war, it. feels at the same moment, 
all the terrors of a torrent rushing from without, and a vol- 
cano bursting from within. 

The alarm at this place is great. The emigrants who 
have the means are hurrying away. The British ambas- 
sador has gone to meet the future Princess of Wales. The 
Spanish, Portuguese, and Prussian ministers are gone. 
But the stadtholder and his family still remain, determined, 
it is said, to stay at all events and partake of the common 
destiny. There is yet no intelligence from the commis- 
sioners gone to Paris. Some hopes are still entertained of 
their success, which are strengthened by the moderate and 
rainy weather, which will impede, for the moment, the far- 
ther progress of the French armies. 

Requesting you to present my cordial remembrance to 
Col. Trumbull, and to your son, I remain, with every senti- 
ment of respect and attachment, dear sir, 

Your very humble and obedient servant, 

John Q. Adams. 

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

[Private.] 

London, 25th February, 1795. 
Dear Sik, 
Your very friendly letter of the 1st November last, gra- 
tified me not a little. The insurrections had caused disa- 
greeable sensations in this country. The objects and efforts 



244 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

of the Jacobin societies in America were well known here ; 
and the fate of our government was considered as being 
involved in that of the insurrection. The manner in which 
it has terminated has given sincere satisfaction to this gov- 
ernment, to whom all disorganizing innovations give alarm. 
Their confidence in your wisdom, decision, and energy has 
been confirmed by the event. 

The institution and influence of such societies among us 
had given me much concern, and I was happy in perceiving 
that the suppression of the insurrection, together with the 
character and fall of similar ones in France, would proba- 
bly operate the extinction of these mischievous associations 
in America. 

Your remarks relative to my negotiations are just and 
kind, and I assure you nothing on my part has been want- 
ing to render the conclusion of them as consonant as was 
possible to your expectations and wishes. 

Perfectly apprized both of my duty and responsibility, I 
determined not to permit my judgment to be influenced by 
any considerations but those of public good, under the direc- 
tion of my instructions. / knew and know that no attain- 
able settlement or treaty would give universal satisfaction ; 
and I am far from expecting that the one I have signed 
will not administer occasion for calumny and detraction. 

These are evils, which they who serve the people will 
always meet with. Demagogues will constantly flatter 
the passions and prejudices of the multitude, and will never 
cease to employ improper arts against those who will not 
be their instruments. I have known many demagogues, 
but I have never known one honest man among them. 

These are among the other evils which are incident to 
human life, and none of them shall induce me to decline or 
abandon any pursuits, in which I may conceive it to be my 
duty to embark or persevere. All creatures will act ac- 
cording to their nature, and it is absurd to expect that a 
man who is not upright, will act like one who is. The 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. vMf» 

time will come when all books, and histories, and errors 
will be consumed, and when from their ashes truth only 
will rise, and prevail, and be immortal. 

Among my despatches to Mr. Randolph by this ship, is 
a copy of a letter I have received from Mr. Monroe at 
Paris, and of two which I have written to him. The expe- 
diency of correcting the mistakes which the French Con- 
vention seem to have imbibed, will doubtless strike you. 

Be pleased to present my best compliments to Mrs. 
Washington, and be assured of the perfect respect, esteem, 
and attachment, with which I am, dear sir, 

Your obliged and affectionate servant, 

John Jay,

[Private.] 

London, 6th March, 1795. 

Dear Sir, 
After considering all that I have heard and seen on the 
subject, it is my opinion that the common and popular (not 
official) language of America, relative to Great Britain, 
manifested such a disposition as to create serious appre- 
hensions in this country that we should join with the French 
in the war ; that these apprehensions gave occasion to 
secret designs, calculated on such an event ; that in pro- 
portion as your views and counsels became developed, 
these apprehensions gradually subsided ; that my mission 
was regarded as a strong proof of your desire to preserve 
peace, and that the perfect and universal confidence reposed 
in your personal character, excluded every doubt of your 
being sincere ; and that this government is not yet entirely 
convinced that a pacific and conciliatory system will be 
supported by the inclination and correspondent conduct of 
the great body of the people. Various circumstances, 
however, induce me to believe, that the cabinet ultimately 
determined to give conciliation a fair experiment, by doing 



246 LIFE OP JOHN JAY. 

us substantial justice, and by consenting to such arrange- 
ments favourable to us, as the national interests and habitual 
prejudices would admit. To relax the navigation act was 
to alarm these prejudices, and therefore was a measure 
which required caution and circumspection, especially in 
the first instance. To break the ice was the difficulty. To 
enlarge the aperture afterward would be more easy ; and 
it will probably be done, if we should be reasonably tem- 
perate and prudent. To admit us into their East and West 
India dominions, and into all their continental American 
territories, under any modifications, were decided deviations 
from their former policy, and tended to shock ancient pre- 
judices. Yet these things have been done. None but a 
strong administration would have ventured it. These are 
offerings to conciliation, and include, though not confessedly, 
satisfaction to our claims of justice. 

What passed at Paris on Mr. Monroe's arrival, I am 
persuaded made a strong and disagreeable impression; and 
had not your private character prevented those transac- 
tions from being imputable in any degree to your orders, I 
do believe that the system of conciliation would have been 
instantly abandoned. 

What would have succeeded it cannot be easily conjec- 
tured ; certainly no treat}' so favourable to us as the pres- 
ent would then have been attainable. Whatever the 
American opinion of it may prove to be, the administration 
here think it very friendly to us ; and that it could not in 
the present moment have been made more so, without 
exciting great discontents and uneasiness in this country. 

The present situation of Great Britain may to us and 
others appear to be perilous, but the ministry seem to have 
no such fears. They have been uniformly bent on prose- 
cuting the war with vigour, and since my arrival I have 
observed no change in that resolution. Even a distin- 
guished leader in the opposition lately told me, that the 
French could not possibly injure the vitals of this country. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 247 

Let it be infatuation or what it will, the government and 
the great majority of this nation meant and mean to con- 
tinue tin 1 war. I will mention a striking anecdote. 

^i ou have doubtless heard that the merchants concerned 
in the American trade gave me a dinner. The principal 
cabinet ministers were present, and about two hundred mer- 
chants. Many toasts were given. "When the "President of 
the United States" was given, it was proposed to be with 
three cheers, but they were prolonged (as if by preconcert, 
but evidently not so) to six. Several other toasts passed 
with great acclamation, particularly " The wooden walls of 
Old England ;" almost every toast referable to America, and 
manifesting a desire of conciliation and cordiality, met with 
general and strong marks of approbation. Towards the 
conclusion of the feast, I was asked for a toast; I gave a 
neutral one, viz., "A safe and honourable peace to all the 
belligerent powers ;" you cannot conceive how coldly it 
was received, and though civility induced them to give it 
three cheers, yet they were so faint and single, as most 
decidedly to show that peace was not the thing they washed, 
— these were merchants. Mr. Pinckney was struck as 
forcibly by it as I was ; and we both drew the same con- 
clusions from it. 

Except an inconsiderable number, the men of rank and 
property, and all whom they can influence throughout the 
kingdom, think the war is indispensable to their safety. 
The dread of Jacobin politics and Jacobin scenes, and the 
expectation that the pecuniary resources of this country 
will ultimately render them superior in the contest, appear 
to be their prevailing motives. 

It was expected by some, that the loss of Holland would 
have damped this spirit, it has had only a partial effect. 
We find the ministry and parliament have been stimulated 
by it to greater efforts. 

All the members who voted for what are called the pacific 
resolutions were not moved, as many of them certainlv

were, by a mere desire of peace, but by the policy of pro- 
fessing a readiness to make peace, in order that, if spurned 
by the French, the nation might continue in the war with 
more constancy and unanimity. They did not suppose 
that an acceptable peace could, in the present moment, be 
obtained. 

This people appear to think their constitution, and prop- 
erty, and national character and importance as being all at 
stake, and on that stake to be inflexibly determined to risk 
every thing. 

Of the great number who advocated a reform in parlia- 
ment, there is a portion (but how great cannot easily be 
ascertained) who are so sore, and mortified, and vexed, that 
in my opinion the French successes give them as much 
pleasure as pain. There are men among them whose designs 
as well as whose fortunes are desperate, as well as men 
who have honest designs and good fortunes. These people 
are at present kept from action by the energy of the gov- 
ernment, and the unanimity of the great majority of the 
nation as to the necessity of the war. 

The French Jacobins have greatly injured the cause of 
rational liberty. The detestable massacres, impieties, and 
abominations imputable to them, excited in the people here 
the most decided hatred and abhorrence ; and the govern- 
ment by that circumstance rendered the war popular. But 
the system of moderation and justice lately adopted in 
France, the suppression of the Jacobins, and the strict dis- 
cipline observed in their armies, will doubtless have an 
influence on the sentiments of this nation. I think I see 
traces of this influence already, on minds not suspected 
of it. 

The present war system, however, strikes me as being 
less firm, consolidated, and formidable than it appears to be. 
The administration has been composed more with a view 
to the conciliation of parties than the efficiency of measures. 
I think the system is liable to fluctuation and derangement ; 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 249 

from a variety of events and circumstances. Opposition 
to reform, as leading to innovations, is doubtless carried too 
far, and may produce serious consequences. Ideas of the 
rights of man, and the inferences deducible from them, are 
spreading among the people. Veneration for royalty, ab- 
stractedly considered, has abated; and although the king 
is popular, yet it is said that the Prince of Wales and the 
Duke of York are not. The prosperity of Britain results 
from, and depends on many causes : complicated machines 
are most liable to derangement. Should there be a scarcity 
of corn, want of employment to the manufacturers, or sig- 
nal convulsions or disasters in the East or West Indies, or in 
Ireland, or on the sea, the government would find their task 
very arduous. Alarm and distress will abate pride and obsti- 
nacy; and when the multitude begin to feel severely, their 
passions frequently take a new and dangerous direction. 

The minister would, I think, have stood on stronger 
ground, if he had taken the first good opportunity of say- 
ing explicitly in the House of Commons, that it was France 
who declared war against Great Britain, and not Great 
Britain against France ; and that the government was dis- 
posed and ready to make peace whenever France would do 
it on terms compatible with honour and the essential interests 
of Great Britain. To put an enemy in the wrong is to ob- 
tain great advantages. The placing and so long continuing 
Lord Chatham at the head of the admiralty — the putting 
the Duke of York at the head of the army — the improper 
liberties taken with neutral nations, for which the Danes 
and Swedes on their part are not yet satisfied — the strange 
measures relative to Ireland, and many other things which 
strike me as blunders, indicate a defect either in the cabinet 
or in the minister. Although united as to the war, yet as 
to the mode of conducting it, the wisest counsels may not 
always prevail. Upon the whole, I shall be surprised if in 
the course of this war, Britain does not reap more thorns 
than laurels, 

VOL. II. — 1 1 



250 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

I have great reason to believe that the king, the cabinet, 
and nation were never more unanimous in any system than 
in that of conciliation with us ; even Lord Hawkesbury 
does not oppose it. If it should not succeed, they will 
naturally pass, like a pendulum, to the other extreme. 

This system rests principally on their confidence in the 
uprightness, independence, and wisdom of your conduct. 
No other man enjoys so completely the esteem and confi- 
dence of this nation as you do ; nor, except the king, is 
any one so popular. The idea which everywhere prevails 
is, that the quarrel between Britain and America w T as a 
family quarrel, and that it is time it should be made up. 
For my part, I am for making it up, and for cherishing this 
disposition on their part by justice, benevolence, and good 
manners on ours. To cast ourselves into the arms of this 
or any other nation would be degrading, injurious, and 
puerile : nor, in my opinion, ought we to have any political 
connexion with any foreign power. 

Before I came here, I had no idea that the king was so 
popular as he is ; his reign having been marked by national 
calamities produced by reprehensible measures. But his 
popularity is owing to his private, rather than his official 
character. As a man, there is much in him to commend ; 
and I have not heard any vice imputed to him. As a 
domestic man, affectionate and attentive to his queen and 
children, and affable to all about him, he is universally 
esteemed. Few men are so punctual in all things. He 
patronizes the arts and sciences. He pays uncommon 
attention to agriculture, and delights in his farms. He lays 
out about ten thousand pounds a-year in improving and 
embellishing the royal estates. He is industrious, sober, 
and temperate, and has acquired much various knowledge 
and information. He converses with ease, and often with 
adroitness, and has an uncommon memory ; they who 
ought to know him concur in these accounts. That he is a 
great and a wise king, I have not heard asserted. That he 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 251 

does (to use a vulgar expression) as well as lie knows how, 
seems not to be doubted; but yet some say, that he occa- 
sionally is cunning instead of being wise. I have heard 
him described as being a great man in little things ; and 
as being generally well-intentioned, pertinacious, and per- 
severing. 

I congratulate you and our country on the bloodless issue 
of the insurrection ; it is very reputable to the government, 
and to the people ; and exalts both in the estimation of this 
and other nations. 

The tranquillity of the present session of Congress is 
a pleasing circumstance ; but I suspect it has proceeded 
more from their having nothing to differ about, than from a 
spirit of forbearance, or a desire of unanimity. The result 
of my negotiations will doubtless produce fresh disputes, 
and give occasion to much declamation ; for / have no idea 
that the treaty will meet with anti-federal approbation. 
Besides, men are more apt to think of what they wish to 
have, than of what is in their power to obtain. How far 
the rejection of such a treaty would put the United States 
in the wrong ; whether it is consistent with our honour, 
engagements, and important interests ; whether it is 
preferable upon the whole to a war ; are questions which 
require much cool and deliberate consideration, as well as 
more information than many who will decide upon them 
possess. I regret not having had time to make my letter, 
which accompanied the treaty, more full, so as to have par- 
ticularized and explained the reasons which relate to the 
several articles in it. Then I had not leisure ; to have 
done it since would have been too late, as the fate of the 
treaty would probably be decided before subsequent letters 
could arrive. I still have thoughts of reducing them to 
writing ; and yet there are some among them which should 
not be published, lest the future measures, which they also 
respect, should be thereby marred. I allude, for instance, 
to the free navigation of the St. Lawrence. 



252 lilFE OF JOHN JAY. 

Mr. Randolph does not see the West India article in the 
same light that I do: it breaks the ice, that is, it breaks in 
upon the navigation act. The least stream from a mass 
oi' water passing through a bank will enlarge its passage. 
The very article stipulates that the arrangements to suc- 
ceed it shall have in view the further extension of com- 
merce. This should not be too nicely discussed in Ameri- 
can or English newspapers; for though liberal and enlight- 
ened people will admit such extensions of commerce to be 
beneficial to both countries, yet all ancient prejudices must 
be delicately managed. ■ There are many men who have 
less wisdom than pow r er, and more integrity than political 
information. The restriction not to carry certain articles 
to Europe, &c, is confined to the United States and the 
British islands. From other places, we may freely carry 
them. Deposites of French and Spanish sugars, &c, may 
be made in the Dutch, Danish, or other islands ; and thence 
carried where we please. English sugars, cotton, cocoa, 
and coffee will probably not be more than our consumption 
requires ; and all cotton brought into our country should be 
there manufactured. 

Thus, my dear sir, I have passed part of this day very 
agreeably in writing to you this long letter ; and the plea- 
sure is increased by the opportunity it affords me, of assur- 
ing you how cordially and sincerely I am 

Your obliged and affectionate friend and servant, 

John Jay. 

to doctor james anderson, edinburgh. 

London, 18th March, 1795. 

Sir, 
I have been favoured with yours of the 14th instant. It 
gives me pleasure to observe, that good-will towards 
America seems to prevail generally in this kingdom, and I 
hope the further progress of conciliation will not be retarded 
by indiscretions in either country. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 253 

Your sentiments, relative to the imperfections of human 
nature and human governments, are but too well founded. 
Governments calculated on an idea that the great majority 
of any people are reasonable and virtuous will, in many 
respects, prove detective. Governments calculated on the 
opposite extreme will be severe and oppressive. When 
it is considered that not only all who form plans of govern- 
ment, and all who govern, and all who are governed, are 
imperfect, but also that too many of them are neither wise 
nor virtuous, we cannot be surprised that political as well 
as moral evil should abound more or less in every part of the 
world. Perfection is beyond our reach; all that can be 
hoped for in this world is a state of the least imperfection. 

With the best wishes for your welfare, 

I have the honour to be, sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

John Jay. 

from lord g renville. 

London, May 11th, 1795, 

My dear Sir, 

I cannot resist the desire I feel of availing myself of the 
opportunity of the first packet since your departure, to 
express to you how happy you would make me by allow- 
ing me occasionally to recall to your recollection, in this 
manner, one who will always entertain for you the most 
sincere esteem and friendship. I am particularly anxious 
to hear of your safe arrival, and that you have found your 
family and friends well. These are points paramount to 
all other considerations ; but I know your return to your 
country will not be fully satisfactory to you, unless you 
have also found the state of public affairs such as to promise 
the continuance of good order and tranquillity. That it 
may be so no one more sincerely wishes than myself, and 
it would be a great satisfaction for me to hear it from you. 

Since you left us, the news of the arrival of the treaty in 



254 LIFE OP JOHN JAY. 

America has reached us. We were singularly unfortunate 
in the loss of the Tankenville packet. By a strange negli- 
gence, the November and December mails from hence were 
both put on board that ship, without our having any notice 
of it from the post-office ; so that while I thought we were 
sending duplicates by two different conveyances, we were 
in fact sending them by the same vessel. My letters to 
Governor Simcoe, which I have frequently mentioned to 
you, and my despatches to Mr. Hammond on the subject 
of the treaty, were on board the same ship ; so that this 
accident has thrown us far back in the arrangement of many 
material points. I hope, however, that with attention, and 
a continuance on the part of the two governments of the 
same disposition which actuated all our communications 
and negotiations here, the great work which we have begun 
will be carried to its full extent. 

I have not been inattentive to the points w T hich remain to 
be settled here. One of the most material is, I flatter my- 
self, in a train of being well arranged. I mean that which 
relates to the admiralty courts in the West Indies, which it 
is in contemplation immediately to diminish in point of 
number, so as to have them only at Jamaica, Barbadoes, 
Grenada, Antigua, and Martinique. Knowing, as I do, how 
much evil has been produced by the multiplication of these 
courts, I look to this reduction with very sanguine hopes. 
But I hope the regulation will not stop here, but that the 
effect of it may lead to render the practice of those which 
will remain more correct and cautious than I fear it has 
hitherto been. 

The impossibility of our receiving the ratification of the 
treaty till quite the end of July, leaves us no chance of 
being able to propose to parliament, during the present 
session, those matters connected with the treaty in which 
the interference of the legislature is necessary. I know 
that this delay will be misconstrued on your side of the 
water ; but it is unavoidable. I requested Mr. Pinckney, 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 255 

before he went to Spain, to write to America on this point, 
in order that the explanation of it might not rest merely on 
the communications of our minister there. You will be 
able to speak with still more knowledge and effect to the 
same point. Whatever does not depend on the repeal or 
alteration of existing laws, will be immediately executed on 
the receipt of the ratification. 

The public papers and other communications will inform 
you fully of the state of affairs in Europe. The dispositions 
of the people in France are evidently turning very fast to 
the establishment of some settled order, which may relieve 
them from the miseries of their present anarchy. In a 
similar situation in this country, we experienced the advan- 
tage of a known and moderate form of government under 
which the nation had before been happy, and to which, there- 
fore, it returned with enthusiasm and almost with unanimity. 
The want of such a standard to resort to is now, as far as 
I can judge, the great obstacle to the restoration of order in 
France, and, consequently, of peace in Europe. Mild as 
their old government was in its practice, it was attended 
with many circumstances the renewal of which creates 
great apprehension and uneasiness ; and there is no authority 
of sufficient weight to prescribe the form and limits of any 
change. Some of the belligerent powers are, as you will 
have seen, too impatient to wait the result of this doubtful 
issue. To others, all idea of peace which shall not give 
better security than the signature of the committee of 
safety, or the ratification of the convention, seems delusive 
and dangerous ; and to this sentiment I profess myself 
strongly inclined. You are happy in America if you can 
avoid, as I trust you will, the dangers both of the war and 
of the peace. 

With the sincerest wishes for your prosperity, 
Believe me, sir, 
Your most attached and faithful humble servant, 

Grenville.

My dear Sir, 

The enclosed contains my resignation of the office of 
chief-justice. I cannot quit it without again expressing to 
you my acknowledgments for the honour you conferred 
upon me by that appointment, and for the repeated marks 
of confidence and attention for which I am indebted to you. 
It gives me pleasure to recollect and reflect on these circum-

and happiness, and to assure you of the perfect respect, 
esteem, and attachment, with which

[Private.] 

Philadelphia, 31st August, 1795. 

My dear Sir, 

You will have learned from the public gazettes, and 
through other more authentic channels, that all that rested 
with me to do, to give ratification to the treaty between 
this country and Great Britain, is already accomplished. 

Mr. Pinckney's absence from the court of London, the 
information and aids it was expected he would derive from 
Mr. Short's presence at that of Madrid, the pecuniary situa- 
tion of our affairs in Holland requiring the attention of Mr. 
Adams in that country, and the little knowledge we had of 
the character and qualifications of Mr. Deas, have occasioned 
no little embarrassment in this business. However, a mode 
is adopted which, I hope, will be effectual. 

It has not been among the smallest of these embarrass- 
ments that the domineering spirit of Great Britain should 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 257 

revive just at this crisis, and the outrageous and insulting 
conduct of some of her officers should combine therewith, to 
play into the hands of the discontented, and sour the minds 
of those who are friends to peace, order, and friendship with 
all the world. But this by-the-bye. 

The object of this letter is to pray you to aid me with 
hints relative to those points which you conceive to be lit 
subjects for the further friendly negotiations on the West 
India trade with Great Britain, agreeably to the recom- 
mendation of the Senate ; and which appear to have been 
in contemplation by the concluding part of the treaty signed 
by yourself and Lord Grenville. 

I intended to have asked this favour of you at an earlier 
day ; but a coincidence of unexpected circumstances has 
involved me in so much business and perplexity, that it has 
been delaved from time to time (since my arrival in this 
city) until the present moment. But as nothing is now 
asked that you have not, I am sure, revolved over and 
over again during your negotiation, and sinee the decision 
of the Senate thereon, T persuade myself it will require but 
little time for the digest I ask ; and which I beg to receive 
as soon as you can make it convenient to give me, circum- 
stances rendering it necessary for me to leave this place, if 
possible, on Monday next, for Virginia, in order to bring 
back my family ; but instructions for the new negotiator 
must be prepared before I go. 

With great esteem and regard, 

I remain, my dear sir,

to george washington. 

New- York, 3d Sept., 1796. 

Dear Sir, 

I have been honoured with yours of the 31st of last month. 
The article in the treaty, to which you allude, viz. the last, 

VOL. II. K K 



258 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

was proposed by me to Lord Grenville, because it seemed 
probable that when the treaty should for some time have 
been in operation, defects might become manifest, and fur- 
ther arrangements become desirable, which had not occurred 
to either of us ; because no plan of an article relative to 
impressments, which we could devise, was so free from 
objections as to meet with mutual approbation ; and because 
the lord-chancellor's proposed article, relative to alienism 
and other interesting objects, was of such magnitude, that I 
did not think any stipulations respecting them should be 
ventured, until after that article had received the most 
mature consideration of our government. 

I think that in endeavouring to obtain a new modification 
of the 12th article, an extension of tonnage, from 70 to 100 
tons, should be attempted : for although this was strenu- 
ously pressed before, yet I can see no inconvenience in 
repeating it, by way of experiment — not insisting on it as 
an ultimatum. In my opinion, it would also be expedient 
that the new article should specify the particular commodi- 
ties which our vessels shall be permitted to carry from the 
United States to the British islands, and import from the 
latter into the former. 

As to the impressment of seamen, the forming of any a ery 
satisfactory arrangement on that head will, I fear, continue 
to prove an arduous task. In my opinion, Great Britain, 
should at present agree not to take any seamen from our 
vessels on the ocean, or in her colonial ports, on account of 
the injuries thence resulting to our navigation. It would be 
difficult to support the position, that she ought to agree not 
to seek for and take her own seamen, on board of any 
merchant vessel in the ports of Great Britain or Ireland. 

In the India, or 13th article, " It is expressly agreed, that 
the vessels of the United States shall not carry any of the 
articles, exported by them from the said British territories, 
to any port or place, except to some port or place in Amer- 
ica, where the same shall be unladen." I would propose, 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 259 

that after the word America, be added, or to some foreign 
port or -place in Asia. There is, indeed, nothing in the 
article as it now stands, which restrains the India Compa- 
ny's government from continuing to permit our vessels to 
carry cargoes from India to China; but it would be better, 
if possible, to establish this as a right by express agreement. 

For my own part, 1 regard the present moment as unfa- 
vourable for negotiations with Great Britain. Although 
she has reason not only to approve, but to admire the con- 
duct of our government, yet while it appears doubtful to 
her, whether the sentiments and dispositions of the great 
body of our people are pacific and friendly, or otherwise, it 
seems natural to suppose that it will be her policy to be 
reserved. To multiply engagements with, and facilities to 
us under such circumstances, might be ascribed to her ap- 
prehensions ; and as her government will doubtless perceive 
this risk, I suspect they will be strongly inclined to avoid it. 

Besides, I should doubt the policy of introducing into the 
negotiation atpnscnt, either so many or such propositions 
as may defer the ultimate ratification so late, as to prevent 
orders to evacuate the posts by the 1st of June next, from 
being sent in due season. 

The commercial part of the treaty may be terminated at 
the expiration of two years after the war ; and in the mean 
time, a state of things more auspicious to negotiation will 
probably arrive, especially if the next session of Congress 
should not interpose new obstacles. 

I am, dear sir, 
Your faithful friend and obedient servant, 

John Jay.

been misled into intemperate proceedings, and had given 
too much countenance to factious leaders. The latter,

TO ROBERT GOODLOE HARPER, 

Member of Congress.* 

New- York, 19th January, 1796. 

Sir, 

A friend of mine lately sent me your address to your 
constituents relative to the treaty. I have read it with 
pleasure. Had all the publications on that subject been 
written with equal knowledge and attention, or with equal 
candour and decorum, more truth would have been dis- 
seminated, and less irritation excited. 

I observe in it the following paragraph, viz. " Objections 
both personal and constitutional have been made to Mr. 
Jay. He has been said to be prepossessed in favour of 
Britain, and an avowed enemy to France. If this had been 
true, it would have been a sufficient reason for rejecting 
him — but it is not true. I can contradict it, and do, on my 
own knowledge. I heard Mr. Jay express, in public and 
private, and those who have been much more and much 
longer acquainted with him, assure me that he always has

262 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

expressed the utmost pleasure in the French revolution, and 
the warmest wishes for its success ; the greatest dislike for 
the former government, and sentiments of the highest esteem 
and respect for the nation." 

I am much obliged to you, sir, for this vindication ; but 
it being summary and in general terms, and comprehending 
only one of the points, I think it best, in order to obviate all 
further questions, to state particularly my sentiments rela- 
tive to them both. 

It has, for obvious reasons, been judged convenient to 
represent me as being strongly attached to the interests of 
Britain, and as being equally hostile to those of France. 
Before I take notice of either, I will premise, that as it is 
my duty, so it is my inclination and resolution, never to be 
a partisan of any foreign court or nation, but to be and 
remain with those independent and genuine Americans, who 
think it unwise and improper to meddle in foreign politics, 
and who regard all foreign interference in our counsels as 
derogatory to the honour, and dangerous to the best inter- 
ests of the United States. 

Not being of British descent, I cannot be influenced by 
that delicacy towards their national character, nor that par- 
tiality for it, which might otherwise be supposed not to be 
unnatural. I nevertheless continue to concur in, and to 
express those sentiments of esteem for that nation, which 
are expressed, and I believe with great sincerity, in the 
early journals of Congress. 

It is not from the characters of this or that administration, 
or prevailing party in the government, that the character 
of a nation is to be inferred. A true judgment of it can 
no otherwise be formed, than by observing the general 
tenor of their dispositions and conduct, viewed under all 
their circumstances and in all their relations, during a 
long course of time. It certainly is chiefly owing to 
institutions, laws, and principles of policy and government, 
originally derived to us as British colonists, that, with the 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 263 

favour of Heaven, the people of this country are what 
they are. 

Notwithstanding the tendency which all arbitrary gov- 
ernments, and particularly the long reign of such a monarch 
as Lewis the Fifteenth, have to debase and corrupt their 
subjects, the people of France continued to be highly dis- 
tinguished by their talents, and by their progress in the arts 
both of peace and of war. 

It is true that 1 returned from that country to this, with 
opinions unfavourable to their court; but not only without 
a wish unfriendly to them, but. on the contrary, with senti- 
ments of good-will and regard. That I have from early 
life expressed a strong dislike to the former arbitrary gov- 
ernment of France, is well known. The more I became 
acquainted with it, the more it appeared to me to be a gov- 
ernment always dreadful in theory, and always more or 
less so in practice, according to the characters of those by 
whom its powers were exercised. 

In the revolution which put a period to it, I did cordially 
rejoice : I mean the one which limited the powder of the king, 
and restored liberty to the people. The patriotic Assembly 
which concerted and accomplished that revolution, and the 
people and army who concurred in and supported it, did 
themselves immortal honour ; and impressed me (although 
my judgment did not accord with all their acts) with great 
respect and esteem for them, and with the w 7 armest wishes 
for the ultimate success and perfection of the constitution 
and government which they established. 

The successors of that memorable Assembly produced 
another revolution. They abolished the constitution and 
government which had been just established, and brought 
the king to the scaffold. 

This revolution did not give me pleasure. I derived no 
satisfaction from the disastrous fate of a prince, who (from 
whatever motives) had- done us essential services, and to 
whom we had frequently presented the strongest assur- 



264 LIFE OP JOHN JAY. 

anccs of our attachment and affection. This revolution 
had, in my eye, more the appearance of a wo than a bless- 
ing. It has caused torrents of blood and of tears, and been 
marked in its progress by atrocities very injurious to the 
cause of liberty, and offensive to morality and humanity. 

But this revolution having abolished the monarchy, de- 
clared France a republic, and received the general concur- 
rence of the nation, a new constitution became indispensable: 
and as, in case this revolution should be overthrown by the 
combined powers, they would doubtless dictate what that 
new constitution should be (an interference not to be sub- 
mitted to), I wished success to the revolution, so far as it 
had for its object not the disorganizing and managing of 
other states, which ought neither to be attempted nor per- 
mitted, but the exclusive ordering of all internal affairs, and 
the establishment of any constitution which the nation should 
prefer. It gives me pleasure to find that one has lately 
been so established ; and I sincerely wish it may be the 
means of giving permanent peace, liberty, and good gov- 
ernment to France. 

As to the issue of the war, I am far from desiring that 
either France, Britain, or Germany, or any other power, 
should acquire a decided preponderance in Europe. In my 
opinion, it would conduce more to the welfare and peace 
of those nations, and also of the United States, that they 
should remain in capacity to limit and repress the ambition 
of each other. 

I will conclude this letter with an extract from one which 
I wrote to the late secretary of state, dated at London, on 
21st November, 1794, viz: — 

" I daily become more and more convinced of the general 
friendly disposition of this country towards ours ; let us 
cherish it Let us cultivate friendship with all na- 
tions. By treating them all with justice and kindness, and 
by preserving that self-respect which forbids our yielding

to the influence or policy of any of them, we shall, with the 
Divine blessing, secure peace, union, and respectability." 

With sentiments of esteem and regard, 

I have the honour to be, sir, 
Your most obedient and humble servant,

New-York, 29th Feb., 1796. 
Dear Sir, 

I have been favoured with yours of the 15th inst. by 
M r. Parkman ; am much pleased with him and his fellow- 
traveller, Mr. Cooledge. Their representation of the state 
of things in Massachusetts corresponds with the hints on that 
head suggested in your letter. There is too much intelli- 
gence in the northern states, to admit of their being greatly 
and long deceived and misled ; and I hope the same remark 
will in time become equally applicable to all the others. 
Considering the nature of our governments, a succession of 
demagogues must be expected : and the strenuous efforts 
of the wise and virtuous will not cease to be necessary to 
frustrate their artifices and designs. They will always be 
hostile to merit, because merit will always stand in their 
way ; and being actuated by envy, ambition, or avarice, 
and not unfrequently by them all, will be diligently at 
work, while better men will take their rest. 

It seems strange, but so it is in all republics, that many 
excellent men who are happy in their families and fortunes, 
and in the esteem of society and of their friends ; who en- 
joy their villas and their gardens, and neglect not to guard 
their trees and vines from caterpillars, and their favourite 
plants and flowers from nipping frosts ; yet omit attending 
to the political grubs, who are constantly and insidiously 
labouring to wound and prey upon the roots of all their

temporal enjoyments. Several gentlemen of this descrip- 
tion with us becoming alarmed, have been very useful ; 
and I presume this has been, more or less, the case in other 
States, 
Be assured of the esteem and regard with which I am, 

Yours, &c.

New- York, 14th Feb., 1796. 
Dear Sir, 

I am much obliged to you for the books you have been so 
kind as to send me, and which, with your friendly letter of 
the 11th inst., were delivered to me yesterday. Except 
while at church, I have employed this day in reading 
the first, and part of the second volume ; and expect to 
finish the perusal of the remainder next Sunday. I have 
long been of opinion, that the evidence of the truth of 
Christianity, requires only to be carefully examined to pro- 
duce conviction in candid minds ; and I think they who 
undertake that task, will derive advantages from your 
enumeration of many interesting facts ; your remarks on 
various heads and topics ; and from your references to the 
numerous authors proper to be consulted, and some of 
whom are but little known. 

As to " The Age of Reason," it never appeared to me to 
have been written from a disinterested love of truth, or 
of mankind : nor am I persuaded, that either of those mo- 
tives induced certain characters to take such singular pains 
to distribute and give it reputation and currency in this 
country. Religion, morality, and a virtuous and enlight- 
ened clergy, will always be impediments to the progress 
and success of certain systems and designs ; and therefore 
n ill not cease to experience both direct and indirect hos- 
tilities from those who meditate or embark in them,

Philadelphia, 31st March, 1796. 

Accept, my dear sir, my thanks for your note of the 25th 
hist., enclosing a copy of 3Ir. Bayard's letter to you. The 
purport of it is pleasing ; but the conduct of the British 
armed vessels in the West Indies is intolerable beyond all 
forbearance. 

My answer, given yesterday to the House of Represen- 
tatives' request for papers, will, I expect, set a host of scrib- 
blers to work: but I shall proceed steadily on in all the 
measures which depend on the executive, to carry the 
British treaty into effect. 

This reminds me of the name of , who some 

time ago you mentioned as a commissioner; but upon 
inquiring of his countrymen, it was found he was unfit

Cleaveland-row, March 17th, 1796. 

Dear Sir, 

I cannot let Mr. Listen go, without taking the occasion 
of his departure to recommend him to you, and to express 
my hope that his character and conduct will be found well 
calculated to continue and promote that harmony, which it 
was the object of our labours to establish. I have, since 
you left us, taken one occasion to renew to you my assur- 
ances of the sincere esteem and friendship with which your 
whole conduct has impressed me, and of the high sense 
which I entertain of your virtues and talents. It is a great 
satisfaction to one, when, in the course of so many unpleasant 



268 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

discussions as a public man must necessarily be engaged 
in, he is able to look back upon any of them with as much 
pleasure, as I derived from that which procured me the 
advantage of friendship and intercourse with a man valu- 
able on every account. You, I trust, saw enough of me to 
know that these expressions are not, on my part, compli- 
ments of course, but that they proceed from sentiments of 
real esteem and regard. 

I need not tell you with how much pleasure, on every 
account, I have learned that the public in the United States 
are recovering from the delusion into which they had been 
led, and that justice is now done by the country at large, as 
it was before by well informed and well principled men, to 
the uprightness and ability of your conduct. I, on my part, 
should have thought, that I very ill consulted the interests 
of my own country, if I had been desirous of terminating 
the points in discussion between us, on any other footing 
than that of mutual justice and reciprocal advantage ; nor 
do I conceive that any just objection can be stated to the 
great work which we jointly accomplished, except on the 
part of those who believe the interest of Great Britain and 
the United States to be in contradiction with each other, 
or who wish to make them so. 

It would be a great gratification to me to learn occasion- 
ally that you are well, and that you retain a friendly recol- 
lection of one who is, with the greatest sincerity, 
Most truly and faithfully, 

Your obedient humble servant, 

Grenville. 

to loud grenville. 

New-York, 1st May, 1796. 
My Lord, 
The great questions which have agitated this country 
since my arrival, may now, I think, be considered as deter- 
mined. I will therefore no longer postpone thanking your 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 269 

lordship for the letter which you did me the honour to 
write on the 11th May last, respecting which I shall omit 
saying any thing further by this opportunity. 

The treaty will go into operation, and be supported by a 
great majority of the people; a majority comprising the 
greater part of the men most distinguished by talents, 
worth, and weight. Strenuous endeavours were made and 
persisted in, to mislead the people by all the various means 
which art, unrestrained by principle, very readily devises. 
The English and Irish emigrants joined the opposition ; and 
what seems more singular is, that the French republicans 
and French refugees, so far forgot their animosities as to 
concur in resisting the restoration of good-will between 
Great Britain and the United States. 

Anxious that the present current of public opinion in 
favour of a paciiic and conciliatory system, may not be 
checked by fresh obstacles, permit me, my lord, to submit 
to your consideration the prudence, as well as justice of 
strong measures, to prevent, as far as possible, those very 
exceptionable impressments, and other severities, which too 
often occur. They may give occasion, and I am persuaded 
will continue to give occasion to more clamour than facts 
will justify ; but it is certainly true that much just cause for 
complaint does exist, and that there are persons here who 
would rejoice if there was much more. There is reason to 
believe, that certain individuals in the British service have 
been irritated, by the improper things said and published in 
this country, to indiscreet acts of resentment ; not consider- 
ing, and probably not suspecting, that they were said and 
published for the purpose of provocation. It is to be wished, 
that they had recollected that these things were not said 
and published by our government, nor by those who desire 
to promote, and who do promote peace and harmony with 
Great Britain ; nor by those who are actuated by zeal for 
the honour and interest of their own country. 

We have aimed at, and laboured for the restoration of 



270 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

mutual justice and mutual good-will between our countries. 
The greatest difficulties are surmounted, and perseverance, 
with prudence and temper on both sides, will ensure suc- 
cess. Would not orders to discharge all impressed Amer- 
icans, and enjoining a just and friendly conduct towards the 
people of this country, cherish their confidence, and manifest 
that disposition to conciliation, which repeated instances of 
violence and severity enable designing men (and with great 
appearance of reason) to draw into question ? Would not 
friendly assurances on these points to our government, tend 
greatly to impress the public with still more favourable 
opinions of the propriety and policy of their measures ; and 
consequently diminish the credit and influence of those who 
seize every occasion of impeaching their wisdom and your 
sincerity ? These men have, indeed, for the present missed 
their object, but they have not abandoned their designs. I 
mean the leaders, not the rank and file of the party. Among 
the latter are many misled, honest men, who, as they be- 
come undeceived, will act with propriety. 

Pardon, my lord, the liberty I take in these observations. 
I write freely because I confide fully in your candour, and 
because I flatter myself that you confide in mine. I have 
not leisure, at this moment, to be more particular. This 
letter will soon be followed by others. 

With great and sincere esteem and regard, I have the 
honour to be, my lord, 

Your lordship's most obedient 

And humble servant, 

John Jay. 

to the rev. br. thatcher, boston. 

New-York, 26th May, 1796. 

Dear Sir, 

Mr. Thomas Hancock delivered to me yesterday your 
obliging letter of the 23d of last month. I shall always be 
happy in opportunities of manifesting to the family of the 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 271 

late Governor Hancock, my respect for his memory. We 
were fellow-labourers in the American revolution, and I 
reflect with pleasure on the good understanding which sub- 
sisted between us, and the friendly attentions with which 
he uniformly honoured me. Permit me to add, that my 
esteem and regard for you would not only ensure a welcome 
reception to this amiable young gentleman, but to any others 
you may recommend. 

The approbation of one judicious and virtuous man, rela- 
tive to the conduct of the negotiations in which I was 
lately engaged, affords me more satisfaction, than all the 
clamours raised on that subject by intrigue and passion 
have given me concern. It was foreseen that a strenuous 
opposition would be excited ; and I was disappointed only 
in this, that the management of it has been less circumspect 
and politic than I had supposed. There was little reason 
to expect that any treaty of amity with Great Britain, 
which our constituted L r *>vernment could form, would be 
acceptable to those anti-federalists, whose prejudices, instead 
of being removed, but gathered strength and malignity 
from the failure of their predictions ; to debtors, anxious 
by any means to elude payment, or to partisans of a 
foreign power, which had systematically and industriously 
laboured to keep us in the condition of a satellite, and pre- 
vent our ever diverging from the sphere of her attraction 
and governing influence. 

Believing the people of this country too intelligent to be 
long deceived, and not sufficiently vicious to require great 
national calamities, I hope and trust that Providence will 
continue to bless us with as much prosperity as will be 
good for us ; I say as will be good for us, for in my opinion 
Agur's prayer is not less suitable for nations than for 
individuals. With the best wishes for your health and 
happiness, I am, dear sir, 

Your most obedient and humble servant, 

John Jay. 



272 WFE OF JOHN JAY. 



TO WILLIAM VAUGHAX. 

New-York, 26th May, 1796. 

Dear Sir, 

The letters of the 24th and 28th November last, with 
which you favoured me, have remained long unanswered, 
though not forgotten ; my time having, since my arrival, 
been so occupied by public concerns, that I have had no 
leisure to attend to my private affairs or correspondence. 

As to political reformations in Europe or elsewhere, I con- 
fess that, considering men as being what they are, I do not 
amuse myself with dreams about an age of reason, prior to 
the millennium, which I believe will come, though I cannot 
tell the precise time when. Until that period arrives, I 
expect there will be wars, and commotions, and tyrants, 
and factions, and demagogues, and that they will do mis- 
chief as they may have opportunity. Human knowledge 
and experience will doubtless continue to do good, in pro- 
portion to their extent and influence ; but that they will 
ever be able to reduce the passions and prejudices of man- 
kind to such a state of subordination to right reason as 
modern philosophers would persuade us, I do not believe 
one word of. 

I should not think that man wise, who should employ his 
time in endeavouring to contrive a shoe that would fit every 
foot ; and they do not appear to me much more wise, who 
expect to devise a government that would suit every nation. 
I have no objections to men's mending or changing their 
own shoes, but I object to their insisting on my mending or 
changing mine. I am content that little men should be as 
free as big ones, and have and enjoy the same rights ; but 
nothing strikes me as more absurd than projects to stretch 
little men into big ones, or shrink big men into little ones. 
Liberty and reformation may run mad, and madness of any 
kind is no blessing. I nevertheless think, that there may 
be a time for reformation, and a time for change, as well as 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 273 

for other things ; all that I contend for is, that they be done 
soberly, by sober and discreet men, and in due manner, 
measure, and proportion. It may be said, that this cannot 
always be the case. It is true, and we can only regret it. 
We must take men and things as they are, and act accord- 
ingly ; that is, circumspectly. 

With the best wishes for your health and happiness, 
I am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, 

John Jay. 

to george hammond,* england. 

New-York, 15th June, 1796. 
Dear Sir, 

Accept my thanks for your friendly letter of the 14th 
March last. I am happy in resuming my correspondence 
with my friends in England, and regret that it has been so 
long suspended. As Mr. King will be the bearer of this 
letter, I refer you to him for information respecting the 
state of affairs here. You have heard of the appointment of 
this gentleman to succeed Mr. Pinckney. You are well 
acquainted with his qualifications for that place, and with his 
character, public and private. 

I thank you for making to Lord Grenville the intimation 
I requested relative to the intended present. I shall deem 
myself sufficiently honoured and gratified, if my endeavours 
should prove conducive to permanent peace and concilia- 
tion between our countries. This can, and I hope will, be 
accomplished. Nature has made few difficulties within 
the sphere of honest and rational policy, that are insupera- 
ble to prudence and perseverance. Mutual justice, mutual 
kindness, and a little mutual forbearance will ensure suc- 
cess. But it is to be remembered, that political, like other 
fields, require constant attention ; when neglected, they 
soon become unproductive, and fresh weeds, briers, and 
thorns will gradually spring up.

274 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

The tide in human affairs, of which the poet speaks, now 
runs favourably, and will present a proper occasion for 
arranging our West India commerce. The war has, in a 
great degree, suspended the importance of it to us. When 
that suspension ceases, a strong sense of it will return, and 
will excite uneasiness which should be obviated or allayed by 
regulations as satisfactory as can well be made. Although 
a system more liberal than that in the twelfth article, if it 
had been immediately made, might have been ascribed to 
the pressure of circumstances, rather than to motives more 
pleasing and friendly : yet that objection has nearly lost its 
force, and passed its time ; for the treaty is now in opera- 
tion, with the approbation of a decided and great majority 
of the people, and success attends your arms. 

While America has no just cause of complaint against 
Britain, nor Britain against America, their commercial and 
friendly relations will operate freely and effectually, and the 
designs of those who aim at discord between them will 
prove abortive. 

I am, dear sir, 

Yours very sincerely, 

John Jay. 

from lord grenville. 

Dropmore, July 9th, 179fi. 

My dear Sir, 

It is a great satisfaction to me to have to acknowledge 
two of your letters, and to be allowed the hope of hearing 
from you more frequently. I should have been very sorry 
to think that I w T as wholly out of your recollection, as I fre- 
quently reflect with pleasure on the opportunity I had of 
becoming acquainted with a character which I saw so much 
reason to esteem. 

Mr. Gore delivered to me, a few days ago, your letter of 
introduction. He seems to be a sensible and moderate 
man, and I shall have great pleasure both in facilitating, as 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 275 

far as may depend on me, the public objects of his mission, 
and in showing him any private attention and civility 
that maybe in my power. I think he and his colleague 
will be well satisfied with the choice which has been made 
here for that commission. Both Dr. Xieoll and Mr. Ansty 
are known (in some degree) in America, the former by 
character, the latter personally; and I trust the appoint- 
ment has proved the spirit in which it was made. If I do 
not deceive myself, the choice of the commissioners who 
are going to America will not be less satisfactory. Their 
names are not yet announced, but I look upon the appoint- 
ment as very nearly, if not quite, fixed. 

Your letter of the 1st of May was delivered to me two 
days ago, and I take the opportunity of this mail to answer 
it. I have the greatest pleasure in hearing from you, that 
you consider the questions which have agitated America 
since your arrival as determined. I think we always felt 
that even after the great points were adjusted, and a founda- 
tion of solid friendship laid, something must be still left for 
the operation of time and temper. Where so much heat 
has prevailed, irritation will remain among individuals, and 
will occasionally produce inconvenience and embarrassment 
to both governments. Mutual good disposition and confi- 
dence, a uniform and steady conduct in great points, and 
moderation respecting those of less importance, must ulti- 
mately surmount these difficulties, as they have already 
surmounted others which were much greater. 

With respect to the impressments, I am confident that 
such orders as you speak of have been more than once 
repeated. I speak from general impression, not having had 
opportunity to ascertain the fact since I received your 
letter. But I think I can answer for it that they shall be 
renewed. In this country, much of the detail of that busi- 
ness has fallen within my own knowledge ; and I can say 
positively, that I do not think one instance can be brought 
where a seaman has not been discharged, who could pro- 



276 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

duce, I do not say proof, but any probable, or even plausi- 
ble ground for supposing him a native citizen of the United 
States, or a resident there at the time of the separation from 
this country. In some instances, the conduct observed has 
been so favourable, that within the last week, before I 
received your letter, two men were discharged, one on pro- 
ducing a certificate of an American consul here, which did 
not recite on what grounds or from what proof it was 
given, but merely asserted the fact that the bearer was an 
American citizen ; and the other, on producing a paper 
neither certified nor attested, but purporting to be a dis- 
charge from an American regiment of militia, — a paper 
which, even if genuine, may, as you will easily see, have 
passed into twenty hands before it was produced here. 

I saw in the proceedings of the last session of the Con- 
gress, some steps taken towards a regular establishment 
for the granting certificates. If such an establishment were 
formed, with proper and sufficient checks to prevent its 
being abused, the effect would be to do away the greatest 
part of our difficulties on the subject. But I much fear that 
the ideas prevalent in America on the subject of emigra- 
tion, will prevent this ever being well or satisfactorily done. 

I have been led into this discussion by what you say of 
the advantage which might arise from giving orders, which 
I am confident have been repeatedly given. The assu- 
rances of Mr. Liston on the subject will also, I trust, be 
such as you seem to desire. 

I beg you to believe that you cannot do a thing more 
agreeable to me, or, perhaps, more useful to the interest 
of both our countries, than in expressing to me at all times, 
freely and without reserve, your opinion as to the means 
of maintaining that spirit which we jointly laboured to estab- 
lish. This may be a means of rendering our correspond- 
ence greatly and permanently beneficial. Agreeable to 
me it can never fail to be, while it conveys to me informa- 
tion of your welfare, and gives me the opportunity of 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 277 

assuring you of the very sincere esteem and regard with 
which 

I have the honour to be, my dear sir, 

Your most faithful and obedient humble servant, 

Grenville. 

to col. trumbull,* london. 

New-York, 20th Oct., 1796. 
Dear Sir, 

It gave me pleasure to receive from Dr. Edwards your 
letter of the 7th ult., and to converse with him on the sub- 
jects alluded to in it. My letters to you and others on 
your side of the water have, since my return, been few, 
and not very interesting. The risks to which letters are 
exposed in times like these, rendered me more reserved 
than I should otherwise have been. 

You have doubtless by this time heard that Mr. Benson 
has been chosen the third commissioner for ascertaining 
the river St. Croix, intended by the treaty of peace. He 
is now on that business ; a better appointment could not 
have been made. Whatever the decision may be, both 
parties will, I am persuaded, have reason to be satisfied 
with it. 

You are now placed, as you well observe, in a situation 
delicate and important. Your reflections on it are just and 
proper. The interest I take in what concerns you induces 
me to enlarge a little upon them. 

To settle and agree on the principles which ought to 
govern in the capture cases, as well as the application of 
them to those cases, will require great care, consideration, 
and impartiality. The majority of the commissioners 
being Americans, the honour of our country will be in- 
creased or diminished by their decisions. I flatter myself 

* One of the American commissioners under the British treaty. 



278 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

they will be such as to merit the approbation of distant and 
disinterested generations in both countries. 

It is natural that the claimants should, and they doubtless 
-will be, sanguine in their expectations. Some of them 
may be difficult to satisfy, and perhaps become clamorous. 
Firmness, therefore, as well as integrity and caution, will 
be requisite to explore and persevere in the path of justice. 
They who, in following her footsteps, tread upon popular 
prejudices, or crush the schemes of individuals, must ex- 
pect clamours and resentment. The best way to prevent 
being perplexed by considerations of that kind is to dismiss 
them all, and never to permit the mind to dwell upon them 
for a moment. I suspect it is with men in these cases, as it 
is said to be with women in certain others, they who hesitate 
are in danger of being lost. 

Although a judge may possess the best talents, and the 
purest intentions, yet let him keep a jealous eye over his 
sensibilities and attachments, lest they imperceptibly give 
to error too near a resemblance to truth. Nay, let him 
even watch over that jealousy, for the apprehension of 
being thought partial to one side, has a tendency to incline 
a delicate mind towards the other. 

I am, dear sir, 

Very sincerely your friend, 

John Jay.

Albany, 28th Feb., 1797. 
Dear Sir, 
I have been favoured with yours of the 14th ult. and 
also with the one which accompanied the set of your 
Geography, for which be pleased to accept my thanks. 

It gives me pleasure to learn, that you will endeavour at 
least to prepare for a history of the American revolution. 
To obtain competent and exact information on the subject 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 279 

is not the least arduous part of the task ; it will require 
much time, patient perseverance, and research. As the 
revolution was accomplished by the councils and efforts of 
the Union, and by the auxiliary councils and efforts of 
each individual State or colony, it appears to me that your 
inquiries will necessarily be divided into those two depart- 
ments; the first of thorn will of course include foreign 
affairs, and both of them will naturally divide into two 
others; viz. the civil and the military. Each of these, 
you know, comprehends several distinct heads, which are 
obvious. 

So much of our colonial history as casts light on the 
revolution, viewed under its different aspects, and con- 
sidered in all its anterior relations, will be essential. I 
think our colonial history is strongly marked by discrim- 
inating circumstances relative to our political situation and 
feelings, at three different periods : 1st, down to the revo- 
lution under King William ; 2d, from thence to the year 
1763 ; and 3d, from that year to the union of the colonies 
in 1774. Want of leisure will not permit me to go into 
details. 

As to documents — public and private journals of Con- 
gress — the papers mentioned or alluded to in them, such 
as certain reports of committees ; letters to and from civil 
and military officers, ministers, agents, state-governors, &c; 
the proceedings of the standing committees for marine, 
commercial, fiscal, political, and foreign affairs — all merit 
attention. 

The journals and papers of State conventions, and coun- 
cils of safety, and of some of the standing and other com- 
mittees, during the revolutionary government, contain much 
interesting information. 

There are also diaries and memoirs, and private letters, 
which would give some aid and light to a sagacious and 
cautious inquirer ; for experience has convinced me, that

they derive from the well-established characters of the 
writers for judgment, accuracy, and candour. As to char- 
acters, I have, throughout the revolution, known some who 
passed for more than they were worth, and others who 
passed for less. On this head, great circumspection is par- 
ticularly requisite. It is to be regretted, but so I believe 
the fact to be, that except the Bible, there is not a true his- 
tory in the world. Whatever may be the virtue, discern- 
ment, and industry of the writers, I am persuaded, that 
truth and error (though in different degrees) will imper- 
ceptibly become and remain mixed and blended, until they 
shall be separated for ever by the great and last refining 
fire. 

I remain, my dear sir, 

Your very obedient servant,

to doctor rush. 

Albany, 22d March, 1797. 

Dear Sir, 

I have received and read with pleasure your elegant 
eulogium on the late Mr. Rittenhouse. Such attentions to 
worthy characters, cherish and encourage modest merit. 
As a man and a philosopher, his title to esteem and praise 
is, I believe, universally acknowledged. 

The "Illustrations of the Prophecies" which you mention, 
I have not seen. On my return to New- York I will inquire 
for it. The author's applying certain of the prophecies to 
certain recent events, renders his work the more interesting. 
I have frequently known this to be done with more imagi- 
nation than judgment, but from your account of the book, 
I presume it is not liable to that remark. The subject 
naturally excites attention, and the present extraordinary 
state of things permits an idea to slide into the mind, that 
even additional events, admitting of a like application, may 
precede a general peace.

We live, my dear sir, in times that furnish abundant 
matter for serious and profound reflections. It is a conso- 
latory (me, thai every scourge of every kind by which

With sincere esteem and regard, 1 am, dear sir,

to lord grenville. 

New-York, 4th June, 1797. 
My Lord, 

A long interval has passed between the date of my last 
letter and that of this. They would have been more 
frequent, had they been exposed to less risk of inter- 
ception. 

My respect and esteem for your lordship remain unabated, 
and I yet flatter myself with the pleasure of becoming a 
better correspondent. It will give you satisfaction to know 
that the letters I have received from Mr. King and Mr. 
Gore, make honourable mention of the candour and good 
faith of your government. They both appear to be well 
pleased, and I am glad of it. The proceedings of the 
Congress now in session will doubtless be sent to you. 
There appears to be a general disposition to pacific mea- 
sures throughout our country. If it procures peace, so 
much the better ; if not, we shall be the more united. To 
put our adversaries in the wrong is always a valuable point 
gained, especially as the forbearance necessary for the pur- 
pose will not in the present instance be prompted by fear, 
nor produce dejection. 

In every event, some malcontents are to be expected ; 
and it is remarkable that patriots born in British dominions, 
are very distinguishable among those who the most invari- 
ably oppose our government and its measures. They 
appear to be as little disposed to promote good-will between

our two countries, as the French ; indeed, they seem to like 

our government as little as they did their own. 

I have the honour to be, with very great respect, esteem, 

and regard, 

My lord, 

Your lordship's most obedient servant, 

John Jay. 



TO BENJAMIN VAUGHAN. 

New- York, 31st Aug., 1797. 

Dear Sir, 

I had this afternoon the pleasure of receiving your favour 
of the 18th inst. Mrs. Jay joins me in sincerely congratu- 
lating you and your amiable family on your arrival in this 
country ; may your expectations of happiness in it be fully 
realized. 

The reasons which have determined you to settle on the 
Kennebeck, I can easily conceive are cogent, but I natter 
myself you will sometimes find leisure for excursions this 
way. 

I presume that our political sentiments do not differ 
essentially. To me it appears important that the American 
government be preserved as it is, until mature experience 
shall very plainly point out very useful amendments to our 
constitution ; that we steadily repel all foreign influence and 
interference, and with good faith and liberality treat all 
nations as friends in peace, and as enemies in war ; neither 
meddling with their affairs, nor permitting them to meddle 
with ours. These are the primary objects of my policy. 
The secondary ones are more numerous, such as, to be 
always prepared for war, to cultivate peace, to promote 
religion, industry, tranquillity, and useful knowledge, and to 
secure to all the quiet enjoyment of their rights, by wise 
and equal laws irresistibly executed. I do not expect that 
mankind will, before the millennium, be what they ought to 
be ; and therefore, in my opinion, every political theory 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 283 

which does not regard them as being what they arc, will 
probably prove delusive. 

It will give me pleasure to receive the publication you 
mention; being from your pen, it will, I am persuaded, be 
interesting. Be pleased to present our best compliments 
to Mrs. Vaughan and your sister. 

I am, dear sir, 
Your affectionate and humble servant, 

John Jay. 

to col. john trumbull, london. 

Albany, 27th October, 1797. 
Dear Sir, 

I received, three days ago, by the post, your letter of the 
7th of August, in which was a copy of the one you had 
written on the 20th of July, and the original of which I had 
received and read with pleasure. 

The difficulty and delicacy of your task, my good friend, 
are obvious; but I natter myself the reputation to be derived 
from it will soften the trouble and anxiety it gives you. It 
was not to be expected that the judgments of the commis- 
sioners would not frequently differ, for the best judges 
sometimes vary in opinion from each other ; but it is to be 
expected, as well as wished, that their decisions may bear 
the test of the severe examination which they will certainly 
at one time or other undergo. 

The delays of the court of admiralty do not surprise me. 
I have no faith in any British court of admiralty, though I 
have the greatest respect for, and the highest confidence in 
their courts of justice, in the number of which, those courts 
do not deserve to be ranked. I do not extend this stricture 
to the lords of appeal. 

The question you hint at is interesting. Perhaps a mode 
might be devised for making and receiving claims de bene 
esse; but if any thing of that kind should be done, it should 
be on more mature consideration than that on which I 



284 LIFE OP JOHN JAY. 

suggest it ; it is a thought which just occurred to me, and 
which I have not examined. 

I am settled here with my family, at least for the winter. 
The Legislature have determined that this city shall be the 
seat of government, and that the principal public offices 
shall be here. 

As to politics, we are in a better state than we were : 
but we are not yet in a sound state. I think that nation is 
not in a sound state whose parties are excited by objects 
interesting only to a foreign power. I wish to see our 
people more Americanized, if I may use that expression; 
until we feel and act as an independent nation, we shall 
always suffer from foreign intrigue. 

Whether peace in Europe would ensure peace to America, 
is a question on which doubts are entertained. In my opinion, 
it will depend on circumstances, and not on any right or 
wrong about the matter. 

Remember me to our friends, Mr. King, and Mr. Gore. 
I owe letters to them, and to others, but the fate of letters 
has been so precarious, that I have written much fewer 
than I should otherwise have done. 

I am, dear sir, yours sincerely, 

John Jav. 

to timothy pickering. 

Secretary of State. 

Albany, 13th November, 1797. 
Dear Sir, 
I consider myself much obliged by your friendly and 
interesting letter of the 28th ult. From Talleyrand's ex- 
pressions and conduct it seems, and I infer, that, he will act 
as favourably towards us as may consist with his personal 
views, for I have very little confidence in his being governed 
by any moral principles, further than they may be con- 
veniently adopted. As to Otto and La Forest, I entertain 
of them in that respect very similar sentiments ; they 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 285 

will probably be inclined towards us as far as may suit 
them. 

The recent explosion at Paris has cast mosl of our cal- 
culations and conjectures, relative to the issue of our nego- 
tiations with the Directory, very much into the air. A 
complete state of defence at home, appears to me to be the 
only solid foundation on which to rest our hopes of security, 
and I regret that more has not been done towards it. But 
until our people become more united, and feel more sensibly 
the pride and the duties of independence, our Jacobins will 
not cease to perplex the measures of our government, 
however wise and salutary. It is pleasing to observe, that 
notwithstanding their efforts to mislead, the public mind is 
gradually recovering from its errors, and to this end your 
public reports and letters have essentially contributed. 
Your answer to the Spanish minister's factious and indecent 
letter, has made stronger impressions than he and his coun- 
sellors probably suspect. 

Yours, very sincerely, 

John Jay. 

to major-general alexander ha3iilton. 

Albany, 30th August, 1798. 
Dear Sir, 
I was this morning favoured with yours of the 27th inst. 
I regret the circumstances which prevented our seeing each 
other when you were here. There are several topics on 
which I wish to converse with you, and particularly 
respecting military arrangements at New-York. The rifle 
corps, and a few of the new light-infantry companies are 
established. There were reasons which I shall mention 
when we meet, which induced me to suspend a decision 
relative to the others for the present. The objections stated 
in the petition are not, in my judgment, conclusive. So 
soon as the commissions advised by the council are de- 
spatched, I propose to set out for New- York. The defence 



28G LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

of the port, &c., in my opinion, should be under your direc- 
tion. The measures will be concerted between us. The 
council will meet again before the session, and all such new 
corps as ought to be established, will then without difficulty 
be organized ultimately. I think with you on the subject 
of resignations. 

It is with me a question whether any person convicted 
of forgery ought to be pardoned at present, when offences 
of that kind abound. As yet I have not pardoned any 
convicts of that description, except in cases where the con- 
victions turned on a balance of evidence, and where guilt 
w T as probable, but not certain. Mr. Murray has just been 
with me on this subject. I shall take it into further con- 
sideration, but fear the objections will prove insuperable. 
The young man's father and family are to be pitied, but the 
power to pardon is a trust to be exercised on principles of 
sound discretion, combining policy, justice, and humanity ; 
— we will talk this matter over. I have an idea of puttkig 
the light corps into a regiment, and making our friend 
Troup colonel of it. 

I am, dear sir, 

Yours, sincerely, 

John Jay. 

to the rev. dr. morse. 

Albany, 30th January, 1799. 

Dear Sir, 

You will herewith receive copies of the acts of our two 
last sessions. A variety of official and other affairs, which, 
although in numerous instances of little importance, yet 
required to be despatched with punctuality, induced me, 
from time to time, to postpone replying to your obliging 
letter of the 19th November, and to thank you for the 
interesting pamphlets you was so kind as to send with it. 

We see many things, my dear sir, which might be altered 
for the better, and that, I believe, has been the case at all 



MISCELLANEOUS CORItESPONDEX ■ 287 

times. But at this period, there certainly are an uncom- 
mon number and series of events and circumstances, which 
assume an aspect unusually portentous. The seeds of 
trouble are sowing and germinating in our country, as well 
as in many others; they are cultivated with a zeal so 
singularly blind, as not, in many instances, to be easily 
accounted for. Infidelity has become a political engine, 
alarming both by the force and the extent of its operations. 
It is doubtless permitted to be used for wise ends, tho 
we do not clearly discern them ; when those ends shall be 
accomplished, it will be laid aside. 

Much ill use has been, and will yet be made of secret 
societies. I think with you that they should not be encour- 
aged, and that the most virtuous and innocent of them 
w r ould do well to concur in suspending them for the present. 

What precisely is to be understood of the death and 
resurrection of the witnesses, will probably be explained 
only by the event. I have an idea, that cither the ( >ld and 
Xew Testaments, or the moral and revealed law are the tw< i 
witnesses : witnesses to the existence, attributes, promises, 
and denunciations of the Supreme Being. Atheism is now 
killing these witnesses. That all true and pious apostles 
or believers are everywhere or generally to be slain, seems 
hardly credible. Whatever or whoever the witnesses may 
be, it is certain that the slaughter is not yet perfected. I 
much doubt whether, in any view of the subject, the clergy 
of the church of Rome are of the number. 

The pope has lost his triple crown, and his spiritual 
dominion is rapidly declining. The Turk is now a party 
to the war ; whether any or what consequences will result 
from it to Mahomet, is yet to be seen. Wide is the field 
open for conjectures. 

That our country is to drink very deep of the cup of 
tribulation, I am not apprehensive ; but that we shall en- 
tirely escape, does not appear to me very probable. I 
suspect that the jacobins are still more numerous, more 



288 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

desperate, and more active in this country, than is generally 
supposed. It is true, they are less indecorous and less 
clamorous than they have been. How few of their leaders 
have abandoned their errors, their associations, their oppo- 
sition to their own government, and their devotion to a 
foreign one ! Why, and by whom, were the Kentucky and 
Virginia resolutions contrived, and for what purposes ? I 
often think of Pandora's box : although it contained every 
kind of evil, yet it is said that hope was placed at the bot- 
tom. This is a singular fable, and it admits of many, and 
some of them very extensive applications. 

With very sincere esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

John Jay. 

to benjamin goodhue. 

Albany, 29th March, 1799. 

Dear Sir, 

The letters which you were so obliging as to write to me 
from Philadelphia have been received, and disposed of in 
the manner you requested. 

The information communicated in those letters has given 
me much concern. The expediency of the president's 
declaration, that he would not send another minister to 
France, until he should receive assurances, &c, was not, 
in my judgment, unquestionable. There are political con- 
siderations against it, and there are others in its favour. 
Such a declaration, however, was made, and the propriety 
of it seems to have been acquiesced in. 

It is to be wished that Mr. Murray had been more re- 
served in his conversations with the French secretary, on 
the subject of our national differences. These matters 
were foreign to his department, and I presume they were 

* Member of Congress. 



MISCELLANEOUS COnilESPOXDEXCE. 289 

not within his instructions. Those conversations have 
facilitated overtures, which are calculated, and I believe 
designed, to perplex and divide our councils, and to mislead 
public opinion. 

The manner in which Mr. Murray transmitted these 
overtures to the president, is such a deviation from the official 
and customary course, as (unless adopted for extraordinary 
and substantial reasons) is certainly exceptionable. Nor 
does any reason occur to me, why the president thought it 
proper to omit communicating the overtures to the secre- 
tary of state. Such is my confidence in the patriotism of 
the president, and also of the secretary, that every indica- 
tion of want of confidence between them appears to me 
singular, and to be regretted. 

Whether these overtures (considered in connexion with 
the before-mentioned declaration of the president, and other 
existing circumstances) should have been accepted, or en- 
couraged, or rejected, or neglected, a iv questions not free 
from doubts. I am inclined to think that immediate attention 
to them was neither necessary nor advisable, and that they 
had not as yet acquired such a degree of maturity, as to call 
for any formal, national act. But viewing this subject in all 
its various relations, I suspect it is one of those on which 
statesmen might naturally be led to opposite opinions, by 
the difficulty of estimating the precise weight and balance 
of the many and diverse considerations comprehended 
in it. 

Much might be said, but not to much purpose ; for what- 
ever remarks maybe applicable to the origin, progress, and 
present state of this perplexing affair, it is as it is. Nothing 
thorefore remains, but to make the best of the situation into 
which we are carried, and to avail ourselves of all the 
advantages to be derived from the united talents and efforts 
of the best friends to our country and government. The 
apprehensions entertained from the projected negotiation 
may not be extensively realized, and events may yet arise 

VOL. II. O O 



Of)() LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

to press the Directory into proper measures relative to this 
country— measures not to be expected from their sincerity, 
or sense of decorum or justice. 

I am for aiding and adhering to the president, and for 
promoting the best understanding between him and the 
heads of the departments. Notwithstanding what has hap- 
pened, I hope his real friends will not keep at a distance 
from him, nor withhold from him that information, which 
none but his friends will give him. Union, sedate firmness, 
and vigorous preparations for war, generally afford the best 
means of counteracting the tendencies of insidious profes- 
sions, and of too great public confidence in them. 
With great esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

John Jay. 



FROM RUFUS KING. 

London, March 18th, 1790. 
Dear Sir, 

The opposition of Virginia, and of her offspring, Ken- 
tucky, appears bolder and more considerable than I had 
apprehended. The reform that seems to have taken place 
in the Carolinas is, however, a consoling and important 
circumstance. I have been inclined to believe that the 
Congressional election was the principal object of these 
inflammatory proceedings, which discredit and injure us so 
much abroad, and when passed, that these States would 
display less turbulence. 

According to present appearances, the war must recom- 
mence between France and Austria, if it has not already 
begun ; but that an honest and solid confederacy against 
France is likely to take place between the great powers, is 
more than I dare even to expect. Russia is uncommonly 
zealous. Passawan Ouglou has accepted pardon and pro- 
motion ; and it is just now said, how accurately is another 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 29 J 

point, that Prussia and Austria arc to lay aside their mutual 
jealousy, and to consult and act together for their common 
safetv. 

The commercial condition of England is extremely pros- 
perous, and iiMtw ithstanding the hazardous and really dread- 
ful situation of Ireland, this country is united in an uncom- 
mon degree, and appears resolved to persevere in the war. 
The minister, at the opening of his budget, estimates the 
total income of all the people of ( Jreat Britain at a hundred 
million per annum ; and it is confidently expected, that the 
taxes of this year will considerably exceed one-third of this 
sum. 

The Directory lately hold a language respecting America 
more moderate, but not less artful and dangerous. Whe- 
ther any change in their privateering laws will be made, I 
think uncertain ; if my conjectures respecting the view's of 
the Directory are correct, these laws will be new modified, 
or at least for a time suspended. After the experience we 
have had, it will be humiliating if we are deceived by the 
artifices that will be practised among our people. 
I am always and sincerely, dear sir, 

Your obedient and faithful servant, 

Runs King. 

TO WILLIAM WILBERFORCE, LONDON. 

Albany, 3d September, 1799. 
Dear Sir, 

It was not until the last week, that I had the pleasure of 
receiving from Mr. Naylor your obliging and very friendly 
letter of the 24th Feb., 1798. Accept my thanks for it. 

Permit me to congratulate you on the promising aspect 
of affairs in Europe. England stands high, and while just, 
no one ought to repine at her prosperity. In my opinion, 
she does not pass for more than she is worth. \ our tax 
on income does honour to the minister who devised it, to 
the parliament who adopted it, and to the people who bear

it. If hereafter accommodated to a state of peace, it would 
be a powerful auxiliary to your sinking fund. 

Our conversation here turns so much on Great Britain 
and (as some phrase it) her doings, that I find myself insen- 
sibly led to these interesting topics. Not only Great Brit- 
ain, but every other civilized country, will have reason to 
rejoice when the present atrocious war, and the pestiferous 
principles which generated and have protracted it, shall 
cease to distress and to corrupt mankind. May that happy 
period not be distant. 

With great esteem and regard, and the best wishes for 
your health and happiness, I am, dear sir, 

Your most obedient and faithful servant,

to the rev. samuel miller. 

Albany, 28th February, 1800. 

Sir, 

Accept my thanks for the sermon on the death of Gen- 
eral Washington, which you was so obliging as to send me. 
In my opinion, it abounds in excellent sentiments, well 
arranged and expressed. Writing thus freely, I think it 
candid to observe, that in some instances ideas are con- 
veved which do not appear to me to be correct ; such, for 
instance, as " our glorious emancipation from Britain." 
The Congresses of 1771 and 1775 regarded the people of 
this country as being free ; and such was their opinion of 
the liberty we enjoyed so late as the year 1763, that they 
declared the colonies would be satisfied on being replaced 
in the political situation in which they then were. It was 
not until after the year 17 03, that Britain attempted to sub- 
ject us to arbitrary domination. We resisted the stamp act 
with energy and success ; and when afterward she claimed to 
bind us in all cases whatever, the same spirit of resistance 
animated' our councils and our conduct : when she recurred 
to arms to put a yoke upon us, we recurred to arms to keep 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 293 

it off. A struggle ensued which produced the revolution, 
and ended in an entire dissolution of all the political ties 
which had before subsisted between the two countries. 
Thus we became a distinct nation; audi think truth will 
justify our indulging the pride of saying, that we and our 
ancestors have kept our necks free from yokes, and that the 
term emancipation is not applicable to us. 

Speaking of the measures of General Washington's civil 
administration, you observe, and so is the fact, " that there 
is less unanimity among his countrymen with respect to 
these, than with respect to his military services." But, do 
facts warrant our ascribing this diminution of unanimity 
entirely to doubts respecting the wisdom of those measures? 
The revolution found and left only two primary parties, 
viz. the whigs who succeeded, and the tories who were 
suppressed. The former were unanimous in approving 
the leading measures, both civil and military, which gave 
them victory. When the adoption of the new constitution 
afterward came into question, the whigs divided into two 
parties, the one for and the other against it. The party for 
the constitution prevailed ; and they have with as great 
unanimity approved of General Washington's civil as of 
his military measures and services. The party opposed 
to the constitution disapproved of the government estab- 
lished by it ; and there are very few of the important 
measures of that government which have escaped their 
censure. 

I take the liberty of making these remarks from the re- 
spect I have for your talents ; and an opinion, that with due 
circumspection they will promote the great interests of 
truth, virtue, and national liberty. Receive them, there- 
fore, as marks of the esteem with which I am, sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

John Jay. 



294 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 



TO THE REV. DR. MORSE. 

Albany, 24th April, 1800. 

Dear Sir, 

Several affairs, more interesting to others than to me, 
have for some months past so pressed upon me, as, together 
with official business, to leave me little leisure to attend 
even to my own concerns. Hence I have been constrained 
into delays respecting my correspondents, which could not 
have been less agreeable to their feelings than to my own. 

Accept my thanks for the several communications with 
which you have favoured me. The facts which you have 
given to the public relative to the conduct of France in our 
revolution, as well as your strictures on the designs and 
intrigues of the illumines, have, to a certain extent, been 
useful. They have made proper impressions on many 
sedate and candid men, but I suspect they have detached 
very few of the disciplined adherents of the party. As 
yet, there appears but little reason to believe that philoso- 
phism is losing ground in our country. There is indeed 
less said about it, but indications of immorality are neither 
less frequent, nor more odious and disgraceful in common 
estimation than heretofore. A moral epidemic seems to 
prevail in the world. What may be its duration, or the 
limits of its ravages, time only can ascertain. 

The approaching general election in this State will be 
unusually animated. No arts or pains will be spared to 
obtain an anti-federal representation, in order to obtain an 
anti-federal president, &c. and through him divers other 
objects. 

The late revolution in France does not appear to have 
dissipated the clouds which veiled from our view the fate 
of that and other countries. As yet, I see little reason to 
expect the restoration of the Bourbon family ; nor is it 
certain that great good would result from it. Of the issue 
of the present interesting campaign, no satisfactory conjee- 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 29S 

turcs can yet be formed; and nothing at present appears 
which presents a fair prospect of a speedy termination of 
the miseries of Europe. < >ur envoys in France will prob- 
ably succeed; bul whether thai success would ultimately 
promote our tranquillity and happiness, is a point on which 
many judicious men differ in opinion. 

We have lost much in General Washington, whose death 
you and others have made the subject of eloquent dis- 
courses. From the state of our parties and affairs, some 
are persuaded that he has been taken from evil to conic It 
may be so ; but I fear that such apprehensions are some- 
times indulged too far, and that they often disqualify men 
from meeting either good or evil in a becoming manner. 
With great esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 

Your most obedient servant.

to theophiltjs parsons. 

Albany, 1st July, 1800. 

Sir, 

On my return from New- York on Friday last, your 
obliging letter of the 5th of May, which arrived here during 
my absence, was delivered to me. I am much gratified by 
the information it contains, and thank you for it. 

Serious apprehensions were entertained that anti-federal- 
ism had gained considerable ground in Massachusetts, but 
I am happy to find from the facts you state, that appear- 
ances do not warrant the conclusions which have been 
drawn from them. 

The present aspect of our affairs is far from being agree- 
able. Although peculiarly blessed, and having abundant 
reason for content and gratitude, our nation is permitting 
their happiness to be put in jeopardy by the worst passions, 
inflamed and directed by the most reprehensible means. 
Whether the good sense of the people will avert the dan- 



296 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

gers which threaten them, is yet to be seen. If the sound 
and leading friends of their country could concur in opinion 
as to men and measures, their efforts would probably be 
successful ; but unfortunately, there is too little unanimity in 
many points, and the want of it exposes us to the hazard 
of many evils. 

It really appears to me that the mission of our envoys to 
France has been treated with too much asperity. The 
president declared to the Congress that he would never 
send another legation to Paris, until he received assurances 
that it would be properly respected. As that declaration 
seemed to imply that when he should receive such assur- 
ances he would again send envoys, it was not unnatural 
that he should conceive himself bound in honour to do so. 
This attachment to the dictates of honour and good faith, 
even supposing it to have been too scrupulous, is amiable 
and praiseworthy. Whether that declaration was advisable, 
and whether the nomination of the envoys was made ex- 
actly in season, are questions which, like others of the same 
kind, may receive different answers from different men ; 
but having nominated the envoys and received the requisite 
assurances, I, for my part, consider the sending them as a 
matter of course, and I do not concur in opinion with those 
gentlemen who think they should nevertheless have been 
detained. 

I regret that my absence deprived me of the pleasure of 
seeing the Rev. Mr. Andrews, and the more so, as he 
would have answered my inquiries respecting many of my 
friends at Boston, and informed me of your health. 

With the best wishes that you may now and long enjoy 
that valuable blessing, I am, sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

John Jay. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPOADENX'E. 297 



TO silt JOHN SINCLAIR, LONDON. 

Albany, 16th De :ember, 1800. 
Si;<, 

I had yesterday the pleasure of receiving fro»i the secre- 
tary of state, the letter which you did me the honour to 
write on the 22d May last. 

They who feel an interest in the honour of this country, 
cannot fail of being gratified by every mark of respect to 
the memory of our late president. The tribute of com- 
mendation paid to his merits by so many respectable per- 
sons in Great Britain, is no less honourable to them than to 
him ; and I verv sincerely concur with you in wishing that 

V ml J O 

the best understanding may always subsist between our 
two nations. 

The fac simile copies of the letters appear to me to be 
well executed, but I am not certain that the taste of this 
country is such as to produce a considerable demand for 
them. I shall immediately put the cards and subscription 
papers into the hands of such persons here, and at New- 
York, as I think most like!}" to promote the object of them. 
For my own part, I am preparing and expect to retire in 
the spring to my estate at Bedford, in the county of West- 
chester, about fifty miles from the city of New- York. I 
shall request the persons to whom the subscription papers 
will be delivered, to transmit them to Mr. Hugh Gaine, a 
bookseller of reputation at New- York ; and shall request 
him to communicate the result to Messrs. Nicoll, &c, in 
London. 

Having, since my return from England, been constantly 
engaged in official affairs, I have had little leisure for other 
pursuits ; so much so that I have not, from that time to this, 
visited my estate more than twice in any one year. 

A member of your board (of whose address 1 took a 
memorandum, which I have since often looked for without 
success) was so obliging as to send me a cask of Ejxs;lish

i. I promised to try it, and inform him whether it 

succeeded. It was ground, and sent 10 my farm, where a 

t of it was used in like manner with French and New- 

mdland gypsum, but not with the like success ; it pro- 
duced no visible effect. On being acquainted with this, I 
directed the remainder to be saved, in order that on my 
removal there. ight be tried under my own direction : 

if I live, this shall be done. 

I lasl : read with attention your proposal for an 

experimental farm. The objects in view are certainly very 
interesting, and to a considerable degree attainable under 
the direction of such a manager as I suspect it would be 
more easy to describe than to find. It would probably be 
advisable to make him a band- llowance percent, on 

the profits, besi vy. 

This country will dern - from all your im- 

provements relative to the breed and management of live- 
stock. But I apprehend that, from the difference between 
your climate and ours, it will in some respects be less easy 
for us to apply and put into practice your improvements 
respecting the growth and cultivation of plants. 

In the year 1784, I had an interesting conversation with 
one of your intelligent farmers in Essex. He was sur- 
prised that we in this country seldom sowed more than one 
bushel of wheal on an acre. On being told that in our good 
land one seed would produce many shoots or straws, he 
observed thai we had better sow an additional bushel, for 
thai tiiese shoots were generally loss productive than single 
straws from single grains. On my return that year to this 
country, I mentioned the remark to some of our best 
farmers. One of them in particular gave it a fair trial for 
several years. He increased his seed in various experi- 
ments, from one bushel to above two bushels per acre ; but 
he finally found and was convinced that not more than one 
bushel and a half per acre could be sowed on his farm with 
advantage : any quantity above that filled the field with too 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 299 

much st 'aw. Hence I conclude that (all other tilings being 
equal) the sari iber of gi ains of seed w heat will thr »w 

out more shoots in this climate than in yours. 

But to return to the experimental farm: it appi -me 

that such an establishment comes naturally within the de- 
partment of the agricultural society; and if instituted by 
them, would enjoy greater advantages, than such an estab- 
lishment if entirely independent and distinct from th 
would posses. 

The more food Great Britain produces, the better; and 
it is plain that by cultivating all your waste lands, and by 
still greater improvements in husbandry, the quantity annu- 
ally produced may and will he exceedingly augmented ; 
yet, sir, it is not quite clear to me, that Great Britain can 
always continue to produce more food than she will con- 
sume. You now manufacture for about five millions of 
people in this country, and for many millions in other coun- 
tries. Consider the rapidity of population in this • untry, 
and in some parts of your extensive empire. Your manu- 
facturers must increase, and they must have food. On this 
topic much might be said, which will readily occur to you. 
With great respect and esteem, I am, sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

John Jay.

Albany, 3d March, 1801. 
Rev. Sir, 

Accept my thanks for your obliging letter of the 9th ult., 
and the interesting discourse which accompanied it. The 
eighteenth century has been distinguished, as you observe, 
by great events. There are some i them so singular 

and apparently so ominous, that the presenl centurj will 
probably not be less signal than the last; especially as 
whole nations are suffering themselves ed from 

their great sovereign by promises of liberty made to them 



300 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

by the servants of corruption, and are desiring and exalting 
rulers who contemptuously refuse to " kiss the Son." 

I perfectly agree with you in the sentiment, that our 
business is to do our duty, and leave events to Him, with- 
out whose appointment and permission nothing comes to 
pass. That duty, however, appears to me to call particu- 
larly on all the ministers of the gospel, to look more to the 
Author and Finisher of our faith than to the expositors of 
it ; and, disregarding the doubtful and mysterious doctrines 
by which the latter have divided Christians from Christians, 
to unite in defending the plain and intelligible faith deliv- 
ered to us by our Redeemer and his apostles. 

With great respect, and the best wishes for your health 
and happiness, 

I am, reverend sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

John Jay.

Bedford, 25th July, 1804. 

My dear Sir, 

The friendship and attachment which I have so long and 
so uniformly experienced from you, will not permit me 
to delay expressing how deeply and sincerely I participate 
with you in the afflicting event* which the public are now 
lamenting, and which you have so many domestic and par- 
ticular reasons to bewail. 

The philosophic topics of consolation are familiar to you, 
and we all know from experience how little relief is to be 
derived from them. May the Author and only Giver of 
consolation be and remain with you. 

With great esteem and affectionate regard, 
I am, my dear sir, 

Your obliged and obedient servant, 

John Jay.

TO MRS. BANYER. 

Bedford, 2d November, 2804. 

My dear Daughter, 

I passed a part of yesterday morning very agreeably in 
writing a letter to you. Happy to learn from your brother 
and sister that your health was fast improving, and well 
knowing the innocent gratifications you were deriving, 
probably "in long perspective" from your dear little boy, 
my letter insensibly grew long, nor could I easily quit these 
-i ML!- topics. 

Last night, I received Mr. Banyer's letter of the 27th. 
You can judge of my feelings on the occasion. It has cast 
a gloom on both families. I have to lament the departure 
of my only grandson, as well as the affliction of my dear 
and affectionate daughter. It is natural that such events 
should excite grief in a high degree; I know this by 
experience, and I know by experience also, that no 
consolation is to be derived from any other source than 
acquiescence in and resignation to the will of God, with- 
out whose appointment or permission nothing comes to 
pass. 

Our Heavenly Father has called this child home, and the 
very best wish that you or I could have formed for him. 
was, that after a long and virtuous abode bore, he might be 
where he now is. We have indeed reason to grieve for 
the comforts we lose by his absence, but not that he is 
where he is. His happiness is now certain, complete, eter- 
nal. Happy shall we all be to arrive finally at the same 
blest abodes; and there to be received by him, and many 
others of our best and dearest friends and kindred. 

Let us all endeavour to become the wiser and be ter f< r 
these chastisements; and remember the expressions of Job 
when all his children w T ere taken away from him. 1 wish, my 
dear Maria, to comfort both you and myself. Let us both

consider these things, and hold fast our confidence in Hirn 
who alone can console and bless us. 

I am, .my dear Maria, 

Your very affectionate father, 

John Jay:

Bedford, 18th October, 1805. 

Sir, 

I have been favoured with your letter of the 2d ultimo, 
respecting the African Free-school in the city of New-York. 
It is, in my opinion, a charitable and useful institution, and 
well entitled to encouragement and support. From your 
account of its present embarrassments, I am induced to think 
that, in order to its being and remaining on a respectable 
and permanent footing, some vigorous and well devised 
measures should be in ken to obtain adequate and durable 
funds. The uncertain donations occasionally solicited and 
expected from charitable, but scattered and unconnected 
individuals, will, probably, be always incompetent, and 
must obviously be too precarious to afford ground for sea- 
sonably calculating the prudence and extent of expenditures. 

The existing debts should doubtless be paid : indeed they 
cannot be paid too soon, and it is desirable that new ones 
be not contracted. For my part, I am persuaded that it 
can very seldom be discreet, for institutions depending on 
charity to contract debts, and then apply to charity to pay 
them. 

What should be done? is the question. Two things 
occur to me, which I will take the liberty to suggest. 

First, The society of Friends in general, and particularly 
those in New- York, have given more patronage to the 
objects connected with this school, than any other society 
or denomination in the State ; and. from circumstances 
peculiar to their association and discipline, they are enabled 



MISCELLANE01 S < ORRESPONDENCE. .'iO.'J 

to pursue and accomplish their objects with more than 
ordinary union and effect. 1 fence, 1 am led to believe, that 
it those of your society in New- York would recommend 
this school to the notice and liberality of their brethren in 
the country, and desire them also to requesl the aid of all 
-disposed persons, of other denominations, in their 
respective neighbourhoods, a considerable sum might he 
collected; especially considering the prudence, as well as 
zeal, with which your affairs arc usually managed. On this, 
or any other plan which would in some degree be general 
through the country, 1 would readil) be one of the con- 
tributors. 

aidly. I submit to your consideration the expediency 
of regularly putting at interest one-tenth of the annual 
income of the school, whatever it may he, and wh ; :ver 
it may arise, and invariably to bring the yearly e\ 
ot the school to a level with the remaining nine-tenths. ( In 
this plan both the principal of the stable funds, and the in- 
come of the school (so far as if comprehended the interest 
ol those lends) would increase from year to year. In time, 
the interest alone would form an income so considerable, as 
to be productive of more good, than if the institution had 
continued to depend and subsist on scanty and precarious 
supplies. 

It may also be well to consider, whether the benevolent 
objects of this institution might not be promoted by an act 
of incorporation, with such provisions in it as would con- 
duce to its stability, and extend its usefulness. 

Be pleased to inform me whether any particular attention 
is paid by the superintendents to the children after they 
have left it, and whether it is part of th plan to endeavour 
to have them bound out to trades, or to service in decent 
families. To me it appears important that they be not left 
entirely either to their parents or to themselves; it being 
difficult to give them good morals, manners, or habits, in 
any other way than by placing them under the care and

their parents generally are. 

With esteem and regard, I am, sir, 

Your obedient servant,

to mrs. banyer. 

Bedford, 29th December, 1805. 
My dear Maria, 

The account of your health contained in your affectionate 
letter of the 12th inst., gave me great pleasure. 

I thank you for the manner in which you mention my 
birth-day, and I believe every word you say on that topic. 
And now, my dear daughter, I will congratulate you on 
the anniversary of a birth-day, without which all our birth- 
days would have been but sad. I mean the nativity of our 
Redeemer. May you see many returns of that anniversary, 
and with still increasing prospects of comfort here, and 
happiness hereafter. 

Last evening your sister received a letter from you, with 
a postscript by ****. Let me hint to you, that neither the 
letters which we write, nor those which we receive, should 
be so frequently communicated as to become a matter of 
course; for, in that case, every omission which prudence 
may require, will naturally lead to conjectures and appre- 
hensions, and sometimes to inquiries and piques, which are 
always unpleasant. Although I am persuaded that these 
reflections are not new to you, yet my solicitude about 
whatever may affect your comfort, prompts me to remind 
you of them. Place full confidence in your husband ; with 
respect to others, be habitually circumspect. These are 
mere general remarks, and not dictated by any fear of their 
being necessary. 

I am, my dear Maria, 

Your very affectionate father, 

John Jay. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPOXDENCE. 3QI 



FROM WILLIAM WILBERFORCE. 

Elmdon-House, near Birmingham, ) 
November 7th, 1805. £ 

T'tlv DEAR SlK, 

I am willing to flatter myself you have not quite forgotten 
the person who is new beginning to address you. He cer- 
tainly has not forgotten you ; on the contrary, he retains a 
lively recollection of the pleasure he derived from your 
society during your residence in this country, and still more 
of the benefit he received, especially on one important occa- 
sion, from your judicious and friendly counsel. He has 
never since ceased to embrace every opportunity of inqui- 
ring after you, and to take an interest in your well-being. 

After this preamble, I proceed to state, that my object in 
now taking up the pen is, to recommend earnestly to your 
serious perusal and impartial consideration, a pamphlet 
which I will take the liberty of transmitting to you, lately 
published, entitled "War in Disguise, or the Frauds of the 
Neutral Flags." It is spoken of in high terms by the most 
intelligent and respectable men I know, and is written, as I 
think you will auree with me, with considerable knowledge 
of its subject, as well as with great spirit and eloquence. 
Its general tenor is so clearly indicated by its title, at least 
to you who are experimentally acquainted with the topics 
of which it treats, that I need say nothing on that head ; I 
will only beg leave to assure you, that I took it up with 
very strong prejudices against the conclusions which I 
understood the author endeavoured to establish, on account 
of the strong disposition I invariably feel to cultivate and 
promote a friendly connexion between our two countries. 
I cannot but be anxious to hear what reception it meets with 
on your side of the Atlantic. That those whose interest is 
at stake will endeavour to raise a cry, is no more than what 
we must expect. Happy shall I be, if this is countervailed 
by the opposite opinion of men of sense, knowledge, and 

VOL. II. — Q Q 



306 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

impartiality. Nothing could have brought me over to the 
doctrines the pamphlet lays down, but a deliberate and firm 
persuasion, that on our practical adoption of them (I would 
not hastily affirm to what extent) depends, according to all 
human appearances, not merely the maritime superiority, 
but the very existence of this empire. The author appears 
to me to have left very short that part of his work in which 
he speaks of the effects, on our marine and our maritime 
interests, of the continuance of the present abuses. The 
work, I happen to know, was written in haste, and in a bad 
state of health ; and though the production of a man who 
was actuated by a sense of duty, and had taken great pains 
to inform himself, it is in some parts faulty, in the compo- 
sition and language especially ; but knowing to whom I am 
writing, it would be mere impertinence to do more than 
introduce it to your notice. I leave it, not without solici- 
tude, but yet with good hope, to your intelligence, experi- 
ence, equity, and temper. 

I heartily wish this may find you in the enjoyment of 
good health and personal comfort. You will not, I trust, 
think it improper egotism if, relying on your friendly 
remembrance, I add, that I thank God I am favoured with 
great domestic felicity, — having a wife and five children, 
the youngest born only about two months ago. I should 
scarcely know where to leave off, if I allowed myself to 
touch on any of those numerous and interesting topics 
which press themselves on my attention while writing to 
you. I will, however, abstain from them all, and take my 
leave ; assuring you that I am ever, with cordial esteem 
and regard, my dear sir, 

Yours very sincerely, 

W. WlLBERFORCE. 

P. S. If you do me the favour to answer this letter, my 
address is always London.

TO WILLIAM WILBERFORCE, LONDON. 

Bedford, Westchester County, State of New- York, ) 

lkh April, 1806. J 

Dear Sir, 

It was not until within a week that I received your 
friendly letter of the 7th November last. It expresses sen- 
timents of esteem and regard which, being mutual, excite 
agreeable recollections and emotions. 

" War in Disguise," of which you was so good as to 
enclose a copy, has given occasion to uneasiness relative to 
the matter and design of it. It contains marks of ability, 
but the author has not been entirely circumspect. I enclose 
an answer to it, written, as is supposed, and as I believe, 
by a gentleman of excellent talents and good dispositions.* 

It appears to me, that every independent state has, as 
such, a perfect right at all times, whether at war or at 
peace, to make grants to and treaties with any other inde- 
pendent state ; but then those acts, in order to be valid, 
must consist with justice, and be in no respect fraudulent. 
To the validity of such grants and treaties, no third power, 
whether belligerent or neutral, can, in my opinion, have 
reasonable cause to object. 

When such acts are fraudulent, and injurious to others, 
those others are justifiable in regarding them as being 
what they are (that is, fraudulent), and in acting accord- 
ingly. When such acts are just and fair, but abused to the 
injury of others, those others have a right to complain of 
and to attack the abuse, but not the thing abused. 

Whether this or that particular act (of the description 
alluded to) be fair or fraudulent, is a question to be decided 
by evidence internal and external, according to the rules 
and maxims of the laws of nations relative to such cases. 

* Gouvemeur Morris. 



308 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

Believing these principles to be well founded, they do 
not permit me to adopt some of the opinions of this ingenious 
writer, nor to approve of all the latitude contended for by 
some of his opponents. To view in their various lights 
and relations, and to examine properly all the doctrines and 
positions in question, cannot be done within the compass of 
a letter. 

Your disposition and desire to promote good- will between 
our two countries exactly accord with my own. It is to 
be wished that each of them may ever be mindful, that the 
preservation of friendship between nations, as between indi- 
viduals, requires justice and prudence always, and even for- 
bearance sometimes ; for states, as well as persons, commit 
errors. It is our lot to live in perplexing and eventful 
times. The passions of men are not good counsellors, and 
never less so than when agitated and inflamed. 

We have seen concluded, with the treaty of Amiens, the 
first act of the astonishing tragedy which the French revo- 
lution has introduced on the theatre of the world. The 
present and succeeding acts will probably be highly inter- 
esting and impressive. In this prodigious drama, Great 
Britain still sustains a conspicuous and important part : 
perhaps she may be employed to restrain the " remainder of 
wrath." Whether this distant nation is to appear among 
the dramatis persona;, cannot now be known. We cer- 
tainly do not desire it. 

The inconveniences apprehended from the death of Mr. 
Pitt will doubtless be diminished, if not obviated, by the 
general confidence reposed in your new administration. I 
am glad to find that Lord Grenville holds a distinguished 
place in it. My respect and esteem for him continue undi- 
minished. 

Very sincerely do I congratulate you on your domestic 
felicity. May it continue and increase. I thank you for 
what you have briefly remarked on that topic ; for you 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 309 

have given me pleasure, by letting me see how much rea- 
son you have to be pleased. 

\\ ith true esteem and regard, I am, dear sir, 

Your faithful and obedient servant, 

John Jay. 

P. S. As your letter was so long on the way, this answer 
will arrive, if it arrives at all, much later than you expected. 
Being anxious to remove appearances of inattention, I shall 
send a duplicate by another vessel. There will then be a 
double chance of its coming to your hands. 

TO WILLIAM P. BEERS. 

Bedford, 18th April, 1807. 
Dear Sir, 

Your letter gave me great pleasure, and the more, as it 
leads me to expect that of seeing you here when a favour- 
able opportunity shall offer. 

I apprehend that several of your remarks relative to 
public affairs are too well founded ; and it is natural that 
they should be so. The operations of certain principles 
and passions are nearly alike in all ages and countries. 

Every modification of sovereignty has its inconveniences 
— there is a better and a worse in them all, and no other 
than a relative perfection in any of them. That ours might 
be rendered less imperfect is more easy to prove than to 
accomplish. It is true, that when the measure of confusion 
runs over, order usually follows ; but it is not always such 
order as would please either you or me. 

The vices and violences of parties, mid the corruptions 
which they generate and cherish, are serious evils ; but 
they are evils which, during the full tide of democracy, 
mere reason will find it difficult to correct, because the 
majority of every people are deficient both in virtue and in 
knowledge. All parties have their demagogues, and dem- 
agogues never were nor will be patriots. Self-interest ex- 



310 LIFE OP JOHN JAY. 

cites and directs all their talents and industry, and by that 
principle they regulate their conduct towards men and 
measures : nor is this all ; they not only act improperly 
themselves, but they diligently strive to mislead the weak, 
the ignorant, and the unwary ; as to the corrupt, they like 
to have it so ; it makes a good market for them. 

Reforms in government are more freo^ently imposed by 
overbearing circumstances, than produced by the influence 
of wisdom on the opinion and choice of the multitude. 
The administration of every government will always be 
able, virtuous, and salutary, or otherwise, according to the 
characters of those to whom it may be committed. The 
rulers in democratic republics are generally men of more 
talents than morals ; there can be but little connexion be- 
tween cunning and virtue, and therefore (except now and 
then in particular instances) our affairs will commonly be 
managed by political intrigues, calculated upon that " auri 
fames" which, from obvious causes, rages in this country. 

New men, new objects, and now designs, will succes- 
sively arise and have their day ; but whether for good or 
for evil, we know not. At present, democracy prevails 
too much ; the time may come when it will prevail too 
little. The human passions naturally vibrate between ex- 
tremes, passing and repassing, but seldom stopping at the 
middle point. 

Things are as they are, and we must make the best of 
them ; as travellers do or ought to do, well knowing that 
in the course of a long journey, they cannot expect to 
have every day fine weather, good inns, good roads, and 
good company. Nothing remains for us but to do our 
duty to our country with prudent and unabated zeal ; to 
enjoy with gratitude and cheerfulness the good we have ; 
and to bear with decencv and dignitv the ills which we 
cannot avert or remove. What may be our duty will 
depend on the circumstances of the day. Those of the 
present day appear to me a little singular in some respects. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPOXDEXCE. 311 

As to the ensuing election for governor, a federal candi- 
date should, in my opinion, have been named. If that had 
been deemed inexpedient, the federal party should, I think, 
have adopted an unequivocal plain line of conduct relative 
to the present candidates, explicitly deciding to vote for 
neither of them ; or openly resolving to support the one 
whom they considered as the least objectionable. In what 
state the election will place our party, is difficult to con- 
jecture, for although advantages will result from it, yet 
"Timco dona fe rentes." 

With great esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir,

Bedford, 13th Sept., 1807. 
Dear Sir, 

I have received your letter of the 2d inst., and expected 
to have answered it this week in person. 3Iv health had 
so much mended, that on Friday last, I rode to Bedford 
for the first time since my return. That ni^ht, rheumatic 
pains in my head, neck, and shoulders came on. They 
have somewhat abated, but still confine me to the house, 
In our journey through life, as in other journeys, our wishes 
cannot always be gratified. Travellers must expect to live 
and fare like travellers. 

You have the gout, and you extract consolation from it ; 
this is good moral chymistry. My rheumatism and your 
gout may perhaps carry us home the farthest way round, 
but not in an easy chair. When we " ruminate past enjoy- 
ments," we taste that tincture of melancholy which their 
departure and other associated circumstances infuse : it 
nevertheless affords a kind of pleasure which, like some 
medical wine, is not only better than no wine, but perhaps 
in some respects more salutary than pure wine. 



312 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

The half a century you speak of, has given us some 
knowledge and experience, both of men and things. That

Dear Sir, 

I received by the last mail, and have read with great 
pleasure, your obliging letter of the 1 1th inst. The informa- 
tion it conveys cannot fail of being grateful to all who prefer 
the wise and upright policy which distinguished the admin- 
istration of Washington, to that which of late has distressed 
and disgraced our country. How fir the favourable changes 
which have taken place are imputable to patriotic and cor- 
rect principles, time and experience only can decide. Sin- 
cerely do I wish that all our elections may manifest the 
prevalence of such principles ; but I am not sanguine in my 
expectations of it. Personal and pecuniary considerations 
appear to have acquired a more than ordinary degree of 
influence. Many sacrifices of public good have, and will 
yet be made to them. On the exertions of the virtuous and 
intelligent much will always depend ; should they become 
relaxed, by a sense either of security or of fatigue, we shall 
probably lose the ground we have gained. I brought with 
me into retirement the same affection for our country by 
which I have always been actuated, and you rightly judge 
that nothing which is of importance to the public can be a 
matter of indifference to me. 

I am, dear sir, 
With sincere esteem and regard,

TO JUDGE PETERS. 

Bedford, 24th July, 1809. 
Dear Sir, 

Soon after receiving your letter of the 18th of September 
last, I was called to Albany by the death of the only remain- 
ing child of my daughter, whose grief for the loss of her 
son and of her husband was still fresh and severe. 

I returned on the 3d of November with a pain on my 
side, which the doctor ascribed to an obstruction in the 
liver. The complaint increased, and kept me in close con- 
finement during the winter and spring. It reduced me to 
such a state of debility, that I have as yet regained only 
sufficient strength to ride two or three miles at a time. I 
am better, but not well, and it is uncertain whether I ever 
shall be ; such mementoes are useful, though unpleasant, and 
therefore I ought to make the best of them. 

Your remarks relative to plaster will induce me, if I live, 
to extend the application of it to' the various objects you 
mention. I directed it to be freely used in the garden this 
spring, and am pleased with the results. The effect of 
plaster on vegetation is to me a mystery ; if it acts only by 
attracting water, why does the ground (as some say) grow 
tired of it, and require a supply of common manure to 
renew the efficacy of it. Often-repeated experiments, and 
long continued observation, naturally lead to important dis- 
coveries ; but the very limited duration of human life rarely 
allows sufficient time for the talents and perseverance of 
any individual to arrive at their "ne plus." Here the ante- 
diluvians had the advantage of us, and many of them doubt- 
less made the most of it. Hence it may be presumed that 
they carried many of the useful arts, as well as those which 
belong to the departments of vice, to a higher degree of 
perfection than they are at present. To me it does not 
appear improbable, that the celebrated works of remote

antiquity, were not a little indebted to information which 
passed through the flood. 

National interest unites, with other considerations, in 
drawing our attention to agriculture. I think it has greatly 
improved in our country since the revolution, and there is 
reason to believe that the " resuscitation" you are attempt- 
ing would be generally useful. I wish it may be effected, 
but unless a number of gentlemen, well qualified for the 
purpose, will heartily and diligently unite with you, I fear 
your endeavours will not be so successful as they are com- 
mendable. 

You are right in supposing that we are much of an age. 
In December next, I shall have lived sixty-four years — a 
long course of years when to come — a dream when past. 
But whether life is, or is not composed of " such stuff as 
dreams are made of," it is a valuable gift, and is capable of 
many enjoyments, to be found by all who rationally seek 
and use them. Among the enjoyments which men derive 
from each other, those which arise from such social inter- 
course as you allude to, certainly are to be placed in the 
first class. This class, however, like the first class of almost 
every species of good, has more items in theory than in 
actual experience. 

I think with you that the Spaniards deserve credit for 
the spirit they have exhibited. There are fine points in 
their character. In a conversation respecting them, with 
the late Abbe Mably, he said, " Monsieur, ils sont plus 
hommes que nous." This was a great deal for a French- 
man to say. I sincerely wish them success, but my ex- 
pectations of it have not been sanguine. Their hatred of 
France, and their attachment to their religion, &c, may 
continue to stimulate their indignation and their valour; 
but it does not appear to me that their opposition has been, 
or probably will be, so managed as to prove effectual. As 
yet, there has been no display of civil or military talents 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 315 

equal to the occasion; we may guess, but we cannot 
prophecy. 

Perilous times have descended upon all Europe, and Bona- 
parte seems to be the Nebuchadnezzar of the day. Divines 
say, that in prophetic language nations are called seas. 
According to that language, Europe is a tempestuous and 
a raging ocean ; and who can tell which of the governments 
afloat upon it will escape destruction or disaster ? Some 
dark clouds from that tempest have reached, and lately 
obscured, our political sky ; nor has it again become quite 
serene and clear. This country, as well as others, will 
experience deep distress ; but I do not believe that you or 
I will live to see it. From transitory and ordinary evils 
we cannot expect to be exempt. We may suffer from rash 
experiments, from the pressure of fraternal embraces or 
resentments, from the machinations of demagogues, and 
gradually from the corruption incident to the love of money, 
&c; but, for my own part, I do not apprehend any thing 
like the speedy approach of an " overturn." You have had 
a democratic tornado at Philadelphia. It did but little 
harm ; perhaps it did some good. I found it gave you 
something to do ; and I found also, as I expected, that you 
did it. Too many in your State, as in this, love pure 
democracy dearly. They seem not to consider that pure 
democracy, like pure rum, easily produces intoxication, and 
with it a thousand mad pranks and fooleries. Ebriety, 
whether moral or physical, is dillicult to cure ; and the more 
so, as such patients cannot easily be convinced of the value 
and the necessity of temperance and regimen. 

I observe that I have written a long letter. Feeling a 
little fatigued, I must forego the pleasure of adding much 
to it. It is pleasant to think loud in safe company, and I 
sometimes allow myself that indulgence in writing. 

I am, dear sir, 

Yours affectionately, 

John Jay.

FROM WILLIAM WILBERFORCE. 

East Bourne, Sussex, 1st Aug., 1809. 

My dear Sir, 

Though so many years have passed since we saw or 
heard from each other, I hope I do not deceive myself 
when I presume that we continue to retain each other in 
friendly remembrance, not without taking a real interest in 
each other's well being. Such, at least, I can truly declare, 
are my own sentiments and feelings in relation to you; and 
embracing every opportunity of inquiring after you, I 
heard with sincere pleasure, the other day, from an Ameri- 
can acquaintance, that you were living in health and com- 
fort, though retired from public life. But why do I say, 
though retired, when I can most sincerely aver, that with a 
view to health and comfort, and those of mind as well as 
of body, no situation in life has ever presented itself to my 
imagination under so hopeful a form as that which my 
favourite poet describes as " domestic life in rural leisure 
■passed" I forget whether you are a lover of poetry ; if 
you were so when you were young, I think that even in 
advanced life the author of the above line, Cowper, will 
still be dear to you. His piety gives unfading charms to 
his compositions. But I am in danger of expending all the 
time for which I must venture to detain you, without pro- 
ceeding to the business which gives me occasion, an occasion 
which, I own, I am glad to seize, to address you after so 
long a silence. I am aware, indeed, that your retirement 
may prevent your taking any part in public, even in the 
case I am about to mention ; still your opinion, your good 
wishes may be useful to us. Since the abolition of the 
slave-trade, an institution has been formed consisting of a 
considerable number of the most respectable members of 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 317 

both houses of parliament, as well as of other men of con- 
sideration and worth, with the Duke of Gloucester at our 
head, for the purpose of promoting civilization and im- 
provement in Africa. Of course, all our hopes are 
grounded and bottomed in the cessation of the slave-trade. 
Now, from the operation of the war, and of other causes, 
this traffic is stopped, with a very trilling exception, which 
though trifling, we are trying, and that successfully, to do 
away throughout all that immense part of the continent of 
Africa which is north of the line, and indeed much further ; 
unless as it may be carried on by your countrymen and 
our own, in direct violation of the laws of both countries. 
We trust we shall be able, by sending ships of w r ar to 
scour the coast of Africa, to suppress the British slave- 
trade ; but this will be of little avail, if the traffic may still 
be carried on in fact, though prohibited by law, by the 
American slave-trader ; nor do I see any prospect of pre- 
venting this abuse, unless a convention could be made 
between the two countries, by which the ships of war of 
each should be authorized and even encouraged (by the 
hopes of gaining by the forfeitures) to seize and bring in 
for adjudication the vessels of the other, when prosecuting 
this unlawful commerce. I rather believe there is another 
particular in which it still remains for your country to ren- 
der its law similar to ours, by subjecting to forfeiture any 
ship of any country, and under any flag, which is fitted out 
in and cleared out from an American port. Now, my 
dear sir, may I hope for your assistance towards the pro- 
duction of the effects I have specified ? Knowing to whom 
I am writing, I will say no more on this head. 

I cannot address you without tracing my way to the 
period when we were last together, through the long and 
interesting interval which lies between that and the present 
moment. What events have since happened ! What 
events may take place in the same number of years yet to 
come ! How many whom we loved have gone in the last 



318 LIFE OP JOHN JAY. 

thirteen years ! How many will go in the next ! How 
strongly, my dear sir, are we' admonished to place our 
happiness on a firmer and more secure basis, than it can 
enjoy in this world, which never more than of late verified 
the character given of it by one of our greatest and best 
churchmen, Hooker, that it is full (made up, I think he 
says) of perturbations. How astonishing is it to see men 
of penetrating understandings, and of deep and large 
views, confining their regards to this limited scene, appa- 
rently insensible to the existence of any thing beyond it ! 
But I beg pardon for thus running on, and I stop before my 
pen has got the mastery of me. I will detain you no 
longer than while I express my hopes that you are well 
and happy, and assure you that I shall never cease to take 
an interest in your welfare. 

I remain, with respect and regard, 
My dear sir, 
Your obliged and faithful servant, 

W. WlLBERFORCE. 

P. S. If you favour me with a reply, may I take the 
liberty of asking after your family 1 I married about two 
years after you left England, and am surrounded, I thank 
God, by an excellent wife and children. I trust I do not 
deceive myself in the persuasion that you will not be un- 
interested in this statement, for which therefore I will not 
use the affectation of apologizing. I will take the liberty 
of sending you a copy of the African Institution's reports. 
You will also see in it a list of the members. 

TO WILLIAM WlLBERFORCE. 

Bedford, 8th November, 1809. 
Dear Sir, 
On the 28th ult. I received your letter of the 1st of Au- 
gust last, and I thank you for it, and for the pamphlets 
enclosed with it. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 319 

I am well persuaded that your sentiments relative to me 
are such as you describe ; and I assure you that mine rela- 
tive to you correspond with them. 

The patrons of the abolition act, and of the African Insti- 
tution, certainly do honour, and will probably do more than 
ordinary good to Great Britain ; against whom complaints 
have ascended both from Asia and Africa. It is pleasing 
to behold a nation assiduously cultivating the arts of peace 
and humanity in the midst of war, and while strenuously 
fighting for their all, kindly extending the blessings of Chris- 
tianity and civilization to distant countries. 

That your and our governments should co-operate in 
rendering their respective laws against the slave trade 
effectual, is to me very desirable, and I believe that a con- 
vention for the purpose would be approved by all, who 
think and feel as you and I do respecting that base and 
cruel traffic. Whether the times are propitious to such a 
convention, is another question. Negotiations are said to 
be pending between our government and Mr. Jackson. I 
can discern no objection to his being instructed to propose 
such a measure. They who offer to do what is fit and right 
to be done, cannot be losers by it. I can do but little — 
that little shall be done. 

The information you give me respecting your family, 
and your friendly inquiries concerning mine, gratify me 
not a little. I rejoice that while perturbation reigns abroad, 
you enjoy in tranquillity at home the comforts mentioned 
in the 128th Psalm. 

In my family there have been, since the date of my last 
letter, some painful and some pleasing events. Death has 
deprived my eldest daughter of an excellent husband, and 
of the only two children which she had. On the other 
hand, my son has gradually recovered his health, and has 
married an amiable young lady, who, about a year ago, 
brought him a son. My other children- are well, and doing 
well. 



320 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

As to myself, sickness confined me to the house last win- 
ter, and I am still more of an invalid than a convalescent. 
However difficult the task, such visitations should be re- 
ceived and borne with grateful, as well as patient resig- 
nation. 

The observation you cite from Hooker is very just, and 
so are your remarks on this turbulent and transitory scene. 
To see things as they are, to estimate them aright, and to 
act accordingly, is to be wise. But you know, my dear 
sir, that most men, in order to become wise, have much to 
unlearn as well as to learn, much to undo as well as to do. 
The Israelites had little comfort in Egypt, and yet they 
were not very anxious to go to the promised land. Fig- 
uratively speaking, we are all at this day in Egypt, and a 
prince worse than Pharaoh reigneth in it. Although the 
prophet " like unto Moses" offers to deliver from bondage, 
and invites us to prepare and be ready to go with him, 
under Divine guidance and protection, to the promised land ; 
yet great is the number who prefer remaining in slavery 
and dying in Egypt. 

If this letter should reach you, be so good as to let me 
know it, and name some person in London to whose care 
I may transmit future ones for you. 

With the best wishes for your health and happiness, and 
with real esteem and regard, I am, dear sir, 

Your faithful and obedient servant, 

John Jay.

Bedford, lGth August, 1809. 
Dear Sir, 
I this morning received your letter of the 9th inst., with 
the interesting sermon which it enclosed, and I thank you 
for them both. 

A proper history of the United States would have much 
to recommend it : in some respects it would be singular, or 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 321 

unlike all others ; it would develop the great plan of Provi- 
dence, for causing this extensive part of cur world to be 
discovered, and these "uttermost parts of the earth" to be 
gradually filled with civilized and Christian people and 
nations. The means or second causes by which this great 
plan has long been and still is accomplishing, arc materials 
for history, of which the writer ought well to know the use 
and bearings, and proper places. In my opinion, the histo- 
rian, in the course of the work, is never to lose sight of that 
great plan. 

Remarkable interpositions of Divine Providence arc fine 
subjects, but the exhibition cannot have a full effect, unless 
accompanied with a distinct view of the objects and state 
of things to which they relate ; it is by discerning how 
admirably they are accommodated and fitted to answer 
their intended purposes, that the reader is made to reflect 
and feel properly. 

Few anions us have time and talent for such a work. I 
am pleased with the prospect of your undertaking it ; and I 
do believe, that with a due allowance of time, that is, of sev- 
eral years, you would execute it well. 

As to aid from me, I am far more willing than able to 
assist you. I became sick last autumn, and have not had a 
well day since. Although better, I am still feeble ; and can 
neither bear much exercise, nor much employment of any 
kind : even in reading and in writing, I find it necessary to 
be abstemious. 

I regret the circumstances which deprived me of the 
pleasure of receiving a visit from you; for no conversations 
are more agreeable to me, than those with persons whom I 
esteem, and in which the utile and the duke arc blended. 
With the best wishes for your health and happiness, 

I am, dear sir, 
Your affectionate and obedient servant, 

John Jay.

322 MFE OF JOHN JAY. 



TO JUDGE PETERS. 

Bedford, 26th February, 1810:, 
Dear Sir, 
After lingering through the summer, I found my disorder 
gradually returning in the autumn. Since the middle of 
November I have been confined to the house ; but have as 
yet suffered less this winter than I did the last. At times, 
however, I seemed to be approaching that state, in which 
" a grasshopper is a burden.'' When I took up my pen, it 
was not because it was pleasant, but because it was neces- 
sary. The late tine weather has done me good. I have 
walked on the piazza, and breathed mild fresh air. I feel 
less relaxed, and think it probable that the spring will again 
relieve me. The " carpe diem" reminds me that I should 
take this opportunity of writing to you, and to a few others 
whom I have apparently neglected. 

From your letter I can perceive what your feelings have 
been and are. When afflictions make us wiser and better, 
they answer their purpose ; and they do so when they pro- 
duce the acquiescence and resignation you mention. A 
traveller has great reason for regret, when a faithful and 
affectionate friend and companion leaves him on the road j 
but that regret is softened by the expectation of meeting 
again at the end of the journey. To you it will readily 
occur that we are all travellers ; some in coaches, others 
on foot ; some lodge in good inns, and others where the 
night finds them. Some press forward with an eye to 
" the promised land," while many others loiter and revel 
on the way, with as little concern about where they are 
going, as the horses by which they are drawn or carried, 
•fee. &c. He did not speak much at random, who said, 
" The greatest miracle to man is man." 

Our political sky still continues to grow more and more 
dark and threatening. Whether the clouds will quietly 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 323 

disperse and disappear, or whether they portend a storm, 
is uncertain. The present tempestuous state of the world 
does not encourage us to expect a long season of uninter- 
rupted fair weather. If peace has been and is in our 
power, it would be mortifying to be involved in war unne- 
cessarily. There came forth with the French revolution a 
spirit of delusion, which, like an influenza, passed over and 
infected all Europe. Even our distant country has not 
entirely escaped. Great is the number among us, of whom 
it may be said, that, "Seeing they have not perceived, and 
hearing they have not understood." Delusions have their 
errands, and are sent for some purpose different from that 
of promoting unanimity and peace. But be these things 
as they may, it is a consoling reflection that He who rules 
all, rules wisely. 

I will now turn to a more pleasing topic. On conversing 
with a gentleman who visited me last summer, about the 
damage said to be often done to pear-trees by lightning, he 
observed that the damage in question proceeded, in his 
opinion, more frequently from disease than from lightning. 
That on seeing the upper branches of one of his pear-trees 
to be withering, he examined them often, and found them 
to be dying from the extremities downwards. After some 
time he took off all those branches below the mortification, 
cutting through sound healthy wood. The tree soon began 
to flourish. It put forth new and strong shoots, and has 
since been as thrifty as the others. 

Something a little like this happened last year in my 
garden. A frost took my watermelons when they were 
about as large as a marble. They turned black, and 
dropped off. The ends of the vines began to die, and con- 
tinued to do so for some days. I then had the vines cut 
below the mortified part, and the whole well sprinkled with 
plaster. They recovered, and brought some, though not 
much fruit to perfection.. 

I believe that you and I derive more real satisfaction 



324 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

from attending to our vines and fruit-trees, than most con- 
querors do from cultivating their favourite laurels. 

At present I indulge the expectation of being able to bid 
a cheerful welcome to the spring, and to participate a little 
in the enjoyments of it, notwithstanding the wickedness or 
folly which may abound in high places. That you may 
share largely and for many years in these and other enjoy- 
ments, is sincerely the wish of, 

Dear sir, 
Your affectionate and obedient servant, 

John Jay. 

from william wilberforce. 

Kensington-gore, near London, ) 
July 18th, 1810. S 

My dear Sir, 

Calling to mind the friendly spirit which animates your 
letters to me, I am not ashamed of being deemed imperti- 
nently selfish, when I commence my reply to your last very 
obliging communication of November, 1809, by telling you 
that about a year and three-quarters ago, I changed my 
residence, and find myself in the habitation which my family 
now occupies, and which we find more salubrious than 
Clapham Common. We are just one mile from the turn- 
pike gate at Hyde Park corner, which I think you will not 
have forgotten yet, having about three acres of pleasure- 
ground around my house, or rather behind it, and several 
old trees, walnut and mulberry, of thick foliage. I can sit 
and read under their shade, which I delight in doing, with 
as much admiration of the beauties of nature (rememberino- 
at the same time the words of my favourite poet : nature is 
hut an effect, wliosc cause is God), as if I were two hun- 
dred miles from the great city. 

My parliamentary duties force me to be within easy 
reach of London all the winter, and even spring, and some- 
times for a part of the summer. I have a very affectionate 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 325 

wife, who is always unwilling to be at a distance from me ; 
and Providence has blest us with six children, the eldest 
of whom is hot quite twelve, the youngest under two years 
of age. My family are breathing pure air, and taking exer- 
cise quietly and without restraint, while I am in the harness 
at St. Stephens, or, to continue the metaphor, in a very 
good stable just opposite Westminster Hall, where I com- 
monly, or rather chiefly take both my food and rest during 
the whole session, often being unable to come over to Ken- 
sington-gore from Monday morning to Saturday night; 
always, however, within call, should domestic matters 
require my presence. 

I was not aware that my egotism would be so tedious, 
yet again let me confess that I am not afraid of subjecting 
myself, with you, to any severity of censure. When I have 
a regard for any one, I like to know his habits of life, times, 
places, &c, and I recollect with pleasure, that you kindly 
gave me an account of your family matters, and of your 
present situation and pursuits. Let me beg you to be so 
obliging as to continue so to do, in any letter which you may 
do me the favour to write ; next, let me not forget to inform 
you, that your friendly packet of the 8th November last, of 
which I received duplicates first, brought me two copies of 
your favour of 14th April, 1800, for which, however late, 
accept my best thanks. In conformity with the kind wish 
you express, that I should name to you some person in 
London to whom your letters may be addressed, let me 
name Robert Barclay, Esq. (the great brewer), or Samuel 
Hoare, Esq., the banker, both of whom I think you knew. 

I wish I could recollect with certainty, how many of the 
reports of the African Institution I sent you. I will, how- 
ever, transmit to you either to New- York or Philadelphia, 
accordingly as on inquiry I shall judge best, all the reports 
but the first. Indeed on consideration, I will send them all, 
as you may promote our common object, by giving away 
any copies you do not wish to retain. 



326 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

I am grieved to tell you, that both your countrymen and 
my own are still carrying on the abominable traffic in hu- 
man flesh, in spite of the abolition laws of their respective 
countries. I trust that a continuance of the vigorous 
methods we are using to carry our law into effect, will by 
degrees force our commercial men to employ their substance 
in some more innocent commerce. It has given me no 
little pleasure, to find all your several ministers (both Mr. 
King, Mr. Monroe, and Mr. Pinckney) warmly disposed 
to co-operate, so far as they properly could in their peculiar 
situation ; and I am not without hopes of a practical, though 
not a formal adoption of the only effectual expedient for 
suppressing the slave trade, that of the armed vessels of 
both our countries taking the slave ships of the other as well 
as those of its own. There might be objections, though I 
own I can see none of sufficient importance to outweigh 
the countervailing benefits to a regular compact between 
our two countries for the above purpose ; but it will answer 
the same end, provided we respectively abstain from claim- 
ing any of our vessels which may have been captured when 
engaged in the slave trade. I have received, within a few 
weeks, the opinion of your attorney-general in its practical 
tendency in favour of the system I am wishing to see estab- 
lished. 

My dear sir, I know not how I have been able, .with the 
pen in my hand, to abstain so long from expressing the sin- 
cere and great pleasure it has given me to find affairs taking 
a more favourable turn between our two countries. I can 
only account for my not breaking out on this topic, on my 
first sitting down to write to you, by the consideration that 
when once there is a favourable issue in any case, in which 
we have been receiving or communicating from time to 
time the tidings of the day, with extreme anxiety and ear- 
nestness (the French word empressement better expresses 
what I mean), as for instance in the case of the illness of a 
friend, we become so cool that we perhaps forget to inquire 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 327 

about, or to name at all, the very topic on which, during the 
state of suspense, \vc were continually asking for or giving 
intelligence with such feverish solicitude. Really, the idea 
of a war between our two countries is perfectly horrible; 
and I am really happy to say, that I think in this country 
this most just sentimo.it 'rains ground. Like all proposi- 
tions which are founded in truth and reason, it gradually 
sinks into the minds of men, and though perhaps slowly and 
inscnsiUy. by degrees it leavens nearly the whole mass. It 
will tend to produce this friendly disposition on your side of 
the water, if mere of your countrymen would come over and 
live awhile among us. We are an idle people ; we are a 
busy people, and may not have leisure or disposition to pay 
all the personal attentions which politeness might prescribe; 
but I am persuaded that any gentleman of character and 
moderation who should visit this country, would meet with 
such a friendly reception as would show him that the cir- 
cumstance of our being the descendants of common pro- 
genitors is not forgotten, or rather, that it is reviving and 
diffusing itself with increasing force. 

Before I conclude, let me express the satisfaction it gave 
me to find that you were safely laid up, if I may so express 
it, in a comfortable and tranquil harbour, after having figur- 
atively as well as literally been so long, or at least so often, 
tossed on the stormy sea of public life. May I confess to 
you, at very near 51 only in years, but with only a weakly 
constitution and after having been in parliament very near 
thirty years, that I begin to look forward to the same seces- 
sion from public life ; meaning, however, to form no positive 
determination for the future, but to follow the leadings of 
Providence, and do on the day the duties of the day. 

In three or four years, my four boys, the eldest espe- 
cially, will be attaining that period of life when a father's 
eye and tongue may be most useful and necessary to their 
future well-doing; and really the business of parliament 
has increased so much of late years, as to render it next 



328 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

to impossible for any man who cannot live for six or seven 
months in every year with a very small proportion of food 
or sleep, especially the latter, to attend at all, as he would 
otherwise be glad to do, to domestic or social claims. 
Then let me add, — and if you will take it as intended in 
the way of a hint to yourself, excuse only my freedom 
in giving it, and you will not greatly mistake my meaning : 
any man who has acted his part at all creditably on the 
stage of public life, may render very great service to man- 
kind, especially to his own countrymen, with whose opin- 
ions, prejudices, and errors he is well acquainted, by his 
pen ; for instance, by bearing testimony to the truth of the 
position winch, however trite, it is still useful now and then 
to repeat and enforce, that honesty is the best policy, &c. 

I happen to have just now many claims of an epistolary 
nature, which have been too long neglected, owing to my 
having left them, as in your case, to be attended to w r hen 
the recess of parliament should afford me a little more 
leisure. Much writing also affects my breathing. I must 
therefore conclude. But before I lay down my pen, let me, 
recollecting your kindly opening your mind to me on one 
important occasion, in, I think, 1795 (or 1796), beg that 
w r hen you next write to me, you would favour me by telling 
me how you would vote, &c, if you were in our House of 
Commons, on the question of parliamentary reform. I do 
not ask you to take the trouble of entering into a detailed 
statement of the premises which may lead you to form your 
judgment on that point, whatever it may be ; I wish only 
(unless you have a little leisure) for your conclusion. I 
will ow^n to you, that one main motive with me for having 
supported, on a late occasion, the motion for parliamentary 
reform, was the persuasion that by taking away what must 
be confessed to be a blemish or blot, in an assembly which 
is professedly formed on the principle of representation, we 
are lessening the power of bad men to misrepresent and 
defame our constitution, and to mislead the well-intentioned

but perhaps less acute and long-sighted, into a concurrence 
in their measures. 2dly, it' the measure should be adopted at 
all, it is desirable that it should be so at a time when, as is 
really the case now, notwithstanding the confident assur- 
ances of such men as Cobbett and his adherents, the country 
feels coolly on the subject, and is therefore not likely to 
push its representatives to go dangerous lengths; for I think 
you will agree with me, that it is a species of reform, all 
things considered, concerning which, in this country and at 
this time, it is better of the two not to go quite far enough, 
than to go too far. 

Farewell, my dear sir, and believe me, with cordial 
esteem and regard, 

Your faithful servant, 

W. WlLBERPORCE. 

P.S. As I shall be sending you a parcel, and I do not 
recollect that 1 ever begged your acceptance of a religious 
publication, which I first sent into the world the year I mar- 
ried (and what I say of wedded life, I thank heaven I should 
not now alter), let me now transmit it as a testimony of my 
esteem and regard. It was, in truth, principally intended 
for the use of my friends, and therefore I may send it to you 
with great propriety. I will also accompany it with an- 
other on the slave trade. May these books preserve in 
your family the memorial of our friendly, connexion, and if 
you will not call me impertinent, I will request from you 
some similar memorial. 

TO WILLIAM WIL6ERF0RCE. 

Bedford, 25th October, 1810. 
Dear Sir, 
On the 13th instant I received and read with great plea- 
sure your interesting and friendly letter of the 18th July 
last. There are several topics in it on which I should like 
to converse with you: they shall be noticed in some future 

VOL. II. T T 



330 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

letters. As I cannot write or read much at a time without 
fatigue, I shall confine myself at present to the one on which 
you express a wish to know my sentiments. 

A satisfactory answer to the question of " reform," can 
only result from a judicious selection and combination of 
the reasons and circumstances which bear relation to it. 
Of many of these my information is so imperfect, as that 
it would be rash to form a decided judgment. I have not 
sufficient data whereon to calculate, whether so much good 
may reasonably be expected from such a measure, as would 
justify the risk of inconveniences, to which every important 
innovation is more or less liable. 

The principles of the English constitution appear to 
require that the whole number of representatives should 
be fairly apportioned among the whole number of electors. 
But I have observed nothing in it which even implies what 
is called " universal suffrage." It is not a new remark, 
that they who own the country are the most fit persons to 
participate in the government of it. This remark, with 
certain restrictions and exceptions, has force in it ; and 
applies both to the elected and the electors, though with most 
force to the former. 

I do not know what the proposed plan of reform precisely 
is. J{ it be only to apportion the representatives among 
the counties, or other convenient election districts, whether 
now existing, or to be instituted, according to the number 
of their respective electors ; I should consider it as being a 
just and constitutional measure, and should adopt it, unless 
some existing or impending circumstances should render it 
unseasonable. I am the more inclined to this opinion by 
the present state of your aristocracy, which is such, as not 
unnaturally to excite a jealousy that it will obtain, if it has 
not already obtained, an undue ascendency. The French 
revolution has so discredited democracy, and it has so few 
influential advocates in Europe, that I doubt its giving you 
much more trouble. On the contrary, there seems to be a 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. .'}H1 

danger of its depreciating too much. Without a portion 
of it there can be no free government. What that portion 
should be in England, is a question to which your constitu- 
tion affords, in my opinion, the best answer. To pi -serve 
balances in times like these, isdifficult; mere palliative -pro 
hac vice expedients seldom produce durable good. They 
so frequently violate sound established principles, as rarely 
to prevent more trouble than they cause. The fluctuation 
ot human affairs occasionally imposes changes on nations 
as well as on individuals, to which they find it necessary 
and prudent to accommodate, by corresponding or by coun- 
tervailing changes. These, if made considerately and in 
season, generally conduce to security and order. Whether, 
during the rage and range of democracy, your aristocracy 
received greater accessions of strength than the public 
safety and sound policy required, I do not know. There 
seems, however, to be reason to apprehend, that when 
things return to a calm and settled course, the commons 
will feel the influence of the lords out of doors, and conse- 
quently within doors, in a greater degree than the constitu- 
tion allows. If so, that consideration becomes an argument 
in favour of the proposed " reform." 

I will add an observation which strikes me as having: 
weight. Some of the boroughs appear to have degenerated 
into a mere mean, by which opulent political leaders supply 
themselves with able and active partisans and advocates. 
These, although received in parliament as members, are in 
fact and truth the representatives of their employers, and 
not of the nation. It must be admitted that these employ- 
ers have often taken into their service men of great talents, 
and in many instances, of great worth. Wise and good 
borough-holders, like wise and good kings, doubtless wish 
and endeavour to make the best appointments ; but ought 
either borough-holders or kings to appoint representatives 
for the nation ?

from judge peters. 

Belmont, Nov. 25th, 1810. 

Dear Sir, 

When I sent you, as a token of my constant remem- 
brance, my melange about the Tunis sheep, I intended to 
have written a letter to accompany it. But it seems that 
nothing must go with a pamphlet but the mere direction, 
under the pains and penalties of sousing the correspondent 
or addressee in all costs of enormous postage. It is really 
true, that now, for nearly six years, I have abandoned wine 
and all stimulants, segars and rich food included. Every 
thing increasing and accelerating the blood is hostile to my 
health, and produces my constitutional malady, an accumu- 
lation of blood on the brain. This will, at the appointed 
time, produce my French-leave of all sublunary things. 
Finding that health and rich living were incompatible, I 
took the resolution to abandon old habits, and have sacredly 
kept it. I find myself, without abstemiousness in plain food, 
healthy generally, and, what I think contributes much to 
preserve health, innocently cheerful. I have now and then 
(in winter the worst) attacks of vertigo, which cupping 
or the lancet, timely applied, remove. This, you may 
say, is a history of my secrets. You and I are on a par in 
age and other circumstances, and may trust one another. 

Speltz is an excellent and useful grain. You can see an 
account of it in our first volume, p. 260. I have often 
sowed it ; but, unless you are near a shelling-mill, you must 
give it to your horses. I abandoned the culture of it only 
because I had to send it a great distance for this operation. 
There is a great variety. Some produces whiter flour than 



miscellaneous coRRr.srox i>::\< ;:. :!:',.'} 

wheat; some as black as rye. Apropos: General Arm- 
strong sent from Paris to me about two quarts of the most 
extraordinary rye I ever beheld. Under my rage for dif- 
fusion, I gave away, in all quarters of our State, spoonfuls, 
till I left myself only half a pint, which is now vigorously 
growing. I wrote to him to procure a tierce or hogshead 
for me ; but I suppose my letter miscarried. I shall renew 
my request now he has got back to us. If he can spread 
this rye plentifully through our country, he will do more 
good than all our intercourse with the French Belial has 
done harm. The flour of this rye is like that of wheat, and 
it weighs sixty-four or sixty-live pounds per bushel. All 
our rye has depreciated here. You must make to me some 
grains of allowance for my antithesis about French inter- 
course ; for this has done more harm than all their rye is 
worth. I find myself with a wry face whenever I think of 
our Gallic prostrations. 

Our second volume is nearly finished. 1 have been 
obliged to write too much, to fill up the chasms. It is too 
Herculean a task to keep alive agricultural publications, 
and I shall give up a labour which rolls back on me like 
the stone of Sisyphus. I have just sent the preface to the 
press. You will see that for lack of a more tangible monu- 
ment to our departed Confucius, I have erected one out of 
my ink-pot, with a goose's feather. You may say, when 
you see it, that any one could tell the feather belonged to a 
goose ; but it will prove the scarcity of agricultural matter 
even for a preface. With all this, I think it will be a good 
publication, and much better than I expected. The great 
desideratum is, to get people to read such books. I have 
published with the memoirs — as the players say. by par- 
ticular desire — my plaster book, newly vamped. Being 
tormented by excuses to dozens of requests to obtain new 
facts on plaster — the thorough-bass being dread of criti- 
cism — I have told a story for the petty critics in the preface 
(pushed for matter) which will probably bring the wasps 



334 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

on me, and not procure a single correspondent to satisfy 
my agricultural curiosity. When it is finished I will send 
it to you. I sincerely wish you may pass a better winter 
than you seem to express a hope of experiencing, amd am, 
Most affectionately, yours, 

Richard Peters. 

P.S. Turn Pandora's box bottom upwards, and get hope 
out first. Dr. Logan called on me with a new-invented mi- 
crometer, to measure the filaments of wool, whereof he was 
the bearer for our society. The filament sent with the 
instrument was T oYo o parts of an inch in fineness, and no 
doubt selected. My Tunis wool is considerably finer. He 
says they find in England that they have over-manufac- 
tured, and the rage is turning to agriculture. There is no 
bullion, and paper has depreciated. He saw store cattle 
that would not sell here for more than 815, sell at fairs for 
£15 sterling in paper. A milch cow and calf, worth here 
$25, sold for £20 sterling. A universal wish to be in 
friendship with us was expressed by all people of all grades 
in society. Lord Wellesley told him that he had in his office 
proofs of an offer from Bonaparte, to divide this country 
with England. He gives me many entertaining pieces of 
information which my paper obliges me to omit. 

TO JUDGE PETERS. 

Bedford, January, 1811. 

Dear Sir, 

I have received your letter of the 25th November. 
Although the privations you voluntarily submit to, exceed 
the " ne quid nimis" of the wise man, they evince a sound 
mind, and will, I hope, tend to preserve it long in a sound 
body. 

My inquiries respecting speltz were in terms too general. 
To sow wheat here is like taking a ticket in a lottery ; 
more blanks than prizes. The fly destroys more than we 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 'A''.') 

reap. A substitute, therefore, is desirable ; and if speltz, like: 
rye, escapes the ravages of that insect, it might be a good 
one. 1 did not recollect that it required a particular process 
for cleaning. As we have no mill here adapted to that 
purpose, it would be useless to introduce it. 

From your description of the rye sent to you from 
France, it appears far to exceed the kind we have. 1 wish 
that instead of dividing it. you had sowed the whole in your 
own ground, and distributed parcels <>t the increase. It is 
said that the quality of rye depends greatly on that of the 
soil. The prevailing opinion here is, that the rye of this 
country is all of one and the same species, and yet in some 
parts the rye bread is excellent, and in others black and 
strong. The weight and quality of the rye you mention 
lead me to suspect that it is of another species, or a distinct 
variety. I doubt there being danger of its depreciating, 
unless sown too near our own, or in particular cases of 
neglect. I know but of one kind of grain which, notwith- 
standing good management, depreciates here ; and that 
is oats. 

I am glad your second volume will soon be published. 
I expect to read it with pleasure, especially as there has 
been a hand in it which can make a " goose-quill" diffuse 
the " utile" and the " dulce" through many a page. I sup- 
pose a number will be printed for sale; if so, be so good 
as to desire the bookseller to send for me six sets. I mean 
to place a set in our town library, and to distribute others 
among certain persons in the neighbourhood, who, in my 
opinion, would make a proper use of them. 

Among the accounts you received from Doctor Logan, 
there are some which I did not expect, particularly those 
which respect the relative state of the manufactures and 
agriculture of England. In the present violent fluctuation 
of European affairs, it does not appear to me extraordinary 
that bullion should occasionally be scarce, and paper depre- 
ciate even in England. I suspect it to be merely occasional 



336 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

and transient, for I have heard of no adequate cause which 
could produce and continue to produce such effects. That 
nation, I am persuaded, wish to be and remain on friendly 
terms with us. I have some reason to believe that the idea 
of "dividing" is not a new one. If the micrometer is prac- 
tically accurate, the inventor has done more than I should 
have expected. 

Civil discord, it seems, is assigning to Spanish America 
a part in the prodigious tragedy now exhibiting on the the- 
atre of the world. We have seen and heard of strange 
things, and unless you should take your " French leave" 
before the curtain drops, you will doubtless see and hear of 
many more. I expect to take my leave more deliberately, 
but probably more early. Be that as it may, it is a com- 
fortable reflection, that when we do, hope will be the only 
article in Pandora's box that we shall take with us. Al- 
though a little more indisposed than I lately was, I am still 
much less unwell than I was at this time last year ; so that 
at present there is some prospect of my living to see further 
proofs of the perfectibility of human nature by modern 
philosophers, and of the increased illumination of this age 
of reason. 

Adieu, my dear sir. 

Yours, sincerely, 

John Jay. 

to judge peters. 

Bedford, 29th March, 1811. 
Dear Sir, 
I have received your letter of the 14th ult., and also the 
book on Plaster of Paris, which you was so obliging as to 
send me, and for which accept my thanks. 

Your letter conveyed to me the first and only informa- 
tion I have received, that a copy of President Washington's 
valedictory address had been found among the papers of 
General Hamilton, and in his handwriting; and that a cer- 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 337 

tain gentleman had also a copy of it in the same hand- 
writing. 

This intelligence is unpleasant and unexpected. Had 
the address been one of those official papers which, in the 
course of affairs, the secretary of the proper department 
might have prepared, and the president have signed, these 
facts would have been unimportant ; but it was a personal 
act — of choice, not of official duty — and it was so con- 
nected with other obvious considerations, as that he only 
could with propriety write it. In my opinion, President 
Washington must have been sensible of this propriety, and 
therefore strong evidence would be necessary to make me 
believe that he violated it. Whether he did or did not, is a 
question which naturally directs our attention to whatever 
affords presumptive evidence respecting it ; and leads the 
mind into a long train of correspondent reflections. I will 
give you a summary of those which have occurred to me ; 
not because I think them necessary to settle the point in 
question, for the sequel will show that they arc not, but 
because the occasion invites me to take the pleasure of re- 
viewing and bearing testimony to the merits of our departed 
friend. 

Is it to be presumed from these facts, that General Ham- 
ilton was the real, and the president only the reputed author 
of that address ? Although they countenance such a pre- 
sumption, yet I think its foundation will be found too slight 
and shallow to resist that strong and full stream of counter 
evidence, which flows from ,the conduct and character of 
that great man. A character not blown up into transient 
splendour by the breath of adulation, but, being compos< d 
of his great and memorable deeds, stands, and will forever 
stand, a glorious monument of human excellence 

So prone, however, is "poor human nature" to dislike 
and depreciate the superiority of contemporaries, that 
when these facts come to be generally known (and gener- 
ally known they will be) many, with affected regret and 

VOL. II. U U 



338 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

hesitation, will infer and hint, that Washington had less 
greatness of talent, and less greatness of mind, than his 
friends and admirers ascribed to him. Nor will the number 
of those be few, who, from personal or party inducements, 
will artfully encourage and diligently endeavour to give 
currency to such imputations. 

On the other hand, there are men of candour and judgment 
(and time will increase their number) who, aiming only at 
truth, will cheerfully trace and follow its footsteps, and on 
finding, gladly embrace it. Urged by this laudable mo- 
tive, they will attentively examine the history of his life ; 
and in it they will meet with such numerous proofs of his 
knowledge and experience of men and things in general, 
and of our national affairs in particular, as to silence all 
doubts of his ability to conceive and express every idea in 
that address. A careful perusal of that history will con- 
vince them, that the principles of policy which it recom- 
mends as rules for the conduct of others, are precisely those 
by which he regulated his own. 

There have been in the world but two systems or schools 
of policy ; the one founded on the great principles of wis- 
dom and rectitude, the other on cunning and its various 
artifices. To the first of these belonged Washington and 
all the other worthies of every country, who ascended to 
the temple of honour through the temple of virtue. The 
doctrines, maxims, and precepts of this school, have been 
explained and inculcated by the ablest writers, ancient and 
modern. In all civilized countries they are known, though 
often neglected ; and in free states have always been pub- 
licly commended and taught. They crossed the Atlantic 
with our forefathers ; and in our days particularly, have 
not only engaged the time and attention of students, but 
have been constantly and eloquently displayed by able men 
in our senates and assemblies. What reason can there be 
to suppose that Washington did not understand these sub- 
jects ? If it be asked, what these subjects comprehend or 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. '.V.V.) 

relate to ? the answer is this, They relate to the nature and 
duties of man — to his propensities and passions — his vir- 
tues and vices — his habits and prejudices — his real and 
relative wants and enjoyments — his capacities for social 
and national happiness — and the means by which, accord- 
ing to time, place, and other existing circumstances, it is, 
in a greater or less degree, to be procured, preserved, or 
increased. From a profound investigation of these sub- 
jects, enlightened by experience, result all that knowledge 
and those maxims and precepts of sound policy, which 
enable legislators and rulers to manage and govern public 
affairs wisely and justly. 

By what other means than the practical use of this know- 
ledge, could Washington have been able to lead and govern 
an army, hastily collected from various parts, and who 
brought with them to the field all the license and all the 
habits which they had indulged at home ? Could he, by 
the force of orders and proclamations, have constrained 
them to render him that obedience, confidence, and warm 
attachment which he soon acquired, and which, throughout 
all vicissitudes and distresses, continued constant and un- 
diminished to the last ? By what other means could he 
have been able to frustrate the designs of dark cabals, and 
the unceasing intrigues of envious competitors, and the arts 
of the opposing enemy ? By what other means could he 
have been able, in so masterly a manner, to meet and man- 
age all those perplexing embarrassments which the revo- 
lutionary substitution of a new government — which the 
want of that power in Congress which they had not, and 
of that promptitude which no deliberative body can have — 
which the frequent destitution, and constant uncertainty of 
essential supplies — which the incompetency of individuals, 
on whom much depended, the perfidy of others, and the 
mismanagement of many, could not fail to engender. 
We know, and history will inform posterity, that from the 
first of his military career, he had to meet and encounter, and 



340 MFE OF JOHN JAY. 

surmount a rapid succession of formidable difficulties, even 
down to the time when his country was enabled, by the 
success of their arms, to obtain the honourable peace which 
terminated the war. His high and appointed course being 
then finished, he disdained the intimations of lawless ambi- 
tion to prolong it. He disbanded the army under circum- 
stances which required no common degree of policy or vir- 
tue ; and with universal admiration and plaudits, descended 
joyfully and serenely into the shades of retirement. They 
who ascribe all this to the guidance and protection of Provi- 
dence, do well ; but let them recollect, that Providence 
seldom interposes in human affairs, but through the agency 
of human means. 

"When, at a subsequent and alarming period, the nation 
found that their affairs had gone into confusion, and that 
clouds, portending danger and distress, were rising over 
them from every quarter, they instituted under his auspices 
a more efficient government ; and unanimously committed 
the administration of it to him. Would thev have done 
this, without the highest confidence in his political talents 
and wisdom ? Certainly not. No novice in navigation 
was ever unanimously called upon to take the helm or 
command of a ship on the point of running aground 
anions: the breakers. This universal confidence would 
have proved a universal mistake, had it not been justified 
by the event. The unanimous opinion entertained and 
declared by a whole people in favour of any fellow-citizen, 
is rarely erroneous ; especially in times of alarm and 
calamity. 

To delineate the course, and enumerate the measures 
which he took to arrive at success, would be to write a 
volume. The firmness and policy with winch he overcame 
the obstacles placed in his way by the derangement of 
national affairs ; by the devices of domestic demagogues, 
and of foreign agents ; as well as by the deleterious influ- 
ences of the French revolution, need not be particularized. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 341 

Our records, and histories, and memoirs render it unnt 
sary. It is sufficient to say, and it can be said with truth, 
that his administration raised the nation out of confusion 
into order; out of degradation and distress into repu- 
tation and prosperity. It found us withering — it left us 
flourishing. 

Is it to he believed, that after having thus led the nation 
out of a bewildered state, and guided them for many years 
from one degree of prosperity to another, he was not quali- 
fied, on retiring, to advise them how to proceed and go on? 
And what but this is the object and the burden of his vale- 
dictory address ? He was persuaded that, as the national 
welfare had been recovered and established, so it could only 
be preserved and prolonged by a continued and steady ad- 
herence to those principles of sound policy, and impartial 
justice, which had invariably directed his administration. 
Although the knowledge of them had been spread and scat- 
tered among the people, here a little, and there a little, yet, 
being desirous to mark even the last day of his public life by 
some act of public utility, he addressed and presented them 
to his fellow-citizens, in points of light so clear and strong, 
as to make deep impression on the public mind. These 
last parental admonitions of this father of his country were 
gratefully received, and universally admired. But the ex- 
perience of ages informs us, that it is less difficult to give 
good advice, than to prevail on men to follow it. 

Such and so obvious is the force of the preceding con- 
siderations, as to render doubts of the president's ability to 
give the advice contained in the address too absurd to have 
many serious advocates. But it would not surprise me, if 
certain classical gentlemen, associating the facts you men- 
tion with the style and fashion of the address, should inti- 
mate, that his ability to compose it substantially in his 
mind, does not prove that he was also capable of commu- 
nicating his advice in a paper so well written. 



.342 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

Let those gentlemen recollect the classical maxim which 
they learned at school : 

" Scribendi recte, sapere est et principium et fons." 

They may also be referred to another classical maxim, 
which teaches us, that they who well understand their sub- 
ject, will be at no loss for words : 

" Verbaque provisam rem non invita sequentur." 

But his ability to write well need not be proved by the 
application of maxims ; it is established by facts. We are 
told to judge of a tree by its fruit ; let us, in like manner, 
judge of his pen by its performances. 

Few men, who had so little leisure, have written so 
much. His public letters alone are voluminous ; and pub- 
lic opinion has done justice to their merits ; many of them 
have been published, and they who read them will be con- 
vinced, that at the period of the address, he had not to 
learn how to write well. But it may be remarked, that 
the address is higher finished than the letters ; and so it 
ought to be. That address was to be presented to the 
whole nation, and on no common occasion : it w T as intended 
for the present and future generations ; it was to be read 
in this country, and in foreign countries ; and to be criti- 
cised, not only by affectionate friends and impartial judges, 
but also bv envious and malignant enemies. It was an 
address which, according as it should or should not corre- 
spond with his exalted character and fame, would either 
justify or impeach the prevailing opinion of his talents and 
wisdom. Who, therefore, can wonder that he should be- 
stow more thought, and time, and pains on that address 
than on a letter ? 

Although in the habit of depending ultimately on his 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 313 

own judgment, yet no man was more solicitous to obtain 
and collect light on every question and measure on which 
he had to decide. He knew that authors, like parents, are 
not among the first to discover imperfections in their 
offspring; and that consideration would naturally induce 
him to imitate the example of those ancient and modern 
writers (among whom were statesmen, generals, and even 
men of consular and royal dignity) who submitted their 
compositions to the judgment of their friends, before they 
put the last hand to them. Those friends would make 
notes of whatever defects they observed in the draught, 
and of the correspondent amendments which they deemed 
proper. If they found that the arrangement could be im- 
proved, they would advise certain transpositions ; if the 
connexion between any of the relative parts was obscure, 
they would make it more apparent; if a conclusion had 
better be left to implication than expressed, they would 
strike it out, and so vice versa; if an additional remark 
or allusion would give force or light to a sentiment or 
proposition, they would propose it ; where a sentence was 
too long, they would divide it; they would correct redun- 
dances ; change words less apt, for words more apt, &c, 
&c, &c. To correct a composition in this way, is to do 
a friendly office ; but to prepare a new one, and offer it to 
the author as a substitute for his own, would deserve a dif- 
ferent appellation. 

Among those to whose judgment and candour President 
Washington would commit such an interesting and delicate 
task, where is the man to be found, who would have had 
the hardihood to say to him in substance, though in terms 
ever so nice and courtly — Sir, I have examined and con- 
sidered your draught of an address : it will not do ; it is 
really good for nothing. But, sir, I have taken the trouble 
to write a proper one for you ; and I now make you a 
present of it : I advise you to adopt it, and to pass it on the 
world as your own; the cheat will never be discovered, 



344 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

for you may depend on my secrecy. Sir, I have inserted 
in it a paragraph that will give the public a good opinion 
of your modesty : I will read it to you ; it is in these 
words : 

" In the discharge of this trust, I will only say, that I 
have, with good intentions, contributed towards the organi- 
zation and administration of the government, the best ex- 
ertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. 
Not unconscious, in the outset, of the inferiority of my 
qualifications, experience in my own eyes, perhaps still 
more in the eyes of others, has strengthened the motives to 
diffidence of myself." 

If it be possible to find a man among those whom he 
esteemed, capable of offering to him such a present, it is 
impossible to believe that President Washington was the 
man to whom such a present would have been acceptable. 
They who knew President Washington, and his various 
endowments, qualifications, and virtues, know that, aggre- 
gately considered, they found a " tout ensemble" which has 
rarely been equalled, and perhaps never excelled. 

Thus much for presumptive evidence. I will now turn 
your attention to some that is direct. 

The history (if it may be so called) of the address is not 
unknown to me ; but as I came to the knowledge of it 
under implied confidence, I doubted, when I first received 
your letter, whether I ought to disclose it. On more 
mature reflection, I became convinced, that if President 
Washington was now alive, and informed of the facts in 
question, he would not only authorize, but also desire me 
to reduce it to writing ; that when necessary, it might 
be used to invalidate the imputations to which those facts 
give colour. This consideration terminated my doubts. I 
do not think that a disclosure is necessary at this moment, 
but I fear such a moment will arrive. Whether I shall

then be alive, or in capacity to give testimony, is so uncer- 
tain, that in order to avoid the risk of either, I shall now 
reduce it to writing, and commit it to vour care and dis- 
cretion, " de bene esse," as the lawyers say. 

Some time before the address appeared, Colonel (after- 
ward General) Hamilton informed me, that he had received 
a letter from President Washington, and with it the draught 
of a farewell address, which the president had prepared. 
and on which he requested our opinion. He then proposed 
that we should fix on a day for an interview at my house 
on the subject. A day was accordingly appointed. On 
that day Colonel Hamilton attended. He observed to me, 
in words to this effect — that, after having read and ex- 
amined the draught, it appeared to him to be suscepuble of 
improvement — that he thought the easiest and best way 
was to leave the draught untouched and in its fail state; 
and to write the whole over with such amendments, altera- 
tions, and corrections as he thought were advisable; and 
that he had done so. He then proposed to read it, and to 
make it the subject of our consideration. This being agreed 
to, he read it ; and we proceeded deliberately to discuss 
and consider it, paragraph by paragraph, until the whole 
met with our mutual approbation : some amendments were 
made during the interview, but none of much importance. 
Although this business had not been hastily despatched, yet, 
aware of the consequence of such a paper, I suggested the 
giving it a further critical examination ; but he declined it, 
saying that he was pressed for time, and was anxious to 
return the draught to the president without delay. It 
afterward occurred to me, that a certain proposition was 
expressed in terms too general and unqualified, and I hinted 
it in a letter to the president. 

As the business took the course above mentioned, a re- 
currence to the draught was unnecessary, and it was not 
read. There was this advantage in the course pursued — 
the president's draught remained (as delicacy required)

fair, and not obscured by interlineations, &c. By com- 
paring it with the paper sent with it, he would immediately 
observe the particular emendations and corrections that 
were proposed ; and would find them standing in their in- 
tended places. Hence he was enabled to review and to 
decide on the whole matter, with much greater clearness 
and facility than if he had received them in separate and 
detached notes, and with detailed references to the pages 
and lines, where they were advised to be introduced.

Sin, 

Accept my thanks for the book on the Resources of Great 
Britain, which you was so obliging as to send me. It 
abounds in interesting matter, and if the facts and calcula- 
tions stated in it are correct, there appears to be reason to 
conclude that Britain has less danger to apprehend from a 
long-continued war, than from a premature peace. 

In the twelfth page there is an anecdote which seems to 
refer to me : if it does, it is proper for me to observe that 
your information on that head is not entirely accurate. 
While in France I was neither present at the death, nor at 
the funeral of any French philosopher. During my resi- 
dence there, I do not recollect to have had more than two 
conversations with atheists about their tenets. The first 
was this : I was at a large party, of which were several of 
that description. They spoke freely and contemptuously 
of religion. I took no part in the conversation. In the 
course of it, one of them asked me if I believed in Christ ? 
I answered that I did, and that I thanked God that I did. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. '.] 1 7 

Nothing further passed between me and them or any of 
them on that subject. 

Some time afterward, one of my family being danger- 
ously ill, I was advised to send for an English physician, 
who had resided many years at Paris. He was said to be 
very skilful, but, it was added, he is an atheist. I sent 
him, and had reason to think highly of his skill. For 
several weeks the patient required numerous visits, so that 
I saw the doctor often. He was a sedate, decent man. I 
frequently observed him drawing the conversation towards 
religion, and I constantly gave it another direction. He 
nevertheless, during one of his visits, very abruptly re- 
marked, that there was no God, and he hoped the time 
would come when there would be no religion in the world. 
I very concisely remarked, that if there was no God, there 
could be no moral obligations, and 1 did not see how society 
could subsist without them. He did not hesitate to admit, 
that if there was no God, there could be no moral obliga- 
tions, but insisted that they were not necessary, for that 
society would find a substitute for them in enlightened self- 
interest. I soon turned the conversation to another topic, 
and he probably perceiving that his sentiments met with a 
cold reception, did not afterward resume the subject.

Dear Sir, 
On the 4th inst. your letter of the 23d of last month was 
delivered to me. It gave us all pleasure to find from it 
that you and your family were then well. If all the pro- 
ductions of your farm are as fine as tiie sample of one 
kind of them, which you sent me, you have much reason to 
praise it. 



348 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

You have certainly had no inconsiderable share of diffi- 
culties, dangers, and troubles, and as you justly observe, 
Providence has carried you through them all, and has also 
given you consolations and enjoyments. Such is more or 
less the lot of all men. If, my good friend, there were no 
trials in this world, it would not be what it certainly is, a 
state of probation ; some are tried by adversity, some by 
prosperity, and many by both. If in our journey through 
life, we were to meet with nothing but what was pleasant, 
we should probably be too little mindful of home, and too 
little disposed to take a rough road to it, even though it 
should be the most direct one. We have neither of us 
much further to travel. If, on our arrival, we find it a 
paradise, our enjoyments will not be diminished by the 
recollection that we had suffered much on the way. 

I still flatter myself with the expectation of again seeing 
you here, especially as your health is good, and your busi- 
ness would be attended to during your absence. We should 
have new affairs as well as old affairs to talk over. Those 
among the new ones, which concern the welfare of yourself 
and family, will be particularly interesting to 

Your friend,

TO PETER JAY ML>RO. 

Bedford, 2d March, 1812. 

Dear. Peter, 

It is said that the manufacturing company at Mamaro- 
neck have applied to the Legislature for an act to empower 
them (on paying damages) to overflow and drown as much 
of the adjacent farms, and without the consent of the own- 
ers, as may be necessary to make a pond that will afford a 
more ample supply of water than they can otherwise obtain 
there. The country abounds in plentiful streams. Why 
did they not fix on one that would answer their purpose ? 

When a piece of ground is wanted for a use important 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 349 

to the State, I know that the State has a right to take it 
from the owner, on paying the full value of it ; but certainly 
the Legislature has no right to compel a freeholder to part 
with his land to any of his fellow-citizens, nor to deprive 
him of the use of it, in order to accommodate one or more 
of his neighbours in the prosecution of their particular trade 
or business. Such an act. by violating the rights of prop- 
erty, would be a most dangerous precedent. 

The injury which the pond would doubtless cause to the 
health of the neighbourhood deserves attention ; but inter- 
esting as it is, I think it of less importance than that of 
exposing, by such an act, the rights of property to invasion 
and disturbance. It may be said that the pond, by facili- 
tating manufactures, will be productive of good to the 
public ; but will it not produce more loss than gain, if any 
of the essential rights of freemen are to be sunk in it. 

If the company want any thing belonging to their neigh- 
bours, let them, like all other individuals, obtain it by volun- 
tary, and not by compelled purchase. It would be strange 
if the Legislature appointed to guard our equal rights, 
should be prevailed upon to furnish means for such com- 
pulsion. 

These remarks are made on the supposition that what 1 
have heard may possibly be true ; but to me it appears so 
extraordinary, that I am inclined to suspect that it has not 
been fully and fairly represented. Be so good as to inform 
me, what the application made by the company to the Legis- 
lature really is. 

I am, dear Peter, 

Your affectionate uncle, 

John J a v.

TO RICHARD BLAND LEE, ALEXANDRIA. 

Bedford, 7th September, 1812. 

Sir, 

In your obliging answer to my letter of February last, 
mention is made of a work of your brother, then in the 
press, viz. " Memoirs of the War in the Southern Depart- 
ment." The subject and the author naturally excited my 
attention, and my desire to procure a copy. 

I have not learned that it has yet been published, nor 
seen any thing relative to it in our public papers. I pre- 
sume, therefore, that the work is still in the press. If it is 
printing by subscription. I wish that my name may be on 
the list of subscribers, and that I may use my endeavours to 
increase the number of them. Be pleased, therefore, to 
inform me on this head. 

The outrages committed at Baltimore excited the greater 
indignation, on account of the characters of some of the suf- 
ferers, and particularly your brother, whose claims to public 
gratitude have so long and so justly been acknowledged 
throughout the United States. Let me request the favour 
of you to assure him that I rejoice in the prospect of his 
recovery ; and in the hope that on the occurrence of proper 
occasions, our country will again derive advantage and 
honour from his talents and patriotism. 

With sentiments of esteem and regard, I am, sir, 

Your obedient servant, 

John Jay.

Bedford, 2d Dec, 1812. 

Rev. Sir, 

I received by the last mail your letter of the 19th Sep- 
tember, containing a copy of " An act to incorporate the 
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions," 
and an abstract from their minutes, purporting, that at a 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. .'J51 

meeting of the board in September last, I had been elected 
a member of it. 

Such institutions become the religion we profess, and the 
blessings we enjoy. Be pleased to assure the board that I 
am very sensible of the honour they have done me; and 
that I wish it was as much in my power, as it is in my 
inclination, to attend their meetings and take an active part 
in the business committed to them. For several years my 
health has been declining, and my age, as well as the nature 
of my complaints, do not permit me to expect the restora- 
tion of it. 

Reflecting that they who consent to accept a place or 
office do impliedly engage to perform the duties of it, I 
think it right to declare my inability to perform those in 
question. If, therefore, any active services should be ex- 
pected from me, I hope and request that the board will 
consider themselves at liberty to give to this declaration 
, the effect of a resignation, and proceed to elect another in 
my stead. 

I am, reverend sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

John Jay.

Bedford, 1st January, 1813. 

Dear Sir, 

Accept my thanks for your friendly letter of the 17th ult., 
and for the sermon and report which accompnnnd it. 

Whether our religion permits Christians to vote for infi- 
del rulers, is a question which merits more consideration 
than it seems yet to have generally received, either from 
the clergy or the laity. It appears to me, that what the 
prophet said to Jehoshaphat about his attachment to Ahab,* 
affords a salutary lesson on another interesting topic. 

* " Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord V 
— 2 Chron. xix. 2. 



352 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

Although the mere expediency of public measures may 
not be a proper subject for the pulpit, yet, in my opinion, it 
is the right and the duty of our pastors to press the ob 
servance of all moral and religious duties, and to animad- 
vert on every course of conduct which may be repugnant 
to them. 

The Rev. Mr. Chapin informed me, that the American 
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions had done me 
the honour to elect me one of the members of it, and has 
also been so obliging as to send me copies of their last 
report. Institutions like this are not only to be approved 
and commended, but also to be sustained and assisted. As 
the declining state of my health will not permit me to ren- 
der any active service, I feared that by retaining a place at 
the board, I should exclude some other person who would 
be more useful. My answer, therefore, to Mr. Chapin 
referred it to the board to do therein as they may judge 
proper. 

The amount of the subscriptions exceed what I had sup- 
posed, and manifests a spirit which I hope will become more 
universal. 

Permit me to request the favour of you to procure for 
me two complete sets of the Panoplist,* and to put my 
name on the list of subscribers for two of each of the future 
numbers. I purpose to place one set of them in our town 
library : some good may result from it. 

Such is your knowledge and information relative to the 
United States and their affairs, that I regret your finding 
it inconvenient to undertake the history you allude to. 
That it will be written at some future day is probable ; but 
when, or how well performed, is uncertain. Time will not 
wait, but will proceed in its usual way to impair memory, 
to diminish and obscure evidence, to introduce doubt, and 
enable error to impose on credulity, and acquire credit from 

' A religious Magazine. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 353 

currency. I presume, therefore, that a history (except as 
to great outlines) is the less to be depended upon, as its date 
is remote from the period of the transactions which it under- 
takes to narrate. How few have the talents, the patient 
diligence, and the love of truth which history requires. 

The aspect of the times certainly continues portentous. 
To hope for the best and prepare for the worst, is a trite 
but a good maxim ; especially when associated with the 
reflection that He who governs the world can restrain the 
wrath of man as well as the rage of the ocean. It is a 
favourable circumstance, that the delusion which, like an 
epidemic, has prevailed throughout our country, is abating 
in many of the States. Calamities sometimes afford good 
remedies for national distempers. 

My retirement has not disappointed me. As to my 
health, a complaint in the liver has for several years been 
impairing it. Medical prescriptions failing to remove it, 
relief could only be sought from palliatives; and among 
these I find temperance, patience, and resignation to be the 
best. 

I am glad, for her sake and for yours, that Mrs. Morse 
enjoys good health. I hope you do also. That you may 
both live to see many happy returns of this day, is very sin- 
cerely the wish of

Many considerations would make it agreeable to me to 
attend the meeting of the board at Boston. I have here- 
tofore found and enjoyed excellent society in that city, and 
although I should feel the absence of several worthy per- 
sons, who have removed to the " city not made with hands," 
yet others remain whom it would give me pleasure to 
meet. 

Notwithstanding the inducements I have to make frequent 
visits to New-York, I have not been there for four years 
past. The state of my health, and the regimen it requires, 
not permitting me to be far or long from home. 

It is certainly desirable that those of our fellow-citizens 
who are friendly to foreign missions, should contribute to 
repair the loss of the mission printing-office at Serampore. 
It appears from a late paper that measures for that purpose 
were taking at New- York, and there is reason to hope 
and expect, that the aggregate amount of the collections 
will be considerable. 

The mode of remitting it to India is of some importance. 
To me it appears advisable that all American missionary 
measures should, as far as circumstances may admit, be 
connected with the American Board for Foreign Missions. 
I therefore think, that the money in question should be 
remitted to India accordingly. If we were at peace with 
England, I should prefer having it remitted, by the board, 
to the missionary society there, and through them to India. 
Mutual confidence and good-will between societies instituted 
for the same purpose, and actuated by similar motives of 
benevolence, should be cultivated. 

Having for some days past been less well than usual, I 
find myself constrained to be more concise than I intended 
when I began this letter. 

With sentiments of esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 

Your obedient servant, 

John Jay.

My dear Friend, 
Last Tuesday evening my wife was delivered of a boy. 
I communicate that event because I believe it will give you 
pleasure. Moreover, I wish you to be one of his godfathers. 
True it is, thai according to the usual course, you may not 
be able to perform the duties of that office ; but, my friend* 
should you be mingled with the dust, he shall learn from the 
history of your life, that a man must be truly pious to be 
truly great. I do not fix the day, because I wish you 
to come on in a fortnight or three weeks, when it best suits 
your convenience. I will then summon the priest and the 
other sponsors. 

Yours truly, 

GOUVERNEUR MoRRIS. 

TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Bedford, 22d February, 1813. 

My good Friend, 

I thank you for informing me by your letter of the 15th 
inst. that you had received " an heritage and gift," which 
doubtless filled your heart with joy and gratitude. 

It would give me pleasure to present in person to you 
and Mrs. Morris my gratulations on the occasion ; but since 
the winter began, I have not been abroad, and this confine- 
ment will, as usual, continue until warm weather. I hope 
Mrs. Morris and the " spes altera" are doing well, and that 
the emotions they excite are not interrupted by gout or 
anxiety. 

You request me to be one of the godfathers. Baptism 
is too generally regarded as being little more than a cus- 
tomary ceremony ; and yet the purpose of it, and the names 
used on the occasion, show it to be a solemn procedure. 
It confers privileges, and imposes obligations of the highest

class. Whoever consents to be employed as a shepherd, 
should recollect, that if a lamb be lost by his negligence, he 
must answer for it to the owner of the flock. Sponsors, 
however, not unfrequently become such, with as little sense 
of personal responsibility, as actors on the stage make the 
engagements, &c, allotted to their parts. 

Had I the prospect of residing here many years, I should 
feel no reluctance, for I should find in my heart and mind 
sufficient inducements to fulfil the duties in question, in case 
they should eventually be incumbent on me. But as I ex- 
pect to remove, at a more early period, to a distant country, 
where I shall not be in a capacity to attend to persons or 
things here, it appears to me advisable that some proper 
person not so circumstanced should be selected. 

It is an agreeable circumstance that you will probably, 
continue at Morrisania for many years, and have time and 
health to prepare the young gentleman to make a figure 
there, as w T ell as at the more valuable habitation and 
estate, which will, in his baptism, be offered to him by his 
Sovereign. 

That you and he may, here and ever, be happy in and

Rev. Sir, 

I received on Saturday last the interesting letter which 
you did me the favour to write on the 31st ult, together 
with the two pamphlets which you was so obliging as to 
send with it. 

Marks of respect to the characters of such men as Dr. 
Elliot, not only tend to console their afflicted relatives, but 
also to cherish the virtues by which they were distinguished. 
"Unhappily, there is too much reason for the common

remark, that obituary commendations by anonymous writers 
are so frequently misapplied as to be worth very little. 
The sermon (as was proper) describes the Dr.'s character 
in general terms, but the testimony which it bears to his 
merit is ample, clear, and decided ; and considering from 
whom it comes, leaves no room for doubt or scruple 

As the intruded memoir, to contain a more detailed ac- 
count of Dr. Elliot, is to be published in the next volume of 
Historical Collections, and consequently under the auspices 
of the society, it will be appreciated by that circumstance, 
and doubtless have also the advantage of being written in 
a manner worthy of the subject, and of such respectable 
patrons. This will be bestowing merited praise in a hand- 
some manner. Not a few of the name, and I presume of 
the same family, of Elliot, have in this country laboured 
faithfully in promoting the best interests of man. Their 
services will be remembered in heaven, and ought not to 
be forgotten on earth. I feel for the Dr.'s family. Death 
daily severs many tender ties . . . but not for ever. 

I thank you very sincerely for your kind offers of ser- 
vice, and with pleasure reciprocate them. They prompt 
me to request the favour of you to send me the 1st volume 
of the new series, as well as the 10th volume, mentioned in 
my letter to Dr. Elliot.

The circumstances mentioned in it cannot be regarded 
with indifference by those who wish you well ; and I feel as 
well as think so. 



358 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

It is not improbable, that doubts prevail respecting the 
design and tendency of the work you have in hand. The 
literary productions of Britain and America being interest- 
ing to each other, many are of opinion, and I concur in it, 
that the English language and its orthography should be 
the same in both countries. Apprehensions have been en- 
tertained that your dictionary would tend to impair that 
sameness ; and those apprehensions may, to a certain de- 
gree, have had an unfavourable influence. 

The progress of the subscription having been so long 
suspended, I think it better to enclose what I intended to 
subscribe, than trouble your agents at New- York with it. 

If any plan to render your prospects more promising, 
and in my power to promote, should be adopted, be pleased 
to communicate it to me. 

I am, sir, 

Your obedient servant,

Amherst, June 9th, 1813 

Sir, 

For your favour of the 31st ult. with the enclosed bill, 
be pleased to accept my most grateful acknowledgments. 
The interest you have manifested in my labours, and the 
liberality accompanying it, are the more acceptable, as they 
have been unsolicited. 

It is not improbable that some ill-founded apprehensions 
that I might attempt changes of orthography, have had their 
effect in preventing subscriptions ; but there are several 
other causes. 

On the subject of orthography, gentlemen might have 
been easy, as any considerable changes must prevent the 
sale and use of a work of this sort, and they might ration- 
ally conclude that I would not put myself to an immense 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 359 

trouble and expense, to write a book which would not find 
purchasers. 

My plan is different from any thing before attempted. I 
have examined and collated the radical words in twenty 
languages, including the seven Asiatic languages, or rather 
dialects of the Assyrian stock. This will enable me to 
explain many things in the English language which have 
hitherto been obscure. Indeed, this research has opened a 
field entirely new, and it is probable will lead to many 
important discoveries, not only in the origin and affinity of 
languages, but in history sacred and profane. 

The price of the work cannot be known at present ; but 
if I live to complete it, I shall not only present you a copy, 
but hold myself answ r erable to refund the principal of the 
sum advanced. 

With gratitude and respect, I am sir, 

Your obedient servant,

Bedford, 25th October, 1813. 
Dear Sir, 
I have chosen for this letter a subject that is more within 
your province than in mine. " Quisque sua arte peritus." 

The 29th verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st Corinthians 
is deemed to be an obscure one. I understand it in a sense 
which satisfies me, but I find that the few commentators 
whom I have consulted, understand it in other senses. I 
will subjoin the verse, and explain what I conceive to be 
the meaning of it, in a short paraphrase. Tell me what 
you think of it. When you see Mr. Evarts, be pleased to 
present my best compliments to him. 

I am, dear sir, 
Your faithful and obedient servant,

360 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

1 Cor. xv. 29. — " Else what shall they do who have been 
baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all 1 why are 
they then baptized for the dead ?" 

The apostle doubtless intended to include in this verse, 
an argument to support the doctrine he was endeavouring 
to establish. That sense of it, therefore, is probably the 
true one, which gives the most strength and fitness to the 
argument. 

His meaning will perhaps be more perceptible, if certain 
parts of the verse be transposed, as follows : 

Else what shall they do, who, if the dead rise not at all, 
have been baptized for the dead. Why are they then bap- 
tized for the dead 1 

As thus read, the converse of the proposition is plainly 
this, viz. That they are not baptized for the dead, if the 
dead are to rise : but that they are baptized for the dead, 
if the dead are not to rise. 

So that the question, whether they are baptized for the 
dead or not, depends on the answer to the question, whether 
the dead are to rise or not. 

PARAPHRASE. 

But Christ is risen, and he will certainly raise our dead 
bodies from the grave. If it were not so, what are believers, 
who, in a confident hope and expectation, and as an assurance 
of a resurrection, have been baptized, and thereby become 
professed disciples and followers of Christ, to do ? 

Baptism initiated them into his covenant and promise to 
revive and reunite their bodies with their souls after death, 
and bless them with everlasting life and happiness in & future 
state. If there is to be no such revival, no such reunion, 
no such future state, their baptism, and faith, and hopes in 
the gospel are vain and nugatory. What are they to do ? 
What can they do ? 

They who were baptized into Christ were baptized into 
his death ; they were buried with him by baptism into death ;

they were planted together into the likeness of his death. 
And why ? Certainly for assurance that they should also 
be planted into the likeness of his resurrection. Divest 
baptism of its reference to a resurrection, and it will have 
no other remaining reference but the one to death and the 
dead. 

//"the dead rise not at all (as some among you say), then, 
and in that case, and on that supposition, all without excep- 
tion who have been baptized, are in fact baptized for the 
dead, that is, for their own dead bodies, for their dust and 
ashes; for that is the only future state in which they will 
be and remain for ever. Why, or for what reason, or for 
what purpose then, or in that case, arc they baptized for 
their dead bodies — dead and never to rise again ? What 
effect can baptism, or promises, or covenants operate on, or 
for them, after they have passed into a state of utter and 
never-ending insensibility ? Is it for such a future state, 
that our bodies are baptized with water, and our souls with 
the Holy Ghost ? 

You know that I preach and declare to the Jews, and to 
the gentiles, that Christ is risen, and that he will raise the 
dead. Unless I was sincere in this, would I persist in 
preaching it at the risk of my life every hour ? 

If the dead are never to rise, what advantage or reward 
can I expect or receive, for the persecutions and sufferings 
which I willingly incur and endure, on account of my 
avowed and zealous adherence to Christ ? Did I believe 
that this was the only world in which I am to exist, would 
I not endeavour to find and enjoy all the good and all the 
gratifications which this world affords I It is natural for 
those who neither expect good nor evil beyond the grave, 
to say, "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die." 
Nothing can be more manifest than that, if in this world 
only we have hope in Christ, we, his persecuted apostles 
and followers, are of all men most miserable.

3G2 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

Be not deceived into doubts of a resurrection. You 
were not baptized for eternal sleep, but for endless life after 
death, and your baptism is a pledge to assure you of it. If 
you reject one of the assurances, or declarations, or promises 
of Christ as fallacious, how are you to rely on the rest ? 
Listen not to such teachers, lest their evil examples and 
communications seduce you into opinions and practices 
repugnant to the principles, institutions, and manners which 
are established and enjoined by the gospel. 

TO WILLIAM MILLER. 

Bedford, September 20th, 1814. 

Dear Sir, 

Since my last letter to you, I have received yours of the 
10th of last month. 

The information that you and your family were then in 
good health; gives us pleasure. I continue feeble, but do 
not suffer much pain, except now and then from rheuma- 
tism. The rest of us are as well as usual. 

The cold weather you mention has also prevailed here. 
I do not recollect so cool a summer. Our corn does not 
look well. The crops of rye were slender ; those of wheat 
were good. 

As to public affairs, I do not wonder that you look for- 
ward to the consequences of the war with anxiety. We 
are told that " wherewithal a man sinneth, by the same also 
shall he be punished," and this doubtless is applicable to 
nations as well as to individuals. He who governs all 
nations, sometimes corrects national misrule by making it 
instrumental to national chastisement ; we have been un- 
grateful. 

You and I are far advanced in our journey through life. 
We have in the course of it sometimes found the weather, 
the roads, and the accommodations agreeable ; at other 
times we have found them unpleasant, and occasionally

distressing ; and so, my good friend, it will be to the end. 
Let us comfort ourselves with the reflection, that although 
we must expect to meet with troubles of one kind or other 
on the way, yet that they cannot prevent our getting home. 
On the contrary, they tend to excite our diligence and to 
quicken our pace. That we may both be enabled to keep 
in the right road to our home, is the wish and prayer of, 

Dear sir, 

Your friend, 

John Jay. 

from timothy pickering.* 

City of Washington, Oct. 22d, 1814. 

Dear Sir, 

I have done myself the honour to make up three packets 
addressed to you, this day, containing the despatches from 
our ministers from Ghent, their instructions, and the state- 
ment of the new secretary of the treasury of his plan of 
taxes, and his project of a national bank. 

While the proposition respecting an Indian boundary was 
declared to be a sine qua non, the boundary itself admitted 
of modification ; and as within it, we are called upon to 
relinquish only our right of pre-emption to the Indians, who 
are proprietors of 'the soil, I see no objection to it. With- 
out such demand, good polio/ would require such relin- 
quishment, to prevent encroachments on the Indians, and 
thereby the renewal of hostilities ; and the dispersion of 
our citizens over immense regions, defensible only at an 
insupportable expense, while we have so many millions of 
acres of good lands remaining without inhabitants. 

I am disposed to believe that with less pride in rulers 
and ministers, and with less hatred to Great Britain in both, 
the British propositions might have been made the basis of 
a negotiation which, governed by wisdom and prudence,

and esteem,

to timothy tickering. 

Bedford, 1st Nov., 1814. 

Dear Sir, 

Accept my thanks for your letter of the 22d ult., and for 
the papers which you was so good as to send; they 
arrived by the last mail. 

It is to be regretted, that passions unfavourable to mutual 
good-will have for years been industriously and unwisely 
excited both in Great Britain and America. An inveterate 
delusion has long prevailed in our country ; Providence 
has made it a scourge for our chastisement, and we well 
deserve it. 

Every independent nation has, as such, a rightful and 
exclusive jurisdiction over the country within its acknow- 
ledged boundary lines. For either nation to propose to the 
other a system of measures for the security and comfort of 
the Indians, dwelling within their contiguous and respective 
territories, or for other mutual good purposes, can neither 
be offensive nor improper ; but to dictate such propositions, 
and to tell us that we must accede to them as the price of 
peace/Ms to assume language rarely used, unless by the 
victorious to the vanquished. 

It is not clear to me, that Britain did then expect or 
desire to conclude the war quite so soon. As to her pres- 
ent or future disposition to peace, or how far it has been or 
may be affected by a settled or by a still fluctuating state 
of things in Europe, or by calculations of our becoming 
more united or more divided, cannot now be known. If 
we should change our rulers, and fill their places with men 
free from blame, the restoration of peace might doubtless 
be more easily accomplished. Such a change will come, 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 365 

but not while the prevailing popular delusion continues to 
deceive and mislead so great a portion of our citizens. 

Things being as they are, I think we cannot be too per- 
fectly united in a determination to defend our country ; 
nor be too vigilant in watching and resolutely examining 
the conduct of the administration in all its departments, 
candidly and openly giving decided approbation or decided 
censure, according as it may deserve the one or the other. 
Report says, that in the public expenditures there has been 
great culpability. It is desirable, therefore, that they be 
thoroughly investigated, and that the results be authen- 
ticated in such a manner as to obviate doubt and disbelief. 

I have just read Mr. King's speech. They who com- 
plain that it exhibits too little of the " suaviter in modo" 
cannot also complain that it exhibits too little of the " for- 
titer in re." 

With constant esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 

Your obedient servant, 

Jon* Jay. 

TO JUDGE TETERS, ESQ. 

Bedford, 9th January, 1815. 

Dear Sir, 

It is a great while since any letters have passed between 
us ; perhaps some of them have miscarried. The season 
reminds me that I have survived the last year, and that I 
have left with it a great number who enjoyed more health 
and strength. Many friendly wishes have, as usual, been 
reciprocated on this occasion, but it seems to be question- 
able whether an average proportion of them will be real- 
ized. Public adversity, you know, is at variance with 
individual happiness ; and it has not yet become very 
probable that this will be a happy year to our country. I 
should rejoice to find myself mistaken, but I cannot be per- 
suaded that general prosperity will be restored while our 



3GG LIFE OP JOHN JAY. 

nation continues to be misled by the delusions which 
caused, and which prolong our calamities. We have not 
only declared war unwisely, but have also unwisely 
(though not unwittingly) excited disgust and resentment. 
How far angry passions will retard the return of peace 
may be conjectured, rather than calculated. We are yet 
to learn whether the result of the negotiations at Vienna 
will impede or promote those at Ghent. While the former 
are pending, I suspect that Britain will not be anxious to 
obviate delays. To me, personally, these things cannot 
long be very interesting, but I feel for those whom I shall 
leave behind me. You are in the way of knowing more 
about our national affairs than I am, and I sincerely wish 
that your views of them may be more consoling than mine 
are. 

My health continues to wear away, but I seldom suffer 
severe pain. Conversation, books, and recollections still 
enable me, with the blessing of Providence, to amuse con- 
finement, and to glide on placidly towards that ocean to 
which the stream of time is bearing us all. 

Tell me how you do. With constant esteem and regard, 

I am, dear sir, 

Your very humble servant, 

John Jay. 

from judge peters. 

Belmont, Jan. 19th, 1815. 

My dear Sir, 

Your very welcome letter of the 9th inst. I received 
at the moment I was contemplating sending to you our 
third volume of Agricultural Memoirs, as a small token of 
remembrance. I shall, by the first opportunity, have it for- 
warded to you. A few of us endeavour to keep this sub- 
ject alive amid the din of. arms, which are ever hostile to 
the arts of peace and their attendant blessings. Too much 
of this effort falls on me ; but yet some relief from surround- 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 3G7 

ing glooms is found in attention to topics which abstract 
the mind from the vices and follies plentifully scattered 
throughout our devoted country. Mortification under what 
we arc, is at least for the moment suspended, while we con- 
template on what we have been. It may return with double 
force, when we consider what we might have been. 

But it seems that history affords ample proofs, and ours 
as much as any other, that " this world was made for 
ir." The enjoyment of liberty is fugacious ; but des- 
potism, under a variety of shapes, is permanent. There is 
a tendency to it in all human political institutions ; and the 
people of every country have, from time immemorial, forged 
their own chains. Our " free and enlightened" citizens are 
now very busy at the anvil ; but whether their work will 
now be completed, is not for us to decide. Heaven may 
send us chastisement without ruin, and possibly the former 
may save us for a time. Delusion is the order of the day. 
Gordon, in one of his discourses on Tacitus, endeavours to 
prove that the people, when deceived by dehulers, are blind 
and cruel, yet mean well. Too many of our people are 
blind, yet few cruel ; as to their meaning well, they take a 
lamentable mode of showing it. 

Your letter contains an epitome of my thoughts on our 
political situation. Had I written a book (and I have no 
adversary who would think it worth his while to wish that 
I had), I could not express myself more clearly on the sub- 
ject. At our age we are lookers-on, and see the game 
better than those who play it. The insight which calm 
observation and experience afford is, however, of no use to 
those who deem themselves too wise to need instruction. 
We must wait events, like passengers in a bark buffeted 
by storms, and mismanaged by unskilful pilots and mariners. 
I hope our vessel is yet stanch, and that she will get into 
port, whatever untoward appearances may predict. It is 
indeed distressing when hope alone is our comforter. But, 



368 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

alas ! all I know is far from furnishing light or brilliancy to 
the threatening and dusky cloud which overhangs our 
hemisphere. 

Our president is not the man we once supposed him. 
Party antipathies may possibly paint in too sombre colours; 
but the stories I hear are distressing, particularly to me, 
who in early times had a sincei^e personal friendship for him. 
He would then take some strange flights : one of them was 
his joining in the philippic against you, for not consulting 
the French minister (Vergennes), when the interest of your 
country forbade the step. But, in general, I thought and 
acted with him. In this matter, far otherwise ; nor have 
I, in his modern conduct, been in union with his political 
sentiments on any important subject, although I entertain 
no personal enmity. 

I have a strong impression that we shall, ere long, have 
peace ; but the why and the wherefore I cannot tell, save 
that there seems nothing really substantial enough in the 
litigated affairs of the two nations, to continue the business 
of throat-cutting ; and I fancy our enemy is tired of the 
employment, after following the trade so long. 

I am gratified with the account of your travelling on 
towards the goal we all must arrive at, with a mind tran- 
quil, and a body without pain. Your companions — books 
and recollections — are consolatory and essential, when all 
others have lost their relish. 

I thank you for your kind inquiries about my health. I 
have but lately recovered from a most unfortunate acci- 
dent, having been thrown on the stones of our turnpike 
from my horse, who took fright and ran away with me. 
He was a Kentucky racer (a quality I did not know), and 
no doubt took his revenge for his countrymen, by chastis- 
ing me for my bad politics. I had three trenched gashes 
in my pericranium ; yet I escaped becoming crack-brained, 
which may be reckoned uncivil, as it is fashionable nowa-

to judge peters. 

Bedford, Westchester County, ) 
11th March, 1815. > 

Dear Sir, 

On reading your interesting letter of the 19th January, 
I observed, with particular pleasure, from the manner and 
matter of it, that, notwithstanding the winter of life, and 
snow falling on your head, you endure like an evergreen. 

Your impression that " we should, ere long, have peace" 
has been verified. If I remember right, you had hereto- 
fore an impression that Spain, although her case was ap- 
parently desperate, would get safe through her danger ; 
and so it came to pass. Events having justified both these 
impressions or opinions, I wish you may have another, viz. 
that the peace will terminate the delusion which caused the 
war. Several considerations incline me to expect that the 
peace will diminish it, and particularly these : 

Unless discontents should arise between France and 
Britain, French influence will not soon be very active in 
America ; and, consequently, will not administer much fuel 
to renew and feed a flame against England. The peace 
will deprive the delusion of the sustenance it derived from 
the patronage which the war create I. 

The abandonment of the professed objects of the war, 
and that without compensation either in fact or expecta- 
tion — the manifest incapacity and profusion with which the 
war has been conducted — the attempts to force supplies of 
men and money by conscription, &c. — and the immense 
debt incurred and to be paid, without any value received — 
all tend to withdraw confidence and good-will from our 
political projectors ; nor can the continuance and operation 

VOL. II. A A A 



370 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

of war-taxes be congenial with the feelings of a people who, 
if pagans, would dedicate more temples to Plutus than to 
Minerva. 

These, and the like facts and considerations, will doubt- 
less have the most weight with that portion of the commu- 
nity who have been misled, but who really mean well. 
They will probably have some effect also on the more con- 
siderate of the others. As to the position, that " the people 
always mean well," or, in other words, that they always 
mean to say and to do what they believe to be right and 
just, — it may be popular, but it cannot be true. The word 
])coj)lc, you know, applies to all the individual inhabitants 
of a country, collectively considered. That portion of 
them who individually mean well, never was, nor until the 
millennium will be, considerable. We have not heard of 
any country, in which the great mass of the inhabitants 
individually and habitually adhere to the dictates of 
their consciences. We know how well demagogues and 
pharisaical patriots mean. Having much of the wisdom of 
this world, and little of that of the other, they will, like 
their great predecessor Absalom, always mean and act 
accordingly. 

Besides, Providence sometimes chastises nations with 
physical epidemics, and sometimes (by " choosing their 
delusions") with moral epidemics, and after a while removes 
them. This encourages hope ; for if we have arrived at 
or near the pessimum of this evil, the melius cannot be far 
distant. 

Accept my thanks for the book you was so kind as to 
send me. I have found some good things in it, and shall 
doubtless find more. Many of our citizens, who are more 
than mere farmers, have of late years improved our agri- 
culture. Would not a good American edition of Columella 
be acceptable to them ? It gratifies curiosity, by showing 
the state of agriculture at a remote period ; and, on several 
topics, affords information which will be useful at any period

Bedford, 14th Feb., 181*. 
Dear Sir, 

On the 4th inst. I received by the mail from New- York 
your interesting letter of the 17th ult. I have read the 
pamphlets communicated to me by Mr. Grant, and derived 
from them the only knowledge I have of the transactions 
noticed in them. It would not be easy to introduce into 
my mind doubts of your rectitude. My opinion of it has 
undergone no alterations. You are drawing consolation 
from a source which always affords it. 

As to the work you mention, I am glad you have under- 
taken it, because it is desirable, and because I expect it will 
be well performed. It would give me pleasure to afford 
the aids you request, but the state of my health admits of 
very little exertion of mind or body. I can neither read 
nor write much at a time, without bringing on a feverish 
weariness. 

My public life did not commence so early as you sup- 
posed. In 1766, 1 was a clerk in a lawyer's office, and on 
leaving it was occupied in professional affairs until the year 
1774, when I was sent to the first Congress. In 1775, I 
was also in Congress ; in 1776, the Convention of this State 
detained me with them. In 1778 I was again sent to Con- 
gress, and remained there until September, 1779, when I 
was sent to Europe. In 1784 I returned home. 



372 LIFE OP JOHN JAY. 

From this statement, you will perceive that my know- 
ledge of the important events which occurred before the 
year 1774 cannot be particular. 

The difficulty of collecting materials, and of ascertaining 
their real value, will increase with time. There are very 
few of the well-informed official men of those days now 
alive, and the few who remain will in a few years more be 
gone. To you I need not remark that many things have 
been written and said which are not correct. The collec- 
tion of materials (if nothing to perfect it be left undone), 
will cost much time, trouble and expense. Some informa- 
tion may be acquired by letters, but much more and much 
better may be obtained by personal inspections, applications, 
and interviews. 

Valuable materials exist in the office of the secretary of 
state, in the public and private journals of Congress, and 
among the papers of the several States, &c. 

You know my sentiments respecting history, — festina 
lente. No good history has been, nor can be produced in 
haste. 

I regret the impediments which deprived me of the pleas- 
ure of the visit you intended. I hope some favourable op- 
portunity of making it will yet occur, and that Mrs. Morse 
may come with you. We will then converse on these 
topics, and I will readily communicate to you such mate- 
rials among those I possess, as you may deem interesting. 

Be so obliging as to assure Mr. and Mrs. Evarts of my 
best wishes for the health and prosperity of themselves and 
their family. I am glad thqj| little boy is doing well. May 
he long continue to do so in every respect. 

I am, dear sir, 

Yours, very sincerely, 

John Jay.

I have made some progress in reading it. The principle I

Had all uninspired expositors been content with the sim-

Rev. Sir, 

Your letter of the 1st inst. informing me that I had been

Society, arrived by the last mail. 

I rejoice in the institution of that national society, and 
assure the Board of Managers, that I am very sensible of the 
honour they have done me, in thus connecting me with it. 

The events and circumstances under which such socie- 
ties have been established and multiplied, in my opinion, in- 
dicate an origin, which makes it the duty of all Christians to 
unite in giving them decided patronage and zealous support. 

I have the honour to be, with respect and esteem,

Bedford, Westchester County, N. Y. } 
8th August, 1816. 

Dear Sir, 

I have received the papers which you were so obliging as 
to send me. Accept my thanks for them. Gratitude is 
due to those who employ their time and talents in promoting 
the common welfare. Your exertions to improve agricul- 
ture, and render it more productive, are known and ac- 
knowledged. The paper on " mildew in wheat," I have 
sent to New- York to be published. The multitude of 
interesting facts which have been collected during the last 
twenty years, doubtless furnish materials for a comprehen- 
sive system of husbandry ; such a work, ably executed, 
would be useful. 

Credit is also due to your endeavours to make known 
and excite attention to the means which conduce to health 
and longevity. The proposed edition of the code on these 
subjects, in one octavo volume, will be better calculated for 
general use and extensive circulation, than the larger work 
from which it is to be extracted. I hope it will soon be 
finished and find its way to this country. It must be an 
agreeable reflection to you, that you have been "diligent in 
well-doing." 

My health has for years been declining, and my age 
reminds me that the re-establishment of it is not to be ex- 
pected. What you have written of the flesh-brush will 
induce me to use it more frequently. It can do no harm 
and may do good, and that is no inconsiderable recom- 
mendation. 

With the best wishes that your health and longevity 
may be such as to give additional weight to your remarks 
respecting them, 

I am, dear sir, 

Your faithful and obedient servant, 

John Jay. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 375 



TO JOHN MURRAY, JIN. 

Bedford, 12th October, 1816. 

Accept, my good friend, my thanks for your kind letter 
of the 22d ult., and for the pamphlets enclosed with it. 
They came to my hands on the 2d inst. The state of my 
health is such, that I can read or write but little at a time 
without fatigue ; and, therefore, I cannot prudently venture 
on the task you recommend. 

Whether war of every description is prohibited by the 
gospel, is one of those questions on which the excitement of 
any of the passions can produce no light. An answer to it 
can result only from careful investigation and fair reasoning. 

It appears to me that the gospel not only recognises the 
whole moral law, and extends and perfects our knowledge 
of it, but also enjoins on all mankind the observance of it. 
Being ordained by a legislator of infinite wisdom and rec- 
titude, and in whom there is "no variableness," it must be 
free from imperfection, and therefore never has, nor ever 
will require amendment or alteration. Hence I conclude, 
that the moral law is exactly the same now that it w 7 as be- 
fore the flood. 

That all those wars and fightings are unlawful, w r hich 
proceed from culpable desires and designs (or in Scripture 
language from lusts), on the one side or on the other, is too 
clear to require proof. As to w r ars of an opposite descrip- 
tion, and many such there have been, I believe they are as 
lawful to the unoffending party in our days, as they were 
in the days of Abraham. He waged war against and 
defeated the five kings. He piously dedica ted a tenth of the 
spoils ; and, instead of being blamed, was blessed. 

What should we think of a human legislator who should 
authorize or encourage infractions of his own laws? If 
wars of every kind and description are prohibited by the 
moral law, I see no way of reconciling such a prohibi- 
tion with those parts of Scripture which record institu- 



376 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

tions, declarations, and interpositions of the Almighty which 
manifestly evince the contrary ? If every war is sinful, how 
did it happen that the sin of waging any war is not specified 
among the numerous sins and offences which are mentioned 
and reproved in both the Testaments? 

To collect and arrange the many facts and arguments 
which relate to this subject, would require more time and 
application than I am able to bestow. The aforegoing are 
hinted merely to exhibit some of the reasons on which my 
opinion rests. 

It certainly is very desirable that a pacific disposition 
should prevail among all nations. The most effectual way 
of producing it, is by extending the prevalence and influence 
of the gospel. Real Christians will abstain from violating 
the rights of others, and therefore will not provoke war. 

Almost all nations have peace or war at the will and 
pleasure of rulers whom they do not elect, and who are not 
always wise or virtuous. Providence has given to our 
people the choice of their rulers, and it is the duty, as well 
as the privilege and interest, of our Christian nation to select 
and prefer Christians for their rulers. 

The sentiment expressed in the extract from your 
brothers letter, corresponds with his benevolent disposition. 
He has been " diligent in well-doing," and his works will 
not cease to receive, as well as deserve commendation. 
When you write to him, assure him of my esteem and 
regard. 

I thank you for the kind wishes expressed in the conclu- 
sion of your letter. They refer to topics on which I have 
been accustomed to meditate, and are far more important 
than any which belong to this transient scene. 

With the best wishes for your welfare, in the most 
enlarged sense, 

I remain, your obliged friend, 

John Jay.

TO GOTTVERNEUR MORRIS. 

: Oct., 181R. 

Dear Morris, 

Having heard much of your discourse before the New- 
York Historical Society, it gave me pleasure to r< ■• 
copy of it, and to find from the direction that I owed it to 
your friendly attention. Itaboundsin interesting remarks ; 
the diction is elevated throughout, perhaps in some in- 
stances beyond the proportion which the topics bear to each 
other. In landscape, we prefer bill and dale to a plain, 
however ornamented : and in a field of eloquence it is agree- 
able to behold sublimities slopii 'j down into Attic sim- 
plicity. I doubt the correctness of saying that Franklin 
averted thunderbolts from protect d dwellings. In my opin- 
ion, the invention of steamboats is a subject on which it is 
less difficult to say handsome, than sublime things. To 
me it does not appear probable, that the sight of them on 
Asiatic waters can so powerfully affect the feelings of the 
Genius of Asia, as to impel him to bow with grateful 
reverence (not gratulation) to the inventive spirit of Amer- 
ica ; and that, too, at the very moment when his eve, fflancine 
over the ruins of cities, which for ages had concurred in 
proclaiming his superiority in the arts, must remind him of 
his dignity. I make no apology tor these hints ; you know 
what prompts them. 

Your strictures on the defects of history, and the causes 
of them, are well founded. Whether future historians, with 
all their advantages, will excel their predecessors in accu- 
racy, and caution, and candour, is ;i point on which my ex- 
pectations are not sanguine. For my port, 1 believe there 
neither is, nor will be, more than one history free from error. 
Of that history the discourse has availed itself very in- 
geniously, deducing from it lessons instructive to all, and 
new to many. I have often wished that the accounts given 
in it of the primitive ages had been more particular. We

know but little about them, and our curiosity must remain 
ungratified while we remain here. I say here, because when 
we join our ancestors, we shall doubtless learn from them 
all that we may wish to know respecting the affairs and 
events of their days. In this and other respects I promise 
myself much satisfaction from their society ; and that at 
a period which cannot be very distant. The term of my 
lease has expired, and I have no reason to expect that my 
continuing to hold over will be of more than ordinary du- 
ration. It is consoling to reflect that we tenants are informed 
where and how we may go and settle in perpetuity, and are 
assured that our possessions and enjoyments there, instead 
of being precarious and transitory, will be certain and per- 
manent. 

That you and I, and those who are near and dear to us, 
may be enabled to say with the poet, but in a higher and 
better sense, "omnes metus, strepitumque Acherontis avari 
subjecit pedibus," is the fervent wish of your affectionate 
friend, 

John Jay. 

I hope our little boy advances in strength, and growth of 
body and mind. 

FROM JOHN ADAMS. 

Quincy, Jan. 9th, 1819. 
Dear Sir, 

Sketches of the Life and Character of Patrick Henry, by 
William Wirt, of Richmond, Virginia, has been sent to 
me by Mr. Shaw, of the Athenaeum. My family are read- 
ing it to me every evening, and though we have not finished 
it, we have proceeded far enough to excite an earnest de- 
sire to know your opinion of it. 

There is in section fourth, page 108, a passage which no 
man now living but yourself can explain. I hope you have 
read the volume ; but as it is possible you may not have 
seen it, the paragraph is this : 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 379 

" A petition to thu king, an address to the people of 
Great Britain, and a memorial to the people of British 
America, were agreed to be drawn. Mr. Lee, Mr. Henry, 
and others were appointed for the first ; Mr. Lee, Mr. 
Livingston, and Mr. Jay for the two last. The splendour 
of their debut occasioned Mr. Henry to be designated by 
his committee to draw the petition to the king, with which 
they were charged, and Mr. Lee was charged with the 
address to the people of England. The last was first re- 
ported. On reading it, great disappointment was expressed 
in every countenance, and a dead silence ensued for some 
minutes. At length it was laid on the tabic for perusal and 
consideration till the next day ; when first one member 
and then another arose, and paying some faint compliment, 
to the composition, observed that there were still certain 
considerations not expressed, which should properly find a 
place in it. The address was therefore committed for 
amendment; and one prepared by Mr. Jay, and nil; red 
by Governor Livingston, was reported ami adopted with 
scarcely an alteration. These facts were stated by a gen- 
tleman, to whom they were communicated by Mr, Pendle- 
ton and Mr. Harrison, of the Virginia delegation (except 
that Mr. Harrison erroneously ascribed the draught to 
Governor Livingston), and to whom they were afterward 
confirmed by Governor Livingston himself. Mr. Henry's 
draught of a petition to the king was equally unsuccessful, 
and was recommitted for amendment. Mr. John Dickin- 
son (the author of the Farmers Letters) was added to the 
committee, and a new draught prepared by him was 
adopted." 

This passage is not so luminous as many parts of the 
book; but as I understand it, I think it is not correct. 
There is no man now living who is able perfectly to cor- 
rect it but yourself; and in my opinion, it is your conscien- 
tious duty to do it. 



380 LIFE OF JOHN JAY, 

The question, " Who was the draughtsman of the address 
to the people of England ?" however unimportant to the 
public it may appear at this day, certainly excited a sensa- 
tion, a fermentation, and a schism in Congress at the time, 
and serious consequences afterward, which have lasted to 
this hour, and are not yet spended. I fear, bat I do not 
know, that this animosity was occasioned by indiscretions 
of R. II. Lee, Mr. Samuel Adams, and some others of the 
Virginia delegates, by whom Adams was led into error. I 
never had a doubt that you were the author of that manly 
and noble address. But as the subject is now brought 
before the public by Mr. Wirt, and will excite speculation, 
you, who alone are capable of it, ought to explain it, and, as 
I know you will, if at all, without favour or affection. 
I am, sir, with friendship as of old, 

Your most respectful humble servant, 

John Adams. 

to john adams. 

Bedford, 31st January, 1818. 
Dear Sir, 

I received your letter of the 9th by the mail which 
arrived here on the 24th inst. 

1 have not seen Mr. Wirt's book, nor heard of the " pas- 
sage" in it, of which your letter contains a copy. You 
think that passage, as you understand it, is not correct, and 
observe, that as I am the only man remaining alive who 
can perfectly correct it, " in your opinion it is my consci- 
entious duty to do it." 

For your satisfaction, and pursuant to your opinion, I 
will proceed to give you a plain statement of facts. There 
are entries in the printed journals of Congress of 1774 which 
merit attention ; and I think the extracts from that journal, 
which I shall introduce, afford in erences which militate 
against some of the incidents mentioned in the passage. 
That you may compare and examine both with the greater 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 38] 

ease to yourself, I will first insert the passage, and then the 
extracts. 

"A petition to the king, an address to the people of Great 
Britain, and a memorial to the people of British America 
were agreed to be drawn. Mr. Lee, Mr. Henry, and 
others were appointed for the first ; Mr. Lee, Mr. Living- 
ston, and Mr. Jay for the two last. The splendour of their 
debut occasioned Mr. Henry to be designated by his com- 
mittee to draw the petition to the king with which they 
were charged, and Mr. Lee was charged with the address 
to the people of England. The last was firs' reported. 
On reading it, great disappointment \\ as expressed on every 
countenance, and a dead silence ensued for some minutes. 
At length it was laid on the table for perusal and considera- 
tion till the next clay ; when first one member, and then 
another arose, and, paying some faint compliment to the 
composition, observed that there were still certain consider- 
ations not expressed which should properly find a place in 
it. His address was therefore committed for amendment ; 
and one prepared by Mr. Jay, and oiVered by Governor 
Livingston, was reported and adopted with scarcely an 
alteration. These facts are stated by a gentleman, to whom 
they were communicated by Mr. Pendleton and Mr. Har- 
rison of the Virginia delegation (except that Mr. Harrison 
erroneously ascribed the draught to Governor Livingston), 
and to whom they were afterward confirmed by Governor 
Livingston himself. Mr. Henry's draft of a petition to the 
king was equally unsuccessful, and was recommitted for 
amendment. Mr. John Dickinson (the author of the farm- 
er's Letters) was added to the committee, ami a new 
draught prepared by him was adopted." 

"Tuesday, October lltk, 1774. — Resolved unanimously;

invariable observation of the measures recommended by 
the Congress, as thev tender the invaluable rights and lib- 
erties derived to them from the laws and constitution of 
their country. 

" Also, that an address be prepared to the people of 
Great Britain. 

" Ordered, That Mr. Lee, Mr. Livingston, and Mr. Jay 
be a committee to prepare a draught of the memorial and 
address." 

The committee assigned the memorial, which was first 
in order, and also deemed first in importance, to Mr. Lee. 
Mr. Livingston, who was my superior both in age and 
reputation, was desired to prepare the address. He de- 
clined it, and urged me to take it. I finally consented, and 
did write it. 

" Tuesday, October l&th, 1774. — The committee appointed 
to prepare the address to the people of Great Britain brought 
in a draught, which was read and ordered to lie on the table 
for the perusal of the members, and to be taken into con- 
sideration to-morrow. 

" Wednesday, October 19th, 1774. — The Congress re- 
sumed the consideration of the address to the people of 
Great Britain ; and the same being debated by paragraphs, 
and sundry amendments made, the same was recommitted, 
in order that the amendments may be taken in." 

I was present in Congress, and attended to the proposed 
amendments. Mr. Lee (one of the committee) moved that 
the draught should be recommitted for the purpose men- 
tioned in the journal ; and for that purpose it was recom- 
mitted. The amendments were made the next day, and 
the draught was returned to Congress the ensuing morning. 

" Friday, October 21st, 1774. — The address to the people 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 

of Great Britain being brought in, and the amendments 
directed being made, the same was approved, and is as fol- 
lows." 

Is it probable that the committee found il sary to 

assign both the memorial and the address to Mr. Lee, or 
that he would readily undertake that double task, or that 
notwithstanding his other avocations in and out of Con- 
gress, he could finish them both between the 11th October, 
when they were ordered, and the 19th, when the drai 
of the memorial was reported ? 

According to the journal, the draught of the address was 
recommitted, expressly for the purpose, and "in order that 
the amendments might be taken in." Is it probable that the 
committee did, nevertheless, lay aside that draught and 
substitute a new one ? How could they have rendered such 
a procedure reconcilable to the feelings of the writer of that 
draught, or compatible with their recent approbation of it, 
or consistent with the design and object of the recommit- 
ment ? Could any of the members have been so negligent 
of delicacy and propriety, as to propose or concur in such 
a measure ? Could the embarrassments and difficulties 
attending it have been surmounted between the Wednes- 
day, when the address was recommitted, and the ensuing 
Friday, when (with the amendments taken in) it was read 
and approved ? 

The subsequent occurrences you mention have not 
escaped my recollection. I was informed, and I believe 
correctly, that one person in particular of those you specify, 
had endeavoured, by oblique intimations, to insinuate a sus- 
picion that the address to the people of Great Britain was 
not written by me, but by Cov. Livingston. That gentle- 
man repelled the insinuation. He knew and felt what was 
due to truth, and explicitly declared it. 

Those persons are dead and gone. Their design did not 
succeed, and I have no desire that the memory of it should

survive them. As to the address or petition to the king — 
who wrote the draught that was reported and recommitted 
— how far it corresponded with the one that was adopted — 
whether Mr. Dickinson, after he was added to the com- 
mittee, prepared an entire new draught, or only co-operated 
in amending the one then before the committee — are ques- 
tions which you only, who have survived all the other 
members of that committee, can answer with certainty. 

Considering who were the members of that committee, 
viz. yourself, Mr. Lee, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Henry, and Mr. 
Rutlcdge, I think the idea of a new draught cannot be cor- 
rect. That*Mr. Dickinson did write the subsequent or 
second address or petition to the king, I have no reason to 
doubt. 

To prepare an acceptable draught of the first petition 
was no easy task. Instructions as to matters to be inserted 
in it were given to the committee : and some were pro- 
posed which occasioned much debate. You may remember 
that many of the m< mbers of that Congress were anxious 
that too much might not be done or said ; and on the other 
hand, that there were many members who were anxious 
that too little might not be done or said. Hence there 
arose and prevailed a more than ordinary degree of solici- 
tude and watchfulness, both as to the purport of subject- 
matter, and to the force and latitude of expressions. And 
hence also it may have happened, that (except the draught 
of a letter to the agents in England) every report made to 
that Congress received amendments of one kind or other, 
before they approved and adopted it. 

Be pleased to present my best respects to Mrs. Adams. 
It gives me pleasure to reflect, that your friendship for me 
has from of " old"' continued steadfast, and that my estima- 
tion of it has constantly animated the attachment with which 
I have so long been, and am, dear sir, 

Your affectionate friend, 

John Jay. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 385 



TO JOHN MURRAY, JUN. 

Bedford, 15th April, 1818. 
My good Friend. 

In my letter to you of the 16th October Inst, I hinted that 
I might perhaps write and send you a few more lines on 
the question, Whether war of every description is forbidden 
by the gospel ? 

I will now add some remarks to those which were in- 
serted in my answer to your first letter. In that answer, 
the lawfulness of Mar, in certain cases, was inferred from 
those divine positive institutions which authorized and reg- 
ulated it. For although those institutions were not dictated 
by the moral law, yet they eannot be understood to author- 
ize what the moral law forbids. 

The moral or natural law was given by the Sovereign of 
the universe to all mankind ; with them it was coeval, and 
with them it will be coexistent. Being founded by infinite 
wisdom and goodness on essential right, which never varies, 
it can require no amendment nor alteration. 

Divine positive ordinances and institutions, on the other 
hand, being founded on expediency, which is not always 
perpetual or immutable, admit of, and have received, altera- 
tion and limitation in sundry instances. 

There were several divine positive ordinances and insti- 
tutions at very early periods. Some of them were of lim- 
ited obligation, as circumcision ; others of them were of 
universal obligation, as the Sabbath, marriage, sacrifices, 
the particular punishment for murder. 

The Lord of the Sabbath caused the day to be changed. 
The ordinances of Moses suffered the Israelites to exercise 
more than the original liberty allowed to marriage, but our 
Saviour repealed that indulgence. When sacrifices had 
answered their purpose as types of the greal Sacrifice, &c, 
they ceased. The punishment for murder has undergone 
no alteration, either by Moses or by Christ. 

VOL. II.— *C C C 



386 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

I advert to this distinction between the moral law and 
positive institutions, because it enables us to distinguish 
the reasonings which apply to the one, from those which 
apply only to the other — ordinances being mutable, but the 
moral law always the same. 

To this you observe, by way of objection, that the law 
was given by Moses, but that grace and truth came by 
Jesus Christ ; and hence that even as it relates to the moral 
law, a more perfect system is enjoined by the gospel than 
was required under the law ; which admitted of an eye for 
an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, tolerating a spirit of retali- 
ation. And further, that if the moral law was the same 
now that it was before the flood, we must call in question 
those precepts of the gospel which prohibit some things 
allowed of, and practised by the patriarchs. 

It is true that the law was given by Moses, not however 
in his individual or private capacity, but as the agent or 
instrument, and by the authority of the Almighty. The 
law demanded exact obedience, and proclaimed, " Cursed is 
every one that continueth not in all things which are writ- 
ten in the book of the law to do them." The law was 
inexorable, and by requiring perfect obedience, under a 
penalty so inevitable and dreadful, operated as a school- 
master to bring us to Christ for mercy. 

Mercy, and grace, and favour did come by Jesus Christ ; 
and also that truth which verified the promises and predic- 
tions concerning him, and which exposed and corrected the 
various errors which had been imbibed respecting the 
Supreme Being, his attributes, laws, and dispensations. 
Uninspired commentators have dishonoured the law, by 
ascribing to it, in certain cases, a sense and meaning which 
it did not authorize, and which our Saviour rejected and 
reproved. 

The inspired prophets, on the contrary, express the most 
exalted ideas of the law. They declare that the law of the 
Lord is perfect ; that the statutes of the Lord are right ; 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 387 

and that the commandment of the Lord is pure ; that God 
would magnify the law, and make it honourable, &zc. 

Our Saviour himself assures us, that he came not to de- 
stroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfil. That who 

shall do and teach the commandments, shall be called great 
in the kingdom of heaven : that it is easier for heaven and 
earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail. This cer- 
tainly amounts to a full approbation of it. Even after the 
resurrection of our Lord, and after the descent of the Holy 
Spirit, and after the miraculous conversion of Paul, and 
after the direct revelation of the Christian dispensation to 
him, he pronounced this memorable encomium on the law, 
viz : " The law is holy, and the commandments holy, just, 
and good" 

It is true that one of the positive ordinances of Moses, to 
which you allude, did ordain retaliation, or in other words, 
a tooth for a tooth. But we are to recollect that it was 
ordained, not as a rule to regulate the conduct of private 
individuals towards each other, but as a legal penalty or 
punishment for certain offences. Retaliation is also mani- 
fest in the punishment prescribed for murder — life for life. 
Legal punishments are adjudged and inflicted by the law 
and magistrate, and not by unauthorized individuals. These 
and all other positive laws or ordinances established by 
Divine direction, must of necessity be consistent with the 
moral law. It certainly was not the design of the law or 
ordinance in question, to encourage a spirit of personal or 
private revenge. On the contrary, there are express injunc- 
tions in the law of Moses, which inculcate a very different 
spirit; such as these: "Thou shalt not avenge, nor hear 
any grudge against the children of thy people ; but thou 
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." " Love the stran 
for ye were strangers in Egypt." "If thou meet thy 
enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring 
it back to him," &c. &c. 

There is reason to believe that Solomon understood the 



388 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

law in its true sense, and we have his opinion as to retalia- 
tion of injuries, viz : " Say not, I will recompense evil ; but 
wait upon the Lord, and he will save thee." Again, " Say 
not, I will do to him as he hath done to me. I will render 
to the man according to his work." And again, " If thine 
enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat ; and if he be 
thirsty, give him water to drink ; for thou shall heap coals 
of fire upon his head, and the Lord shall reward thee." 

But a greater than Solomon has removed all doubts on 
this point. On being asked by a Jewish lawyer, which was 
the great commandment in the law, our Saviour answered, 
" Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and 
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first 
and the great commandment, and the second is like unto it ; 
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two 
commandments hang all the law and the prophets." It is 
manifest, therefore, that the love of God and the love of 
man are enjoined by the law ; and as the genuine love of 
the one comprehends that of the other, the apostle assures 
us that " Love is the fulfilling of the law" 

It is, nevertheless, certain, that erroneous opinions re- 
specting retaliation, and who were to be regarded as neigh- 
bours, had long prevailed, and that our Saviour blamed and 
corrected those and many other unfounded doctrines. 

That the patriarchs sometimes violated the moral law, is 
a position not to be disputed. They were men, and subject 
to the frailties of our fallen nature. But I do not know nor 
believe, that any of them violated the moral law by the 
authority or with the approbation of the Almighty. I can 
find no instance of it in the Bible. Nor do I know of any 
action done according to the moral law, that is censured or 
forbidden by the gospel. On the contrary, it appears to 
me that the gospel strongly enforces the whole moral law, 
and clears it from the vain traditions and absurd comments 
which had obscured and misapplied certain parts of it. 

As, therefore, Divine ordinances did authorize just war — 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 389 

as those ordinances were necessarily consistent with the 
moral law, and as the moral law is incorporated in the 
Christian dispensation, I think it follows, that the right to 
W&gejust and necessary war is admitted, and not abolished 
by the gospel. 

You seem to doubt whether there ever was a just war, 
and that it would puzzle even Solomon to find one. 

Had such a doubt been proposed to Solomon, an answer 
to it would probably have been suggested to him by a very 
memorable and interesting war which occurred in his day. 
I allude to the war in which his brother Absalom on the 
one side, and his father David on the other, were the bel- 
ligerent parties. That war was caused by, and proceeded 
from " the lusts" of Absalom, and was horribly wicked. 
But the war waged against him by David, was not caused 
by, nor did proceed from " the lusts" of David, but was 
right, just, and necessary. Had David submitted to be 
dethroned by his detestable son, he would, in my opinion, 
have violated his moral duty and betrayed his official trust. 

Although just war is not forbidden by the gospel in ex- 
press terms, yet you think an implied prohibition of all war, 
without exception, is deducible from the answer of our Lord 
to Pilate, viz : " If my kingdom were of this world, then 
would my servants fight," &c. 

At the conclusion of the last supper, our Lord said to his 
disciples, " He that hath no sword, let him now sell his gar- 
ment and buy one." They answered, " Lord, here are two 
swords." He replied, " It is enough." 

It is not to be presumed that our Lord would have 
ordered swords to be provided, but for some purpose for 
which a sword was requisite, nor that he would have been 
satisfied with two, if more had been necessary. 

Whatever may have been the purposes for which swords 
were ordered, it is certain that the use of one of those 
swords soon caused an event, which confirmed the subse- 
quent defence of our Lord before Pilate, and also produced 



890 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

other important results. When the officers and their band 
arrived, with swords and with staves, to take Jesus, they 
who were about him saw what would follow. " They said 
unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword ?" It does 
not appear that any of the eleven disciples who were with 
him, except one, made the least attempt to defend him. 
But Peter, probably inferring from the order for swords, 
that they were now to be used, proceeded to " smite a ser- 
vant of the high-priest, and cut off his right ear." Jesus 
(perhaps, among other reasons, to abate inducements to 
prosecute Peter for that violent attack) healed the ear. 

He ordered Peter to put his sword into its sheath, and 
gave him two reasons for it. The first related to himself, 
and amounted to this, that he would make no opposition, 
saying, " The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I 
not drink ?" The second related to Peter, viz. they who 
take the sword, shall perish by the sword ; doubtless 
meaning that they who take and use a sword, as Peter had 
just done, without lawful authority, and against lawful 
authority, incur the penalty and risk of perishing by the 
sword. This meaning seems to be attached to those words 
by the occasion and circumstances which prompted them. 
If understood in their unlimited latitude, they would con- 
tradict the experience and testimony of all ages, it being 
manifest that many military men die peaceably in their 
beds. 

The disciples did believe and expect that Jesus had 
come to establish a temporal kingdom. " They trusted 
that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel." 
" They knew not the Scripture, that he must rise again 
from the dead ; questioning one with another what the 
rising from the dead should mean." Even after his resur- 
rection, they appear to have entertained the same belief 
and expectation ; for on the very day he ascended, they 
asked him, " Lord, wilt thou at this time restore the king- 
dom to Israel V 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 391 

The order for swords, and the declaration that two were 
enough, tended to confirm that belief and expectation, and 
to inspire a confidence that he who had commanded the 
winds and the waves, and had raised the dead to life, was 
able, as well as willing, to render the two swords sufficient 
to vanquish his enemies. Could any thing less than such a 
firm belief and confidence have prompted eleven such men, 
and with only two swords among them, to offer to "smite 
with the sword" the armed band, which under officers ap- 
pointed by the Jewish rulers, had come to apprehend their 
master \ 

Great must have been the disappointment and astonish- 
ment of the disciples, when Jesus unexpectedly and peace- 
ably submitted to the power and malice of his enemies, 
directing Peter to sheath his sword, and hinting to him the 
danger he had incurred by drawing it: amazed and terri- 
fied, they forsook him and lied. This catastrophe so sur- 
prised, and subdued the intrepidity of Peter, as that he was 
no longer " ready to go with his master to prison and to 
death." 

It seems that perplexity, consternation, and tumultuous 
feelings overwhelmed his faith and reflection, and that his 
agitations receiving fresh excitement from the danger and 
dread of discovery, which soon after ensued, impelled him 
with heedless precipitation to deny his Master. This de- 
nial proved bitter to Peter, and it taught him and others that 
spiritual strength can be sustained only by the spiritual 
bread which cometh down from heaven. 

The Jews accused Jesus before Pilate of aspiring to the 
temporal sovereignty of their nation, in violation of the 
regal rights of Caesar. Jesus, in his defence, admitted that 
he was King, but declared that his kingdom was not of this 
world. For the truth of this assertion, he appealed to the 
peaceable behaviour of his adherents, saying, "If my king- 
dom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I 



392 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

should not be delivered to the Jews, but now is my kingdom 
not from hence." 

Pilate, who doubtless well knew what had been the con- 
duct of Jesus, both before and at the time of his appre- 
hension, was satisfied, but the Jews were not. They ex- 
claimed, " If thou let this man go, thou art not Cassar's 
friend ; whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against 
Caesar." " We have no king but Caesar." 

You and I understand the words in question very differ- 
ently. Is there the least reason to infer from the belief and 
conduct of the disciples, that they were restrained from 
fighting by the consideration that their Master's kingdom 
was not of this world ? On the contrary, did they not be- 
lieve and expect that he had come to restore one of the 
kingdoms of this world to Israel ? The fact is, that they 
were ready and willing to fight. Did they not ask him, 
" Lord, shall we smite with the sword V It was his will, 
therefore, and not their will, which restrained them from 
fighting ; and for that restraint he assigned a very con- 
clusive reason, viz. because his kingdom was not of this 
world. 

To the advancement and support of his spiritual sove- 
reignty over his spiritual kingdom, soldiers and swords, 
and corporeal exertions were inapplicable and useless. 
But, on the other hand, soldiers and swords, and corporeal 
exertions are necessary to enable the several temporal 
rulers of the states and kingdoms of this world, to maintain 
their authority and protect themselves and their people ; 
and our Saviour expressly declared, that if his kingdom 
had been of this world, then would his servants fight to 
protect him ; or in other words, that then and in that case, 
he would not have restrained them from fighting. The 
lawfulness bf such fighting, therefore, instead of being 
denied, is admitted and confirmed by that declaration. 

This exposition coincides with the answer given by John 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 393 

the Baptist (who was " filled with the Holy Ghost") to the 
soldiers who asked him what they should do, viz. " Do 
violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely, and be con- 
tent with your wages." Can these words be rationally un- 
derstood as meaning thai they should receive wages for 
nothingl Or, that when ordered to march against the 
enemy, they should refuse to proceed ; or that, on meeting 
the enemy, they should either run away, or passively sub- 
mit to be captured or slaughtered ' This would be attach- 
ing a meaning to his answer very foreign to the sense of 
the words in which he expressed it. 

Had the gospel regarded war as being in every case sin- 
ful, it seems strange that the apostle Paul should have been 
so unguarded, as in teaching the importance of faith, to 
use an argument which clearly proves the lawfulness of 
war, viz. " That it was through faith that Gideon, David, 
and others waxed valiant in fight, and turned to flight the 
armies of aliens ;" thereby confirming the declaration of 
David, that it was God who had "girded him with strength 
to battle ; and had taught his hands to war, and his fingers 
to fight." 

The gospel appears to me to consider the servants of 
Christ as having two capacities or characters, with corre- 
spondent duties to sustain and fulfil. 

Being subjects of his spiritual kingdom, they are bound 
in that capacity to fight pursuant to his orders, with spirit- 
ual weapons, against his and their spiritual enemies. 

Being also subjects, and partakers in the rights and in- 
terests of a temporal or worldly state or kingdom, they are 
in that capacity bound, whenever lawfully required, to fight 
with weapons in just and necessary war,against the worldly 
enemies of that state or kingdom. 

Another view may be taken of the subject. The de- 
pravity which mankind inherited from their first parents, 
introduced wickedness into the world. That wickedness 
rendered human government necessary to restrain the vio- 

VOL. II. D D n 



394 life or joiin jay. 

lencc and injustice resulting from it. To facilitate the 
establishment and administration of government, the human 
race became, in the course of Providence, divided into 
separate and distinct nations. Every nation instituted a 
government, with authority and power to protect it against 
domestic and foreign aggressions. Each government pro- 
vided for the internal peace and security of the nation, by 
laws for punishing their offending subjects. The law of all 
the nations prescribed the conduct which they were to ob- 
serve towards each other, and allowed war to be waged 
by an innocent against an offending nation, when rendered 
just and necessary by unprovoked, atrocious, and unre- 
dressed injuries. 

Thus two kinds of justifiable warfare arose — one against 
domestic malefactors ; the other against foreign aggressors. 
The first being regulated by the law of the land ; the 
second by the law of nations ; and both consistently with 
the moral law. 

As to the^rs^ species of warfare, in every state or king- 
dom, the government or executive ruler has, throughout all 
ages, pursued, and often at the expense of blood, attacked, 
captured, and subdued murderers, robbers, and other offend- 
ers. By force confining them in chains and in prisons ; 
and by force inflicting on them punishment, never rendering 
to them good for evil ; for that duty attaches to individuals 
in their personal or private capacities ; but not to rulers or 
magistrates in their official capacities. This species of war 
has constantly and universally been deemed just and indis- 
pensable. On this topic the gospel is explicit. It com- 
mands us to obey the higher powers or ruler. It reminds 
us " that he beareth not the sword in vain ;" that " he is the 
minister of God, and a revenger to execute wrath upon 
him that doeth evil." Now, if he is not to bear the sword 
in vain, it follows that he is to use it to execute wrath on 
evil doers, and consequently to draw blood and to kill on 
proper occasions. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 395 

As to the second species of warfare, it certainly is 
reasonable and as righl thai a nation be secure against in- 
justice, disorder, and rapine from without, as from within: 
and therefore that it is the right and the duty of the gov- 
ernment or ruler, to use force and the sword to protect and 
maintain the rights of his people against evil doers of an- 
other nation. The reason and necessity of using force and 
the sword being the same in both eases, the right or the 
law must be the same also. 

We are commanded to render to our government, or to 
our " Caesar, the things that are Caesar's;" that is, the things 
which belong to him, and not the things which do not 
belong to him. And surely this command eannot be con- 
strued to intend or imply, that we ought to render to the 
Caesar of another nation more than belongs to him. 

In case some powerful Caesar should demand of us to 
receive and obey a king of his nomination, and unite with 
him in all his wars, or that he would commence hostilities 
against us ; what answer would it be proper for us to give 
to such a demand? In my opinion we ought to refu 
and vigorously defend our independence by arms. To 
what other expedient could we have recourse? I cannot 
think that the gospel authorizes or encourages us, on such 
an occasion, to abstain from resistance, and to expect mira- 
cles to deliver us. 

A very feeble unprepared nation, on receiving such a 
demand, might hesitate and find it expedient to adopt the 
policy intimated in the gospel ; viz. " What king, going to 
war against another king, sitteth not down first andconsult- 
eth whether he be aide with ten thousand to meet him that 
cometh against him with twenty thousand ; or else he send- 
eth an embassage, and desireth conditions of peace," that 
is, makes the best bargain he can. 

If the United States should unanimously resolve never 
more to use the sword, would a certified copy of it prove 
to be an effectual Mediterranean passport ? Would it 



396 LIFE OP JOHN JAY. 

reform the predatory rulers of Africa, or persuade the suc- 
cessive potentates of Europe to observe towards us the 
conduct of real Christians 1 On the contrary, would it not 
present new facilities, and consequently produce new ex- 
citements to the gratification of avarice and ambition ? 

It is true, that even just war is attended with evils, and 
so likewise is the administration of government and of 
justice ; but is that a good reason for abolishing either of 
them ? They are means by which greater evils are 
averted. Among the various means necessary to obviate 
or remove, or repress, or to mitigate the various calamities, 
dangers, and exigences, to which in this life we are ex- 
posed, how few are to be found which do not subject us to 
troubles, privations, and inconveniences of one kind or 
other. To prevent the incursion or continuance of evils, 
we must submit to the use of those means, whether agree- 
able or otherwise, which reason and experience prescribe. 

It is also true, and to be lamented, that war, however 
just and necessary, sends many persons out of this world 
who are ill prepared for a better. And so also does the 
law in all countries. So also does navigation and other 
occupations. Are they therefore all sinful and forbidden ? 

However desirable the abolition of all wars may be, yet 
until the morals and manners of mankind are greatly 
changed, it will be found impracticable. We are taught 
that national sins will be punished, and that war is one of 
the punishments. The prophets predict wars at so late a 
period as the restoration of the Israelites. Who or what 
can hinder the occurrence of those wars ? 

I nevertheless believe, and have perfect faith in the pro- 
phecy, that the time will come when " the nations will beat 
their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into prun- 
ing-hooks ; when nation shall not lift up sword against na- 
tion, neither shall they learn war any more." But, does 
not this prophecy clearly imply, and give us plainly to un- 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 397 

derstand, that in the meanwhile, and until the arrival of that 
blessed period, the nations will not heat their swords into 
ploughshares, nor their spears into pruning-hooks ; that 
nation will nol forbear to lift up sword against nation, nor 
cease to learn war ' 

It may 1 d, are we to do nothing to hasten the arri- 

val of that happy period ! Literally, no created being can 
either accelerate or retard its arrival. It will not arrive 
sooner nor later than the appointed time. 

There certainly is reason to expect, that as great provi- 
dential events have usually been preceded and introduced 
by the intervention of providential means to prepare the 
way for them, so the great event in question will be pre- 
ceded and introduced in like manner. It is, I think, more 
than probable, that the unexpected and singular co-opera- 
tion, and the extraordinary zeal and efforts of almost all 
Christian nations to extend the light and knowledge of the 
gospel, and to inculcate its doctrines, are among those pre- 
paratory means. It is the duty of Christians to promote 
the prevalence and success of such means, and to look for- 
ward with faith and hope to the result of them. 

But, whatever may be the time, or the means adopted 
by Providence for the abolition of war, I think we may, 
without presumption, conclude, that mankind must be pre- 
pared and fitted for the reception, enjoyment, and preserva- 
tion of universal permanent peace, before they will be 
blessed with it. Arc the}- as yet fitted for it? Certainly 
not. Even if it was practicable, would it be wise to disarm 
the good before " the wicked cease from troubling ?" By 
what other means than arms and military force, can un- 
offending rulers and nations protect their rights against 
unprovoked aggressions from within and from without? 
Are there any other means to which they could recur, and 
on the efficacy of which they could rely ? To this ques- 
tion I have not as yet heard, nor seen, a direct and precise 
answer.

These remarks would have been written and sent sooner, 
had my health been better. Expedition not being requisite, 
I attended to them only at intervals which allowed and in- 
vited me to do so. 

We differ in opinion, and I am persuaded with equal 
sincerity. 

With real esteem and regard, I remain, 

Your friend, 

John Jay. 

from judge peters. 

Belmont, Dec. 12th, 1815. 

My dear Sir, 

Although our correspondence is rare, my most sincere 
regards for you are uninterrupted. I have outlived, and so 
have you, so many old friends and contemporaries, that the 
very few left are the more valuable for their scarcity ; new 
acquaintances I make the most of, but old and valued friends 
delight me with solid enjoyments, more easily felt than de- 
scribed ; and yet in what is called society, a bystander would 
suppose that I never had any other than the companions of the 
day. I seldom mix with what is now called convivial society ; 
but though an inveterate water-drinker, I can keep pace with 
such society by sympathy. I live with my old friends (not 
seldom with you) as the Swedenborgians do with departed 
spirits. Strong attachment, and zealous recollections work 
up the predisposed fancy into a belief of real presence. It 
is a pleasing delusion, which gray -bearded scrutiny, and 
what is called rational investigation should never extinguish. 
It is a most agreeable and fascinating cullibility, whereof it 
is more wise than foolish to become the willing and unre- 
sisting dupe. 

I have continued in my judicial employment more from 
habit than inclination, and it is at times burdensome, and 
always ill requited. I see Congress are about new-modelling 
the department, and what they will make of it, I do not 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 3<J9 

know (possibly they do not themselves know), nor do I feel 
much anxiety on ihe subject. The whole state of things 
is so different from what we in our day contemplated, that 
it is more surprising our judicial arrangements, formed in 
the early stage of our national existence, should have con- 
tinued so long and so effectively, than that they should now 
be changed. 

My attention to my judicial duty has abstracted me fr< 
my private affairs ; which arc. however, tree from the em- 
barrassments which have overwhelmed many adventurers, 
who had better have been idle. My thorough-bass amusement 
consists in rural enjoyments, which have been more profit- 
able to others than myself. I have given you a specimen 
of this kind of enjoyment by directing our fourth volume of 
Memoirs to be sent to you, and I hope it will arrive safely 
to your hands. There may not be much instruction, but 
we have assisted in raising our fellow-citizens to proper 
views of the real and substantial interests of our country. 
There is a most gratifying spirit everywhere on this subject, 
by which the rising generation may profit ; but it is too late 
in the day for either you or I to enjoy much of its advan- 
tages. So we thought, however, in our revolutionary 
exertions, and yet what a mass of prosperity and happiness 
have we lived to see accumulated in every quarter of our 
country ! When I carry my recollections back to my early 
knowledge of its husbandry, the contrast exhibited by its 
present improvement (yet but imperfect) fills me with most 
pleasing sensations. 

There is a jealousy in our mother country still apparent 
of most of the rapid improvements we have arrived at; and 
I have strong expectations that those in agriculture will ere 
long equal, if not exceed all others. 1 keep up a good un- 
derstanding with the British agricultural people with whom 
I come in contact; but it amuses me to perceive that, 
although many are liberal, many are otherwise. Some 
years ago we sent a volume oi" our. Memoirs to Scotland. 



400 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

It was very civilly received ; but several of their leading 
agricultors took occasion to observe that we were an hundred 
years behind them, and even very unequal to English 
farming. So I left Sawney and John Bull to settle that 
point. I sent lately an American scythe and cradle, which 
they had not before seen ; nor was it used in England. 
They received it graciously ; and I had civil thanks from 
a vice-president of the Board of Agriculture : but he at 
the same time let me know that it was a Flemish, and not 
an American implement. I desired my friend who trans- 
mitted the cold civility, to have it labelled "a Flemish im- 
plement, sent to England by the way of the United States 
of America /" There is an awkward instrument in Flanders 
containing the rudiments of our scythe and cradle, but as 
unequal to ours as their ships to those of our country ; yet 
ours are American ships^and not a little envied and 
squinted at. 

I have been lately reading, with great pleasure, the Life of 
our late distinguished friend Dr. Franklin. Have you read 
it ? I see he glosses over in a letter to the then secretary for 
foreign affairs (Livingston) the affair of Vergennes sending 
his secretary to England, pending our negotiations in the 
treaty of peace. I think you told me all about it ; and I 
have ever had different impressions from those the Dr. 
portrays. He says it was merely to ascertain whether or 
not the British ministry had serious intentions to make an 
equal, solid, and lasting peace with us and our allies. I have 
always believed there was an underplot in the business. I 
think something of this appears in your journal, which I 
assisted to read in Congress in 1782 and 3. Much bruit 
was made then by the French diplomacy, about your sign- 
ing the preliminaries without previous notice to them ; but 
I always thought you entirely in the right, not only as a se- 
curity in so important a measure, but to guard against em- 
barrassments, with reason apprehended from the French ma- 
noeuvres. I voted against an unwarrantable philippic of cen- 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 101 

sure, brought forward in Congress against your conduct, to 
please the French. I thought then, and do now, that it was 
a mean compliance. < hw friend Madison, who was generally 
then with us, left his friends on thai subject, and 1 never liked 
him the better for it. 

I see Congress have rejected the claim of Beaumachi'fl 
representatives. All my recollections put them in the right 
in so doing. True, Silas Deane made an ostensible private 
contract with B. ; but I always was taught to believe him a 
mere showman, and that the supplies were a gift from France, 
which she could not openly then avow. The unaccounted 
money, about which much noise has been made, I ah\ ays 
believed to have been devoted to secret service and douceurs 
to French agents, whose remunerations could not publicly 
appear. All or most of the articles went through my hands, 
or under my observation, u hen in the war office, and a mi »re 
complete piece of fripponerie never was seen. Very many 
of the articles were worthless, and among them the brass 
cannon were old rampart pieces, only valuable for the metal, 
which was recast in our foundries. All these things, how- 
ever, appear now as dreams. What is real, and lives longer 
than these transactions in my memory, is, that I am always, 
and have been, truly and affectionately yours,

Dear Sir, 

I have read your letter of the 12th ult. more than once. 
Mutuality of friendly feelings always affords gratification ; 
and the kindness which pervades your letter has made its 
proper impressions.

the seventy- fourth of mine, our leases have expired. We 
are holding over, and others will soon occupy our places.

402 LITE OF JOHN JAY. 

What to do, and where to go, would be perplexing ques- 
tions, had not our beneficent Lessor offered us better and 
permanent habitations. 

The death of an excellent daughter last spring was an 
afflicting event, and I feel it. Convinced that her happiness 
was augmented by it, I had no reason to grieve on her ac- 
count. I derived consolation, as well as resignation, from 
reflecting that unerring wisdom had directed that dispensa- 
tion, and that I was still blessed with the surviving children, 
who (like their sister) had never given me any other uneasi- 
ness than what had arisen from their sickness or afflictions. 

Considering the times which have passed over us, I am 
glad you continued in office. Might not reports of some 
select cases decided in your court be useful 1 And would 
they not be more correctly prepared for the press by your- 
self than by others ? 

In my opinion, you did well to abstain from speculations. 
I thought so, and did so. It is, I believe, a just and not a 
new remark, that a proper education and proper habits, 
with a moderate share of property, form a better provision 
for a child, than that greater degree of wealth, which not 
unfrequently leads the unexperienced to idleness and its 
results. 

I have looked into the book which you had the goodness 
to send me, and for which I thank you. I have read the 
address, and the notices for a young farmer. They will do 
good. Although unable to attend much to my own agri- 
cultural affairs, yet books and conversation on such subjects 
entertain me. I wish I could give you a good account of 
my Tunisian sheep, but the dogs have put it out of my 
power. I regret the loss they caused ; but I regret it less 
than another loss, which more nearly affects my conve- 
nience. I allude to the death of a favourite mare, which I 
had rode for twenty- three years with great satisfaction. 
She lately died suddenly and unexpectedly, in the twenty- 
ninth year of her age. She was the third in succession, 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 403 

which died in my service. The grandam was given to me 

by my father in 1765. That circumstance associated with 
various others in attaching me to them. 

Agricultural societies arc multipl) ing in this State. One 
has been formed in this county, and 1 am the nominal presi- 
dent ; having only the will and not the ability to render 
active services. They have prepared a representation to 
the Legislature respecting agriculture, and the expediency 
oi establishing an agricultural society for the whole State. 

The traits of parsimonious and reluctant commendation 
observable in some of your British letters, give more intel- 
ligence than the writers meant to convey. As almost every 
vagrant leaf we pick up will inform us of the kind of tree 
which produced it, so these traits discover the feelings 
which originated them. It is a pity that such feelings should 
exist; but they are the offspring of human nature, which is 
not what it should be, nor what it once was. That Britons 
should reflect on our former and present state and condition, 
without regret, without mortification, and without appre- 
hensions of rivalry and perhaps of danger, can hardly be 
expected. A doubt whether Britannia will always "rule 
the waves," cannot have a welcome reception in her mind. 
Our rapid progress in trade, navigation, and the arts, cannot 
correspond with her views and wishes. The strength 
resulting from our increasing resources and population, 
recommends a kind of policy and a degree of accommoda- 
tion not congenial with the temper and propensities of such 
a nation. Superiors seldom see with complacency inferiors 
rising towards equality, and by means which may not im- 
probably carry them beyond it. There is, nevertheless, 
great worth in Britain. 

I have not seen Dr. Franklin's Life. As he concurred in 
the opinion of Count de Vergennes, th I we should proceed 
to treat for peace with Great Britain without a previous 
admission of our independence, he may, in his own mind, 



404 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

have acquitted the count of the motives to which I ascribed 
his giving us that opinion ; and also have considered his 
subsequent explanations on that and certain other topics 
as satisfactory. After mv return in 1784, I was informed 
of the debate in Congress on the proposed resolution which 
you mention. In my opinion, Mr. Madison voted consist- 
ently. I omit explaining this at present, for it cannot be 
done in a few words. My letter to Congress respecting 
the negotiation contained a full and correct statement of 
facts. Many years have since elapsed, but my sentiments 
relative to the policy adopted by France on that occasion 
continue unaltered. 

But it is time to conclude, and I will do it by thanking 
you for affording me so agreeable an occasion to assure you 
of the esteem and regard, with which I continue 

Your friend,

Bedford, 27th Feb., 1819. 

I thank you, my good friend, for the kind letter (without 
date) which my son lately delivered to me, and for the 
pamphlets which were enclosed with it. 

The observations of your friend (inserted in your letter) 
are well written. I am pleased with the writer. He rea- 
sons with ability, and abstains from declamation. The 
lawfulness of the invasion and conquest of Canaan, being 
made by express Divine command, is indubitable. It does 
not decide the question, whether any wars, unless so com- 
manded, are permitted by the moral law, and consequently 
by the gospel. Such wars occurred both before and after 
the time of Moses, and are recorded in Scripture without 
reproof. It does not appear that the war of Abraham 
against the kings was made by Divine command, nor that 
Jacob was commanded to take " out of the hand of the 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 405 

Amorite, with His sword and his how," the portion which 
he gave to Josepii ; nor does it appear that the war of 
David against Ilanun, and divers other wars, were so 
commanded. 

That the theocracy admitted of no other wars by the 
Israelites hut such as were expressly commanded by the 
Almighty, is not clear to me. Had Solomon heen of that 
opinion, I think he could not with propriety have taught 
that "by counsel thou shalt make war ; and in a multitude 
of counsellors there is safety. Every purpose is established 
by counsel; and with good advice make war." 

This, and other topics with which it is connected, open a 
wide field for investigation; but as the state of my health 
does not permit me to be more particular, I will only add, 
that when the arguments in favour of just and necessary 
war shall be shown to be fallacious, I shall not only think, 
but also act accordino-lv. 

The extract from William Penn forms a useful tract ; 
and among other reasons, because it declares that '-'the 
Scriptures were given forth by holy men of God in divers 
ages, as they were moved by the Holy Spirit." I observe 
that this great truth is also inculcated by the trustees of the 
African Free School in their address. 

I did hope to have found in your letter some tidings re- 
specting your brother. When you write to him, assure 
him of my esteem and regard ; and he pleased to accept 
the like assurance from 

Your friend,

Sir, 
I received by the last mail the pamphlet on " the Mis-

pernicious influence of slavery on the welfare of our coun- 
try in conspicuous and impressive points of view. 

The obvious dictates both of morality and policy teach 
us, that our free nation cannot encourage the extension of 
slavery, nor the multiplication of slaves, without doing 
violence to their principles, and without depressing their 
power and prosperity. 

It appears to me desirable, that your remarks and state- 
ments, as well as the excellent arguments of Mr. King, 
should be widely diffused ; they will have a strong tendency 
to render public opinion on this very important subject cor- 
rect and settled. 

Accept my acknowledgments for this mark of attention, 
and for the inducements which prompted it. 

I am, sir, 
Your obliged and obedient servant,

from judge peters. 

Belmont, 25th November, 1820. 
Dear Sir, 
Every occurrence in which you have shared, or origin- 
ated, seems, by some strange perversion, to be misunder- 
stood or misstated by the present generation, when some 
favourite individual or topic induces the obliquity. Al- 
though I give Mr. Adams his full share of merit in the 
affair of the Count de Vergennes' manoeuvring with the 
British administration on the subject of our treaty of 1783, 
yet I have felt indignant that your name should have been 
omitted in the Massachusetts' Conventional account of the 
matter ; and Mr. Adams held out as the principal figure, 
when you should have been the prominent and leading 
portrait in the group. I am sure Mr. Vaughan will not 
justify this statement of the transaction, though he is alluded 
to as confirming it by one of the speakers in the Massa- 
chusetts' Convention. His account of it to me was exactly 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 107 

as you stated it in your letter to Congress, which I - 
and read at the time of its being the subject of our con- 
sideration; when, as I wrote to you, the unjustifiable vi 
Mas taken as to the unmerited censure of proceeding with- 
out the concurrence of the French ministry, in our adjust- 
ment with Great Britain. 

In your letter to me, in answer to my relation of what 
passed at this place in a conversation with Mr. 15. Vaughan, 
a year or more ago, in relation to the affair, and when 
I told you he confirmed my recollections on the sub- 
ject, you only refer to your letter to Congress. I think 
some additional statement of facts should be left, lest the 
archives of the office of state may suffer the catastrophe 
which destroyed all the records of transactions in the war 
office. The truth of history depends on fair and correct 
relations of the conduct of individuals to whom public 
transactions were committed. The biography of those in- 
dividuals is one thing, the national character is another ; 
but both are united in the inquiry on this subject. 

Among the pleasures of memory (which has many pains) 
the recollection of old friendships is one of the most delight- 
ful. Among these, my remembrances of your personal 
regard is one of the most prominent gratifications. When- 
soever any thing turns up in which you were concerned, 
all my sensibilities recur. 

I begin to feel some of the infirmities of age ; but, in 
general, am highly favoured with good health. The most 
extraordinary depression of property is no cordial to 
landed proprietors ; but those who will soon occupy a 
small portion, and leave their extensive possessions behind 
them, need not much deplore the "hard times" which have 
fallen on us. The friends of peace have nothing to encour- 
age them, when universal peace brings along with it uni- 
versal privation, and much distress to individuals. But we 
have wantoned in prosperity : and cannot bear the check

which circumstances have given to our career — -festina 
lentc must hereafter be our motto. I trust you enjoy as 
much health as you have heretofore experienced, though I 
cannot flatter myself that it is perfect. My best wishes 
constantly attend you ; and I beg you to be assured of the 
sincere regard with which I am always 

Affectionately yours, 

Richard Peters. 

P.S. I have just got home from the drudgery of a long 
circuit court, and am not the better for the campaign. 
Washington has benun his return to Mount Vernon, much 
broken down. He came convalescent ; having had a 
severe attack of an illness which pervaded all the country 
in his vicinity. He must renew his stamina, or he will not

TO JUDGE TETERS. 

Bedford, 26th December, 1820. 

I thank you cordially, my good and constant friend, for 
your letter of the 25th ult. It affords me no little gratifi- 
cation. We grow old, but our hearts retain their warmth. 

The perversion and obliquity you notice has not been 
recent nor unexpected. Men who are ardent in the pur- 
suit of influence and its fruits, and more attentive to the 
prosecution than to the propriety of their schemes, usually 
become and remain hostile to those who steadfastly disap- 
prove of their manoeuvres. Instead of regulating their hos- 
tility by truth and candour, they generally find it con- 
venient to recur to perversion and obliquity. 

The conventional statement to which you allude, was 
doubtless devised and formed, in the manner which its pro- 
jectors deemed to be best accommodated to the objects they 
had in view. So many years have elapsed since the nego- 
tiations at Paris, that only a few individuals among the 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 

present members of any oi our popular assemblies, probably 
possess ample and accurate knowledge of those negotia- 
tions. 

On considering your hint of my making some statement 
of facts relative to them, in addition to my letter to Con- 
gress, which, you observe, may (like the papers of the war 
office) be accidentally destroyed, I think that precaution 
will not be necessary. I have a honk in which are i 
that and all my other official letters to Congress. 

An accurate and well-written history of the United States, 
down to the conclusion of the late war, is desirable. But 
my expectations on that head are not sanguine. Time is 
daily obscuring and diminishing the materials, and the task 
becoming more and more difficult. The marks of talent 
and rectitude which appear in the Life of Washington, by 
Judge Marshall, have induced me to regret that he had 
not commenced such a history, and incorporated that life 
in it. The mass of information he has collected continues 
to afford facilities for such a work, and it would more than 
answer the purpose of a new edition of the other. Who- 
ever may undertake it, would, in my opinion, do well to 
give it the advantage of frequent revision, and postpone the 
publication until a period when the events and circum- 
stances related in it, had ceased to produce personal and 
political excitement. 

I rejoice in your continuing to enjoy good health. I will 
not say with the Spaniards, "may you live a thousand 
years;" for that would postpone greater blessings. The 
name and character of Judge Washington interest me in his 
welfare. I hope he will be restored to health. The pre- 
vailing disease which attacked him, I suspect, was the 
same which visited us — influenza. Few families here 
escaped. I have had it, but not severely: it has left a 
cough, which still gives me some trouble. Although too 
feeble to go often beyond the piazza, yet I experience no 
depression of spirits, nor frequent returns of acute pain.

Here also the distress of the times is felt very sensibly. 
Habits of expense, unproductive speculations, and debts 
injudiciously contracted, press hard both upon debtors and 
creditors. How long this state of things will continue, 
or how much good or evil will eventually result from it, 
cannot now be calculated. They who hope for the best 
and prepare for the worst, will doubtless mitigate some of 
their troubles, and probably obviate the occurrence of some 
others.

Bedford, Westchester County, N, Y., 1 
13th Jan., 1821. \ 

Sir, 

I have received your letter of the 23d ult. expressing a 
desire that Botta's History and your Translation of it may 
have my approbation ; and also that I would mention to 
you the most authentic of the documents which are before 
the public, relative to the negotiations at Paris in 1782. 

Having, as yet, received and read only the first volume 
of the History, I cannot form, and consequently cannot ex- 
press, an opinion of the whole work. 

As to the first volume, there are in it certain assertions, 
representations, and suggestions, of which there are some 
which I believe to be erroneous, and others which I suspect 
to be inaccurate. Being too feeble either to write or to 
re id much at a time without fatigue, I forbear to enumerate 
them. I will nevertheless, for your satisfaction, select and 
notice one of the most important, viz. That anterior to the 
revolution, there existed in the colonies a desire of inde- 
pendence. 

The following extracts respect this topic : viz. 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 411 

Page 10. — "The love of the sovereign and their ancient 
countrv, which the first colonists might have retained in 
their new establishments, gradually diminished in the hearts 
of their descendants." 

Page 11. — •• The greater part of the colonists had heard 
nothing of Great Britain, excepting that it was a distant 
kingdom, from which their ancestors had been barbarously 
expelled." 

Pane 12. — "As the means of restraint became almost 
illusory in the hands of the government, there must 1, 
arisen and gradually increased in the minds of the Am 
cans, the hope, and with it the desire, to shake off the yoke 
of English superiority." " The colonists supported im- 
patiently the superiority of the British government." 

Page 15. — "Such was the state of the English coloi 
in America; such the opinions and dispositions of tl 
who inhabited them, about the middle of the eighteenth 
tury" " It was impossible that they should have remained 
ignorant of what they were capable; and that the pi 
sive development of national pride should not have ren- 
dered the British yoke intolerable." 

Pace 33. — " Alreadv those who were the most zealous 
for liberty, or the most ambitious, had formed, in the secret 
of their hearts, the resolution to shake off the yoke of 1 
land, whenever a favourable occasion should present. This 
design was encouraged by the recent cession of Canada." 

Page 199. — "The colonists looked upon it (the Congress 
of 1774) as a convention of men who, in some mode or 
other, were to deliver their country from the perils that 
menaced it. The greater part believed that their ability, 
&c. would enable them to obtain from the government a 
removal of the evils that oppressed them, and the re-estab- 
lishment of the ancient order of things. Some others 
cherished the belief that they would find means to conduct 
the American nation to that independence which was the 
first and most ardent of their aspirations ; or rather the 



412 LIFE OP JOHN JAY. 

sole object of that intense passion which stung and tor- 
mented them night and day." 

Page 314. — "Both (Putnam and Ward) had declared 
themselves too openly in favour of independence. The 
Congress desired indeed to procure it, but withal in a pro- 
pitious ti i.e." 

Page 388. — " Thus censed, as we have related, the royal 
authority in the different provinces. It was replaced pro- 
gressively by that of the people ; that is, by Congresses or 
Conventions extraordinary, that were formed in each 
colony. But this was deemed insufficient by those who 
directed the affairs of America; their real object being 
independence" &c. 

Explicit professions and assurances of allegiance and 
loyalty to the sovereign (especially since the accession of 
King William), and of affection for the mother country, 
abound in lire journals of the colonial Legislatures, and of 
the Congresses and Conventions, from early periods to the 
second petition of Congress in 1775. 

If these professions and assurances were sincere, they 
afford evidence more than sufficient to invalidate the charge 
of our desiring and aiming at independence. 

If, on the other hand, these professions and assurances 
were factitious and deceptive, they present to the world an 
unprecedented instance of long continued, concurrent, and 
detestable duplicity in the colonies. Our country does not 
deserve this odious and disgusting imputation. During the 
course of my life, and until after the second petition of 
Congress in 1775, I never did hear any American of any 
class, or of any description, express a wish for the inde- 
pendence of the colonies. 

Few Americans had more, or better means and oppor- 
tunities of becoming acquainted with the sentiments and- 
dispositions of the colonists, relative to public affairs, than 
Dr. Franklin. In a letter to his son, dated the 22d March, 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 1 1 3 

1775, he relates a conversation which he had with Lord 

Chatham in the preceding month of August. His lordship 
having mentioned an opinion prevailing in England, that 
America aimed at setting up for herself as an independ- 
ent state, the Dr. thus expressed himself: "I assured him. 
that having more than once travelled almost from i 
end of the continent to the other, and kept a great variety 
of company, eating, drinking, and conversing with them 
freely, I never had heard in any conversation from any 
person, drunk or sober, the least expression of a wish for a 
separation, or a hint that such a thing would be advan- 
tageous to America." 

It does not appear to me necessary to enlarge further on 
this subject. It has always been and still is my opinion 
and belief, that our country was prompted and impelled to 
independence by necessity, and not by choice. They who 
know how we were then circumstanced, know from 
whence that necessity resulted. 

It would, indeed, be extraordinary, if a foreigner, re- 
mote (like Mr. Botta) from the best sources of authentic 
information, should, in writing such a history, commit no 
mistakes. That gentleman doubtless believed his narra- 
tions to be true, but it is not improbable that he some- 
times selected his materials with too little apprehension 
of error, and that some of his informers were too little 
scrupulous. This remark derives a degree of weight from 
the following passage in the History, viz. General Mont- 
gomery "left a wife, the object of all his tenderness, with 
several children, still infants, a spectacle tor their country, 
at once of pity and admiration. The state, from gratitude 
towards their father, distinguished them with every mark 
of kindness and protection.*' 1 have been acquainted with 
General Montgomery's widow from my youth. The fact 
is, that she never had a child. 

In making the translation, attention has doubtless been 
paid to the rule, that a translator should convey into his 



414 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

translation, with perspicuity and precision, the ideas of his 
author, and no others, and express them, not literally, but 
in well-adapted classical language. How far your transla- 
tion is exactly correct, I am an incompetent judge ; for not 
understanding the language of the original, I cannot ex- 
amine and compare the translation with it. Of the style 
and manner of the translation, I think well. 

Which are the most authentic documents before the pub- 
lic, relative to the negotiations at Paris in 1782, is a ques- 
tion which I am not in capacity to answer. Many years 
have elapsed since I have read any of them, and others 
have since been published which I have not seen. Without 
a previous and careful examination of each of them, it 
would be rash and unfair to give a preference to either. 

On receiving your first letter, I conjectured that you 
was of the respectable family of your name in Massa- 
chusetts ; and that conjecture appears from your last to 
have been well founded. If, in going from- Philadelphia to 
Boston, you should not find it inconvenient to take the road 
through this town, you will meet with a welcome recep- 
tion from 

Your obedient servant, 

John Jay. 

from george alexander otis. 

Quincy, 19th February, 1822. 
Sir, 

I did not receive your very kind and very gratifying com- 
munication of the 13th January, 1821, until after I had re- 
joined my family in this place ; and consequently, not till 
after it was too late to profit, in passing homeward, of your 
very obliging permission to pay you my respects personally ; 
a satisfaction which I regret in proportion to the just sense 
I have of its value. 

Your remarks on the first volume of Botta, confirmed as 
they were by Presidents Adams and Jefferson, were com- 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 415 

municated to the reviewers of my translation of that author, 
and were by them introduced into their account of the work 
published in the North American Review for July, L821. 

An apprehension of appearing to press with ten little con- 
sideration on your indulgent courtesy, has hitherto deterred 
me from solicit in <r your judgment of the remaining volumes. 

The prospect, however, of an approaching call for another 
edition, induces me to hazard the prayer that if your health 
and leisure admit, you would have the compli e to 

favour me with any remarks which may have occurred to 
vou for the interest of truth, relative to the second and third 
volumes of this history. 

With respect to the animadversions which you did me the 
honour to address to me upon the tirst volume, and which I 
took the liberty to communicate to the late Presidents Adams 
and Jefferson, the former of these gentlemen wrote me as 
follows : 

"I cannot refrain from expressing the pleasure I have 
received from the reasoning of Mr. Jay upon the passage 
in Botta, ' that anterior to the revolution there existed in 
the colonies a desire of independence.' There is great am- 
biguity in this expression, ' there existed in the colonies a de- 
sire of independence? It is true, there always existed in the 
colonies a desire of independence of parliament in the ar- 
ticles of internal taxation and internal policy, and a very 
general, if not an universal opinion, that tiny were con- 
stitutionally entitled to it, and as general a determination, if 
possible, to maintain and defend it ; hut there never existed 
a desire of independence of tin; crown, or of general regu- 
lations of commerce, for the equal and impartial benefit of 
all parts of the empire. It is true, there might be times 
and circumstances in which an individual or a few individ- 
uals might entertain and express a wish, that America was 
independent in all respects ; but these were " rari nantes 
in gurgite vasto." For example, in one thousand seven hun- 
dred and fifty-six, seven, and eight, the conduct of the 



416 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

British Generals Shirley, Braddock, Loudon, Webb, and 
Abercrombie. was so absurd, disastrous, and destructive, that 
a very general opinion prevailed that the war was conducted 
by a mixture of ignorance, treachery, and cowardice ; and 
some persons wished we had nothing to do with Great 
Britain for ever. Of this number, I distinctly remember, I 
was myself one ; fully believing that we were able to defend 
ourselves against the French and Indians, without any as- 
sistance or embarrassments from Great Britain. In fifty- 
eight and fifty-nine, when Amherst and Wolfe had changed 
the fortune of the war, by a more able and faithful conduct 
of it, I again rejoiced in the name of Briton, and should 
have rejoiced in it to this day, had not the king and par- 
liament committed high treason and rebellion against Amer- 
ica, as soon as they had conquered Canada and made peace 
with France. That there existed a general desire of inde- 
pendence of the crowm, in any part of America, before the 
revolution, is as far from truth as the zenith is from the nadir. 
The encroaching disposition of Great Britain, it was early 
foreseen by many wise men in all the States, would one day 
attempt to enslave them by an unlimited submission to parlia- 
ment, and rule them with a rod of iron; that this attempt would 
produce resistance on the part of America, and an awful 
struggle, was also foreseen, but dreaded and deprecated as 
the greatest calamity that could befall them. For my own 
part, there was not a moment during the revolution when 
I would not have given every thing I possessed for a 
restoration to the state of things before the contest began, 
provided we could have had a sufficient security for its con- 
tinuance," &c. &c." 

Mr. Jefferson says, in fewer words, "I confirm, by my 
belief, Mr. Jay's criticisms on the passages quoted from 
Botta. I can answer for its truth from this State south- 
wardly, and northwardly I believe to New York, for which 
State Mr. Jay himself is a competent witness. What, 
eastward of that, might have been the dispositions towards 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 117 

England before the commencement of hostilities, I 
know not; before that I never had heard a whisper of a 
disposition to separate from Great Britain ; and after that, 
its possibility was contemplated with affliction by all," &c. 
With many acknowledgments for the attentions with 
which you have deigned to honour my undertaking, and the 
encouraging tone with which you were pleased to cheer me 
on to its accomplishment. I pray you to be assured of the 
profound veneration and perfect esteem of, sir, 

Your much obliged, and most humble servant, 

George Alexaxuer Otis. 

to judge peters. 

Bedford, 12th March, 1821. 

Dear Sir, 

My letter to you of the 20th December last, contained 
some remarks relative to the perversions and obliquities 
which you had noticed, and which I observed were neither 
recent nor unexpected. In that letter, there was not room 
for explanatory details. Those remarks were therefore 
concise and general. To supply that deficiency is the 
design of this letter. 

These perversions and obliquities began on the receipt of 
a letter which I wrote to Congress, and of which the fol- 
lowing is a copy. 

[Here was inserted the letter of 20/// Sept., 1781, relative 
to the instruction to the American commissioners appointed 
to negotiate the treaty of peace. See vol. i. p. 121.] 

This letter was written under the influence of indignant 
feelings, and in some respects with too little of deliberate 
consideration. The impressions it made on those who had 
originated and urged the instruction mentioned in it. may 
easily be conceived. 

That this instruction was more complimentary than wise, 
was afterward evinced by the circumstances which con- 
strained the American commissioners at Paris to disobey 

VOL. II. G G G 



418 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

it. That disobedience gave additional excitement to the 
displeasure and to the complaints of the French and their 
consociates. Nor were they pleased with the implied 
approbation of that disobedience, which resulted from my 
appointment to the office of secretary for foreign affairs, 
before my arrival in 1784. From time to time after my 
return, I was informed of various incidents which showed 
that their malevolence was far from being dormant. 

The presumptuous attempts of the republican minister 
Genet, to facilitate the designs of France at the hazard of 
our peace and neutrality, gave occasion to the measures of 
President Washington on that subject. Disappointed and 
irritated by these impediments, Genet and his partisans in- 
dulged themselves in animadversions on the administration 
and its advocates, which were neither candid nor decorous. 

The treaty with England in 1794, did not accord with the 
views and wishes of France, nor with the views and wishes of 
sundry individuals among us. Although the strenuous efforts 
made to defeat it did not succeed, yet the feelings and mo- 
tives which prompted those efforts continued to operate. 

Certain politicians, desirous to give a new direction to 
public opinion, finally succeeded in forming a party for the 
purpose, and in introducing a policy varying from that 
which President Washington and his friends had preferred. 
Those friends were not regarded with a friendly eye. 

They who censured the precipitate commencement, and 
the unsuccessful conduct of the late war with England, 
incurred the resentment of those by whom these errors 
were committed. 

Among those who had been active federalists, there were 
individuals who, at subsequent periods, were induced to 
think it expedient for them to join the opposing party. 
They who thus pass from one side to the other, are apt to 
mistake cunning for wisdom, and to act accordinglv. 

These details will suffice to explain the concise remarks 
in my letter. Many more might be added, and I could fill

much paper with apposite anecdotes; but T forbear to en- 
large on topics which (mutatis mutandis) the history of 
Greece and other countries, as well as observation and 
experience, have rendered familiar to us both. 

In the course of my public life, I have en ured to be 

uniform and independent ; having, from the I of it 

in 1774, never asked for an office or a vote, nor declined 
expressing my sentiments respecting such important public 
measures as, in my opinion, tended to promote or retard the 
welfare of our country.

Bedford, 24th April, 1821. 
My good Friend, 

It gives me pleasure to learn from my son, that, in a 
letter lately received by your nephew, you made inquiries 
respecting me. 

We have both experienced afflicting dispensations. Your 
portion of health has for a long time been diminished ; and 
I have not had a well day for the last twelve years. You 
have been deprived of an excellent brother, who was an 
excellent man ; and I of several relations, and particularly 
of an amiable and affectionate daughter. It is a comfort to 
hope and believe, that such dispensations answer merciful 
purposes, and that the time will come when we shall rejoice 
in having been reminded by adversity, that temporal enjoy- 
ments are transient. 

The winter having been more cold than common, has 
confined me to the house during the course of it ; and the 
weather this spring has not yet so mild as to admit of 

my going abroad without risk. x'Uthough my old complaint 
has gradually reduced me to a state of incurable debility, yet 



420 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

I seldom suffer from acute pain, except occasionally from 
rheumatism. In various respects, I have abundant reason 
to be thankful. 

We have both passed the usual term of human life, or 
(as the lawyers say) our leases have expired, and we are 
now holding over. To be thus circumstanced, is not very 
important to those who expect to remove from their present 
abodes to better habitations, and to enjoy them in perpe- 
tuity. That we may both be, and continue to be, num- 
bered with these, is the sincere desire of 

Your affectionate friend, 

John Jay. 

to e. a. brown, governor of ohio. 

Bedford, 30th April, 1821. 

Sir, 

I have received, and thank you for, the interesting report 
of the joint committee of both houses of your Legislature, 
relative to certain proceedings of the Bank of the United 
States, which you were so obliging as to send me. 

Controversies between the national and a state govern- 
ment, or any of their respective departments, are to be 
regretted. It is desirable that the one which occasioned 
this report, should be brought to an amicable and satisfac- 
tory termination ; and that the limits which bound the author- 
ities of the national and state governments be well ascer- 
tained and observed. 

However extensive the constitutional power of a govern- 
ment to impose taxes may be, I think it should not be so 
exercised as to impede or discourage the lawful and useful 
industry and exertions of individuals. Hence, the prudence 
of taxing the products of beneficial labour, either mental or 
manual, appears to be at least questionable. 

Whether taxation should extend only to property, or 
only to income, or to both, are points on which opinions 
have not been uniform. I am inclined to think, that both 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 421 

should not be taxed. If the first is preferred, then tax the 
land and stock of a farmer, but not his crops ; tax his milch- 
cows, but not their milk, nor the butter and cheese made of 
it, whether the same be sent to market or consumed in his 
family. Tax the real and personal estate of a physician 
and a lawyer, but not the conjectural and varying profits 
they derive from the skilful and industrious exercise of 
their professions, &c. &c. 

On this and similar subjects, there will be different opin- 
ions. Our minds are probably as little alike as our fea- 
tures ; and it is not uncommon for men of unquestionable 
talents and candour to take opposite sides of the same ques- 
tion : neither of them being culpable, both are entitled to 
allowances for the risk of committing mistakes, to which 
we are all more or less exposed. 

It is an agreeable circumstance that prosperity attends 
you ; and permit me to add, that for its continuance and 
increase, you have the best wishes of 

Sir, your obliged and obedient servant, 

John Jay, 

from noah webster. 

Amherst, Mass., Nov., 1821. 

Sir, 

When I began the compilation of a large Dictionary of 
the English language, I limited my views chiefly to a cor- 
rection of such errors as had escaped former compilers, and 
the supply of such new terms as have sprung from modern 
improvements in science. But in searching for the originals 
of English words, I soon found the field of etvmologv had 
been imperfectly explored ; and one discovery succeeding 
another, my curiosity was excited to persevere in the pur- 
suit. At length, finding no safe clew to conduct me through 
the labyrinth, I adopted a new plan of investigation — that 
of examining and comparing the primary elements, articu- 



422 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

lations, or consonants of words in twenty different lan- 
guages or dialects ; the vowels having been found so muta- 
ble as to be of no use. 

The result of this examination, has been the formation of 
a synopsis of radical words in more than twenty languages, 
which is complete, or nearly so. This will probably form 
a quarto, and be an appendix to the dictionary. This has 
occupied about ten years ; but I do not, and I think the 
world will not regret the delay which this has occasioned ; 
for if I am not deceived, the discoveries proceeding from 
this investigation will be quite important, and as new in 
Europe as in America. This synopsis exhibits a vast num- 
ber of affinities between the languages examined, which 
have never before been detected. But what I think of more 
value, this investigation has developed, in a multitude of 
words, the primary sense of the root, which has not hitherto 
been known. There is a primary or radical sense of every 
verb, from which all its significations in customary use, are 
naturally and easily deducible ; and from an ignorance of 
this sense, and the manner in which men have proceeded 
from the literal to the metaphorical significations, the most 
learned critics have often been perplexed in determining the 
particular sense of words. For instance, a Hebrew word 
signifies to bless and to curse. With the knowledge of the 
primary sense, these difficulties vanish. 

The languages of which I have made a synopsis, are the 
Chaldaic, Syriac, Arabic, Samaritan, Hebrew, Ethiopic, 
Persian, Irish (Hiberno Celtic), Armoric, Anglo Saxon, 
German, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Greek, Latin, Italian, 
Spanish, French, Russian, with the English. 

I am now proceeding with the dictionary, and I am en- 
gaged in the letter H. Making my past progress the basis 
of calculation, it must require the constant labour of four 
years to complete the work, even if my health should be 
continued. For this blessing I rely tranquilly on the good- 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 423 

ness and forbearance of that Being, whose favour I desire to 
seek in the way which he lias prescribed, and which I trust 
I value above any temporal good. 

But I did not begin my studies early enough. I am now 
sixty-three years of age, and after ibis age, a small portion 
only of active life remains. If, however, I should not be 
permitted to finish the work begun, the synopsis will enable 
some other person to pursue the plan with advantage, so 
that my labour will not be lost to my country. 

I have thought, that after submitting my MSS. to able 
judges, if they should think the work to have merit enough 
to command a sale in England, I may visit that country, 
and attempt to sell the copy there first ; and indeed revise 
the w r ork at Oxford. But on this I am not determined. 
What course I shall pursue is not certain. I am contented 
to leave the event to that good Providence which has 
hitherto supported me. 

The evening before your letter arrived, I was conversing 
respecting you, sir; and I said to my family, that there are 
few men whom I wish so much to see as Gov. Jay. If our 
lives should be spared till next summer, I will make an 
effort to visit you. However this may be, I shall never 
forget your public services, nor your private friendship for,

to noah webster. 

Bedford, 3d December, 1821. 

Sir, 

I have received your letter of the 8th ultimo, and a sub- 
sequent one not dated. Your Dictionary will doubtless 
derive utility and reputation from the extensive investiga- 
tions you mention. The assiduity with which yon have for 
many years persevered, and still persevere, in accomplish- 
ing that arduous task, will, I hope, be followed by results, 
not only beneficial to the public, but also to yourself. 



424 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

There are gentlemen in this country by whom, I pre- 
sume, judicious criticisms and friendly offices would be 
readily afforded. In case a further revision should be 
undertaken with zeal and good-will, at Oxford or Cam- 
bridge, and terminate with explicit commendation, it would 
excite attention both in Britain and America, and produce 
useful consequences. 

To whatever persons the perusal of the manuscripts may 
be committed, permit me to hint that they should be very 
legible. This remark is sucrsrested bv the recollection of an 
incident which occurred many years since. The author of 
a large manuscript, written in an indistinct hand, requested 
a certain gentleman to favour him with his opinion of it. 
The gentleman, after a while, returned it, with some polite 
general observations of little importance. It seems he 
" had neither time nor patience to decipher much of it." 

Should circumstances occur to render it highly probable 
that your attending a revision in England would eventually 
promote sales in both countries, or ensure a good price for 
the copy, the expense incurred by it might be more than 
compensated. As several years are still necessary to 
finish the work, and as occurrences may in the mean time 
create objections or afford facilities which cannot now be 
foreseen, the question, what posterior measures would be 
advisable, may probably be more easily answered at a future 
day than at present. 

Your intention to favour me with a visit next summer 
gives me pleasure. Whether our lives will be prolonged 
to that period, depends on that good Providence on which 
you happily and wisely rely, and whose beneficence I hope 
you will continue to experience. 

I am, sir, 
Your friend and obedient servant,

TO EDWARD LIVINGSTON. 

Bedford, 28th July, 1822. 
Sir, 

On the 20th inst. I received a copy of your report to the 
General Assembly of Louisiana, under a cover directed to 
me. To whom I am indebted for it, (\<>r< not appear ; the 
impression of the seal, which is that of your family, leads 
me to conjecture that you have had the g< >odness to send 
it. There are various important remarks and reflections 
in it which 1 believe to be just ; and there are others whose 
weight I cannot venture to estimate, without more thought 
and investigation than the state of my health admits of. 1 
will, however, take the liberty of suggesting a few hints on 
two of the topics. 

That the government of a State should have authority to 
appoint " particular days for rendering thanks to God" for 
any signal blessing, or imploring his assistance " in any pub- 
lic calamity," is certainly proper. But, can any of our gov- 
ernments be rightfully restrained from providing for the 
observance of the Sabbath, which the Sovereign of the uni- 
verse has instituted, and which our Saviour has assured us 
" was made for man ?" 

Again — Can any government be justifiable in exempting 
murderers from the punishment of death, in opposition to 
the positive declaration of the Almighty to Noah, and 
through him to all his posterity, that " whosoever sheddeth 
man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed ;" not, I pre- 
sume, at the discretion of private individuals, but under 
the cognizance and by the authority of government ? 

Accept my thanks for this mark of friendly attention. 

I am, sir. 
Your obliged and obedient servant, 

John Jay.

FROM GENERAL LAFAYETTE. 

Monticello, Nov. 10th, 1824. 

My dear Sir, 

As soon as I found myself once more on the happy shore 
of America, one of my first inquiries was after you, and 
the means to get to my old friend. The pleasure to see 
your son was great indeed ; but I regretted the distance, 
engagements, and duties which obliged me to postpone the 
high gratification to meet you after so long an absence. 
Since that time, I have been paying visits and receiving 
welcomes, where every sort of enjoyments and sights ex- 
ceeding my own sanguine expectations, have mingled with 
the feelings of a lively and profound gratitude. 

From you, my dear sir, and in the name of Congress, I 
was last honoured with a benevolent farewell. Now, I am 
going to Washington city, the constitutional forms having 
changed, to await the arrival of the members of the 
Houses, and be introduced to each of them, with my thanks 
for their kind invitation to this our American land. 

Your letter reached me on my way through a part of 
the States ; I wish I could myself bear the answer, or tell 
you when I can anticipate a visit to you : but waiting 
longer would not enable me to know it, at least, for some 
time. I therefore beg you to receive the grateful respects 
of my son, and the expression of most affectionate senti- 
ments from your old revolutionary companion and constant 
friend, 

Lafayette. 

to peter van schaack. 

Bedford, 23d Jan., 1827. 
Dear Sir, 

I have received your friendly letter of the 27th ult. It 

gives me pleasure to reflect that our mutual esteem and 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 127 

regard have, from an early period, been constantly produc- 
tive of cordiality and gratification. 

A kind Providence lias extended our lives to the com- 
mencement of another year. Very few of our early a - 
ciates remain with us. Our abode here is merely "pro 
hac vice," and our departure is then to place us in a suit'' of 
eternal good or evil. That good can only 1" ned by 

means of our merciful Redeemer, who was pleased to de- 
clare "without me, ye can do nothing." 

Although 1 have long been in a state of debility, yet it 
was lately so increased by an additional complaint, as 
caused me to delay preparing a few lines to you more 
seasonably. 

That you and your family may always be blessed with 
beneficial prosperity, be assured, is the wish of my chil- 
dren, and also 

Of your affectionate friend, 

John Jay. 



EXTRACTS 
FROM LETTERS OF JOHN JAY TO HIS CHILDREN. 

" I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 
1 5th of last month. It is natural that you should have 
more to say than would be prudent to write : I am glad 
you think so, and I hope it will occur to you whenever you 
begin to write a letter. It is better not to write, than to 
write what ought not to be written. Letters sometimes mis- 
carry ; and sometimes are inspected by persons whom we 
have no reason to trust : and sometimes our correspondents 
are less discreet and much more communicative than they 
should be; for all these reasons we should be cauti 
what we write, and reserve confidential matters for con- 
fidential conversation. Even in this, circumspection is 



428 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

necessary; for there are many persons who, although 
friendly and honourable, are in the habit of imprudently 
talking about any thing and every thing, to everybody and 
before anybody." 

" It was not quite prudent in you to mention a certain 
circumstance in your letter, in such explicit and strong 
terms. There is a wide difference between confiding sen- 
timents to me, and confiding sentiments to a letter to me. 
Letters not unfrequently miscarry, and are sometimes read 
by those for whose inspection they were not intended. 
Prudence is one of the cardinal virtues, and well deserves 
our constant attention. The longer we live, and observe 
what passes in the world, the more we become sensible of 
the value, and of the necessity of prudence. It is gener- 
ally acquired by experience, rather than by precept. Youth 
and experience cannot be old and intimate acquaintances. 
You have an advantage which few enjoy, and which many 
would not sufficiently estimate. I mean that of obtaining, 
upon every occasion, the advice and opinion of an affec- 
tionate, sincere, and judicious sister. They who think 
themselves superior to the necessity of advice and admo- 
nition, manifest more pride than judgment. This, I am 
happy to believe, will not be your case." 

" You do well to read Anacharsis ; it is proper you 
should have a general acquaintance with ancient and mod- 
ern history. I am not anxious that you should be what is 
called a ' learned lady ;' but it would mortify me to have 
any of my children classed with the ignorant and illiterate. 
I am particularly solicitous that they should be well versed 
in the science of living agreeably and comfortably here, and 
happily hereafter. The first includes whatever is taught 
by prudence, or common sense, and by the maxim ' never 
to buy any thing at too great a price,' whether it be pleas- 
ure, or riches, or ornaments. Hence it becomes necessary 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 129 

that we should endeavour to see persons and things as 
being what they really are, to estimate them at their true 
value, and to act accordingly. To do this effectually, self- 
command is absolutely indispensable. To look at objects 
through our passions, is like seeing through colound glass, 
which always paints what we view in its own, and not in 
the true colour. 

" These hints being very important, I recommend them 
to your consideration." 

" It was natural that the instance of ingratitude you 
mention should excite disagreeable emotions and reflections. 
There are, however, grateful persons in the world, but the 
number is, comparatively, inconsiderable. On this head, I 
have not been without experience. To many, the sense of 
obligation is painful ; and they gradually bring themselves 
to act accordingly : there are others who do not ascribe 
the good offices they receive to real generosity, but to their 
own importance. From frequently receiving what they 
conceive to be tribute to it, they, by little and little, increase 
their pretensions and their arrogance to an insufferable 
degree. 

" We should, nevertheless, proceed in doing good, be- 
cause it is our duty ; and not from the hope or expectation 
of grateful returns. Except in certain particular cases, it 
is better to ' cast our bread on the waters,' that is, on 
many ; here a little, and there a little, according to our 
abilities and opportunities, and leave the result to Provi- 
dence." 

" You have your troubles, my dear daughter, and I feel 
as well as observe them. But I comfort myself with the 
reflection, that they are permitted for wise and benevolent 
purposes ; and that these purposes include a rich reward 
to the sound mind, and the sound prineiples, on which 
those troubles operate as trials. Perfect wisdom and per- 



130 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

feet goodness, united with infinite power, form a perfect 
title to perfect trust and confidence. In such confidence, 
it is absolutely impossible for us to be mistaken or deceived. 
This is no visionary theory ; it is practical prudence and 
real common sense. 

" We cannot too frequently recollect, that if the Scrip- 
tures are true (and neither of us doubts it), it must also be 
true, that ' whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth.' Afflict- 
ing dispensations, therefore, are proofs of his love, and not 
of his displeasure. He sends them ' for our profit, that we 
might be partakers of his holiness ;' and although ' no 
chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but griev- 
ous, nevertheless, afterward, it yieldeth the peaceable fruit 
of righteousness unto them who are exercised thereby.' 
The Divine veracity can never be questionable." 

" Cheerfulness promotes health, and -health promotes 
cheerfulness. We are so formed, that when one part 
sutlers, the rest, whether corporeal or mental, are in a 
degree affected by it. Hence it is the more proper, that 
we should attend to every indisposition, and to whatever 
may aggravate or prolong it. By indulgence, both cheer- 
fulness and dejection will become habits, but of very 
different characters. They who neglect to cultivate the 
one and resist the other, are not wise. 

" Our religion, however serious from its objects and their 
importance, gives no countenance to habitual melancholy. 
The faitli, trust, gratitude, love, and joy which it inculcates, 
cannot be associated with such an inmate. Our religion 
not only permits, but directs us to rejoice ; and although it 
does not forbid occasional sorrow or grief, yet it marks the 
limits beyond which they are not to be indulged. Beyond 
those limits, they are temptations, and are to be treated 
accordingly. While prudential truths and principles re- 
main inactive in speculation, they are as unproductive as 
gold locked up in a miser's chest. Until used and em- 



MISCELLANEOUS CORRESPONDENCE. 131 

ployed, neither of them do any good. I rejoice that you 
not only have sound principles, but thai yon bring them into 
practice. Virtuous exertions arc never neglected by Provi- 
dence; and lam persuaded that yours will be blessed if 
you perse ver •. 

" It is not pleasant to be in affliction, nor in the rain; 
and yet both arc dispensed by the same benevolent hand; 
the one to produce medicine for spiritual maladies; the 
other to produce supplies for animal life. Many have said, 
and man}' will say with David, who was no stranger to 
distress, 'in very faithfulness hast thou afflicted me.'" 

" The lady you mention is much to be pitied ; especially 
if her melancholy be that which is called religious. 

" To me, nothing appears more strange and unaccount- 
able, than that a Christian should consider afflictions as 
evidence of Divine displeasure and dereliction. It is an 
error, against which our Redeemer seems to have taken 
particular care to guard us; not only by the parable of 
Lazarus and the rich man, but still more explicitly by as- 
suring us that God loves those whom he chastises, and that 
he chastises them because he loves them. On this point, 
various parts of Scripture, and particularly the Epistle to 
the Hebrew's, are conclusive. To the truth of this doc- 
trine, the lives and sufferings of the patriarchs, the prophets, 
the apostles, the martyrs, and of other good men in all 
times, bear positive and ample testimony. 

" If there be any temporal state or condition which 
more than others, affords reason for alarm and apprehen- 
sion, I think it is that of a long and uninterrupted course of 
worldly prosper ilij : for it is said, ' If ye be without chas- 
tisement, whereof all are partakers, then arc ye bastards, 
and not sons.' 

"Some are more ready to believe the denunciations 
against sin, than the declarations of mercy to sinners. 
Such persons should recollect, that if God was more in- 



432 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

clined to severity than to mercy, he would not have pro- 
vided for our redemption from misery, at the astonishing 
price which it cost. We have neither any reason, nor any 
right to question the sincerity with which ' the Lord our 
righteousness' has invited all men, without exception, to 
come to him, and drink of the waters of life freely. 

" It not unfrequently happens, however, that religious 
melancholy is produced, not by the ill state of our minds 
or consciences, but by the ill state of our health and nerves. 
In such cases, to cure the latter is to remove the former. 

" These and similar remarks are very common, and 
well known to you. I offer them, not because they are 
new or necessary, but because the subject led to them."

TO THE COUNT DE FLORIDA BLAN'CA. 

Madrid, April 25th, 1780. 

Sir, 

Mr. Carmichael has delivered to me a paper he had the 
honour of receiving from your excellency before my 
arrival here, containing heads of many important inquiries, 
respecting which it was thought necessary that his Catholic 
Majesty should be exactly informed, before entering into a 
discussion with me and Mr. Carmichael, jointly or sep- 
arately, on the subject of the affairs of the United States of 
North America, and their mutual interest with respect to 
Spain; but that the court, though desirous of information 
on these several articles, with all possible frankness and 
precision, did not mean to dive into matters which Mr. 
Carmichael and myself might regard as reserved to our- 
selves only. 

Being persuaded, that direct and accurate information 
respecting the nature and extent of the commissions given 
to that gentleman and myself, would be very agreeable to 
your excellency, I take the liberty of transmitting the toU 
lowing copies of each.

" The delegates of the United States of New-Hampshire, 
Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Providence Planta- 
tions, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, 
Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Caro- 
lina, and Georgia, in Congress assembled, to all who shall 
see these presents, Greeting. 

" Whereas, an intercourse between the subjects of his 
Catholic Majesty and the citizens of these United States, 
founded on the principles of equality, reciprocity, and 
friendship, may be of mutual advantage to both nations ; 
and it being the sincere desire of the United States to enter 
into a treaty of alliance, and of amity and commerce with 
his Catholic Majesty: Know Ye, therefore, that we, confiding 
in the integrity, prudence, and ability of the Honourable 
John Jay, late president of Congress, and Chief Justice of 
the State of New- York, have nominated and constituted, 
and by these presents do nominate and constitute him, the 
said John Jay, our minister plenipotentiary ; giving him 
full power, general and special, to act in that quality, to 
confer, treat, agree, and conclude with the ambassador or 
plenipotentiary of his Catholic Majesty vested with equal 
powers, of and concerning a treaty of amity and . com- 
merce, and of alliance ; and whatever shall be so agreed 
and concluded for us and in our names, to sign, and there- 
upon make such treaty or treaties, conventions and agree- 
ments, as he shall judge conformable to the ends we have 
in view, in as ample form, and with the same effect, as if 
we were personally present and acted therein; hereby 
promising in good faith, that we will accept, ratify, fulfil, 
and execute whatever shall be agreed, concluded, and 
signed by our said minister plenipotentiary ; and that we 
will never act, nor suffer any person to act, contrary to the 
same in the whole, or in any part.

be given in Congress, at Philadelphia, the 29th day of Sep- 
tember, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hun-

ents, constitute and appoint you, during our pleasure, sec- 
retary to our minister plenipotentiary, appointed to nego- 
tiate a treaty of amity and commerce, and of alliance with 
his Catholic Majesty. You are, therefore, carefully and 
diligently to discharge the duty of secretary, by doing and 
performing all things thereunto belonging ; and, in case of 
the death of our said minister, you are to signify it to us 
by the earliest opportunity, and on such event, we au- 
thorize and direct you to take into your charge all our 
public affairs, which were in the hands of said minister at 
the time of his death, or which may be addressed to him 
before notice thereof, and proceed therein, according to the 
instructions to our said minister given, until our further 
orders.

The inquiries in question are numerous and important. 
They do honour to the sagacity which suggested them, 
and. if fully answered, would produce a very interesting 
history of the present condition of the American States. 



438 LIFE OP JOHN JAY. 

On some of the subjects proposed, I can give your excel- 
lency full and positive intelligence ; on others, only general 
and by no means precise information. On all, however, I 
shall write with candour. 

Such is the nature of the American governments and 
confederacy, that the Congress, and all other rulers of the 
people, are responsible to them for their conduct; and can- 
not withhold from their constituents a knowledge of their 
true situation, without subjecting themselves to all the evils 
which they experience who substitute cunning in the place 
of wisdom. Hence it is, that a knowledge of their affairs 
is easily attainable by all who will be at the trouble of col- 
lecting it ; and as it is neither the policy nor inclination of 
America to draw a veil over any part of their affairs, your 
excellency may be persuaded, that every consideration 
forbids their servants, by a suppression or misrepresenta- 
tion of facts, to deceive or mislead those whose amity they 
so sincerely endeavour to cultivate, as they do that of 
Spain. 

I. THE CIVII, STATE OP NORTH AMERICA. 

Your excellency has, with great propriety, arranged the 
subjects of your inquiry under two heads ; the civil and 
military states of North America. The first of these is 
again branched into several subdivisions, at the head of 
which, is the 

Population of each State. 

The exact number of inhabitants in the United States 
has not, I believe, been ascertained by an actual census in 
more than two or three of them. The only computation 
made by Congress was on the 29th of July, 1775; the 
manner and occasion of which exclude every suspicion of 
its exceeding the true number. Congress had emitted bills 
of credit to a very considerable amount, and were apprized 
of the necessity of emitting more. Justice demanded that 



OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE. 139 

this debt should be apportioned among the States accord- 
ing to their respective abilities ; an equitable rule whereby 
to determine that ability became indispensable. After 
much consideration, Congress resolved, " that the propor- 
tion, or quota of each colony, should be determined accord- 
ing to the number of the inhabitants of all ages (including 
negroes and mulattoes) in each colony;"' but as that could 
not then be ascertained exactly, they were obliged to judge 
of, and compute the number from circumstantial evidence. 
The delegates gave to Congress an account of the popula- 
tion of their respective colonies, made from the best mate- 
rials then in their power ; and so great was their confidence 
in each other, that from those accounts that computation 
was principally formed. Your excellency will readily per- 
ceive, that the delegates were far from being under any 
temptations to exaggerate the number of their constituents ; 
they were not ignorant, that by such exaggerations they 
would increase their portion of aids, both of men and 
money, and that whatever errors they might commit, could 
not be rectified by an aetual numeration during the war. 
The computation then formed was as follows: — 

Xew-Hampshire .... 124,069 and a half 

Massachusetts Bay . . . 434,2 i 1 

Rhode Island 71,959 and a half 

Connecticut 248,139 

New- York 248,139 

New-Jersey 161,29(1 and a half 

Pennsylvania 372,208 and a half

Exclusive of the inhabitants of Georgia, who were not at 
that time represented in Congress, and of whose numbers I 
have no information that I can confide in. 

The Form of Government, of each, State. 

In the pamphlets I have now the honour of transmitting 
to your excellency, viz. No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, and 
No. 5, you will find the constitutions of New- York, New- 
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and South Carolina. The 
others I have not with me. The great outlines of them all 
are very similar. By the last accounts from America, it 
appears that Massachusetts Bay had not as yet agreed 
upon their constitution, but had it then under consideration. 

It cannot be necessary to observe to your excellency, 
that these new modes of government were formed by per- 
sons named and authorized by the people for that express 
purpose ; that they were, in general, instituted with great 
temper and deliberation, upon such just and liberal princi- 
ples, as, on the one hand, to give effectual security to civil 
and religious liberty ; and, on the other, make ample pro- 
vision for the rights of justice, and the due exercise of the 
necessary powers of government. 

The articles of confederation agreed upon by Congress, 
and approved by every State in the Union except Mary- 
land, provide for the general government of the confeder- 
acy, and the ordering of all matters essential to the pros- 
perity and preservation of the Union in peace and war. I 
ought also to inform your excellency, that the reasons why 
Maryland has as yet withheld her assent to those articles, 
do not arise from any disaffection to the common cause, but 
merely from their not having adopted certain principles 
respecting the disposition of certain lands. 

The union and resolution of the inhabitants to continue the 
war with vigour as long as may be necessary. 

On this subject, I can give your excellency certain and

positive information; tin- storm of tyranny and oppression, 
which had for some years been constantly growing more 
black and more terrible, began* to burst with violence on 
the people of North America in the year l'<~ !. It was 
seen and felt and deprecated by all, except those who 
pected to gather spoils in the ruins it v. d to occa- 

sion. These were those who enjoyed, or expected emolu- 
ments from Great Britain, together with their immediate 
dependants and connexions; such as tin- officers of govern- 
ment throughout the colonies, hut with s< ery distin- 
guished exceptions; tiiose of the clergy of the church of 
England almost without exception, who received annual 
salaries from the society established in England for Pri 
gating the Gospel in Foreign Paris; foreign adventurers, 
buyers and sellers, who, being no further attached to the 
country than as it afforded the means of gain, soon pre- 
pared to speculate in confiscations, and courted the notice 
of their sovereign by intemperate zeal for the ruin of his 
subjects. With these exceptions, the I body of the 
people moved together, and united in such firm and con- 
siderate measures for the common safety, and conducted 
their affairs with such regularity, order, and system, as to 
leave no room to suppose them to be the work of only a 
prevailing party, as our enemies have always represented 
and affected to consider them. 

There was, it is true, another class of persons not much 
less dangerous, though far more contemptible than those I 
first mentioned; persons who. in vmt,- revolution, like 
floating weeds in every storm, obey the str I wind, 

and pass from side to side as that happens to c I 

mean the neutrals, a pusillanimous race,v ho, having ! alanced 
in their minds the advantages and disadvantages, the gains 
and dangers of joining either side, are se I by their 
fears to form a thousand pretexts for joining neither; who, 
to manifest their loyalty to their king, when his armies 
were successful, gave them every aid in their power, ex-

cept drawing their swords against their country ; and who, 
when their countrymen prevailed, were ready to render 
them all possible service, except taking arms against their 
prince. 

The auxiliaries, whom the British measures and forces 
found in the country, consisted of persons from these 
classes. And although when these first appeared in, and 
wounded the bosom of America, she was obliged to extend 
her arms to repel the assaults of a foreign enemy, yet such 
was the union and spirit of her inhabitants, that she was 
soon enabled not only to put them under her feet, but on 
the ruins of her former governments to erect new ones in 
the midst of invasions from without, and treacherous com- 
binations from within. Being able to obtain no other terms 
of peace than unconditional obedience, she had sufficient 
courage to declare herself independent in the face of one 
of the best appointed armies Britain could ever boast of; 
as well as sufficient strength to limit its operations, and 
reduce its numbers. 

It may perhaps be observed, that the first object of the 
war was a redress of grievances ; that the present object is 
independence ; and it may be asked whether the people are 
as much united with respect to the last as they w r ere with 
respect to the first. 

I am certain that the people of America never were so 
well united as they are at present, in that of their independ- 
ence. Exclusive of actual observation on the spot, I think 
so because, 

1st. The Declaration of Independence was made by 
Congress at a time when the great body of their constituents 
called for it. 

2dly. Because that declaration was immediately recog- 
nised by the general assemblies and legislatures of the 
several States, without exception. 

3dly. Because the successful army under General Bur- 
goyne was defeated and captured by a great collection of 



OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE. 113 

the neighbouring militia, to whom ho had offered pence and 
tranquillity on their remaining at home; tonus which it 
was natural to suppos< a great many of them would have 
accepted, had the Declaration of Independence been 

agreeable to them. 

-lthly. Because the Congress, consisting of members an- 
nually elected, have repeatedly, expressly, and unanimo 
declared their determination to support it at every hazard. 

5thly. Because their internal enemies have been either 
expelled or reduced, and their estates, t<> a very great 
amount in some of the States, confiscated and actually 
sold. 

6thly. Because constitutions and forms of government 
have since been instituted and completely organized, in 
which the people participate, from which they have expe- 
rienced essential advantages, and to which they have of 
consequence become greatly attached. 

7thly. Because Congress unanimously refused to enter 
into treaty with the British commissioners on any terms 
short of independence ; and because every State, though 
afterward separately solicited, refused to treat otherwise 
than collectively by their delegates in Congress. 

Sthly. Because the inhuman and very barbarous manner 
in which the war has been conducted by the enemv, has so 
alienated the affections of the people from the king and 
government of Britain, and filled their hearts with such 
deep-rooted and just resentments, as render a cordial 
reconciliation, much less a dependence on them, utterly 
impossible. 

9thly. Because the doctrine propagated in America by 
the servants of the King of Great Britain, that no faith was 
to be kept with Americans in arms against him. and the 
uniformity with which they have adhered to it, in their 
practice as well as professions, have destroyed all confi- 
dence, and leave the Americans no room to doubt but that, 
should they again become subjects of the King of Britain

on certain terms, those terms would as little impede the 
progress of future oppression, as the capitulation of Lim- 
erick, in 1G91, did with respect to Ireland. 

lOthly. Because the treaty with France, and conse- 
quently virtue, honour, and every obligation due to the 
reputation of a rising nation, whose fame is unsullied by 
violated compacts, forbid it. 

llthly. Because it is the evident and well-known inter- 
est of North America to remain independent. 

12thly. Because the history of mankind, from the earliest 
ages, with a loud voice calls upon those who draw their 
swords against a prince, deaf to the supplication of his 
people, to throw away the scabbard. 

13thly. Because they do not consider the support of 
their independence as difficult. The country is very de- 
fensible and fertile ; the people are all soldiers, who with 
reason consider their liberty and lives as the most valuable 
of the possessions left them, and which they are determined 
shall neither be wrested nor purchased from them but with 
blood. 

14thly. Because, for the support of their independence, 
they have expressly, by a most solemn act, pledged to each 
other their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honour ; so 
that their bond of union, for this very purpose, thus formed 
of all the ties of common interest, common safety, mutual 
affection, general resentments, and the great obligations of 
virtue, honour, patriotism, and religion, may with reason 
be deemed equal to the importance of that great object. 

Whether tliere is any ■powerful party in favour of England, 
and what consequences are to be apprehended from it? 
Whether the heads of -this party suffer themselves to be 
seduced by the promises of the British Government? 

What has been already said on the subject of the union 
of the people in North America will, I imagine, in a great 
measure, answer these questions. . 



OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE. 1 I S 

If by a party in favour of England is meant a party for 
relinquishing the independence of the United States, and 
returning to the dominion of Britain, on any terms what- 
ever, I answer, there is no such party in North America ; 
all the open adherents of the crown of Great Britain hav- 
ing either voluntarily quitted or been expelled from the 
country. 

That Britain has emissaries and masked adherents in 
America, industrious in their little spheres to perplex the 
public measures, and disturb the public tranquillity, is a 
fact of which I have not the most distant doubt ; and it is 
equally true, that some of these wicked men are by a f-w 
weak ones thought to be patriots, but they cannot with any 
propriety be called a party, or even a faction. The chief 
mischief thev do, is collectimr and transmitting intelligence, 
raising false reports, and spreading calumnies of public 
men and measures; such characters will be found in every 
country so circumstanced, and America has not been neg- 
ligent in providing laws for their punishment. 

The obvious policy of the court of London has induced 
them to boast perpetually of their party in America ; but 
where is it? of whom composed? what has it done, or is 
doing ? are questions to which they constantly give evasive 
answers. Much also have they said of the numbers that 
have joined their arms in America. The truth is, that at 
Boston, Rhode Island, New-York, and Philadelphia, they 
gleaned some of that refuse of mankind to be found and 
purchased by anybody in all commercial cities. It is also 
true, that some men of weight and influence in the coun- 
try, who joined the enemy on their first successes, did draw 
away with them several of their immediate dependants, 
whom they persuaded or otherwise influenced to enlist in 
their service. To these may also be added the prisoners, 
who at different times they forced into their service by 
famine, and other severities too numerous as well as bar- 
barous to be here particularized. But I have no reason to 



446 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

believe, that all these aids put together ever exceeded three 
thousand men. This business, however (except with respect 
to prisoners), has long been over, and before I left America, 
many of those deluded people had returned and implored 
the pardon of their country. 

In America, as in all other popular governments, your 
excellency knows there must and ever will be parties for 
and against particular measures and particular men. The 
enemy, adverting to this circumstance, have had address 
enough to ascribe differences and temporary heats arising 
from this source, in which they were not interested, to 
causes much higher, and more flattering to their import- 
ance ; and this they have done with so much art, as to 
have imposed in some instances on the credulity of men 
high in reputation for sagacity and discernment. 

If your excellency will be pleased to peruse a pamphlet 
marked No. 6, which you will find enclosed with the other 
papers I herewith transmit, and entitled " Observations on 
the American Revolution," you will perceive that nothing 
is to be apprehended from this supposed party in North 
America. 

A statement of the revenues of the States, and of their ability 
to contribute to the general expense ; whether they will be 
able long to support tins burden, and increase it if neces- 
sary. 

The confederated States have no fixed revenues, nor are 
such revenues necessary, because all the private property 
in the country is at the public service. The only restric- 
tion imposed by the people is, that it be taken from them 
with wisdom and justice : or, to be more explicit, that the 
sums required be proportionate to the public exigences, and 
assessed on the individuals in proportion to their respective 
abilities. 

A nation can seldom be destitute of the means of con- 
tinuing a war, while they remain unsubdued in the field,

and cheerfully devote their all to that service. The}- may 
indeed experience greal distress, but no distress being equal 
to that of subjection to exasperated oppr< . whose most 

tender mercies are cruel, the Americans had little difficulty 

in making their election. 

A statement of the public debts. 

This subject your excellency will find fully discussed in 
an address of Congress to their constituents, in which they 
compute their debts, and mention the means they had taken 
to preserve the public credit. It is also herewith enclosed, 
and marked No. 7. 

A statement of the debts of each particular State. 

Although exact accounts of these debts are contained in 
the public printed acts of each State, yet as I neither have 
any of those acts or extracts from them with me, and my 
general knowledge on this head is very in, \ I am 

deterred from giving your excellency any information re- 
specting it, by the very great risk I should run of mislead- 
ing you on this point. 

The resources to lessen these debts. 

Taxes ; foreign and domestic loans ; sales of confiscated 
estates, and unsrranted lands. 



o 



The possibility of their supporting tin ir credit in all the 
operations of government, in the commerce of their in- 
habitants, ami, above all, in the protection of national 
industry. 

As to the possibility of supporting their credit in the 
cases mentioned, there is no doubt it is very possible. 1 low 
far it is probable, is a question less easy to answer. If the 
taxes called for by Congress last fall be duly paid, all will 
be safe. But whether they have been paid or not I am 
wholly uninformed, except that I find in a public paper that 



448 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

Virginia had made good her first payment. As I daily 
expect to receive advices from America on this subject, I 
shall postpone saying any thing further on it at present ; 
but your excellency may rely on my communicating to you 
a full state of what intelligence I may have respecting it. 

As to supporting their credit in commerce, it is attended 
with considerable, though not insurmountable difficulties. 
They are of two kinds, the want of sufficient commodities 
for remittances, and the risk of transporting them. North 
America abounds in valuable commodities, such as fish, oil, 
lumber, provisions of flesh and corn, iron, tobacco, and 
naval stores, peltry, indigo, potash, and other articles, all of 
which have greatly diminished since the war ; the labour- 
ers formerly employed in producing them having been 
often called to the field, and by other effects of the war 
been prevented from regularly following their usual occu- 
pations. Of some of these articles, America still produces 
more than is necessary for her own consumption, but the 
risk of transporting them to Europe renders her remittances 
very uncertain. The asylum, which all British armed ves- 
sels find in the ports of Portugal, enables them to cruise 
very conveniently and with great advantage off the west- 
ern islands, and other situations proper for annoying vessels 
from thence to France, Spain, or the Mediterranean. 
Hence it is that the trade from America to St. Eustatia 
has of late so greatly increased, it being carried on prin- 
cipally in small, fast, sailing vessels, that draw but little 
water, and that the chief remittances to Europe have been 
in bills of exchange instead of produce. 

With respect to the protection of national industry, I 
take it for granted that it will always nourish where it is 
lucrative and not discouraged, which was the case in 
North America when I left it : every man being then at 
liberty, by the law, to cultivate the earth as he pleased, to 
raise what he pleased, to manufacture as he pleased, and to 
sell the produce of his labour to whom he pleased, and for 



01 FICIAL CORRESPONDED I [Q 

the best prices, without any duties or impositions whatsoever. 
I have indeed no apprehensions whatever on this subj 

I believe there arc no people more industrious than th 
of America, and whoever recurs to their population, their 
former exports, and their present productions amid the hor- 
rors of lire and sword, will be convinced of it. 

By what means, or what branches of commen . will the 
States of America have it in their power to indemt 
Spain, whi m ver this power may second the views and 
operations of the Americans? 

America will indemnify Spain in two ways, by fighting 
the enemy of Spain, and by commerce. Your excellency 
will be pleased to remark, that Spain as well as America is 
now at war with Britain, and therefore that it is the inter- 
est of both to support and assist each other against the 
common enemy. It cannot be a question whether Britain 
will be more or less formidable if del d or victorious in 
America; and there can be no doubt but that every nation, 
interested in the reduction of her power, will be com] 
sated for any aids they may afford America, by the imi - 
diate application of those aids to that express purpose at 
the expense of American blood. 

Your excellency's well known talents save me the neces- 
sity of observing, that it is the interest of all Europe to join 
in breaking down the exorbitant power of a nation which 
arrogantly claims the ocean as her birthright, and considers 
every advantage in commerce, however acquired by vio- 
lence, or used with cruelty, as a tribute justly due to her 
boasted superiority in arts and in am 

By establishing the indepi erica, the empire 

of Britain will be divided, and the sinews of her power 
cut. Americans, situated in another hemisphere, intent 
only on the cultivation of a country more than sufficient to 
satisfy their desires, will remain unconnected withEuropean 
politics, and not being interested in their objects, will not

450 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

partake in their dissensions. Happy in having for their 
neighbours a people distinguished for love of justice and of 
peace, they Mall have nothing to fear, but may flatter them- 
selves that they and their posterity will long enjoy all the 
blessings of that peace, liberty, and safety, for which alone 
they patiently endure the calamities incident to the cruel 
contest they sustain. 

While the war continues, the commerce of America will 
be inconsiderable ; but on the restoration of peace it will 
soon become very valuable and extensive. So great is the 
extent of country in North America yet to be cultivated, 
and so inviting to settlers, that labour will very long remain 
too dear to admit of considerable manufactures. Reason 
and experience tell us, that when the poor have it in their 
power to gain affluence by tilling the earth, they will refuse 
the scanty earnings which manufacturers may offer them. 
From this circumstance it is evident, that the exports from 
America will consist of raw materials, which other nations 
will be able to manufacture for them at a cheaper rate than 
they can themselves. To those who consider the future 
and progressive population of that country, the demands it 
will have for the manufactures and productions of Europe, 
as well to satisfy their wants as to gratify their luxury, will 
appear immense, and far more than any one kingdom in it 
can supply. Instead of paying money for fish and many 
other articles as heretofore, Spain will then have an oppor- 
tunity of obtaining them in exchange for her cloths, silks, 
wines, and fruits ; notwithstanding which, it is proper to 
observe, that the commerce of the American States will 
for ever procure them such actual wealth as to enable them 
punctually to repay whatever sums they may borrow. 



OFFICIAL CORUESPONDKNI K. -]7,\ 

How for it may be convenient for these States /<> furnish 
ships of war, timber, and other articles for the king's 
arsenals, without delay; and, if in their power, on what 
terms ! 

I am much at a loss to determine at present, and there- 
fore will by no means give your excellency my conjccte 
for intelligence. 

It is certain, that in ordinary times, An rica can build 
ships as good, and cheaper than any other people, because 
the materials cost them less. The ships of war now in her 
service, as to strength and construction, are not exceeded 
by any on the ocean. On this subject I will write to 
America for information, and give your excellency the 
earliest notice of it. Naval stores, and particularly masts 
and spars, may certainly be had there, and of the best 
quality; and I doubt not but that the Americans would 
carry them to the Ilavannah or New-( >rleans, though I 
suspect, their being in a manner destitute of proper Con- 
voys for the European trade, would render them backward 
in bringing them to Spain, on terms equal to the risk of 
capture on the one hand, ami tin.' expectations of pur- 
chasers on the other. 

II. THE MILITARY STATE OF NORTH AMERICA. 

The number ami strength of the American troops, their 

■present situation, and ability to oppose the enemy, espe- 
cially in Georgia and Carolina. 

Six months have elapsed since I left America, and I had 
not seen a return of the army for some time before that 
period. It did not, I am certain, amount to its full com] - 
ment, and, in my opinion, did not in the whole exceed thirty 
or thirty-five thousand men; I mean regular troops. 

The commander-in-chief, whose abilities, as well as in- 
tegrity, merit the highest confidence, was authorized to 
conduct all the military operations in the United States at 



452 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

his -discretion ; subject, nevertheless, to such orders as the 
Congress might think proper from time to time to give. It 
is impossible, therefore, for me (not having received a 
single letter from America on these subjects since my ar- 
rival) to decide in what manner or proportions these troops 
are employed or stationed, though I am confident it has 
been done in the best manner. 

All the men of proper age in America are liable to do 
military duty in certain cases, and with a few exceptions, 
in all cases. The militia is for the most part divided into a 
certain number of classes, and whenever reinforcements to 
the main army, or any detachment of it, are wanting, they 
are supplied by these classes in rotation. These reinforce- 
ments, while in the field, are subject to the like regulations 
with the regular troops, and with them submit to the 
severest discipline and duty. Hence it is, that the people 
of America have become soldiers, and that the enemy have 
never been able to make a deep impression in the country, 
or long hold any considerable lodgments at a distance from 
their fleets. Georgia and South Carolina, indeed, enjoy 
these advantages in a less degree than the other States, 
their own militia not being very numerous, and speedy re- 
inforcements from their neighbours of North Carolina and 
Virginia rendered difficult by the length of the way. 
They have, nevertheless, given proofs of their spirit by 
various and great exertions ; and I have reason to believe, 
that all possible care has been taken to provide for their 
safety, by furnishing them with a proper body of troops 
under Major General Lincoln, a very good officer, as well 
as a very good man. 

Arms are still wanting in America, many of those im- 
ported proving unfit for use, and the number of inhabitants 
who were without proper arms at the beginning of the 
war, calling for great supplies. The army, and a consid- 
erable part of the militia, especially in the Northern States, 
have in general good arms. 



official < o!!i:r>po\F>r.\< i . 4r»3 

The article of clothing has been, and still is, a very in- 
teresting one to the American army. It is impossible to 
describe, and, indeed, almost impossible to believe, the 
hardships they have endured for want of it. There have 
been instances, and 1 speak from the most undoubted au- 
thority, of considerable detachments marching barefo< 
over rugged tracts of ice and snow, and marking the route 
they took by the Mood that i from their feet; but 

neither these terrible extremities, nor the alluring offer 
the enemy, could prevail on them to quit their standard or 
relax their ardour. Their condition, however, has of late 
been much bettered by supplies from France and Spain, 
and American privateers: bul adequate provision has not 
yet been made for the ensuing winter, and I cannot conceal 
from your excellency my anxiety on that head. A supply 
of clothing for twenty thousand men, added to what is i n- 
carred for them in France, would make that army and all 
America happy. 

I foresee no other difficulties in providing subsistence for 
the American armies in ever) station in which they may 
be placed, than those which may attend the transportation 
of it. But when I reflect on the obstacles of this kind 
which they have already met with and surmounted, I have 
little uneasiness about future ones. The last crops in 
America promised to be plentiful when I left it, but whether 
there would be any and what considerable overplus for ex- 
portation, was then undetermined : the damages done the 
wheat in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina by a fly, 
which infested those countries, not being to my knowl< 
at that time ascertained. 

How many ships of war belong to Congri i ques- 

tion I cannot answer with certainty. I think there are nol 
more than ten or twelve in the whole. Of private* 
there arc a great number, but how man}" exactly has not 
been computed. In my opinion, they exceed one hundred, 
several of them very fine ships. The Governor of Mar- 



454 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

tinique told me, that in that island alone, the American pri- 
vateers had brought and sold above five thousand African 
slaves, which they had taken from the enemy. Nine-tenths 
at least of all the rum and sugar used in North America, 
these three years past, have been obtained in the same way, 
and to their successes have the public been indebted for the 
most seasonable and valuable supplies of military stores 
which they have received. I left several vessels on the 
stocks at Philadelphia, -and heard of more in other parts. 

Upon the whole, his majesty may rest perfectly assured, 
that the Americans are determined, though forsaken by all 
mankind, to maintain their independence, and to part with it 
only with their lives ; the desolations and distresses of war 
being too familiar to them to excite any other passions than 
indignation and resentment. 

That the country will supply its inhabitants with provis- 
ions, some clothing, and some articles of commerce. 

That there is no party in America in favour of returning 
under the dominion of Britain, on any terms whatever. 

That the King of France is very popular in America, 
being in all parts of it styled the protector of the rights of 
mankind, and that they will hold the treaty made with him 
inviolate. 

That the people in America have very high ideas of the 
honour and integrity of the Spanish nation, and of his 
Catholic Majesty especially, and that this respect and 
esteem unite with their interest in rendering them so desir- 
ous of his friendship and alliance. 

That the greatest difficulty under which America labours 
arises from the great depreciation of her bills of credit, 
owing principally to a greater sum having been emitted 
than was necessary for a medium of commerce, and to the 
impossibility of remedying it by taxes before regular gov- 
ernments are established. 

That great attempts, seconded by the general voice of 
the people, have been made to retrieve the credit of those 



OFFICIAL CORRESPONDED I . 155 

bills by taxation, the issue of which was as yel uncertain, 
but if unsuccessful, a recurrence to taxes in kind was still 
left, and would be practised, though it is an expedient 
which nothing but necessity can render eligibl . 

That it France ami Spain were to unite their endeavours 
to conquer Britain in America, by furnishing the latter with 
the necessary aids of ammunition, clothing, and some 
money, there is reason to believe, that the House of Bour- 
bon would find it the most certain and least expensive 
method of reducing the power of their irreconcUeable 
enemy, and not only command the gratitude and perpetual 
attachment of America, but the general approbation of all 
who wish well to the tranquillity of Europe, and the rights 
of mankind. Thus would that illustrious house erect 
glorious and lasting monuments to their virtues in the hearts 

Of a whole people. 

I fear your excellency will consider the intelligence here 
given less full and precise than you expected. I regret 
that it is not in my power to render it more so, but it is 
not. I hope, however, it will be thoughl sufficient to open 
a way to those further discussions which must precede the 
measures necessary to bind America to Spain, as well as 
to France, and thereby complete the division, and conse- 
quently the humiliation of the British empire ; a work too 
glorious and laudable not to merit the notice of so mag- 
nanimous a prince as his majesty, and engage the attention 
of a minister of such acknowledged abilities as your ex- 
cellency. 

I flatter myself that the importance of the subject will 
apologize for my trespassing so long on your excellency's 
patience so soon after your return to Aranjuez. 
I have the honour to be, &c. 

John Jay. 



456 LIFE OF JOHN JAY, 



TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Secretary for Foreign Affairs. 

Paris, November 17th, 1782. 

Dear Sir, 

Although it is uncertain when I shall have an opportunity 
either of finishing or transmitting the long particular letter, 
which I am now undertaking to write, I think the matter it 
will contain is too interesting to rest only in my memory, 
of in short notes, which nobody but myself can well unfold 
the meaning of. I shall, therefore, write on as my health 
will permit, and when finished, shall convey this letter by 
the first prudent American that may go from hence to 
Nantes or L'Orient. 

My reception here was as friendly as an American min- 
ister might expect from this polite and politic court ; for I 
think they deceive themselves, who suppose that these kinds 
of attentions are equally paid to their private as to their 
public characters. 

Soon after the enabling act was passed, I was shown a 
copy of it, and I confess it abated the expectations I had 
formed of the intention of the British ministry to treat in a 
manly manner with the United States, on the footing of an 
unconditional acknowledgment of their independence. The 
act appeared to me to be cautiously framed to elude such 
an acknowledgment, and, therefore, it would depend on 
future contingencies, and on the terms and nature of the 
bargain they might be able to make with us. 

On the 25th of July, 1782, the king of Great Britain 
issued a warrant,* or order, directed to his attorney or 
solicitor-general. 

A copy of this warrant was sent by express to Mr. 



' This warrant directed the solicitor-general to prepare a commission for 
Mr. Oswald, authorizing him to treat with any person or persons appointed 
by all, or any of the American colonies, &c. 



OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENT I'. l.'.T 

Oswald, with an assurance that the commission should be 
completed and senthim in a few day-. He communicated 
this paper to Dr. Franklin, who,after showing it to n . 
it to the Count de Vergennes. The count wrote to the 
doctor the following letter on the subj< 

TRANSLATION. 

" I have received, sir, the letter of to-day, with which you 
have honoured me, and the copy of the powers which Mr. 
Oswald communicated to you. The form in which it is 
conceived not bein^ that which is usual, I cannot form my 
opinion on the first view of it. I am going to examine it 
with the greatest attention, and if you will be pleased to 
come here on Saturday morning, I shall be able to c infer 
about it with you and Mr. Jay, if it should be convenient 
for him to accompany you. 

" I have the honour to be, &c. 

" De Vr.uou.NM -. 

" Versailles, August 8th, 1782." 

On the 10th of August, we waited upon the Count de 
Vergennes, and a conference between him and us, on the 
subject of Mr. Oswald's commission, ensued. 

The count declared his opinion, that we might proceed 
to treat with Mr. Oswald under it, as soon as the original 
should arrive. He said it was such a one as we might h. 
expected it would be, but that we must take care to insert 
proper articles in the treaty, to secure our independence 
and our limits against all future claims. 

I observed to the count, that it would be descending from 
the ground of independence, to treat under the description 
of colonies. He replied, that names signified little; that 
the king of Great Britain's styling himself the king i »f I 
was no obstacle to the king of France's treating with him ; 
that an acknowledgment of our independent . stead of 
preceding, must, in the natural course of things, be the effect 

\ OL. II. M M M 



458 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

of the treaty, and that it would not be reasonable to expect 
the effect before the cause. He added, that we must be 
mindful to exchange powers with Mr. Oswald, for that his 
acceptance of our powers, in which we were styled Com- 
missioners from the United States of America, would be a 
tacit admittance of our independence. I made but little 
reply to all this singular reasoning. The count turned to 
Dr. Franklin, and asked him what he thought of the matter. 
The doctor said, he believed the commission would do. 
He next asked my opinion. I told him that I did not like 
it, and that it was best to proceed cautiously. 

On returning, I could not forbear observing to Dr. Frank- 
lin, that it was evident the count did not wish to see our 
independence acknowledged by Britain, until they had made 
all their uses of us. It was easy for them to foresee diffi- 
culties in bringing Spain into a peace on moderate terms, 
and that if we once found ourselves standing on our own 
legs, our independence acknowledged, and all our other 
terms ready to be granted, we might not think it our duty 
to continue in the war for the attainment of Spanish objects. 
But, on the contrary, as we were bound by treaty to con- 
tinue the war till our independence should be attained, it 
was the interest of France to postpone that event, until 
their own views and those of Spain could be gratified by a 
peace, and that I could not otherwise account for the min- 
ister's advising us to act in a manner inconsistent with our 
dignity, and for reasons which he himself had too much 
understanding not to see the fallacy of. 

The doctor imputed this conduct to the moderation of 
the minister, and to his desire of removing every obstacle 
to speedy negotiations for peace. He observed, that this 
court had hitherto treated us very fairly, and that suspicions 
to their disadvantage should not be readily entertained. 
He also mentioned our instructions, as further reasons for 
our acquiescence in the advice and opinion of the minister. 
A day or two afterward I paid a visit to Mr. Oswald, and

"June 2;")///, 1782. — It has been said, that ' greal efli ■ 
might be obtained by something being done 
from England." Upon this and other considei . his 

majesty has been induced to give a striking proof ol 
royal magnanimity and disinterested wish for tl 
tion of peace, by commanding his m s to 

direct Mr. Grenville, that //!>■ ind<

it the condition of a general peac . 

" I have given a confidential information to you of th 
particulars, that you may take such measure- as shall ap- 
pear to you most advisable for making a dh mmuni- 
cation of the substance of the same, either immediately to

ness and liberality of his i - in such great 
and spontaneous concessions.

100 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

on the contrary, may be in future manifestly injurious to the 
interests of America herself. 

" That if the negotiation is broken off, it will undoubtedly 
be for the sake of those powers, and not America, whose 
object is accomplished the instant she accepts of an inde- 
pendence, which is not merely held out to her in the way 
of negotiation by the executive power, but a distinct un- 
conditional offer, arising out of the resolutions of Parlia- 
ment, and therefore warranted by the sense of the nation 
at large. 

" These facts being made notorious, it is scarce conceiv- 
able that America, composed as she is, will continue efforts 
under French direction, and protract the distresses and 
calamities which it is well known that war has subjected 
her to. It is to be presumed, that from that moment she 
will look with jealousy on the French troops in that country, 
who may from allies become dangerous enemies. 

" If, however, any particular States, men, or description 
of men, should continue, against the general inclination of 
the continent, devoted to France, this communication will 
surely detect their views, expose their motives, and deprive 
them of their influence in all matters of general concern 
and exertion. You will, however, take particular care in 
your manner of conducting yourselves, not only that there 
should not be the smallest room for suspicions of our good 
faith and sincerity, but that we have no view in it of caus- 
ing dissensions among the colonies, or even of separating 
America from France upon terms inconsistent with her 
own honour. You must therefore convince them, that the 
great object of this country is, not merely peace, but recon- 
ciliation with America on the noblest terms and by the 
noblest means." 

In the course of the beforementioned conversation with 
Mr. Oswald, I reminded him, that the judgment and opinion 
of America respecting the disposition and views of Britain 



OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENT E. \<\] 

towards her, must be determined by facts and not by pro- 
fessions. That the Enabling Act, and the commission 
granted to him in pursuance of it, by no means harmoni 
with the language of these instructions to Sir Guy Carleton. 
That unless the ofiers and promises contained in the latter 
were realized, by an immediate declaration of our indepen- 
dence, America would naturally consider them as specious 
appearances of magnanimity, calculated to deceive and 
disunite them, and, instead of conciliating, would tend to 
irritate the States. I also urged, in the strongest terms, the 
great impropriety, and consequently the utter impossibility 
of our ever treating with Great Britain on any other than 
an equal footing, and told him plainly, that I would have no 
concern in any negotiation in which we were nol consid- 
ered as an independent people. 

Mr. Oswald upon this, as upon every other occasion, 
behaved in a candid and proper manner. He saw and 
confessed the propriety of these remarks; he wished his 
commission had been otherwise, but was at a loss how to 
reconcile it to the king's dignity, to make such a declara- 
tion, immediately after having issued such a commission. 
I pointed out the manner in which I conceived it might be 
done ; he liked the thought, and desired me to reduce' it to 
writing. I did so, and communicated it to Dr. Franklin, 
and, as we corrected it, is as follows, viz. 

"George III., &c. to Richard Oswald, greeting. Where- 
as, by a certain act, &c. (here follows the Enabling Act). 

" And whereas, in pursuance of the true intent and mean- 
ing of the said act, and to remove all doubts and jealou 
which might otherwise retard the execution of the same, 
we did, on the day of instruct Sir Guy Carle- 

ton, &c. our general, &c. to make known to the people of 
the said colonies, in Congress assembled, our royal disposi- 
tion and intention to recognise the said colonies as indepen- 
dent States, and as such, to enter with them into such a 



462 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

treaty of peace as might be honourable and convenient to 
both countries. 

" And whereas further, in pursuance of the said act, we 
did on the day of authorise and commission you, 

the said Richard Oswald (here follows the commission). 
Now, therefore, to the end that a period may be put to the 
calamities of war ; and peace, commerce, and mutual inter- 
course the more speedily restored, we do hereby, in pursu- 
ance of our royal word, for ourselves and our successors, 
recognise the said thirteen colonies as free and independent 
States. And it is our will and pleasure, that you do forth- 
with proceed to treat with the commissioner or commis- 
sioners already appointed, or to be appointed for that 
purpose by the Congress of the said States, and, with him 
or them only, of and concerning the objects of your said 
commission, which we do hereby confirm, and that this 
declaration be considered by you as a preliminary article to 
the proposed treaty, and be in substance or in the whole 
inserted therein, or incorporated therewith. And it is our 
further will and pleasure, that, on receiving these presents, 
which we have caused to be made patent, and our great 
seal to be hereunto affixed, you do deliver the same to the 
said commissioner or commissioners, to be by him or them 
transmitted to the Congress of the United States of America, 
as an earnest of the friendship and good-will which we are 
disposed to extend to them. Witness, &c. 15th of Au- 
gust, 1782." 

Mr. Oswald approved of the draught, and said he would 
recommend the measure to the minister. The next day, 
however, he told me that he had an instruction, which he 
thought enabled him to make the declaration ; but that it 
would be necessary to obtain the previous consent of the 
minister for that purpose. He then read to me the fourth 
article of his instructions, of which the following is a copy, 
viz. 



OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENT E. 4C3 

"Incase you find the American commissio 
at liberty to treat on any terms shorl of independence, ; 
are to declare to them, thai you have our authority to make 
that cession; our ardent wish for peace disposing us to pur- 
chase it at the price of acceding to the complete indepen- 
dence of the thirteen colonies." 

He said he would immediately despatch a courier 
London, and would press the ministry for permission to ac- 
knowledge <»ur independence without further delay, which 
he accordingly did. 

At this time the commission under the great seal had 
arrived, and Dr. Franklin and myself wont to Versailles to 
communicate that circumstance to the Count de Vergennes, 
and (agreeably to our instructions) to inform him of what 
had passed between Mr. Oswald and us. 

The count and myself again discussed the propriety of 
insisting, that our independence should he acknowledged 
previous to a treaty. He repeated, that it was exj 
the effect before the cause, and many other similar remarks, 
which did nut appear to me to be well founded. I told the 
count, that a declaration of our independence was, in my 
opinion, a matter of very little consequence ; that 1 did not 
consider our independence as requiring an) aid or validity 
from British acts ; and provided that nation treated us as 
she treated other nations, viz. on a footing of equality, it 
was all that I desired. He differed with me also in this 
opinion. He thought an explicit acknowledgment of our 
independence in treat} very necessary, in order to prevent 
our being exposed to further claims. 1 told him we should 
always have arms in our hands to answer those claims; that 
I considered mere paper fortifications as of hut httl< 
quence ; and that we should take cart an arl 

in the treaty, whereby the king of Great Britain should 
renounce all claims, of every kind, to the countries within 
our limits. 



464 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

The count informed us, he had delayed doing business 
with Mr. Fitzherbert, until we should be ready to proceed 
with Mr. Oswald, and that he expected to see him the next 
day or the day after. 

Mr. Fitzherbert went the next day to Versailles, and 
immediately despatched a courier to London. 

The answer of the British ministry to Mr. Oswald, is 
contained in the following extract of a letter to him from 
Mr. Townshend, dated Whitehall, September 1st, 1782. 

11 Sir, 

" I have received and laid before the king vour letters of 
the 17th, 18th, and 21st ultimo, and I am commanded to 
signify to you his majesty's approbation of your conduct, in 
communicating to the American commissioners the fourth 
article of your instructions ; which could not but convince 
them, that the negotiation for peace, and the cession of in- 
dependence to the Thirteen United Colonies, were intended 
to be carried on and concluded with the commissioners in 
Europe. 

" Those gentlemen, having expressed their satisfaction 
concerning that article, it is hoped they will not entertain a 
doubt of his majesty's determination to exercise, in the 
fullest extent, the powers with which the act of parliament 
has invested him, by granting to America, full, complete, and 
unconditional independence, in the most explicit manner, as 
an article of treaty." 

When Mr. Oswald communicated this letter to me, I did 
not hesitate to tell him, that his court was misled by this, for 
that the language of Mr. Townshend corresponded so ex- 
actly with that of the Count de Vergennes, and was at the 
same time so contrary to that of the instructions to Sir Guy 
Carleton, as to be inexplicable on any other principle. I 
also told him, I suspected that the courier despatched by 
Mr. Fitzherbert, on his return from Versailles, had been the 



OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE. It'..") 

means of infusing these ideas. He smiled : and after a little 
pause, said, « Why, ( lount de V< i d Mr. Fitzh< r- 

bert that my commission was come, and that he thought it 
would do, and therefore they might now :ord- 

ingly they did go on todiscu tain points, and particu- 

larly that of Newfoundland." 

Mr. Oswald did not deny or contradict the inference I 
drew from this, viz. that Mr. Fitzher . -Muck by this 
conduct of Count de Vergennes, and I that the com- 

mission given to Mr. Oswald was deemed sufficient by him, 
thought it his duty directly to inform his court of it, and 
thereby prevent their being embarrassed by our scruples 
and demands on a point, on which there \\ as so much reason 
to think that our allies were very moderate. 

For my own part, I was not only persuaded that this 
was the case, but also that the ill success of Mr. Oswald's 
application was owing to it. 

These considerations induced me to explain to him, what 
I supposed to be the natural policy of this court on the sub- 
ject, and to show him that it was the interest of Britain to 
render us as independent on France, as we were resolved 
to be on her. He soon adopted the same opinion, but \ 
at a loss to see in what manner Great Britain, considering 
what had just passed, could consistently take further steps at 
present. I told him that nothing was more easy, for that 
the issuing of another commission would do it. He asked 
me if he might write that to the mini-try: I told him he 
micht: he then desired, in order to avoid mistakes, that I 
would give it to him in writing, w hich I did as follows, viz. 

"A commission (in the usual form) to Richard Oswald, to 
treat of peace or truce with commissioners, voted with 
equal powers by and on the part of the United States of 
America, would remove the objections to which his present 
one is liable, and render it proper for the American com- 
missioners to proceed to treat with him on the subject of 
preliminaries." 

VOL. n. — N N N 



466 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

I then reminded him of the several resolutions of Con- 
gress, passed at different periods, not. to treat with British 
commissioners on any other footing than that of absolute 
independence, and also intimated that I thought it would be 
best to give him our final and decided determination not to 
treat otherwise in writing, in the form of a letter. He pre- 
ferred this to a verbal answer, and the next day I prepared 
the following draught of such a letter. 

" Sir, 

" It is with regret, that we find ourselves obliged, by our 
duty to our country, to object to entering with you into 
negotiations for peace on the plan proposed. One nation 
can treat with another nation only on terms of equality ; 
and it cannot be expected, that we should be the first and 
only servants of Congress, who would admit doubts of their 
independence. 

" The tenor of your commission affords matter for a va- 
riety of objections, which your good sense will save us the 
pain of enumerating. The journals of ( Jongress present to 
you unequivocal and uniform evidence of the sentiments and 
resolutions of Congress on the subject, and their positive 
instructions to us to speak the same language. 

" The manner of removing these obstacles is obvious, and, 
in our opinion, no less consistent with the dignity than the 
interest of Great Britain. If the parliament meant to enable 
the king to conclude a peace with us on terms of indepen- 
dence, they necessarily meant to enable him to do it in a 
manner compatible with his dignity ; and consequently, 
that he should previously regard us in a - point of view, that 
would render it proper for him to negotiate with us. What 
this point of view is, you need not be informed. 

" We also take the liberty of submitting to your consid- 
eration, how far his majesty's now declining to take this 
step would comport with the assurances lately given on that 
subject, and whether hesitation and delav would not tend to 



OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE. lf.7 

lessen the confidence which those assurances were calcu- 
lated to inspire. 

" As to referring an acknowledgment of our independence 
to the first article of a treaty, permit us to remark, that this 
implies, that we are not to be considered in that light until 
after the conclusion of the treat}', and our acquiesc 
would be to admit the propriety of our being considered in 
another light during that interval. Had this circumstance 
been attended to, we presume that the court of Great Brit- 
ain would not have pressed a measure, which certainly is not 
delicate, and which cannot be reconciled with the received 
ideas of national honour. 

" You may rest assured, sir, of our disposition to peace 
on reasonable terms, and of our readiness to enter seriously 
into negotiations for it, as soon as we shall have an oppor- 
tunity of doing it in the only manner in which it is possible 
for one nation to treat with another, viz. on an equal footing. 

" Had you been commissioned in the usual manner, we 
might have proceeded; and as we can perceive no legal or 
other objection to this, or some other such like expedient, it 
is to be wished that his majesty will not permit an obstacle 
so very unimportant to Great Britain, but so essential and 
insuperable with respect to us, to delay there-establishment 
of peace especially ; and in case the business could be but 
once begun, the confidence we have in your candour and 
integrity would probably render the settling all our articles 
onlv the work of a few hours. 

" We are, &c." 

I submitted this draught to Dr. Franklin's consideration. 
He thought it rather too positive, ami therefore rather im- 
prudent, for that in case Britain should remain firm, and 
future circumstances should compel us to submit to their 
mode of treating, we should do it with an ill grace after 
such a decided and peremptory refusal. Besides, the doctor 
seemed to be much perplexed and fettered by our instruc- 



468 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

tions to be guided by the advice of this court. Neither of 
these considerations had weight with me ; for as to the first, 
I could not conceive of any event which would render it 
proper, and therefore possible, for America to treat in any 
other character than as an independent nation ; and, as to 
the second, I could not believe that Congress intended we 
should follow any advice which might be repugnant to 
their dignity and interest. 

On returning to town, Mr. Oswald spoke to me about this 
letter. I told him that I had prepared a draught of one, 
but that on further consideration, and consulting with Dr. 
Franklin, we thought it best not to take the liberty of troub- 
ling his court with any arguments or reasonings, which, 
without our aid, must be very evident to them. 

He appeared disappointed, and desired me to let him see 
the draught. I did. He liked it. He requested a copy 
of it : but as I doubted the propriety of such a step, I told 
him I would consider of it, and give him an answer the next 
day. 

It appeared to me, on further reflection, that no bad con- 
sequences would arise from giving him a copy of this paper ; 
that, though unsigned, it would nevertheless convey to the 
ministry the sentiments and opinions I wished to impress, 
and that if finally they should not be content to treat with 
us as independent, they were not yet ripe for peace or treaty 
with us ; besides, I could not be persuaded that Great Brit- 
ain, after what the House of Commons had declared, after 
what Mr. Grenville had said, and Sir Guy Carleton been 
instructed to do, w r ould persist in refusing to admit our 
independence, provided they really believed that we had 
firmly resolved not to treat on more humble terms. 

I gave him a copy, and also copies of the various resolu- 
tions of Congress, which evince their adherence to their in- 
dependence. These papers he sent by express to London, 
and warmly recommended the issuing a new commission to 
remove all further delay. This matter was not communi- 



OFFICIAL CORRESPOND EN< I '.. 169 

cated to the Count do Vcrgcnncs, at least to my knowh 
or belief", by either of us. 

I might now enumerate the various expedients proposed 
by the Count de Vergennes and the Marquis de Lafayette 

to reconcile our difficulties. Such as Mr. < Oswald's writing 
a letter to us, signifying that he treated with us as inde] 
dent, &c. &c. But as our independence was indivisi 

there could not easily be contrived a half-way mode of ac- 
knowledging it, and therefore any method of doinL. r it short 
of the true and proper one, could not bear examination. 

Being convinced that the objections to our following the 
advice of the Count de Vergennes were unanswerable, I 
proposed to Dr. Franklin, that we should state them in a 
letter to him, and request his answer in writing, because, 
we were instructed to ask and to follow his advice on these 
occasions, we ought always to be able to show what his 
advice was. 

The doctor approved of the measure, and I undertook to 
prepare a draught of such a letter. 

I must now remind you of what some of my former let- 
ters informed you, viz. the propositions made to me by the 
Count d'Aranda on the part of Spain. It is necessary that 
I should in this place go into that detail, because they will 
be found in the sequel to be strongly connected with the 
subject more immediately under consideration. 

On my arrival at Paris, in June last, it being doubtful 
whether if I made a visit to Count d'Aranda he would re- 
turn it, I thought it most advisable to avoid that risk, and to 
write him the following letter. 

TO COUNT d'aRANDA. 

" Paris, June 25th, i 
" Sir, 
" On leaving Madrid, his excellency the Count d I : ida 
Blanca informed me, that the" papers relative to the objects 
of my mission there had been transmitted to your excel- 



470 LIFE OP JOHN JAY. 

lency, with authority and instructions to treat with me on 
the subject of them. 

" I arrived here the day before yesterday, and have the 
honour to acquaint your excellency of my being ready to 
commence the necessary conferences, at such time and place 
as your excellency may think proper to name. 

" Your excellency's character gives me reason to hope, 
that the negotiation in question will be conducted in a 
manner agreeable to both our countries ; and permit me to 
assure you, that nothing on my part shall be wanting to 
manifest the respect and consideration, with which I have 
the honour to be, &c. 

"John Jay." 

The following is a copy of the count's answer. 

TRANSLATION. 

" Paris, June 27th, 1782. 

"Sir, 

" I have the honour to reply to your note of the 25th, 
informing me of your happy arrival at this court. I shall 
also have the honour to receive you, when you shall inti- 
mate that it is proper, and whenever you will inform me of 
your intention, so that I may expect you at whatever hour 
shall be most convenient to you. 

" I shall be pleased to make your acquaintance, and to 
assure you of the respect with which I have the honour, &c. 

" The Count d'Aranda." 

It having been intimated to Dr. Franklin, that if we paid 
a visit to Count d'Aranda, it would be returned, we waited 
on him on the 29th of June. He received us in a friendly 
manner, and expressed his wishes that closer connexion 
might be formed between our countries, on terms agreeable 
to both. 

He returned our visit the next day, and gave us an invi-

tation to dine with him a few days afterward. ( >n that day 

I was taken sick, and continued so for n 

indeed, am I yet perfectly rec o . 

illness, having a constant pain in my b . ntly 

a little fever. 

Hence it happened, that I did not m int d'Arai 

on business till a month a: to ;i 

previous appointment. I waited upon him. 

He began the conference by vari narks on the 

general principles on which contracting nations should form 
treaties, on the magnanimity of his sovereign, and on his 
own disposition to disregard trifling considerations in great 
matters. Then opening Michell's large map of North 
America, he asked me what were our boundaries ; 1 told 
him that the boundary between us and the Spanish domin- 
ions was a line drawn from the head of Mississippi, down 
the middle thereof, to the thirty-first dei north latitude, 

and from thence by the line between Florida and < i- ■■ .r_ r i.'i. 

He entered into along discussion of our right a an 

extent, and insisted principally on two < to it. 1st. 

That the western country had never belonged to, or heen 
claimed as belonging to, the ancient 3. That, pre- 

vious to the last war, it had belonged to Fr ter its 

cession to Britain remained a distinct pari ofherdomin 
until, by the conquest of West Florida and certain posts 
the Mississippi and Illinois, it became vested in Spain. 
2dly. That supposing the Spanish 1 t did not 

extend over all that country, still that it was possessed by 
free and independent nations of Indians, whose lands we 
could not, with any propriety, considi 
He therefore proposed to run a longitudinal line on the 
east side of the river for our western boundary; ai 
that he did not mean to dispute about a few acres or m 
but wished to run it in a manner that would be convenient 
to us; for though he could never admit the extent 



472 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

claimed, yet he did not desire to crowd us up to our exact 
limits. 

As it did not appear to me expedient to enter fully into 
the discussion of these objections until after he had marked 
the line he proposed, I told him I would forbear troubling 
him with any remarks on the subject until the points in 
controversy should be reduced to a certainty ; and, there- 
fore, I desired him to mark on the map the line he pro- 
posed, and to place it as far to the west as his instructions 
would possibly admit of. He promised to do it, and to 
send me the map with his proposed line marked on it in a 
day or two. 

I then gave him a copy of my commission, and showed 
him the original. He returned it to me with expressions 
of satisfaction, and then changed the subject, by desiring 
me, if, after receiving his map and examining his lines, I 
should find it in any respect inconvenient, that I would 
mark such other line on it as would, in my opinion, be more 
agreeable to America ; assuring me, that he had nothing 
more at heart than to fix such a boundary between us as 
might be satisfactory to both parties. I told him, that on 
receiving his map, I would take all that he had said into con- 
sideration, and take the earliest opportunity of acquainting 
him with my sentiments respecting it. I then observed, that 
I hoped his powers to treat were equal with mine. He re- 
plied, that he had ample powers to confer, but not to sign 
any thing, without previously communicating it to his court, 
and receiving their orders for the purpose ; but, to my sur- 
prise, he did not offer to show me any powers of any kind. 

A few days afterward he sent me the same map, with 
his proposed line marked on it in red ink. He ran it from 
a lake near the confines of Georgia, but east of the Flint 
River, to the confluence of the Kanawa with the Ohio, 
thence round the western shores of Lakes Erie and Huron, 
and thence round Lake Michigan to Lake Superior. 



OFFICIAL i OttRESPONDEN) E. 173 

< Mi the 10th of August, learned this map to theCounl 
\ ergennes ami left it with him. Dr. Franklin joined with 

in pointing out the extravagance of this line ; ami I must 
do hitn the justice to say, that in all his letters t>> me, and in 
all his conversations with me respecting our western extent, 
lie has invariably declared it to be his opinion, that 
should insist on the Mississippi as our western boundary, 
and that we ought not, by any means, to part with our right 
t<> the free navigation of it. 

The Count de Vergennes was very cautious and re- 
served ; but j\I. Rayneval, his principal secretary, who 
was present, thought wc claimed more than we had a 
right to. 

Having thus clearly discovered the views of Spain, rind 
that they were utterly inadmissible, 1 had little hope of our 
ever agreeing ; especially as the Mississippi was, and ought 
to be, our ultimatum. 

It was not loner before I had another interview with M. 
Rayneval. He asked me whether 1 had made any pr 
in my negotiations with the Count d'Aranda. [told him, 
that the count had not yet shown me any powers from \\\< 
court to treat. He expressed surprise that I should hi 
any difficulties on that head; especially considering the 
public as well as private character of that nobleman. 1 
replied, that I was very sensible of the respectability . i 
of his public and private character ; but, that neither the 
one nor the other authorized him to negotiate treaties with 
the United States of America ; and consequently, that his 
court would be at liberty to disavow all his j ings in 

such business. That it was my duty to adhere to the 
forms usual in such cases, and that those forms rendered it 
proper for ministers to exchange copies of their commis- 
sions, before they proceeded on the business which was the 
object of them. 

The Count d'Aranda was very urgent that I should mark 

VOL. II. — o o o 



474 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

on his map some line or other to the eastward of the Mis- 
sissippi, to which we could agree ; and on the 26th of Au- 
gust we had another conference on these subjects. I told 
him frankly, that we were bound by the Mississippi, and 
that I had no authority to cede any territories cast of it to 
his Catholic Majesty, and that all I could do relative to it, 
was to transmit his proposition to Congress for their con- 
sideration. 

He affected to be much surprised that I should have no 
discretionary authority on that subject, and observed, that 
he had supposed I was a minister plenipotentiary. I told 
him, that few ministers plenipotentiary had discretionary 
power to transfer and cede to others the countries of their 
sovereigns. He denied that the countries in question were 
our countries, and asked what right we had to territories, 
which manifestly belonged to free and independent nations 
of Indians. I answered, that those were points to be dis- 
cussed and settled between us and them ; that we claimed 
the right of pre-emption with respect to them, and the sove- 
reignty with respect to all other nations. I reminded him, 
that Mexico and Peru had been in the same predicament, 
and yet that his Catholic Majesty had had no doubts of his 
right to the sovereignty of those countries. 

He then desired me to write him a letter on the subject, 
in order that he might, with the greater accuracy, convey 
my sentiments to his court. 

On the 4th of September, I received the following letter 
from M. de Rayneval.

my memoir appears to me the most proper to effect a rea- 
sonable conciliation ; but it is for you to judge whether I 
am mistaken, because you alone have a knowledge of the 
title, which the United States can have to extend their pos- 
sessions at the expense of nations, whom England herself 
has acknowledged to be independent.

M. de RaynevaVs Memoir respecting the right of the United 
States to the navigation of the Mississippi. 

TRANSLATION. 

" The question between Spain and the United States of 
North America is, how to regulate their respective limits 
towards the Ohio and the Mississippi. The Americans pre- 
tend that their dominion extends as far as the Mississippi, 
and Spain maintains the contrary. 

" It is evident that the Americans can only borrow from 
England the right they pretend to have to extend as far as 
the Mississippi; therefore, to determine this right, it is 
proper to examine what the court of London lias thought 
and done on this head. 



0FFH 1 VI i 0RRE8P0NDENI E. 171 

[I is known, that b< fore the treaty of Paris, Franc< 
;ed Louisiania and Canada, and thai she consider d the 
savage people, situated to the east of the M Lher 

ns independent, or as under her protection. 

"This pretension caused no dispute; England m 
thought of making any, except, as to the lands situated 
towards the source of the Ohio, in thai part where she had 
given the u;unc of Alleghany to that river. 

"A discussion about limits at that time took place between 
the courts of Versailles and London, bu1 it would be super- 
fluous to follow the particulars; it will sutlice to o 
that England proposed in 1755 the following boundary. It 
set out from the point where the River dc Bocuf falls into 
the Ohio, at the place called Venango ; it went up this river 
towards Lake Eric as far as twenty leagues, and setting i ifl 
again from the same place, Venango, a right line was drawn 
ns far as the last mountains of Virginia, which descend to- 
wards the ocean. As to the savage tribes situated between 
the aforesaid line and the Mississippi, the English mini 
considers them as independent; from whence it follows, tint 
according to the very propositions of the court of Loudon. 
almost the whole course of the Ohio belonged to Frat 
and that the countries situated to the westward of the m< »un- 
tains were considered as having nothing in common with 
the colonies. 

•• When peace was negotiated in 1761, France offered to 
make a cession of Canada to England. The regulation of 
the limits of this colony and Louisiana was in question. 
France pretended that almost the whole rnwv^' of the < >hio 
made a part of Louisiana, and the court of London, topr< 
that this river belonged to Canada, produced several au- 
thentic papers ; among others, the chart which M. \ audreuil 
delivered to the English commandant when he abandoned 
Canada. The minister of London maintained, al the same 
time, that a pari of the savages situated to the eastward ol 
the Mississippi were independent, another part under it- 



178 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

protection, and that England had purchased a part from the 
live Iroquois nations. The misfortunes of France cut these 
discussions short ; the treaty of Paris assigned the Missis- 
sippi for the boundary between the possessions of France 
and Great Britain. 

" Let us sec the dispositions which the court of London 
has made in consequence of the treaty of Paris. 

" If they had considered the vast territories situated to 
the eastward of the Mississippi as forming part of their 
ancient colonies, they would have declared so, and have 
made their dispositions accordingly. So far from any such 
thing, the king of England, in a proclamation of the month 
of October, 1 7G3, declares in a precise and positive manner 
that the lands in question are situated between the Missis- 
sippi and the ancient English establishments. It is, there- 
fore, clearly evident, that the court of London itself, when 
it was as yet sovereign of the thirteen colonies, did not 
consider the aforementioned lands as forming part of these 
same colonies ; and it results from this in the most demon- 
strative manner, that they have not at this time any right 
over these lands. To maintain the contrary, every prin- 
ciple of the laws of nature and nations must be subverted. 

" The principles now established are as applicable to 
Spain as to the United States. This power cannot extend 
its claims beyond the bounds of its conquests. She cannot, 
therefore, pass beyond the Natchez, situated towards the 
thirty-first degree of latitude ; her rights are, therefore, con- 
fined to this degree ; what is beyond, is either independent, 
or belonging to England ; neither Spain nor the Americans 
can have any pretensions thereto. The future treaty of 
peace can alone regulate the respective rights. 

" The consequence of all that has been said is, that 
neither Spain nor the United States has the least right of 
sovereignty over the savages in question, and that the trans- 
actions they may carry on as to this country would be to 
no purpose. 



OF] ICIAL ( ORR] SrONJ 

"But the future may bring forth new cireun ud 

this reflection leads one to suppose, thai it would 1"- of 
that the court of .Madrid and the United States should make 
an eventual arrangement. 

"This arrangement may be made in tl lan- 

ner. A right line should be drawn from I 
oi the Gulf of Mexico, which makes thi n between the 

two Floridas, to Fort Toulouse, situated in tlie countr 
theAlabamas; from thence the river Loneshatchi should 
be ascended, from the mouth of which a righl line should be 
drawn to the Fori or Factory Queni ; from this 

place, the course of the river Euphasee is to be follow 
till it joins the Cherokee; the course of this last river ; 
be pursued to the place where it n I' lisippi ; this 

last to be followed to its source, from whence a right 
is to be drawn to Cumberland River, whose course i- i 
followed until it falls into the Ohio. The sava • the 

westward of tlie line described should In: free, under 
protection of Spain; those to the eastward should, be fj 
and under the pr< a of 1 he United Stal rather, 

the Americans may make such arrangements with then 
is most convenient to themselves. The trade should be 
free to both parties. 

"By looking over the chart, we shall find that Spain 
would lose almost the whole course of the Ohio, and that 
the establishments which the Americans may have on this 
river, would remain untouched, and that even a very exten- 
sive space remains to form new ones. 

"As to the course and navigation of th ssippi, they 

follow with the property, and they will belong, tl 
the nation to which the two banks bcl< ng. If then, b) 
future treaty of peace, Spain p. lorida, 

alone will be the proprietor of the course of tl ' ippi 

from the thirty-first degree of latitude to tin: mouth of this 
river. Whatever may he the case with that part which i 
beyond this point to the north, the United States of Amcj 



480 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

can have no pretensions to it, not being masters of either 
border of this river. 

" As to what respects the lands situated to the northward 
oi the Ohio, there is reason to presume that Spain can form 
no pretensions thereto. Their fate must be regulated with 
the court of London." 

I did not return M. Rayneval any answer to his letter, 

nor any remarks on his memoir, but the first time I saw him 
afterward, I told him I had received his letter and memoir 
he had done me the honour to write, and that I should send 
a copy of it to our secretary for foreign affairs. 

As both the letter and memoir were ostensibly written by 
him in a private character, it did not appear to me expedient 
or necessary to enter into any formal discussions with him 
on those subjects. 

The perusal of this memoir convinced me, 

1st. That this court would, at a peace, oppose our exten- 
sion to the Mississippi. 

2dly. That they would oppose our claim to the free 
navigation of that river. 

3dly. That they would probably support the British 
claims to all the country above the 31st degree of latitude, 
and certainly to all the country north of the Ohio. 

4thly. That in case we should not agree to divide with 
Spain in the manner proposed, that then this court would 
aid Spain in negotiating with Britain for the territory she 
wanted, and would agree that the residue should remain to 
Britain. 

In my opinion, it was not to be believed that the first and 
confidential secretary of the Count de Vergennes would, 
without his knowledge and consent, declare such sentiments, 
and offer such propositions, and that, too, in writing. I 
therefore considered M. Rayneval as speaking the senti- 
ments of the minister, and I confess they alarmed me, espe- 
cially as they seemed naturally to make a part of that 



OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE. 1M 

system of policy which I believed induced him rather to 
postpone the acknowledgment of our independence by 
Britain to the conclusion of a general peace, than aid ns in 
procuring it at present. 

You will now be pleased to recollect the posl I I M. 
Rayneval's letter. 

On the 9th of September, 1 received certain inform) 
that on the 7th M. Rayneval had lefl Versai -. a 
gone to England ; that it was pretended he was gone into 
the country, and that several precautions had been t 
keep his real destination a secret. 

A former page in this letter informs you that a little be- 
fore this, Mr. Oswald had despatched a courier with letl 
recommending it to his court to issue a nevt commission, 
styling us United States, and that 1 had agreed to pre] 
a letter to the Count de Vergennes, stating our 
to treat with Mr. ( >swald under his present one. 

This, therefore, was a period of uncertainty and 
and whatever part Britain might take, must nec< - 
followed by very important consequences. No til 
therefore, to be lost in counteracting what I supposed t< 
the object of M. Rayneval's journey. I5ut before 1 enter 
into that detail, I must here insert a copy of the letter which 
I wrote to the Count d'Aranda, agreeably to his request 
herein beforementioned.

" Sir,

receiving that information, may think proper to give me on 
that subject. 

" Permit me, nevertheless, to remind your excellency that 
I have lull power to confer, treat, agree, and conclude with 
the ambassador or plenipotentiary of his Catholic Majesty^

equality, reciprocity, and mutual advantage. 

" I can only regret that my overtures to his excellency

to confer with me on such subjects, have been fruitless.

OFFICIAL i i '.MM SPONDENl R. 

On the same day, viz. the 10th of Septeml 
a translation of a letter from M. Ma] I 

\ « i"lt< ntK's, againsl our sharing in the fishery, 
my hands. ( !opies of il were transmitted to you, enclo 
with my letter of the 18th of Scptembi r, of which a dupli- 
cate was also forwarded. 

I also learned, from good authority, that on the morni 
of Si. Rayneval's departure, the Coun nda had, con- 

trary to his usual practice, ^one with post-h ■ ■ 

sailles, and was two or three hours in nee with the 

Count dc Vergennes and M. Ilayneval, before the lal 
set out. 

All these facts taken together, led me to , that 

M. Rayneval was sent to England for tin- following pur- 
poses. 

1st. To let. Lord Shelburne know that the ads of 

Ameriea, to he treated by Britain as independent previi 
to a treat} - , wore not approved or countenanced by this 
court, and that the offer of Britain to make that acknow- 
ledgment in an article of the proposed treaty was, in the 
count's opinion, sufficient. 

2dly. To sound Lord Shelburne on tl of the 

fisherv. and to discover whether Britain would agree to 

ti 

divide it with France, to the exclusion of all oth< 

3dly. To impress I iOrd Shelburne with the determinal 

of Spain to possess tin' exclusive navigation of the Gulf of 

Mexico, and of their desire to keep us from tl: issippi ; 

and also to hint the propriety of such a i. 

hand, would satisfy Spain, and on the other, leav< I tin 

all the country north of the ( Ihio. 

4thly. To make such other verbal overtures to Lord 

Shelburne as it might not he advisable to reduce v< v 

and to judge from the general tenor o lordshi 

swers and conversation, whether il v

effected, in order that if that was not the case, an imme- 
diate stop might be put to the negotiation, 

Having, after much consideration, become persuaded, that 
these were M. Rayneval's objects, I mentioned his journey 
to Mr. Oswald, and after stating to him the first thz*ee of 
these objects, I said every thing respecting them that ap- 
peared to me necessary ; but at the same time with a greater 
degree of caution than I could have wished, because I well 
knew it would become the subject of a long letter to the 
ministry. On reflecting, however, how necessary it was 
that Lord. Shelburne should know our sentiments and reso- 
lutions respecting these matters, and how much better they 
could be conveyed, in conversation than by letter ; and 
knowing also, that Mr. Vaughan was in confidential cor- 
respondence with him, and he was and always had been 
strongly attached to the American cause, I concluded it 
would be prudent to prevail upon him to go immediately 
to England. 

I accordingly had an interview with Mr, Vaughan, and 
he immediately despatched a few lines to Lord Shelburne, 
desiring that he would delay taking any measures with M. 
Rayneval, until he should either see or hear further from 
him. 

Mr. Vaughan agreed to go to England, and we had much 
previous conversation on the points in question ; the sub- 
stance of which was, 

That Britain, by a peace with us, certainly expected 
other advantages than a mere suspension of hostilities, and 
that she doubtless looked forward to cordiality, confidence, 
and commerce. 

That the manner as well as the matter of the proposed 
treaty was therefore of importance, and that if the late assur- 
ances respecting our independence were not realized by an 
unconditional acknowledgment, neither confidence nor peace 
could reasonably be expected ; that this measure was con- 



OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE. l->."> 

sidered by America as the touchstone of British sincerity, 
and that nothing could abate the suspicions and doi I 

her good faith, which prevailed there. 

That the interest of Greal Britain, as well as that of the 
minister, would be advanced by it ; for i ry ide: 

conquest had become absurd, nothing remained I 
to do, but to make friends of those whom she could not sub- 
due; that the way to do this was by leaving us nothin 
complain of, either in the negotiation or in the treaty of 
peace, and by liberally yielding* very poinl i I to the 

interest and happiness of America ; the first of which points 
was, that of treating with us on an equal footing. 

That if the minister really meant to make peace with 
it was his interest to make us believe so, and thereby inspire 
us with a certain degree of confidence, which could no 
otherwise be obtained ; that his enemies charged him with 
insincerity on this very point, and that it must be useful 
to him to convince all the world that such a charge ■• 
groundless. 

That it would be vain to amuse themselves with ex] 
tations from the affected moderation of France on this head ; 
for that America never would treat on any but an equal 
footing, and, therefore, although such expectations might 
cause delay, they would ultimately be fruitless. 

That a little reflection must convince him that it was the 
interest and. consequently, the policy of France to postpone 
if possible the acknowledgment of our independence to the 
very conclusion of a general peace, and by keeping it 
pended until after the war, oblige us, by the terms /' 
treaty, and by regard to our safety, to continue in it to 
end. 

That it hence appeared to be the obvious inr 
Britain immediately to cut the cords which tied u 
France, for that, though we were determined faithfull; 
fulfil our treaty and engagements with this court, yet it teas 



486 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

a different thing to be guided by their or our construction 
of it. 

That, among other things, we were bound not to make 
a separate peace or truce, and that the assurance of our 
independence was avowed to be the object of our treaty. 
While, therefore, Great Britain refused to yield this object, 
we were bound, as well as resolved, to go on with the war, 
although, perhaps, the greatest obstacles to a peace arose 
neither from the demands of France nor America. Whereas, 
that object being conceded, we should be at liberty to make 
peace the moment that Great Britain should be ready to 
accede to the terms of France and America, without our 
being restrained by the demands of Spain, with whose views 
we had no concerns. 

That it would not be wise in Great Britain to think of 
dividing the fishery with France and excluding us ; because 
we could not make peace at such an expense, and because 
such an attempt would irritate America still more : would 
perpetuate her resentments, and induce her to use every 
possible means of retaliation by withholding supplies in fu- 
ture to the fishery, and by imposing the most rigid restraints 
on a commerce with Britain. 

That it would not be less impolitic to oppose us on the 
point of boundary and the navigation of the Mississippi: 

1st. Because our right to extend to the Mississippi was 
proved by our charters and other acts of government ; and 
our right to its navigation was deducible from the laws of 
nature, and the consequences of revolution, which vested 
in us every British territorial right. It was easy, therefore, 
to foresee what opinions and sensations the mere attempt 
to dispossess us of these rights would diffuse throughout 
America. 

2dly. Because the profits of an extensive and lucrative 
commerce, and not the possession of vast tracts of wilder- 
ness, were the true objects of a commercial European 
nation. 



OFFI< IAL I ORRESPOND1 m 1 . 

That by our extending to the Missis 
and to the proclamation bounds of Canada to the north, and 
by consenting to the mutual free navigation of our several 

lakes and rivers, there would be an inland na n from 

the Gulf of St. I ,a\\ r o that of Ah - 

which the inhabitants ad north of the mountains 

might, with more ease, I"- supplied with foreign 

ities than from ports on t: ■ \\ mtic, and that this in 

and growing trade would be in a manner monopolized by 

Great Brita . we should not insist that she should admit 

other nations to navigate the waters 

That therefore the navigation of th< M ssippi would, in 

future, be no less important to her than to us, it being the 

only convenient outlet, through which they could trans] 

the productions of the w< stern country, which they would 

receive in payment for merchandise vended ther . 

That as to retaining any part of that country,or insisting 
to extend Canada so as to comprehend the lands in question, 
it would be impolitic, for these further ] . I'. 

would not be in their power either to settle i . rn that 

country; that we should refuse to yield them any aid, and 
that the utmost exertions of G ss could not prevent 

our people from taking gradual possession "f it, by making 
establishments in different parts of it. That it certainly 
could not be wise in Britain, whatever it might be in other

treaty of pi >r to lay in it the foundation "I" sued dis- 

trusts and jealousies as, on the one hand, would fo 
prevent confidence and real friendship, and 
naturally lead us to strengthen our security by intin 
and permanent alliances with other nations. 

1 desired Mr. Vaughan to commui th< se n 'narks 

to Lord Shelburne, and to impress him with the n< 
and policy of taking a decided and manly part 
America. 

Mr. Vaughan set off the evening of th<' 1 1 th 



488 LIFE OF JOHN JAY. 

It would have relieved me from much anxiety and uneasi- 
ness to have concerted all these steps with Dr. Franklin, 
but on conversing with him about M. Rayneval's journey, 
he did not concur with me in sentiment respecting the ob- 
jects of it : but appeared to me to have a great degree of 
confidence in this court, and to be much embarrassed and 
constrained by our instructions. 

I think it was on the 24th of September, that I was 
informed of the intention of the British court to give Mr. 
Oswald such a new commission as had been recommended. 

On the 26th of September, I went to pay a visit to the 
Count de Vergennes, at Versailles. I found the Marquis 
de Lafayette in the antechamber, and the ambassador of 
Spain shortly after entered. After some common conver- 
sation, the ambassador asked me when we should proceed 
to do business. I told him as soon as he should do me the 
honour of communicating his powers to treat. He asked 
me whether the Count de Florida Blanca had not informed 
me of his being authorized. I admitted that he had, but 
observed, that the usual mode of doing business rendered 
it proper that we should exchange certified copies of our 
respective commissions. He said that could not be ex- 
pected in our case ; for that Spain had not yet acknow- 
ledged our independence. I replied, that we had declared 
it, and that France, Holland, and Britain had acknowledged 
it. Here the Marquis de Lafayette took up the subject, 
and it continued between him and the ambassador, till the 
Count de Vergennes came in. The marquis told the am- 
bassador, among other things, that it would not be consistent 
with the dignity of France, for her ally to treat otherwise 
than as independent. This remark appeared to me to pique 
the Count d'Aranda not a little. 

The Count de Vergennes, on coming in, finding the con- 
versation earnest, inquired whether we could not agree. 
The ambassador stated my objections. The count said I 



OFFU IAL < ORR] iPONDl N< 

certainly ought to treat with th . and that it 

proper we should make a treaty with Spam in th< 
manner that we had done with France. I told him I 
nothing more ; and that the commission I d, and 

the reason assigned by this court 1 K 

for entering into alliance with us, pointed i 
ner and the principles which d and admitted on 

that occasion. The count did not seem i with my allu- 

sion to the communication n our allianc ■ I ■ England. 

He observed that Spain did not deny our iml 
and he could perceive no good i for my declining to 

confer with the ambassador about a treaty, with 
any thing about our ind nee, an acknowledgment of 

which would naturally be the effect of th< 
to be formed. 1 told the count, that being indent, we 

should always insist on being treated as such, and, there- 
fore, it was not sufficient for Spa; 
independence while she declined to admit it; and that 
withstanding my respect for the amba , and m;. 

of a treaty with Spain, both th f my commis 

and the dignity of America forbid my treatin ther 

than an equal footing. 

The count carried the ambassador into his cabinet, and 
when he retired, I was admitted. 

The count commenced the conversation, by explaining 
the reason of sending M. Rayneval to England, which he 
said was, that by conversing with Lord Shelburne al 
peace and matter- c ed with it. he m 

judge whether a pacific disposition really pr the 

British court, and, therefore, whether any depend. 
might be placed in his lordship's professions on that 
that he was satisfied with M. Ra) ' report, and that 

he believed that Lord Shelburne was sincerely d 
peace. 

A few words then 
mission: the count observing, ral terms, that i

removed our former objections, we might now go on to 
prepare our preliminaries. 

The conversation next turned to our negotiation with 
Spain, and to her claims east of the Mississippi. Nothing 
new passed on the first topic ; as to the latter, the count 
made only some very general remarks, such as that he 
hoped we should, on conferring further about the matter, 
approach nearer to each other ; that those limits ought to 
be settled, and while they remained in contest, a treaty 
with Spain could not reasonably be expected; that as soon 
as we should agree upon those points, Count d'Aranda would 
have a further or more formal commission to conclude the 
treaty, &c. 

I remarked, that these claims of Spain were of recent 
date, for that on my first arriving in Spain, the Count de 
Florida Blanca told me, that the success of my mission 
would probably turn upon one single point, viz. the cession 
of our rights to the navigation of the river Mississippi ; 
from which, as well as from their subsequent and uniform 
demands on that head, it was evident, that they then con- 
sidered that river as our boundary ; for it would have been 
very strange indeed, that they should insist on our forbear- 
ing to navigate a river, whose waters washed no part of 
our country, and to which we could not, of consequence, 
have any pretence of claim. 

The count smiled, but avoided making any direct re- 
ply ; he hoped we should, nevertheless, agree, and that we 
must endeavour to approach and meet each other. I told 
him I could not natter myself with such expectations, 
while Spain continued her claims to those countries, for 
that we should be content with no boundary short of the 
Mississippi. 

I went from the count's to M. RaynevaPs chamber, for I 
had not seen him since his return from England. He gave 
me the same reason for his journey which I had just re- 
ceived from the count. We then talked of his memoir and

letters from the minister informed him that the extent of 
our boundaries, and the situation of the tories, &c. caused 
some objections, and the minister's secretary was on the 
way here to confer with us on those subjects. 

On the 24th of October, I dined at Passy, with Dr. 
Franklin, where I found M. Rayneval. After dinner, we 
were in private with him a considerable time. He de- 
sired to know the state of our negotiation with Mr. Oswald, 
We told- him that difficulties had arisen about our bounda- 
ries, and that one of the minister's secretaries was coming 
here with papers and documents on that subject. He asked 
us what boundaries we claimed. We told him, the river 
St. John to the east, and ancient Canada, as described in 
the proclamation, to the north. He contested our right to 
such an extent to the north, and entered into several argu- 
ments to show our claim to be ill-founded. These arguments 
were chiefly drawn from the ancient French claims, and 
from a clause in the proclamation restraining governors 
from making grants in the Indian country, &c. 

He inquired what we demanded as to the fisheries. We 
answered, that we insisted on enjoying a right in common 
to them with Great Britain. He intimated that our views 
should not extend further than a coast fishery, and insinu- 
ated that pains had lately been taken in the eastern States 
to excite their apprehensions and increase their demands 
on that head. We told him that such a right was essential 
to us, and that our people would not be content to make 
peace without it ; and Dr. Franklin explained very fully, 
their great importance to the eastern States in particular. 
He then softened his manner, and observed that it was 
natural for France to wish better to us than to England ; 
but as the fisheries were a great nursery for seamen, we 
might suppose that England would be disinclined to admit 
others to share in it, and that for his part he wished there 
might be as few obstacles to a peace as possible. He

On the 26th of October, Mr. A.dan * rrived I id in

When I began this letter, I did not flatter myself with 
being able to write this much before < aptain Barncj 
leave us; and 1 now find myself too much exhau I 
proceed with further details, and must th you 

to the letters you will receive from Mr. Adams and I 1 . 
Franklin. 

The same reason also prevents my writing to you and 
Mr. Morris on other subjects, by Captain Barney, and I 
hope the length of this letter, and the disagree state of 

my health, will apologize for my not writii 
own family by this opportunity. 

I am sensible of the impression which this * will 

make upon you and upon Congress, and how it will affect 
the confidence they have in this court. Thesi 
ical times, and great necessity there is for prui and 

secrecy. 

So far, and in such matters as this court may think it 
their interest to support us, they certainly will, but no fur- 
ther, in my opinion. 

They are interested in separating us from Great Britain, 
and on that point we may, I believe, depend upon them: 
but it is not their interest that we should become a g 
and formidable people, and therefore they will not hcl] 
to become so. 

It is not their interest that such a treaty sho 
formed between us and Britain, as would produce 
diality and mutual confidence. They will, thei 
deavour to plant such seeds of jealousy, d I nt, and 

discord in it as may naturally and perpetually k< 
eyes fixed on France for security, 
must induce them to wish to render Bril i formidabl

our neighbourhood, and to leave us as few resources of 
wealth and power as possible. 

It is their interest to keep some point or other in con- 
test between us and Britain to the end of the war, to pre- 
vent the possibility of our sooner agreeing, and thereby 
keep us employed in the war, and dependent on them for 
supplies. Hence they have favoured, and will continue 
to favour, the British demands as to matters of boundary 
and the tories. 

The same views will render them desirous to continue 
the war in our country as long as possible, nor do I be- 
lieve they will take any measures for our repossession of 
New-York, unless the certainty of its evacuation should 
render such an attempt advisable. The Count de Ver- 
gennes lately said, that there could be no great use in 
expeditions to take places, which must be given up to us 
at a peace. 

Such being our situation, it appears to me advisable to 
keep up our army to the end of the war, even if the enemy 
should evacuate our country ; nor does it appear to me 
prudent to listen to any overtures for carrying a part of it 
to the West Indies, in case of such an event. 

I think we have no rational dependence except on God 
and ourselves ; nor can I yet be persuaded, that Great 
Britain has either wisdom, virtue, or magnanimity enough 
to adopt a perfect and liberal system of conciliation. If 
they again thought they could conquer us, they would 
again attempt it. 

We are, nevertheless, thank God, in a better situation 
than we have been. As our independence is acknowledged 
by Britain, every obstacle to our forming treaties with 
neutral powers, and receiving their merchant ships, is at an 
end, so that we may carry on the war with greater advan- 
tage than before, in case our negotiations for peace should 
be fruitless.

It is not my meaning, and therefore I ho I ill not 

be understood to mean, that \\ 

from our treaty with France : our honour and our int< 

are concerned in inviolably adhering t" it. 1 mean • 

to say, that if we lean <>u her love of liberty, her a; 

for America, or her disinterested magnanimity, we shall 

lean on a broken reed, that will. r or he . ■ -nr 

hands, and Geneva as well as Corsica justifies tins ol 

vation. 

I have written many disagreeable things in this letter, 
but I thought it my duty. I have also deviated from my 
instructions, which, though not to be justified, will, I h 
be excused, on account of the singular and unforeseen cir- 
cumstances which occasioned it. 

Let me a^ain recommend secrecy, and believe me to 
dear sir, &c.
