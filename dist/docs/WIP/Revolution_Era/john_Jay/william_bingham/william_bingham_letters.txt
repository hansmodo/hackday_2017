Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just heard that a French packet is on the point of 
departure for New-York. I cannot permit it to sail without forwarding you a few 
lines expressive of the pleasure I received on hearing of your safe arrival. 
</p><p>
The services you have rendered your country will naturally secure you a very welcome reception. 
</p><p>
The only circumstance that can be productive of disagreeable sensations is the situation of your State, exposed 
to such political convulsions. However, I hope it will soon be restored to harmony and good- tern per. 
</p><p>
I hope your public appointment will prove an agreeable 
surprise to you on your arrival, and that you will be able to 
reconcile the acceptance of it to every consideration of 
private interest and convenience, as well as public duty. 
</p><p>
The British seem to recede every day more and more 
from the paths to conciliation. A certain nation, to whom 
we are indebted for political favours, will endeavour to 
cherish this disposition, as she is sure to benefit by such 
growing feuds and divisions. 
</p><p>
From the observations I have made since my arrival 
here, I can discover the necessity of very complying conduct on the part of those Americans who have public business to transact with this court. 
</p><p>
Such conformity to the opinions of others is not easily reconcilable to the feelings and manly deportment of republicans. 
</p><p>
No one is better acquainted than you are with the system of this court, and no one is more jealous of their country's honour, in essential points. 
</p><p>
You may well imagine, then, that your appointment was 
not regarded with satisfaction, nor will the congratulations 
that you will receive on it from certain persons be sincere. 
</p><p>
With great esteem and regard, believe me to be, 
</p><p>
Dear sir, 
Your sincere friend and obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
