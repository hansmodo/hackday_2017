Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I congratulate you, sir, upon your appointment to represent the American States at the court of Madrid ; the just 
testimony of that confidence which the honourable body you have presided over, have in your abilities and integrity. 
May health, success, and every felicity accompany you; but, while I am sensible of the advantages we shall reap 
from your eminent services there, I have my fears that they will be missed, importantly, where you now are ; and that 
the spirit of party, almost laid to sleep, will revive upon your absence. I cordially wish you may be able to heal 
the new-made breach between Spain and Britain, since France appears disposed to peace, and I am mistaken if the 
court of London are not ready to make up with us, if nothing respecting our allies hinders it. Indeed we want 
an honourable peace ; but I hope there lives not a wretch who wishes it upon terms of dishonour to our noble allies. 
I am, sir, with unfeigned regard, 
</p><p>
Your most obliged and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
