Dear Jay, 
</p><p>
Congress have sent me here, in conjunction with some other gentlemen, to regulate their army, and in truth not a 
little regulation hath become necessary. Our quartermaster and commissary departments are in the most lamentable situation. Opportunities have been neglected last 
campaign which were truly golden ones, but omnipotent fatality had, it seems, determined that the American capital 
should fall. Our sentiments on this occasion are so perfectly coincident that I will not enlarge. The mighty Senate 
of America is not what you have known it. The continental currency and Congress have both depreciated, but in 
the hands of the Almighty Architect of empires, the stone which the builders have rejected may easily become head 
of the corner. The free, open, and undisturbed communication with the city of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> debauches the minds 
of those in its vicinage with astonishing rapidity. O, this State is sick even unto the death, and in Sir William they 
have certainly got a most damnable physician. Just before 
the reduction of the forts, the enemy balanced exactly upon 
the point of quitting the city, and a straw w r ould have 
turned in either scale. Our troops ; Heu miseros ! The skeleton of an army presents itself to our eyes in a naked, 
starving condition, out of health, out of spirits. But I have seen Fort George in the summer of <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. Next 
campaign I believe we shall banish these troublesome fellows. For Heaven's sake, my dear friend, exert yourself 
strenuously in the great leading business of taxation. To 
that great wheel "a thousand petty spokes and small annexments are morticed and adjoined." I earnestly entreat you 
and my other friends, fortia opponere pectora to that fatal 
system of limitation, which, if carried into execution, would 
be downright ruin, and in the ineffectual attempt will carry 
us to the brink of it. Yorktown and its neighbourhood
although nearly ninety miles from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, already considers our money almost as waste paper. At taverns, 
take as specimen the following rates : breakfast and supper each, seven shillings and sixpence ; dinner, ten shillings ; 
one night's hay for one horse, seven shillings and sixpence; oats, per quart, one shilling ; toddy, per bowl, ten shillings ; 
rum, per gill, seven shillings and sixpence; wine, per bottle, from thirty to forty shillings, and the like ; you will observe 
this is proclamation. Hay, they tell me, hath been sold in some places at £20 proc. per ton. My love to Livingston. 
I shall write to him by this opportunity, if I can find time to send a long letter, which, indeed, I owe him. Remember me to Mrs. Jay, and believe me, yours,

DEAR Jay, 
</p><p>
I won't dispute who has written most. I have written more than twice what you acknowledge to have received, but this is of no consequence. 
</p><p>
I am sorry for your session, but I wished you had marked out what taxes have been laid, what salaries given, and a 
few more striking outlines of legislation. These, with what I know of your men, would have enabled me to imagine proper lights and shades. 
</p><p>
I choose that my friends should write freely, and those 
who know me must know that such freedoms need no 
apology. I never thought the person you allude to so 
steady as could be wished. We have all of us our weak 
sides ; would to God that were the worst. 
</p><p>
What you mention relative to our plan of rights shall be 
attended to. I am a busy man, though, as heretofore, a 
pleasurable one. 
</p><p>
Let your governor cleanse the Augean stable in his State, 
which no public body would do though it stink under their 
noses. I am labouring at arrangements of various kinds. 
God prosper me, and give me patience and industry. It 
was a good wish from one who knew my wants. 
</p><p>
We have ordered troops from the highlands, but we will 
send thither a general, who shall be empowered to call forth 
the swarms of the eastern hive. Men were necessary at 
the <a href='/results.php?city=valley forge' rel='city'>Valley Forge</a>. I have a good knack at guessing. I 
guess the enemy won't attempt Hudson River. 
</p><p>
I do think of Vermont : and unless I mistake, matters 
shall be managed to effect, without bellowing in the forum, 
which I believe hath been a little too much the case. But 
why should I blame impetuous vivacity, — hath it never led 
me into an error ? 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=isp" rel="">Putnam</a> will soon be tried. The affair of <a href="/results.php?tla=pjs" rel="">Schuyler</a> and <a href="/results.php?tla=arc" rel="">St. Clair</a> laboured under awkward circumstances. Their 
friends and their enemies appear to me to have been equally 
blind. I enclose extracts from the minutes made the other 
night to possess myself of the real state of facts. There are 
some other entries from time to time. It was erroneous to 
order a committee simply to collect facts ; they should have 
been directed to state charges. This morning, my colleague 
being absent, I got a committee appointed for the latter 
purpose : Sherman, Dana (Massachusetts), and <a href="/results.php?tla=wid" rel="">Drayton</a> (South Carolina). This was unanimous, and yet I would 
have undertaken to argue for it in a style which would absolutely have ruined the measure. You know it would have 
been easy to say, justice to those injured gentlemen, instead 
of justice to an injured country requires, &c. 
</p><p>
Great Britain seriously means to treat. Our affairs are 
most critical, though not dangerously so. If the minister 
from France were present as well as him from England, I 
am a blind politician if the thirteen States (with their extended territory), would not be in peaceable possession of 
their independence three months from this day. As it is, 
expect a long war. I believe it will not require such astonishing efforts after this campaign to keep the enemy at bay. 
Probably a treaty is signed with the house of Bourbon ere 
this ; if so, a spark hath fallen upon the train which is to 
fire the world. Ye gods ! what havoc doth ambition make 
among your works. 
My dear friend, adieu. My love to your wife, Remember me to all my friends of every rank" and sex. 
</p><p>
I am yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=gom" rel="me">Gouverneur Morris</a>.

P.S. I meant to have said, the present is within the 
spirit of our constitution, a special occasion.

Dear Jay, 
</p><p>
I write to acknowledge your letter of the 24th September. Being uncertain where you are, and consequently 
what course this letter may take, and through what hands 
it will pass, I shall not say so much as I otherwise might. 
I will direct to the care of <a href="/results.php?tla=ben" rel="colleague">Dr. Franklin</a>. 
</p><p>
Your attachment to America, when removed from it, is 
the old story of travellers ; but when it comes from one in whose feelings we feel an interest, decies repetita placebit. 
Of your health you speak despondingly, yet you say your spirits are good. Believe me, my friend, good spirits will 
both make and preserve good health. I mean to extend the observation generally, but not universally. Whatever lot 
betides us, I wish you at least one happy year, and I hope that Heaven will do you the justice to grant a long succession of them. Make my good wishes acceptable to Mrs. Jay, and present me tenderly to your children. 
</p><p>
I was lately in New-York, and have the pleasure to tell you that all your friends were well. Things there are now 
in that kind of ferment which was rationally to have been expected ; and I think the superior advantages of our constitution will now appear in the repressing of those turbulent spirits who wish for confusion, because that in the 
regular order of things they can only fill a subordinate sphere. 
</p><p>
This country has never yet been known to Europe, and God knows whether it ever will be so. To England it is 
less known than to any other part of Europe ; because they constantly view it through a medium either of prejudice or of faction. True it is, that the general government 
wants energy ; and equally true it is that this want will eventually be supplied. A national spirit is the natural result of national existence ; and although some of the present 
generation may feel colonial oppositions of opinion, that generation will die away, and give place to a race of Americans. On this occasion, as on others, Great Britain 
is our best friend ; and by seizing the critical moment when we were about to divide, she has shown clearly the dreadful consequences of division. You will find that the States 
are coming into resolutions on the subject of commerce ; which, if they had been proposed by Congress on the plain reason of the thing, would have been rejected with resentment, and perhaps contempt. 
</p><p>
With respect to our taste for luxury, do not grieve about it. Luxury is not so bad a thing as it is often supposed to 
be ; and if it were, still we must follow the course of tidings, and turn to advantage what exists, since we have not the 
power to annihilate or create. The very definition of luxury is as difficult as the suppression of it. 
</p><p>
Do not condemn us till you see us. Do not ask the British to take off their foolish restrictions. Let them 
alone, and they will be obliged to do it themselves. While the present regulation exists, it does us more of political good than it can possibly do of commercial evil. 
</p><p>
Adieu. Believe me always, yours, 
</p><p>

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am too much occupied to find time for the use of a cipher, and in effect, the government here is so much occupied with their own affairs, that in transmitting to you a 
letter under an envelope, there is no risk. This, however, I am pretty certain will go safe. The States-general have 
now been a long time in session, and have done nothing hitherto. They have been engaged in a dispute, whether 
they shall form one body or three. The commons, who are represented by a number equal to both the others, and 
who besides have at least one-half the representatives of the clergy, insist on forming a single house. They have 
succeeded. But the nobles deeply feel their situation. The king, after siding with them, was frightened into an abandonment of them. He acts now from terror only. The 
soldiery in this city, particularly the French guards, declare they will not act against the people. They are now 
treated by the mobility, and parade about the streets drunk, huzzaing for the Tiers. Some of them have, in consequence, 
been confined, not by the force, but by the adroitness of authority. Last night this circumstance became known, 
and immediately a mob repaired to the prison. The soldiers on guard unfixed their bayonets, and joined the assailants. A party of dragoons, ordered on duty to disperse 
the riot, thought it better to drink with the rioters, and return back to their quarters. The soldiers, with others 
confined in the same prison, were then paraded in triumph to the Palais Royal, which is now the liberty pole of this 
city, and there they celebrated, as usual, their joy. Probably this evening some other prisons will be opened, for 
" Liberte" is now the general cry, and " autorite" is a name, not a real existence. 
</p><p>
The court are about to form a camp in the neighbourhood of Paris, of 25,000 men, under the command of the Marechal de Broglio. I do not know him personally, 
therefore cannot judge what may be expected from his talents ; but all my information goes to the point, that 
he will never bring his army to act against the people. 
The Guard du Corps are as warm adherents (in general) to 
the Tiers as anybody else, strange as that may seem ; so 
that in effect the sword has slipped out of the monarch's 
hands, without his perceiving a tittle of the matter. All 
these things in a nation not yet fitted by education and 
habit for the enjoyment of freedom, gives one frequent suspicions that they will indeed greatly overshoot their mark, 
if indeed they have not already done it. Already some 
people talk of limiting the king's negative upon the laws. 
And as they have hitherto felt severely the authority exercised in the name of their princes, every limitation of that 
authority seems to them desirable. Xever having felt the 
evils of too weak an executive, the disorders to be apprehended from anarchy make, as yet. no impression. 
</p><p>
The provincial assemblies or administrations, in other 
words, the popular executive of the provinces, which Turgot 
had imagined as a means of moderating the regal legislative 
of the court, is now insisted on as a counter security against 
the monarch, when they shall have established a democratical legislative, for you will observe that the noble and clerical 
orders are henceforth to be vox et preeterea nihil. The 
king is to be limited to the exact sum needful for his personal expenses. The management of the public debt, and 
revenues to provide for it, will be taken entirely out of his 
hands, and the subsistence of the army is to depend on temporary grants. Hence it must follow, that his negative, in 
whatever form reserved, will be of little avail. These are 
the outlines of the proposed constitution, by which at the 
same time lettres de cachet are to be abrogated, and the 
liberty of the press established. 
</p><p>
My private opinion is, that the king, to get fairly out of the 
scrape in which he finds himself, would subscribe to any 
thing ; and truly from him little is to be expected in any way. 
The queen, hated, humbled, mortified, feels, and feigns, and 
intrigues to save some shattered remnants of the royal authority ; but to know that she favours a measure is the certain 
means to frustrate its success. The Count D'Artois, alike 
hated, is equally busy, but has neither sense to counsel himself, nor choose counsellors for himself, much less to counsel 
others. The nobles look up to him for support, and lean on 
what they know to be a broken reed, for want of some more 
solid dependence. In their anguish, they curse Neckar, 
who is, in fact, less the cause than the instrument of their sufferings. His popularity depends now more on the opposition 
he meets with from one party, than any serious regard of 
the other. It is the attempt to throw him down which saves 
him from falling. He has no longer the preponderating 
weight in council, which a fortnight ago decided every 
thing. If they were not afraid of consequences, he would 
be dismissed ; and, on the same principle, the king has refused to accept his resignation. If his abilities were equal 
to his genius, and he were as much supported by firmness 
as he is swayed by ambition, he would have had the exalted 
honour of giving a free constitution to above twenty millions of his fellow-creatures, and would have reigned long 
in their hearts, and received the unanimous applause of 
posterity. But as it is, he must soon fall. Whether his 
exit will be physical or moral, must depend on events 
which I cannot foresee. The best chance that royalty has 
is, that popular excesses may alarm. At the rate in which 
things are now going, the king of France must soon be one 
of the most limited monarchs in Europe. Adieu.

My dear Friend, 
</p><p>
Last Tuesday evening my wife was delivered of a boy. I communicate that event because I believe it will give you 
pleasure. Moreover, I wish you to be one of his godfathers. True it is, thai according to the usual course, you may not 
be able to perform the duties of that office ; but, my friend should you be mingled with the dust, he shall learn from the 
history of your life, that a man must be truly pious to be truly great. I do not fix the day, because I wish you 
to come on in a fortnight or three weeks, when it best suits your convenience. I will then summon the priest and the other sponsors. 
</p><p>
Yours truly, 
</p><p>
