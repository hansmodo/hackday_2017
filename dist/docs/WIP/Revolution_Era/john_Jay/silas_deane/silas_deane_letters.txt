Sir, 
</p><p>
I called at your lodgings in November last, but your servant told me you was not within, and that you intended 
to set out for Bath in a day or two ; on which, being exceedingly desirous of an interview with you, I sent you a 
letter requesting that favour; but going out of town myself a few days after, and having received no answer, I am at 
a loss what to conclude on, whether my letter might have failed, or that you do not incline to favour me with an interview ; and hence I am induced to trouble you with this, 
and to request that you will simply inform me by a line, if you received my letter of November, and if an interview 
will be agreeable or not. I wish to obviate and remove any late prejudices which you may have entertained against 
me, from the most gross misrepresentations of my conduct since my arrival in England ; and I submit to you the propriety of giving me an opportunity for doing this ; and am, 
with great respect, sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=sid" rel="me">Silas Deane</a>.
