Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
When I sent you, as a token of my constant remembrance, my melange about the Tunis sheep, I intended to 
have written a letter to accompany it. But it seems that 
nothing must go with a pamphlet but the mere direction, 
under the pains and penalties of sousing the correspondent 
or addressee in all costs of enormous postage. It is really 
true, that now, for nearly six years, I have abandoned wine 
and all stimulants, segars and rich food included. Every 
thing increasing and accelerating the blood is hostile to my 
health, and produces my constitutional malady, an accumulation of blood on the brain. This will, at the appointed 
time, produce my French-leave of all sublunary things. 
Finding that health and rich living were incompatible, I 
took the resolution to abandon old habits, and have sacredly 
kept it. I find myself, without abstemiousness in plain food, 
healthy generally, and, what I think contributes much to 
preserve health, innocently cheerful. I have now and then 
(in winter the worst) attacks of vertigo, which cupping 
or the lancet, timely applied, remove. This, you may 
say, is a history of my secrets. You and I are on a par in 
age and other circumstances, and may trust one another. 
</p><p>
Speltz is an excellent and useful grain. You can see an 
account of it in our first volume, p. 260. I have often 
sowed it ; but, unless you are near a shelling-mill, you must 
give it to your horses. I abandoned the culture of it only 
because I had to send it a great distance for this operation. 
There is a great variety. Some produces whiter flour than 
wheat; some as black as rye. Apropos: General Armstrong sent from Paris to me about two quarts of the most 
extraordinary rye I ever beheld. Under my rage for diffusion, I gave away, in all quarters of our State, spoonfuls, 
till I left myself only half a pint, which is now vigorously 
growing. I wrote to him to procure a tierce or hogshead 
for me ; but I suppose my letter miscarried. I shall renew 
my request now he has got back to us. If he can spread 
this rye plentifully through our country, he will do more 
good than all our intercourse with the French Belial has 
done harm. The flour of this rye is like that of wheat, and 
it weighs sixty-four or sixty-live pounds per bushel. All 
our rye has depreciated here. You must make to me some 
grains of allowance for my antithesis about French intercourse ; for this has done more harm than all their rye is 
worth. I find myself with a wry face whenever I think of 
our Gallic prostrations. 
</p><p>
Our second volume is nearly finished. 1 have been 
obliged to write too much, to fill up the chasms. It is too 
Herculean a task to keep alive agricultural publications, 
and I shall give up a labour which rolls back on me like 
the stone of Sisyphus. I have just sent the preface to the 
press. You will see that for lack of a more tangible monument to our departed Confucius, I have erected one out of 
my ink-pot, with a goose's feather. You may say, when 
you see it, that any one could tell the feather belonged to a 
goose ; but it will prove the scarcity of agricultural matter 
even for a preface. With all this, I think it will be a good 
publication, and much better than I expected. The great 
desideratum is, to get people to read such books. I have 
published with the memoirs — as the players say. by particular desire — my plaster book, newly vamped. Being 
tormented by excuses to dozens of requests to obtain new 
facts on plaster — the thorough-bass being dread of criticism — I have told a story for the petty critics in the preface 
(pushed for matter) which will probably bring the wasps 
on me, and not procure a single correspondent to satisfy 
my agricultural curiosity. When it is finished I will send 
it to you. I sincerely wish you may pass a better winter 
than you seem to express a hope of experiencing, amd am, 
Most affectionately, yours, 
</p><p>

P.S. Turn Pandora's box bottom upwards, and get hope 
out first. Dr. Logan called on me with a new-invented micrometer, to measure the filaments of wool, whereof he was 
the bearer for our society. The filament sent with the 
instrument was T oYo o parts of an inch in fineness, and no 
doubt selected. My Tunis wool is considerably finer. He 
says they find in England that they have over-manufactured, and the rage is turning to agriculture. There is no 
bullion, and paper has depreciated. He saw store cattle 
that would not sell here for more than 815, sell at fairs for 
£15 sterling in paper. A milch cow and calf, worth here 
$25, sold for £20 sterling. A universal wish to be in 
friendship with us was expressed by all people of all grades 
in society. Lord Wellesley told him that he had in his office 
proofs of an offer from Bonaparte, to divide this country 
with England. He gives me many entertaining pieces of 
information which my paper obliges me to omit.

My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your very welcome letter of the 9th inst. I received 
at the moment I was contemplating sending to you our 
third volume of Agricultural Memoirs, as a small token of 
remembrance. I shall, by the first opportunity, have it forwarded to you. A few of us endeavour to keep this subject alive amid the din of. arms, which are ever hostile to 
the arts of peace and their attendant blessings. Too much 
of this effort falls on me ; but yet some relief from surrounding glooms is found in attention to topics which abstract 
the mind from the vices and follies plentifully scattered 
throughout our devoted country. Mortification under what 
we arc, is at least for the moment suspended, while we contemplate on what we have been. It may return with double 
force, when we consider what we might have been. 
</p><p>
But it seems that history affords ample proofs, and ours 
as much as any other, that " this world was made for 
ir." The enjoyment of liberty is fugacious ; but despotism, under a variety of shapes, is permanent. There is 
a tendency to it in all human political institutions ; and the 
people of every country have, from time immemorial, forged 
their own chains. Our " free and enlightened" citizens are 
now very busy at the anvil ; but whether their work will 
now be completed, is not for us to decide. Heaven may 
send us chastisement without ruin, and possibly the former 
may save us for a time. Delusion is the order of the day. 
Gordon, in one of his discourses on Tacitus, endeavours to 
prove that the people, when deceived by dehulers, are blind 
and cruel, yet mean well. Too many of our people are 
blind, yet few cruel ; as to their meaning well, they take a 
lamentable mode of showing it. 
</p><p>
Your letter contains an epitome of my thoughts on our 
political situation. Had I written a book (and I have no 
adversary who would think it worth his while to wish that 
I had), I could not express myself more clearly on the subject. At our age we are lookers-on, and see the game 
better than those who play it. The insight which calm 
observation and experience afford is, however, of no use to 
those who deem themselves too wise to need instruction. 
We must wait events, like passengers in a bark buffeted 
by storms, and mismanaged by unskilful pilots and mariners. 
I hope our vessel is yet stanch, and that she will get into 
port, whatever untoward appearances may predict. It is 
indeed distressing when hope alone is our comforter. But, 
alas ! all I know is far from furnishing light or brilliancy to 
the threatening and dusky cloud which overhangs our 
hemisphere. 
</p><p>
Our president is not the man we once supposed him. Party antipathies may possibly paint in too sombre colours; 
but the stories I hear are distressing, particularly to me, who in early times had a sincere personal friendship for him. 
He would then take some strange flights : one of them was his joining in the philippic against you, for not consulting 
the French minister (Vergennes), when the interest of your country forbade the step. But, in general, I thought and 
acted with him. In this matter, far otherwise ; nor have I, in his modern conduct, been in union with his political 
sentiments on any important subject, although I entertain no personal enmity. 
</p><p>
I have a strong impression that we shall, ere long, have 
peace ; but the why and the wherefore I cannot tell, save 
that there seems nothing really substantial enough in the 
litigated affairs of the two nations, to continue the business 
of throat-cutting ; and I fancy our enemy is tired of the 
employment, after following the trade so long. 
</p><p>
I am gratified with the account of your travelling on 
towards the goal we all must arrive at, with a mind tranquil, and a body without pain. Your companions — books 
and recollections — are consolatory and essential, when all 
others have lost their relish. 
</p><p>
I thank you for your kind inquiries about my health. I 
have but lately recovered from a most unfortunate accident, having been thrown on the stones of our turnpike 
from my horse, who took fright and ran away with me. 
He was a Kentucky racer (a quality I did not know), and 
no doubt took his revenge for his countrymen, by chastising me for my bad politics. I had three trenched gashes 
in my pericranium ; yet I escaped becoming crack-brained, 
which may be reckoned uncivil, as it is fashionable nowadays, at least, among politicians ; and it is the ton to be in 
the fashion. Believe me always 
</p><p>
Most affectionately yours, 
</p><p>

My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Although our correspondence is rare, my most sincere 
regards for you are uninterrupted. I have outlived, and so 
have you, so many old friends and contemporaries, that the 
very few left are the more valuable for their scarcity ; new 
acquaintances I make the most of, but old and valued friends 
delight me with solid enjoyments, more easily felt than described ; and yet in what is called society, a bystander would 
suppose that I never had any other than the companions of the 
day. I seldom mix with what is now called convivial society ; 
but though an inveterate water-drinker, I can keep pace with 
such society by sympathy. I live with my old friends (not 
seldom with you) as the Swedenborgians do with departed 
spirits. Strong attachment, and zealous recollections work 
up the predisposed fancy into a belief of real presence. It 
is a pleasing delusion, which gray -bearded scrutiny, and 
what is called rational investigation should never extinguish. 
It is a most agreeable and fascinating cullibility, whereof it 
is more wise than foolish to become the willing and unresisting dupe. 
</p><p>
I have continued in my judicial employment more from 
habit than inclination, and it is at times burdensome, and 
always ill requited. I see Congress are about new-modelling 
the department, and what they will make of it, I do not 
know (possibly they do not themselves know), nor do I feel 
much anxiety on the subject. The whole state of things 
is so different from what we in our day contemplated, that 
it is more surprising our judicial arrangements, formed in 
the early stage of our national existence, should have continued so long and so effectively, than that they should now 
be changed. 
</p><p>
My attention to my judicial duty has abstracted me from 
my private affairs ; which arc. however, tree from the embarrassments which have overwhelmed many adventurers, 
who had better have been idle. My thorough-bass amusement 
consists in rural enjoyments, which have been more profitable to others than myself. I have given you a specimen 
of this kind of enjoyment by directing our fourth volume of 
Memoirs to be sent to you, and I hope it will arrive safely 
to your hands. There may not be much instruction, but 
we have assisted in raising our fellow-citizens to proper 
views of the real and substantial interests of our country. 
There is a most gratifying spirit everywhere on this subject, 
by which the rising generation may profit ; but it is too late 
in the day for either you or I to enjoy much of its advantages. So we thought, however, in our revolutionary 
exertions, and yet what a mass of prosperity and happiness 
have we lived to see accumulated in every quarter of our 
country ! When I carry my recollections back to my early 
knowledge of its husbandry, the contrast exhibited by its 
present improvement (yet but imperfect) fills me with most 
pleasing sensations. 
</p><p>
There is a jealousy in our mother country still apparent 
of most of the rapid improvements we have arrived at; and 
I have strong expectations that those in agriculture will ere 
long equal, if not exceed all others. I keep up a good understanding with the British agricultural people with whom 
I come in contact; but it amuses me to perceive that, although many are liberal, many are otherwise. Some 
years ago we sent a volume of our memoirs to Scotland. 
It was very civilly received ; but several of their leading agricultors took occasion to observe that we were an hundred 
years behind them, and even very unequal to English farming. So I left Sawney and John Bull to settle that 
point. I sent lately an American scythe and cradle, which 
they had not before seen ; nor was it used in England. 
They received it graciously ; and I had civil thanks from 
a vice-president of the Board of Agriculture : but he at 
the same time let me know that it was a Flemish, and not 
an American implement. I desired my friend who transmitted the cold civility, to have it labelled "a Flemish implement, sent to England by the way of the United States 
of America /" There is an awkward instrument in Flanders 
containing the rudiments of our scythe and cradle, but as 
unequal to ours as their ships to those of our country ; yet 
ours are American ships^and not a little envied and 
squinted at. 
</p><p>
I have been lately reading, with great pleasure, the Life of 
our late distinguished friend <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague'>Dr. Franklin</a>. Have you read 
it ? I see he glosses over in a letter to the then secretary for 
foreign affairs (Livingston) the affair of Vergennes sending 
his secretary to England, pending our negotiations in the 
treaty of peace. I think you told me all about it ; and I 
have ever had different impressions from those the Dr. 
portrays. He says it was merely to ascertain whether or 
not the British ministry had serious intentions to make an 
equal, solid, and lasting peace with us and our allies. I have 
always believed there was an underplot in the business. I 
think something of this appears in your journal, which I 
assisted to read in Congress in <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a> and 3. Much bruit 
was made then by the French diplomacy, about your signing the preliminaries without previous notice to them ; but 
I always thought you entirely in the right, not only as a security in so important a measure, but to guard against embarrassments, with reason apprehended from the French manoeuvres. I voted against an unwarrantable philippic of censure, brought forward in Congress against your conduct, to 
please the French. I thought then, and do now, that it was 
a mean compliance. Our friend <a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague'>Madison</a>, who was generally then with us, left his friends on this subject, and I never liked him the better for it. 
</p><p>
I see Congress have rejected the claim of Beaumachi'fl 
representatives. All my recollections put them in the right 
in so doing. True, <a href='/results.php?tla=sid' rel='colleague'>Silas Deane</a> made an ostensible private 
contract with B. ; but I always was taught to believe him a mere showman, and that the supplies were a gift from France, 
which she could not openly then avow. The unaccounted money, about which much noise has been made, I always believed to have been devoted to secret service and douceurs 
to French agents, whose remunerations could not publicly appear. All or most of the articles went through my hands, 
or under my observation, when in the war office, and a more complete piece of fripponerie never was seen. Very many 
of the articles were worthless, and among them the brass cannon were old rampart pieces, only valuable for the metal, 
which was recast in our foundries. All these things, however, appear now as dreams. What is real, and lives longer 
than these transactions in my memory, is, that I am always, 
and have been, truly and affectionately yours,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Every occurrence in which you have shared, or originated, seems, by some strange perversion, to be misunderstood or misstated by the present generation, when some 
favourite individual or topic induces the obliquity. Although I give <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague'>Mr. Adams</a> his full share of merit in the 
affair of the Count de Vergennes' manoeuvring with the 
British administration on the subject of our treaty of <a href='/results.php?year=1783'>1783</a>, 
yet I have felt indignant that your name should have been 
omitted in the Massachusetts' Conventional account of the 
matter ; and <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague'>Mr. Adams</a> held out as the principal figure, 
when you should have been the prominent and leading 
portrait in the group. I am sure Mr. Vaughan will not 
justify this statement of the transaction, though he is alluded 
to as confirming it by one of the speakers in the Massachusetts' Convention. His account of it to me was exactly 
as you stated it in your letter to Congress, which I and read at the time of its being the subject of our consideration; when, as I wrote to you, the unjustifiable vi 
Mas taken as to the unmerited censure of proceeding without the concurrence of the French ministry, in our adjustment with Great Britain. 
</p><p>
In your letter to me, in answer to my relation of what 
passed at this place in a conversation with Mr. Vaughan, 
a year or more ago, in relation to the affair, and when 
I told you he confirmed my recollections on the subject, you only refer to your letter to Congress. I think 
some additional statement of facts should be left, lest the 
archives of the office of state may suffer the catastrophe 
which destroyed all the records of transactions in the war 
office. The truth of history depends on fair and correct 
relations of the conduct of individuals to whom public 
transactions were committed. The biography of those individuals is one thing, the national character is another ; 
but both are united in the inquiry on this subject. 
</p><p>
Among the pleasures of memory (which has many pains) 
the recollection of old friendships is one of the most delightful. Among these, my remembrances of your personal 
regard is one of the most prominent gratifications. Whensoever any thing turns up in which you were concerned, 
all my sensibilities recur. 
</p><p>
I begin to feel some of the infirmities of age ; but, in 
general, am highly favoured with good health. The most 
extraordinary depression of property is no cordial to 
landed proprietors ; but those who will soon occupy a 
small portion, and leave their extensive possessions behind 
them, need not much deplore the "hard times" which have 
fallen on us. The friends of peace have nothing to encourage them, when universal peace brings along with it universal privation, and much distress to individuals. But we 
have wantoned in prosperity : and cannot bear the check which circumstances have given to our career — -festinalentc must hereafter be our motto. I trust you enjoy as 
much health as you have heretofore experienced, though I 
cannot flatter myself that it is perfect. My best wishes 
constantly attend you ; and I beg you to be assured of the 
sincere regard with which I am always 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=rcp" rel="me">Richard Peters</a>. 
</p><p>
P.S. I have just got home from the drudgery of a long 
circuit court, and am not the better for the campaign. 
Washington has begun his return to <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, much 
broken down. He came convalescent ; having had a 
severe attack of an illness which pervaded all the country 
in his vicinity. He must renew his stamina, or he will not 
reach the period of life to which you and I have arrived.
