Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I must freely acknowledge the justice of your charge 
against me as a bad correspondent, for the force of truth 
would convict, were I to deny, and perhaps friendship will 
hardly bear with palliatives ; but knowing well your attachment to, and practice of sincerity, I shall honestly tell you I 
did not like to write on political matters, and in what may 
be called domestic, you had constantly better information 
than 'twas possible for me to give, having also very ample 
employment for my time : you will reflect, that all these 
circumstances combined to make me silent, although not 
inattentive or forgetful of my friends abroad. 
</p><p>
I have three letters from you, dated the 28th May, 16th 
September, and 19th November last, and feel myself exceedingly indebted to that partiality which prompted you to 
say many civil things ; these are stamped with an unusual 
value, not because I sutler myself to think they are merited, 
but because you thought so. We have heard more of you 
and Mrs. Jay than these letters tell me, and upon the whole 
have not found much cause to be pleased with your situation. Hers must too often have been very disagreeable ; 
the loss of the little one was truly distressing, and your 
almost constant absence extremely hard. But you must 
comfort yourselves with the reflection that still more cruel 
things might have happened, had you remained in your own 
country. Suppose you had been with your father, when 
some of the enemy's ruffians broke into the house, and after 
satiating themselves with plunder, they had carried you, 
my dear friend, a prisoner to New- York. Think of the 
triumph of your enemies, the distress of your friends, and 
what you must, under such circumstances, have suffered : 
happy that you have escaped such an event, I will not 
prolong the idea of it. 
</p><p>
Our friend <a href='/results.php?tla=gom' rel='friend met colleague'>Gouverneur</a> has acquainted you with my appointment to be superintendant of finance ; the motives of 
my acceptance are purely patriotic, and I would this moment give much of my property to be excused ; but pressed 
by my friends, acquaintances, fellow-citizens, and almost 
by all America, I could not resist. I will therefore most 
assiduously try to be useful, and if in this I do but succeed, 
my recompense will be ample. <a href='/results.php?tla=gom' rel='friend met colleague'>Gouverneur</a> and others 
have promised me the assistance of their abilities. Congress promise support; if the Legislatures and individuals 
will do the same, we will soon change the face of our 
affairs, and show our enemies that their hopes of our ruin, 
through the channel of finance, is as vain as their hope of 
conquest. 
</p><p>
This campaign, as usual, opens to our disadvantage ; but 
I expect it will also, as usual, close favourably for us. The 
vices and follies of our enemies may justly be counted 
among the number of our fast friends. They never fail to 
work for our relief in the hour of distress ; for at those 
times the pride, insolence, and tyranny of the British heroes 
are too insufferable to be borne, even by the peasantry of 
America. It affords me much pleasure to find the assistance I have given towards delivering supplies at Havannah, 
is known and approved by the ministry at the court of 
Madrid; as a favourable impression there may be serviceable to my administration of the finances, and I hope still to 
return more important services for those T expect from 
them to this distressed country. Adieu, my dear sir: with 
sincere affection. I am 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You have not heard from me so often as you had a right 
to expect. I lament, but cannot help it. Constant employment puts it out of my power to do many things I wish to 
do, and that of writing to my friends is among the number. 
My private letters, however, cannot be of much consequence, and you must accept the will for the deed. 
</p><p>
I cannot take time at present to enter on any political 
discussions. But you must allow me to declare my perfect 
satisfaction in, and approbation of, your conduct in Europe. 
All who have had the opportunity of knowing what it has 
been, are struck with admiration at your patience under 
difficulties, and your firmness in rising superior to them. 
Go on, my friend ; you deserve and will receive the gratitude of your country. History will hand down your plaudit 
to posterity. The men of the present day, who are generally least grateful to their contemporaries, esteem it an 
honour to be of your acquaintance. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to hear that Mrs. Jay and yourself have been indisposed, but I hope you are recovered, and partaking 
the enjoyments of this season with the gay, sprightly inhabitants of Versailles and Paris. My best wishes ever attend you. 
</p><p>
Your friend <a href='/results.php?tla=gom' rel='friend met colleague'>Gouverneur</a> writes you political letters, but as he tells you nothing of himself, it is just that I tell you, how industrious, how useful he is ; his talents and abilities 
you know ; they are all faithfully and disinterestedly applied to the service of his country. I could do nothing without him, and our joint labours do but just keep the wheels in motion. 
</p><p>
With sincere attachment, 
</p><p>
I am, my dear sir,

My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I congratulate you on the signing of the definitive treaty.. 
and on the evacuation of New- York, which took place on 
Tuesday. Our friend <a href='/results.php?tla=gom' rel='friend met colleague'>Gouverneur Morris</a> is there. He 
has been gone about eighteen days, and I expect him back 
very soon ; he will then give you the detail, and inform you 
of such things as you may wish to know respecting any of 
your particular friends. 
</p><p>
If Great Britain persists in refusing admittance to our 
ships in their islands, they will probably have great cause 
to repent, for I shall not be surprised to see a general prohibition to the admittance of theirs into our ports ; and if 
such a measure is once adopted, they may find it very difficult to obtain any alteration, and in that case the advantages of carrying will be much against them. Should the 
court of France pursue the same policy, we shall fall in 
with the Dutch, and probably have more connexions in 
commerce with them than with any other people. I have 
received the prints of the rise and fall of the balloon. Pray 
cannot they contrive to send passengers with a man to 
steer the course, so as to make them the means of conveyance for despatches from one country to another, or 
must they only be sent for intelligence to the moon and 
clouds ? 
We are dismissing the remains of our army, and getting 
rid of expense, so that I hope to sec the end of my engagements before next May, but I doubt whether it will be in 
my power to observe that punctuality in performing them, 
which I wish and have constantly aimed at. 
</p><p>
I am sending some ships to China, in order to encourage 
others in the adventurous pursuits of commerce, and I wish 
to see a foundation laid for an American navy. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I hear your health is mended since the date of your last 
letter of the 20th July, and rejoice at it. Your distant 
friends suffer irreparable injury if you are indisposed to 
write; those who write so well should write often, and 
even your short letters say so much in so few words, that 
it is impossible not to wish for them, if longer ones cannot 
be had. I acknowledge the force of all your observations 
on my intended resignation, and know the necessity of perseverance so long as there is a prospect of being useful ; 
but you must also acknowledge that it is folly in the extreme to continue in the drudgery of office after you see 
clearly that the public cannot be benefited ; your own 
affairs suffering, your feelings daily wounded, and your 
reputation endangered by the malice and misrepresentation 
of envious and designing men. During the war, I was 
determined to go through with the work I had undertaken, 
and although my resignation was made before the signing 
of the provisional treaty was known, yet I made no hesitation to declare to a committee of Congress, that if the war 
lasted I would continue. The war, however, ceased — 
Congress feared to dismiss their army without some pay ; 
they had not money, and could only make payment by 
paper anticipation, and even this could not be effected 
without my assistance. I was urged to continue, and 
forced into that anticipation. The army was dispersed, 
and since their departure, the men who urged these measures most, and who are eternally at war with honour and 
integrity, have been continually employed in devising 
measures to prevent my being able to fulfil my engagements, in hopes of effecting my ruin in case of failure. I 
must, however, in justice to the majority of Congress, 
which has ever been composed of honest men, declare that 
the faction I allude to is but inconsiderable in numbers, 
although they make themselves of some consequence by 
this assiduity. You know the ****, &c. : I should disregard these men totally, if I found a disposition in the 
several Legislatures to support national faith, credit, and 
character ; but, unhappily, there is at present a total inattendon on their parts. I am, however, persuaded, that 
sooner or later, the good sense of America will prevail, and 
that our governments will be intrusted in the hands of men 
whose principles will lead them to do justice, and whose 
understandings w T ill teach the value of national credit. 
This may be too long in coming to pass, at least for me, 
and therefore you may rest assured, that I quit all public 
employ the moment my engagements are fulfilled. 
</p><p>
The court of France having refused the last sum asked, 
I do not wish to trouble them further. I am not sensible 
of having at any time made an improper application, either 
as to substance or manner. Those who are solicited in 
such cases, are in the situation to make whatever objections 
they find convenient. I wish, however, that the ministers 
in France were sensible of one truth, which is, that my administration either saved them a good deal of money, or a 
great deal of disgrace ; for if I had not undertaken it when 
I did, they must either have advanced ten times the amount 
I received, or have deserted America, after having undertaken her cause, and perhaps have been obliged to subscribe 
to very indifferent terms of peace for themselves. 
</p><p>
It is happy for me that the loan in Holland stepped in to 
our relief, after the refusal of the court to grant the moderate sum of 3,000,000 livres as the concluding point. This 
refusal was ill-timed and impolitic. I could show resentment with some effect, if I were so disposed ; but so far 
from it, I retain a grateful remembrance of past favours, 
and make a point to promote the commercial intercourse 
between France and this country. I must also show my 
sense of the obligations conferred on us by the Hollanders. 
We hear that the definitive treaty is signed. I long to see 
it ; for you may depend that unless some new articles are 
added respecting our intercourse with the British West 
Indies, it will be both a work of difficulty and time to carry 
measures that will justify your opinion of us. I thank you 
for the kind sentiments which you express of me in several 
parts of your letters. I will endeavour to deserve them. 
I do not know whether <a href='/results.php?tla=gom' rel='friend met colleague'>Gouverneur</a> writes to you by this 
opportunity ; you must cherish his friendship, it is worth 
possessing, lie has more virtue than he shows, and more 
consistency than anybody believes. He values you exceedingly, and hereafter you will be very useful to each other. 
Mrs. Morris will write to Mrs. Jay, and say for herself 
what she has to say ; though I don't believe she will tell 
her, as she docs to everybody else, the high estimation in 
which she holds Mrs. Jay and yourself. Permit me also, 
my worthy friend, to assure you both of the sincerity of 
that affection with which I profess myself 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
