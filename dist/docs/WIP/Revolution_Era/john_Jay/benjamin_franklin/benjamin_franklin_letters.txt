Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yesterday, and not before, is come to hand your favour of April 14th, with the packets and despatches from Congress, &c, which you sent me by a French gentleman to Nantes. 
</p><p>
Several of them appear to have been opened, the paper 
round the seals being smoked and burnt, as with the flame 
of a candle used to soften the wax, and the impression 
defaced. The curiosity of people in this time of war is 
unbounded. Some of them only want to see news, but 
others want to find (through interested views) what chance 
there is of a speedy peace. Mr. Ross has undertaken to 
forward the letters to England. I have not seen them ; but 
he tells me they have all been opened. I am glad, however, 
to receive the despatches from Congress, as they communicate to me <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Adams's</a> instructions, and other particulars 
of which I have been long ignorant. 
</p><p>
I am very sensible of the weight of your observation, 
" that a constant interchange of intelligence and attentions 
between the public servants at the different courts, are 
necessary to procure to their constituents all the advantages 
capable of being derived from their appointment." I shall 
endeavour to perform my part with you, as well to have 
the pleasure of your correspondence, as from a sense of 
duty. But my time is more taken up with matters extraneous to the functions of a minister, than you can possibly 
imagine. I have written often to the Congress to establish 
consuls in the ports, and ease me of what relates to maritime and mercantile affairs ; but no notice has yet been taken of my request. 
</p><p>
A number of bills of exchange, said to be drawn by 
order of Congress on Mr. Laurens, are arrived in Holland. 
A merchant there has desired to know of me, whether, if 
he accepts them, I will engage to reimburse him. I have 
no orders or advice about them from Congress ; do you 
know to what amount they have drawn ? I doubt I cannot 
safely meddle with them. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Jay does me much honour in desiring to have one 
of the prints that have been made here of her countryman. 
I send what is said to be the best of five or six engraved 
by different hands, from different paintings. The verses at 
the bottom are truly extravagant. But you must know 
that the desire of pleasing by a perpetual rise of compliments in this polite nation, has so used up all the common 
expressions of approbation, that they are become flat and 
insipid, and to use them almost implies censure. Hence 
music, that formerly might be sufficiently praised when it 
was called bonne, to go a little farther they called it excellente, then superbe, magnifique, ezquise, celeste, all which, 
being in their turns worn out, there only remains divine ; 
and when that is grown as insignificant as its predecessors, 
I think they must return to common speech and common 
sense ; as from vying with one another in fine and costly 
paintings on their coaches, since I first knew the country, 
not being able to go farther in that way, they have returned 
lately to plain carriages, painted without arms or figures, in 
one uniform colour. 
</p><p>
The league of neutral nations to protect their commerce 
is now established. Holland, offended by fresh insults from 
England, is arming vigorously. That nation has madly 
brought itself into the greatest distress, and has not a friend 
in the world. 
</p><p>
With great and sincere esteem, 
I am, dear sir. 
Your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I received duly and in good order the several letters 
you have written to me of August 16th, 19th, September 
8th, and 22d. The papers that accompanied them of your 
writing gave me the pleasure of seeing the affairs of our 
country in such good hands, and the prospect, from your 
youth, of its having the service of so able a minister for a great number of years. But the little success that has 
attended your late applications for money mortified me 
exceedingly ; and the storm of bills which I found coming 
upon us both, has terrified and vexed me to such a degree 
that I have been deprived of sleep, and so much indisposed 
by continual anxiety, as to be rendered almost incapable of writing. 
</p><p>
At length I got over a reluctance that was almost invincible, and made another application to the government 
here for more money. I drew up and presented a state of 
debts and newly-expected demands, and requested its aid 
to extricate me. Judging from your letters that you were 
not likely to obtain any thing considerable from your court, 
I put down in my estimate the 25,000 dollars drawn upon 
you, with the same sum drawn upon me, as what would 
probably come to me for payment. I have now the pleasure to acquaint you that my memorial was received in the 
kindest and most friendly manner, and though the court 
here is not without its embarrassments on account of 
money, I was told to make myself easy, for that I should 
be assisted with what was necessary. Mr. Searle arriving 
about this time, and assuring me there had been a plentiful 
harvest, and great crops of all kinds ; that the Congress 
had demanded of the several States contributions in produce, which would be cheerfully given ; that they would 
therefore have plenty of provisions to dispose of; and I 
being much pleased with the generous behaviour just experienced, I presented another paper, proposing, in order 
to ease the government here, which had been so willing to 
ease us, that the Congress might furnish their army in 
America with provisions in part of payment for the services lent us. This proposition, I was told, was well 
taken ; but it being considered that the States having the 
enemy in their country, and obliged to make great expenses 
for the present campaign, the furnishing so much provisions 
as the French army might need, might straiten and be 
inconvenient to the Congress, his majesty did not at this 
time think it right to accept the offer. You will not 
wonder at my loving this good prince : he will win the 
hearts of all America. 
</p><p>
If you are not so fortunate in Spain, continue however 
the even good temper you have hitherto manifested. 
Spain owes us nothing ; therefore, whatever friendship she 
shows us in lending money or furnishing clothes, &c. 
though not equal to our wants and wishes, is however tant de gagne ; those who have begun to assist us, are more 
likely to continue than to decline, and we are still so much 
obliged as their aids amount to. But I hope and am confident, that court will be wiser than to take advantage of 
our distress, and insist on our making sacrifices by an 
agreement, which the circumstances of such distress would 
hereafter weaken, and the very proposition can only give 
disgust at present. Poor as we are, yet as I know wc 
shall be rich, I would rather agree with them to buy at a 
great price the whole of their right on the Mississippi, 
than sell a drop of its waters. A neighbour might as well 
ask me to sell my street door. 
</p><p>
I wish you could obtain an account of what they have 
supplied us with already in money and goods. 
</p><p>
Mr. Grand, informing me that one of the bills drawn on 
you having been sent from hence to Madrid, was come 
back unaccepted, I have directed him to pay it ; and he has, at my request, undertaken to write to the Marquis D'Yranda, to assist you with money to answer such bills 
as you are not otherwise enabled to pay, and to draw on 
him for the amount, which drafts I shall answer here as far 
as 25,000 dollars. If you expect more, acquaint me. But 
pray write to Congress as I do, to forbear this practice, 
which is so extremely hazardous, and may, some time or 
other, prove very mischievous to their credit and affairs. 
I have undertaken, too, for all the bills drawn on <a href='/results.php?tla=hel' rel='colleague'>Mr. Laurens</a>, that have yet appeared. He was to have sailed 
three days after Mr. Searle, that is, the 18th July. Mr. Searle begins to be in pain for him, having no good opinion 
of the little vessel he was to embark in. 
</p><p>
We have letters from America to the 7th August. The 
spirit of our people was never higher. Vast exertions 
making preparatory for some important action. Great 
harmony and affection between the troops of the two nations. The new money in good credit, &c. 
</p><p>
I will write to you again shortly, and to Mr. Carmichael. 
I shall now be able to pay up your salaries complete for the 
year ; but as demands unforeseen are continually coming 
upon me, I still retain the expectations you have given me 
of being reimbursed out of the first remittances you 
receive. 
</p><p>
If you find any inclination to hug me for the good news 
of this letter, I constitute and appoint Mrs. Jay my attorney, 
to receive in my behalf your embraces. With great and sincere esteem, 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, dear sir, 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have undertaken to pay all the bills of your acceptance 
that have come to my knowledge, and I hope in God no 
more will be drawn upon us, but when funds are first provided. In that case your constant residence at Madrid is 
no longer so necessary. You may make a journey either 
for health or pleasure, without retarding the progress of a 
negotiation not yet begun. Here you are greatly wanted, 
for messengers begin to come and go, and there is much 
talk of a treaty proposed, but I can neither make, nor agree 
to propositions of peace, without the assistance of my colleagues. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Adams</a>, I am afraid, cannot just now leave 
Holland. <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> is not in Europe, and <a href='/results.php?tla=hel' rel='colleague'>Mr. Laurens</a> 
is a prisoner, though abroad upon parol. I wish, therefore, 
that you would resolve upon the journey, and render yourself here as soon as possible. You would be of infinite 
service. Spain has taken four years to consider whether 
she should treat with us or not. Give her forty, and let us 
in the mean time mind our own business. I have much to 
communicate to you, but choose rather to do it viva voce, 
than trust it to letters. 
</p><p>
I am ever, my dear friend, 
</p><p>
Yours most affectionately, 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The Prince de Massaran being so good as to desire carrying a letter to you, I sit down to write you a few lines-. 
though I hope soon to see you. 
</p><p>
Enclosed I send a copy of one of <a href='/results.php?tla=sid' rel='colleague'>Mr. Deane's</a> letters ; 
I shall show you more when you come. 
</p><p>
In consequence of a proposition I sent over, the parliament of Britain have just passed an act for exchanging 
American prisoners. They have near 1100 in the jails of 
England and Ireland, all committed as charged with high 
treason. The act is to empower the king, notwithstanding 
such commitments, to consider them as prisoners of war, 
according to the law of nations, and exchange them as 
such. This seems to be giving up their pretensions of considering us as rebellious subjects, and is a kind of acknowledgment of our independence. Transports are now taking 
up to carry back to their country the poor, brave fellows. 
who have borne for years their cruel captivity, rather than 
serve our enemies, and an equal number of English are to 
be delivered in return. I have, upon desire, furnished passports for the vessels. 
</p><p>
Our affairs in Holland are en bon train ; we have some 
prospect of another loan there ; and all goes well here. 
</p><p>
The proposal to us of a separate peace with England, 
has been rejected in the manner you wish, and I am pretty 
certain they will now enter into a general treaty. I 
wrote you a few lines by last post, and on the same day a 
few more by the court courier. They were chiefly to press 
your coming hither to assist in the affair. 
</p><p>
With great and sincere esteem, 
I am ever, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and most humble servant,

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received a letter from a very respectable person 
in America, containing the following words, viz : — 
" It is confidently reported, propagated, and believed by 
some among us, that the Court of France was at bottom 
against our obtaining the fishery and territory, in that great 
extent in which both are secured to us by the treaty ; that 
our minister at that court favoured, or did not oppose, this 
design against us ; and that it was entirely owing to the 
firmness, sagacity, and disinterestedness of <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Adams</a>, 
with whom <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a> united, that we have obtained those 
important advantages." 
</p><p>
It is not my purpose to dispute any share of the honour 
of that treaty, which the friends of my colleagues may be 
disposed to give them ; but having now spent fifty years of 
my life in public offices and trusts, and having still one ambition left, that of carrying the character of fidelity, at least, 
to the grave with me, I cannot allow that I was behind any 
of them in zeal and faithfulness. I therefore think that I 
ought not to suffer an accusation, which falls little short of 
treason to my country, to pass without notice, when the 
means of effectual vindication arc at hand. You, sir, was 
a witness of my conduct in that allair. To you and my 
other colleagues I appeal, by sending to each a similar letter 
with this ; and I have no doubt of your readiness to do a 
brother-commissioner justice, by certificates that will entirely destroy the effect of that accusation. I have the 
honour to be, with much esteem, 
</p><p>
Sir, your most obedient, 
</p><p>
And most humble servant, 
</p><p>
