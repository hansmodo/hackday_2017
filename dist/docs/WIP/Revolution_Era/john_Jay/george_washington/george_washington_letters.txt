</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been a little surprised, that the several important 
pieces of intelligence lately received from Europe (such 
parts of it. I mean, as are circulated without reserve in conversation), have not been given to the public in a manner 
calculated to attract the attention and impress the minds of 
the people. As they are now propagated, they run through 
the country in a variety of forms, are confounded in the 
common mass of general rumours, and lose a real part of 
their effect. It would certainly be attended with many 
valuable consequences if they could be given to the people 
in some more authentic and pointed manner. It would 
assist the measures taken to restore our currency, promote 
the recruiting of the army and our other military arrangements, and give a certain spring to our affairs in general. 
</p><p>
Congress may have particular reasons for not communicating the intelligence officially (which would certainly be 
the best mode if it could be done), but if it cannot, it were 
to be wished that as much as is intended to be commonly 
known could be published in as striking a way, and with as 
great an appearance of authority as may be consistent with 
propriety. 
</p><p>
I have taken the liberty to trouble you with this hint, as 
sometimes things the most obvious escape attention. If 
you agree with me in sentiment, you will easily fall upon 
the most proper mode for answering the purpose. 
With great esteem and regard, I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant,

</p><p>
I have received your several favours of the 2d, 3d, and 
28th of March, and 6th of April. I thank you for them all, 
but especially for the last, which I consider as a distinguishing mark of your confidence and friendship. 
</p><p>
Conscious that it is the aim of my actions to promote the 
public good, and that no part of my conduct is influenced by 
personal enmity to individuals, I cannot be insensible to the 
artifice employed by some men to prejudice me in the 
public esteem. The circumstance of which you have 
obliged me with a communication, is among a number of 
other instances of the unfriendly views which have governed a certain gentleman from a very early period. Some 
of these have been too notorious not to have come to your 
knowledge ; others, from the manner in which they have 
been conveyed to me, will probably never be known, except to a very few. But you have perhaps heard enough 
yourself to make any further explanation from me unnecessary. 
</p><p>
The desire, however, which it is natural I should feel to 
preserve the good opinion of men of sense and virtue, conspiring with my wish to cultivate your friendship in particular, induces me to trouble you with a statement of some 
facts which will serve to place the present attack in its 
proper light. In doing this I shall recapitulate and bring 
into view a series of transactions, many of which have been 
known to you ; but some of which may possibly have 
escaped your memory. 
</p><p>
An opinion prevailing that the enemy were likely, shortly, 
to evacuate these States, I was naturally led to turn my 
thoughts to a plan of operations against Canada, in case that 
event should take place. A winter campaign, before the 
enemy could have an opportunity of reinforcing and putting 
themselves in a more perfect state of defence, appeared to 
promise the most speedy and certain success, and the route 
by Co-os offered itself as most direct and practicable. In 
this I fully agreed with <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> and some other gentlemen whom I consulted on the occasion; and on the 12th 
of September last I wrote to Congress accordingly, submitting it to them, whether it would not be advisable to be 
laying up magazines, opening a road, and making other 
preparations for the undertaking. They approved the project, and authorized me to carry it into execution. I the 
more readily entered into it from a consideration, that if 
circumstances should not permit us to carry on the enterprise, preparations towards it could easily be converted into 
another channel, and made serviceable to our operations 
elsewhere without any material addition of expense to the 
continent, because provisions, which would compose the 
principal part of the expense, were at all events to be purchased on Connecticut River, the only doubt being whether 
they should, be used in an expedition against Canada, or 
transported to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> — circumstances to determine this: 
with truth it may be added, that, excepting the articles of 
provision and forage, which, as before observed, would 
have been bought if no expedition by the way of Co-os 
had been in contemplation, the " incredible expense," 
mentioned by <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> in his letter of March 4th, 
amounted to the purchase of a few pair of men's shoes, 
and some leather for moccasins only. If any other expense 
has been incurred, it is unknown to me — must have been 
by his order, and he alone answerable for it. 
</p><p>
In October following, Congress entered into arrangements with the Marquis de la Fayette for co-operating with 
the court of France, in an expedition against that country. 
In this scheme, one body of troops was to proceed from 
Co-os and penetrate by way of the river St. Francis ; others 
forming a junction at Niagara, were to enter Canada by 
that route ; and while these were operating in this manner, 
a French fleet and a body of French troops were to go up 
the river St. Lawrence, and take possession of <a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a>. 
</p><p>
You are well acquainted with the opposition I gave to 
this plan, and my reasons at large for it. From what has 
since happened, they seem to have met the full approbation 
of Congress. The ideas I held up were principally these : 
that we ought not to enter into any contract with a foreign 
power, unless we were sure we should be able to fulfil our 
engagements — that it was uncertain whether the enemy 
would quit the States or not ; and in case they did not, it 
would be impracticable to furnish the aids which we had 
stipulated — that even if they should leave us, it was doubtful whether our own resources would be equal to the supplies required ; that therefore it would be impolitic to 
hazard a contract of the kind, and better to remain at 
liberty to act as future conjunctures should point out. I 
recommended, nevertheless, as there were powerful reasons 
to hope the enemy might go away, that eventual preparations should be made to take advantage of it, to possess 
ourselves of Niagara and other posts in that quarter, for the 
security of our frontiers, and to carry our views still 
further with respect to a conquest of Canada, if we should 
find ourselves able to prosecute such an enterprise. 
</p><p>
This, Congress in a subsequent resolve, approved, and 
directed to be done. It was not the least motive with me 
for recommending it, that operations of this nature seemed 
to be a very favourable object with this honourable body. 
The preparations on Hudson River were undertaken in 
consequence. 
</p><p>
Upon a nearer view of our finances and resources, and 
when it came to be decided that the enemy would continue 
for some time longer to hold the posts they were in possession of, in the course of the conferences with which I was 
honoured by the committee of Congress in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I 
suggested my doubts of the propriety of continuing our 
northern preparations upon so extensive a plan as was first 
determined. The committee were of opinion with me, that 
the state of our currency and supplies in general would 
oblige us to act on the defensive next campaign, except so 
far as related to an expedition into the Indian country for 
chastising the savages, and preventing their depredations 
on our back settlements ; and that though it would be extremely desirable to be prepared for pushing our operations 
further, yet our necessities exacting a system of economy 
forbade our launching into much extra expense for objects 
which were remote and contingent. This determination 
having taken place, all the northern preparations were discontinued, except such as were necessary towards the 
intended Indian expedition. 
</p><p>
Things were in this situation when I received a letter 
from General Bailey (living at Co-os), expressing some fears 
for the safety of the magazine at Co-os ; in consequence of 
which I directed the stores to be removed lower down the 
country. This I did to prevent a possibility of accident, 
though I did not apprehend they were in much danger. 
Sometime afterward I received the letter (No. 1) from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, expressing similar fears, to which I returned 
him the answer of 14th February, transmitted by him to 
Congress, (No. 2.) Knowing that preparations had been 
making at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, and unacquainted with their true design, 
he inferred, from a vague expression in that letter, that the 
intention of attacking Canada was still adhered to, but that I 
had changed the plan, and was going by way of Lake Champlain or Ontario : either of these routes he pronounces impracticable, and represents that by Co-os as the only practicable one. He goes further, and declares, that " in the 
present state of our army, and the actual situation of our 
magazines, to attempt a serious invasion of Canada by 
whatever route, would prove unsuccessful, unless the fleet 
of our allies should at the same time co-operate with us, by 
sailing up the river St. Lawrenre." Though I differ with 
him as to the impracticability of both the other routes, I 
venture to go a step beyond him respecting our ability to 
invade Canada ; and am convinced, that in our present 
circumstances, and with the enemy in front, we cannot 
undertake a serious invasion of that country at all, even 
with the aid of an allied Fleet. 
</p><p>
You will perceive, sir, that I have uniformly made the 
departure of the enemy from these States an essential condition to the invasion of Canada, and that <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> 
has entirely mistaken my intentions. Hoping that I had 
embarked in a scheme which our situation would not justify, 
he eagerly seizes the opportunity of exposing my supposed 
errors to Congress ; and in the excess of his intemperate 
zeal to injure me, exhibits himself in a point of view from 
which I imagine he will derive little credit. The decency 
of the terms in which he undertakes to arraign my conduct, 
both to myself and to Congress, and the propriety of the 
hasty appeal he has made, will, I believe, appear at least 
questionable to every man of sense and delicacy. 
</p><p>
The last paragraph of the extract with which you favour 
me, is a pretty remarkable one. I shall make no comments 
further than as it implies a charge of neglect on my part, in 
not writing to him but once since December. From the 
beginning of last campaign to the middle of December, about 
seven months, I have copies of near fifty letters to him, and 
about forty originals from him. I think it will be acknowledged the correspondence was frequent enough during that 
period ; and if it has not continued in the same proportion 
since, the only >reason was, that the season of the year, the 
troops being in winter-quarters, and <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>'s situation unfruitful of events, and unproductive of any military 
arrangements between us, afforded very little matter for 
epistolary intercourse ; and I flatter myself it will be readily 
believed, that I am sufficiently occupied with the necessary 
business of my station, and have no need of increasing it 
by multiplying letters without an object. If you were to 
peruse, my dear sir, the letters that have passed between 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> and myself for a lone time back, you would 
be sensible that I have no great temptation to court his 
correspondence, when the transacting of business does not 
require it. An air of design — a want of candour in many 
instances, and even of politeness, give no very inviting 
complexion to the correspondence on his part. As a specimen of this, I send you a few letters and extracts, which at 
your leisure, I shall be glad you will cast your eye upon. 
</p><p>
Last fall it was for some time strongly suspected that the 
enemy would transport the whole, or the greater part, of 
their force eastward, and combine one great land and sea 
operation against the French fleet in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> harbour : on 
this supposition, as I should go in person to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, the 
command next in importance was the posts on the North 
River. This properly would devolve on <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> ; 
but from motives of peculiar scrupulousness, as there had 
been a difference between us, I thought it best to know 
whether it was agreeable to him, before I directed his continuance. By way of compliment, I wrote him a letter 
containing the extract No. 3, expecting a cordial answer 
and cheerful acceptance. I received the evasive and unsatisfactory reply, No. 4. A few days after this, upon 
another occasion, I wrote him the letter No. 5, to which I 
received the extraordinary answer No. 6, which was passed 
over in silence. 
</p><p>
The plan of operations for the campaign being determined, a commanding officer was to be appointed for the 
Indian expedition. This command, according to all present 
appearance, will probably be of the second, if not of the first 
importance for the campaign. The officer conducting it 
has a flattering prospect of acquiring more credit than can 
be expected by any other this year, and he has the best 
reason to hope for success. General Lee, from his situation, 
was out of the question. <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, who, by the 
way, would have been most agreeable to me, was so uncertain of continuing in the army, that I could not appoint 
him. <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a> I need not mention. I therefore 
made the offer of it (for the appointment could no longer be 
delayed) to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, who was next in seniority, 
though perhaps I might have avoided it, if I had been so 
disposed, from his being in a command by the special appointment of Congress. My letter to him on the occasion 
you will find in No. 7. I believe you will think it was 
conceived in very candid and polite terms, and merited a 
rent answer from the one given it in No. 8. 
</p><p>
I discovered, very early in the war, symptoms of coldness 
and constraint in <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>'s behaviour to me. These 
increased as he rose into greater consequence; but we did 
not come to a direct breach till the beginning of last year. This was occasioned by a correspondence, which I thought 
made rather free with me, between him and General Conway, which accidentally came to my knowledge. The 
particulars of this affair you will find delineated in the 
packet herewith, endorsed " Papers respecting General 
Conway." Besides the evidence contained in them of the 
genuineness of the offensive correspondence, I have other 
proofs, still more convincing, which, having been given me 
in a confidential way, I am not at liberty to impart. 
</p><p>
After this affair subsided, I made it a point of treating 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> with all the attention and cordiality in my 
power, as well from a sincere desire of harmony, as from 
an unwillingness to give any cause of triumph to our enemies from an appearance of dissension among ourselves. 
I can appeal to the world and to the whole army, whether 
I have not cautiously avoided every word or hint that could tend to dismay <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> in any way. I am sorry his conduct to me has not been equally generous, and that 
he is continually giving me fresh proof's of malevolence and 
> i . It will not be doing him injustice to say, that besides the little underhand intrigues which he is frequently 
practising, there has hardly been any great military question in which his advice has been asked, that it has not been 
given in an equivocal and designing manner, apparently calculated to afford him an opportunity of censuring me, on the failure of whatever measures might be adopted. 
</p><p>
When I find that this gentleman does not scruple to take 
the most unfair advantages of me, I am under a necessity 
of explaining his conduct to justify my own. This, and the 
perfect confidence I have in you, have occasioned me to 
trouble you with so free a communication of the state of 
things between us. I shall still be as passive as a regard 
to my own character will permit. I am, however, uneasy, as 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> has endeavoured to impress Congress with 
an unfavourable idea of me, and as I only know this in a 
private confidential way, that I cannot take any step to 
remove the impression if it should be made. I am aware, 
sir, of the delicacy of your situation, and I mean this letter 
only for your own private information ; you will therefore 
not allow yourself to be embarrassed by its contents, but 
with respect to me, pass it over in silence. 
</p><p>

</p><p>

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In one of your former letters you intimate, that a free 
communication of sentiments will not be displeasing to you. 
If, under this sanction, I should step beyond the line you would wish to draw, and suggest ideas or ask questions 
which are improper to be answered, you hare only to pass them by in silence. I wish you to be convinced that I do 
not desire to pry into measures the knowledge of which is not necessary for my government as an executive officer, or the premature discovery of which might be prejudicial to plans in contemplation. 
</p><p>
After premising this. I beg leave to ask what are the 
reasons for keeping the continental frigates in port? If it 
is because hands cannot be obtained to man them on 
the present encouragement, some other plan ought to be 
adopted to make them useful. Had not Congress better 
lend them to commanders of known bravery and capacity 
for a limited term, at the expiration of which the vessels, if 
not taken or lost, to revert to the States— they and their 
crews, in the mean time, enjoying the exclusive benefit of 
all captures they make, but acting either .singly or conjointly under the direction of Congress ? If this or a similar 
plan could be fallen upon, comprehending the whole number, under some common head, a man of ability and 
authority commissioned to act as commodore or admiral, 
I think great advantages might result from it. I am not 
sure but at this moment, by such a collection of the naval 
force we have, all the British armed vessels and transports 
at Georgia might be taken or destroyed, and their troops 
ruined. Upon the present system, our ships are not only 
very expensive and totally useless in port, but sometimes 
require a land force to protect them, as happened lately at 
New-London. 
</p><p>
The rumour of the camp is, that Monsieur Gerard is about 
to return to France ; some speak confidently of its taking 
place. If this be a fact, the motives doubtless an > powerful ; 
as it would open a wide field for speculation, and give our 
enemies, whether with or without real cause, at least a 
handle for misrepresentation and triumph. 
</p><p>
Will Congress suffer the Bermudian vessels, which are to have arrived at Delaware and Chesapeake Bays, to 
exchange their salt for Hour, as is reported to be their intention ? Will they not .rather order them to depart immediately? Indulging them with a supply of provisions at 
this time will be injurious to us in two respects: it will deprive us of what we really stand in need of for ourselves, 
and will contribute to the support of that swarm of privateers which resort to Bermuda, from whence they infest our coast, and, in a manner, annihilate our trade. Besides these 
considerations, by withholding a supply, we throw many 
additional months upon the enemy's magazines, and increase proportionally their distress. They will not and cannot let their people starve. 
</p><p>
In the last place, though first in importance, I shall ask, is there any thing doing, or that can be done, to restore the 
credit of our currency '. The depreciation of it is got to so alarming a point that a wagon-load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon-load of provisions. 
</p><p>
I repeat what I before 'ved, that I do not wish for 
</p><p>
your reply to more of these matters than you can touch with strict propriety. 
</p><p>
Very truly I am, dear sir,

I seize a moment of leisure to thank you, my dear sir, 
for your obliging favours of the 21st and 26th of April. 
My friendship for you will always make me take pleasure 
in cultivating the esteem and confidence of which you so 
politely assure me. 
</p><p>
You give an affecting summary of the causes of the 
national evils we feel, and the still greater we have reason 
to apprehend. To me it appears that our affairs are in a 
very delicate situation ; and what is not the least to be 
lamented is, that many people think they are in a very 
flourishing way ; and seem in a great measure insensible to 
the danger with which we are threatened. If Britain should 
be able to make a vigorous campaign in America this 
summer, in the present depreciation of our money, scantiness of supplies, want of virtue and want of exertion, 'tis 
hard to say what may be the consequence. 
</p><p>
It is a melancholy consideration that any concerned in 
the conduct of public affairs should discover an indifference 
to the state of our currency. Nothing, in my opinion, can 
be more manifest, than that if something effectual be not 
done to restore its credit, it will in a short time either cease 
to circulate altogether, or circulate so feebly as to be utterly 
incapable of drawing out the resources of the country. 
This is nearly the case now.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Not having received from your excellency, during the 
last winter or summer, the acknowledgment of any letter, 
except of my public despatches of October last, I apprehend that some private letters, which I have had the pleasure of addressing to you since that time, have miscarried. 
I resume my pen, therefore, to repeat the thanks which 
were contained in one of them, for the wine you had the 
goodness to present me with ; and to assure you that I entertain the friendly sentiments towards you which I have 
ever experienced since our first acquaintance. 
</p><p>
We have now passed another campaign, and no very 
important occurrence has intervened on this side the Atlantic. The evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> was considered by 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>, in his last letters to me, as an event that 
would certainly take place ; and from other circumstances 
I am induced to believe it is effected by this time. Part of 
the garrison (the British troops) will probably go to the West Indies, and the Germans to the northward. Admiral Pigot is now in New- York harbour, with twenty-six heavy 
ships, ready wooded and watered for sea ; but the present circumstances, though somewhat equivocal, do not indicate 
that New-York will be abandoned this year ; notwithstanding there have been many reports and conjectures of the kind some weeks ago. 
</p><p>
The Marquis De Vaudruille is in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> harbour with 
twelve sail of the line (three excepted, which are at 
<a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>), having unfortunately stranded and lost the 
Magnifique on entering that bay. But Congress have presented to his most Christian Majesty the ship America, of 
74 guns, built at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, and now nearly fit for sea. 
</p><p>
The changes in the British ministry, and the fluctuation 
of their councils, are the subjects of universal speculation, 
We wait with impatience to hear the result of the negotiations, and not being very sanguine in our expectations, 
endeavour to hold ourselves prepared for every contingency. I am certain it will afford you pleasure to know 
that our army is better organized, disciplined, and clothed, 
than it has been at any period since the commencement of 
the war. This you may be assured is the fact. 
</p><p>
I shall always be happy to hear from you, especially at 
the present important crisis of European politics ; and beg 
you will be persuaded, that with the warmest wishes and 
most respectful compliments to Mrs. Jay, I am, with sentiments of the highest regard and esteem,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Mr. Taylor presented me the honour of your favour of the 25th ult., and gave me the pleasure of hearing that 
Mrs. Jay and yourself were well when he left New- York. Upon your safe return to your native country, after a 
long absence, and the important services you have rendered it in many interesting negotiations, I very sincerely congratulate you and your lady. 
</p><p>
It gave me great pleasure to hear of your appointment as secretary of the United States for the department of 
foreign affairs ; a happier choice in my opinion could not have been made, and I shall always rejoice at any circumstance that will contribute either to your honour, interest, or convenience. 
</p><p>
It will always give me pleasure to hear from you. Mrs. Washington joins me in respectful compliments to, and best wishes for Mrs. Jay and yourself. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The letters which you did me the favour of writing to 
me on the 17th and 23d of last month from <a href='/results.php?city=poughkeepsie' rel='city'>Poughkeepsie</a>, 
came duly to hand, and claim my particular acknowledgments. 
</p><p>
With peculiar pleasure I now congratulate you on the 
success of your labours to obtain an unconditional ratification of the proposed constitution in the Convention of your 
State, the account of which was brought to us by the mail 
of yesterday. 
</p><p>
Although I could hardly conceive it possible, after ten 
States had adopted the constitution, that New- York, separated as it is from the remaining three, and so peculiarly 
divided in sentiments as it is, would withdraw herself from 
the union, yet considering the great majority which appeared 
to cling together in the < Convention, and the decided temper 
of the leaders in the opposition, I did not, I confess, see the 
means by which it was to be avoided. 
</p><p>
The exertion of those who were able to effect this great 
work, must have been equally arduous and meritorious. It 
is to be hoped that the State of North Carolina will not 
spend much time in deciding on this question, and as to 
Rhode Island, its conduct hitherto has so far baffled all 
calculation, that few are disposed to hazard a conjecture 
thereon. 
</p><p>
With sentiments of the sincerest esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and affectionate servant,

My hear Sir, 
</p><p>
The indisposition, and consequent absence from Mount 
Vernon, of my nephew, Major Washington, to whom the 
care of my private business is intrusted, makes it indispensably necessary for me to go home before the meeting 
of Congress. 
</p><p>
My stay there will be longer or shorter, according to circumstances ; but it cannot exceed the middle of October, as 
I must be back before the meeting of that body. 
</p><p>
Will you permit me, my dear sir, to make a similar 
request to the one I did last year, and to pray that your 
ideas may not be confined to matters merely judicial, but 
extended to all other topics which have, or may occur to 
you, as fit subjects for general or private communications. 
With sincere esteem and affectionate regard, 
I am, my dear sir, 
Your obedient and very humble servant,

</p><p>
My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 23d of June, from London, and duplicate, have both been received ; and your safe arrival, after 
so short a passage, gave sincere pleasure as well on private 
as on public account, to all your friends in this country, and 
to none in a greater degree, I can venture to assure you, 
than it did to myself. 
</p><p>
As you will receive letters from the secretary of state's 
office, giving an official account of public occurrences as 
they have arisen and progressed, it is unnecessary for me 
to retouch any of them; and yet I cannot restrain myself 
from making some observations on the most recent of them, 
the communication of which was received this morning 
only. I mean the protest of the governor of Upper Canada 
(delivered by Lieut. Sheaffe), against our occupying lands 
far from any of the posts, which, long ago, they ought to 
have surrendered, and far within the known, and until now, 
the acknowledged limits of the United States. 
</p><p>
On this irregular and high-handed proceeding of Mr. Simcoe, which is no longer masked, I would rather hear 
what the ministry of Great Britain will say, than pronounce 
my own sentiments thereon. But can that government, or 
will it attempt, after this official act of one of their governors, 
to hold out ideas of friendly intentions towards the United 
States, and suffer such conduct to pass with impunity? 
</p><p>
This may be considered as the most open and daring act 
of the British agents in America, though it is not the most 
hostile or cruel ; for there does not remain a doubt, in the 
mind of any well-informed person in this country (not shut 
against conviction), that all the difficulties we encounter 
with the Indians, their hostilities, the murders of helpless 
women and innocent children along our frontiers, result 
from the conduct of the agents of Great Britain in this 
country. In vain is it, then, for its administration, in Britain, 
to disavow having given orders which will warrant such 
conduct, while their agents go unpunished, while we have 
a thousand corroborating circumstances, and indeed almost 
as many evidences (some of which cannot be brought forward), to prove that they are seducing from our alliances 
(endeavouring to remove them over the line) tribes that 
have hitherto been kept in peace and friendship with us, at 
a heavy expense, and who have no cause of complaint, except 
pretended ones of their own creating ; while they keep in a 
state of irritation the tribes who are hostile to us, and instigating those who know little of us, or we of them, to unite 
in the war against us ; and while it is an undeniable fact that 
they are furnishing the whole with arms, ammunition, 
clothing, and even provisions to carry on the war, I might 
go further and, if they arc not much belied, add men also, 
in disguise. 
</p><p>
Can it be expected, I ask, so long as these things are 
known in the United States, or at least firmly believed, 
and suffered with impunity by Great Britain, that there ever 
will, or can be any cordiality between the two countries? 
I answer no : and I will undertake, without the gift of prophecy, to predict, that it will be impossible to keep this 
country in a state of amity with Great Britain long, if the 
posts are not surrendered. A knowledge of these being 
my sentiments would have little weight, I am persuaded, 
with the British administration, nor, perhaps, with the nation, 
in effecting the measure ; but both may rest satisfied that, 
if they want to be in peace with this country, and want to 
enjoy the benefits of its trade, &c, this is the road to it — 
withholding them, and the consequences we feel at present 
continuing, war inevitably. 
</p><p>
This letter is written to you in extreme haste, while the 
papers respecting this subject are copying at the secretary 
of state's office, to go by express to New- York, for a vessel 
which we have just heard sails to-morrow ; you will readily 
perceive, therefore, I had no time for digesting, and as little 
for correcting it. I shall only add that you may be assured 
always of the sincere friendship and affection of 
</p><p>

My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On Tuesday last, I returned from my tour to the westward. On Monday, Congress by adjournment are to meet; 
and on the day following, Mr. Bayard, according to his 
present expectation, is to leave this city for London. 
Thus circumstanced (having so little time between my 
return and the opening of the session, to examine papers, 
and to prepare my communications for the Legislature), 
you will readily perceive that my present address to you 
must be hurried ; at the same time, my friendship and regard for you would not let an opportunity so good as the 
one afforded by Mr. Bayard, pass without some testimony 
of my remembrance, and an acknowledgment of the receipt of your private letters to me, dated the 23d of June, 
21st of July, and 5th and 11th of August. These comprehend all the letters I have received from you since your 
arrival in England to the present date. 
</p><p>
That of the 5th of August dawns more favourably upon 
the success of your mission than any that had preceded it, 
and for the honour, dignity, and interest of this country; 
for your own reputation and glory ; and for the peculiar 
satisfaction I should derive from it, as well on private as 
on public considerations, no man more ardently wishes you 
complete success than I do. But, as you have observed in 
some of your letters, that it is hardly possible in the early 
stages of a negotiation to foresee all the results, so much 
depending upon fortuitous circumstances, and incidents 
which are not within our control, — so to deserve success, by 
employing the means with which we are possessed to the 
best advantage, and trusting the event to the all-wise Disposer, is all that an enlightened public, and the virtuous 
and well-disposed part of the community can reasonably 
expect ; nor in this, will they, I am sure, be disappointed. 
Against the malignancy of the discontented, the turbulent, 
and the vicious, no abilities, no exertions, nor the most unshaken integrity are any safeguard. 
</p><p>
As far as depends upon the executive, measures preparatory for the worst, while it hopes for the best, will be pursued; and I shall endeavour to keep things in statu quo, 
until your negotiation assumes a more decisive form, which 
I hope will soon be the case, as there are many hot heads and impetuous spirits among us, who with difficulty can be 
kept within bounds. This, however, ought not to precipitate your conduct ; for, as it has been observed, " there is a 
tide in human affairs," which ought to be watched; and because I believe all who are acquainted with you will 
readily concede, that considerations both public and private combine to urge you to bring your mission to a close, with as much celerity as the nature of it will admit. 
</p><p>
As you have been, and will continue to be fully informed 
by the secretary of state of all transactions of a public 
nature, which relate to or may have an influence on the 
points of your mission, it would be unnecessary for me to 
touch upon any of them in this letter, was it not for the 
presumption that the insurrection in the western counties of 
this State has excited much speculation, and a variety of 
opinions abroad ; and will be represented differently according to the wishes of some, and the prejudices of others, 
who may exhibit it as an evidence of what has been predicted, "that we are unable to govern ourselves." Under 
this view of the subject, I am happy in giving it to you as 
the general opinion, that this event having happened at the 
time it did was fortunate, although it will be attended with 
considerable expense. 
</p><p>
That the self-created societies which have spread themselves over this country, have been labouring incessantly to 
sow the seeds of distrust, jealousy, and of course discontent, thereby hoping to effect some revolution in the government, is not unknown to you. That they have been the 
fomenters of the western disturbances, admits of no doubt in 
the mind of any one who will examine their conduct ; but, 
fortunately, they precipitated a crisis for which they were 
not prepared ; and thereby have unfolded views which will , 
I trust, effectuate their annihilation sooner than it might 
otherwise have happened ; at the same time, that it has 
afforded an occasion for the people of this country to show 
their abhorrence of the result, and their attachment to the 
constitution and the laws : for I believe that five times the 
number of militia that was required would have come forward, if it had been necessary, in support of them. 
</p><p>
The spirit which blazed out on this occasion, as soon as 
the object was fully understood, and the lenient measures 
of the government were made known to the people, deserve to be communicated ; for there are instances of general officers going at the head of a single troop and light 
companies ; of field officers, when they came to the places 
of rendezvous and found no command for them in that 
grade, turning into the ranks and proceeding as private 
soldiers under their own captains ; and of numbers, possessing the first fortunes in the country, standing in the 
ranks as private men, and marching day by day, with their 
knapsacks and haversacks at their backs ; sleeping on 
straw with a single blanket in a soldier's tent, during the 
frosty nights we have had, by way of example to others. 
Nay, more, of many young Quakers (not discouraged by 
the elders) of the first characters, families, and properties, 
having turned into the ranks, and marching with the troops. 
</p><p>
These things have terrified the insurgents, who had no 
conception that such a spirit prevailed ; but while the thunder only rumbled at a distance, were boasting of their 
strength, and wishing for and threatening the militia by 
turns ; intimating, that the arms they should take from them 
would soon become a magazine in their hands. Their language is much changed indeed, but their principles want 
correction. 
</p><p>
I shall be more prolix, in my speech to Congress, on the 
commencement and progress of this insurrection, than is 
usual in such an instrument, or than I should have been on 
any other occasion ; but as numbers (at home and abroad) 
will hear of the insurrection, and will read the speech, that 
may know nothing of the documents to which it might refer, 
I conceived it would be better to encounter the charge of 
prolixity, by giving a cursory detail of facts (that would 
show the prominent features of the thing), than to let it go 
naked into the world, to be dressed up according to the 
fancy or inclination of the readers, or the policy of our 
enemies. 
</p><p>
I write nothing in answer to the letter of Mr. Wangenheim (enclosed by you to me). Were I to enter into correspondences of that sort (admitting there was no impropriety in the measure), I should be unable to attend to my 
ordinary duties. I have established it as a maxim, neither 
to invite nor to discourage emigrants. My opinion is, that 
they will come hither as fast as the true interest and policy 
of the United States will be benefited by foreign population. I believe many of these, as Mr. Wangenheim relates, 
have been, and I fear will continue to be, imposed upon by 
speculators in land and other things. But I know of no 
prevention but caution, nor any remedy except the laws. 
AT or is military, or other employment, so easy to obtain as 
foreigners conceive, in a country where offices and the 
seekers of them bear no proportion to each other. 
With sincere esteem and great regard, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your affectionate servant,

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since writing to you, by Mr. Bayard, about the first of 
November, I have been favoured with your letters of the 
13th September and 2d of October. 
As the sentiments contained in the first of these, respecting the communications of <a href='/results.php?tla=jam' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Monroe</a> to the National 
Convention of France, were also transmitted in a private 
letter from you to the secretary of state, and replied to by 
him (both of which I have seen), I shall dwell no longer on 
that subject, than just to observe, 1st, that considering the 
place in which they were delivered, and the neutral policy 
this country had resolved to pursue, it was a measure that 
does not appear to have been well devised by our minister : 
2dly, aware of this himself, and that his conduct would be 
criticised, he has assigned reasons for its adoption ; a summary of which is, that the navy officers and privateersmen of France, who had resorted to our ports and had been 
laid under such restrictions as neutral policy required from 
us, although disagreeable to them, had represented this 
country (and not without effect) as unfriendly to the French 
revolution; to do away which he found himself necessitated 
to counteract them, by strong assurances of the good dispositions of the people of these United States towards that 
nation : and 3dly, although I think with you that in order 
to accomplish this he has stepped beyond the true line, yet, 
under the then existing circumstances, the expression of 
such reciprocal good will was susceptible of two views, one 
of which, even in the pending state of the negotiation (by 
alarming as well as offending the British ministry), might 
have no unfavourable operation in bringing matters to a 
happy and speedy result, than which nothing is more desirable, or can be more ardently wished for by the friends of 
peace and good order in this country. 
</p><p>
As the secretary of state has written to you several 
times since the receipt of your statement of the negotiation 
on the 13th of September, I shall add nothing to the observations which are contained in his letters on the subject 
thereof. 
</p><p>
The business of the session, hitherto, has been tranquil ; 
and I perceive nothing at this time to make it otherwise, 
unless the result of the negotiation (which is anxiously expected by all) should produce divisions. As yet, no details 
have been handed to Congress on this subject ; indeed, no 
communication of that business has been made to anybody, 
except those immediately about me in the executive departments. 
</p><p>
The Virginia escheats of British property do not, as I 
am informed, stand upon the ground as related to you ; but 
as I am not accurately enough read in the law respecting 
these escheats to be precise in my recital of it, I will request the secretary of state to give you the principles 
thereof. 
</p><p>
As I expected, and as you have been informed the result 
would probably be, so it has happened, that the western 
insurrection has terminated highly honourable for this country ; which, by the energy of its laws, and the good dispositions of its citizens, has brought the rioters to a perfect sense of their duty, without shedding a drop of blood. 
In the eyes of foreigners among us, this affair stands in a 
high point of respectability. With great truth, I remain, 
</p><p>

My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You will have learned from the public gazettes, and 
through other more authentic channels, that all that rested 
with me to do, to give ratification to the treaty between 
this country and Great Britain, is already accomplished. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=top' rel='colleague'>Mr. Pinckney's</a> absence from the court of London, the information and aids it was expected he would derive from 
Mr. Short's presence at that of Madrid, the pecuniary situation of our affairs in Holland requiring the attention of <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Adams</a> in that country, and the little knowledge we had of 
the character and qualifications of Mr. Deas, have occasioned no little embarrassment in this business. However, a mode is adopted which, I hope, will be effectual. 
</p><p>
It has not been among the smallest of these embarrassments that the domineering spirit of Great Britain should 
revive just at this crisis, and the outrageous and insulting conduct of some of her officers should combine therewith, to 
play into the hands of the discontented, and sour the minds of those who are friends to peace, order, and friendship with all the world. But this by-the-bye. 
</p><p>
The object of this letter is to pray you to aid me with hints relative to those points which you conceive to be lit 
subjects for the further friendly negotiations on the West India trade with Great Britain, agreeably to the recommendation of the Senate ; and which appear to have been 
in contemplation by the concluding part of the treaty signed by yourself and <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel=''>Lord Grenville</a>. 
</p><p>
I intended to have asked this favour of you at an earlier day ; but a coincidence of unexpected circumstances has 
involved me in so much business and perplexity, that it has been delayed from time to time (since my arrival in this 
city) until the present moment. But as nothing is now asked that you have not, I am sure, revolved over and 
over again during your negotiation, and since the decision of the Senate thereon, T persuade myself it will require but 
little time for the digest I ask ; and which I beg to receive as soon as you can make it convenient to give me, circumstances rendering it necessary for me to leave this place, if 
possible, on Monday next, for Virginia, in order to bring back my family ; but instructions for the new negotiator must be prepared before I go. 
</p><p>
With great esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
I remain, my dear sir, 
Your affectionate and obedient servant,

My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your two letters of the 14th instant came duly to hand. With respect to Mr. *******, I beg you to be persuaded, 
that if all things in his favour are equal, your mentioning of him will have its weight. But in appointments of the sort 
he solicits, many matters must be attended to ; and as I am sure we have the same wishes respecting them, namely, to 
fix on characters who, under all circumstances, are most likely to answer the objects of their appointment, and to 
meet general approbation, I must endeavour to be circumspect in the selection ; and that I may have the greater 
variety to choose from, I would thank you and my other friends for giving me the names of such gentlemen as may 
occur, and are most prominent and fit to discharge the duties of commissioners. 
</p><p>
My information with respect to the general disposition of the people, accords with yours; and I have little doubt 
of a perfect amelioration of sentiment, alter the present fermentation (which is not only subsiding, but changing) has 
evaporated a little more. The dregs, however, will always remain, and the slightest motion will stir them up. With sincere esteem, and affectionate attachment,

I am always yours,

Accept, my dear sir, my thanks for your note of the 25th 
hist., enclosing a copy of 3Ir. Bayard's letter to you. The 
purport of it is pleasing ; but the conduct of the British 
armed vessels in the West Indies is intolerable beyond all 
forbearance.

My answer, given yesterday to the House of Representatives' request for papers, will, I expect, set a host of scribblers to work: but I shall proceed steadily on in all the 
measures which depend on the executive, to carry the 
British treaty into effect.
