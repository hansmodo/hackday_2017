My dear Jay, 
</p><p>
I expected long ere this to have been seated quietly at 
home ; but the progress which the enemy had made, and 
seemed likely to make, into your country, induced me to 
suspend my resolution which I came to several months ago, 
and assist with the whole of my power (little enough, God 
knows) a State which appeared to be marked for destruction. The storm, however, has passed away ; and though I 
have reason to dread its bursting upon the heads of my 
countrymen, I cannot but most sincerely congratulate you 
upon the event. I wish you may improve the time ; and if 
you can concur with me in sentiment, it will be improved 
in the following manner. Let Schuyler, whose reputation 
has been deeply wounded by the malevolence of party spirit, 
immediately repair to Congress, and after establishing himself in the good opinion of his countrymen, by a fair and 
open inquiry into his conduct, concert with the House such 
a plan as he shall think will effectually secure all the upper 
country against the attacks of the enemy ; which plan being 
agreed to by the House, give him full power to effect it, 
and send him off with all possible despatch to carry it into 
execution. Let steps be taken to place real obstructions in 
the North River, at least in that part of it which can be commanded by Fort Montgomery, and the other fort in the 
highlands. If these things be done, and that soon, your 
country, I think, will be safe ; provided you establish a 
good government, with a strong executive. A pure democracy may possibly do, when patriotism is the ruling 
passion; but when the State abounds with rascals, as is the 
case with too many at this day, you must suppress a little 
of that popular spirit. Vest the executive powers of government in an individual, that they may have vigour, and 
let them be as ample as is consistent with the great outlines 
of freedom. As several of the reasons which operated mst you or Livingston's leaving the State are now 
removed, I think you would be of vast service in Congress. 
You know that body possesses its share of human weakness ; and that it is not impossible for the members of that 
House to have their attention engrossed by subjects which 
might as well be postponed for the present, while such as 
require despatch have been — I had almost said — neglected. 
This may he the case with the measures which should be 
taken. for the defence of your State. It is therefore your 
interest and your duty, if you are not prevented by some 
superior public concern, to attend the House, and that soon : 
you have a right to demand their attention, and I trust they 
will give you early assistance. 
</p><p>
Every intelligence from New- York for the last ten days 
convincing me that the enemy are preparing to attack 
the State with a large body of troops, I shall take the wings 
of the morning and hasten to mv native home ; where I 
shall endeavour to render my country more service in the 
field, than I have been able to render her in the cabinet. I 
have therefore little time to write, and none to lengthen this 
letter. I could not, however, think of quitting this part of 
the continent without writing you what appeared to me of 
consequence ; especially when I consider that it is probable, 
at least possible, that this may be the last time I may have 
it in my power to give you any evidence of my affection. 
I shall add no more than that you have my best wishes for 
your happiness, and that if I fall in the defence of my 
country, it will alleviate my misfortune to think that it is in 
the support of the best of causes, and that I am esteemed by 
one of the best of men. God bless you. Adieu, my friend. 
</p><p>
Yours, sincerely,

My dear Jay, 
</p><p>
It is a long time since we have had any correspondence, 
but I see no reason why it should be longer, when we have 
any thing to say, and leisure to say if, in. Such is just my 
situation ; for it is Christmas-day, and all the world (i. e. 
my clients) being either at their devotions or their amusements, I have time to tell you, and I fear with some 
reason (as it comes north about), that a damned infamous 
cabal is forming against our commander-in-chief, and that 
whenever they shall find themselves strong enough they 
will strike an important blow. I give you this hint, that 
you may be on your guard ; and I know you will excuse me 
for doing so, when you recollect that there are some men 
of our acquaintance who are in possession of all the qualities of the devil, his cunning n< >t excepted. Recollect the 
indirect attempts that were repeatedly made against the 
command and reputation of poor Schuyler, and the fatal 
stab that was at last aimed at both; and let us be taught 
how necessary it is to oppose a cabal in its infancy. Were 
it in my power, I would stifle it in its birth. Conway, the 
****, and ******* are said to be at the bottom of this, 
besides an abundance of snakes that are concealed in the 
grass. If these are not encouraged to come forward, they 
will continue where they are ; but if the former are permitted to bask in the sunshine of Congressional favour, the 
latter will soon spread themselves abroad, and an extended 
field will be immediately occupied by the factious and 
the ambitious. The fate of America will then be like the 
fate of most of the republics of antiquity, where the designing have supplanted the virtuous, and the worthy have been 
sacrificed to the views of the wicked. Indeed, my friend, 
if the Congress do not embrace every opportunity to extinguish that spirit of cabal and unworthy ambition, it will 
finally be more essentially injurious to the well-being of 
this continent than the sword of Sir Harry and his whole 
army. I view the body of which we were for a long time 
members, as possessing, in a very eminent degree, the 
powers of good and evil. It depends on those who manage 
the machine to determine its object. I hear you have 
returned to Congress, and I hope you will have your full 
share in the management. I do not know what gentleman 
we shall send from this State. We have some fine plants, 
nay, saplings, that will do wondrous well in a few years, 
but are too tender at present to bear up the weight of this 
continent. Were it now to be imposed upon them, it might 
check their growth, or, as they are the production of a 
southern clime, it is possible they might be blighted by a 
northern wind. When you write me, let me know how 
Robert R. Livingston is. Remember me to him, for I 
esteem him highly. God bless you, my dear Jay, and 
believe me to be, with great sincerity, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend,
