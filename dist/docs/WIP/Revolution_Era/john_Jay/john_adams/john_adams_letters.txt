My Dear Friend, 
</p><p>
I blush to acknowledge that I received your favour of 
the 6th February, in its season, and in good condition, and 
that I have not answered it. 
</p><p>
By leading a quiet life, and by great care and regular exercise, I have happily recovered a little health, and if you 
think it necessary, I might now venture on a journey to Paris. But I should be glad to wait here six weeks longer, 
that I may increase my stock of strength a little more, if possible, provided you will give me leave. I should be glad 
to know what you have upon the carpet, and how advanced, in brief, if you please. 
</p><p>
The money for the payment of <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Morris</a>'s bills is happily secured, but we were a long time in bringing the loan to bear. 
</p><p>
I have received several letters from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, from very good hands, which make very honourable and affectionate mention of you. You have erected a 
monument to your memory in every New-England heart. 
My regards to your good family, and believe me, 
</p><p>
Your sincere friend, 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Sketches of the Life and Character of Patrick Henry, by William Wirt, of <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, Virginia, has been sent to 
me by Mr. Shaw, of the Athenaeum. My family are reading it to me every evening, and though we have not finished 
it, we have proceeded far enough to excite an earnest desire to know your opinion of it. 
</p><p>
There is in section fourth, page 108, a passage which no 
man now living but yourself can explain. I hope you have 
read the volume ; but as it is possible you may not have 
seen it, the paragraph is this : 
</p><p>
" A petition to the king, an address to the people of 
Great Britain, and a memorial to the people of British 
America, were agreed to be drawn. Mr. Lee, <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='colleague'>Mr. Henry</a>, 
and others were appointed for the first ; Mr. Lee, Mr. Livingston, and <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Jay</a> for the two last. The splendour 
of their debut occasioned <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='colleague'>Mr. Henry</a> to be designated by 
his committee to draw the petition to the king, with which 
they were charged, and Mr. Lee was charged with the 
address to the people of England. The last was first reported. On reading it, great disappointment was expressed 
in every countenance, and a dead silence ensued for some 
minutes. At length it was laid on the table for perusal and 
consideration till the next day ; when first one member 
and then another arose, and paying some faint compliment, 
to the composition, observed that there were still certain 
considerations not expressed, which should properly find a 
place in it. The address was therefore committed for 
amendment; and one prepared by <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Jay</a>, and nil; red 
by Governor Livingston, was reported and adopted with 
scarcely an alteration. These facts were stated by a gentleman, to whom they were communicated by <a href='/results.php?tla=' rel=''>Mr, Pendleton</a> and Mr. Harrison, of the Virginia delegation (except 
that Mr. Harrison erroneously ascribed the draught to 
Governor Livingston), and to whom they were afterward 
confirmed by Governor Livingston himself. <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='colleague'>Mr. Henry</a>'s 
draught of a petition to the king was equally unsuccessful, 
and was recommitted for amendment. Mr. John Dickinson (the author of the Farmers Letters) was added to the 
committee, and a new draught prepared by him was 
adopted." 
</p><p>
This passage is not so luminous as many parts of the 
book; but as I understand it, I think it is not correct. 
There is no man now living who is able perfectly to correct it but yourself; and in my opinion, it is your conscientious duty to do it. 
The question, " Who was the draughtsman of the address 
to the people of England ?" however unimportant to the 
public it may appear at this day, certainly excited a sensation, a fermentation, and a schism in Congress at the time, 
and serious consequences afterward, which have lasted to 
this hour, and are not yet spended. I fear, bat I do not 
know, that this animosity was occasioned by indiscretions 
of R. II. Lee, <a href='/results.php?tla=sam' rel=''>Mr. Samuel Adams</a>, and some others of the 
Virginia delegates, by whom Adams was led into error. I 
never had a doubt that you were the author of that manly 
and noble address. But as the subject is now brought 
before the public by Mr. Wirt, and will excite speculation, 
you, who alone are capable of it, ought to explain it, and, as 
I know you will, if at all, without favour or affection. 
I am, sir, with friendship as of old, 
</p><p>
Your most respectful humble servant, 
</p><p>
