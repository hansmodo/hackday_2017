Sir, 
</p><p>
For your favour of the 31st ult. with the enclosed bill, 
be pleased to accept my most grateful acknowledgments. 
The interest you have manifested in my labours, and the 
liberality accompanying it, are the more acceptable, as they 
have been unsolicited. 
</p><p>
It is not improbable that some ill-founded apprehensions 
that I might attempt changes of orthography, have had their 
effect in preventing subscriptions ; but there are several 
other causes. 
</p><p>
On the subject of orthography, gentlemen might have 
been easy, as any considerable changes must prevent the 
sale and use of a work of this sort, and they might rationally conclude that I would not put myself to an immense 
trouble and expense, to write a book which would not find 
purchasers. 
</p><p>
My plan is different from any thing before attempted. I 
have examined and collated the radical words in twenty 
languages, including the seven Asiatic languages, or rather 
dialects of the Assyrian stock. This will enable me to 
explain many things in the English language which have 
hitherto been obscure. Indeed, this research has opened a 
field entirely new, and it is probable will lead to many 
important discoveries, not only in the origin and affinity of 
languages, but in history sacred and profane. 
</p><p>
The price of the work cannot be known at present ; but 
if I live to complete it, I shall not only present you a copy, 
but hold myself answerable to refund the principal of the 
sum advanced. 
</p><p>
With gratitude and respect, I am sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
When I began the compilation of a large Dictionary of 
the English language, I limited my views chiefly to a correction of such errors as had escaped former compilers, and 
the supply of such new terms as have sprung from modern 
improvements in science. But in searching for the originals 
of English words, I soon found the field of etymology had been imperfectly explored ; and one discovery succeeding 
another, my curiosity was excited to persevere in the pursuit. At length, finding no safe clew to conduct me through the labyrinth, I adopted a new plan of investigation - that 
of examining and comparing the primary elements, articulations, or consonants of words in twenty different languages or dialects ; the vowels having been found so mutable as to be of no use. 
</p><p>
The result of this examination, has been the formation of a synopsis of radical words in more than twenty languages, 
which is complete, or nearly so. This will probably form a quarto, and be an appendix to the dictionary. This has 
occupied about ten years ; but I do not, and I think the world will not regret the delay which this has occasioned ; 
for if I am not deceived, the discoveries proceeding from this investigation will be quite important, and as new in 
Europe as in America. This synopsis exhibits a vast number of affinities between the languages examined, which 
have never before been detected. But what I think of more value, this investigation has developed, in a multitude of 
words, the primary sense of the root, which has not hitherto been known. There is a primary or radical sense of every 
verb, from which all its significations in customary use, are naturally and easily deducible ; and from an ignorance of 
this sense, and the manner in which men have proceeded from the literal to the metaphorical significations, the most 
learned critics have often been perplexed in determining the particular sense of words. For instance, a Hebrew word 
signifies to bless and to curse. With the knowledge of the primary sense, these difficulties vanish. 
</p><p>
The languages of which I have made a synopsis, are the Chaldaic, Syriac, Arabic, Samaritan, Hebrew, Ethiopic, Persian, Irish (Hiberno Celtic), Armoric, Anglo Saxon, 
German, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Russian, with the English. 
</p><p>
I am now proceeding with the dictionary, and I am engaged in the letter H. Making my past progress the basis 
of calculation, it must require the constant labour of four years to complete the work, even if my health should be 
continued. For this blessing I rely tranquilly on the goodness and forbearance of that Being, whose favour I desire to 
seek in the way which he has prescribed, and which I trust I value above any temporal good. 
</p><p>
But I did not begin my studies early enough. I am now sixty-three years of age, and after ibis age, a small portion 
only of active life remains. If, however, I should not be permitted to finish the work begun, the synopsis will enable 
some other person to pursue the plan with advantage, so that my labour will not be lost to my country. 
</p><p>
I have thought, that after submitting my MSS. to able judges, if they should think the work to have merit enough 
to command a sale in England, I may visit that country, and attempt to sell the copy there first ; and indeed revise 
the w r ork at <a href='/results.php?city=oxford' rel='city'>Oxford</a>. But on this I am not determined. 
What course I shall pursue is not certain. I am contented to leave the event to that good Providence which has hitherto supported me. 
</p><p>
The evening before your letter arrived, I was conversing respecting you, sir; and I said to my family, that there are 
few men whom I wish so much to see as <a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="met friend">Gov. Jay</a>. If our lives should be spared till next summer, I will make an 
effort to visit you. However this may be, I shall never forget your public services, nor your private friendship for, 
Sir, your most obliged and obedient servant,
