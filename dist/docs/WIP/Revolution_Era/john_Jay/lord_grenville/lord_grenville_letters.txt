My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I cannot resist the desire I feel of availing myself of the 
opportunity of the first packet since your departure, to 
express to you how happy you would make me by allowing me occasionally to recall to your recollection, in this 
manner, one who will always entertain for you the most 
sincere esteem and friendship. I am particularly anxious 
to hear of your safe arrival, and that you have found your 
family and friends well. These are points paramount to 
all other considerations ; but I know your return to your 
country will not be fully satisfactory to you, unless you 
have also found the state of public affairs such as to promise 
the continuance of good order and tranquillity. That it 
may be so no one more sincerely wishes than myself, and 
it would be a great satisfaction for me to hear it from you. 
</p><p>
Since you left us, the news of the arrival of the treaty in America has reached us. We were singularly unfortunate 
in the loss of the Tankenville packet. By a strange negligence, the November and December mails from hence were 
both put on board that ship, without our having any notice 
of it from the post-office ; so that while I thought we were 
sending duplicates by two different conveyances, we were 
in fact sending them by the same vessel. My letters to 
Governor Simcoe, which I have frequently mentioned to 
you, and my despatches to Mr. Hammond on the subject 
of the treaty, were on board the same ship ; so that this 
accident has thrown us far back in the arrangement of many 
material points. I hope, however, that with attention, and 
a continuance on the part of the two governments of the 
same disposition which actuated all our communications 
and negotiations here, the great work which we have begun 
will be carried to its full extent. 
</p><p>
I have not been inattentive to the points which remain to 
be settled here. One of the most material is, I flatter myself, in a train of being well arranged. I mean that which 
relates to the admiralty courts in the West Indies, which it 
is in contemplation immediately to diminish in point of 
number, so as to have them only at Jamaica, Barbadoes, 
Grenada, Antigua, and Martinique. Knowing, as I do, how 
much evil has been produced by the multiplication of these 
courts, I look to this reduction with very sanguine hopes. 
But I hope the regulation will not stop here, but that the 
effect of it may lead to render the practice of those which 
will remain more correct and cautious than I fear it has 
hitherto been. 
</p><p>
The impossibility of our receiving the ratification of the 
treaty till quite the end of July, leaves us no chance of 
being able to propose to parliament, during the present 
session, those matters connected with the treaty in which 
the interference of the legislature is necessary. I know 
that this delay will be misconstrued on your side of the 
water ; but it is unavoidable. I requested <a href="/results.php?tla=top" rel="colleague met">Mr. Pinckney</a>, 
before he went to Spain, to write to America on this point, 
in order that the explanation of it might not rest merely on 
the communications of our minister there. You will be 
able to speak with still more knowledge and effect to the 
same point. Whatever does not depend on the repeal or 
alteration of existing laws, will be immediately executed on 
the receipt of the ratification. 
</p><p>
The public papers and other communications will inform 
you fully of the state of affairs in Europe. The dispositions 
of the people in France are evidently turning very fast to 
the establishment of some settled order, which may relieve 
them from the miseries of their present anarchy. In a 
similar situation in this country, we experienced the advantage of a known and moderate form of government under 
which the nation had before been happy, and to which, therefore, it returned with enthusiasm and almost with unanimity. 
The want of such a standard to resort to is now, as far as 
I can judge, the great obstacle to the restoration of order in 
France, and, consequently, of peace in Europe. Mild as 
their old government was in its practice, it was attended 
with many circumstances the renewal of which creates 
great apprehension and uneasiness ; and there is no authority 
of sufficient weight to prescribe the form and limits of any 
change. Some of the belligerent powers are, as you will 
have seen, too impatient to wait the result of this doubtful 
issue. To others, all idea of peace which shall not give 
better security than the signature of the committee of 
safety, or the ratification of the convention, seems delusive 
and dangerous ; and to this sentiment I profess myself 
strongly inclined. You are happy in America if you can 
avoid, as I trust you will, the dangers both of the war and 
of the peace. 
</p><p>
With the sincerest wishes for your prosperity, 
Believe me, sir, 
Your most attached and faithful humble servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I cannot let Mr. Listen go, without taking the occasion 
of his departure to recommend him to you, and to express 
my hope that his character and conduct will be found well 
calculated to continue and promote that harmony, which it 
was the object of our labours to establish. I have, since 
you left us, taken one occasion to renew to you my assurances of the sincere esteem and friendship with which your 
whole conduct has impressed me, and of the high sense 
which I entertain of your virtues and talents. It is a great 
satisfaction to one, when, in the course of so many unpleasant 
discussions as a public man must necessarily be engaged 
in, he is able to look back upon any of them with as much 
pleasure, as I derived from that which procured me the 
advantage of friendship and intercourse with a man valuable on every account. You, I trust, saw enough of me to 
know that these expressions are not, on my part, compliments of course, but that they proceed from sentiments of 
real esteem and regard. 
</p><p>
I need not tell you with how much pleasure, on every 
account, I have learned that the public in the United States 
are recovering from the delusion into which they had been 
led, and that justice is now done by the country at large, as 
it was before by well informed and well principled men, to 
the uprightness and ability of your conduct. I, on my part, 
should have thought, that I very ill consulted the interests 
of my own country, if I had been desirous of terminating 
the points in discussion between us, on any other footing 
than that of mutual justice and reciprocal advantage ; nor 
do I conceive that any just objection can be stated to the 
great work which we jointly accomplished, except on the 
part of those who believe the interest of Great Britain and 
the United States to be in contradiction with each other, 
or who wish to make them so. 
</p><p>
It would be a great gratification to me to learn occasionally that you are well, and that you retain a friendly recollection of one who is, with the greatest sincerity, 
Most truly and faithfully, 
</p><p>
Your obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It is a great satisfaction to me to have to acknowledge 
two of your letters, and to be allowed the hope of hearing 
from you more frequently. I should have been very sorry 
to think that I w T as wholly out of your recollection, as I frequently reflect with pleasure on the opportunity I had of 
becoming acquainted with a character which I saw so much 
reason to esteem. 
</p><p>
Mr. Gore delivered to me, a few days ago, your letter of 
introduction. He seems to be a sensible and moderate 
man, and I shall have great pleasure both in facilitating, as 
far as may depend on me, the public objects of his mission, 
and in showing him any private attention and civility 
that maybe in my power. I think he and his colleague 
will be well satisfied with the choice which has been made 
here for that commission. Both Dr. Xieoll and Mr. Ansty 
are known (in some degree) in America, the former by 
character, the latter personally; and I trust the appointment has proved the spirit in which it was made. If I do 
not deceive myself, the choice of the commissioners who 
are going to America will not be less satisfactory. Their 
names are not yet announced, but I look upon the appointment as very nearly, if not quite, fixed. 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 1st of May was delivered to me two 
days ago, and I take the opportunity of this mail to answer 
it. I have the greatest pleasure in hearing from you, that 
you consider the questions which have agitated America 
since your arrival as determined. I think we always felt 
that even after the great points were adjusted, and a foundation of solid friendship laid, something must be still left for 
the operation of time and temper. Where so much heat 
has prevailed, irritation will remain among individuals, and 
will occasionally produce inconvenience and embarrassment 
to both governments. Mutual good disposition and confidence, a uniform and steady conduct in great points, and 
moderation respecting those of less importance, must ultimately surmount these difficulties, as they have already 
surmounted others which were much greater. 
</p><p>
With respect to the impressments, I am confident that 
such orders as you speak of have been more than once 
repeated. I speak from general impression, not having had 
opportunity to ascertain the fact since I received your 
letter. But I think I can answer for it that they shall be 
renewed. In this country, much of the detail of that business has fallen within my own knowledge ; and I can say 
positively, that I do not think one instance can be brought 
where a seaman has not been discharged, who could produce, I do not say proof, but any probable, or even plausible ground for supposing him a native citizen of the United 
States, or a resident there at the time of the separation from 
this country. In some instances, the conduct observed has 
been so favourable, that within the last week, before I 
received your letter, two men were discharged, one on producing a certificate of an American consul here, which did 
not recite on what grounds or from what proof it was 
given, but merely asserted the fact that the bearer was an 
American citizen ; and the other, on producing a paper 
neither certified nor attested, but purporting to be a discharge from an American regiment of militia, — a paper 
which, even if genuine, may, as you will easily see, have 
passed into twenty hands before it was produced here. 
</p><p>
I saw in the proceedings of the last session of the Congress, some steps taken towards a regular establishment 
for the granting certificates. If such an establishment were 
formed, with proper and sufficient checks to prevent its 
being abused, the effect would be to do away the greatest 
part of our difficulties on the subject. But I much fear that 
the ideas prevalent in America on the subject of emigration, will prevent this ever being well or satisfactorily done. 
</p><p>
I have been led into this discussion by what you say of 
the advantage which might arise from giving orders, which 
I am confident have been repeatedly given. The assurances of Mr. Liston on the subject will also, I trust, be 
such as you seem to desire. 
</p><p>
I beg you to believe that you cannot do a thing more 
agreeable to me, or, perhaps, more useful to the interest 
of both our countries, than in expressing to me at all times, 
freely and without reserve, your opinion as to the means 
of maintaining that spirit which we jointly laboured to establish. This may be a means of rendering our correspondence greatly and permanently beneficial. Agreeable to 
me it can never fail to be, while it conveys to me information of your welfare, and gives me the opportunity of 
assuring you of the very sincere esteem and regard with 
which 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, my dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most faithful and obedient humble servant,
