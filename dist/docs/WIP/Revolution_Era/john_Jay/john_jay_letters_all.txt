</p><p>
Dear Colonel, 
</p><p>
When the clerk of the Congress gave me the printed 
papers which I enclosed you, he told me they contained the 
navy establishment. Whatever deficiencies there may be 
in them as to that matter, will I hope be supplied by the 
extract now enclosed. 
</p><p>
As to continental colours, the Congress have made no 
order as yet concerning them, and I believe the captains of 
their armed vessels have in that particular been directed 
by their own fancies and inclinations. I remember to have 
seen a flag designed for one of them, on which was extremely well painted a large rattlesnake, rearing his crest 
and shaking his rattles, with this motto, " Don't tread on 
me," but whether this device was generally adopted by the 
fleet, I am not able to say, — I rather think it was not. 
</p><p>
I am by no means without my apprehensions of danger 
from that licentiousness which in your situation is not uncommon ; nothing will contribute more to its suppression 
than a vigorous exertion of the powers vested in your 
Convention and Committee of Safety, at least till more 
regular forms can be introduced. The tenderness shown 
to some wild people on account of their supposed attachment to the cause, has been of disservice. Their eccentric 
behaviour, by passing unreproved, has gained countenance, 
and has lessened your authority, and diminished that dignity 
so essential and necessary to give weight and respect to 
your ordinances. Some o£ your own people are daily 
instigated (if not employed) to calumniate and abuse the 
whole province, and misrepresent all their actions and 
intentions. One in particular has had the impudence to 
intimate to certain persons that your battalions last campaign were not half full, and that Schaick's regiment had 
more officers than privates ; others report that you have 
all along supplied the men-of-war with whatever they 
pleased to have, and through them our enemies in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. 
By tales like these they pay their court to people who have 
more ostensible consequence than real honesty, and more 
cunning than wisdom. 
</p><p>
I am happy to find that our intermeddling in the affair of 
the test is agreeable to you. For Cod's sake resist all such 
attempts for the future. 
</p><p>
Your own discernment has pointed out to you the principle of Lord Stirling's advancement ; had the age of a 
colonel's commission been a proper rule, it would have 
determined in favour of some colonel at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, many 
of whose commissions are prior in date to any in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. The spirit you betray on this occasion becomes a 
soldier. 
</p><p>
The enclosed copy of a resolve of Congress will, I hope, 
settle all doubts relative to rank, which may arise from 
your new commission. The consequence you drew from 
that circumstance was more ingenious than solid, for I can 
assure you that the Congress were not disposed to do any 
thing wrong or uncivil ; and I can also add, that your not 
having joined your regiment last summer has been explained to their satisfaction, as far as I am able to judge. 
"With respect to this, however, as well as some other matters, I shall defer particulars till we meet. In a word, with 
some men in these as in other times, a man must either be 
their tool and be despised, or act a firm disinterested part 
and be abused. The latter has in one or two matters 
been your fate, as well as that of many other good men. 
Adieu. 
</p><p>

Dear Colonel, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for your friendly letter of the 16th 
instant, and its enclosures, which contain useful as well as 
agreeable information. I am glad to see <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> doing 
something in the naval way, and think the encouragement 
given by your Convention to the manufacture of arms, 
powder, saltpetre, and sea salt, does them honour. 
</p><p>
Many of the reasons you allege for delaying taxation are 
weighty, and I confess did not occur to me. It is certainly 
unreasonable to impose on the city, in its present circumstances, so great a share of the public expenses. 
</p><p>
The late election, so far as it respects yourself, has taken 
a turn I did not expect, and am at a loss to account for, 
except on the principle of your holding a military office, or 
that mutability which from various causes often strongly 
marks popular opinions of men and measures in times like 
these. But whatever may have been the reason, I am persuaded that the zeal you have shown and the sacrifices you 
have made in this great cause will always afford you the 
most pleasing reflections, and will one day not only merit, 
but receive the gratitude of your fellow-citizens. Posterity 
you know always does justice. Let no circumstances of 
this kind diminish your ardour ; but by persevering in a 
firm, uniform course of conduct, silence detraction and 
compel approbation. 
</p><p>
I am much obliged to you for your kind attention to my 
house ; and be assured that I shall omit no opportunity of 
evincing the esteem and sincerity with which I am 
Your friend and humble servant,

Dear Robert, 
</p><p>
The pleasure I expected from a junction of all our families at Bristol has vanished. Dr. Bard tells me the waters 
there would be injurious to Mrs. Jay's complaints ; so that 
I shall again take a solitary ride to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, whenever the Convention, who directed me to abide here until their 
further order, shall think proper to dismiss me. 
</p><p>
Messrs. Also]) and Lewis set out next Saturday for 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 3Ir. Duane informs me that he is about to 
return home, and considering how long he has been absent 
from his family, I think him entitled to that indulgence. I 
pray God that your health may enable you to attend constantly, at least till it may be in my power to relieve you. 
Is Mr. Clinton returned? 
</p><p>
Our Convention will, I believe, institute a better government than the present, which in my opinion will no longer 
work an}' thing but mischief; and although the measure of 
obtaining authority by instructions may have its advocates, 
I have reason to think that such a resolution will be taken 
as will open a door to the election of new or additional 
members. But be the resolution what it may, you shall 
have the earliest advice of it. And should my conjectures 
prove right, I shall inform the members of Duchess of your 
readiness to serve, and advise them to elect you. 
</p><p>
Don't be uneasy at receiving so few letters from me. I 
have been so distressed by the ill health of my wife and 
parents, that I have scarce written any thing.

Dear Rutledge, 
</p><p>
Be so kind as to forward the enclosed by the first opportunity to your brother. It is in answer to one from him to 
Messrs. Duane, Wm. Livingston, and myself, mentioning 
the losses sustained by General Lee in consequence of 
entering into the American service, and recommending a 
compliance with the resolution of Congress for indemnify
* Member of Congress at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>.ing him. As he has doubtless written to you on the subject, 
I forbear enlarging on the propriety, policy, or justice of the 
measure. I am for my own part clear for it, and wish with 
all my heart that it may take place: I shall write to my 
colleagues on the subject. 
</p><p>
Let no considerations induce you to excuse <a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague'>General Mifflin</a> from the office of quarter-master-general. Moyland 
acted wisely and honestly in resigning. Try no new experiments : you have paid for the last. Let me repeat it — keep Mifflin. 
</p><p>
Although extremely anxious to be with you, the circumstances of this State will not admit of my leaving it. Governor Tryon has been very mischievous ; and we find our 
hands full in counteracting and suppressing the conspiracies 
formed by him and his adherents. 
</p><p>
What is your fleet and noble admiral doing ? What 
meekness of wisdom and what tender-hearted charity ! I 
can't think of it with patience. Nothing but more than 
lady-like delicacy could have prevailed on your august body 
to secrete the sentence they passed upon that pretty genius. 
I reprobate such mincing, little, zigzag ways of doing 
business : either openly acquit, or openly condemn. 
</p><p>
If General Lee should be at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, pray hasten 
his departure — he is much wanted at New- York. I wish 
our army well stationed in the highlands, and all the lower 
country desolated ; we might then bid defiance to all the 
further efforts of the enemy on that quarter. 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obliging letters of the 18th ult. and 3d inst., after 
passing through various hands and places, were at length 
delivered to me two days ago. Your elegant panegyric 
on the amiable character and benevolent designs of his 
Britannic majesty meets with general approbation ; and 
some do not hesitate to predict that it will stimulate your 
gracious prince to embrace the first opportunity of exalting 
you. On reading the proclamation against picking and stealing, I could not forbear wishing there had been one 
pasted on the foreheads of our late protectors. Nothing 
but the chance of their being predestined to go to heaven 
can save them from a campaign in the opposite regions. 
The least they can expect, with any degree of modesty, is 
to be decimated. They seem to have acted as if they 
thought themselves tenants in common in all the good 
things they met with, and that posterior, instead of prior 
occupancy, enabled them to hold in severalty. 
</p><p>
At a time when the most strenuous efforts are necessary 
to our political salvation, it is to be regretted that any of 
our measures should bear the marks of feeble or dispirited 
counsels. Your militia bill should have been so framed as 
to give birth to strong and decisive executive powers. I 
should have thought the spirit of the speech, added to the 
remembrance of the barbarous ravages of the enemy, 
would have diffused through the Legislature a degree of 
resentment, determination, and enthusiasm, which would 
have been productive of regulations better adapted to the 
times. 
</p><p>
I am, my dear sir, 
With the greatest respect and esteem,

My dear Sally, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for your affectionate letters of the 17th 
and 21st instant. I am happy to hear of the health of yourself and son, and am pleased with your candour and sincerity on that subject. 
</p><p>
We have lately received an uncertain, though unpleasant, 
account of the enemy's landing at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. How did 
your nerves bear the shock ? My father and mother, I 
apprehend, were very uneasy. I should be happy, were it 
in my power, to bear all their as well as your misfortunes. 
The infirmities of age, added to the terrors and calamities 
of war, conspire in depriving them of ease and enjoyment. 
I most sensiBly feel for and pity them. God grant them the 
only remedy against the evils inseparable from humanity — 
fortitude founded on resignation. The moment I may 
suspect you to be exposed to clanger I shall set out for <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>. As yet I think you very safe ; for, if the reports we 
have heard be true, the enemy's force is not sufficient to 
penetrate the country. 
</p><p>
I congratulate Peter on his recovery and return. Remind him of sending to Captain Piatt's for the barley. Let 
not the fear of the enemy deter him from pursuing the business of the farm. The same <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> which enables us 
to sow may enable us to reap.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Mr. Cuyler informs me, that some of my friends in your 
county have done me the honour of naming me, among 
other candidates, for the office of governor. 
</p><p>
In my opinion I can be more useful in the place I now 
hold ; and therefore, though the other is far more respectable as well as lucrative, yet, sir, the regard due to the public good induces me to decline this promotion. 
</p><p>
I thought it necessary that you and others should be 
informed of my sentiments on this subject ; and it would 
give me pleasure to hear, that the electors in <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> had 
united in a design of voting for some one gentleman whose 
spirit, abilities, and reputation might recommend him to 
that important office. 
</p><p>
Our constitution is universally approved, even in NewEngland, where few New-York productions have credit. 
But, unless the government be committed to proper hands, 
it will be weak and unstable at home, and contemptible 
abroad. For my own part, I know of no person at present 
whom I would prefer to <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a>.

My dear Sally, 
</p><p>
Having a few leisure hours allotted, me by this day of 
general rest, I shall divide them between Heaven and yourself ; being persuaded that while I do my duty to both, my 
expectations of happiness will not be vain. 
</p><p>
When I consider that one of the reasons assigned for the 
creation of woman was, " that it is not good for man to be 
alone," I find my present situation condemned, not only by 
my own feelings, but by divine authority. I assure you, 
I am tired of it ; and, were there not many reasons to conjecture that the enemy will bend their course this way, we 
should not remain much longer separated ; but, as it would 
be cruel to expose you to scenes of anxiety and distress, I 
must endeavour to bear your absence at least with patience, 
and to please myself with the expectation of shortly seeing 
the return of those happy days, when we shall again " sit 
under our own vine, and under our own fig-tree, and there 
be none to make us afraid." 
</p><p>
As soon as the Council of Safety dissolves, which will be 
at the meeting of the Legislature, you may expect to see 
me for a few days ; but when that event will take place is 
uncertain. Should this State become the seat of war, and 
be attacked on both sides, it will not be practicable to convene the Legislature, nor indeed would it be proper for me, 
in such a conjuncture, to be absent. 
As the enemy are now expelled from Jersey, and Liberty 
Hall is again free, I fancy Susan has become as joyous as 
ever, and that the whole family arc not a little anxious to 
put an end to their exile. 
</p><p>
I returned last Wednesday from <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>. My father 
declines fast. His late loss affects him exceedingly ; he 
gives way to silence and retirement, spending hours every 
day in that melancholy room ; and though he appears calm 
and resigned, the effects of this inauspicious event are visible upon him. How few possess such sensibility, or are 
capable of affections so permanent and so delicate ! 
</p><p>

dear Sally, how acceptable a line from you always is to

Dear General, 
</p><p>
Your very friendly letter of the 6th ult. was this moment 
delivered. I am happy to find your firmness unimpaired, 
and your attachment to your country unabated by its ingratitude. Justice will yet take place, and I do not despair 
of seeing the time when it will be confessed that the foundation of our success in the northern department, was laid by 
the present commander's predecessor. I am nevertheless 
anxious that such authentic evidence of the propriety of 
your conduct, should be transmitted to posterity as may 
contradict the many lies which will be told them by writers 
under impressions and under an influence unfriendly to 
your reputation. This subject merits attention. Facts, 
and not a single resolution of Congress, will in my opinion 
be effectual to do the business. I have thought much of 
this matter, but more of this when we meet. 
</p><p>
Your offer of a farm, &c, is very obliging : be pleased 
to accept my thanks for it. I am at present at a loss how 
to determine. Let not my delay, however, be injurious to 
you. This place, at which all the family now reside, is by 
no means agreeable or convenient, if secure, which is also 
doubtful. I purpose doing myself the pleasure of seeing 
you this winter, and shall then avail myself of your advice. 
</p><p>
The rapidity with which the desolation of your seat at 
<a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a> is repairing, does not surprise me. I remember 
the despatch with which the preparations for our first expedition into Canada were completed. I wish the repair of 
our forts, &c., in the river was in the same train. 
</p><p>
As to your loss of influence among a certain body, it is 
less so than you may imagine. The virtuous and sensible 
still retain their former sentiments. The residue ever will 
be directed by accident and circumstances. Few possess 
honesty or spirit enough openly to defend unpopular merit, 
and by their c permit calumny to gain strength, 
</p><p>
These, however, are temporary evils, and you do well to 
despise them. 
</p><p>
I am, my dear sir, very sincerely,

I hope you will seriously determine to serve your country, 
at least in a legislative capacity. Class yourself with those 
great men of antiquity, who, unmoved by the ingratitude 
of their country, omitted no opportunities of promoting the 
public weal. In this field malice cannot prevent your 
reaping laurels, and remember that the present state of our 
affairs offers you a plentiful harvest. Set about it then, my

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
As an opportunity of going to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> will not probably 
be given me during the session of the Legislature, and as I 
have too long kept you in suspense relative to the farm you 
was so kind as to offer me, I ought now to acquaint you 
that I am under a necessity of denying myself the pleasure 
of being your neighbour. My father's infirmities have so 
increased as to render a removal to <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a> so inconveniert and painful, if practicable, that he cannot prevail 
upon himself to undertake it. So that, my dear sir, filial 
obligations will constrain me to continue in his neighbourhood.

Dear Morris, 
</p><p>
Your favour of the 1st of February came to hand last 
week. It gives me pleasure to hear you was then at headquarters, especially on business so important and perplexed. 
It is time that inquiries, as well as punishments, should become more frequent. I wish better, or rather more, use 
was made of courts-martial. Why is the inquiry directed 
to be made into the causes to which we are to ascribe the 
loss of fort Montgomery, &c, so long delayed. Had it 
been immediately after that event took place, the river 
would now have been well fortified, and a general at the 
head of the troops in the southern part of the State. 
</p><p>
Pennsylvania, I believe, is sick unto death. It will nevertheless recover, though perhaps not soon. Weak and bad 
constitutions incline to chronical disorders. 
Were I sure that this letter would reach you uninspected, 
I should commit many things to paper worth your knowledge, but which would give you little pleasure or surprise ; 
but as it is uncertain who will be the bearer, they must be 
reserved for the present. God bless you, and give you 
diligence and patience. Where you arc, both are necessary. 
</p><p>

Dear Morris, 
</p><p>
My last to you was written about a week ago. I am 
now engaged in the most disagreeable part of my duty, 
trying criminals. They multiply exceedingly. Robberies 
become frequent : the woods afford them shelter, and the 
tories food. Punishments must of course become certain, 
and mercy dormant — a harsh system, repugnant to my 
feelings, but nevertheless necessary. In such circumstances 
lenity would be cruelty, and severity is found on the side 
of humanity. 
</p><p>
The influence of Lord North's conciliatory plan is happily counterbalanced by the intelligence from France. 
There was danger of its creating divisions. A desire of 
peace is natural to a harassed people ; and the mass of 
mankind prefer present ease to the arduous exertions often 
necessary to ensure permanent tranquillity. 
</p><p>
What the French treaty may be, I know not. If Britain 
would acknowledge our independence, and enter into a 
liberal alliance with us, I should prefer a connexion with 
her to a league with any power on earth. Whether those 
objects be attainable, experience only can determine. I 
suspect the commissioners will have instructions to exceed 
their powers, if necessary. Peace, at all events, is, in my 
opinion, the wish of the minister. I hope the present favourable aspect of our affairs will neither make us arrogant or 
careless. Moderation in prosperity marks great minds, 
and denotes a generous people. Your game is now in a 
delicate situation, and the least bad play may ruin it. I 
view a return to the domination of Britain with horror, and 
would risk all for independence ; but that point ceded, I 
would give them advantageous commercial terms. The 
destruction of Old England would hurt me ; I wish it well : 
it afforded my ancestors an asylum from persecution. 
</p><p>
Parties here are still in a ferment. I hope it will be the 
means of purging off much scum and dross. I can't be particular. This letter may never reach you. 
</p><p>
I expect in a few days to see <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a> ; and 
my importunities shall not be wanting to urge him to 
join you without delay. The people grow more reconciled 
to him. 
</p><p>
The military departments here, I believe, are well managed. The commissary deserves credit. Handsome things 
are said of the quarter-master ; and there is one at the 
head of the artillery, who appears to me to have much 
merit. The park elaboratory and stores are in high order. 
There is the appearance of regularity, care, and attention 
in all the public works. As \<> the hospital I can say little, 
not being as yet well-informed. Conway is pleased with 
Schuyler, and manages the Vermont troops properly ; but 
of this say nothing. I fancy he does not well understand 
the views of his patron. Neither of them ought to know 
this. 
</p><p>
The clothier-general, once the Duke of Bolton's butler, 
is an anti-Washington. An ignorant butcher is issuing 
commissary. Let me again hint to you the propriety of 
restraining the staff from trade : besides general reasons, 
there are particular ones. Many good cannon remain yet 
at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> — strange neglect. Remember Vermont. 
Why do the marine committee keep Tudor in pay? I 
can't hear that he does any thing for it.

Dear Robert, 
</p><p>
Not a single line have you received from me since my 
arrival. This, you may say, does not look very friendly. 
I confess it, and, what is more in my favour, feel it. 
</p><p>
Business, I know, cannot excuse a total silence, though it 
may palliate a partial one. I won't plead it, for I never 
admitted it ; nor do I now write merely to keep fair with 
my own principles. Inclination, more than consistency, 
prompts me on this occasion. 
</p><p>
I presume your Legislature is by this time convened. 
Now is the season for exertion. Attend regularly. Confirm those who esteem you and their country. Convert or 
confound those who would sacrifice either to private views. 
Will any consideration induce you to visit another quarter of the globe ? I don't know that you will be called 
upon, but 1 am not sure that you may not. My conduct 
will be greatly influenced by your inclination. 
</p><p>
I had almost persuaded myself to write a letter to your 
brother Nod, urging him to come to this college, and offering my service to prepare the way for his reception. But 
as, on reflection, I apprehend it might stimulate him to a 
measure in which, perhaps, his mamma or brother might 
not concur, I decline it for the present. I cannot forbear, 
however, observing to you, that, in my opinion, his genius 
and his years call for a further degree of cultivation than 
can be obtained at Hurley. I wish to be useful to every 
lad of talents and cleverness ; and I assure you that desire 
will alwavs be increased, when these recommendations are 
possessed by one so nearly connected with a gentleman 
and a family who have particular claims to my esteem and 
respect. 
</p><p>
I am your friend, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>.

P.S. Don't be too lazy or too busy to let me know how you do.

Dear Robert, 
</p><p>
Your favour of the third instant came to hand this 
morning. The satisfaction my letter afforded you flatters 
as well as pleases me. It argues a remembrance of former 
times ; for which, and other reasons, I shall give you no 
more opportunities of joining the assembly of angels in 
rejoicing over penitent mortals. Not that I mean on the 
one hand to enter the state of reprobation and become a 
hardened sinner, or on the other enlist with those saints who 
slip not with their foot. 
This letter, written on the very da}' I received yours, 
will become evidence of my having gone through the 
whole process of amendment. Divines, you know, describe 
it as consisting of conviction, contrition, and conversion. 
Whether I shall persevere or not is a subject on which lime 
will utter the surest prophecies. 
</p><p>
The complexions of resignation, of soft complaint, and 
joyless sensibility, are so blended in your letter, that if 
anonymous, one would suppose it written by a wayworn 
traveller through this vale of tears, who, journeying towards 
his d'^tant haven through sultry and dreary paths, at length 
lays his languid limbs under some friendly shade, and permits the effusions of his soul to escape in words. My 
friend, a mind unbraced and nerves relaxed are not fit company for each other. It was not a man whom the poet tells 
us pined in thought, and sat like patience on a monument 
smiling at grief. In such rugged times as these other sensations are to be cherished. Rural scenes, domestic bliss, 
and the charming group of pleasures found in the train of 
peace, fly at the approach <>!' war, and are seldom to be 
found in Melds stained with blood, or habitations polluted by 
outrage and desolation. 1 admire your sensibility, nor 
would I wish to see less milk in your veins ; you would be 
less amiable. In my opinion, however, your reasoning is 
not quite just. I think a man's happiness requires that he 
should condescend to keep himself free from fleas and 
wasps, as well as from thi ves and robbers. 
</p><p>
When the present session of your Legislature is ended, 
take a ride and see us. You will find many here happy to 
see you. I have something, though not very interesting, to 
say to you on the subject of politics, but as it is now very 
late, and I have been writing letters constantly since dinner, 
I am really too much fatigued to proceed. Make my compliments to Mrs. Livingston, who I presume is with you. 
Adieu. I am, your friend,

Sir,

When characters rendered amiable by virtues and important by talents, are exposed to suspicions, and become subjects of investigation, the sensibility of individuals

It gives me, therefore, great pleasure to transmit to you

Dear Robert, 
</p><p>
Mr. Sands delivered me your favour of the 4th inst. 
yesterday. It gave me much pleasure. The length, the 
subject, and the spirit of it pleased me : unless the pain my 
last occasioned was severe, I don't regret it. That vou 
have deserved well of your country is confessed, and that 
you became latterly a little relaxed is not disputable. You 
have never been thrown out or distanced in the pursuit of 
virtue ; but, like some game horses, you sometimes want 
the whip. This is a coarse simile. Friendship will pardon it. 
</p><p>
That full confidence which induced you to think loud, 
natters me. The like returns are due, and shall be paid. 
But letters in our davs are dangerous convevances of our 
sentiments on many subjects. I seldom write without 
adverting to the consequences of miscarriage ; and hence 
the reserve and caution which mark all such of mine as are 
trusted to common carriers, or doubtful bearers. 
</p><p>
The state of your politics is much as I expected. I fear 
some of your measures are more severe than wisdom or 
humanity will justify. Posterity will think dispassionately, 
and probably condemn, especially when informed that they 
were hastened lest the influence of resentment should be lost. 
</p><p>
My silence on a certain subject arose from reflecting that 
an explanation ought not to be on paper. The probability 
of it turns on an event not yet determined. If I discern 
right, there will be room. 
We shall be exceedingly happy to see you. I hope your 
visit will not be delayed longer than the mads may render 
necessary; and manage matters so as to stay here at least 
a month. I am, dear Robert,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
So uncertain has been the fate of letters during the 
course of this war, that I very seldom write one without 
adverting to the possibility and consequences of its miscarriage and publication. This precaution has on a late 
occasion given me much consolation. Two of my letters 
to Mrs. Jay fell into the enemy's hands at <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a> ; 
they contained nothing that would give me uneasiness if 
published. Prudential considerations of this kind have, 
since my arrival here, restrained me from writing several 
confidential letters to you ; and I should now be equally 
cautious had I not full confidence in the bearer of this, and 
under little apprehension of danger from accidents on the 
road. 
</p><p>
Congress has refused to accept your resignation. Twelve 
States were represented. New-England and Pennsylvania 
against you. The delegates of the latter are new men, and 
not free from the influence of the former. From New York south you have fast friends. Mr. ******' s disposition 
is at least questionable. Delaware w T as unrepresented. 
</p><p>
What is now to be done? You best can answer this 
question. Were I in your situation, I should not hesitate a 
moment to continue in the service. I have the best authority 
to assure you that the commander-in-chief wishes you to 
retain your commission. The propriety of your resignation is now out of question. Those laws of honour which 
might have required it arc satisfied : are you certain they 
do not demand a contrary conduct ? You have talents to 
render you conspicuous in the field ; and address to conciliate the affections of those who may now wish you ill. 
Both these circumstances are of worth to your family, and, 
independent of public considerations, argue forcibly for 
your joining the army. Gather laurels for the sake of your 
country and your children — you can leave them a sufficient 
share of property — leave them also the reputation of being 
descended from an incontestably great man — a man who, 
uninfluenced by the ingratitude of his country, was unremitted in his exertions to promote her happiness. You 
have hitherto been no stranger to these sentiments, and 
therefore I forbear to enlarge. Would it not do you honour 
to inform Congress that, while in their opinion your services ought not to be withheld from your country, neither 
the derangement of your private affairs, the severities you 
have experienced, nor regard to your health already impaired in their service, shall restrain you from devoting 
yourself to the execution of their commands ; but that 
whenever the situation of our affairs may cease to call you 
to the field, you hope they will permit you to retire and 
attend to the duties you owe your family. 
</p><p>
Should this be your resolution, would not the main army 
be your proper object ? there you may be best known, and 
there best acquire military influence. Consider: this campaign will in all human probability be decisive, and the 
last. Can you, therefore, employ six or eight months 
better. 
</p><p>
I will not apologize for the freedom with which I write, 
being persuaded that although our opinions may vary, you 
will consider this letter as some evidence of the sincerity 
with which I am

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the long and friendly letter of the 
14th inst. which I have had the pleasure of receiving from 
you. It was, for many reasons, grateful to me. I value 
the esteem and regard of the wise and virtuous ; and bad 
wished to know the particulars of transactions respecting 
which only vague and unsatisfactory reports had come to 
my knowledge. Delicacy forbade my breaking the subject 
to you when here. I was sure of your politeness, but not 
certain of more than a usual degree of confidence. The 
latter has now become manifest, and permit me to assure 
you it shall be mutual. The impression attempted to be 
made has not taken. It passed without a single remark. 
Your friends thought it merited nothing but silence and 
neglect. The same reason induced me to take no notice 
of it in my answer. 
</p><p>
I have perused the several papers with which you 
favoured me. The delicacy, candour, and temper diffused 
through your letters form a strong contrast to the evasions 
and design observable in some others. Gratitude ought to 
have attached a certain gentleman to the friend who raised 
him ; a spurious ambition, however, has, it seems, made 
him your enemy. This is not uncommon. To the dishonour of human nature, the history of mankind has many 
pages filled with similar instances ; and we have little reason to expect that the annals of the present or future times 
will present us with fewer characters of this class. On the 
contrary, there is reason to expect that they will multiply in 
the course of this revolution. Seasons of general heat, 
tumult, and fermentation favour the production and growth 
of some great virtues, and of many great and little vices. 
Which will predominate, is a question which events not 
yet produced nor now to be discerned can alone determine. 
What parties and factions will arise, to what objects be 
directed, what sacrifices they will require, and who will be 
the victims, are matters beyond the sphere of human prescience. New modes of government, not generally understood, nor in certain instances approved — want of moderation and information in the people — want of abilities and 
rectitude in some of their rulers — a wide field open for the 
operations of ambition — men raised from low degrees to 
high stations, and rendered giddy by elevation and the 
extent of their views — a revolution in private property 
and in national attachments — laws dictated by the spirit of 
the times, not the spirit of justice and liberal policy — latitude in principles as well as commerce — suspension of education — fluctuations in manners, and public counsels, and 
moral obligations — indifference to religion, &c. &c, are 
circumstances that portend evils which much prudence, 
vigour, and circumspection are necessary to prevent or 
control. To me, there appears reason to expect a long 
storm and difficult navigation. Calm repose and the sweets 
of undisturbed retirement appear more distant than a peace 
with Britain. It gives me pleasure, however, to reflect that 
the period is approaching when we shall become citizens of 
a better-ordered state ; and the spending a few troublesome 
years of our eternity in doing good to this and future generations is not to be avoided nor regretted. Things will 
come right, and these States will be great and flourishing. 
The dissolution of our government threw us into a political 
chaos. Time, wisdom, and perseverance will reduce it 
into form, and give it strength, order, and harmony. In 
this work you are, to speak in the style of one of your professions, a master-builder ; and God grant that you may 
long continue a free and accepted mason. 
</p><p>
Thus, my dear sir, I have indulged myself in thinking loud 
in your hearing ; it would be an Hibernicism to say in your 
sight, though in one sense true ; it is more than probable I 
shall frequently do the like. Your letter shall be my 
apology, and the pleasure resulting from the converse of 
those we esteem, the motive.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The questions contained in your favour of the — : — April 
instant are as imj he .manner of introducing them is delicate. 
</p><p>
While the maritime affairs of the continent continue 
under the direction of they will be exposed to 
</p><p>
all the con qu ;nc s of want of system, ittenl on, and 
knowledge. The marine commitl :e com; d ■ • gate 
</p><p>
from each State; it fluctuates; new members constantly 
coming in, and old ones going out ; three or four, indeed, 
have remained in it from the beginning ; and few members 
understand even the state of our naval affairs, or have 
time or inclination to attend to them. But why is not this 
system changed 1 It is, in my opinion, inconvenient to the 
family compact. The commercial committee was equally 
useless. A proposition was made to appoint a commercial 
agent for the States under certain regulations. Opposition 
was made. The ostensible objections were various. The 
true reason was its interfering with a certain commercial 
agent in Europe and his connexions. 
</p><p>
You will, if I am not greatly mistaken, find Mr. Gerard disposed to be open and communicative. He has acquired an 
extensive knowledge of our affairs ; I have no reason to 
believe he will use it to our prejudice. There is as much 
intrigue in this State-house as in the Vatican, but as little 
secrecy as in a boarding-school. It mortifies me on this occasion to reflect that the rules of Congress on the subject of 
secrecy, which are far too general, and perhaps for that 
reason more frequently violated, restrains me from saying 
twenty things to you which have ceased to be private. 
</p><p>
The state of our currency is really serious. When or 
by what means the progress of the depreciation will be 
prevented, is uncertain. The subject is delicate, but the 
conduct of some men really indicates at least great indifference about it. It will not be many days before measures 
having a great, though not immediate influence on this subject, will be either adopted or rejected. I shall then have 
an opportunity of being more particular. 
I am, my dear sir,

Dear Benson, 
</p><p>
When shall we again, by a cheerful fire, or under a shadytree, recapitulate our juvenile pursuits or pleasures, or look 
back on the extensive field of politics we once have trodden ? 
Our plans of life have, within these few years past, been 
strangely changed. Our country, I hope, will be the better 
for the alterations. How far we, individually, may be benefited, is more questionable. Personal considerations, however, must give way to public ones, and the consciousness 
of having done our duty to our country and posterity, must 
recompense us for all the evils we experience in their cause. 
</p><p>
I wrote to you from Martinico. I have been four months 
in this kingdom without receiving more than three letters 
from America, and those not very interesting, being of old 
dates and not particular. You are among those from whom 
I wish often to hear, as well because I am interested in 
what concerns yourself, as on account of the intelligence 
respecting the affairs of our State, which I hope you will 
sometimes favour me with. Write nothing, nevertheless, 
that you would wish to be entirely private ; your letters 
may be inspected before they reach me ; that practice being 
general in the post-offices of France and Spain. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself you sometimes visit your <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a> friends. 
I know they esteem you, and always derive pleasure from 
your company. What arrangements have born made in your official departments ? Are your taxes paid ? Do the 
people continue firm 1 A few more glorious exertions will 
give them peace, liberty, and safety. What says Vermont? 
</p><p>
Tell me how your mother and brothers do. Remember 
me to them, and my other friends. God bless you, my friend. 
</p><p>
I am sincerely yours, 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 11th July gave me much pleasure ; 
there is a degree of ease and cordiality in it, which, as a 
mere letter of business, it did not require. I am the more 
obliged to you for it. 
</p><p>
It is true that I might write to Congress very often, indeed 
by every vessel, and there arc many of them ; but how are 
my letters to get to the seaside ? By the post ? They 
would be all inspected, and many suppressed. There is 
scarce a man in any of the ports, except Mr. Harrison, at 
Cadiz, with whom I would trust them ; so that if under 
different covers I could get them there, the danger would 
not end. To write often, and write nothing material, would 
be useless ; and when you see my public letter by this opportunity, you will perceive that to be well understood I 
must write a great deal. I would throw stones, too. with 
all my heart, if I thought they would hit only the committee 
without injuring the members of it. Till now I have 
received but one letter from them, and that not worth s 
farthing, though it conveyed a draft for one hundred thousand pounds sterling on the bank of hope. One good 
private correspondent would be worth twenty standing 
committees, made of the wisest heads in America, for the 
purpose of intelligence. What with clever wives, or 
pleasant walks, or too tired, or too busy, or do you do it, 
very little is done, much postponed, and more neglected. 
</p><p>
If you, who are naturally industrious and love your 
country, would frequently take up your pen and your 
ciphers, and tell me how the wheel of politics runs, and 
what measures it is from time to time turning out, I should 
be better informed, and Congress better served. I now 
get more intelligence of your affairs from the French 
ambassador, than from all the members of Congress put 
together. 
</p><p>
I had written thus far when I received a letter from Mr. Le Couteux, at Cadiz, enclosing a letter of the lGth of 
September, written at St. Ildefonso from me to Congress. 
It had been enclosed in one to Mr. Harrison, and that again 
put under cover to Mr. Le Couteux, and under these two 
covers was put into the post-office. Now mark its fate. 
The director of the post-office at Cadiz showed it to Mr. Le Couteux, naked and stripped of its two covers, of which 
he made no mention. He said it came from Bayonne, but 
Le Couteux, knowing my handwriting, paid the postage 
and returned it to me. 
</p><p>
This is only one among the many instances of the fate 
to which my letters are subjected. To avoid it I must now 
be at the expense of sending Colonel Livingston to the seaside with my despatches. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir,

Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for your favour of the 21st April, 
which was delivered to me the 27th August. Knowledge 
is essential to the duration of liberty, and Pennsylvania is 
wise in making them both the objects of public care. I 
have read your oration with pleasure. The subject is a 
fine one, the field large, and you have interspersed it with 
useful remarks and entertaining reflections. I put it into 
the hands of the Count D'Estaing and the French ambassador. Thev both said civil things of it. 
</p><p>
The society* have done me much honour by placing me 
on the list of their members. I shall endeavour to evince 
the sense I have of it, bv now and then sending them whatever I may find here worth their attention. 
</p><p>
I congratulate you on the glorious spirit spreading from 
your city through America. Your bank is the subject of 
much conversation and encomium, and the patriotism of 
the ladies renders them very celebrated. Such marks of 
union and public spirit are worth a victory. To be respectable abroad, we must be respectable at home, and the 
best way to gain friends is to be formidable to our enemies. 
But you know these things as well as I do, and I am persuaded your endeavours will not be wanting to place our 
country in both these points of light. Dr. Foulke may 
rely on my omitting no opportunity of being useful to him ; 
we must take care of young Americans. Much depends 
on the rising generation, and no pains should be spared to 
render them equal to the task that devolves upon them. 
</p><p>
Be assured that it will give me pleasure to continue this 
correspondence, and that I am, sir, 
</p><p>

Dear Sir. 
</p><p>
The pleasure given me by your letter of the 2d instant, 
may more easily be conceived than expressed. I am greatly 
obliged by your attention to my embarrassments. In my 
last on that subject which you received, was a copy of my 
letter to Count De Vergennes, from which it appeared that 
the sum I should have occasion for would probably be considerable, and far exceeding 25,000 dollars. Bills to the 
amount of 100,000 dollars have arrived. A loan cannot be 
effected here. What the court will do is as yet uncertain, 
and will long continue so. I should have replied to your 
letter before, but as I daily expected to hear from Count 
De Vergennes, I waited, with a view of mentioning the 
import to you. The enclosed copy of a note 1 received 
from Count Montmorin, contains all the advices I have on 
that head. My situation continues unpleasant, and though 
my endeavours are not wanting to better it, future events 
are too uncertain to be relied upon. To be active, prudent, 
and patient, is in my power ; but whether I shall reap as 
w T ell as sow and water, God only knows. 
</p><p>
I have often been told of the former supplies, and asked 
how they were to be reimbursed. My answer has uniformly been, that I knew neither their amount nor terms, 
and that I wished to be furnished with an account of both, 
»x:e. &c. As yet I have not been able to obtain it. 
</p><p>
Some mistake must have given occasion to any of the 
bills drawn on me being returned without acceptance. 
The fact is, that though I often delayed (with the consent 
of the holders), yet I never refused to accept any of them. 
</p><p>
I have written several letters to Congress, requesting 
them to forbear drawing further bills till proper funds should 
be established for their payment. Mere contingent assurances, or flattering inferences drawn from flattering expressions, ought never to be considered as a sufficient foundation 
for serious measures. 
</p><p>
Cornwallis, it seems, has cropped some of Gates's laurels : 
and Mr. Laurens is in the Tower. European politicians 
will, I suppose, though often deceived in the same way, 
again think America on her knees in the dust. Had Ternay been supported, the campaign would have had a different termination. Much money and spirit has been wasted 
by this disappointment. Of the latter, indeed, we shall 
never be in want, and I should be happy if the like could 
be said of the former. The conduct of France towards us 
has been friendly ; and though I cannot forbear to think she 
has been too inattentive to this object, my gratitude towards 
her is not impaired by it. I regret it as a misfortune, not 
blame it as a designed omission. 
</p><p>
I wrote to you last week, and now enclose a duplicate 
of another letter. You may rely on my reimbursing you 
the advances on account of our salaries, out of the first 
remittances I receive. 
</p><p>
I have often congratulated my country and myself on 
your being at present in France. I once expected to have 
seen you there, and to have profited by the lessons which 
time and much experience have taught you. Miracles have 
ceased, and my constitution does not promise length of 
days, or I should probably desire you, when you ascend, to 
drop me your mantle. That you may long retain it is one 
of the prayers of 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have lately received a letter from Francis Child, a lad 
whom I had taken by the hand after his father's death, and 
put apprentice to Mr. Dunlap, your printer. He complains 
that Dunlap refuses to give him the clothes stipulated in the 
indentures, and requests that 1 will save him from nakedness. You will oblige ine by giving him twenty-five bard 
dollars, or tbe amount of it in paper. If you can conveniently discover how he behaves and is like to turn out, I 
beg you will inform me ; for, as bis father bad a warm and 
steady attachment to me, I feel myself interested in the 
welfare of this son, who it seems was his favourite. 
</p><p>
My friend, you arc not a little indebted to me on the 
score of letters. One only has reached me. I am content 
to go on writing two or three for one, but really you must 
let us hear sometimes of you and Mrs. Morris. There are 
some hearts which, like feathers, stick to every thing they 
touch, and quit each with equal case. Mine is not one of this 
kind ; it adheres to few, but it takes strong hold ; you must, 
therefore, write to me ; and if you would make your letter 
very agreeable, dwell on tbe objects you will find at or near 
the hills, and within your own walls. Mrs. Jay writes 
by this opportunity to Mrs. Morris, whom she loves and 
esteems for many reasons unnecessary to repeat to you. 
</p><p>
Should the following cipher reach you safe, we may afterward write with less reserve. Entick's Spelling Dictionary, 
printed in <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>, paged backwards. The last page in the 
book is numbered 468. Let this be page the first, and 
mark the first page (which is the titlepage) 468. Count the 
words from the top, distinguishing the columns by a [.] over 
the first figure for the first column, and a [.] over the second 
figure for the second column. For instance, the word 
absent is the fifth word in the first column of the 434th 
page, and is to be thus written : 5.434. 
</p><p>
Remember me to your friends, Mr. and Mrs. Mease, 
and your other usual guests near the hills. I wish I had a 
few such honest, open-hearted companions here. God bless 
you. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, very sincerely, your friend, 6cc.

Dear Benson, 
</p><p>
There seems to be a spell in the pens of my friends in 
New- York. Except Livingston, I have not had a line from 
either of them since I left America ; not even from either 
of my brothers, nor from you, who also are several letters 
in my debt. I have a favour to ask of you ; it is that you 
would make a visit to my father, and send me a minute 
account of his health, and that of the family. Make a half 
dozen copies of your letter, and send them either, to some 
friend at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, or to <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Robert Morris</a>, at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
to be forwarded in different vessels. Don't neglect to do 
me this friendly office. You can easily conceive how painful it is to be so long in ignorance and suspense, about the 
situation and welfare of persons so nenr and dear to me, as 
many of thosn are to whom I allude. Tell me also how 
your mother and brothers do ; and believe me to be, as I 
have long been, your

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I should have much wondered what could have detained 
my letter, mentioned in yours of 20th September last, so 
long from you, had not my correspondence been strangely 
interrupted ever since my arrival. 
</p><p>
Your Constitution gives me much satisfaction. It appears to me to be, upon the whole, wisely formed and well 
digested. I find that it describes your State as being in 
New-England, as well as in America. Perhaps it would 
be better if these distinctions were permitted to die away. 
</p><p>
Your predictions respecting the fate of Lord Cornwallis have, thank God! been verified. It is a glorious, joyful, 
and important event. Britain feels the force of that stroke, and other nations berrin to doubt less of the continuance of 
our independence. Further successes must prepare the 
way for peace; and I hope that victory will stimulate, 
instead of relaxing our exertions. 
</p><p>
Although myself and my family have most severely suffered by the continental money, I am resigned to its fate. 
Provided we preserve our liberty and independence, I shall 
be content. Under their auspices, in a fruitful country, and 
by patient industry, a competence may always be acquired, 
and I shall never cease to prefer a little with freedom, to 
opulence without it. 
</p><p>
Your account of the plenty which abounds in our country 
is very flattering, and ought to excite our gratitude to the 
Hand that gives it. While our governments tax wisely, 
reward merit, and punish offenders, we shall have little to 
fear. The public has been too much a prey to peculation. 
Economy and strict accounts ought to be, and continue, 
among the first objects of our attention. 
</p><p>
I have not heard any thing for a long time respecting 
our disputed lines. In my opinion, few things demand more 
immediate care than this subject; and I differ from those 
who think that such matters had better be postponed till 
after the war. At present, a sense of common danger 
guaranties our union. We have neither time nor inclination to dispute among ourselves. Peace will give us leisure, and leisure often finds improper occasions for employment. I most sincerely wish that no disputes may survive 
the war ; and that on the return of peace, we may congratulate each other on our deliverance and prospects of 
uninterrupted felicity, without finding ourselves exposed to 
differences and litigations, which never fail to make impressions injurious to that cordiality and confidence which both 
our interest and our duty call upon us to cultivate and 
,eherish. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Jay charges me to present her compliments to you. 
I am, dear sir, with great and sincere esteem,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your favour of the 15th ult., with the packets mentioned 
in it, arrived in good order. I regret your long silence, 
though I am strongly inclined to rejoice in the cause of it : 
a lit of the gout, it is said, often prolongs life. 
</p><p>
Affairs here begin to wear a better aspect. I am promised 3,000,000 rials, that is, 150,000 dollars, which, though 
inadequate to the demands upon me, is still a great consolation, especially as men who are at the pains of planting 
and watering trees, seldom let them perish for want of a 
few drops extraordinary. 
</p><p>
I scarcely know how to desire you to make further advances on account of our salary, four months of which is 
now due, and yet I find myself under a necessity of doing 
it. My expenses here, notwithstanding the most rigid 
economy, are very great. 
</p><p>
Since writing the above, I have had the pleasure of receiving yours of the 27th January, and sincerely congratulate you on your recovery. The amount of my bill 
on you shall, agreeable to your request, be considered as 
part of the 25,000 dollars. Your reckoning, as to our 
salaries, corresponds with mine, though we have been 
losers by the exchange. 
</p><p>
As to the residue of the 25,000 dollars, my drafts shall 
be entirely regulated by my necessities, and I shall be 
happy if they permit me to leave a considerable proportion 
of that sum in your hands. I shall be constrained, however, 
to call for a part of that sum shortly ; but whether by a bill, 
or by means of the marquis,* is uncertain. As to that 
gentleman's complaint of my reserve towards him, I could 
make many remarks, which, though proper for your perusal, 
ought not to go further. 
</p><p>
A few days after my arrival here, a person, whom I was 
told was the marquis, was introduced to me. He said he 
came to pay me a visit by order of Mr. Grand. I did not 
then know I was indebted to that gentleman for a letter of 
recommendation to the marquis, it not having come to my 
hands. This singularity struck me, though I appeared not 
to observe it. The civilities usual on such occasions 
passed between us, and at parting the marquis gave me a 
general invitation to dine with him whenever I should find 
it convenient. I returned his visit, but as general invitations from strangers pass with us for mere matters of compliment, I declined doing myself the honour of dining with 
him. Interchanges of visits were continued, and the general invitation to dine once or twice repeated. In this line 
my connexion with the marquis remained, until I received 
the offer of the king's responsibility for a loan, &c. Several 
reasons induced me to think it expedient to consult the 
marquis as to the manner of making this offer useful to us. 
I waited upon him for that purpose. He told me he could 
not intermeddle in these affairs without instructions from the 
court; but was nevertheless very civil, and expressed a 
desire of doing me services, &c. As he declined entering 
into particulars, I did not press it ; nor had my ideas of 
his importance risen so high as to reconcile me to the extraordinary and unnecessary measure of applying to the 
court for the instructions in question. I did not, however, 
let him know my sentiments or intentions on the subject. 
It seems he had heard of Mr. Grand having been desired 
by you to make inquiries for money for me, and he advised me to write to him on the subject, which I accordingly did.In his answer of the 21st October, he says, "I am very 
unhappy to hear you are not benefited on the spot by the 
facility tendered to you by the court of Spain, so much 
more so that the nature of circumstances here does not 
admit of the least hope of success. Too many attempts, 
all vainless, have already been made for the good of your 
credit ; adding any more to the numberwould be destructive 
to it entirely, at this particular juncture chiefly when our 
government is about raising a sum of money much more 
enticing and advantageous in its conditions. This perplexing situation suggested me an idea I communicated to Dr. 
Franklin," &c. 
</p><p>
" Meanwhile it is highly important to avail yourself of the 
favourable disposition of the court of Spain, and get it to 
authorize and charge the marquis to help you in your 
finance business. He writes me that without orders he 
cannot take it upon himself. It will be better for your excellency not to consult him before making the application 
to government," &c. 
</p><p>
You, my good friend, have seen and thought too much 
of men and things to need any of my remarks on this 
letter. I replied to it on the 1st November as follows : 
</p><p>
" Sir, 
</p><p>
" I have had the honour of receiving your letter of the 
21st October last. I had flattered myself that a loan on 
reasonable terms and adequate security might have been 
effected for the United States in France ; but as that court 
is raising money on conditions more advantageous and 
agreeable, I am not surprised at our having little prospect 
of success. 
</p><p>
" The hint you gave <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a> was a good one, and I 
hopo will be productive of good consequences. 
</p><p>
"Your obliging advice relative to the marquis, shall meet 
with all the attention due to its importance ; and if that 
measure should, on further consideration, appear expedient, 
it shall be pursued in the manner you recommend. 
</p><p>
The marquis repeating his general invitation about this 
time, I dined with him. He received and entertained me 
very politely. We parted, to appearances, pleased with 
each other ; but he has not been at my house since, though 
a great many visits in my debt. 
</p><p>
Ever since my arrival, I have been particularly cautious 
to avoid offending any person of any rank ; to endeavour to 
please all, without becoming the property or sycophant of 
any. My disagreeable situation was not unknown to him, 
but the inferences he drew from it proved fallacious. I 
never find myself less disposed to humility, or improper 
compliances, than when fortune frowns. I have uniformly 
been very civil, though not confidential, to the marquis, nor 
has any thing harsh ever passed between us. He is a man 
of business, abilities, and observation, and (what is of much 
importance here) of money. He keeps the most, and 
indeed only, hospitable house here, and persons of the first 
rank and fashion are found at his table. His consequence 
at court is unequal to his desires, and I think to his capacity 
of being useful. In a word, he has a good share of sagacity, 
ambition, and pride. I think it probable that we shall yet 
be on more familiar terms ; for though I will never court, I 
shall with pleasure cultivate his acquaintance. 
</p><p>
The Count de Montmorin continues very friendly. I 
believe him to be an able minister, and well attached to 
our cause. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Jay desires me to make her compliments to you.

Dear Benson, 
</p><p>
Either some very singular fatality must have attended 
the letters of my New-York friends to me, or they have 
given mc abundant reason to complain of them as correspondents ; not one letter to me, dated in our State, has 
reached me since I left America. 
</p><p>
I have written to you from Martinico, from Cadiz, and 
from this place ; some of these letters, I have reason to think, 
arrived safe, though several others have probably miscarried. 
Your governor is largely in my debt, and so is <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a>, whom I always thought a very punctual correspondent. How am I to account for this ? I cannot persuade myself that neglect is among the causes. Business 
seldom continues a good excuse for a year together, and 
indolence, often a real, is never an admissible one. 
</p><p>
The vulgar proverb, out of sight, out of mind, always 
appeared to me in the light of a vulgar error, when applied 
to old friends and companions. I hope I have not been 
mistaken, especially as the contrary of that proposition is 
true with respect to myself. I never loved or admired 
America so much as since I left it, and my attachment to 
my friends in it seems to have increased, in proportion as 
distance of time and place separated me from them. The 
remark that we seldom estimate blessings justly till we are 
about to lose them for a time, or altogether, is, I believe, 
frequently true, and perhaps that circumstance has tightened 
the cords which bind me to my friends and country. I 
could carry your recollection back to days that are past,

pleasures, in which we had been partakers. These shades 
speak a language that I hope your heart understands as

long been, and still am,

There has long, my dear sir, been something about my 
heart which urged me to write to you ; but I thought it 
selfish to diminish your few leisure moments by an additional correspondent, especially as your punctuality and 
attention would probably have led you to consult my wishes 
rather than your own convenience. The time, I hope, will 
come, when the return of tranquillity will give me an opp< >rtunity of conversing with you on several interesting subjects. 
I have, however, concluded to allow myself the pleasure of 
writing you a few lines now and then. Indeed, I ought to 
have recollected, that while I was giving myself credit in 
my own mind for self-denial, you might have been charging 
me in yours for inattention ; and, therefore, that it might 
have been more prudent, and perhaps not less generous, to 
have troubled you with letters, than with inducements to 
suspect that my heart, like a feather, would, with equal ease, 
stick to, or quit any man on whom the breath of whim or 
interest might blow it on or off. 
</p><p>
The firmness and delicacy observed in the case of Major 
Andre, is exceedingly admired here. I am happy Colonel 
Beverley did not succeed in renewing his acquaintance with 
you. You have really been very fortunate in having so 
long resisted the attacks of open enemies, and escaped the 
snares of secret ones. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty of sending you a cask of Packaretti, the 
favourite wine of our late friend, Don Juan, whose death I 
much lament. His place will, I believe, be soon filled by a 
gentleman who will probably deliver you a letter of introduction from me. 
</p><p>
Mr. Harrison, a very worthy kinsman of your secretary, is 
shipping from Cadiz the clothing taken by Admiral Cordova, 
and presented by France and Spain to Congress. I have 
desired him to send you invoices of each parcel. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Jay has more than usual health, and seems as much 
interested in your health and safety, as if you was her own 
father, as well as that of her country. Be pleased to present 
our best wishes to Mrs. Washington ; and when you write 
to your honest friend, Colonel Harrison, remember me to 
him. I hope Arnold has not spoiled his mill-dam. God bless you, my dear sir.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding my repeated and earnest applications to the Count de Florida Blanca, I have as yet been able to 
obtain only $34,880 of the <a href='/results.php?year=8150'>8150</a>,000 expressly promised 
me in December last. He has, on the contrary, assured 
me that this promise cannot be complied with in less than 
six months. It therefore became necessary to communicate my embarrassments to the ambassador of France, and 
to request his friendly aid and interposition. You will perceive, by the enclosed account, that the bills I have accepted 
and what still remain to be paid (exclusive of those at two 
months' sight, for the payment of which you authorized me 
to draw upon you) amount to $231,303; of which 
$89,083 will be payable this month,

</p><p>
The ambassador was very sensible of the pernicious 
consequences which would follow a protest of these bills, 
and, I must do him the justice to say, interested himself 
warmly in endeavouring to extricate me from that necessity. 
He has had different conferences with the Count D. F. B. on 
the subject, and yesterday he promised the ambassador positively to pay the $89,083 which will be due in April, in the 
course of six months, in six equal payments, reckoning 
from next May ; but as this money still left me without 
relief as to the April bill, he engaged the Marquis d'Yranda 
to advance the sums necessary to pay them, and which I 
shall accordingly receive from him. Thus, my dear sir. I 
have been, as it were, reprieved by the kind offices of the 
French ambassador, from protesting any of the bills due 
this month ; but every ensuing month will bring with it new 
dangers and solicitudes, and particularly the month of May, 
in the course of which I shall be called upon for no less 
than 896,288. I am in a cruel situation, and without the 
least expectation of succour except from France. I therefore think it necessary to inform you of the delicate state 
of our affairs here by express, and to entreat you to use 
your utmost endeavours to provide me, by his return, with 
funds adequate to the bills accepted, and wdiich at present 
amount to $142,220, without including either those which 
may yet arrive, or the $89,083 due this month, and for the 
payment of which I expect to reimburse the Marquis 
d'Yranda with the money promised by the minister in the 
monthly payment before mentioned. 
</p><p>
The Marquis d'Yranda, whom I saw yesterday at the 
French ambassador's, has further agreed, at the ambassador's request, to furnish me with the further sum of $142,220 
as I shall have occasion for it, provided Mr. Grand will 
accept his drafts to that amount. It is therefore of the last 
importance that arrangements for this purpose be immediately taken with that gentleman, and that I receive, by 
the return of the express, his order on the marquis to furnish me at least with the sum of <a href='/results.php?year=8142'>8142</a>,220 ; without which 
it will be impossible for me to pay these bills. 
</p><p>
The ambassador will also write by this courier, and I 
have little doubt but that your court will generously interpose on this, as they have on several other occasions, to 
prevent events prejudicial to America in particular, and the 
common cause in general. I am also constrained to add, 
that our situation here is daily becoming more disagreeable 
from the want of our salaries. To be obliged to contract 
debts and live on credit is terrible. I have not, to this day, 
received a shilling from America ; and we should indeed 
have been greatly distressed, had it not been for your good 
offices. Endeavour, I beseech you, to provide us with supplies on this account, and deliver me, if possible, from the 
many disagreeable sensations which such a variety of unpleasant circumstances naturally creates. Remember that 
new bills are still arriving. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to communicate this letter to Mr. Laurens, 
who, I am persuaded, will cheerfully afford you all the aid 
in his power. 
</p><p>
I have directed the courier to wait your orders, and then 
return without further delay. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your friend and humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>. 
</p><p>
P.S. You will perceive, from the enclosed account, that 
I shall be under the necessity of drawing upon you for ten 
or twelve thousand dollars, on account of the twenty-five 
thousand, before it will be possible to hear from you on the 
subject.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On the 30th January last, I had the pleasure of receiving vour very acceptable letter of the 12th October, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>. 
The able manner in which it treats the important subject of 
American finances induced me to give that part of it to the 
minister, and to send a copy of the same extract to Dr. 
Franklin, who, in his answer, says — " I thank you for communicating to me the letter of the secretary of Congress on 
our finances. It gives light which I had not before, and 
may be useful here." 
</p><p>
I wish in my heart that you was not only secretary of 
Congress, but secretary also for foreign affairs. I should 
then have better sources of intelligence than gazettes and 
reports. 
</p><p>
My public letter contains a state of our affairs here. I 
flatter myself that Congress will never again attempt to 
form an alliance on principles of equality in forma pauperis. 
</p><p>
Before their ingenious letter on our right to the Mississippi arrived, it was known in Europe ; and the subject of 
my last instructions on that head was no secret here before 
they reached this side of the ocean. I would tell vou mure, 
had I now time to write in ciphers ; but the gentleman who 
is to carry these despatches is waiting for them. 
</p><p>
The want of a regular and safe communication between 
Congress and their foreign ministers gives occasion to 
various inconveniences. Every letter known or suspected 
to be for or from me, that gets into the post-offices, is 
opened, often kept back for a while, and, to my certain 
knowledge, sometimes suppressed entirely. 
</p><p>
Hence it happens that Congress receives from me fewer 
letters than I could wish, or than their affairs may demand. 
The expense of private couriers is intolerable, nor can many 
in that character be found who merit confidence. 
</p><p>
The unseasonable arrival of bills, without being preceded 
by funds, and the train of perplexing consequences resulting 
from that and other causes not in my power to prevent, 
have given me some anxious hours, and often rendered my 
situation uneasy. 
It is my business, however, to reflect, that pleasure was 
not the object for which I came here, and that obstacles 
should rather excite than repress perseverance. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to present Mrs. Jay's and my compliments 
to Mrs. Thompson, and believe me to be with sincere 
regard and esteem, 
</p><p>

Sir, 
</p><p>
So many letters both for and from me miscarry, that I 
take this opportunity of informing you, that I have had the 
pleasure of writing to you by the way of Cadiz, and that I 
consider myself much obliged by your favour of the 27th 
Feb. last, which did not come to my hands till long after it. 
must have arrived here. The intelligence communicated 
by it was no less welcome than interesting. We wait with 
impatience for further information respecting the military 
operations in the southern States. Lord Cornwallis's expedition bears some marks of rashness, and I cannot but 
expect he will have some reason to repent it. I think his 
temper and measures well calculated to enrage and discipline the southern militia ; if so, his victories will render 
his enemies more numerous and formidable than ever. The 
ratification of the confederation, and the firm establishment 
of civil government in the different states, are circumstances 
very friendly to the American cause, and should be viewed 
by our enemies as insurmountable obstacles to our again 
becoming their subjects. Such, however, is their infatuation and their obstinacy, that there appears very little reason to flatter ourselves with a speedy peace, unless this 
campaign should produce events greatly to their prejudice. 
I hope, therefore, that our countrymen will not suffer themselves to be amused with such delusive expectations, but on 
the contrary will persevere vigorously and systematically 
in preparing to prosecute the war. 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Many weeks have elapsed since I have been favoured 
with an}- letters from you. I have rec< ived a letter from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a>, dated at sea, and covering the one herewith enclosed for you. A vessel has arrived at Bilboa, in 
twenty-four days from Salem. I received by her some 
family letters, which came from Bilboa under cover to a 
gentleman here. She brought for me a large packet, which 
was put into the post-office, and ought to have come to 
hand a week ago. I have inquired for it, but in vain. 
This is not an uncommon case, and shows how necessary 
it is that Congress should take some other means for conveying intelligence to and from their ministers than the 
European post-offices. Be pleased to make my compliments to your grandson, and remind him that he is three 
letters in my debt. 
</p><p>
You will also find herewith enclosed a copy of a letter I 
have received from Silas Talbot, a prisoner at <a href='/results.php?city=plymouth' rel='city'>Plymouth</a>, 
requesting aid. 
</p><p>
This gentleman gives a true description of himself. He 
has on various occasions acted like a very brave and enterprising officer, and the journals of Congress contain 
ample evidence of it. I sincerely lament his situation, and 
regret that my own does not put it in my power to afford 
him relief. The far greater part of the money which the 
public demands require here, I draw from you. The 
amount of the bills drawn upon me by Congress far exceeds that of the funds prepared for their payment, and 
the debts already incurred on account of distressed American seamen still remain unpaid. It would not be delicate 
in me to advance money to Colonel Talbot, and then request the favour of you to replace it, especially as his 
situation places him more immediately under your care 
than mine. All that I can therefore do with propriety is 
to make you acquainted with his case. He has served his 
country zealously, and has a right to her care ; gratitude 
as well as policy dictates it. I fear too little attention has 
in general been paid to our captive seamen. I often hear 
of many entering into the enemy's service for want of 
bread, and for ill treatment not retaliated ; even those who 
have had the good fortune and address to escape, are frequently obliged, in seeking opportunities to return home, to 
wander about from place to place, friendless, penniless, 
ignorant of the language of the strangers through whose 
Land they pass, making known their wants only by the voice 
of distress, and subsisting on the wretched husks cast to 
them by the frugal hand of charity. Nor is this all: 
although their misfortunes, on finding American vessels 
bound home, ought to recommend them to their brethren, 
yet it too often happens that masters of American vessels 
inhumanly refuse (unless paid passage-money) to carry 
home these unfortunate people, though offering to do duty 
without wages as sailors during the voyage.

Sir, 
</p><p>
Although I have not had the pleasure of your acquaintance, I am not a stranger to your merit. 
</p><p>
On receiving your favour of the 11th ult., I sent a copy 
of it to his excellency <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a>, and warmly recommended your case to his attention. I am persuaded he will 
do all in his power for your relief, and that the distinguished prisoner of war in England. 
</p><p>
manner in which you have served our country, will 
always be considered as giving you a title to her care and 
protection. 
</p><p>
Not being authorized by Congress to provide for American prisoners in England, I could not justify undertaking it, 
and therefore referred your application to <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a>, 
within whose department that business appears to me 
to fall. 
</p><p>
I shall always be ready as an individual to contribute to 
the relief of my distressed countrymen, and should now 
give you proof of it ; but as your case and that of your 
fellow-prisoners ought to be, and probably are provided for 
by the public, I think assistance should there be asked and 
denied, before it can become the duty of private benevolence to supply public omissions. 
</p><p>
If the application to <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a> should be fruitless, I 
shall then consider myself bound, as a good American, to 
contribute towards the relief of a fellow-citizen, who has 
so nobly fought in the cause of our country ; and I shall in 
that case desire Mr. Williams, at Nantz, who forwarded 
your letter to me, to advance you fifty dollars on my private 
account ; which sum you will repay to me whenever you 
may be in circumstances to do it, for should misfortunes 
delay or prevent your being in that situation, it would be 
more agreeable to me to advance you a farther sum, than 
to demand the repayment of this. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, with real esteem,

My dear Brother, 
</p><p>
We have heard (though not from you) that a number of 
armed robbers have paid you a visit, and taken from the 
family their money, plate, &c. ; it is also said that they 
behaved towards our father, Peter, and Nancy, with more 
decency and respect than people of that class generally 
observe. I am very sensible of the distress which this 
misfortune must have occasioned ; my having, however, in 
two of my former letters, which I hope have arrived safe, 
desired you to draw upon me for one hundred pounds sterling, in two sets of bills of fifty pounds each, gives me 
much consolation ; should this not be adequate to your exigences, you may draw upon me for thirty pounds sterling 
more. While I have any thing, a share of it shall be 
appropriated to the wants of the family. I thank God that 
by means of economy, I shall be able to afford them some 
assistance from time to time, and in some measure mitigate 
the calamities brought upon them by the war, and the transmutation of their gold into paper. 
</p><p>
On the 25th of June last, Mr. Harrison, at Cadiz, shipped 
at my request, and on my account and risk, by the Black 
Prince, Captain John Robertson, bound from thence for 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, one bale marked I. Jay, to be delivered to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Robert Morris</a>, and containing 67 f Spanish yards of 
coarse cloth, and 70 1 yards of baize for lining. 
</p><p>
If this arrives safe, it will help to keep your servants 
warm next winter. A Spanish yard is somewhat less than 
an English one. Miss Katy Livingston writes me, that 
one little parcel of salt I sent you, was then safe in <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Morris</a>'s custody, and that she had by letter informed you 
of it. I have since sent another parcel of a dozen or fifteen bushels. I think you would do well to write to <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Morris</a> now and then, and enclose to him such of your 
letters for me as you may intend to go by vessels from 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
On considering the state of the family, I am really at a 
loss to see how the number of it can be considerably 
reduced. As to the old servants, who have expended 
their strength and youth for the family, they ought and 
must be taken good care of, while we have the means 
of doing it; common justice, and I may say gratitude, demands it. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole I believe it will be best, considering the 
age, infirmities, and various afflictions of our good old 
lather, not to press him upon these, nor indeed any other 
points that may not be very important, but by leaving his 
mind as much as possible undisturbed, and endeavouring 
daily to soothe and quirt his cares, to render the evening of 
his days as calm and composed as the complication of perplexities which surround him will permit. 
</p><p>
I am told Peggy behaved like a Roman matron, and in 
her conduct towards the robbers showed great firmness 
and presence of mind. Present to her my commendations 
on the occasion. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself that my father's fortitude did not forsake 
him, and therefore, that though he lost money, he did not 
lose health by those rude visiters. Your letter made me 
happy by assuring me that his strength continued as when 
I left him. God grant that I may find it the same on my 
return. I really regret Nancy's* ill-health ; it should be 
better if my prayers and wishes could avail. You must 
endeavour to keep up each others spirits, and oppose misfortunes with manly firmness and cheerful resignation. 
</p><p>
We are all well. Remember us affectionately to all the 
family. 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Several letters I have received from Jersey and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> mention your having been robbed in April last by 
a number of armed men. It is said, they behaved with 
uncommon respect to you, and humanity towards Peter and 
Nancy. If this be true, they deserve credit for the manner 
in which they executed their purposes. The loss sustained 
on that occasion must have been the more severely felt, as 
the situation of the country, and the injuries you had suffered from the enemy, and the depreciation of the paper 
money, rendered it difficult for you to repair it. I thank 
God, however, that you lost nothing but property — your 
lives were spared. I beseech you not to permit an improper degree of delicacy to prevent your deriving such 
succours from me as may from time to time be convenient. 
I assure you, the reflection that my absence may be the 
means of rendering the situation of the family less distressing, makes me more reconciled to it than I otherwise 
should be. You have denied yourself much for the sake of 
your children ; and I am much mistaken if some of them 
have not inherited dispositions somewhat similar to those 
of their parents. Had you been less attentive to my education, I should not have been as and where I am. Economy 
will enable me to give you aid, for though I shall spare no 
expense here which my situation may require, yet a tax 
upon avoidable pleasures, amusements, and luxuries, will 
produce a little fund that may and shall be useful to you. 
In my letter to Frederick I have been more explicit on this 
subject. My love to all the family.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Among other letters brought by Major Franks, I had the 
pleasure of receiving one from you, dated in July last. 
From the few of mine that have reached you, it appears 
they have been very unfortunate, and with many others, 
have probably perished in the ocean. 
</p><p>
I am therefore to repeat my congratulations on the happiness you derive from the most delicate of all connexions 
with one of the most lovely of her sex. As I am always 
pleased to find those happy who I think deserve to be so, it 
gave me very sensible satisfaction to hear that you had 
both made so judicious a choice, notwithstanding the vi ii 
which that sweet fascinating passion often draws over our 
eyes and understanding. Be pleased to present my compliments and best wishes to Mrs. Bingham, and to add and 
accept those of Mrs. Jay. who never speaks of Martinico 
without expressing how much we are indebted to you for 
the agreeable manner in which we passed the time we 
staid there. 
</p><p>
Your representation of the state of our affairs is flattering, and affords reason to hope that the enemy will soon 
cease to deceive themselves and others by groundless expectations of conquest. 
</p><p>
Peace and the negotiations for it are the prevailing topics 
of conversation here, and perhaps in America also. I 
hope, however, that our countrymen will not suffer themselves to be too much influenced by prospects, which may 
prove no less delusive than they are pleasing. To prepare 
vigorously for war is the only sure way of preparing for a 
speedy and valuable peace. 
</p><p>
The Duke de Crillon is in possession of every part of 
Minorca, except Fort St. Philip, which, unless pressed by 
want of provisions or ammunition, will not, I suspect, soon 
or easilv change masters. 
</p><p>
I should mention some other public intelligence ; but 
before this letter can possibly come to your hands, as Major 
Franks will go from hence to Paris, it will cease to be new 
in America. 
</p><p>
It is natural for you to expect that my letters should now and then contain some traits of this country, its manners, government, and principal characters. With respect 
to the three first, I make it a rule to be perfectly silent in 
all my letters. The latter is a very delicate subject, and 
men should be well acquainted with a character before 
they attempt to describe it. Much injustice is often done 
by taking reports as facts, and forming opinions of men 
from the suggestions which may arise from envy or interested partialities. Though not very old, I have lived too 
long to credit all I hear ; and having been deceived by fair 
as well as unpromising appearances, they have ceased to 
decide my judgment of men. 
</p><p>
Whenever you write to me, which I hope will be often, 
recollect that your letters will, in nine instances out of ten, 
be inspected before they reach me ; write nothing, therefore, 
that you would wish concealed. But as this necessary 
caution may sometimes restrain you from communicating 
what you may think interesting for me to know, I cannot 
omit this opportunity of giving you a cipher, viz. Entick's 
New Spelling Dictionary, printed at London in <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>, which 
you will easily find at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> ; I bought mine at 
Bell's book-store. Add twenty to the number of the page, 
and ten to that of the word you use. Distinguish the first 
column by a dot over the first figure, and the second 
column by a dot over the second figure. For instance, the 
word duration is the first word in the first column of the 
139th page, and must be thus written, 159 11. Again, the 
word beauty is the tenth word in the second column of the 
60th page, and must be thus written, 80 20. But as it may 
often happen that you may want to write names or words 
which you will not find in the dictionary, use the following 
alphabet in such cases : 
</p><p>
a b c d e f g h i j k 1 m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 
n m 1 k i h f i e d c b a 1 y v x t u r p w s z o y 
The design of this alphabet is obvious ; use n for a, m 
for b, &c. 
</p><p>
I must now remark that you will have it in your power 
to give me advices of such matters as, though often interesting, I am seldom favoured with by any of my correspondents. I mean the state of parties, the views of leading individuals, and such intelligence respecting our friends 
and others, as though I might wish to know, ought not to 
be public, and can only be safely communicated in cipher. 
</p><p>
Send your letters for me, under cover, to His Excellency 
the Count de Montmorin, the Ambassador of His Most 
Christian Majesty at this court. 
</p><p>
I fear you will find a correspondence of this kind a little 
troublesome, but I know your industry, talents, and disposition to oblige, and therefore, though my letters mav not 
always afford an adequate compensation, I flatter myself 
you will not decline it, especially as you may be assured of 
the utmost prudence and secrecy on my part. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to remember us to all our friends in your 
circle. With sincere regard and attachment, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I thank you sincerely for your very friendly letter of the 
21st October last, which I had the pleasure of receiving on 
the 7th inst. I rejoice most cordially with you and every 
other good American, in the important event you communicate, and to which you had both the honour and the satisfaction of essentially contributing. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>General Washington</a> has favoured me with copies of the 
articles of capitulation, and returns of the prisoners, &c. It 
gives me very sensible pleasure to find that he commanded 
in person on this glorious occasion, and had the satisfaction 
of bringing deliverance to his native, and consequently, 
favourite part of America. If <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> shall be pleased 
to lead him, with safety and success, through all the duties 
of his station, and carry him home with the blessings of all 
America on his head, I think he will exhibit to the world 
the most singular instance of virtue, greatness, and good 
fortune united, which the history of mankind has hitherto 
recorded. 
</p><p>
The harmony subsisting between the French troops and 
ours, is an agreeable, as well as an important circumstance, 
and I am glad that the Marquis De La Fayette had an opportunity of cutting some sprigs of laurel on one of the enemy's 
redoubts. He has given strong proofs of attachment to our 
cause and country, and as military glory seems to be his 
mistress, he has my .best wishes that she maybe as constant to him as he has been to us. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> has deservedly acquired great reputation. He has nobly surmounted a variety of difficulties, 
and his country has fortunately found resources in his 
talents and perseverance, which the peculiar situation of 
the southern States rendered no less seasonable than important. 
</p><p>
This campaign ends gloriously for us. How far the 
British counsels may be changed by these events, is as yet 
uncertain. I am much inclined to think that another campaign will precede a general peace. In my opinion, our 
country would do well to continue making the most vigorous efforts to render peace more essential to her enemies 
than herself. 
</p><p>
It would give me pleasure to transmit to you some interesting advices from this quarter of the world. The seiges 
of Gibraltar and Fort St. Philip continue. When they will 
be terminated, is impossible to divine. The Dutch are 
praying for peace, and neglecting the means necessary to 
obtain a proper one. The people do not appear to want 
spirit, but their government and their rulers subject them to 
numberless embarrassments. 
</p><p>
France is full of joy and ardour, and will, I believe, do 
her best endeavours to make the next campaign active and 
brilliant. 
</p><p>
The emperor is regulating the internal police of his dominions, encouraging commerce, and extending toleration, 
without suffering himself to be incommoded by ecclesiastical privileges or immunities. He seems to be seriously 
preparing to be great and formidable. He undoubtedly 
possesses the means of power, and it is said, has talents to 
use them to advantage.

I am, dear sir,

Dear Sir,

My last to you was written on the 16th November, 
since which I have not had the pleasure of hearing from 
you. 
</p><p>
I congratulate you on the successful issue of the last 
campaign, to the brilliancy of which the late surrender of 
Fort St. Philip, at Mahon, has much contributed.

Mr. Benson writes me that your judges are industriously 
serving their country, but that their country had not, as yet, 
made an adequate provision for them. This is bad policy, 
and poverty cannot excuse it. The bench is at present 
well filled; but it should be remembered, that although we 
are told that Justice should be blind, vet there are no 
proverbs which declare that she ought also to be hungry. 
Assure these gentlemen of my esteem ; and believe me to

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Some of my letters to you have, I find, miscarried by the 
capture of the vessels that were carrying them : and there 
is reason to suspect that two others were stopped here, as 
the letters enclosing them did not reach the persons at the 
seaports to whom they were directed. 
</p><p>
I have heretofore mentioned the receipt of the picture 
you was so kind as to send me, by Mr. Ridley, and the 
arrival of your sons. I don't know the fate of that letter, 
and that uncertainty induces me to repeat my thanks for 
the one, and my congratulations on the other. The estimation in which I hold your friendship, and the marks I have 
received of it, interest me in every thing which concerns 
you and yours, and be assured that no opportunity of giving 
higher proofs of it shall be omitted. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Jay's time is much employed in nursing and amusing herself w T ith her little girl. She is writing to Mrs. 
Morris. We are cheerful, and not unhappy, though distant 
from our friends, and deprived of the pleasures which result from that free and unreserved conversation which can 
only be indulged in the company of safe companions, or in 
a country like ours. 
</p><p>
We remove next week to Aranjuez, where I expect again 
to spend some agreeable weeks. It is a charming place, 
containing a tract of several miles in circumference, and 
divided into gardens, meadows, parks, cultivated grounds, 
and wilds, full of fine trees, fine roads, and fine walks, and 
watered by a slow winding river, which, if more clear, would 
be very beautiful. But still, my friend, it is not America. 
A genius of a different character from that which presides 
at your hills and gardens reigns over these. Soldiers, with 
fixed bayonets, present themselves at various stations in 
these peaceful retreats; and though none but inoffensive citizens are near, yet horsemen with drawn swords, guarding one or other of the royal family in their little excursions 
to take the air daily, renew and impress ideas of subjection. 
Power unlimited, and distrust misplaced, thus exacting 
homage and imposing awe, occasion uneasy reflections, and 
alloy the pleasing sensations which nature, smiling in such 
delightful scenes, never fails to excite. Were I a Spaniard, 
these decorated seats would appear to me like the temporary enchantments of some despotic magician, who, by reextending his wand, could at pleasure command them to 
vanish, and be succeeded by galleys and prisons. 
</p><p>
Nothing is more true, than that all things figure by comparison. This elegant seat being surrounded by exclusive 
wastes, appears like a blessed and fortunate island in a 
dreary ocean. The contrast heightens its charms, and 
every traveller arrives with a mind predisposed to admire 
and enjoy them ; but as the first impression wears away, 
and he begins to recollect the more happy, though less 
magnificent abodes in his own country, the attractions and 
allurements of this insensibly diminish. I have more than 
once experienced this, and though not difficult to please or 
be contented, vet I confess that I find little here that resembles, and nothing that can compensate for the free air, the 
free conversation, the equal liberty, and the other numerous 
blessings which God and nature, and laws of our making, 
have given and secured to our happier country. I would 
not be understood to insinuate, that good society and agreeable companions are wanting here. They may, perhaps, 
abound more in some other parts of the world, but they are 
also to be found here, though an unsocial kind of policy 
requires unceasing attention to the most austere rules of 
caution and prudence. The little that I have seen and 
observed of this people, induces me to think that (except 
the generality of those who compose the highest and lowest 
orders), they possess many qualities which are praiseworthy ; and that two or three long and wise reigns would 
make them a very powerful, and an amiable nation. But 
as I have not had sufficient opportunities of mixing with, 
and personally knowing many of them, time and further 
information may either confirm or alter this opinion. The 
evident suspense and indecision of the court respecting us, 
has kept many at a distance, with whom I should otherwise 
have been on a very familiar footing, and some of them 
have been so candid as to tell me so. This is a kind of 
prudence winch naturally grows out of a jealous and absolute government, under which the people have, for many 
generations, been habituated to that kind of dependence, 
which constrains every class to watch and respect the 
opinions and inclinations of their superiors in power. The 
prosperous tide of our affairs, however, has for some time 
past run so strong, that I think many of our obstacles here 
must soon give way. Shyness will then cease, and I shall 
not afterward find it difficult to be received into more of 
their houses, and that in the only manner I ever wish to be 
received into any — I mean, at the front door, by direct invitation from the masters of them, and without the precursory 
good offices of upper servants and unimportant favourites, 
whom I never can submit to court. Until this period arrives, I shall continue to cultivate the few acquaintances I 
have, and without giving offence to any, endeavour to 
increase their number, whenever it may be done with propriety and to advantage ; but I shall, as heretofore, avoid 
embarrassing and intruding upon those who, in the mean 
time, may think it necessary to be reserved. Self-respect 
joins with prudence in pointing out this line of conduct; and 
as I have no enemies of my own making, I am persuaded 
that instead of losing, I shall eventually be a gainer, by adheriag to it, especially as those who may have been led to 
ascribe this conduct to improper motives, will then immediately find themselves undeceived. 
Be pleased to present our compliments and best wishes 
to Mrs. Morris, and our friends with you.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I devote this first leisure moment which has occurred 
since my arrival, to the pleasure of writing a few lines 
to you. 
</p><p>
Our journey was pursued, without any avoidable intermission, to Bayonne, where it became advisable to rest a 
few days, and where we received many kind attentions from 
Mons. Formalaguer, to whom, it seems, you had be m so 
obliging as to make friendly mention of us. That city is 
turning its attention to the American trade, and its situation, 
in certain respects, is favourable to that design. 
</p><p>
Your friend, Mons. Risleau, at Bordeaux, pleased me 
much ; there is a frankness in his manner, and a warmth 
about his heart, that is very engaging. I made some agreeable acquaintances in that city, and wish I could have staid 
longer with them. Commerce appears to flourish there ; 
and if their trade with America could be properly protected, 
there is reason to think that it would soon become an object 
of great importance. 
</p><p>
On leaving Bordeaux, Mrs. Jay caught an intermitting 
fever, which, with the great demand made for post-horses 
made by the Prince du Nord, delayed us greatly. 
</p><p>
I went with <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a> to Versailles the day after our 
arrival. The minister spoke of you in terms very friendly, 
and very just, and my next visit would have been to the 
Countess de Montmorin ; but as we learned that a mail was 
to be dismissed for <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> today, we returned immediately to prepare our despatches, so that I have been 
obliged to deny myself the honour of paying my respects 
to a lady, whose character and connexion with you render 
me particularly desirous of seeing. To-morrow we are 
promised a visit from the Marquis de La Fayette and his 
lad} 7 , after which I shall take the first opportunity " meponer 
a los pies de la Condesa Lc Montmorin" I am not sure 
that this is good Spanish ; if not, I wish the inspectors of the 
post-office may be so obliging as to correct it. 
</p><p>
I had written thus far when a variety of interruptions 
prevented my proceeding for several days, and then I became violently attacked with the influenza, from which I 
am now just beginning to recover. It has been very severe 
on all my family. Mrs. Jay has been obliged to struggle 
with that and the intermittent fever together, and this is 
the first day she has been out of the house since our arrival. 
</p><p>
I am very much mortified at not having yet seen the 
Countess de Montmorin. The day before I was taken sick 
I did myself the honour of calling at her house, but she was 
from home. As soon as the doctor sets me at liberty, the 
first use I will make of it will be to renew my visit. 
</p><p>
What I have seen of France pleases me exceedingly. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a> has received some late noble proofs of the 
king's liberality, in the liquidation of his accounts, and the 
terms and manner of paying the balance due on them. No 
people understand doing civil things so well as the French. 
The aids they have afforded us received additional value 
from the generous and gracious manner in which they were 
supplied ; and that circumstance will have a proportionable 
decree of influence in cementing the connexion formed 
between the two countries. 
</p><p>
I think the late resolutions and conduct of America, 
respecting Mr. Carlton's proposed correspondence with 
Congress, must have given you pleasure. As Mons. de 
Clonard passed through Spain, he doubtless brought you 
copies. Some letters and instructions I have received by 
the same vessel, contain strong evidence of the determination of Congress to consult the interest and wishes of France 
upon all occasions. 
</p><p>
I have seen and dined with the Count d'Aranda ; his conversation leads me to suspect that his court is, at last, in 
earnest. This, however, is a question which facts, and not 
words, must determine. It is hard to judge of men, especially of old politicians ; at present I like the count, for he 
appears frank and candid, as well as sagacious. They say 
he is a little obstinate, but, for my part, I prefer plain-dealing, 
obstinate men, to those unstable ones who, like the moon, 
change once a fortnight, and are mere dispensers of borrowed light. 
</p><p>
I cannot forbear mentioning, that I am particularly 
indebted to the polite attention of your friend, Count 
d'Estaing. He is at Passy, enjoying otium cam dignitateThere is a singular taste displayed in the ornaments of his 
house. The very walls (like Portius in Addison's Cato) 
are ambitiously sententious, and show that they do not 
belong to an ordinary man.

Dear Robert, 
</p><p>
Almost ever since my arrival here I have had, and still 
have, a sick family. The epidemic disorder which has 
spread through the northern part of Europe has been severe 
upon us. I am free from it at present, but it has taken from 
me some flesh and much strength. Mrs. Jay has frequent 
attacks of an irregular intermitting fever, and our little girl 
is not yet wholly out of danger. 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 22d May, and the one enclosed with it 
from your good mother, contain the first advices I received 
of my father's death. My last letter from Frederick was 
of an earlier date. That intelligence was not unexpected. 
I wish I had been with him ; but it is a temporary separation, and I am resigned. It has added to the number of my 
inducements to walk in his steps, and thereby arrive at the 
same home. 
</p><p>
I feel very sensibly for Peter and Nancy. They are ever 
in my thoughts. I thank you sincerely for becoming my 
agent. <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a> had paid me nine months' salary a 
few days before your letters arrived, and too great a part 
of it was pre-engaged to admit of my repaying it and waiting for bills. 
</p><p>
I must request the favour of you to pay twenty pounds 
York money to Miss Kitty Livingston on account of my 
little boy, and one hundred and fifty pounds like money to 
Frederick, Peter, and Nancy, — to each fifty pounds. Arrange this through Mr. Benson. I hear my father has 
given some of the servants free, and that some other of the 
older ones have been put out. Old servants are sometimes 
neglected. Desire Mr. Benson to keep an eye over them, 
and not let any of them want ; and for that purpose, place 
fifty pounds in his hands, which he will apply according to 
his discretion, as necessity may, from time to time, require. 
He must also reimburse himself for any expenses he may 
be at on this account. I should write to him also on this 
subject, but have neither health nor time, having at present 
a violent headache and a little fever, and my letter must be 
sent to the Marquis de La Fayette's this evening. Adieu, 
</p><p>
my friend.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Wherever and however occupied, I rememher my friends, 
and always find my own satisfaction promoted when I have 
reason to think that I am conducing to theirs. This has 
led me to make your sons the subject of this letter. It is 
an interesting one to you, and therefore not indifferent 
to me. 
</p><p>
On my arrival here, I found them placed in a. pension at 
Passy. My daughter was ill with a whooping-cough, and, 
lest your sons should catch it, we denied ourselves the pleasure of having them with us until after that obstacle had 
ceased. I have frequently seen them at <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a>'s, as 
well as at my own house. They had promised to dine with 
us every Wednesday, but Mr. Ridley prolonged it to every 
other Wednesday. They are fine boys, and appear to possess a full share of natural talents. I am told that theyhave made a progress in French proportionate to the time 
they have been learning it. Of this I am not an adequate 
judge myself, and therefore must depend on the judgment 
of others. The pension at which they are has been so far 
well enough; but I think, with Mr. Ridley, that a better is 
to be wished for, and to be sought. He is at present 
making the necessary inquiries, and I have every reason to 
believe that the trust you have reposed in him will be conscientiously and faithfully executed. 
</p><p>
Mr. Ridley finds it difficult to decide on the expediency 
of carrying them to Geneva ; and, from what 1 have heard, 
I think he has reason to entertain doubts on that head. As 
I have no materials to judge from but the report of others, 
and those perhaps not altogether well-founded, it is difficult for me to form a decided opinion on the subject. I 
can only say, that I have heard more against it than for it. 
</p><p>
My opinion may perhaps seem singular, and the more so as it cannot be properly explained in the compass of a letter. 
I think the youth of every free civilized country should, if 
possible, be educated in it, and not permitted to travel out 
of it till age has made them so cool and firm as to retain 
their national and moral impressions. Connexions formed 
at school and college have much influence, and are to be 
watched even at that period. If judiciously formed, they 
will often endure and be advantageous through life. American youth may possibly form proper, and perhaps useful, 
friendships in European seminaries, but I think not so probably as among their fellow-citizens, with whom they arc to 
grow up, whom it will be useful for them to know and be 
early known to, and with whom they are to be engaged in 
the business of active life, and under the eve and direction 
of parents whose advice, authority, and example are frequently of more worth than the lessons of hireling professors, particularly on the subjects of religion, morality, 
virtue, and prudence. 
</p><p>
The fine, and some of the useful, arts may doubtless be 
better acquired in Europe than America, and so may the 
living European languages ; but when I consider that a 
competent knowledge even of these may be gained in our 
countrv, and that almost all of the more substantial and 
truly valuable acquirements may, in my opinion, with more 
facilitv and certainty be attained there than here, I do not 
hesitate to prefer an American education. 
</p><p>
I fear that the ideas which my countrymen in general 
conceive of Europe are in many respects rather too high. 
If we should ever meet again, you shall know my sentiments 
very fully on that head. 
</p><p>
But your sons are here, and what is to be done ? !Mr. Ridley is about doing what I think, with him, is the best 
thincr that can at present be done, viz. to put them in one 
of the best pensions that can be found, and to give them 
the advantage of such extra tutors as may be requisite. 
</p><p>
Perhaps further information may place Geneva in a more 
favourable light. You shall have frequent letters from me 
on this subject ; and while I remain here, you may be 
assured of my constant attentions to these promising boys. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
With great esteem and regard,

Dear Morris, 
</p><p>
I have received your festina Jente letter, but wish it had 
been at least partly in cipher ; you need not be informed of 
my reasons for the wish, as by this time you must know 
that seals are, on this side of the water, rather matters of 
decoration than of use It gave me nevertheless great 
pleasure to receive that letter, it being the first from you 
that had reached me, the Lord knows when. I find you 
are industrious, and of consequence, useful ; so much the 
better for yourself, for the public, and for our friend Morris, 
whom I consider as the pillar of American credit. 
</p><p>
The king of Great Britain, by letters patent under the 
great seal, has authorized Mr. Oswald to treat with the 
commissioners of the United States of America. His first 
commission literally pursued the enabling act, and the authority it gave him was expressed in the very terms of that 
act, viz. to treat with the colonies, and with any or either 
of them, and any part of them, and with any description of 
men in them, and with any person whatsoever, of and concerning peace, &c. 
</p><p>
Had I not violated the instructions of Congress, their 
dignity would have been in the dust ; for the French minister even took pains, not only to persuade us to treat under 
that commission, but to prevent the second, by telling Fitzherbert that the first was sufficient. I told the minister that we neither could nor would treat with any nation in the 
world on any other than on an equal footing. 
</p><p>
We may and we may not have a peace this winter. 
Act as if the war would certainly continue. Keep proper 
garrisons in your strong posts ; and preserve your army 
sufficiently numerous, and well appointed, until every idea 
of hostility and surprise shall have completely vanished. 
</p><p>
I could write you a volume, but my health admits only 
of short intervals of application. 
</p><p>
Present my best wishes to Mr. and Mrs. Morris, and 
such other of our friends as may ask how we do. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Morris,

I shall always be exceedingly happy, my lad_\'. in every 
opportunity of confirming the favourable opinion with 
which your ladyship and the amiable friend to whom I 
believe you allude, have been impressed. The misfortunes 
incident to war are always to be regretted, and humanity 
will not cease to sympathize with those on either side, who, 
without deserving, have experienced its rigours. 
</p><p>
It gives me pleasure to inform your ladyship, that according to the preliminaries agreed to between Great Britain 
and America, Congress will recommend in a very benevolent manner to the reconsideration of the different States, 
the measures they have taken against certain individuals. 
The nature of our government rendered every other mode 
of revising those cases improper ; and as some persons 
might have much, others little, and many no reason to complain, ft was the most eligible and obvious mode of ascertaining the merits of each ; there is also reason to expect 
that whatever undue degrees of severity may have been 
infused into our laws by a merciless war, and a strong 
sense of injuries, will yield to the influence of those gentler 
emotions, which the mild and cheerful season of peace and 
tranquillity must naturally excite. 
</p><p>
Your ladyship will, therefore, see the necessity as well 
as propriety of applying after the war, to the Legislature 
of Pennsylvania, for a reconsideration of the act respecting 
your family. For my part, I believe that justice will be 
done to all ; and I hope that clemency and reconciliation 
will be refused only to the faithless and the cruel. The 
same magnanimity which has distinguished the conduct of 
America in times of danger and distress, will doubtless 
enable her to receive prosperity with dignity and gratitude, 
and to use it with moderation and philanthropy. 
I have the honour to be, with perfect respect, 
Your ladyship's 
Most obedient and most humble servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
From our preliminaries and the king's speech, the present 
disposition and system of the British court may, in my 
opinion, be collected. Although particular circumstances 
constrained them to yield us more than perhaps they 
wished, I still think they meant to make (what they thought 
would really be) a satisfactory peace with us. In the continuance of this disposition and system too much confidence 
ought not to be placed, for disappointed violence and mortified ambition are certainly dangerous foundations to build 
implicit confidence upon ; but I cannot forbear thinking 
that we ought not, in the common phrase, to throw cold 
water upon it by improper exultation, extravagant demands, 
or illiberal publications ; should such a temper appear, it 
would be wise to discountenance it. It is our policy to be 
independent in the most extrusive sense, and to observe a 
proper distance towards all nations, minding our own business, and not interfering with, or being influenced bv, the 
views of any, further than they may respect us. 
</p><p>
Some of my colleagues flatter themselves with the probability of obtaining compensation for damages. I have no 
objections to a further trial, but I confess I doubt its success, for Britain has no money to spare, and will think the 
confiscations should settle that account, for they do not 
expect that retribution will be made to all. 
</p><p>
Our affairs have a very promising aspect, and a little 
prudence will secure us all that we can reasonably expect. 
The boundaries between the States should be immediately 
settled, and all causes of discord between them removed. 
It would be imprudent to disband the army while a foreign 
one remains in the country; and it would be equally unwise to permit Americans to spill the blood of our friends 
in the islands, for in all of them there are many who wish 
us well. The sale of the continental lands would, if properly regulated and appropriated to that purpose, form a 
fund on which we might borrow money, especially if 
foreigners could see good reason to rely on our good faith, 
which, by being in certain instances violated, has lost much 
of its credit. I allude particularly to the interest on loanoffice certificates, and the publications in our papers on that 
subject, which do us harm in Europe. Adieu.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for your obliging letter of the 26th 
December last, which the marchioness was so kind as to 
send me yesterday. I congratulate you on your safe arrival at Cadiz, and you have my best wishes, that the same 
good fortune you have hitherto experienced, may continue 
to attend you. 
</p><p>
The state of my health making a change of air and exercise advisable, I left Paris ten days ago on an excursion 
into Normandy. Hence, I suppose, it has happened that 
I have neither heard of nor seen your letters to Dr. 
Franklin. 
</p><p>
If I am not mistaken, a copy of the American preliminaries has been sent to Spain ; and I flatter myself that Count de Montmorin will think them perfectly consistent with our 
engagements to our allies. It appears to me singular that any doubts should be entertained of American good faith ; 
for as it has been tried and remains inviolate, they cannot easily be explained on principles honourable to those who 
entertain them. America has so often repeated and reiterated her professions and assurances of regard to the treaty 
alluded to, that I hope she will not impair her dignity by making any more of them ; but leave the continued uprightness of her conduct to inspire that confidence which it 
seems she does not yet possess, although she has always merited. 
</p><p>
Our warmest acknowledgments are due to you for the zeal you manifest to serve America, at all times and in all places ; but, sir, I have little expectation that your plan of 
a Spanish loan will succeed. I confess that I am far from being anxious about it. In my opinion, America can, with no propriety, accept favours from Spain. 
</p><p>
My absence from Paris has deprived me of the means of information, and therefore I cannot at present gratify either 
your wishes or my own on that head. God knows whether or not we shall have peace. A variety of contradictory 
reports daily reach me, but they deserve little credit. It is again said, that <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> is evacuated — that may be. 
It is also said, the enemy have left New-York ; but I adhere to my former opinion, and do not believe a word of it. Mrs. Jay writes me that Mr. Oswald is gone to London, 
but for what purpose I am ignorant. Thus, my dear sir, are we held in a state of suspense, which nothing but time 
can remove. I purpose to return next week to Paris, and shall then write to you again. Adieu. 
</p><p>
I am, with perfect respect and esteem,

Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 10th inst. was delivered to me a few davs ago. 
</p><p>
The reason to which you ascribe my not having answered the other you wrote me was the true one, viz. that it was unnecessary. 
</p><p>
The time has been, when my writing to you would not 
have depended on such a circumstance, for you arc not 
mistaken in supposing that I was once your friend. I really 
was, and should still have been so, had you not advised 
Americans to desert that independence, which they had 
pledged to each other, their lives, their fortunes, and their 
sacred honour to support. 
</p><p>
The charges against you of peculation undoubtedly called 
for strict and speedy inquiry ; but I expected that you 
would make a satisfactory defence against them. I hope 
so still. 
</p><p>
I will write to Congress about your accounts as you desire. Justice certainly demands that they should be liquidated and settled. 
</p><p>
Dr. Bancroft, some time ago, asked my opinion as to 
your going to England. I told him it would be imprudent, 
but not that "it would be taken ill." To my knowledge, 
you was and are suspected of being in the British interest. 
Such a step would have strengthened that suspicion, and at 
that interesting period would have countenanced harsh 
conjectures as to the motives and objects of your journey, 
which for my part I could not divine. Perhaps the suspicion I mention is new to you ; if so, the information is 
important. 
</p><p>
Before this will come to your hands, and you could afterward get to London, the above mentioned objections will 
be weakened ; and as circumstances press your going, it is 
probable you will venture. Let me advise you to be prudent, and to be cautious what company you keep, and what 
conversation you hold in that country. 
</p><p>
I* write thus plainly and fully, because I still indulge an 
idea, that your head mav have been more to blame than 
your heart; and that in some melancholy desponding hour, 
the disorder of your nerves infected your opinions and your pen. God grant that this may prove to have been the 
case, and that I may yet have reason to resume my former 
opinion, that you was a valuable, a virtuous, and a patriotic 
man. Whenever this may happen, I will, with great and 
sincere satisfaction, again become 
</p><p>
Your friend, 
</p><p>
John Jay

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Whence came the idea, that the moment a minister loses 
a question in parliament, he must be displaced ? That kings 
should adopt such a maxim is not very unnatural, but that 
a free parliament should think an influential dictator < 
them necessary to the government of the kingdom, seems 
rather a new opinion. Perhaps it arose gradually from the 
practices of the court and the decay of public virtue during 
the last hundred years. 
</p><p>
So far as the peace respects France and America, I am 
persuaded it was wise in Britain to conclude it. The 
cessions to France are not, in my opinion, extravagant ; 
and the terms settled with America, m removing all causes 
of future variance, certainly load to conciliation and friendship. 
</p><p>
It appears to me that the discussion of this subject might 
have been more ample and satisfactory. Why was not 
parliament told of our offer i rce, and the mu
tual navigation of the American waters? The word ; 
procity would not then have been deemed so nug 
</p><p>
We have received particular instructions on the business 
of commerce, and Mr. Fitzherbert has been informed of our 
readiness to add to th< isional treaty, an article for 
</p><p>
opening and regulating the trade between us on principles 
as liberal and reciprocal as you please. What more can 
be said or done ? Mr. Pitt's bill was a good one, a wise one, and one that will for ever do honour to the extent and 
policy of his views, and to those of the administration 
undcrwho.se auspices it was formed. For my own part, 
however, 1 think that. America need not be exceedingly 
anxious about the matter; for it will be in our power to 
derive from a navigation act of our own, full as many 
advantages as we should lose by the restrictions of your laws. 
</p><p>
The objections drawn from your treaties with Russia, 
&c. appear to me weak, and have been answered; but 
why not give them similar terms on similar conditions ? 
They furnish you with raw materials chiefly, and you them 
with manufactures only. The gain, therefore, must be 
yours. With respect to carriage and navigation, they stand 
in a very different predicament from us. 
</p><p>
As to the tories who have received damage from us, why 
so much noise about them, and so little said or thought of 
;s who have suffered ten times as much from these same 
tories, not to mention the desolations of an unjust and licentious war. 
</p><p>
We forget our sufferings, and even agree to recommend 
to favour a set of men, of whoi i very few would consider 
the having their deserts in the light of a blessing. How 
does reciprocity stand in this account ? 
</p><p>
Some, it seems, think that New-York should be retained 
as a rod to drive us on in this business of the tories. Strange 
that the idea of driving us should still be entertained. I 
pledge myself to you that, should such a design be adopted 
and become apparent, the refugees will get nothing, and the 
progress of reconciliation will be as slow as the warmest 
Gallican could wish. 
</p><p>
I hear there is to be a Congress here ; that is, that Britain and France have requested the two imperial courts to send 
mediatorial ambassadors here for the purpose of being witnesses to the execution of the definitive treaties ; — a very 
important errand, no doubt, and very complimentary to those sovereigns. Is it probable that a Congress should be 
called for that poor, single, simple purpose ? Why your court agreed to it is hard to conceive. 
</p><p>
I have written to my countrymen, that Lord Shelburne's 
system respecting them appeared to me to be liberal and 
conciliatory, but that his hesitations about avowing the 
acknowledgment of our independence discouraged extensive confidence without further facts. I always think it 
best to be candid and explicit. I hope we shall soon be in 
the full possession of our country and of peace, and as we 
expect to have no further cause of quarrel with Great 
Britain, we can have no inducement to wish or to do her 
injury ; on the contrary, we may become as sensible to her 
future good offices as we have been to her former evil 
ones. A little good-natured wisdom often does more in 
politics than much slippery craft. By the former, the French 
acquired the esteem and gratitude of America, and by the 
latter, their minister is impairing it. 
</p><p>
Thus I have written you a hasty letter. Since the 
receipt of yours, until this moment, I have been promising 
myself the pleasure of paying you a visit. I now find it 
probable that I shall be detained here some time longer. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Jay charges me to say civil things to you. You are 
a favourite of hers, and deserve to be so of everybody. 
Our little girl is well, and when able to speak, shall be taught 
to send you her compliments. I shall reply to certain parts 
of your letter in my next ; at present, I am pressed for 
time. I must not, however, forget my worthy friend, Mr. Oswald. He deserves well of his country, and posterity 
will not only approve, but commend his conduct. Assure 
him of my esteem and attachment, and believe me to be, 
with the best wishes for the health and happiness of Mrs. 
Vaughan and your little daughter,

Dear Sir,

Permil me to introduce to you a gentleman who is going 
to help you to pay tuxes, and to participate in the liberties 
which render them necessary, viz. Mr. Joshua Grigley. 
Mr. 13. Vaughan u rites me that this gentleman has considerable property, which you know will qualify him for the 
iirst, and that he has also much virtue and merit, which will 
enable him to sustain, as well as to enjoy, the latter. Thus, 
you see, he will be an addition to our collective property 
and respectability, and, consequently, comes naturally within 
your two departments of financier and patriot. 
</p><p>
But you have also another department to which I must 
take the liberty of recommending this gentleman. He is a 
friend of Mr. Vaughan — he is a gentleman — he is a stranger 
— he is young. I know you too well to enlarge, or to add 
any thing except an assurance, with which I could, with as 
little hesitation, conclude my days as my letter, viz. that I 
am, with great esteem and atlectionate regard,

Dear Frank, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 1st of January last was delivered to 
me yesterday, and gives me pleasure. You do well to look 
forward to the means of exercising your profession to 
advantage. You shall continue to have my aid and protection, in such measure and season, as circumstances may 
render proper and expedient. 
</p><p>
Mr. Francis Child was an indigent boy, who had been educated at <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel=''>Mr. Jay</a>'s expense. The press mentioned in this letter was obtained, and on it 
Mr. Child printed the first daily newspaper published in the city of NewYork after the revolution. 
</p><p>
You belong to a large and helpless family, and I wish to 
see you as able, as I hope you would be willing, to provide 
for them. 
</p><p>
I think with you, that on the evacuation of New-York, 
you may set up a press there with a good prospect of success. On speaking to <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a> yesterday about it, he 
told me that when the enemy left <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, they carried 
from thence to New- York, a printing-press of his, and that 
it is now in the possession of one Robinson, a printer, at 
New-York. As by the provisional treaty the British forces 
are not to carry away any effects of the inhabitants, this 
press may perhaps be recovered. The Dr. has desired me 
to prepare a letter of attorney for the purpose, to some person in New-York, and in case it should be restored, will 
lend it to you. I shall immediately think of furnishing you 
with some types, and <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a> has promised his assistance, so that you may soon expect to hear from me again 
about these matters. In the mean time, write a letter of 
thanks t<> the Dr. for his kind attention. 
</p><p>
I must remind you that you should extend your application beyond the mere mechanical [-art of your business. 
You will have to compose as well as to print, and you 
should take pains not only to store your mind with useful 
knowledge, but also to acquire the talent of writing in a 
clear, concise, and accurate style. Remember too, that an 
acquaintance with accounts, and the method of keeping 
them, is not to be neglected. It is important to all men, 
and particularly to those who cannot afford to be careless. 
If you are industrious, prudent, and punctual in the conduct 
of your business, you will most certainly succeed ; and my 
desire of helping you, instead of abating, will be increased 
by your endeavours to help yourself.

I have, within these few days past, road and admired 
your address to the army, and their proceedings in consequence of it. Such instances of patriotism are rare, and 
America must find it difficult to express, in adequate terms, 
the gratitude she owes to both. Such a degree of glory »

new as our political constellation, and. will for ever give 
lustre to it. May every blessing be yours.

Mr. Hartley has just informed me that orders have been sent to the British commander-in-chief to evacuate the

Dear Madam,

I have long been accustomed to hear, and I might add 
read, so much in which the heart has no concern, that the 
few letters like yours which reach me, arc particularly 
welcome. 
</p><p>
The peace appears to me, as it does to you, to be seasonable as well as advantageous; and I sincere]}' join with 
you in ascribing that and every other of our b] s to 
</p><p>
the Supreme Author of all the good that ever was and 
ever will be in the world. 
As your letter is of the 12th April, and as I have received others dated late in May, which mention nothing of 
my sister, I indulge some little hope that she is still alive ; 
if so, I shall be very thankful ; if not, God's will be done. 
To her, this world has not been a paradise. Her leaving it 
will be a misfortune to the few who knew her worth, and 
to whom she was attached. She will have reason to rejoice in the change. I feel most sensibly for the effect it 
would have on my brother; it would double the pressure 
of all his afflictions. God grant him resignation, and permit me to return soon to comfort him. He has every right 
to expect it from me, and if my life be spared, he shall not 
be disappointed. I cannot proceed.

God bless you, my dear madam ;

Dear Morris, 
</p><p>
By this time, I suppose there is much canvassing for 
foreign appointments. I thank you for thinking of me, but 
as I mean to return in the spring, your arrangements, so 
far as respects me, must be altered. Upon this point I am 
decided, and beg of you to tell my friends so. 
</p><p>
Orders are gone to evacuate New- York. The present 
British ministry are duped, I believe, by an opinion of our 
not having decision and energy sufficient to regulate our 
trade, so as to retaliate their restrictions. Our ports were 
opened too soon. Let us, however, be temperate as well 
as firm. 
</p><p>
Our friend Morris, I suspect, is not a favourite of this 
court. They say, he treats them as his cashier. They 
refuse absolutely to supply more money. Marbois writes 
tittle-tattle, and I believe does mischief. Congress certainly should remove to some interior town, and they should send a minister forthwith to England. The French 
ambassador at Petersburg has thrown cold water on Dana's being received before a pi ace. 
</p><p>
The ministers of this court are qualified to act the part of Proteus. The nation, I think, is with us, and the king 
seems to be well disposed. Adieu.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On the 1st instant, I had the pleasure of receiving your favour of the 21st May hist. 
</p><p>
I am happy to hear that the provisional articles meet 
with general approbation. The tories will doubtless cause 
some difficulty, bul thai they have always done, and as this 
will probably be the hist time, we musl m; : best of it. 
A universal indiscriminate condemnation and expulsion of 
those people, would not r< dound to our honour, because so 
harsh a measure would partake more of vengeance than of 
justice. For my part, I wish that all except the faith 
and the cruel may be forgiven. That exception would 
indeed extend to very few ; but even if it applied to the 
case of one only, that one ought, in my opinion, to be 
saved. 
</p><p>
The reluctance with which the States in general pay the 
necessary taxes, is much to be regretted ; it injures both 
their reputation and interest abroad, as well as at home, 
and tends to cherish the hopes and speculations of those 
who wish we may become and remain an unimportant, 
divided people. The rising power of America is a serious 
object of apprehension to more than one nation, and every 
event that may retard it will be agreeable to them. A 
continental, national spirit should therefore pervade our 
country, and Congress should be enabled, by a grant of the 
necessary powers, to regulate the commerce and general 
concerns of the confederacy ; and we should remember 
that to be constantly prepared for war, is the only way to 
have peace. The Swiss on the one hand, and the Dutch 
on the other, bear testimony to the truth of this remark. 
</p><p>
The general and the army have, by their late moderation, 
done themselves infinite honour ; and it is to be hoped that 
the States will not only be just, but generous to those brave 
and virtuous citizens. America is at present held in a very 
respectable point of view, but as the eyes of the world are 
upon her, the continuance of that consideration will depend 
on the dignity and wisdom of her conduct. 
</p><p>
I mean to return next spring. My health is somewhat 
better.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
By Capt. Barney I was favoured with yours of the 31st 
May. By this time T hope you will have received several 
letters from me, which were then on the way. Want of 
health has long made much writing painful to me, so that 
my letters in general are short. 
</p><p>
My jaunt to Normandy did me some service, but less 
than I expected. The pare air of this place has been useful to me. The pain in my breast has abated, and I have 
had no fever since 1 came here, which was about six weeks ago. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=gom' rel='colleague friend met'>Gouverneur</a> is happy in your esteem; it adds to mine 
for him. I have Ions been attached to him, and sincerely 
wish that our friendship, instead of being diminished, may 
continue to erain strength with time. 
</p><p>
Your intended resignation alarmed me, and would have 
been followed with ill consequences to our affairs. I rejoice 
that you continue in office, and by no means regret that it 
will be less in your power than inclination to retire soon. 
I am well aware of the difficulties you will continue to experience. Everyman so circumstanced must expect them. 
Your office is neither an easy nor a pleasant one to execute, 
but it is elevated and important, and therefore envy, with 
her inseparable companion injustice, will not cease to plague 
you. Remember, however, that triumphs do not precede 
victory, and that victory is seldom found in the smooth 
paths of peace and tranquillity. Your enemies would be 
happy to drive you to resign, and in my opinion both your 
interest and that of your country oppose your gratifying 
them. You have health, fortune, talents, and fortitude, and 
you have children too. Each of these circumstances recommend perseverance. 
</p><p>
As to money this court will afford you no further supplies. The minister has said, it was easy to be a financier 
and draw bills, when others provided the funds to pay them, 
At another time, he intimated that his court was not treated 
with a proper degree of delicacy on thai subject, and said, 
"that you treated them as your cashiers." A French 
officer from America, who is a friend ofyours, told me that 
La Luzerne and Marbois were not pleased with the manner of your applications to them about money matters. I 
mention these facts, because it may be useful for you to 
know them. 
</p><p>
The loan in Holland goes on, and from that quarter your 
bills must lie saved, if at all. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Adams</a> sot out for Amsterdam the day before yesterday, and will push on that 
business. If the Dutch began to draw benefit from our 
trade, they would lend more cheerfully. 
</p><p>
The British ministry have not yet authorized Mr. Hartley 
to consent to any thing as to commerce. They amuse him 
and us, and deceive themselves. I told him yesterday that 
they would find us like a globe ; not to be overset. They 
wish to be the only carriers between their islands and other 
countries; and though they are apprized of our right to 
regulate our trade as we please, yet I suspect they flatter 
themselves that the different States possess too little of a 
national or continental spirit, ever to agree in any one 
national system. I think they will find themselves mistaken.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been favoured with your letter of yesterday, and will answer it explicitly. 
</p><p>
I have no reason whatever to believe that you was 
averse to our obtaining the lull extent of boundary and 
fisher}- secured to us by the treaty. Your conduct respecting them throughout the negotiation indicated a strong and 
a ste;id_\- attachment to both these objects, and in my 
opinion, promoted the attainment of them. 
</p><p>
I remember that in a conversation which Mr. de Rayneval, the first secretary of Count de Vergennes, had with 
you and me, in the summer of <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a>, you contended for 
our full right to the fishery, and argued it on various 
principles. 
</p><p>
lour letters to me, when in Spain, considered our territory as extending to the Mississippi, and expressed your 
opinion against ceding the navigation of that river in very 
strong and pointed terms. 
</p><p>
In short, sir, I do not recollect the least difference in sentiment between us respecting the boundaries or fisheries ; 
on the contrary, we were unanimous and united in adhering to and insisting on them. nor did I ever perceive the 
least disposition in either of us to recede from our claims, 
or be satisfied with less than we obtained. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, with great respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>

Dear Robert, 
</p><p>
At your farm with your family, in peace, and in plenty, 
how happy is your situation! I wish you may not have 
retired too soon. It is certain you may do much good 
where you are. and perhaps in few things more than in impressing by precept, influence, and example, the indispensable necessity of rendering the continental and State governments vigorous and orderly. 
Europe hears much, and wishes to hear more of divisions, 
seditions, violences, and confusions among us. The tories 
are generally and greatly pitied, more indeed than they deserve. The indiscriminate expulsion and ruin of that whole 
class and description of men, would not do honour to our 
magnanimity or humanity, especially in the opinion of those 
nations who consider with more astonishment than pleasure 
the terms of peace which America has obtained. <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>General Washington</a>'s letter does him credit as a soldier, patriot, 
and Christian. I wish his advice may meet with the 
attention it merits. 
</p><p>
Mr. Hartley is gone to London, and expects soon to return and resume the discussion of commercial regulations, 
&c. He has assured us officially, that Britain is not resolved to adhere to the line marked out in their proclamation respecting the West India trade. I doubt their 
knowing themselves what tiny mean to do. In my opinion, 
we should adhere to exact reciprocity with all nations, and 
were we well united, they would yield to it. He assured us, also, that orders were given for the evacuation of NewYork. 
</p><p>
We have had much cool weather lately, and I find myself the better for it. All the people are running after airglobes. The invention of them may have many consequences, and who knows but travellers may hereafter literally pass from country to country on the wings of the 
wind. 
</p><p>
Assure vour good family of our sincere regard, and believe me to be, dear Robert,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The day before yesterday I was favoured with your friendly letter of 1st July. . 
</p><p>
To whatever cause the suspension of our correspondence may have been owing, I am persuaded that it did not 
originate cither with you or with me. How far my conjectures on that subject may be well founded, will be ascertained when we meet. 
</p><p>
Had your reason for retiring been less urgent than that of 
ill health, I should have thought it premature. While government remains relaxed, and the laws have yet to acquire 
a due degree of respect and obedience, men of talents, 
weight, and influence should exert themselves to establish 
and maintain constitutional authority and subordination. 
</p><p>
No less wisdom and perseverance is necessary to preserve and secure what we have gained, than were requisite 
in the acquisition ; and experience informs us that internal 
commotions and confusion are as injurious to the peace and 
happiness of society, as war and enemies from abroad. 
Well-ordered government is essential to the duration and 
enjoyment of the tranquillity and leisure you promise yourself at <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, and therefore domestic as well as public 
considerations call upon you for such a degree of attention 
to these subjects as your health will admit of. 
</p><p>
I hope and expect next summer to return. Not only my 
family and my private concerns require it, but also the 
principles which led me into public life. But if, on my 
return, I find it my duty to devote more of my time to the 
public, they shall have it, though retirement is what I 
ardently desire. 
</p><p>
I am not surprised that men of certain characters should 
censure the terms of peace. There are men who view subjects only on the dark side ; there are others who find 
fault to show their discernment ; and we meet with some 
whose opinions are wholly decided by ideas of convenience 
and personal politics. I am happy, however, to hear that 
the great majority are content. In the opinion of Europe, 
they have great reason to be so.

Dear Morris, 
</p><p>
The sight of your friendly letter of the 25th of July last, 
and of those it recommends, gave me much pleasure. 
Marks of remembrance from old acquaintances, and the 
society of fellow-citizens in a foreign country, excite agreeable sensations. I have, as yet, met with neither men nor 
things on this side of the water which abate my predilection, or, if you please, my prejudices in favour of those on 
the other. I have but few attachments in Europe much 
stronger than those we sometimes feel for an accidental 
fellow-traveller, or for a good inn and a civil landlord. 
We leave our approbation, and good wishes, and a certain 
degree of regard with them, by way of paying that part of 
the reckoning and travelling expenses which money cannot 
always defray. My affections are deeply rooted in America, 
and are of too long standing to admit of transplantation. 
In short, my friend, I can never become so far a citizen of 
the world as to view every part of it with equal regard ; 
and perhaps nature is wiser in tying our hearts to our native 
soil, than they are who think they divest themselves of foibles in proportion as they wear away those bonds. It is 
not difficult to regard men of every nation as members of 
the same family ; but when placed in that point of view, 
my fellow-citizens appear to me as my brethren, and the 
others as related to me only in the more distant and adventitious degrees. 
</p><p>
I am glad my letter by Mr. Grigby gave you reason to 
infer an alteration for the better in the state of my health, 
because I flatter myself it afforded pleasure to my friends. 
The tact is, that my disorder has been gradually declining 
ever since I left the city ; but although the pain in my 
breast has diminished, it still continues, and daily tells me 
memento mori. As to the fever which the influenza left 
me, it has at last, thank God, taken its leave. During all 
my sickness, I have been happy in preserving a constant 
flow of spirits ; and cheerfulness, that agreeable companion, 
has never forsaken me. I hope a trip to Bath will so 
patch up my " house of clay" as to render it tenantable 
a good while longer ; a thorough repair I do not promise 
myself. 
</p><p>
Your account of my son pleases me. I expect and wish 
to see him next summer ; for it is time to lay the foundation of those habits and principles by which I am desirous 
that his conduct through life should be influenced. Nature 
has not given to children any instinctive affections for their 
parents ; and youth, that fair season of virtue and ingenuousness, presents the only opportunity for our perfectly 
gaining their hearts. This conspires with a great variety of 
other considerations to call me home ; and I should not be 
satisfied with myself if I prolonged my excursion from private life beyond the term which, for public reasons, I at first 
prescribed it. When a man's conduct ceases to be uniform 
and consistent, it ceases to be proper. My little girls are 
well, and their mother is not much otherwise. So much 
for domestic matters ; now for a few lines on politics. 
</p><p>
While there are knaves and fools in the world, there will 
be wars in it ; and that nations should make war against 
nations is less surprising than their living in uninterrupted 
peace and harmony. 
</p><p>
You have heard that the Ottoman and Russian empires are 
on the point of unsheathing the sword. The objects of the 
contest are more easy to discern than the issue ; but if Russia 
should extend her navigation to Constantinople, we may be 
the better for it That circumstance is an additional motive to our forming a treaty of commerce with her. Your 
commercial and geographical knowledge render it unnecessary for me to enlarge on this subject. But whatever we 
may have to do abroad, it is of little consequence when 
compared to what we have to do at home. 
</p><p>
I am perfectly convinced that no time is to be lost in 
raising and maintaining a national spirit in America. Power 
to govern the confederacy, as to all general purposes, should 
be granted and exercised. The governments of the different 
States should be wound up, and become vigorous. America 
is beheld with jealousy, and jealousy is seldom idle. Settle 
your boundaries without delay. It is better that some 
improper limits should be fixed, than any left in dispute. 
In a word, every thing conducive to union and constitutional energy of government should be cultivated, cherished, 
and protected, and all counsels and measures of a contrary 
complexion should at least be suspected of impolitic views 
and objects. 
</p><p>
The rapid progress of luxury at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> is a frequent 
topic of conversation here ; and what is a little remarkable, 
I have not heard a single person speak of it in terms of 
.approbation.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Mr- Carter lately delivered to me your friendly letter of 
the 25th of July last. You was always of the number of 
those whom I esteemed, and your correspondence would 
have been both interesting and agreeable. I had heard of 
your marriage, and it gave me pleasure, as well because it 
added to your happiness, as because it tended to fix your 
residence in a State, of which I long wished you to be, and 
remain a citizen. 
</p><p>
The character and talents of delegates to Congress daily 
become more and more important, and I regret your declining that appointment at this interesting period. Respect, 
however, is due to the considerations which influence you; 
but as they do not oppose your accepting a place in the 
Legislature, I hope the public will still continue to derive 
advantage from your services. Much remains to be done, 
and labourers do not abound. 
</p><p>
I am happy to hear that the terms of peace, and the conduct of your negotiators, give general satisfaction ; but 
there are some of our countrymen, it seems, who are not 
content, and that too with an article which I thought to be 
very unexceptionable, viz. the one ascertaining our boundaries. Perhaps those gentlemen are latitudinarians. 
</p><p>
The American newspapers, for some months past, contain 
advices that do us harm. Violences, and associations 
against the tories, pay an ill compliment to government, 
and impeach our good faith in the opinions of some, and our 
magnanimity in the opinions of many. Our reputation 
also suffers from the apparent reluctance to taxes, and the 
ease with winch we incur debts without providing for their 
payment. The complaints of the army — the jealousies 
respecting Congress — the circumstances which induced 
their leaving <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> — and the too little appearance of 
a national spirit, pervading, uniting, and invigorating the 
confederacy, are considered as omens which portend the 
diminution of our respectability, power, and felicity. I 
hope that, as the wheel turns round, other and better indications will soon appear. I am persuaded that America 
possesses too much wisdom and virtue to permit her brilliant 
prospects to fade away for the want of either. But, whatever time may produce, certain it is, that our reputation 
and our affairs suffer from present appearances. 
</p><p>
The tories are as much pitied in these countries as they 
are execrated in ours. An undue degree of severity 
towards them would, therefore, be impolitic as well as 
unjustifiable. They who incline to involve that whole class 
of men in indiscriminate punishment and ruin, certainly 
carry the matter too far. It would be an instance of unnecessary rigour, and unmanly revenge, without a parallel, 
except in the annals of religious rage, in times of bigotry 
and blindness. What does it signify where nine-tenths of 
these people are buried ? I would rather see the sweat of 
their brows fertilizing our fields than those of our nei^hbours, in which it would certainly water those seeds of 
hatred, which, if so cultivated, may produce a hedge of 
thorns against us. Shall all be pardoned then? By no 
means. Banish and confiscate the estates' of such of 
them as have been either faithless or cruel, and forgive 
the rest. 
</p><p>
Victory and peace should, in my opinion, be followed by 
clemency, moderation, and benevolence, and we should be 
careful not to sully the glory of the revolution by licentiousness and cruelty. These are my sentiments, and however 
unpopular they may be, I have not the least desire to conceal or disguise them. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to present my best compliments to Mrs. 
Hamilton, and believe me to be,

I have been here a month, and well only two days. I

</p><p>
The parliament is sitting. The king's speech and its 
echoes you will see in the papers. I have not had any 
conversation on politics with either of the ministers. In 
my opinion, no plan or system of conduct respecting America is yet decided upon by the cabinet, in which the jarring 
principles of whig and tory still strive and ferment. The 
latter persuade themselves that we shall not be able to act 
as a nation, that our governments are too feeble to command 
respect, and our credit too much abased to recover its 
reputation, or merit confidence. I hope better things. We 
are not without friends in tins country, but they have more 
inclination than power to be friendly. We have also enemies, and bitter ones. If we act wisely and unitedly, we 
have nothing to fear. It is in our power finally to make a 
navigation act, and prevent British vessels carrying our productions ; provided we should execute it, we would find 
it of as much value as many treaties of commerce. Let 
us act, however, with temper ; it is more easy to make 
sores than to heal them. But if Britain should adopt and 
persist in a monopolizing system, let us retaliate fully and 
firmly. This nation, like many others, is influenced more 
by its feelings than reasonings. I am, dear sir,

Dear Kitty, 
</p><p>
Why so long silent, my good friend ? Many months 
have elapsed since we have been favoured with a line from 
you. I hope want of health has not obliged you to deny us 
that satisfaction. Want of inclination, I am sure, has not. 
Of that we have received too many unequivocal proofs to 
entertain the most distant doubt. You have long been my 
faithful, steady friend. I know the value of your esteem 
and regard, and be assured that you possess mine in a very 
high degree. Much do I wish for the happy moment when 
we shall all meet, and when Ave shall communicate to each 
other many things, which, however interesting, must be 
very sparingly trusted to paper. The necessity of this 
caution has imposed upon us a long and painful reserve, for 
between friends, few things are more agreeable, as well as 
useful, than free and undisguised communications. This is 
a pleasure to which I have been greatly a stranger since I 
left America, and it is in that country only that I expect 
again to enjoy it. Experience has taught me reserve, but 
it has also taught me that with you it will he unnecessary. 
This is a pleasant idea, and my mind dwells upon it with 
great satisfaction. How few are there in this world, my 
dear Kate, capable of a firm, uniform attachment; much 
fewer, I assure you, than I once thought: but youth is 
credulous, and consequently must be often disappointed. 
I hope my disappointments are nearly at an end ; for I expect very little, except from you and a few others. 
</p><p>
I have letters from Sally almost every week. Thank 
God, she continues well. She tells me our little girls grow 
charming]}'. My absence from her has been much longer 
than I expected. On coming to London, I w T as taken ill of 
a dysentery, and afterward, with a sore throat. Some 
remains of the latter still trouble me. Upon the wdiole, 
however, I am better, and the waters of this place have 
done me good. I propose next week to return to London, 
and from thence make the best of my way to France. I 
am impatient to be with my little family, and to have my 
sweet little girls upon my knee, while their mother tells me 
the domestic occurrences which have happened in my absence. Believe me to be, with great and sincere regard,

Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 21st of January was delivered to me 
this morning. It is painful to say disagreeable things to 
any person, and especially to those with whom one has lived 
in habits of friendship ; but candour on this subject forbids 
reserve. You was of the number of those who possessed 
my esteem, and to whom I was attached. To me, personally, you have never given offence ; but, on the contrary, I 
am persuaded you sincerely wished me well, and was disposed to do me good offices. 
</p><p>
The card you left for me at <a href='/results.php?tla=wib' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Bingham</a>'s, and also the 
letter you mention, were both delivered to me ; and I cannot express the regret I experienced from the cruel necessity 
I thought myself under, of passing them over in silence ; 
but I love my country and my honour better than my friends, 
and even my family, and am ready to part with them all 
whenever it would be improper to retain them. You are 
either exceedingly injured, or you are no friend to America ; 
and while doubts remain on that point, all connexion 
between us must be suspended. I wished to hear what 
you might have to say on that head, and should have named 
a time and place for an interview, had not an insurmountable 
obstacle intervened to prevent it. I was told by more than 
one, on whose information I thought I could rely, that you 
received visits from, and was on terms of familiarity with 
<a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a>. Every American who gives his hand to 
that man, in my opinion, pollutes it. 
</p><p>
I think it my duty to deal thus candidly with you, and I 
assure you, with equal sincerity, that it would give me cordial satisfaction to find you able to acquit yourself in the 
judgment of the dispassionate and impartial. If it is in 
your power to do it, I think you do yourself injustice by 
not undertaking that necessary task. That you may perform it successfully, whenever you undertake it, is the

Dear Morris, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 25th September came to my hands in 
England on the 8th December last ; and since my return, 
I have received that of the 7th November, which, though 
containing only three lines, I prefer to most of the others. 
Perhaps you have forgot it. 
</p><p>
" It is now within three minutes of the time when the 
mail is made up and sent off. I cannot, therefore, do more 
than just to assure you of the continuance of my love, 
Adieu. Yours, 
</p><p>
"G. M." 
</p><p>
That this letter was so short, I ascribe to procrastination ; that it was written at all, I ascribe to your heart : 
your head evidently had no concern in it ; for, if consulted, 
it would have intimated that they who live near a postoffice, find no good excuse for singular brevity in the mail's 
being to be sent off in a few minutes after they sit down to 
write, unless, indeed, some circumstance just occurred should 
make the subject of the letter. But, be that as it may, I 
would rather receive one little effusion from your heart 
than twenty from your head, though I hope to derive much 
pleasure from both. We shall have much to say to each 
other, and I think both of us will be gainers by it. Why I 
think so, must not be discussed in letters, whose seals will 
not be respected. 
</p><p>
You suppose that ill health induces me to resign. You 
are mistaken. It seldom happens that any measure is 
prompted by one single motive, though one among others 
may sometimes have decisive weight and influence. Many 
motives induce me to resign ; but of those many there is 
one which predominates, and that is this : — When I embarked in the public service, I said very sincerely that I 
quitted private life with regret, and should be happy to 
return to it when the objects which called me from it should 
be attained. You know what those objects were, and that, 
on the peace, they ceased to operate. To be consistent, 
therefore, I must retire. The motive is irresistible. Superadded to this are the education of my son, the attention I 
owe to the unfortunate part of my family, and the happiness I expect from rejoining my friends. Pecuniary considerations ever held a secondary place in my estimation. 1 
know how to live within the limits of any income, however 
narrow ; and my pride is not of a nature to be hurt by 
returning to the business which I formerly followed : but 
professions of this sort are common, and facts only can give 
unequivocal evidence of their sincerity. 
</p><p>
I have passed between three and four sad months in 
England. Bad weather and bad health almost the whole 
time. On my arrival, a dysentery and fever brought me 
low, and a sore-throat, which still plagues me, succeeded. 
Bath has done me good, for it removed the pain in my 
breast, which has been almost constant for eighteen months. 
</p><p>
I had many excellent opportunities of writing to my 
friends from London and Bristol, but I was enjoined to 
abstain as much as possible from pen and ink. 
</p><p>
It is natural that you should expect to find some news in 
this letter. I will tell you a little, though it is probable that 
your sagacity has prevented its being unexpected. The 
institution of the Order of Cincinnatus does not, in the 
opinion of the wisest men whom I have heard speak on the 
subject, either do credit to those who formed and patronised, 
or to those who suffered it. 
</p><p>
I am indebted to our excellent friend, Robert Morris, for 
a very obliging letter. He shall soon hear from me. In 
the mean time, let him share with you in this adieu. 
</p><p>
Yours sincerely, 
</p><p>

My good Friend, 
</p><p>
Your favour of the 4th November last found me in England, where, though I suffered much sickness, I left the pain 
in my breast ; but a sore throat I caught there still remains 
obstinate and troublesome. 
</p><p>
The resolution of Congress of 1st October last, did not 
reach me until in December. On my return here last 
month, I wrote in pursuance of it to Mr. Carmichael to 
come here without delay with the books and vouchers. I 
daily expect to hear from him, and shall be happy to see 
that business settled before I embark, which I hope will be 
in April, but from or to what port, and in what vessel, is as 
yet uncertain. 
</p><p>
There is no doubt but that you have had much to struggle 
with, and will have more. Difficulties must continue inseparable from your office for some time yet, and they will 
be the means either of increasing or diminishing your reputation. In my opinion you must go on. Success generally 
attends talents and perseverance, and these thorns will in 
due season probably bear flowers, if not fruit. 
</p><p>
There are parts of your letter, on which, though I concur with you in sentiment, I forbear to make remarks, 
because this may not pass to you uninspected. I hope we 
shall meet in the course of a few months more, and then 
reserve will cease to be necessary. 
</p><p>
What you say of <a href='/results.php?tla=gom' rel='colleague friend met'>Gouverneur</a> accords with my opinion 
of him. I have never broken the bands of friendship in 
my life, nor when once broken, have I ever been anxious 
to mend them. Mine with him will, I hope, last as long as 
we do, for though my sentiments of mankind in general are 
less favourable than formerly, my affection for certain individuals is as warm and cordial as ever. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Jay presents her affectionate compliments to you 
and Mrs. Morris, to whom we join in sincerely wishing all 
the happiness with which amiable merit should be ever 
blessed. Tell <a href='/results.php?tla=gom' rel='colleague friend met'>Gouverneur</a> I long to take him by the hand, 
and believe me to be, my dear sir, 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The violence of your political storm seems to have abated, 
but I should not be surprised if you should frequently have 
March weather. 
</p><p>
Accounts from America lead me to suspect that your 
commercial negotiations with us will not be facilitated by 
delay ; and I should not be surprised if a system should 
then be adopted, which would render European proclamations of very little importance to that country. It appears 
more probable that England will outwit herself. There is 
a tide in human affairs which, like other tides, turns only 
to run in an opposite direction. 
</p><p>
I am preparing to go to New-York by the first good 
vessel that may sail for that port. I more than wish to see 
you there. They who know the nature of man expect perfection nowhere. There are certain degrees in refinement 
and arts, which are more favourable than others to those 
principles and manners which wise men prefer. In this, as 
well as in some other circumstances, we have the advantage 
of other countries. Various causes conspire to give every 
man his weight, and I believe the old maxim of " quisque 
sues faber est fortunes? has fewer exceptions in America 
than elsewhere. They who bring with them ideas borrowed from the regions of fancy and romance will be disappointed. The golden age will not cease to be a fable 
until the millennium ; until that period for separating life 
from death, pleasure from pain, virtue from vice, and 
wisdom from folly, every society and country will continue 
to partake more or less of the heterogeneous and discordant 
principles, which seem to be the seeds both of moral and 
natural evil. 
</p><p>
Were I in your situation, I would see for myself, and 
then determine. To avoid mistakes, it is necessary to see 
things as being what they really are. Minutias are often 
omitted, or imperfectly drawn in representations. Great 
part of the good within our reach depend on minutiae ; they 
merit more attention than many apprehend. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to present my respectful compliments to Lord 
and Lady Shelburne. I hope his gout has left him. Remember me also to our patriot friend, Doctor Price. 
</p><p>
Adieu my dear sir,

Dear Sir. 
</p><p>
I had last evening the pleasure of receiving your favour 
of the 27th ult. I congratulate you on your safe arrival, 
and sincerely wish that the same good fortune may attend 
your return. 
</p><p>
While our country remained part of the. British empire, 
there was no impropriety in soliciting the <i'u{ ol our distant 
brethren and fellow-subjects for any liberal and public purposes. It was natural that the younger branches of the 
political family should request and accept the assistance of 
the elder. But as the United States neither have, nor can 
have, such relations with any nations in the world ; as the 
rank they hold and ought to assert, implies ability to provide 
for ail the ordinary objects of their government ; and as the 
diffusion of knowledge among a republican people, is and 
ought to be one of the constant and most important of those 
objects, I cannot think it consistent with the dignity of a 
free and independent people, to solicit donations for that or 
any other purpose, from the subjects of any prince or state 
whatever. 
</p><p>
The public, with us, are, in my opinion, so deeply interested in the education of our citizens, that universities, &c, 
ought no longer to be regarded in the light of mere private 
corporations. The government should extend to them their 
constant care ; and the State treasuries afford them necessary supplies. 
</p><p>
The success which might attend such applications in this 
country, can only be matter of conjecture. The raising 
money by subscription has not been so customary in France 
as in Britain, and my opinion is, that you would collect 
very little. If indeed the court should set the example, 
and really wish to promote it, the thing would then become 
fashionable ; and I am inclined to think that even the fashion 
of giving would have a great run for a few weeks. As to 
books, the consideration that every American student, who 
in a long lapse of years might open those books, would read 
the name of the donor, added to the vanity of authors, and 
others who may be zealous to extend the reputation of 
French literature, would probably procure you some. As 
to apparatus, the best instruments and machines are made 
in England ; and the greater, as well as better part of those 
used here, are, I am told, brought from thence. I am much 
mistaken if Europe, in general, does not wish that we were 
less knowing than we are already. But if it was probable 
that such applications would be attended with ever so great 
success, yet as I think they can be properly made only in 
the United States, I could not prevail upon myself to advise 
the experiment. 
</p><p>
If, however, you should visit Paris, I assure you it will 
give me great pleasure to see you, and to be instrumental 
in rendering it agreeable to you. We have been fellowlabourers in the same field, and if you come, we will rejoice 
together in celebrating " harvest home." 
</p><p>
With respect to the disagreeable voyage in which your 
son shared with us, 1 won't say jubes renovare dolorem, 
because I am habituated to reflect on events of that sort 
with tranquillity. It was one of those, however, which 
tried all who were concerned in it ; and I must do your 
son the justice to say, that none of us preserved more equanimity and good-humour throughout the whole than he did, 
and he had a full share of unpleasant circumstances, as 
well as some others of us. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant,

My good Friend, 
</p><p>
It gave me pleasure to receive your obliging letter of the 
30th December, and the more so, as the one to Sally which 
accompanies it contains agreeable accounts of your health. 
Accept my thanks for the kind wishes which the season 
gave you occasion to offer. In your sincerity I have full 
confidence ; and in your happiness, I feel that interest 
which long-confirmed esteem and attachment never fails to 
create. 
</p><p>
If the ensuing summer should bring us all together in 
health and spirits, I shall think the day of my arrival one 
of the most fortunate of my life. After having passed so 
many years in scenes of trouble and difficulty of various 
kinds, I look forward with emotion not to be described to 
that peaceful circle of my friends and family, where I again 
expect to meet the enjoyments which have so long deserted 
me. God only knows what futurity may have in store for 
us, or what adverse events may still continue to teach us 
lessons of resignation. It is happy for us, however, that 
hope is our constant companion, and that new expectations 
constantly succeed the disappointment of preceding ones. 
</p><p>
Having expected that Mr. Carmichael would have arrived 
with the public accounts in time to have them settled 
before the A] nil packet engaged her passengers, I had 
taken steps for going in her ; but he did not reach Paris till 
the 27th ult., and Mr. Barclay, who is to settle them, being 
then and still absent, I must necessarily be detained here 
till in May. I hope, but am not sure, that I shall then embark. In matters which do not depend upon myself, or 
people like you, I dare not be sanguine. Such of our baggage as is not in immediate use, is already packed up. 
</p><p>
Your accounts of my dear boy please me. Tell him his 
endeavours to gain knowledge, and practise virtue, will 
increase and secure my affection for him. 
</p><p>
Remember me to all the family ; and believe me to be,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On the 5th inst. Mr, Norris gave me your obliging letter 
of the 2Cth September last. I regret that he did not come 
here sooner, for it will always give me pleasure to have 
opportunities of evincing my esteem and regard for you, 
by attention to those who possess yours. Mr. Carmichael, 
whom I had long expected with the public accounts, did 
not arrive until the 27th ult. ; when Mr. Ridley had just 
gone to England, and Mr. Barclay, who had been long there, was and still is absent. Nothing but the settlement of 
those accounts now detains me here, and a mortifying detention it is, considering that the best season for being at sea 
is passing away. While I stay, Mr. Norris shall perceive 
that he could have brought few recommendations to me so 
acceptable as yours, and those amiable qualities for which 
you commend him. I wish he may return as uncorrupted 
as he came. Paris is a place better calculated for the improvement of riper years ; and in my opinion, very young 
men should not visit it. Our country has already sent 
some here, who will return the worse for their travels. I 
hope your young friend may escape. If he should, you 
may congratulate him on having made the choice of Hercules, for he will be tempted. On the 1st instant, I received 
your favour of January last, by Colonel Harmar. J flatter 
myself that the delays attending the ratification of the 
treaty will not occasion difficulties ; especially as one of the 
ministers who made the peace is now at the head of the 
British administration. If European commercial restrictions produce unanimity, and tend to raise a national spirit 
in our country, which probably will be the case, I shall 
think them blessings. It is time for us to think and act like 
a sovereign, as well as a free people, and by temperate and 
steady self-respect to command that of other nations. It is 
but too much the fashion to depreciate Congress, and I fear 
that, as well as many other of our new fashions, will cost 
us dear. 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The far greater part of my time since my arrival has 
been passed in the country, so that several vessels have 
lately gone to Europe, without letters from me to our 
friends there. 
</p><p>
The health of my family and myself is better than usual, 
and I begin to flatter myself that if you and Mrs. Vaughan 
could enjoy this country in only half the degree that I do, 
you would not greatly regret leaving Old England. I am 
more contented than I expected. Some tilings, it is true, 
are wrong, but more are right. Justice is well administered, offences are rare, and I have never known more 
public tranquillity or private security. Resentments subside very sensibly, though gradually. I have met with 
whigs and tories at the same table. The spirit of industry 
throughout the country was never greater. The productions of the earth abound. Prices have fallen since my 
arrival, though still much higher than formerly, especially 
the wages of mechanics and labourers, which are very extravagant. House-rent is more than double what it was 
before the war.

A sufficient number of members to form a Congress not 
having arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, I passed on to this place ten 
days ago, to visit my friends. I found your family well, 
and am happy in this opportunity of cultivating their acquaintance. 
</p><p>
Your obliging letter of the 5th August lately came to 
hand. Accept my thanks for it, and for the pamphlets 
enclosed with it. 
</p><p>
The policy of Britain respecting this country is so repugnant to common sense, that I am sometimes tempted to 
think it must be so ; and the old adage of quos Deus, &c, 
always occurs to me when I reflect on the subject. 
</p><p>
The India business never appeared to me a difficult one. 
</p><p>
Do justice, and all is easy. Cease to treat those unhappy 
nations as slaves, and be content to trade with them as with 
other independent kingdoms. On such an event, advantageous though fair treaties might be made with them, and 
you might leave, with their consent, force sufficient in circumscribed limits, to secure the benefit and observance of 
them. Your tribute, indeed, would be at an end, but it 
ought not to have had a beginning ; and I wish it may ever 
prove a curse to those who impose and exact it in any 
country. 
</p><p>
Our affairs are in such a state as, all circumstances considered, might naturally have been expected ; far better 
than many represent them, though not so well as they 
ought to be. 
</p><p>
Congress is convened at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, and I join them tomorrow. In the course of six or eight weeks a judgment may

</p><p>
It is certain that we are trading at a wild rate ; and it is 
no less true that your people are giving most absurd credits 
to many, who neither have or ought to have any at home. 
This delirium cannot last. Adieu, my dear sir.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It was not before this morning that I was informed that 
the bearer of this letter was going to France, and to sail tomorrow ; and business and company have not till now (late 
in the evening), permitted me to sit down to write to you. 
I cannot, however, omit this opportunity of sending you a 
few lines, which, though not very interesting, will nevertheless evince my attention to a correspondence, from which 
I promise myself much pleasure as well as much information. 
</p><p>
The removal of Congress to this place necessarily occasioned a suspension of business, and delayed their maturing 
several matters which they had under consideration. They 
have, within a few days past, made a house, and as they 
possess both talents and temper, there is reason to presume that the Union will derive advantage from their 
measures. 
</p><p>
Advices from Kentucky inform us that they are threatened 
with an Indian war ; and there is some room to conjecture 
that such an event would not be disagreeable to our western 
neighbours, who, if they do interfere, will certainly be more 
cunning than wise. That settlement increases with a degree 
of rapidity heretofore unknown in this country, and increase 
it will, notwithstanding any attempt of anybody to prevent it. 
</p><p>
Federal ideas begin to thrive in this city, and I suspect 
in a few days to communicate to you a circumstance which 
will strongly manifest it. 
</p><p>
Although we cannot be immediately interested in the 
war, which it is thought will take place between the emperor 
and the Dutch, yet we may be affected by its consequences, 
and, therefore, must wish to know who will, and who will 
not, probably take sides with this or that party, in case of a 
rupture. 
</p><p>
Have we any reason to flatter ourselves that you will 
encourage us to drink your wines, by permitting your islands 
to eat our bread ? or will Bordeaux (as is said) constrain 
Versailles to patronise a provincial monopoly at the expense 
of a more liberal policy ? Commercial privileges, granted 
to us by France, at this season of British ill-humour, would 
be particularly grateful; and afford conclusive evidence 
against its being the plan of the two kingdoms to restrain 
our trade to the islands. You know how uneasy we are 
under these restraints, and we confide fully in your exertions 
to remove them. I write very freely, but you are my fellow-citizen, and therefore it does not appear to me necessary to attempt to dress my ideas a la mode de Paris. 
Believe me to be, dear sir,

Sir, 
</p><p>
Such has been the state of my official business, and of 
that which arose from my long neglected private affairs, 
that, ever since the removal of Congress to this place, I 
have been obliged to trespass on my usual punctuality in 
private correspondences. Hence it happened that I have 
so long denied myself the pleasure of replying to your 
friendly letter of the 10th of January. Accept my warmest 
acknowledgments for the kind and very obliging manner in 
which you mention my services abroad, and permit me to 
congratulate you on the success of the application to Congress on behalf of Dickinson College, which you appear 
zealously to patronise. I consider knowledge to be the 
soul of a republic ; and as the weak and the wicked are 
generally in alliance, as much care should be taken to 
diminish the number of the former, as of the latter. Education is the way to do this, and nothing should be left 
undone to afford all ranks of people the means of obtaining 
a proper degree of it, at a cheap and easy rate. 
</p><p>
I thank you for the pamphlet you sent me. There is 
good sense and just reasoning in it. I wish to see all unjust 
and unnecessary discriminations everywhere abolished; 
and that the time may soon come when all our inhabitants, 
of every colour and denomination, shall be free and equal 
partakers of our political liberty.

the high sense the United States, in Congress assembled, 
entertain of the liberal decision made by his Danish majesty, on the question proposed to his minister by you, 
respecting the ordination of American candidates for holy 
orders in the Episcopal church, commonly called the Church 
of England. 
</p><p>
Congress has been pleased to order me to transmit copies 
of your letter, and the other papers on this subject, to the 
executives of the different States ; and I am persuaded 
they will receive with pleasure this mark of your attention, 
and of his Danish majesty's friendly disposition.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I received last evening the two letters you did me the 
honour to write on the 8th February last, and congratulate 
you sincerely on the birth of your grandson. 
</p><p>
I have accepted the office which Congress was pleased 
to offer me, and shall be much obliged to vou for such intelligence from time to time as you may think useful for me 
to receive, and prudent for you to communicate. As a 
public man, I shall always remember your attachment and 
services to the United States ; and as a private one, it will 
always give me pleasure to acknowledge the friendly attention which has so long marked your conduct towards me 
and my family. In both capacities, therefore, I shall be 
happy to give you better evidence of my esteem and 
regard, than compliments or professions can possibly 
afford. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Morris</a>'s resignation is a great loss to this country, 
and yet I am not without hopes that the department of 
finance will become properly arranged. The nature of our 
governments, as well as the circumstance of their being 
new, exposes our operations to delay, and renders the best 
systems slow in forming, as well as slow in executing. In 
my opinion, one superintendent or commissioner of the 
treasury is preferable to any greater number of them ; 
indeed, I would rather have each department under the 
direction of one able man, than of twenty able ones. All 
things, however, in this world, have their bright as well as 
their dark sides ; and there are few systems so imperfect 
as not to have some conveniences. Many reasons induce 
me to disapprove of committing the treasury to the management of three persons ; and yet one very great convenience 
results from it, viz., that our jealous republicans will have 
more confidence in three gentlemen coming from different 
parts of the continent, than they would place in any one 
single man. Confidence, you know, is always followed by 
credit, and credit is the forerunner of money.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been favoured with yours of the 12th February, 
containing a copy of one of 16th October last, for which 
accept my cordial thanks. 
</p><p>
Your observations in France, respecting a certain event, 
coincide exactly with what I expected on that subject. Indeed, the many interesting remarks spread through your 
letter appear to me to have weight. 
</p><p>
Our last accounts give us reason to suppose there will 
be no war between the emperor and the Dutch, so that the 
continuance of a general peace begins again to appear 
probable. 
</p><p>
Our frontier posts still have British garrisons, and we are 
impatient to hear why they are not. evacuated. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Adams</a>, 
I suppose, is by this time in London ; his letters will remove 
our suspense on that head. 
</p><p>
The African states have alarmed us, but we hope peace 
with them may be obtained. Your attention to that subject 
is commendable, and you may do good by communicating 
the result of your inquiries to <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Adams</a>. 
</p><p>
Our affairs are settling by degrees into order. If power 
be given by Congress to regulate trade, and provide for the 
payment of their debts, all will be well. Difficulties on 
those points still exist, but federal ideas daily gain ground. 
The people of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> resent British restrictions ; and if 
the same spirit should become general, it will probably influence the States to enable Congress to retaliate, and extend their powers accordingly. 
</p><p>
The Empress of China has made a fortunate voyage ; 
and it is said many are preparing to embark in that commerce. The spirit of enterprise and adventure runs high 
in our young country, and if properly directed by a vigorous 
and wise federal government, would produce great effects. 
</p><p>
A rage for emigrating to the western country prevails, 
and thousands have already fixed their habitations in that 
wilderness. The Continental Land Office is opened, and the seeds of a great people are daily planting beyond the mountains. 
</p><p>
Make my best compliments to Mrs. Bingham ; and believe me to be, dear sir, with great esteem and regard,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for your interesting letter of the 19th 
March, which was immediately communicated to Congress. 
I consider it as a new proof of that constant and useful 
attention to our affairs, from which the United States have 
so often derived both pleasure and advantage. Let me 
request the continuance of your correspondence, and be 
assured that it will always give me pleasure to communicate to you such intelligence respecting American occurrences as may appear interesting. 
</p><p>
Don Diego Gardoqui is arrived, and has been received 
so much in the spirit of friendship, that 1 hope his master 
and himself will be well pleased. Our negotiations with 
him will soon commence, and I sincerely wish that the 
issue of them may be satisfactory to both countries. To 
prepare for war, and yet be tenacious of peace with all the 
wwld, is, I think, our true interest. I wish Mr. Gardoqui's 
instructions may be sufficiently extensive to admit of a settlement of our boundaries, &c, on principles which alone 
can create and perpetuate cordiality. 
</p><p>
The British show no disposition to evacuate our frontier 
posts. What their real designs are, can at present be only 
inferred and conjectured from appearances ; and present 
appearances induce a suspicion that they mean to hold 
them. The letters we expect from <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Adams</a> will probably remove all doubts on that head. It is certain that 
they pay great attention to the Indians, and give great encouragement to emigrants from us. Their expectations 
from the latter circumstance will fail them. I wish that 
every acre of ground they hold in America was settled by 
natives of the United States. They would transplant their 
love of liberty, their spirit of enterprise, and their attachment to republicanism into countries in which it is our 
interest that such plants should be propagated and flourish ; 
in time they will bear fruit. 
</p><p>
The commercial class of our people sensibly feel the 
restraints on our trade, and look up to Congress for a 
remedy. Good will come out of evil ; these discontents 
nourish federal ideas. As trade diminishes, agriculture 
must suffer ; and hence it will happen that our yeomen will 
be as desirous of increasing the powers of Congress, as our 
merchants now are. All foreign restrictions, exclusions, and 
unneighbourly ordinances will tend to press us together, 
and strengthen our bands of union. 
</p><p>
I send you herewith a number of gazettes, from which 
you will discern something of the spirit which prevails. 
</p><p>
Congress go on doing business with great concord, 
temper, and harmony. I enclose a copy of the ordinance 
for regulating the Land Office. They are now on the subject of requisitions ; and I flatter myself, that as the highest 
respect for good faith prevails in the House, that exertions 
will be made by the States to preserve the public credit. 
</p><p>
Governor Livingston was appointed for the Hague, but 
declining that place, <a href='/results.php?tla=ewr' rel='colleague met friend'>Gov. Rutledge</a> has been elected for it. 
His answer has not yet reached.

When, my dear sir, will your court send us a minister ? 
Our having one at Versailles, affords reason to expect one 
from thence. The report of Mons. De Montiers coming 
over in that capacity dies away. From the little I saw of 
him in Paris, I am inclined to think he would be an agreeable, as well as an able minister.

</p><p>
Madam, 
</p><p>
I have received the letter which you did me the honour 
to write on the 15th April last. Few circumstances could 
have given me more pleasure than such evidence of my 
having a place in the remembrance and good opinion of a 
ladv, whose esteem derives no less value from her discernment, than from the delicacy of her sentiments. 
</p><p>
Accept therefore, madam, of my sincere and cordial 
acknowledgments for honouring me with a place among 
your correspondents ; which was the more obliging, as you 
was to afford more pleasure by, than you could expect to 
receive from it. You know it is an old observation, that 
ladies write better letters than gentlemen, and therefore, 
independent of other considerations, a correspondence between them is always so far on unequal terms. 
</p><p>
I can easily conceive that you, whose predilection for 
your husband was always conspicuous, should experience 
so much satisfaction on seeing him return from this, his field 
of glory, with additional honours ; and I can, with equal 
ease, form an idea of his emotions, when on that, as on 
former occasions, those honours promoted him to higher 
rank in your estimation. 
</p><p>
Your remarks on the marquis's affection for his children, 
and the value you set on domestic enjoyments, must be 
pleasing to those who are capable of feeling their force. 
</p><p>
I assure you I rejoice in the prospect you have of extending, through your branch, the reputation of both your 
families ; and you have my best wishes, that the latest historian may say of your descendants, that all the men were 
as valiant and worthy as their ancestor, who will probably 
be distinguished by the appellation of Americanus, and all 
the women as virtuous and amiable as his lady. 
</p><p>
If you was not what you are, I would not encourage the 
desire you express of accompanying the marquis on his 
next visit to this country, for I am sure you would be disappointed. 
</p><p>
We have few amusements to relieve travellers of that 
weight of time and leisure which oppresses many of them. 
Our men, for the most part, mind their business, and our 
women their families ; and if our wives succeed (as most 
of them do) in " making home man's best delight," gallantry 
seldom draws their husbands from them. 
</p><p>
Our customs, in many respects, differ from yours, and 
you know that, whether with or without reason, we usually 
prefer those which education and habit recommend. The 
pleasures of Paris and the pomp of Versailles are unknown 
in this country, and their votaries must unavoidably experience a certain vacuity or blank here, which nothing but 
good sense, moderate desires, and a relish for less splendid, 
less various, but not less innocent or satisfactory enjoyments 
can supply. Though not a Frenchman, I should, nevertheless, be too polite to tell these things to those whom they 
might restrain from visiting us. Cn you they will have a 
contrary effect. It would gratify the friends of the marquis, viz., the citizens of the United States, to have the 
honour of a visit from you. I flatter myself that consideration will afford a strong additional inducement. 
</p><p>
My little family is well. Mrs. Jay desires me to assure 
you of her remembrance and regard ; and permit me to 
add, that I am, with sincere esteem and respectful attachment, 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The frequent solecisms, observable for some years past 
in the politics of the court of London, render it exceedingly 
difficult to divine how they will think and act under almost 
any given circumstances. 
</p><p>
It is manifestly as much their interest to be well with us, 
as it is ours to be well with them ; and yet the gratification 
of resentments, occasioned by disappointment, seems to take 
the lead of more elevated and useful principles of action. 
</p><p>
They expect much from the trade of America, and yet 
they take pains to cut off every source within their reach 
by which we may make remittances. It is strange that 
they should wish us to buy, and yet be so industrious to put 
it out of our power to pay. Such a system must cause 
loss of money to their merchants, and loss of reputation to 
ours. I wish most sincerely that credit was at an end, and 
that we could purchase nothing abroad but for ready 
money. Our exportations would then be equally profitable, 
and as our importations would be diminished, we should 
have less to pay. Domestic manufactures would then be 
more encouraged, and frugality and economy become more 
prevalent. 
</p><p>
What impression the conduct of Captain Stanhope may 
make on the minister, to me appears uncertain. Certain 
however it is, that mutual civility and respect must, in the 
nature of things, precede mutual benevolence and kindness. 
The manner of your reception and treatment indicates 
their attention to this consideration, and yet the detention 
of the posts, the strengthening their garrisons in our neighbourhood, the encouragement said to be given to settlers in 
those parts, and various other circumstances speak a language very different from that of kindness and good-will. 
They may hold the posts, but they will hold them as 
pledges of enmity ; and the time must and will come, 
when the seeds of discontent, resentment, and hatred, 
which such measures always sow, will produce very bitter 
fruit. 
</p><p>
I am well informed that some of the loyalists advise and 
warmly press the detention of the posts. It is strange that 
men, who for ten years have done nothing but deceive, 
should still retain any credit. I speak of them collectively, 
among them there are men of merit : but to my knowledge 
some of the most violent, the most bitter and implacable, 
and yet most in credit, are men who endeavoured to play 
between both parties, and vibrated from side to side as the 
appearance of success attracted them. Nay, the very 
accounts of losses which many of them have presented, 
afford conclusive evidence of their inattention to truth and 
common decency. Such, however, has been the infatuation 
of British counsels, that what was manifest to others, was 
problematical, if not entirely dark to them. 
</p><p>
As to their present minister, he has neither been long 
enough in administration, nor perhaps in the world, for a 
decided judgment to be formed either of his private or 
public character. He seems to possess firmness as well as 
abilities ; and if to these be added information, and comprehensive as well as patriotic views, he may be worthy of 
his father. England will probably be either much the better, or much the worse for him. 
</p><p>
We are anxious to receive letters from you on the subject of the posts, that in either event we may be prepared. 
In the one case, I should think it very justifiable in Congress to take a certain step, that would be longer and more 
sensibly felt by Britain than the independence of these 
States.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I hope my letter, in answer to the one which enclosed a 
number of your political pamphlets, has reached you by this 
time. I do not recollect the date, but it went in one of the 
last vessels. 
The cause of liberty, like most other good causes, will 
have its difficulties, and sometimes its persecutions, to 
struggle with. It has advanced more rapidly in this than 
other countries, but all its objects are not yet attained ; and 
I much doubt whether they ever will be, in this or any 
other terrestrial state. That men should pray and fight for 
their own freedom, and yet keep others in slavery, is certainly acting a very inconsistent, as well as unjust and, 
perhaps, impious part ; but the history of mankind is filled 
with instances of human improprieties. The wise and the 
good never form the majority of any large society, and it 
seldom happens that their measures are uniformly adopted ; 
or that they can always prevent being overborne themselves 
by the strong and almost never-ceasing union of the wicked 
and the weak. 
</p><p>
These circumstances tell us to be patient, and to moderate 
those sanguine expectations, which warm and good hearts 
often mislead even wise heads to entertain on those subjects. 
All that the best men can do is, to persevere in doing their 
duty to their country, and leave the consequences to Him 
who made it their duty ; being neither elated by success, 
however great, nor discouraged by disappointments however frequent and mortifying. 
</p><p>
With sincere esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your grandson, whom it gave me great pleasure to see, 
delivered to me a few days ago your kind letter of the 21st 
of last month. Your being again with your family, the 
manner in which the French court parted with you, the 
attention you experienced from your English friends, and 
the reception you met with from your fellow-citizens, are 
circumstances that must give you great satisfaction. 
</p><p>
It strikes me that you will find it somewhat difficult to 
manage the two parties in Pennsylvania. It is much to be 
wished that union and harmony may be established there, 
and if you accomplish it. much honour and many blessings 
will result from it. Unless you do it, I do not know who 
can ; for, independent of experience and talents, you possess 
their confidence, and your advice and measures must derive 
very great weight from the reputation and consideration 
you enjoy. 
</p><p>
We are happy to find that you think of visiting NewYork. By the road from Burlington and Amboy, which is 
smooth and but short, you might doubtless come with very 
little inconvenience ; especially as you may travel at your 
leisure, and take as many days for it as your ease and the 
weather may require. Mrs. Jay is exceedingly pleased 
with this idea, and sincerely joins with me in wishing to see 
it realized. Her attachments are strong, and that to you, 
being founded in esteem and the recollection of kind offices, 
is particularly so. I suspect your little friend has forgotten 
your person. Your name is familiar to her, as, indeed, it 
will be to every generation.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since the date of my last to you, which was the 6th September last, I have been honoured with yours of the 10th 
and 26th June, and 19th and 29th July, with the papers 
mentioned to be enclosed. They are now before Congress, 
and I am persuaded that the strong marks they bear of 
industry and attention will give them pleasure. 
I perfectly concur with you in sentiment respecting what 
ought to be the conduct and policy of the United States, 
and I am not without hopes that they will gradually perceive and pursue their true interests. There certainly is 
much temper as well as talents in Congress ; and although 
it is not in their power to do all that should be done, yet 
they are willing and industrious to do whatever depends 
upon them. 
</p><p>
Your letters, I am sure, are useful. They disseminate 
and enforce those federal ideas which cannot be too forcibly inculcated, or too strongly impressed. Our federal government is incompetent to its objects ; and as it is the interest of our country, so it is the duty of her leading characters to co-operate in measures for enlarging and invigorating it. The rage for separations and new States is mischievous ; it will, unless checked, scatter our resources, and 
in every view enfeeble the Union. Your testimony against 
such licentious, anarchical proceedings would, I am persuaded, have great weight. 
</p><p>
Your letters, as yet, are silent respecting the evacuation 
of our frontier posts. I do not mean to press you either to 
do or say any thing unseasonably about it ; for there are 
times and tides in human affairs to be watched and observed. 
I know vour attention, and therefore rest satisfied that we 
shall hear from you on this interesting subject as soon as 
you ought to write about it. During the ensuing sessions 
of the Legislatures, I shall watch their acts, and endeavour 
to send you such as may respect the interests of the Union. 
I find it extremely difficult to collect them. When I first 
came into this office, I wrote a circular letter to the governors, requesting them, among other things, to send me, 
from time to time, printed copies of their acts ; but, whatever may have been the cause, it has so happened that, 
except in two or three instances, this request has been 
entirelv neglected. 
</p><p>
With the newspapers herewith sent, you will find the requisition of Congress. What its success will be cannot yet be determined. 
</p><p>
Tim Algerines, it seems, have declared war against us. 
If we act properly, I shall not be wry sorry for it. In my 
opinion, it may lay the foundation for a navy, and tend to 
draw ns more closely into a federal system. Onthatground 
only we wain strength; and could our people be brought 
to see it in that light, ami act accordingly, we should have 
little reason to apprehend danger from any quarter. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a> is happy at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. Both parties are 
assiduous in their attentions to him, and it is thought more 
than probable that he will succeed Mr. Dickinson. I fear, 
in the language of our farmers, that a day so remarkably 
fine for the season may prove a weather-breeder : that is, 
that he will find it difficult to manage both parties; for if 
he gives himself up to one, he must expect hostility from the 
other. I wish he may be able to reconcile them, and thereby 
restore that State to the degree of strength and respectability which, from its population, fertility, and commerce, it 
ought to possess.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last to you was of the 14th ult., by the ship Betsey, 
Captain Thomas Watson. Since that time, I have had the 
pleasure of receiving and laying before Congress your 
despatches of the 6th, 8th, and 10th August last. 
</p><p>
We concur so perfectly in sentiment respecting public 
affairs, and what ought to be done, that I find no occasion 
to enlarge on those heads. 
</p><p>
In a late report, I have called the attention of Congress 
to this serious question, viz. whether the United States 
should withdraw their attention from the ocean, and leave 
foreigners to fetch and carry for them, or whether it is more 
their interest to look forward to naval strength and maritime importance, and to take and persevere in the measures 
proper to attain it. 
</p><p>
The diversity of opinions on this point renders it necessary that it should be well considered, and finally decided. 
The eastern and middle States are generally for the latter 
system ; and though the others do not openly avow their 
preferring the former, yet they are evidently inclined to it. 
Hence it is that the most leading men in Congress from 
that quarter do not only not promote measures for vesting 
Congress with power to regulate trade, but, as the common 
phrase is, throw cold water on all such ideas. 
</p><p>
Having few or no ships of their own, they are averse to 
such duties on foreign ones as will greatly advance the 
price of freight ; nor do they seem much disposed to sacrifice any present profits for the sake of their neighbours who 
have ships and wish to have more. 
</p><p>
We have heard much of the Alsrerines havinsr declared 
war against the United States. None of our advices are

Bordeaux, and L'Orient, there seems to be much reason to 
fear it is true.

The public papers herewith sent will inform you of our

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.

Sir, 
</p><p>
Mr. Temple presented to me this morning the commission which I have now the honour of transmitting to your 
excellency herewith enclosed. It appoints him consulgeneral of his Britannic majesty, throughout the United 
States of America. 
</p><p>
Two questions arise on this occasion : 
</p><p>
1. Whether he is to be received de jure. 
</p><p>
2. Whether it will be expedient to receive him de gratia. 
The first question is settled by Vattel in the following 
</p><p>
paragraph, viz., 
</p><p>
"Among the modern institutions," &c, page 131. 
</p><p>
The second question appears to me to be an important 
one, for however determined, interesting consequences will 
result from its decision. In considering it, a secondary 
question presents itself, viz. whether the rejection or reception of this consul will most dispose his nation to the terms 
of commercial intercourse which we wish. To this point, 
the fable of the north wind and the sun seems applicable. 
</p><p>
It appears to me that the admission of a consul here is 
not a matter of so much importance to Britain, as to induce 
that nation to purchase or obtain it by any compliances 
which they would not olherivisc make. Severity, or summum jus on small points, may irritate, but they very 
seldom coerce. Retaliatory restrictions on trade and navigation are great objects, and very consistent with the pride 
and dignity, as well as interest of a nation ; but under such 
ideas to refuse to receive a consul, would, whatever might 
be the true motives, be generally ascribed to a degree of 
pique and irritation, which, though nations may feel, they 
ought not expressly or impliedly to declare. 
</p><p>
In my opinion, therefore, this consul ought to be received, but in such a manner as to be and to appear as a matter 
of favour, and not ns a matter of course. 
I have the honour to be, 
</p><p>
Your excellency's most obedient 
</p><p>
And very humble servant,

Dear Sir. 
</p><p>
Since my last of 7th December last, and indeed for some 
time before that, Congress has been composed of so few 
States actually represented, as not to have it in their power 
to pay that attention to their foreign affairs which they 
would doubtless have otherwise' done. Hence it has happened that no resolutions have been entered into on any of 
the important subjects submitted to their consideration. 
This obliges me to observe a degree of reserve in my letters respecting those subjects, which I wish to be free from, 
but which is nevertheless necessary, lest my sentiments and 
opinions should be opposed to those which they may adopt 
and wish to impress. 
</p><p>
There is reason to hope that the requisition will be generally complied with ; I say generally, because it is not quite 
clear that every State without exception will make punctual payments. Although a disposition prevails to enable 
Congress to regulate trade, yet 1 am apprehensive, that 
however the propriety of the measure may be admitted, the manner of doing it will not be with equal ease 
agreed to. 
</p><p>
It is much to be regretted, that the confederation had not 
been so formed as to exclude the necessity of all such kind 
of questions. It certainly is very imperfect, and I fear it 
will be difficult to remedy its defects, until experience 
shall render the necessity of doing it more obvious and 
pressing.

Dear Sir,

Nine States are not yet represented in Congress, and 
therefore the affairs of this department continue in the 
same state that they were in at the date of my last. 
</p><p>
The public papers will enable you to see the complexion 
of the times. Federal opinions grow, but it will be some time 
befure they will bear fruit; and, what is not the case with 
most other fruits, they will, to judge from present appearances, ripen slower in the south than in the north.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been favoured with your letter of the 22d ult., 
and hnmediatelv communicated it to the committee of our 
society for promoting the liberation of slaves, and protecting such as may be manumitted. They are taking proper 
measures on the occasion, and I flatter myself that our 
Legislature will interpose to prevent such enormities in 
future. 
</p><p>
It is much to be wished that slavery may be abolished. 
The honour of the States, as well as justice and humanity, 
in my opinion, loudly call upon them to emancipate these 
unhappy people. To contend for our own liberty, and to 
deny that blessing to others, involves an inconsistency not 
to be excused. 
</p><p>
Whatever may be the issue of the endeavours of you 
and others to promote this desirable end, the reflection that 
they are prompted by the best motives affords good reasons 
for persevering in them.

My Lord, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the letter you did me the honour 
to write on the 4th September last, and for your obliging 
interposition in behalf of the person alluded to in it. 
</p><p>
Your lordship's conjectures respecting the new principles 
of trade and finance will probably be realized. We hear 
of several circumstances which look and promise well. 
The extent of those principles, and the system of commerce to be reared on them, are subjects, however, on 
which no decided judgment can here be formed, for want 
of information more minute and unquestionable than we at 
present have. 
</p><p>
Various, my lord, are the conjectures of this country respecting the real disposition and intentions of yours on these 
and some other interesting points. While such doubts and 
apprehensions exist, a degree of jealousy will naturally continue to operate against mutual confidence. For my part, 
I sincerely wish to see good-humour prepare the way for 
friendly intercourse, and by degrees incline both countries 
rather to promote than retard each other's welfare. It 
gives me pleasure to reflect that our wishes on this head 
correspond, and that the time may yet come when your 
abilities and liberality will produce all the public benefits 
which may justly he expected from them. Mr. Pitt's 
views, as to America, are yet to be ascertained : I wish 
they may be such as to increase the reputation and affection 
which his father's memory enjoys among us. It strikes me 
that a minister of any nation, much connected with this, 
will always find advantage in possessing the esteem and 
confidence of America. 
</p><p>
To what events this country may in future be instrumental, is indeed uncertain ; but I cannot persuade myself 
that <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> has created such a nation, in such a country, to remain like dust in the balance of others. We are 
happy, my lord, in the enjoyment of much more interior 
tranquillity than the English newspapers allow, or their 
writers seem to wish us. In free states, there must and 
ought to be a little ferment. When the public mind grows 
languid, and a dead calm, unmarked by the least breeze of 
party takes place, the vigour of a republic soon becomes 
lost in general relaxation. We perhaps are yet too distant 
from that point ; for although our laws and manners now 
give us as much personal security as can elsewhere be 
found, and although the same may in a great, though less 
degree be said of our property, yet our federal government 
has imperfections, which time and more experience will, I 
hope, effectually remedy. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, my lord, with great respect and 
esteem, your lordship's 
</p><p>

My Lord, 
</p><p>
Mr. Ansley this morning delivered the letter you did me 
the honour to write on the 26th of February last. Every 
opportunity of manifesting my attention to your lordship's 
recommendations will give me pleasure, and that induce'ment will conspire, with others of a public nature, to ensure 
to Mr. Ansley my friendly endeavours to facilitate the execution of his commission, and render his residence here 
agreeable to him. 
</p><p>
I perfectly agree in sentiment with your lordship, that it 
much concerns the honour and future intercourse of both 
countries to have the treaty of peace duly and faithfully 
executed. It 'is to be lamented that wars like the last 
usually leave behind them a degree of heat which requires 
some time and prudence to allay. Minds like yours will 
not be susceptible of it, but the mass of the people commonly 
act and reason as they feel, and have seldom sufficient temper and liberality to perceive that peace should draw a veil 
over the injuries of war, and that when hostilities cease, no 
other contest should remain, but that of who shall take the 
lead in magnanimity and manly policy. Although these 
remarks apply to both countries, yet, whatever may be said 
or written to the contrary, there is certainly, my lord, 
more temper in this country than it has credit for ; and J 
am persuaded it would become more manifest, if less 
discouraged by irritating proceedings here and abroad. In 
the Legislature of this State there are this day members 
sitting, who, it is well known, are disqualified by law for 
their conduct during the late contest ; and an act has lately 
passed for restoring all such of the gentlemen of the law 
as, for the same reason, had been suspended from the exercise of their profession. The execution of all laws of this 
sort becomes more and more relaxed, and of the many persons returned to this State from exile, and living in their 
former neighbourhoods, I have not heard of one that has 
met with any molestation. There are, indeed, certain characters who can never return with safety ; but the greater 
part of them are such as merit no other attention from 
any country than what national policy may exact. With 
respect to the generality of these people, the public mind 
daily becomes more and more composed. It is true that 
our affairs are not yet perfectly arranged; some former 
acts are to be done away, and more proper regulations to 
be introduced. There is reason, however, to hope that 
things will gradually come right, and I am persuaded that 
a little more good-nature on the part of Britain, would produce solid and mutual advantages to both countries. 
</p><p>
My lord. I write thus freely from a persuasion that your 
ideas of policy are drawn from those large and liberal views 
and principles, which apply to the future as well as the 
present, and which embrace the interests of the nation and 
of mankind, rather than the local and transitory advantages 
of partial systems and individual ambition; for your lordship's plans on the peace were certainly calculated to make 
the revolution produce only an exchange of dependence for 
friendship, and of sound and feathers for substance and permanent benefits. How greatly would it redound to the 
happiness as well as honour of all civilized people, were 
they to consider and t. ach other like fellow-citizens; 
</p><p>
each nation governing itself as it pleases, but each admitting others to a perfect freedom of commerce. The blessings resulting from the climate and local advantages of one 
countrv would then become common to all, and the bounties of nature and conveniences of art pass from nation to 
nation, without being impeded by the selfish monopolies and 
restrictions, with which narrow policy opposes the extension 
of Divine benevolence. It is pleasant, my lord, to dream 
of these things, and I often enjoy that pleasure ; but though, 
like some of our other dreams, we may wish to see them 
realized, yet the passions and prejudices of mankind forbid 
us to expect it. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, with great respect and sincere 
regard, my lord, 
</p><p>
Your lordship's most obedient

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
During your absence from France, I omitted being so 
regular in my correspondence as I should otherwise have 
been. I have been honoured with your letters of the 18th 
April, and 6th September in the last year, and with one of 
11th February last. They were all communicated to Congress. 
</p><p>
The account of your German excursion is concise and 
interesting. The sentiments and opinions respecting the 
United States and American affairs, which you found there 
prevailing, appear to me very natural. Successful revolutions and victorious arms have always a degree of splendour 
about them, which shines at a great distance, and excites 
admiration, whether well or ill founded. Few have been 
at the pains of examining and understanding the merits of 
the case between Great Britain and us, and nine-tenths of 
that few have taken their sides less from conviction and 
opinion of right, than from some of the many other more 
common and more stimulating motives, which usually govern the declarations and conduct of the mass of mankind. 
It is equally natural that reports to our disadvantage, composed of such proportions of truth and falsehood as might 
render them probable and palatable, should be generally 
diffused and believed. There are very few States, and 
very few ministers in them, who think it convenient to 
magnify America either by word or deed. Politicians, like 
critics, are often more disposed to censure than to commend the works of others, and patriotic manoeuvres pro 
bono publico, like pious frauds pro salute animarum, were 
never uncommon. As there is, and always was, and will 
be, an actual though involuntary coalition between the men 
of too much art, and the men of too little; so they who 
either officially or from choice fabricate opinions for other 
people's use, will always find many to receive and be influenced by them. Thus, errors proceeding from the invention of designing men, are very frequently adopted and 
cherished by others who mistake them for truths. It must 
be easy for the maritime nations to make the rest of Europe 
believe almost what they please of this country for some 
years yet to come, and I shall be much mistaken if fame 
should soon do us justice, especially as her trumpet is, in 
many places, employed and hired for other purposes. 
</p><p>
Whence it happens, I know not, but so the fact is, that I 
have scarcely met with six foreigners in the course of my 
life, who really understood American affairs. The cause 
of truth will probably be little indebted to their memoirs 
and representations ; and when I consider what mistakes arc committed by writers on American subjects, I 
suspect the histories of other countries contain but very 
imperfect accounts of them. 
</p><p>
I can easily conceive that, at the German courts you 
visited, you have done us service ; because I know how 
able, as well as how willing, you are to do it. I wish all 
who speak and write of us were equally well-informed and 
well-disposed. It is a common remark in this country, 
that wherever you go, you do us good. For my part, I 
give you credit, not merely for doing us good, but also for 
doing it uniformly, constantly, and upon system. 
</p><p>
Do you recollect your letter of the 2d March, <a href='/results.php?year=1783'>1783</a>, containing what passed between you and Count de Florida 
Blanca, respecting our western limits? I communicated 
that part of it some months ago to Mr. Gardoqui, in opposition to his pretensions and claims. He lately told me 
you had mistaken the count, for that he never meant to convey to you any thing like a dereliction of those claims : 
which, by-the-bye, are too extensive to be admitted. In a 
word, they do not mean to be restricted to the limits established between Britain and us. Why should people, who 
have so much more territory than they know what to do 
with, he so solicitous to acquire more? 
</p><p>
The moneys due by the United States to subjects of 
France have given occasion to applications by Mr. Marbois, and to reports on them by the board of treasury, 
which are now under the consideration of Congress. You, 
my dear sir, are not unacquainted with the state of our 
finances, nor with the difficulties resulting from the inefficiency of our federal government. Time and more experience must and will cure these evils; when or how is less 
certain, and can only be conjectured. 
</p><p>
I had the honour, last summer, of writing a letter to the 
marchioness, in answer to one she was so obliging as to 
favour me with ; did it ever come to hand? Mrs. Jay 
writes to her by this conveyance. We and many others 
are pleased with the expectation of seeing you both here, 
and with the opportunity we shall then have of personally 
assuring you of our esteem and attachment.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since my last to you of the 16th ultimo, I have been 
honoured with your letter of 23d, and a joint one from you 
and <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Adams</a>, of 25th April. 
</p><p>
Considering the importance of our commerce with Portugal, it gives me pleasure to learn that a treaty with that 
kingdom was so nearly concluded. Until our affairs shall 
be more perfectly arranged, we shall treat under disadvantages ; and therefore I am not surprised that our negotiations with Britain and Barbary are unpromising. To be 
respectable abroad, it is necessary to be so at home ; and that will not be the case until our public faith acquires more confidence, and our govermnent more strength. 
</p><p>
When or how these great objects will be attained, can scarcely be conjectured. An uneasiness prevails through 
the country, and may produce eventually the desired reformations, and it may also produce untoward events. Time 
alone can decide this and many other doubts; for nations, like individuals, are more frequently guided by circumstances, than circumstances by them. 
</p><p>
There are some little circumstances that look as if the 
Dutch regret our having found the way to China ; and that 
will doubtless be more or less the case with every nation 
with whose commercial views we may interfere. I am 
happy in reflecting, that there can be but little clashing of 
interests between us and France, and therefore that she 
will probably continue disposed to wish us well and do us 
good ; especially, if we honestly fulfil our pecuniary engagements with her. These engagements, however, give me 
much concern. Every principle and consideration of 
honour, justice, and interest calls upon us for good faith and 
punctuality; and yet we are unhappily so circumstanced, 
that the moneys necessary for the purpose are not provided, 
nor in such a way of being provided as they ought to be. 
This is owing, not to any thing wrong in Congress, but to 
their not possessing that power of coercion without which 
no government can possibly attain the most salutary and 
constitutional objects. Excuses and palliations, and applications for more time, make bad remittances, and will 
aflbrd no inducements to our allies or others to afford us 
similar aids on future occasions. 
</p><p>
With great respect, I have the honour to be,

Your most obedient and humble servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The inefficacy of our government becomes daily more 
and more apparent. Our treasury and our credit are in a 
sad situation : and it is probable that either the wisdom or 
the passions of the people will produce changes. A spirit 
of licentiousness has infected Massachusetts, which appears 
more formidable than some at first apprehended. Whether 
similar symptoms will not soon mark a like disease in several other States is very problematical. 
</p><p>
The public papers herewith sent contain every thing 
generally known about these matters. A reluctance to 
taxes, an impatience of government, a rage for property 
and little regard to the means of acquiring it, together with 
a desire of equality in all things, seem to actuate the mass 
of those who are uneasy in their circumstances. To these 
may be added the influence of ambitious adventurers, and 
the speculations of the many characters who prefer private 
to public good, and of others who expect to gain more from 
wrecks made by tempests than from the produce of patient and honest industry. As the knaves and fools of this 
world are for ever in alliance, it is easy to perceive how 
much vigour and wisdom a government, from its construction and administration, should possess, in order to repress 
the evils which naturally flow from such copious sources of 
injustice and evil. 
</p><p>
Much, I think, is to be feared from the sentiments which 
such a state of things is calculated to infuse into the minds 
of the rational and well-intentioned. In their eyes, the 
charms of liberty will daily fade ; and in seeking for peace 
and security, they will too naturally turn towards systems 
in direct opposition to those which oppress and disquiet 
them. 
</p><p>
If faction should long bear down law and government, tyranny may raise its head, or the more sober part of the 
people may even think of a king. 
</p><p>
In short, my dear sir, we are in a very unpleasant situation. Changes are necessary; but what they ought to be, 
what they will be, and how and when to be produced, are 
arduous questions. I feel for the cause of liberty, and for 
the honour of my countrymen who have so nobly asserted 
it. and who, at present, so abuse its blessings. If it should 
not take root in this soil, little pains will be taken to cultivate it in any other. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, with great respect, 
Dear sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My report on the answer of the British minister to your 
memorial respecting our frontier posts, is under the consideration of Congress. Your ideas and mine on those subjects very nearly correspond, and I sincerely wish that you 
may be enabled to accommodate every difference between 
us and Britain, on the most liberal principles of justice and 
candour. The result of my inquiries into the conduct of 
the States relative to the treaty, is, that there has not been 
a single day since it took effect, on which it has not been 
violated in America, by one or other of the States ; and this 
observation is just, whether the treaty be supposed to have 
taken effect either at the date or exchange of the provisional 
articles, or on the day of the date of the definitive treaty, or 
of the ratifications of it. 
</p><p>
Our affairs are in a very unpleasant situation, and 
changes become necessary, and in some little degree probable. When government, either from defects in its construction or administration, ceases to assert its rights, or is 
too feeble to afford security, inspire confidence, and overawe the ambitious and licentious, the best citizens naturally 
grow uneasy and look to other systems. 
</p><p>
How far the disorders of Massachusetts may extend, or 
how they will terminate, is problematical ; nor is it possible 
to decide whether the people of Rhode Island will remain 
much longer obedient to the very extraordinary and exceptionable laws passed, for compelling them to embrace the 
doctrine of the political transubstantiation of paper into 
gold and silver. 
</p><p>
I suspect that our posterity will read the history of our 
last four years with much regret. 
</p><p>
I enclose for your information a pamphlet, containing the 
acts of the different States granting an impost to Congress. 
</p><p>
You will also find enclosed a copy of an act of Congress, 
of 20th and 21st ult., for raising an additional number of 
troops. This measure was doubtless necessary, although 
the difficulty of providing for the expense of it is a serious 
one. I flatter myself you will be able to obviate any improper suspicions which the minister may be led to entertain respecting the object of this force. I have pressed the 
policy of deciding on my report on the infractions of the 
treaty without delay, that you may thence be furnished 
with conclusive arguments against the insinuations of those 
who may wish to infuse and support opinions unfavourable 
to us on these points. 
</p><p>
The newspapers herewith sent will give you information 
in detail of Indian affairs, but they will not tell you what, 
however is the fact, that our people have committed several 
unprovoked acts of violence against them. These acts 
ouo-ht to have excited the notice of government, and been 
punished in an exemplary manner. 
</p><p>
With great and sincere esteem and regard, I have the 
honour to be, dear sir,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your friendly letter has long remained unanswered ; but 
a variety of private, as well as public affairs, constrained 
me to postpone indulging myself in the pleasure I always 
derive from writing to my friends. The recess (if I may 
so call it) of Congress gives their officers too much leisure 
at present ; and there is reason to fear, that the members 
will be as long in convening this year as they were last. 
Business is at a stand for want of an adequate representation. The languor of the States is to be lamented ; many 
inconveniences have already arisen from it, and if continued, 
serious evils will awaken our people. Our affairs, my dear 
sir, are in a delicate situation, and it is much to be wished, 
that the real patriots, throughout the States, would exert 
themselves to render it more sale and respectable. The 
feuds in Massachusetts are rather suspended than extinguished. What events they may ultimately produce, is 
uncertain ; but I should not be surprised if much trouble 
was to result from them. The public creditors will soon 
become importunate, and Congress cannot create the means 
of satisfying them. It is true that order usually succeeds 
confusion ; but it is a high price to pay for order, especially when a little virtue and good sense would procure 
it for us on very reasonable terms. If the best men would 
be prevailed upon to come forward, and take the lead in 
our legislatures as well as in Congress, and would unite 
their endeavours to rescue their country from its present 
condition, our affairs, both at home and abroad, would soon 
wear a more pleasing aspect. It is time for our people to 
distinguish more accurately than they seem to do, between 
liberty and licentiousness. The late revolution would lose 
much of its glory, as well as utility, if our conduct should 
confirm the tory maxim, " That men are incapable of governing themselves."

Permit me to hint whether it would not be wise and seasonable to provide a strong check to the admission of 
foreigners into the administration of our national government ; and to declare expressly that the command in chief 
of the American army shall not be given to, nor devolve on 
any but a natural born citizen.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am not sure that the new government will be found to 
rest on principles sufficiently stable to produce a uniform 
adherence to what justice, dignity, and liberal policy may 
require ; for however proper such conduct may be, none 
but great minds will always deem it expedient. Men in 
general are guided more by conveniences than by principles ; this idea accompanies all my reflections on the new 
constitution, and induced me to remark to our late Convention at <a href='/results.php?city=poughkeepsie' rel='city'>Poughkeepsie</a>, that some of the most unpopular and 
strong parts of it appeared to me to be the most unexceptionable. Government without liberty is a curse ; but 
on the other hand, liberty without government is far from 
being a blessing. 
</p><p>
The opponents in this State to the constitution decrease 
and grow temperate. Many of them seem to look forward 
to another Convention, rather as a measure that will justify 
their opposition, than produce all the effects they pretended 
to expect from it. I wish that measure may be adopted 
with a good grace, and without delay or hesitation. So 
many good reasons can be assigned for postponing the 
session of such a Convention for three or four years, that I 
really believe the great majority of its advocates would be 
satisfied with that delay ; after which I think we should not 
have much danger to apprehend from it, especially if the 
new government should in the mean time recommend itself 
to the people by the wisdom of their proceedings, which I 
flatter myself will be the case. The division of the 
powers of government into three departments, is a great 
and valuable point gained, and will give the people the best 
opportunity of bringing the question whether they can 
govern themselves to a decision in their favour.

It is as vet exceedinglv uncertain who will be senators for this State, and consequently it cannot be even conjectured by what leading motives they will probably be influenced in their appointments. Whoever they may be, I 
shall not omit to apprize them of your services and character. This I take to be the precise extent of your request,

station prescribes a degree of delicacy and reserve relative 
to other departments, which, though sometimes unpleasant, 
is always proper. It gives me pleasure to be persuaded, 
that on this head our sentiments correspond, and that you 
prefer a uniform adherence to propriety, to any friendly 
efforts beyond its limits.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obliging letter of the 5th instant was delivered to 
me last week. 
</p><p>
You know it is important that confidence and cordiality 
subsist between the heads of the departments, that they 
may, when necessary, unite their efforts to promote their 
respective operations for the public good. To this end 
much delicacy and candour should be observed towards 
each other, and all unnecessary interference avoided. It 
is likewise important that harmony and confidence subsist 
between the principal and other officers of each department, that no personal jealousies or discontents may embarrass the business of it. These and all other prudential 
considerations will doubtless have their due degree of 
weight with the president, in all his nominations ; and I 
mention them, merely because they lead me to think it 
would be improper for me to recommend to the president 
any person for a place in any other department than the 
one in which I may hold the first. All that I could do, 
therefore, in the present case was, to inform the president 
that it would give you pleasure to serve the public in the 
place you mention. This I have done, nor could details 
be necessary. You are far from being a stranger to the 
public ; you have enjoyed strong marks of their confidence, and have long been personally known to the 
president.

Dear Sir. 
</p><p>
I have this moment been favoured with your letter of the 
10th of this month. Mr. Sedgwick has given me the same 
character of Mr. Tucker that you do. There are at present several candidates for the place in question,* and probably the number will be increased before the appointment 
takes place. As it should be the result of mutual information and joint consultation between the judges, it appears to 
me proper that I should in the mean time remain free from 
engagements, express or implied, to or for any gentleman, 
however well recommended. The reserve which this consideration imposes will not permit me to enlarge upon this 
subject ; but I know of no consideration which should restrain

which I am, dear sir,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I was favoured with yours of the 28th ultimo as I was 
preparing to go out of town. It was not until last evening 
that I returned, or I should have taken an earlier opportunity of answering your letter. 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks tor your friendly congratulations. I 
believe them sincere, and value them accordingly. It would 
give me great pleasure to see your situation more comfortable. On these occasions it is best to be very explicit ; it 
would neither be friendly nor candid to excite delusory 
expectations, or to make promises without a good prospect 
of performing them. There is not a single office in my 
gift ; nor do I recollect that there is more than one in the 
appointment of the court, I mean their clerk. As to offices 
in the gift of other departments, I think it my duty not to 
interfere, nor to ask favours, it being improper for a judge 
to put himself under such obligations. 
</p><p>
I am sincerely disposed to serve my friends, and you 
among others ; but it can only be in a way perfectly consistent with the duties and proprieties of my public station. 
These considerations will, I am persuaded, have their due 
weight with you, and rather increase than diminish the 
esteem and attachment you have always expressed and 
manifested for me. I regret that on this occasion I cannot say things more consonant with your wishes ; but 
sincerity, though not always pleasing, is preferable to mere 
civility. 
</p><p>
Be assured of my constant regard, and that I remain

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On returning from Exeter the evening before the last, I 
had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 13th inst. 
with the two copies mentioned in it. Having no apprehension of such measures, what was to be done appeared 
to me a question of some difficulty as well as importance. 
To treat them as very important might render them more 
so than I think they are. The author of McFingal could 
do justice to the subject. The assumption will do its own 
work. It will justify itself, and not want advocates. Every 
indecent interference of State assemblies will diminish 
their influence. The national government has only to do 
what is right, and if possible, be silent. If compelled to 
speak, it should be in few words, strongly evincive of ternper, dignity, and self-respect. Conversation and desultory 
paragraphs will do the rest. 
</p><p>
The national government gains ground in these countries, 
and I hope care will be taken to cherish the national spirit 
which is prevailing in them. The deviation from contract 
touching interest does not please very universally. An 
individual remarked, that while Congress thought themselves authorized to take such liberties, private property 
could not be secure in a national bank. 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
John J a v.

</p><p>
Dear .Sir. 
</p><p>
My first idea was to have made a sketch of what, in my opinion, would be proper on the occasion ; but finding in the progress of it that my information relative to the actual 
state of affairs was not sufficiently particular, and in several respects defective, it became necessary to confine my several remarks. 
</p><p>
How far the present fiscal arrangements require amendments or additions, can best be ascertained of the secretary. I recollect one case which should be provided for, 
viz. where bribes are offered to revenue officers. It will 
rarely happen that the offer of a bribe can be proved, except by the man to whom it is offered, and if he be disqualified (by being interested in the penalty) from giving 
testimony, the offender must be acquitted. Auxiliary provisions may, in the execution of other parts of these 
statutes, have been found wanting ; this merits inquiry. If 
amendments are contemplated, it may be proper to observe, that as all new T institutions are liable to defects which 
experience only can discover, it may be useful to consider 
whether the revenue laws require any amendments to render them more competent to their objects. 
</p><p>
Whether it is intended to bring forward any and what 
plans for additional supplies, I know not; if it is, some general ideas leading the attention that way might be expedient. If not, perhaps it would be well to observe, that the 
existing revenues being equal to the ordinary exigences of 
the nation, it will not be necessary to increase them for 
any other purpose than that of reducing the public debt. 
This idea, I think, should be constantly held up. 
</p><p>
If there should this year be a surplus of revenue, the 
whole or part of which could be spared for domestic objects, might it not be best to apply it towards discharging 
the French debt, and to introduce the recommendation by 
some observations like these, viz. that the friendly disposition and aids of the king and people of France had been 
highly conducive to the establishment of our liberty and 
independence : and therefore that they might, with great 
propriety, expect from the United States every mark of 
attention which their and our circumstances might render 
eligible. That the cause of liberty and good government 
was the cause of all mankind ; and that the exertions of the 
citizens of France to introduce and establish those blessings, 
not only merited general approbation, but were particularly 
entitled to our best wishes for their success. That the 
United States could not better evince this friendly disposition than by applying part of their revenues towards paying the debt due to France, at a season when, from the 
derangements incident to revolutions, it could not fail of 
being both acceptable and useful. 
</p><p>
Indian affairs afford another topic, but on this subject my 
information is too limited to enable me to see things as 
they probably are. But be they as they may, it might 
answer a good purpose occasionally to hint at the justice 
and policy of treating those nations with benevolence, and 
with constant regard to good faith. 
</p><p>
If circumstances of importance should make it proper to 
say any thing of the territories, and the immediate government of the United States, it would afford an opportunity 
of recommending the encouragement of schools, and the 
policy of assisting the settlers in making such highways as 
might open and facilitate communications with the adjacent 
States. 
</p><p>
As to foreign affairs, I am inclined to think that at present 
little, if any thing, should be said about them; unless some 
matters very interesting to the United States should have 
occurred. It is said, that a minister from England may 
soon be expected. He may, or he may not come. The 
disposition of that court towards us cannot yet, I believe, 
be unequivocally ascertained. To be silent, and thereby 
to avoid either courting or irritating them, appears to me 
advisable in the present moment 
</p><p>
The judicial system undoubtedly calls for revision; but 
I rather think it will be better to include it generally among 
those other subjects heretofore recommended, which it may 
be necessary again to mention, than to make any pointed 
remarks respecting it. 
</p><p>
To convey necessary information, and to suggest useful 
hints on the one hand, and on the other so to do both as to 
cause as few questions or divisions as possible in framing 
the addresses in answer, seems to be all that can be requisite. 
</p><p>
All things have their order. All that ought to be done, 
cannot be done at once. Those, therefore, of the greatest 
present importance should take the lead, and the rest be 
reserved for future sessions. 
</p><p>
As to public and private communications, it strikes me 
that the former should contain only important and public 
information, and in generals ; and that details, as well as 
intelligence of a more secret nature, or of lesser importance, should be conveyed by message. 
</p><p>
The census is a subject about which much might, but 
little need be said, the observations pertinent to it being obvious. I think that something should be said, generally 
and cautiously (by way of information), of the proceedings 
in the business of the federal district ; and if necessary, 
the details mav be communicated by message. Of the 
bank, I doubt the expediency of saying any tiling ; especially as its affairs are under the management of its 
directors. 
</p><p>
Thus, my dear sir, I have committed to paper what 
passed in my mind relative to these subjects with that freedom which your friendship invites, and without that caution 
and reserve which a sense of your judgment, experience, 
and discretion tends naturally to create. 
I regret the circumstance which called you to Mount 
Vernon, and hope the recovery of your nephew has relieved you from all anxieties on that account. I can perceive no reasons which ought to restrain you from frequent 
visits to it during the recess of Congress. It would conduce to your health, and so far to the public good. Besides, the distance is not so great, but that in the ordinary 
course of things, your presence at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> might, at 
convenient intervals, be spared ; for should any thing extraordinary occur, you might very soon be advised of it, 
and if necessary, return. Be pleased to present my respectful compliments to your lady ; and believe me to be, with 
perfect respect, esteem, and attachment,

My dear Brother, 
</p><p>
A person who says he left New-York last Friday, reports 
that a putrid disorder prevailed there, and that among many 
others, it had rendered your house a house of mourning. 
This unexpected event affects me greatly. I can easily 
conceive what your feelings on the occasion must be, and 
sympathize with you very sincerely. I much regret my 
absence from you, for although friendly attentions cannot 
heal the wounds of affliction, they in some degree assuage 
their anguish. I know, and that by experience, that more 
consolation is to be derived from a firm confidence in the 
wisdom of Him who governs the world, and from resignation to His will who never errs, than from all other circumstances and considerations united. Our departed friends 
are but gone home before us. We must all follow, and, if 
prepared to follow, shall after a little while rejoin them, 
where death or pain can never intrude. 
It is true, that in the mean time we neither can nor ought 
to obliterate the impressions which such events naturally 
make on the human heart and mind. But there certainly 
is a difference between sustaining the burden of affliction 
as Christians, and sinking under it as men without fortitude 
or hope. 
</p><p>
May God grant you those consolations which the world 
cannot give nor take away. 
</p><p>
Believe me to be, 
</p><p>
Your very affectionate brother,

</p><p>
My good Friend, 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of seeing Senor Ceracchi, and 
his model of a monument in honour of the revolution. The 
design appears to me to be a noble one, worthy the attention 
of the United States, and honourable to the taste and 
talents of the artist. It cannot fail of being interesting to 
all who contributed to the revolution, and to that glorious 
triumph of liberty which it exhibited, and which well deserves a magnificent monument. The ancient republics, 
to whose very imperfections we are sometimes partial, 
afford precedents. Why should not the Congress adopt 
and carry this design into execution ? The expense ? for 
my part I think the expense proper, and therefore confide 
in the sense and sentiment of the public. If the money 
was now to be provided, the measure would be iinseasonable, on account of the Indian war. That obstacle will be 
of short duration. We need not begin the monument this 
year. To adopt the plan will cost nothing. The work 
must necessarily be long on hand, and as the expense will 
be gradually incurred, so also it will be gradually defrayed. 
The sum annually requisite can be but small compared 
with the object, and with our resQurces. Although it would 
better become the nation, than individuals, to undertake it, 
yet provided the nation assume the task, the aid of subscriptions, and even State donations, might, if necessary, be 
recurred to. If you would say, it shall be begun as soon 
as a certain sum is subscribed, there is reason to believe it 
would be subscribed. If the ways and means be referred 
to <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Hamilton</a>, he will indicate the most eligible. 
His official station, information, and talents, would render it 
proper. 
</p><p>
The gentleman who formed the design, will be the most 
proper person to execute it. Another artist would not feel 
the same degree of interest in it, nor is it certain that 
another of equal talents could easily be had. 
</p><p>
As to his reward, — it is a matter which I think should 
not (// present be contemplated. Let the work be finished, 
and then make him such an acknowledgment as would 
become the nation on the one hand, and him on the other. 
I can conceive of no other rule on such occasions, and in 
relation to such objects. 
</p><p>
I confess to you that the effect which this measure would 
naturally have on the president's feelings, is with me an 
additional inducement. We shall not be reproached for 
letting him die by an executioner, or in chains, or in exile, 
or in neglect and disgrace, as many Greek and Roman 
patriots died. On the contrary, we shall be commended 
throughout all generations for the part we have hitherto 
acted respecting him. It is only while he lives that we can 
have the satisfaction of offering the fruits of gratitude and 
affection to his enjoyment. Posterity can have only the 
pensive pleasure of strewing flowers on his grave. 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have conferred with <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='colleague met'>Mr. King</a> on the subject of your 
letter of the 3d inst. We concur in opinion that neither a 
proclamation, nor a particular charge by the court to the 
grand jury would be advisable at present. To us it appears more prudent, that this business be opened by the 
president's speech, at the ensuing session of Congress. 
Their address will manifest the sense of the House, and both 
together operate more effectually than a proclamation. 
</p><p>
No strong declarations should be made, unless there be 
ability and disposition to follow them with strong measures. 
Admitting both these requisites, it is questionable whether 
such operations at this moment would not furnish the Anties 
with materials for deceiving the uninformed part of the 
community, and in some measure render the operations of 
government odious. Let all the branches of government 
move together, and let the chiefs be committed publicly on 
one or the other side of the question. I perceive symptoms 
of the crisis you mention ; if managed with discretion and 
firmness, it will weaken its authors. If matters can pass 
on, sub silentio, until the meeting of Congress, I think all 
will be well. The public will become informed, and the 
sense of the nation become manifest. Opposition to that 
sense will be clogged with apprehensions, and strong measures, if necessary, will be approved, and be supported. 
if, in the mean time, such outrages should be committed 
as to force the attention of government to its dignity, 
nothing will remain but to obey that necessity in a way that 
will leave nothing to hazard. Success, on such occasions, 
should be certain. Whether this should be done under the 
president's personal direction, must, I think, depend on 
circumstances at the time; or in other words, on the degree of importance which those circumstances combined 
may evince.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On my return this evening from Rye, I found your letter 
of the 18th instant at my house. It is not difficult to perceive that your situation is unpleasant, and it is easy to 
predict that your enemies will endeavour to render it still 
more so. The thorns they strew in your way will (if you 
please) hereafter blossom, and furnish garlands to decorate 
your administration. Resolve nol to be driven from your 
station, and as your situation must, it seems, be militant, act 
accordingly. Envy will tell posterity that your difficulties, 
from the state of things, wore inconsiderable, compared 
with the great, growing, and untouched resources of the 
nation. Your difficulties from persons and party will, by 
time, be carried out of sight, unless you prevent it. ?Co 
other person will possess sufficient facts and details to do 
full justice to the subject, and I think your reputation points 
to the expediency of memoirs. You want time, it is true, 
but few of us know how much time we can find when we 
set about it. 
</p><p>
Had not your letter come from the post-office, I should 
suspect it had been opened. The wafer looked very much 
like it. Such letters should be sealed with wax, impressed 
with your seal. 
</p><p>
I rejoice with you in the re-election of <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Adams</a>. It 
has relieved my mind from much inquietude. It is a great 
point gained ; but the unceasing industry and arts of the 
Anties render perseverance, union, and constant efforts 
necessary. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear sir. 
</p><p>
Yours, sincerely,

Sir. 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the ingenious work which you was so obliging as to send me by Mr. Childs. I have read it 
with pleasure and improvement: it casts new light on several interesting questions, and I observe in it a degree 
of perspicuity not always to be found in dissertations on such subjects. 
</p><p>
The connexion between mind and body, and the operations of the former on and through the latter, continue 
involved in great obscurity. Persevering attention and 
inquiry will, probably, produce further information. The 
spiritual and material worlds, if I may use the expression, 
appear to me to be so widely different and opposite, that I 
am often inclined to suspect the existence of others, intermediate, but of a nature distinct from cither. 
</p><p>
It is much to be wished that nothing may occur to prevent your finishing the analysis of the intellectual powers, 
and extending your speculations to man considered as an 
active and moral being, and as he m mber of a political 
society. There is reason to doubt whether this field of 
science has, as yet, received the highest cultivation of which 
it is capable. The republic of letters is under many 
obligations to your country. May those obligations be 
increased. 
I have the honour to be, with sentiments of respect and 
esteem, sir,

Dear Sir,

I was this day honoured with your letter of yesterday. 
I expect to sail in the course of a fortnight, and, if my 
prayers and endeavours avail, my absence will not be of 
long duration. 
</p><p>
From the confidence you repose in me, I derive the most 
pleasing emotions, and I thank you for them. Life is uncertain — whether I take your letter with me, or leave it here, 
it would, in case of my death, be inspected by others, who, 
however virtuous, might be indiscreet. After much reflection, I conclude it will be most prudent to commit it to you, 
without retaining any copy or memorandum, except in my 
memory, where the numerous proofs of your kind attention 
to me are carefully preserved.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My letter of this date to Mr. Randolph contains an exact 
account of the present state of the affairs of my mission 
here. I shall be disappointed if no good should result. 
As yet, the minister stands entirely uncommitted. From 
some light circumstances, I incline to believe that our mercantile injuries will be redressed ; but how or how far, I 
cannot conjecture. My next conference will doubtless 
place things in more particular and in clearer points of 
view. 
</p><p>
Dr. Gordon has information, winch he relies upon, that 
the posts will not be surrendered, and he authorizes me to 
tell you so in confidence. His information dors not make so 
strong an impression upon my mind as it docs on his; it 
merits attention, but, in my opinion, is not conclusive. 
</p><p>
The observations I have hitherto made induce me to believe that the war with France is popular, and that a war 
with us would be unpopular. The word Jacobin is here a 
term of reproach, and used as such among the common 
people. They who wish the reform of this government, 
do, I apprehend, wish a certain degree of success to the 
present French cause, not because they like it, but because 
they think such success would promote their favourite objects. I often hear gentlemen converse on these subjects, 
but I think it prudent to be reserved ; as to their internal 
parties and divisions, I make it a rule to remain silent. 
</p><p>
Your administration is greatly commended. The idea 
entertained by some, of applying private debts to compensate public injuries, alarms and disgusts, and impairs credit. 
I am anxious to have it in my power to communicate something decisive. As yet, I am entirely satisfied with the 
minister. 
</p><p>
I ought to add, that Mr. Pinckney's conduct relative to 
me corresponds with my ideas of delicacy and propriety. 
</p><p>
With perfect respect, esteem, and attachment, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your obliged and obedient servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
P. S. The enclosed copies of a note of the l!>th inst. 
from <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a>, and my answer, afford indications of 
his present temper, that will not escape you. It is always 
useful to communicate such papers, but seldom useful to 
publish them. Publications, unnecessarily and frequently 
made, must naturally increase reserve and circumspection 
to such a degree as, in a great measure, to exclude the advantages of confidence and conversation, and to confine 
negotiation to the slow and, wary mode of written communications, written too under the impression and expectation 
of publication,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Among my letters to Mr. Randolph, is one stating an 
agreement between <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a> and myself for preserving things in a pacific and unaltered state, between us and 
the British on the side of Canada and the frontiers ; and 
Mr. Simcoe will soon receive orders to retire from Miami 
to his former positions. 
</p><p>
Some cabinet councils have lately been held, and it is 
probable the manner of settling their differences with us 
has been among the subjects of their deliberations. From 
the silence and circumspection of <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a>, I apprehend that the cabinet has not as yet ultimately concluded 
on their plan. This delay is unpleasant, but I do not think 
it unnatural. The opposition members lately come in have 
so often held a language friendly to America, that it is probable they will find it necessary, in order to be consistent, to 
adhere to sentiments not agreeable to some of the others. 
</p><p>
I am led by several little circumstances, not easily detailed or explained, to believe that the late administration 
looked upon a war with us as inevitable ; and I am of opinion that the instructions of the 6th November were influenced by that idea. I do also believe that Lord Dorchester 
was instructed to act conformably to that idea, and that 
Simcoe was governed by it. 
</p><p>
I am certain that intelligence (which made some impression) was conveyed to the ministry, that our army, if successful against the Indians, had orders to attack and take 
the posts. There is also room to believe, that the indiscreet 
reception given to the late French minister — the unnecessary rejoicings about French successes, and a variety of 
similar circumstances, did impress the government with 
strong apprehensions of an unavoidable war with us, and 
did induce them to entertain a disposition hostile to us. 
</p><p>
I have given <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a> positive assurances, that no 
attack [tending the negotiations will be made on the posts 
held by them at the conclusion of the war ; but I also told 
him that I thought it highly probable that every new advanced post, and particularly the one said to be taken by 
Mr. Simcoc on the Miami, would be attacked. I must do 
him the justice to say, that hitherto I have found him fair 
and candid, and apparently free from asperity or irritation. 
</p><p>
So far as personal attentions to the envoy may be regarded as symptoms of good-will to his country, my prospect is favourable. These symptoms, however, are never 
decisive : they justify expectation, but not reliance. 
</p><p>
I most heartily wish the business over, and myself at 
home again. But it would not be prudent to urge and 
press unceasingly, lest ill-humour should result, and illhumour will mar any negotiation ; on the other hand, much 
forbearance and seeming inactivity invite procrastination 
and neglect. The line between these extremes is delicate : 
I will endeavour to find and observe it.

Sir,

Accept my thanks for the friendly congratulations and 
sentiments expressed in your letter of the 14th of this 
month. 
</p><p>
I regret my not knowing that you resided at Bath. We 
passed from Falmouth through that city in our way to this. 
It would have given me pleasure to have called upon you, 
and (to use an Indian expression) have brightened the chain. 
</p><p>
Many great and unexpected events have taken place 
since we parted. We live in times that teem with them. 
A great and wonderful drama is exhibiting on the stage of 
Europe, perhaps of the world. We are spectators of the 
first act. What may succeed, or what the catastrophe will 
be, human prevision cannot discern. 
</p><p>
Peace and domestic comforts rise in value as they become precarious; and individual misery, by abounding, 
produces national distress ; and yet, even in this age of 
reason and philosophy, the passions do not cease to fan the 
flames of war, and cause them to rage, to spread, and to 
desolate. 
</p><p>
If, during my stay here, you should visit London, I shall 
be happy to see you, and to assure you of the esteem and 
regard with which I am

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am this moment returned from a long conference with 
<a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a>. Our prospects become more and more 
promising as we advance in the business. The compensation cases are described in the answer, and the amount of 
damages will, I have reason to hope, be referred to the decision of commissioners mutually to be appointed by the two 
governments, and the money paid without delay on their 
certificates, and the business finished as speedily as may be 
possible. The question of admitting our vessels into the 
islands, under certain limitations, is under consideration, and 
will soon be decided. A treaty of commerce is on the 
carpet. All other things being agreed, the posts will be included. They contend that the article about the negroes 
does not extend to those who came in on their proclamation, to whom (being vested with the property in them by 
the rights of war) they gave freedom ; but only to those who 
were, bona fide, the property of Americans when the war 
ceased. They will, I think, insist that British debts, so far 
as injured by lawful impediments, should be repaired by 
the United States, by decision of mutual commissioners. 
These things have passed in conversation, but no commitments on either side — and not to be of any official weight 
or use whatever. 
</p><p>
The king observed to me the other day, " Well, sir, I 
imagine you begin to see that your mission will probably be successful." — " I am happy, may it please your majesty, to find that you entertain that idea." — " Well, but 
don't you perceive that it is like to be so ?" — " There are 
some recent circumstances (the answer to my representation, &c.) which induce me to flatter myself that it will be 
so." He nodded with a smile, signifying that it was to 
those circumstances that he alluded. The conversation 
then turned to indifferent topics : this was at the drawingroom. 
</p><p>
I have never been more unceasingly employed than I 
have been for some time past, and still am. I hope for good, 
but God only knows. The Wm. Penn sails in the morning. 
I write these few lines in haste, to let you see that the business is going on as fast as can reasonably be expected ; and 
that it is very important that peace and quiet should be 
preserved for the present. On hearing, last night, that one 
of our Indiamen had been carried into <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>, I mentioned 
it to <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a>. He will write immediately by the 
packet on the subject. Indeed, I believe that they are endeavouring to restore a proper conduct towards us everyv/irre, but it will take some time before the effect can be 
visible. I write all this to you in confidence, and for your 
private satisfaction. I have not time to explain my reasons, 
but they are cogent. "I could fill some sheets with interesting communications, if I had leisure ; but other matters 
press, and must not be postponed, for " there is a tide in 
human affairs," of which every moment is precious. Whatever may be the issue, nothing in my power to ensure success shall be neglected or delayed.

My good Friend, 
</p><p>
I passed this morning in a visit to Sir John Sinclair, 
President of the Board of Agriculture, and to Col. Bentham, 
who is preparing for the establishment of a panopticon, 
agreeable to the plan delineated in a publication winch I 
once communicated to you. 
</p><p>
The Agricultural Society is incorporated, with a yearly 
allowance, by government, of three thousand pounds. Their 
plans are extensive ; they have been singularly industrious, and much has been done. I enclose you the proposed plan of their general report ; if executed in the extent 
and in the manner intended, it will be the most interesting 
work of the kind, respecting husbandry, which has appeared 
in any country. 
</p><p>
Sir John showed us sheep of different breeds, stuffed and 
prepared in the highest degree of perfection. Of these, 
drawings are making ; models are collecting of the most 
useful machines, among them is one for cleaning grain from 
the straw, which, by the help of two horses and a man and 
a boy, will do 70 or 80 bushels per day. They begin to be 
in use among the farmers, which I consider as a proof of 
their answering the purpose. 
</p><p>
Among the sheep, the Teesewater is the largest. Sir 
John showed me a fleece presented to the Board, which 
weighed twenty odd pounds. He tells me they frequently 
weigh sixty pounds a quarter. 
</p><p>
From Saxony, he is informed that the Spanish breed had 
been imported there : that they succeeded well, and did not 
merate. They sent him a sample of the wool. I enclose a lock of it. This fact shows that the fineness of wool 
depends not less on breed than on management. 
</p><p>
Sir John has a farm in Scotland which rented for £300 
a-year. It was employed in raising store-cattle, which 
wore usually sold into England, and fattened for the London market. He dismissed the cattle, and introduced 
sheep; it proved profitable, and he is now offered £<a href='/results.php?year=1200'>1200</a> 
a-year for it : his flock is <a href='/results.php?year=3000'>3000</a>. 
</p><p>
The progress of husbandry in this country is astonishing; 
the king patronizes it, and is himself a great farmer. He 
has been doing much in that way at Windsor. 
</p><p>
Colonel Bentham has invented a number of curious and 
very useful machines, intended to be introduced into the 
panopticon. He showed us a model of the building ; it 
seems admirably calculated for its purposes. 
</p><p>
He has a machine for sawing at once from a plank the 
felloe of a wheel to its form — another contrivance for cutting 
it to its proper length and angle — another for finishing the 
spoke — another for boring and morticing the hub — another 
for driving the spokes. He has one for turning a circular 
saw for small work — another for making the mouldings, if 
they may be so called, on the pieces which form sashes — 
one for sawing stone — others for working different kinds of 
saws into many slabs at once — another for polishing them 
— another for planing boards, and taking a shaving of its 
full width from one end to the other, &c. &c. &c. He has 
patents for these machines, but as yet they cannot be purchased : he has one for cutting corks with incredible expedition. 
. Governor Hunter, from Norfolk Island, with whom I 
was last week in company, speaking of its productions, 
mentioned that among the birds there were swans that 
were black, having only a few white feathers in the wings. 
They are plenty. One stuffed and well preserved, I am 
told, is here : as yet I have not seen it. He also mentioned 
a wild flax growing on upland to about three feet high, 
and good. I do not yet learn that any of the seed of it is 
here. 
</p><p>
They who have leisure and a turn for these things might 
here acquire much entertaining and some useful information. Want of time represses my curiosity, and will not 
allow me to pay much attention to objects unconnected with 
those of my mission. 
</p><p>

Your affectionate friend and servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
We have both heard it asserted that a man's character 
may be discerned from his handwriting ; if that be true, 
you and our friend, <a href='/results.php?tla=ewr' rel='colleague met friend'>Edward Rutledge</a>, must be as enigmatical and unintelligible as Oliver Cromwell, and yet 
neither of you resemble him more than he did an honest man. 
</p><p>
The kindness diffused through your letter of the 19th of 
June paid me for the trouble of deciphering it. Two or 
three words, however, proved too hard for me. To judge 
from the context, I presume they mean something good 
and friendly, and therefore that I have reason to be pleased 
with the ideas intended to be conveyed by them, although 
I do not know precisely what they are. 
</p><p>
Peace, my dear sir, was formerly thought a good sort of 
thing ; but within these few years past it seems to have been 
going fast out of fashion. But, to be serious, there seems 
to be something more than common at work in, or on the 
human mind, and urging it to enterprise, tending to introduce a new state of things. Symptoms of it appear more 
or less, and in differenl degrees, in all parts of Europe — 
even in Spain, where quiescency in every sense has long 
been cherished. Geneva is at this moment undergoing 
another revolution; where next, no one can tell. Our 
country may catch the flame. We live in an eventful 
season. We have nothing to do but our duty, and one 
part of it is to prepare for every event. Let us preserve 
peace while it can be done with propriety; and if in that we 
fail, let us wage war, not in newspapers and impotent sarcasms, but with manly firmness, and unanimous and vigorous efforts. 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of seeing your brother frequently, 
and am pleased with him. He is gone to Scotland. He 
has communicated to me a circumstance that I rejoice in. 
</p><p>
Assure Mrs. Read of my best wishes. With real esteem 
and regard, I am, dear sir,

My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am still unable to say any thing decisive relative to the 
objects of my mission. Appearances continue to be singularly favourable, but appearances merit only a certain 
degree of circumspect reliance. The delays occasioned by 
the new arrangement of the ministry cannot be of long 
continuance. Circumstances must soon constrain them to 
form some ultimate system relative to the United States ; 
and although I have much reason to hope it will be favourable to our wishes, yet I confess I am not without apprehensions, that certain points not by us to be yielded, will 
occasion difficulties hard to surmount. Personally, I have 
every reason to - be satisfied, and officially, I have as yet no 
reason to complain. 
</p><p>
Shortly after my arrival, I dined with <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a>. 
The cabinet ministers were present, but not a single foreigner. On Monday next I am to dine with the lordchancellor, and on next Friday with Mr. Pitt. I mention 
these facts to explain what I mean by favourable appearances. I think it best that they should remain unmentioned 
for the present, and they make no part of my communications to Mr. Randolph or others. This is not the season 
for such communications ; they may be misinterpreted, 
though not by you. 
</p><p>
I fear the posts may labour, but they must not be left. 
We must not make a delusive settlement ; that would disunite our peop-c, and leave seeds of discord to germinate. 
I will do every thing that prudence and integrity may dictate or permit. 
</p><p>
I will endeavour to accommodate rather than dispute ; 
and if this plan should fail, decent and firm representations 
must conclude the business of my mission. As vet, I do 
not regret any step I have taken. I wish I may be able to 
say the same at the conclusion.

Dear Sin, 
</p><p>
I had last week the pleasure of receiving from you a few 
lines by Mr. Blaney. You will receive this letter by the 
hands of <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Morris</a>. He will also be the bearer of my 
despatches to Mr. Randolph. They will be voluminous, 
particular, and. in many respects, interesting. It should not 
be forgotten that there is irritation here as well as in 
America, and that our party processions, toasts, rejoicings, 
&c. &c, have not been well calculated to produce goodwill and good-humour. The government, nevertheless, 
distinguish between national acts and party effusions, and 
have entertained hitherto an opinion and belief that the 
president and our government and nation in general, were 
really desirous of an amicable settlement of differences, 
and of laying a foundation for friendship as well as peace 
between the two countries. 
</p><p>
The secretary's letters by <a href='/results.php?tla=jam' rel='colleague'>Mr. Monroe</a>, and his speech 
on his introduction to the Convention, have appeared in the 
English papers. Their impression in this country may 
easily be conjectured. I wish they had both been more 
guarded. The language of the United States at Paris and 
London should correspond with their neutrality. These 
things are not favourable to my mission. A speedy conclusion to the negotiation is problematical, though not highly 
improbable. If I should be able to conclude the business 
on admissible terms, I shall do it and risk consequences, 
rather than by the delay of waiting fur and governing myself 
by opinions and instructions, hazard a change in the disposition of this court ; for it seems our country, or rather some 
part- of it, will not forbear asperities. I hear that Virginia 
is taking British property by escheat ; and other things 
which in the present moment are unseasonable, are here 
reported. 
As the proposed articles are under consideration — as they 
have already undergone some alterations, and as I am not 
without hopes of other and further amendments, I really 
think they ought not to be published in their present crude 
state, especially as in the course of a few weeks I expect 
to be able to communicate their ultimate form. If they 
should not appear to me to be such as I ought to sign, I 
will transmit them, and wait for further instructions.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
A gentleman in Holland has been so obliging as to send 
me a plan to make my fortune, even to the extent of many 
millions of pounds sterling. It unfortunately happens that 
more mercantile knowledge is necessary to the execution 
of this plan than I possess ; so that, like many others, I 
must go without a fortune for want of knowing how to 
get one. That, my good friend, is not your case ; having 
already made one fortune, you certainly know better how 
to make another than a person who has never made any. 
</p><p>
You will find this golden plan enclosed. If the extensive 
concerns in which you are already engaged should render 
its magnitude inconvenient, might it not be well to let our 
friends Le Roy and Bayard share in it ? I mention them, 
because I esteem and like them, and because their acquaintance with the commerce of Holland, and their connexions 
in that country, would afford facilities to all parties. 
</p><p>
At any rate, give me credit for good-will. If this plan 
does not make you more rich, it will not make you less 
merry ; and mirth sometimes does a man as much good as 
money. 
Present my best compliments to Mrs. Cruger. With 
sincere wishes for your and her health and happiness, 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
There is something very pleasant in the reflection, that 
while war, discord, and oppression triumph in so many 
parts of Europe, their domination does not extend to our 
country. I sometimes flatter myself that <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, in 
compassion to the afflicted in these countries, will continue 
to leave America in a proper state to be an asylum to them. 
</p><p>
Among those who have suffered severely from these 
evils, is Monsieur De Rochefoucauld Liancourt, formerly 
president of the National Assembly of France. His rank 
and character are known to you. He will be the bearer of 
this letter, and I am persuaded that his expectations from 
it will be realized.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The negotiation is terminated by a treaty. It will, with 
this letter, go by the packet, which, in expectation of this 
event, has been detained above a week. 
</p><p>
In my opinion we have reason to be satisfied. It is 
expedient that the ratification should not be unnecessarily 
delayed. The best disposition towards us prevails in the 
cabinet, and I hope they will have reason to be content 
with the delicacy and propriety of our conduct towards 
them and the nation. Further concessions on the part of 
Great Britain cannot, in my opinion, be attained. The minister flatters himself that this treaty will be very acceptable to our country, and that some of the articles in it will 
be received as unequivocal proofs of good-will. We have 
industriously united our efforts to remove difficulties, and 
few men would have persevered in such a dry, perplexing 
business, with so much patience and temper as he has 
done. 
</p><p>
I could write you a long letter on these topics, but I 
have not time. Believe me to be, with great esteem and 
regard, dear sir, 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
A letter which I wrote tcyou on the 29th October last, 
contained the following paragraph, viz. : 
</p><p>
" I am authorized by <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a> to assure you, in the 
most explicit terms, that no instructions to stimulate or 
promote hostilities by the Indians against the United States, 
have been sent to the king's officers in Canada. I am preparing an official representation to him on this subject, and 
he will give me an official answer to it ; but as this cannot 
be done in season to forward by this vessel (for letters after 
this day will be too late to go by her), his lordship has 
permitted me to make this informal communication to you 
for your satisfaction. I am to lay before him a statement 
of the evidences relative to the interferences complained 
of, to the end that it may be sent to Canada, and strict 
inquiry made into the truth of the allegations and facts in 
question." 
</p><p>
My time and thoughts have ever since continued to be 
so entirely engrossed by the treaty which is now concluded, 
and was this day signed, as that it really has not been in 
my power to finish and present this representation. 
As to the treaty, it must speak for itself. A hasty letter 
which I have written to Mr. Randolph, contains some 
remarks on a few of the articles in it. That letter is far 
from being so particular as L could wish, but I cannot help 
it. My whole time has been employed. To do more was 
not possible. I wish that I could accompany the treaty, but 
I feel that I ought not to expose myself to the severities of 
a winter's voyage. 
</p><p>
I am exceedingly anxious to return ; for although I have 
every other reason to be satisfied with my situation, yet I 
am not at home. I ought not to conceal from you, that the 
confidence reposed in your personal character was visible 
and useful throughout the negotiation. 
</p><p>
If there is noc a good disposition in the far greater part 
of the cabinet and nation towards us, I am exceedingly 
deceived. I do not mean an ostensible and temporizing, 
but a real good disposition. I wish it may have a fair trial. 
With perfect respect, esteem, and attachment, 
</p><p>

My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My task is done ; whether finis coronat opus, the president, senate, and public will decide. 
</p><p>
This letter goes by the packet, and the treaty with it ; 
some parts of it require elucidation to common readers. I 
have not time for comments ; <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a> is anxious to 
dismiss the packet ; I therefore write in haste. If this treaty 
fails, I despair of another. If satisfactory, care should be 
taken that the public opinion be not misled respecting it, for 
this reason the sooner it is ratified and published the better. 
I really think the good disposition of this country should be 
cherished. I came here in the moment of exultation and 
triumph on account of Lord Howe's victory. From that 
day to this I have experienced no change in sentiments or 
conduct relative to the negotiation. I must, though not 
without reluctance, conclude; not being fit for a winter 
voyage, I shall stay here till spring. Indeed, I shall want 
repairs before I am quite fit for any voyage. God bless you.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I send by the packet the fruit of my negotiation — a treaty. 
I wish that I could go with it, as well that I might again be 
in my own country, as that I might answer questions on 
the subject. The draught has undergone several editions, 
with successive alterations, additions, &c. This shows 
that time and trouble have not been spared. I have just 
finished a hasty letter to Mr. Randolph. It will be thought 
slovenly, but I cannot help it. The packet must go. If I 
entirely escape censure, I shall be agreeably disappointed. 
Should the treaty prove, as I believe it will, beneficial to 
our country, justice will finally be done. If not, be it so — 
my mind is at ease : I wish I could say as much for my 
body, but the rheumatism will not permit me. Health and 
happiness to you, my good friend.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for your obliging letter of the 8th of 
last month, and for the book which accompanied it. As 
yet, I have not had time to give it that regular and attentive 
perusal which it appears to merit. It certainly contains 
much interesting information, and from your accuracy, I 
presume that the facts and statements in it are correct. It 
will naturally lead both our own people and foreigners to 
form a favourable and just estimate of the United States, 
and show in a strong light the policy of maintaining that 
respect for our government and laws, without which our 
local and other advantages can neither be enjoyed nor 
improved. 
</p><p>
The manner in which the insurrection has been dissipated gives me pleasure ; and there is reason to hope that 
the arts and counsels which produced it, will not be able 
to operate such another. 
</p><p>
Our affairs relative to this country have a promising 
aspect. The best disposition towards us prevails here, and 
the indications and proofs of it daily increase. I do really 
believe, that this government means to give conciliatory 
measures with the United States a full and fair trial. I 
wish it may be reciprocated on our part. It never can be 
wise to cast ourselves into the arms and influence of any 
nation ; but certainly it is wise and proper to cherish the 
good-will of those who wish to be on terms of friendship 
and cordiality with us. It may seem strange, and yet I am 
convinced, that next to the king, our president is more popular in this country than any man in it. 
</p><p>
With the best wishes, and with sentiments of esteem and 
regard, I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the pamphlet you was so obliging 
as to send me. It does not appear probable to me that 
Europe is very speedily to be blessed with a general and 
lasting peace, or that the period has already arrived when 
reason and virtue will govern the conduct of the mass of 
mankind. There is much reason to believe that the majority of men are neither reasonable nor virtuous ; and hence 
it has happened, that so many systems which were calculated on the supposed prevalence of reason and virtue, have 
proved delusive. 
</p><p>
The time, doubtless, will come, and is approaching, when 
a new order of things will be introduced, and when, as the 
human passions and vices cease to predominate, the checks 
necessary to control them will become proportionably less 
necessary. To see things as being what they are, to estimate then i accurately, and to act accordingly, are requisites 
no less essential to sound politics than to sound philosophy 
or religion. 
</p><p>
These are general remarks, and not made with reference 
to the political questions agitating in this kingdom, and with 
which (being a citizen of another country) it would not 
become me to interfere. With the best wishes for your 
health and happiness, I am, dear sir,

Dear Sik, 
</p><p>
Your very friendly letter of the 1st November last, gratified me not a little. The insurrections had caused disagreeable sensations in this country. The objects and efforts 
of the Jacobin societies in America were well known here ; 
and the fate of our government was considered as being 
involved in that of the insurrection. The manner in which 
it has terminated has given sincere satisfaction to this government, to whom all disorganizing innovations give alarm. 
Their confidence in your wisdom, decision, and energy has 
been confirmed by the event. 
</p><p>
The institution and influence of such societies among us 
had given me much concern, and I was happy in perceiving 
that the suppression of the insurrection, together with the 
character and fall of similar ones in France, would probably operate the extinction of these mischievous associations 
in America. 
</p><p>
Your remarks relative to my negotiations are just and 
kind, and I assure you nothing on my part has been wanting to render the conclusion of them as consonant as was 
possible to your expectations and wishes. 
</p><p>
Perfectly apprized both of my duty and responsibility, I 
determined not to permit my judgment to be influenced by 
any considerations but those of public good, under the direction of my instructions. / knew and know that no attainable settlement or treaty would give universal satisfaction ; 
and I am far from expecting that the one I have signed 
will not administer occasion for calumny and detraction. 
</p><p>
These are evils, which they who serve the people will 
always meet with. Demagogues will constantly flatter 
the passions and prejudices of the multitude, and will never 
cease to employ improper arts against those who will not 
be their instruments. I have known many demagogues, 
but I have never known one honest man among them. 
</p><p>
These are among the other evils which are incident to 
human life, and none of them shall induce me to decline or 
abandon any pursuits, in which I may conceive it to be my 
duty to embark or persevere. All creatures will act according to their nature, and it is absurd to expect that a 
man who is not upright, will act like one who is. The time will come when all books, and histories, and errors 
will be consumed, and when from their ashes truth only 
will rise, and prevail, and be immortal. 
</p><p>
Among my despatches to Mr. Randolph by this ship, is 
a copy of a letter I have received from <a href='/results.php?tla=jam' rel='colleague'>Mr. Monroe</a> at 
Paris, and of two which I have written to him. The expediency of correcting the mistakes which the French Convention seem to have imbibed, will doubtless strike you. 
</p><p>

Washington, and be assured of the perfect respect, esteem, 
and attachment, with which I am, dear sir,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
After considering all that I have heard and seen on the 
subject, it is my opinion that the common and popular (not 
official) language of America, relative to Great Britain, 
manifested such a disposition as to create serious apprehensions in this country that we should join with the French 
in the war ; that these apprehensions gave occasion to 
secret designs, calculated on such an event ; that in proportion as your views and counsels became developed, 
these apprehensions gradually subsided ; that my mission 
was regarded as a strong proof of your desire to preserve 
peace, and that the perfect and universal confidence reposed 
in your personal character, excluded every doubt of your 
being sincere ; and that this government is not yet entirely 
convinced that a pacific and conciliatory system will be 
supported by the inclination and correspondent conduct of 
the great body of the people. Various circumstances, 
however, induce me to believe, that the cabinet ultimately 
determined to give conciliation a fair experiment, by doing us substantial justice, and by consenting to such arrangements favourable to us, as the national interests and habitual 
prejudices would admit. To relax the navigation act was 
to alarm these prejudices, and therefore was a measure 
which required caution and circumspection, especially in 
the first instance. To break the ice was the difficulty. To 
enlarge the aperture afterward would be more easy ; and 
it will probably be done, if we should be reasonably temperate and prudent. To admit us into their East and West 
India dominions, and into all their continental American 
territories, under any modifications, were decided deviations 
from their former policy, and tended to shock ancient prejudices. Yet these things have been done. None but a 
strong administration would have ventured it. These are 
offerings to conciliation, and include, though not confessedly, 
satisfaction to our claims of justice. 
</p><p>
What passed at Paris on <a href='/results.php?tla=jam' rel='colleague'>Mr. Monroe</a>'s arrival, I am 
persuaded made a strong and disagreeable impression; and 
had not your private character prevented those transactions from being imputable in any degree to your orders, I 
do believe that the system of conciliation would have been 
instantly abandoned. 
</p><p>
What would have succeeded it cannot be easily conjectured ; certainly no treat}' so favourable to us as the present would then have been attainable. Whatever the 
American opinion of it may prove to be, the administration 
here think it very friendly to us ; and that it could not in 
the present moment have been made more so, without 
exciting great discontents and uneasiness in this country. 
</p><p>
The present situation of Great Britain may to us and 
others appear to be perilous, but the ministry seem to have 
no such fears. They have been uniformly bent on prosecuting the war with vigour, and since my arrival I have 
observed no change in that resolution. Even a distinguished leader in the opposition lately told me, that the 
French could not possibly injure the vitals of this country. 
Let it be infatuation or what it will, the government and 
the great majority of this nation meant and mean to continue tin 1 war. I will mention a striking anecdote. 
</p><p>
^i ou have doubtless heard that the merchants concerned 
in the American trade gave me a dinner. The principal 
cabinet ministers were present, and about two hundred merchants. Many toasts were given. "When the "President of 
the United States" was given, it was proposed to be with 
three cheers, but they were prolonged (as if by preconcert, 
but evidently not so) to six. Several other toasts passed 
with great acclamation, particularly " The wooden walls of 
Old England ;" almost every toast referable to America, and 
manifesting a desire of conciliation and cordiality, met with 
general and strong marks of approbation. Towards the 
conclusion of the feast, I was asked for a toast; I gave a 
neutral one, viz., "A safe and honourable peace to all the 
belligerent powers ;" you cannot conceive how coldly it 
was received, and though civility induced them to give it 
three cheers, yet they were so faint and single, as most 
decidedly to show that peace was not the thing they washed, 
— these were merchants. Mr. Pinckney was struck as 
forcibly by it as I was ; and we both drew the same conclusions from it. 
</p><p>
Except an inconsiderable number, the men of rank and 
property, and all whom they can influence throughout the 
kingdom, think the war is indispensable to their safety. 
The dread of Jacobin politics and Jacobin scenes, and the 
expectation that the pecuniary resources of this country 
will ultimately render them superior in the contest, appear 
to be their prevailing motives. 
</p><p>
It was expected by some, that the loss of Holland would 
have damped this spirit, it has had only a partial effect. 
We find the ministry and parliament have been stimulated 
by it to greater efforts. 
</p><p>
All the members who voted for what are called the pacific 
resolutions were not moved, as many of them certainlv 
were, by a mere desire of peace, but by the policy of professing a readiness to make peace, in order that, if spurned 
by the French, the nation might continue in the war with 
more constancy and unanimity. They did not suppose 
that an acceptable peace could, in the present moment, be 
obtained. 
</p><p>
This people appear to think their constitution, and property, and national character and importance as being all at 
stake, and on that stake to be inflexibly determined to risk 
every thing. 
</p><p>
Of the great number who advocated a reform in parliament, there is a portion (but how great cannot easily be 
ascertained) who are so sore, and mortified, and vexed, that 
in my opinion the French successes give them as much 
pleasure as pain. There are men among them whose designs 
as well as whose fortunes are desperate, as well as men 
who have honest designs and good fortunes. These people 
are at present kept from action by the energy of the government, and the unanimity of the great majority of the 
nation as to the necessity of the war. 
</p><p>
The French Jacobins have greatly injured the cause of 
rational liberty. The detestable massacres, impieties, and 
abominations imputable to them, excited in the people here 
the most decided hatred and abhorrence ; and the government by that circumstance rendered the war popular. But 
the system of moderation and justice lately adopted in 
France, the suppression of the Jacobins, and the strict discipline observed in their armies, will doubtless have an 
influence on the sentiments of this nation. I think I see 
traces of this influence already, on minds not suspected 
of it. 
</p><p>
The present war system, however, strikes me as being 
less firm, consolidated, and formidable than it appears to be. 
The administration has been composed more with a view 
to the conciliation of parties than the efficiency of measures. 
I think the system is liable to fluctuation and derangement ; 
from a variety of events and circumstances. Opposition 
to reform, as leading to innovations, is doubtless carried too 
far, and may produce serious consequences. Ideas of the 
rights of man, and the inferences deducible from them, are 
spreading among the people. Veneration for royalty, abstractedly considered, has abated; and although the king 
is popular, yet it is said that the Prince of Wales and the 
Duke of York are not. The prosperity of Britain results 
from, and depends on many causes : complicated machines 
are most liable to derangement. Should there be a scarcity 
of corn, want of employment to the manufacturers, or signal convulsions or disasters in the East or West Indies, or in 
Ireland, or on the sea, the government would find their task 
very arduous. Alarm and distress will abate pride and obstinacy; and when the multitude begin to feel severely, their 
passions frequently take a new and dangerous direction. 
</p><p>
The minister would, I think, have stood on stronger 
ground, if he had taken the first good opportunity of saying explicitly in the House of Commons, that it was France 
who declared war against Great Britain, and not Great 
Britain against France ; and that the government was disposed and ready to make peace whenever France would do 
it on terms compatible with honour and the essential interests 
of Great Britain. To put an enemy in the wrong is to obtain great advantages. The placing and so long continuing 
Lord Chatham at the head of the admiralty — the putting 
the Duke of York at the head of the army — the improper 
liberties taken with neutral nations, for which the Danes 
and Swedes on their part are not yet satisfied — the strange 
measures relative to Ireland, and many other things which 
strike me as blunders, indicate a defect either in the cabinet 
or in the minister. Although united as to the war, yet as 
to the mode of conducting it, the wisest counsels may not 
always prevail. Upon the whole, I shall be surprised if in 
the course of this war, Britain does not reap more thorns 
than laurels, 
</p><p>
I have great reason to believe that the king, the cabinet, 
and nation were never more unanimous in any system than 
in that of conciliation with us ; even Lord Hawkesbury 
does not oppose it. If it should not succeed, they will 
naturally pass, like a pendulum, to the other extreme. 
</p><p>
This system rests principally on their confidence in the 
uprightness, independence, and wisdom of your conduct. 
No other man enjoys so completely the esteem and confidence of this nation as you do ; nor, except the king, is 
any one so popular. The idea which everywhere prevails 
is, that the quarrel between Britain and America w T as a 
family quarrel, and that it is time it should be made up. 
For my part, I am for making it up, and for cherishing this 
disposition on their part by justice, benevolence, and good 
manners on ours. To cast ourselves into the arms of this 
or any other nation would be degrading, injurious, and 
puerile : nor, in my opinion, ought we to have any political 
connexion with any foreign power. 
</p><p>
Before I came here, I had no idea that the king was so 
popular as he is ; his reign having been marked by national 
calamities produced by reprehensible measures. But his 
popularity is owing to his private, rather than his official 
character. As a man, there is much in him to commend ; 
and I have not heard any vice imputed to him. As a 
domestic man, affectionate and attentive to his queen and 
children, and affable to all about him, he is universally 
esteemed. Few men are so punctual in all things. He 
patronizes the arts and sciences. He pays uncommon 
attention to agriculture, and delights in his farms. He lays 
out about ten thousand pounds a-year in improving and 
embellishing the royal estates. He is industrious, sober, 
and temperate, and has acquired much various knowledge 
and information. He converses with ease, and often with 
adroitness, and has an uncommon memory ; they who 
ought to know him concur in these accounts. That he is a 
great and a wise king, I have not heard asserted. That he 
does (to use a vulgar expression) as well as lie knows how, 
seems not to be doubted; but yet some say, that he occasionally is cunning instead of being wise. I have heard 
him described as being a great man in little things ; and 
as being generally well-intentioned, pertinacious, and persevering. 
</p><p>
I congratulate you and our country on the bloodless issue 
of the insurrection ; it is very reputable to the government, 
and to the people ; and exalts both in the estimation of this 
and other nations. 
</p><p>
The tranquillity of the present session of Congress is 
a pleasing circumstance ; but I suspect it has proceeded 
more from their having nothing to differ about, than from a 
spirit of forbearance, or a desire of unanimity. The result 
of my negotiations will doubtless produce fresh disputes, 
and give occasion to much declamation ; for / have no idea 
that the treaty will meet with anti-federal approbation. 
Besides, men are more apt to think of what they wish to 
have, than of what is in their power to obtain. How far 
the rejection of such a treaty would put the United States 
in the wrong ; whether it is consistent with our honour, 
engagements, and important interests ; whether it is 
preferable upon the whole to a war ; are questions which 
require much cool and deliberate consideration, as well as 
more information than many who will decide upon them 
possess. I regret not having had time to make my letter, 
which accompanied the treaty, more full, so as to have particularized and explained the reasons which relate to the 
several articles in it. Then I had not leisure ; to have 
done it since would have been too late, as the fate of the 
treaty would probably be decided before subsequent letters 
could arrive. I still have thoughts of reducing them to 
writing ; and yet there are some among them which should 
not be published, lest the future measures, which they also 
respect, should be thereby marred. I allude, for instance, 
to the free navigation of the St. Lawrence. 
</p><p>
Mr. Randolph does not see the West India article in the 
same light that I do: it breaks the ice, that is, it breaks in 
upon the navigation act. The least stream from a mass 
oi' water passing through a bank will enlarge its passage. 
The very article stipulates that the arrangements to succeed it shall have in view the further extension of commerce. This should not be too nicely discussed in American or English newspapers; for though liberal and enlightened people will admit such extensions of commerce to be 
beneficial to both countries, yet all ancient prejudices must 
be delicately managed. ■ There are many men who have 
less wisdom than power, and more integrity than political 
information. The restriction not to carry certain articles 
to Europe, &c, is confined to the United States and the 
British islands. From other places, we may freely carry 
them. Deposites of French and Spanish sugars, &c, may 
be made in the Dutch, Danish, or other islands ; and thence 
carried where we please. English sugars, cotton, cocoa, 
and coffee will probably not be more than our consumption 
requires ; and all cotton brought into our country should be 
there manufactured.

Thus, my dear sir, I have passed part of this day very 
agreeably in writing to you this long letter ; and the pleasure is increased by the opportunity it affords me, of assuring you how cordially and sincerely I am

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been favoured with yours of the 14th instant. It 
gives me pleasure to observe, that good-will towards 
America seems to prevail generally in this kingdom, and I 
hope the further progress of conciliation will not be retarded 
by indiscretions in either country. 
Your sentiments, relative to the imperfections of human 
nature and human governments, are but too well founded. 
Governments calculated on an idea that the great majority 
of any people are reasonable and virtuous will, in many 
respects, prove detective. Governments calculated on the 
opposite extreme will be severe and oppressive. When 
it is considered that not only all who form plans of government, and all who govern, and all who are governed, are 
imperfect, but also that too many of them are neither wise 
nor virtuous, we cannot be surprised that political as well 
as moral evil should abound more or less in every part of the 
world. Perfection is beyond our reach; all that can be 
hoped for in this world is a state of the least imperfection. 
</p><p>
With the best wishes for your welfare,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been honoured with yours of the 31st of last month. 
The article in the treaty, to which you allude, viz. the last, was proposed by me to <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a>, because it seemed 
probable that when the treaty should for some time have 
been in operation, defects might become manifest, and further arrangements become desirable, which had not occurred 
to either of us ; because no plan of an article relative to 
impressments, which we could devise, was so free from 
objections as to meet with mutual approbation ; and because 
the lord-chancellor's proposed article, relative to alienism 
and other interesting objects, was of such magnitude, that I 
did not think any stipulations respecting them should be 
ventured, until after that article had received the most 
mature consideration of our government. 
</p><p>
I think that in endeavouring to obtain a new modification 
of the 12th article, an extension of tonnage, from 70 to 100 
tons, should be attempted : for although this was strenuously pressed before, yet I can see no inconvenience in 
repeating it, by way of experiment — not insisting on it as 
an ultimatum. In my opinion, it would also be expedient 
that the new article should specify the particular commodities which our vessels shall be permitted to carry from the 
United States to the British islands, and import from the 
latter into the former. 
</p><p>
As to the impressment of seamen, the forming of any a ery 
satisfactory arrangement on that head will, I fear, continue 
to prove an arduous task. In my opinion, Great Britain, 
should at present agree not to take any seamen from our 
vessels on the ocean, or in her colonial ports, on account of 
the injuries thence resulting to our navigation. It would be 
difficult to support the position, that she ought to agree not 
to seek for and take her own seamen, on board of any 
merchant vessel in the ports of Great Britain or Ireland. 
</p><p>
In the India, or 13th article, " It is expressly agreed, that 
the vessels of the United States shall not carry any of the 
articles, exported by them from the said British territories, 
to any port or place, except to some port or place in America, where the same shall be unladen." I would propose, 
that after the word America, be added, or to some foreign 
port or -place in Asia. There is, indeed, nothing in the 
article as it now stands, which restrains the India Company's government from continuing to permit our vessels to 
carry cargoes from India to China; but it would be better, 
if possible, to establish this as a right by express agreement. 
</p><p>
For my own part, 1 regard the present moment as unfavourable for negotiations with Great Britain. Although 
she has reason not only to approve, but to admire the conduct of our government, yet while it appears doubtful to 
her, whether the sentiments and dispositions of the great 
body of our people are pacific and friendly, or otherwise, it 
seems natural to suppose that it will be her policy to be 
reserved. To multiply engagements with, and facilities to 
us under such circumstances, might be ascribed to her apprehensions ; and as her government will doubtless perceive 
this risk, I suspect they will be strongly inclined to avoid it. 
</p><p>
Besides, I should doubt the policy of introducing into the 
negotiation atpnscnt, either so many or such propositions 
as may defer the ultimate ratification so late, as to prevent 
orders to evacuate the posts by the 1st of June next, from 
being sent in due season. 
</p><p>
The commercial part of the treaty may be terminated at 
the expiration of two years after the war ; and in the mean 
time, a state of things more auspicious to negotiation will 
probably arrive, especially if the next session of Congress 
should not interpose new obstacles.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have lately received much intelligence from several quarters. Some allowances are 
to be made for zeal ; but all my accounts agree in representing the public mind as becoming more and more composed, and that certain virulent publications have caused 
great and general indignation, even among many who had 
been misled into intemperate proceedings, and had given 
too much countenance to factious leaders. The latter, 
however, persevere with great activity, though with less 
noise and clamour. These are political evils, which, in all 
ages, have grown out of such a state of things, as naturally 
as certain physical combinations produce whirlwinds and 
meteors.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
A friend of mine lately sent me your address to your constituents relative to the treaty. I have read it with 
pleasure. Had all the publications on that subject been written with equal knowledge and attention, or with equal 
candour and decorum, more truth would have been disseminated, and less irritation excited. 
</p><p>
I observe in it the following paragraph, viz. " Objections both personal and constitutional have been made to <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel=''>Mr. Jay</a>. He has been said to be prepossessed in favour of 
Britain, and an avowed enemy to France. If this had been true, it would have been a sufficient reason for rejecting 
him — but it is not true. I can contradict it, and do, on my own knowledge. I heard <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel=''>Mr. Jay</a> express, in public and 
private, and those who have been much more and much longer acquainted with him, assure me that he always has expressed the utmost pleasure in the French revolution, and 
the warmest wishes for its success ; the greatest dislike for the former government, and sentiments of the highest esteem and respect for the nation." 
</p><p>
I am much obliged to you, sir, for this vindication ; but 
it being summary and in general terms, and comprehending 
only one of the points, I think it best, in order to obviate all 
further questions, to state particularly my sentiments relative to them both. 
</p><p>
It has, for obvious reasons, been judged convenient to 
represent me as being strongly attached to the interests of 
Britain, and as being equally hostile to those of France. 
Before I take notice of either, I will premise, that as it is 
my duty, so it is my inclination and resolution, never to be 
a partisan of any foreign court or nation, but to be and 
remain with those independent and genuine Americans, who 
think it unwise and improper to meddle in foreign politics, 
and who regard all foreign interference in our counsels as 
derogatory to the honour, and dangerous to the best interests of the United States. 
</p><p>
Not being of British descent, I cannot be influenced by 
that delicacy towards their national character, nor that partiality for it, which might otherwise be supposed not to be 
unnatural. I nevertheless continue to concur in, and to 
express those sentiments of esteem for that nation, which 
are expressed, and I believe with great sincerity, in the 
early journals of Congress. 
</p><p>
It is not from the characters of this or that administration, or prevailing party in the government, that the character 
of a nation is to be inferred. A true judgment of it can no otherwise be formed, than by observing the general 
tenor of their dispositions and conduct, viewed under all their circumstances and in all their relations, during a 
long course of time. It certainly is chiefly owing to institutions, laws, and principles of policy and government, 
originally derived to us as British colonists, that, with the favour of Heaven, the people of this country are what they are. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the tendency which all arbitrary governments, and particularly the long reign of such a monarch 
as Lewis the Fifteenth, have to debase and corrupt their 
subjects, the people of France continued to be highly distinguished by their talents, and by their progress in the arts 
both of peace and of war. 
</p><p>
It is true that 1 returned from that country to this, with 
opinions unfavourable to their court; but not only without 
a wish unfriendly to them, but. on the contrary, with sentiments of good-will and regard. That I have from early 
life expressed a strong dislike to the former arbitrary government of France, is well known. The more I became 
acquainted with it, the more it appeared to me to be a government always dreadful in theory, and always more or 
less so in practice, according to the characters of those by 
whom its powers were exercised. 
</p><p>
In the revolution which put a period to it, I did cordially 
rejoice : I mean the one which limited the powder of the king, 
and restored liberty to the people. The patriotic Assembly 
which concerted and accomplished that revolution, and the 
people and army who concurred in and supported it, did 
themselves immortal honour ; and impressed me (although 
my judgment did not accord with all their acts) with great 
respect and esteem for them, and with the w 7 armest wishes 
for the ultimate success and perfection of the constitution 
and government which they established. 
</p><p>
The successors of that memorable Assembly produced 
another revolution. They abolished the constitution and 
government which had been just established, and brought 
the king to the scaffold. 
</p><p>
This revolution did not give me pleasure. I derived no 
satisfaction from the disastrous fate of a prince, who (from 
whatever motives) had- done us essential services, and to 
whom we had frequently presented the strongest assuranccs of our attachment and affection. This revolution 
had, in my eye, more the appearance of a wo than a blessing. It has caused torrents of blood and of tears, and been 
marked in its progress by atrocities very injurious to the 
cause of liberty, and offensive to morality and humanity. 
</p><p>
But this revolution having abolished the monarchy, declared France a republic, and received the general concurrence of the nation, a new constitution became indispensable: 
and as, in case this revolution should be overthrown by the 
combined powers, they would doubtless dictate what that 
new constitution should be (an interference not to be submitted to), I wished success to the revolution, so far as it 
had for its object not the disorganizing and managing of 
other states, which ought neither to be attempted nor permitted, but the exclusive ordering of all internal affairs, and 
the establishment of any constitution which the nation should 
prefer. It gives me pleasure to find that one has lately 
been so established ; and I sincerely wish it may be the 
means of giving permanent peace, liberty, and good government to France. 
</p><p>
As to the issue of the war, I am far from desiring that 
either France, Britain, or Germany, or any other power, 
should acquire a decided preponderance in Europe. In my 
opinion, it would conduce more to the welfare and peace 
of those nations, and also of the United States, that they 
should remain in capacity to limit and repress the ambition 
of each other. 
</p><p>
I will conclude this letter with an extract from one which 
I wrote to the late secretary of state, dated at London, on 
21st November, <a href='/results.php?year=1794'>1794</a>, viz: — 
</p><p>
" I daily become more and more convinced of the general 
friendly disposition of this country towards ours ; let us 
cherish it Let us cultivate friendship with all nations. By treating them all with justice and kindness, and 
by preserving that self-respect which forbids our yielding 
to the influence or policy of any of them, we shall, with the 
Divine blessing, secure peace, union, and respectability." 
</p><p>
With sentiments of esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, sir, 
Your most obedient and humble servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been favoured with yours of the 15th inst. by 
M r. Parkman ; am much pleased with him and his fellowtraveller, Mr. Cooledge. Their representation of the state 
of things in Massachusetts corresponds with the hints on that 
head suggested in your letter. There is too much intelligence in the northern states, to admit of their being greatly 
and long deceived and misled ; and I hope the same remark 
will in time become equally applicable to all the others. 
Considering the nature of our governments, a succession of 
demagogues must be expected : and the strenuous efforts 
of the wise and virtuous will not cease to be necessary to 
frustrate their artifices and designs. They will always be 
hostile to merit, because merit will always stand in their 
way ; and being actuated by envy, ambition, or avarice, 
and not unfrequently by them all, will be diligently at 
work, while better men will take their rest. 
</p><p>
It seems strange, but so it is in all republics, that many 
excellent men who are happy in their families and fortunes, 
and in the esteem of society and of their friends ; who enjoy their villas and their gardens, and neglect not to guard 
their trees and vines from caterpillars, and their favourite 
plants and flowers from nipping frosts ; yet omit attending 
to the political grubs, who are constantly and insidiously 
labouring to wound and prey upon the roots of all their temporal enjoyments. Several gentlemen of this description with us becoming alarmed, have been very useful ; 
and I presume this has been, more or less, the case in other 
States, 
Be assured of the esteem and regard with which I am, 
</p><p>
Yours, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am much obliged to you for the books you have been so 
kind as to send me, and which, with your friendly letter of 
the 11th inst., were delivered to me yesterday. Except 
while at church, I have employed this day in reading 
the first, and part of the second volume ; and expect to 
finish the perusal of the remainder next Sunday. I have 
long been of opinion, that the evidence of the truth of 
Christianity, requires only to be carefully examined to produce conviction in candid minds ; and I think they who 
undertake that task, will derive advantages from your 
enumeration of many interesting facts ; your remarks on 
various heads and topics ; and from your references to the 
numerous authors proper to be consulted, and some of 
whom are but little known. 
</p><p>
As to " The Age of Reason," it never appeared to me to 
have been written from a disinterested love of truth, or 
of mankind : nor am I persuaded, that either of those motives induced certain characters to take such singular pains 
to distribute and give it reputation and currency in this 
country. Religion, morality, and a virtuous and enlightened clergy, will always be impediments to the progress 
and success of certain systems and designs ; and therefore 
n ill not cease to experience both direct and indirect hostilities from those who meditate or embark in them, 
With the best wishes for your health and happiness, I am, 
dear sir,

My Lord, 
</p><p>
The great questions which have agitated this country 
since my arrival, may now, I think, be considered as determined. I will therefore no longer postpone thanking your 
lordship for the letter which you did me the honour to 
write on the 11th May last, respecting which I shall omit 
saying any thing further by this opportunity. 
</p><p>
The treaty will go into operation, and be supported by a 
great majority of the people; a majority comprising the 
greater part of the men most distinguished by talents, 
worth, and weight. Strenuous endeavours were made and 
persisted in, to mislead the people by all the various means 
which art, unrestrained by principle, very readily devises. 
The English and Irish emigrants joined the opposition ; and 
what seems more singular is, that the French republicans 
and French refugees, so far forgot their animosities as to 
concur in resisting the restoration of good-will between 
Great Britain and the United States. 
</p><p>
Anxious that the present current of public opinion in 
favour of a paciiic and conciliatory system, may not be 
checked by fresh obstacles, permit me, my lord, to submit 
to your consideration the prudence, as well as justice of 
strong measures, to prevent, as far as possible, those very 
exceptionable impressments, and other severities, which too 
often occur. They may give occasion, and I am persuaded 
will continue to give occasion to more clamour than facts 
will justify ; but it is certainly true that much just cause for 
complaint does exist, and that there are persons here who 
would rejoice if there was much more. There is reason to 
believe, that certain individuals in the British service have 
been irritated, by the improper things said and published in 
this country, to indiscreet acts of resentment ; not considering, and probably not suspecting, that they were said and 
published for the purpose of provocation. It is to be wished, 
that they had recollected that these things were not said 
and published by our government, nor by those who desire 
to promote, and who do promote peace and harmony with 
Great Britain ; nor by those who are actuated by zeal for 
the honour and interest of their own country. 
</p><p>
We have aimed at, and laboured for the restoration of 
mutual justice and mutual good-will between our countries. 
The greatest difficulties are surmounted, and perseverance, 
with prudence and temper on both sides, will ensure success. Would not orders to discharge all impressed Americans, and enjoining a just and friendly conduct towards the 
people of this country, cherish their confidence, and manifest 
that disposition to conciliation, which repeated instances of 
violence and severity enable designing men (and with great 
appearance of reason) to draw into question ? Would not 
friendly assurances on these points to our government, tend 
greatly to impress the public with still more favourable 
opinions of the propriety and policy of their measures ; and 
consequently diminish the credit and influence of those who 
seize every occasion of impeaching their wisdom and your 
sincerity ? These men have, indeed, for the present missed 
their object, but they have not abandoned their designs. I 
mean the leaders, not the rank and file of the party. Among 
the latter are many misled, honest men, who, as they become undeceived, will act with propriety. 
</p><p>
Pardon, my lord, the liberty I take in these observations. 
I write freely because I confide fully in your candour, and 
because I flatter myself that you confide in mine. I have 
not leisure, at this moment, to be more particular. This 
letter will soon be followed by others. 
</p><p>
With great and sincere esteem and regard, I have the 
honour to be, my lord, 
</p><p>
Your lordship's most obedient 
</p><p>
And humble servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Mr. Thomas Hancock delivered to me yesterday your 
obliging letter of the 23d of last month. I shall always be 
happy in opportunities of manifesting to the family of the 
late Governor Hancock, my respect for his memory. We 
were fellow-labourers in the American revolution, and I 
reflect with pleasure on the good understanding which subsisted between us, and the friendly attentions with which 
he uniformly honoured me. Permit me to add, that my 
esteem and regard for you would not only ensure a welcome 
reception to this amiable young gentleman, but to any others 
you may recommend. 
</p><p>
The approbation of one judicious and virtuous man, relative to the conduct of the negotiations in which I was 
lately engaged, affords me more satisfaction, than all the 
clamours raised on that subject by intrigue and passion 
have given me concern. It was foreseen that a strenuous 
opposition would be excited ; and I was disappointed only 
in this, that the management of it has been less circumspect 
and politic than I had supposed. There was little reason 
to expect that any treaty of amity with Great Britain, 
which our constituted L r *>vernment could form, would be 
acceptable to those anti-federalists, whose prejudices, instead 
of being removed, but gathered strength and malignity 
from the failure of their predictions ; to debtors, anxious 
by any means to elude payment, or to partisans of a 
foreign power, which had systematically and industriously 
laboured to keep us in the condition of a satellite, and prevent our ever diverging from the sphere of her attraction 
and governing influence. 
</p><p>
Believing the people of this country too intelligent to be 
long deceived, and not sufficiently vicious to require great 
national calamities, I hope and trust that <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> will 
continue to bless us with as much prosperity as will be 
good for us ; I say as will be good for us, for in my opinion 
Agur's prayer is not less suitable for nations than for 
individuals. With the best wishes for your health and 
happiness, I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and humble servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The letters of the 24th and 28th November last, with 
which you favoured me, have remained long unanswered, 
though not forgotten ; my time having, since my arrival, 
been so occupied by public concerns, that I have had no 
leisure to attend to my private affairs or correspondence. 
</p><p>
As to political reformations in Europe or elsewhere, I confess that, considering men as being what they are, I do not 
amuse myself with dreams about an age of reason, prior to 
the millennium, which I believe will come, though I cannot 
tell the precise time when. Until that period arrives, I 
expect there will be wars, and commotions, and tyrants, 
and factions, and demagogues, and that they will do mischief as they may have opportunity. Human knowledge 
and experience will doubtless continue to do good, in proportion to their extent and influence ; but that they will 
ever be able to reduce the passions and prejudices of mankind to such a state of subordination to right reason as 
modern philosophers would persuade us, I do not believe 
one word of. 
</p><p>
I should not think that man wise, who should employ his 
time in endeavouring to contrive a shoe that would fit every 
foot ; and they do not appear to me much more wise, who 
expect to devise a government that would suit every nation. 
I have no objections to men's mending or changing their 
own shoes, but I object to their insisting on my mending or 
changing mine. I am content that little men should be as 
free as big ones, and have and enjoy the same rights ; but 
nothing strikes me as more absurd than projects to stretch 
little men into big ones, or shrink big men into little ones. 
Liberty and reformation may run mad, and madness of any 
kind is no blessing. I nevertheless think, that there may 
be a time for reformation, and a time for change, as well as 
for other things ; all that I contend for is, that they be done 
soberly, by sober and discreet men, and in due manner, 
measure, and proportion. It may be said, that this cannot 
always be the case. It is true, and we can only regret it. 
We must take men and things as they are, and act accordingly ; that is, circumspectly. 
</p><p>
With the best wishes for your health and happiness, 
I am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for your friendly letter of the 14th 
March last. I am happy in resuming my correspondence 
with my friends in England, and regret that it has been so 
long suspended. As <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='colleague met'>Mr. King</a> will be the bearer of this 
letter, I refer you to him for information respecting the 
state of affairs here. You have heard of the appointment of 
this gentleman to succeed Mr. Pinckney. You are well 
acquainted with his qualifications for that place, and with his 
character, public and private. 
</p><p>
I thank you for making to <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a> the intimation 
I requested relative to the intended present. I shall deem 
myself sufficiently honoured and gratified, if my endeavours 
should prove conducive to permanent peace and conciliation between our countries. This can, and I hope will, be 
accomplished. Nature has made few difficulties within 
the sphere of honest and rational policy, that are insuperable to prudence and perseverance. Mutual justice, mutual 
kindness, and a little mutual forbearance will ensure success. But it is to be remembered, that political, like other 
fields, require constant attention ; when neglected, they 
soon become unproductive, and fresh weeds, briers, and 
thorns will gradually spring up. 
</p><p>
The tide in human affairs, of which the poet speaks, now 
runs favourably, and will present a proper occasion for 
arranging our West India commerce. The war has, in a 
great degree, suspended the importance of it to us. When 
that suspension ceases, a strong sense of it will return, and 
will excite uneasiness which should be obviated or allayed by 
regulations as satisfactory as can well be made. Although 
a system more liberal than that in the twelfth article, if it 
had been immediately made, might have been ascribed to 
the pressure of circumstances, rather than to motives more 
pleasing and friendly : yet that objection has nearly lost its 
force, and passed its time ; for the treaty is now in operation, with the approbation of a decided and great majority 
of the people, and success attends your arms. 
</p><p>
While America has no just cause of complaint against 
Britain, nor Britain against America, their commercial and 
friendly relations will operate freely and effectually, and the 
designs of those who aim at discord between them will 
prove abortive. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Yours very sincerely,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It gave me pleasure to receive from Dr. Edwards your 
letter of the 7th ult., and to converse with him on the subjects alluded to in it. My letters to you and others on 
your side of the water have, since my return, been few, 
and not very interesting. The risks to which letters are 
exposed in times like these, rendered me more reserved 
than I should otherwise have been. 
</p><p>
You have doubtless by this time heard that Mr. Benson 
has been chosen the third commissioner for ascertaining 
the river St. Croix, intended by the treaty of peace. He 
is now on that business ; a better appointment could not 
have been made. Whatever the decision may be, both 
parties will, I am persuaded, have reason to be satisfied 
with it. 
</p><p>
You are now placed, as you well observe, in a situation 
delicate and important. Your reflections on it are just and 
proper. The interest I take in what concerns you induces 
me to enlarge a little upon them. 
</p><p>
To settle and agree on the principles which ought to 
govern in the capture cases, as well as the application of 
them to those cases, will require great care, consideration, 
and impartiality. The majority of the commissioners 
being Americans, the honour of our country will be increased or diminished by their decisions. I flatter myself 
they will be such as to merit the approbation of distant and 
disinterested generations in both countries. 
</p><p>
It is natural that the claimants should, and they doubtless 
-will be, sanguine in their expectations. Some of them 
may be difficult to satisfy, and perhaps become clamorous. 
Firmness, therefore, as well as integrity and caution, will 
be requisite to explore and persevere in the path of justice. 
They who, in following her footsteps, tread upon popular 
prejudices, or crush the schemes of individuals, must expect clamours and resentment. The best way to prevent 
being perplexed by considerations of that kind is to dismiss 
them all, and never to permit the mind to dwell upon them 
for a moment. I suspect it is with men in these cases, as it 
is said to be with women in certain others, they who hesitate 
are in danger of being lost. 
</p><p>
Although a judge may possess the best talents, and the 
purest intentions, yet let him keep a jealous eye over his 
sensibilities and attachments, lest they imperceptibly give 
to error too near a resemblance to truth. Nay, let him 
even watch over that jealousy, for the apprehension of 
being thought partial to one side, has a tendency to incline 
a delicate mind towards the other. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Very sincerely your friend,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been favoured with yours of the 14th ult. and 
also with the one which accompanied the set of your 
Geography, for which be pleased to accept my thanks. 
</p><p>
It gives me pleasure to learn, that you will endeavour at 
least to prepare for a history of the American revolution. 
To obtain competent and exact information on the subject 
is not the least arduous part of the task ; it will require 
much time, patient perseverance, and research. As the 
revolution was accomplished by the councils and efforts of 
the Union, and by the auxiliary councils and efforts of 
each individual State or colony, it appears to me that your 
inquiries will necessarily be divided into those two departments; the first of thorn will of course include foreign 
affairs, and both of them will naturally divide into two 
others; viz. the civil and the military. Each of these, 
you know, comprehends several distinct heads, which are 
obvious. 
</p><p>
So much of our colonial history as casts light on the 
revolution, viewed under its different aspects, and considered in all its anterior relations, will be essential. I 
think our colonial history is strongly marked by discriminating circumstances relative to our political situation and 
feelings, at three different periods : 1st, down to the revolution under King William ; 2d, from thence to the year 
<a href='/results.php?year=1763'>1763</a> ; and 3d, from that year to the union of the colonies 
in <a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a>. Want of leisure will not permit me to go into 
details. 
</p><p>
As to documents — public and private journals of Congress — the papers mentioned or alluded to in them, such 
as certain reports of committees ; letters to and from civil 
and military officers, ministers, agents, state-governors, &c; 
the proceedings of the standing committees for marine, 
commercial, fiscal, political, and foreign affairs — all merit 
attention. 
</p><p>
The journals and papers of State conventions, and councils of safety, and of some of the standing and other committees, during the revolutionary government, contain much 
interesting information. 
</p><p>
There are also diaries and memoirs, and private letters, 
which would give some aid and light to a sagacious and 
cautious inquirer ; for experience has convinced me, that 
they are entitled to no other respect or attention than what 
they derive from the well-established characters of the 
writers for judgment, accuracy, and candour. As to characters, I have, throughout the revolution, known some who 
passed for more than they were worth, and others who 
passed for less. On this head, great circumspection is particularly requisite. It is to be regretted, but so I believe 
the fact to be, that except the Bible, there is not a true history in the world. Whatever may be the virtue, discernment, and industry of the writers, I am persuaded, that 
truth and error (though in different degrees) will imperceptibly become and remain mixed and blended, until they 
shall be separated for ever by the great and last refining 
fire. 
</p><p>
I remain, my dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your very obedient servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received and read with pleasure your elegant 
eulogium on the late Mr. Rittenhouse. Such attentions to 
worthy characters, cherish and encourage modest merit. 
As a man and a philosopher, his title to esteem and praise 
is, I believe, universally acknowledged. 
</p><p>
The "Illustrations of the Prophecies" which you mention, 
I have not seen. On my return to New-York I will inquire 
for it. The author's applying certain of the prophecies to 
certain recent events, renders his work the more interesting. 
I have frequently known this to be done with more imagination than judgment, but from your account of the book, 
I presume it is not liable to that remark. The subject 
naturally excites attention, and the present extraordinary 
state of things permits an idea to slide into the mind, that 
even additional events, admitting of a like application, may 
precede a general peace. 
We live, my dear sir, in times that furnish abundant 
matter for serious and profound reflections. It is a consolatory (me, thai every scourge of every kind by which 
nations are punished or corrected, is under the control of a 
wise and benevolent Sovereign. 
</p><p>
With sincere esteem and regard, 1 am, dear sir,

My Lord, 
</p><p>
A long interval has passed between the date of my last 
letter and that of this. They would have been more 
frequent, had they been exposed to less risk of interception. 
</p><p>
My respect and esteem for your lordship remain unabated, 
and I yet flatter myself with the pleasure of becoming a 
better correspondent. It will give you satisfaction to know 
that the letters I have received from <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='colleague met'>Mr. King</a> and Mr. Gore, make honourable mention of the candour and good 
faith of your government. They both appear to be well 
pleased, and I am glad of it. The proceedings of the 
Congress now in session will doubtless be sent to you. 
There appears to be a general disposition to pacific measures throughout our country. If it procures peace, so 
much the better ; if not, we shall be the more united. To 
put our adversaries in the wrong is always a valuable point 
gained, especially as the forbearance necessary for the purpose will not in the present instance be prompted by fear, 
nor produce dejection. 
</p><p>
In every event, some malcontents are to be expected ; 
and it is remarkable that patriots born in British dominions, 
are very distinguishable among those who the most invariably oppose our government and its measures. They 
appear to be as little disposed to promote good-will between 
our two countries, as the French ; indeed, they seem to like 
</p><p>
our government as little as they did their own. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, with very great respect, esteem,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had this afternoon the pleasure of receiving your favour 
of the 18th inst. Mrs. Jay joins me in sincerely congratulating you and your amiable family on your arrival in this 
country ; may your expectations of happiness in it be fully 
realized. 
</p><p>
The reasons which have determined you to settle on the 
Kennebeck, I can easily conceive are cogent, but I natter 
myself you will sometimes find leisure for excursions this 
way. 
</p><p>
I presume that our political sentiments do not differ 
essentially. To me it appears important that the American 
government be preserved as it is, until mature experience 
shall very plainly point out very useful amendments to our 
constitution ; that we steadily repel all foreign influence and 
interference, and with good faith and liberality treat all 
nations as friends in peace, and as enemies in war ; neither 
meddling with their affairs, nor permitting them to meddle 
with ours. These are the primary objects of my policy. 
The secondary ones are more numerous, such as, to be 
always prepared for war, to cultivate peace, to promote 
religion, industry, tranquillity, and useful knowledge, and to 
secure to all the quiet enjoyment of their rights, by wise 
and equal laws irresistibly executed. I do not expect that 
mankind will, before the millennium, be what they ought to 
be ; and therefore, in my opinion, every political theory 
which does not regard them as being what they arc, will 
probably prove delusive. 
</p><p>
It will give me pleasure to receive the publication you 
mention; being from your pen, it will, I am persuaded, be 
interesting. Be pleased to present our best compliments 
to Mrs. Vaughan and your sister.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I received, three days ago, by the post, your letter of the 
7th of August, in which was a copy of the one you had 
written on the 20th of July, and the original of which I had 
received and read with pleasure. 
</p><p>
The difficulty and delicacy of your task, my good friend, 
are obvious; but I natter myself the reputation to be derived 
from it will soften the trouble and anxiety it gives you. It 
was not to be expected that the judgments of the commissioners would not frequently differ, for the best judges 
sometimes vary in opinion from each other ; but it is to be 
expected, as well as wished, that their decisions may bear 
the test of the severe examination which they will certainly 
at one time or other undergo. 
</p><p>
The delays of the court of admiralty do not surprise me. 
I have no faith in any British court of admiralty, though I 
have the greatest respect for, and the highest confidence in 
their courts of justice, in the number of which, those courts 
do not deserve to be ranked. I do not extend this stricture 
to the lords of appeal. 
</p><p>
The question you hint at is interesting. Perhaps a mode 
might be devised for making and receiving claims de bene esse; but if any thing of that kind should be done, it should 
be on more mature consideration than that on which I suggest it ; it is a thought which just occurred to me, and 
which I have not examined. 
</p><p>
I am settled here with my family, at least for the winter. 
The Legislature have determined that this city shall be the 
seat of government, and that the principal public offices 
shall be here. 
</p><p>
As to politics, we are in a better state than we were : 
but we are not yet in a sound state. I think that nation is 
not in a sound state whose parties are excited by objects 
interesting only to a foreign power. I wish to see our 
people more Americanized, if I may use that expression; 
until we feel and act as an independent nation, we shall 
always suffer from foreign intrigue. 
</p><p>
Whether peace in Europe would ensure peace to America, 
is a question on which doubts are entertained. In my opinion, 
it will depend on circumstances, and not on any right or 
wrong about the matter. 
</p><p>
Remember me to our friends, <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='colleague met'>Mr. King</a>, and Mr. Gore. 
I owe letters to them, and to others, but the fate of letters 
has been so precarious, that I have written much fewer 
than I should otherwise have done.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I consider myself much obliged by your friendly and 
interesting letter of the 28th ult. From Talleyrand's expressions and conduct it seems, and I infer, that, he will act 
as favourably towards us as may consist with his personal 
views, for I have very little confidence in his being governed 
by any moral principles, further than they may be conveniently adopted. As to Otto and La Forest, I entertain 
of them in that respect very similar sentiments ; they 
will probably be inclined towards us as far as may suit 
them. 
</p><p>
The recent explosion at Paris has cast most of our calculations and conjectures, relative to the issue of our negotiations with the Directory, very much into the air. A 
complete state of defence at home, appears to me to be the 
only solid foundation on which to rest our hopes of security, 
and I regret that more has not been done towards it. But 
until our people become more united, and feel more sensibly 
the pride and the duties of independence, our Jacobins will 
not cease to perplex the measures of our government, 
however wise and salutary. It is pleasing to observe, that 
notwithstanding their efforts to mislead, the public mind is 
gradually recovering from its errors, and to this end your 
public reports and letters have essentially contributed. 
Your answer to the Spanish minister's factious and indecent 
letter, has made stronger impressions than he and his counsellors probably suspect. 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I was this morning favoured with yours of the 27th inst. 
I regret the circumstances which prevented our seeing each 
other when you were here. There are several topics on 
which I wish to converse with you, and particularly 
respecting military arrangements at New-York. The rifle 
corps, and a few of the new light-infantry companies are 
established. There were reasons which I shall mention 
when we meet, which induced me to suspend a decision 
relative to the others for the present. The objections stated 
in the petition are not, in my judgment, conclusive. So 
soon as the commissions advised by the council are despatched, I propose to set out for New- York. The defence 
of the port, &c., in my opinion, should be under your direction. The measures will be concerted between us. The 
council will meet again before the session, and all such new 
corps as ought to be established, will then without difficulty 
be organized ultimately. I think with you on the subject 
of resignations. 
</p><p>
It is with me a question whether any person convicted 
of forgery ought to be pardoned at present, when offences 
of that kind abound. As yet I have not pardoned any 
convicts of that description, except in cases where the convictions turned on a balance of evidence, and where guilt 
w T as probable, but not certain. Mr. Murray has just been 
with me on this subject. I shall take it into further consideration, but fear the objections will prove insuperable. 
The young man's father and family are to be pitied, but the 
power to pardon is a trust to be exercised on principles of 
sound discretion, combining policy, justice, and humanity ; 
— we will talk this matter over. I have an idea of puttkig 
the light corps into a regiment, and making our friend Troup colonel of it. 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You will herewith receive copies of the acts of our two 
last sessions. A variety of official and other affairs, which, 
although in numerous instances of little importance, yet 
required to be despatched with punctuality, induced me, 
from time to time, to postpone replying to your obliging 
letter of the 19th November, and to thank you for the 
interesting pamphlets you was so kind as to send with it. 
</p><p>
We see many things, my dear sir, which might be altered 
for the better, and that, I believe, has been the case at all times. But at this period, there certainly are an uncommon number and series of events and circumstances, which 
assume an aspect unusually portentous. The seeds of 
trouble are sowing and germinating in our country, as well 
as in many others; they are cultivated with a zeal so 
singularly blind, as not, in many instances, to be easily 
accounted for. Infidelity has become a political engine, 
alarming both by the force and the extent of its operations. 
It is doubtless permitted to be used for wise ends, tho 
we do not clearly discern them ; when those ends shall be 
accomplished, it will be laid aside. 
</p><p>
Much ill use has been, and will yet be made of secret 
societies. I think with you that they should not be encouraged, and that the most virtuous and innocent of them 
would do well to concur in suspending them for the present. 
</p><p>
What precisely is to be understood of the death and 
resurrection of the witnesses, will probably be explained 
only by the event. I have an idea, that cither the Old and New Testaments, or the moral and revealed law are the twin 
witnesses : witnesses to the existence, attributes, promises, 
and denunciations of the Supreme Being. Atheism is now 
killing these witnesses. That all true and pious apostles 
or believers are everywhere or generally to be slain, seems 
hardly credible. Whatever or whoever the witnesses may 
be, it is certain that the slaughter is not yet perfected. I 
much doubt whether, in any view of the subject, the clergy 
of the church of Rome are of the number. 
</p><p>
The pope has lost his triple crown, and his spiritual 
dominion is rapidly declining. The Turk is now a party 
to the war ; whether any or what consequences will result 
from it to Mahomet, is yet to be seen. Wide is the field 
open for conjectures. 
</p><p>
That our country is to drink very deep of the cup of 
tribulation, I am not apprehensive ; but that we shall entirely escape, does not appear to me very probable. I 
suspect that the jacobins are still more numerous, more 
desperate, and more active in this country, than is generally 
supposed. It is true, they are less indecorous and less 
clamorous than they have been. How few of their leaders 
have abandoned their errors, their associations, their opposition to their own government, and their devotion to a 
foreign one ! Why, and by whom, were the Kentucky and 
Virginia resolutions contrived, and for what purposes ? I 
often think of Pandora's box : although it contained every 
kind of evil, yet it is said that hope was placed at the bottom. This is a singular fable, and it admits of many, and 
some of them very extensive applications. 
</p><p>
With very sincere esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The letters which you were so obliging as to write to me 
from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> have been received, and disposed of in 
the manner you requested. 
</p><p>
The information communicated in those letters has given 
me much concern. The expediency of the president's 
declaration, that he would not send another minister to 
France, until he should receive assurances, &c, was not, 
in my judgment, unquestionable. There are political considerations against it, and there are others in its favour. 
Such a declaration, however, was made, and the propriety 
of it seems to have been acquiesced in. 
</p><p>
It is to be wished that Mr. Murray had been more reserved in his conversations with the French secretary, on 
the subject of our national differences. These matters 
were foreign to his department, and I presume they were not within his instructions. Those conversations have 
facilitated overtures, which are calculated, and I believe 
designed, to perplex and divide our councils, and to mislead 
public opinion. 
</p><p>
The manner in which Mr. Murray transmitted these 
overtures to the president, is such a deviation from the official 
and customary course, as (unless adopted for extraordinary 
and substantial reasons) is certainly exceptionable. Nor 
does any reason occur to me, why the president thought it 
proper to omit communicating the overtures to the secretary of state. Such is my confidence in the patriotism of 
the president, and also of the secretary, that every indication of want of confidence between them appears to me 
singular, and to be regretted. 
</p><p>
Whether these overtures (considered in connexion with 
the before-mentioned declaration of the president, and other 
existing circumstances) should have been accepted, or encouraged, or rejected, or neglected, a iv questions not free 
from doubts. I am inclined to think that immediate attention 
to them was neither necessary nor advisable, and that they 
had not as yet acquired such a degree of maturity, as to call 
for any formal, national act. But viewing this subject in all 
its various relations, I suspect it is one of those on which 
statesmen might naturally be led to opposite opinions, by 
the difficulty of estimating the precise weight and balance 
of the many and diverse considerations comprehended 
in it. 
</p><p>
Much might be said, but not to much purpose ; for whatever remarks maybe applicable to the origin, progress, and 
present state of this perplexing affair, it is as it is. Nothing 
thorefore remains, but to make the best of the situation into 
which we are carried, and to avail ourselves of all the 
advantages to be derived from the united talents and efforts 
of the best friends to our country and government. The 
apprehensions entertained from the projected negotiation 
may not be extensively realized, and events may yet arise 
to press the Directory into proper measures relative to this 
country— measures not to be expected from their sincerity, 
or sense of decorum or justice. 
</p><p>
I am for aiding and adhering to the president, and for 
promoting the best understanding between him and the 
heads of the departments. Notwithstanding what has happened, I hope his real friends will not keep at a distance 
from him, nor withhold from him that information, which 
none but his friends will give him. Union, sedate firmness, 
and vigorous preparations for war, generally afford the best 
means of counteracting the tendencies of insidious professions, and of too great public confidence in them. 
With great esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It was not until the last week, that I had the pleasure of 
receiving from Mr. Naylor your obliging and very friendly 
letter of the 24th Feb., <a href='/results.php?year=1798'>1798</a>. Accept my thanks for it. 
</p><p>
Permit me to congratulate you on the promising aspect 
of affairs in Europe. England stands high, and while just, 
no one ought to repine at her prosperity. In my opinion, 
she does not pass for more than she is worth. \ our tax 
on income does honour to the minister who devised it, to 
the parliament who adopted it, and to the people who bear 
it. If hereafter accommodated to a state of peace, it would 
be a powerful auxiliary to your sinking fund. 
</p><p>
Our conversation here turns so much on Great Britain 
and (as some phrase it) her doings, that I find myself insensibly led to these interesting topics. Not only Great Britain, but every other civilized country, will have reason to 
rejoice when the present atrocious war, and the pestiferous 
principles which generated and have protracted it, shall 
cease to distress and to corrupt mankind. May that happy 
period not be distant. 
</p><p>
With great esteem and regard, and the best wishes for 
your health and happiness, I am, dear sir,

Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the sermon on the death of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>General Washington</a>, which you was so obliging as to send me. 
In my opinion, it abounds in excellent sentiments, well 
arranged and expressed. Writing thus freely, I think it 
candid to observe, that in some instances ideas are conveved which do not appear to me to be correct ; such, for 
instance, as " our glorious emancipation from Britain." 
The Congresses of <a href='/results.php?year=1771'>1771</a> and <a href='/results.php?year=1775'>1775</a> regarded the people of 
this country as being free ; and such was their opinion of 
the liberty we enjoyed so late as the year <a href='/results.php?year=1763'>1763</a>, that they 
declared the colonies would be satisfied on being replaced 
in the political situation in which they then were. It was 
not until after the year 17 03, that Britain attempted to subject us to arbitrary domination. We resisted the stamp act 
with energy and success ; and when afterward she claimed to 
bind us in all cases whatever, the same spirit of resistance 
animated' our councils and our conduct : when she recurred 
to arms to put a yoke upon us, we recurred to arms to keep 
it off. A struggle ensued which produced the revolution, 
and ended in an entire dissolution of all the political ties 
which had before subsisted between the two countries. 
Thus we became a distinct nation; audi think truth will 
justify our indulging the pride of saying, that we and our 
ancestors have kept our necks free from yokes, and that the 
term emancipation is not applicable to us. 
</p><p>
Speaking of the measures of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>General Washington</a>'s civil 
administration, you observe, and so is the fact, " that there 
is less unanimity among his countrymen with respect to 
these, than with respect to his military services." But, do 
facts warrant our ascribing this diminution of unanimity 
entirely to doubts respecting the wisdom of those measures? 
The revolution found and left only two primary parties, 
viz. the whigs who succeeded, and the tories who were 
suppressed. The former were unanimous in approving 
the leading measures, both civil and military, which gave 
them victory. When the adoption of the new constitution 
afterward came into question, the whigs divided into two 
parties, the one for and the other against it. The party for 
the constitution prevailed ; and they have with as great 
unanimity approved of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>General Washington</a>'s civil as of 
his military measures and services. The party opposed 
to the constitution disapproved of the government established by it ; and there are very few of the important 
measures of that government which have escaped their 
censure. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty of making these remarks from the respect I have for your talents ; and an opinion, that with due 
circumspection they will promote the great interests of 
truth, virtue, and national liberty. Receive them, therefore, as marks of the esteem with which I am, sir,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Several affairs, more interesting to others than to me, 
have for some months past so pressed upon me, as, together 
with official business, to leave me little leisure to attend 
even to my own concerns. Hence I have been constrained 
into delays respecting my correspondents, which could not 
have been less agreeable to their feelings than to my own. 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the several communications with 
which you have favoured me. The facts which you have 
given to the public relative to the conduct of France in our 
revolution, as well as your strictures on the designs and 
intrigues of the illumines, have, to a certain extent, been 
useful. They have made proper impressions on many 
sedate and candid men, but I suspect they have detached 
very few of the disciplined adherents of the party. As 
yet, there appears but little reason to believe that philosophism is losing ground in our country. There is indeed 
less said about it, but indications of immorality are neither 
less frequent, nor more odious and disgraceful in common 
estimation than heretofore. A moral epidemic seems to 
prevail in the world. What may be its duration, or the 
limits of its ravages, time only can ascertain. 
</p><p>
The approaching general election in this State will be 
unusually animated. No arts or pains will be spared to 
obtain an anti-federal representation, in order to obtain an 
anti-federal president, &c. and through him divers other 
objects. 
</p><p>
The late revolution in France does not appear to have 
dissipated the clouds which veiled from our view the fate 
of that and other countries. As yet, I see little reason to 
expect the restoration of the Bourbon family ; nor is it 
certain that great good would result from it. Of the issue 
of the present interesting campaign, no satisfactory conjectures can yet be formed; and nothing at present appears 
which presents a fair prospect of a speedy termination of 
the miseries of Europe. Your envoys in France will probably succeed; but whether that success would ultimately 
promote our tranquillity and happiness, is a point on which 
many judicious men differ in opinion. 
</p><p>
We have lost much in <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>General Washington</a>, whose death 
you and others have made the subject of eloquent discourses. From the state of our parties and affairs, some 
are persuaded that he has been taken from evil to conic It 
may be so ; but I fear that such apprehensions are sometimes indulged too far, and that they often disqualify men 
from meeting either good or evil in a becoming manner. 
With great esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant.

Sir, 
</p><p>
On my return from New-York on Friday last, your 
obliging letter of the 5th of May, which arrived here during 
my absence, was delivered to me. I am much gratified by 
the information it contains, and thank you for it. 
</p><p>
Serious apprehensions were entertained that anti-federalism had gained considerable ground in Massachusetts, but 
I am happy to find from the facts you state, that appearances do not warrant the conclusions which have been 
drawn from them. 
</p><p>
The present aspect of our affairs is far from being agreeable. Although peculiarly blessed, and having abundant 
reason for content and gratitude, our nation is permitting 
their happiness to be put in jeopardy by the worst passions, 
inflamed and directed by the most reprehensible means. 
Whether the good sense of the people will avert the dangers which threaten them, is yet to be seen. If the sound 
and leading friends of their country could concur in opinion 
as to men and measures, their efforts would probably be 
successful ; but unfortunately, there is too little unanimity in 
many points, and the want of it exposes us to the hazard 
of many evils. 
</p><p>
It really appears to me that the mission of our envoys to 
France has been treated with too much asperity. The 
president declared to the Congress that he would never 
send another legation to Paris, until he received assurances 
that it would be properly respected. As that declaration 
seemed to imply that when he should receive such assurances he would again send envoys, it was not unnatural 
that he should conceive himself bound in honour to do so. 
This attachment to the dictates of honour and good faith, 
even supposing it to have been too scrupulous, is amiable 
and praiseworthy. Whether that declaration was advisable, 
and whether the nomination of the envoys was made exactly in season, are questions which, like others of the same 
kind, may receive different answers from different men ; 
but having nominated the envoys and received the requisite 
assurances, I, for my part, consider the sending them as a 
matter of course, and I do not concur in opinion with those 
gentlemen who think they should nevertheless have been 
detained. 
</p><p>
I regret that my absence deprived me of the pleasure of 
seeing the Rev. Mr. Andrews, and the more so, as he 
would have answered my inquiries respecting many of my 
friends at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and informed me of your health. 
</p><p>
With the best wishes that you may now and long enjoy 
that valuable blessing, I am, sir,

Si;<, 
</p><p>
I had yesterday the pleasure of receiving fro»i the secretary of state, the letter which you did me the honour to 
write on the 22d May last. 
</p><p>
They who feel an interest in the honour of this country, 
cannot fail of being gratified by every mark of respect to 
the memory of our late president. The tribute of commendation paid to his merits by so many respectable persons in Great Britain, is no less honourable to them than to 
him ; and I verv sincerely concur with you in wishing that 
</p><p>
V ml J O 
</p><p>
the best understanding may always subsist between our 
two nations. 
</p><p>
The fac simile copies of the letters appear to me to be 
well executed, but I am not certain that the taste of this 
country is such as to produce a considerable demand for 
them. I shall immediately put the cards and subscription 
papers into the hands of such persons here, and at NewYork, as I think most like!}" to promote the object of them. 
For my own part, I am preparing and expect to retire in 
the spring to my estate at Bedford, in the county of Westchester, about fifty miles from the city of New- York. I 
shall request the persons to whom the subscription papers 
will be delivered, to transmit them to Mr. Hugh Gaine, a 
bookseller of reputation at New-York ; and shall request 
him to communicate the result to Messrs. Nicoll, &c, in 
London. 
</p><p>
Having, since my return from England, been constantly 
engaged in official affairs, I have had little leisure for other 
pursuits ; so much so that I have not, from that time to this, 
visited my estate more than twice in any one year. 
</p><p>
A member of your board (of whose address 1 took a 
memorandum, which I have since often looked for without 
success) was so obliging as to send me a cask of Ejxs;lish i. I promised to try it, and inform him whether it 
succeeded. It was ground, and sent 10 my farm, where a t of it was used in like manner with French and New-mdland gypsum, but not with the like success ; it produced no visible effect. On being acquainted with this, I 
directed the remainder to be saved, in order that on my 
removal there. ight be tried under my own direction : 
</p><p>
if I live, this shall be done. 
</p><p>
I lasl : read with attention your proposal for an experimental farm. The objects in view are certainly very 
interesting, and to a considerable degree attainable under 
the direction of such a manager as I suspect it would be 
more easy to describe than to find. It would probably be 
advisable to make him a band- llowance percent, on the profits, besi vy. 
</p><p>
This country will dern - from all your improvements relative to the breed and management of livestock. But I apprehend that, from the difference between 
your climate and ours, it will in some respects be less easy 
for us to apply and put into practice your improvements 
respecting the growth and cultivation of plants. 
</p><p>
In the year <a href='/results.php?year=1784'>1784</a>, I had an interesting conversation with 
one of your intelligent farmers in Essex. He was surprised that we in this country seldom sowed more than one 
bushel of wheal on an acre. On being told that in our good 
land one seed would produce many shoots or straws, he 
observed thai we had better sow an additional bushel, for 
thai tiiese shoots were generally loss productive than single 
straws from single grains. On my return that year to this 
country, I mentioned the remark to some of our best 
farmers. One of them in particular gave it a fair trial for 
several years. He increased his seed in various experiments, from one bushel to above two bushels per acre ; but 
he finally found and was convinced that not more than one 
bushel and a half per acre could be sowed on his farm with 
advantage : any quantity above that filled the field with too 
much st 'aw. Hence I conclude that (all other tilings being 
equal) the sari iber of gi ains of seed w heat will thr »w out more shoots in this climate than in yours. 
</p><p>
But to return to the experimental farm: it appi -me that such an establishment comes naturally within the department of the agricultural society; and if instituted by 
them, would enjoy greater advantages, than such an establishment if entirely independent and distinct from th 
would posses. 
</p><p>
The more food Great Britain produces, the better; and 
it is plain that by cultivating all your waste lands, and by 
still greater improvements in husbandry, the quantity annually produced may and will he exceedingly augmented ; 
yet, sir, it is not quite clear to me, that Great Britain can 
always continue to produce more food than she will consume. You now manufacture for about five millions of 
people in this country, and for many millions in other countries. Consider the rapidity of population in this • untry, 
and in some parts of your extensive empire. Your manufacturers must increase, and they must have food. On this 
topic much might be said, which will readily occur to you. 
With great respect and esteem, I am, sir,

Rev. Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for your obliging letter of the 9th ult., 
and the interesting discourse which accompanied it. The 
eighteenth century has been distinguished, as you observe, 
by great events. There are some i them so singular 
</p><p>
and apparently so ominous, that the presenl centurj will 
probably not be less signal than the last; especially as 
whole nations are suffering themselves ed from 
</p><p>
their great sovereign by promises of liberty made to them 
by the servants of corruption, and are desiring and exalting 
rulers who contemptuously refuse to " kiss the Son." 
</p><p>
I perfectly agree with you in the sentiment, that our 
business is to do our duty, and leave events to Him, without whose appointment and permission nothing comes to 
pass. That duty, however, appears to me to call particularly on all the ministers of the gospel, to look more to the 
Author and Finisher of our faith than to the expositors of 
it ; and, disregarding the doubtful and mysterious doctrines 
by which the latter have divided Christians from Christians, 
to unite in defending the plain and intelligible faith delivered to us by our Redeemer and his apostles. 
</p><p>
With great respect, and the best wishes for your health 
and happiness,

My dear Daughter, 
</p><p>
I passed a part of yesterday morning very agreeably in 
writing a letter to you. Happy to learn from your brother 
and sister that your health was fast improving, and well 
knowing the innocent gratifications you were deriving, 
probably "in long perspective" from your dear little boy, 
my letter insensibly grew long, nor could I easily quit these 
-i ML!- topics. 
</p><p>
Last night, I received Mr. Banyer's letter of the 27th. 
You can judge of my feelings on the occasion. It has cast 
a gloom on both families. I have to lament the departure 
of my only grandson, as well as the affliction of my dear 
and affectionate daughter. It is natural that such events 
should excite grief in a high degree; I know this by 
experience, and I know by experience also, that no 
consolation is to be derived from any other source than 
acquiescence in and resignation to the will of God, without whose appointment or permission nothing comes to 
pass.

very best wish that you or I could have formed for him. 
was, that after a long and virtuous abode bore, he might be 
where he now is. We have indeed reason to grieve for 
the comforts we lose by his absence, but not that he is 
where he is. His happiness is now certain, complete, eternal. Happy shall we all be to arrive finally at the same 
blest abodes; and there to be received by him, and many 
others of our best and dearest friends and kindred. 
</p><p>
Let us all endeavour to become the wiser and be ter f< r 
these chastisements; and remember the expressions of Job 
when all his children w T ere taken away from him. 1 wish, my 
dear Maria, to comfort both you and myself. Let us both 
consider these things, and hold fast our confidence in Hirn 
who alone can console and bless us.

I am, .my dear Maria,

Your very affectionate father,

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been favoured with your letter of the 2d ultimo, 
respecting the African Free-school in the city of New-York. 
It is, in my opinion, a charitable and useful institution, and 
well entitled to encouragement and support. From your 
account of its present embarrassments, I am induced to think 
that, in order to its being and remaining on a respectable 
and permanent footing, some vigorous and well devised 
measures should be in ken to obtain adequate and durable 
funds. The uncertain donations occasionally solicited and 
expected from charitable, but scattered and unconnected 
individuals, will, probably, be always incompetent, and 
must obviously be too precarious to afford ground for seasonably calculating the prudence and extent of expenditures. 
</p><p>
The existing debts should doubtless be paid : indeed they 
cannot be paid too soon, and it is desirable that new ones 
be not contracted. For my part, I am persuaded that it 
can very seldom be discreet, for institutions depending on 
charity to contract debts, and then apply to charity to pay 
them. 
</p><p>
What should be done? is the question. Two things 
occur to me, which I will take the liberty to suggest. 
</p><p>
First, The society of Friends in general, and particularly 
those in New- York, have given more patronage to the 
objects connected with this school, than any other society 
or denomination in the State ; and. from circumstances 
peculiar to their association and discipline, they are enabled to pursue and accomplish their objects with more than 
ordinary union and effect. 1 fence, 1 am led to believe, that 
it those of your society in New-York would recommend 
this school to the notice and liberality of their brethren in 
the country, and desire them also to requesl the aid of all 
-disposed persons, of other denominations, in their 
respective neighbourhoods, a considerable sum might he 
collected; especially considering the prudence, as well as 
zeal, with which your affairs arc usually managed. On this, 
or any other plan which would in some degree be general 
through the country, 1 would readil) be one of the contributors. 
</p><p>
aidly. I submit to your consideration the expediency 
of regularly putting at interest one-tenth of the annual 
income of the school, whatever it may he, and wh ; :ver 
it may arise, and invariably to bring the yearly e\ 
ot the school to a level with the remaining nine-tenths. ( In 
this plan both the principal of the stable funds, and the income of the school (so far as if comprehended the interest 
ol those lends) would increase from year to year. In time, 
the interest alone would form an income so considerable, as 
to be productive of more good, than if the institution had 
continued to depend and subsist on scanty and precarious 
supplies. 
</p><p>
It may also be well to consider, whether the benevolent 
objects of this institution might not be promoted by an act 
of incorporation, with such provisions in it as would conduce to its stability, and extend its usefulness. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to inform me whether any particular attention 
is paid by the superintendents to the children after they 
have left it, and whether it is part of th plan to endeavour 
to have them bound out to trades, or to service in decent 
families. To me it appears important that they be not left 
entirely either to their parents or to themselves; it being 
difficult to give them good morals, manners, or habits, in 
any other way than by placing them under the care and 
direction of persons better qualified for those purposes than 
their parents generally are. 
</p><p>
With esteem and regard, I am, sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>

My dear Maria, 
</p><p>
The account of your health contained in your affectionate 
letter of the 12th inst., gave me great pleasure. 
</p><p>
I thank you for the manner in which you mention my 
birth-day, and I believe every word you say on that topic. 
And now, my dear daughter, I will congratulate you on 
the anniversary of a birth-day, without which all our birthdays would have been but sad. I mean the nativity of our 
Redeemer. May you see many returns of that anniversary, 
and with still increasing prospects of comfort here, and 
happiness hereafter. 
</p><p>
Last evening your sister received a letter from you, with 
a postscript by ****. Let me hint to you, that neither the 
letters which we write, nor those which we receive, should 
be so frequently communicated as to become a matter of 
course; for, in that case, every omission which prudence 
may require, will naturally lead to conjectures and apprehensions, and sometimes to inquiries and piques, which are 
always unpleasant. Although I am persuaded that these 
reflections are not new to you, yet my solicitude about 
whatever may affect your comfort, prompts me to remind 
you of them. Place full confidence in your husband ; with 
respect to others, be habitually circumspect. These are 
mere general remarks, and not dictated by any fear of their 
being necessary.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It was not until within a week that I received your 
friendly letter of the 7th November last. It expresses sentiments of esteem and regard which, being mutual, excite 
agreeable recollections and emotions. 
</p><p>
" War in Disguise," of which you was so good as to 
enclose a copy, has given occasion to uneasiness relative to 
the matter and design of it. It contains marks of ability, 
but the author has not been entirely circumspect. I enclose 
an answer to it, written, as is supposed, and as I believe, 
by a gentleman of excellent talents and good dispositions.* [* Gouvemeur Morris.]
</p><p>
It appears to me, that every independent state has, as 
such, a perfect right at all times, whether at war or at 
peace, to make grants to and treaties with any other independent state ; but then those acts, in order to be valid, 
must consist with justice, and be in no respect fraudulent. 
To the validity of such grants and treaties, no third power, 
whether belligerent or neutral, can, in my opinion, have 
reasonable cause to object. 
</p><p>
When such acts are fraudulent, and injurious to others, 
those others are justifiable in regarding them as being 
what they are (that is, fraudulent), and in acting accordingly. When such acts are just and fair, but abused to the 
injury of others, those others have a right to complain of 
and to attack the abuse, but not the thing abused. 
</p><p>
Whether this or that particular act (of the description 
alluded to) be fair or fraudulent, is a question to be decided 
by evidence internal and external, according to the rules 
and maxims of the laws of nations relative to such cases. 
</p><p>
Believing these principles to be well founded, they do 
not permit me to adopt some of the opinions of this ingenious 
writer, nor to approve of all the latitude contended for by 
some of his opponents. To view in their various lights 
and relations, and to examine properly all the doctrines and 
positions in question, cannot be done within the compass of 
a letter. 
</p><p>
Your disposition and desire to promote good- will between 
our two countries exactly accord with my own. It is to 
be wished that each of them may ever be mindful, that the 
preservation of friendship between nations, as between individuals, requires justice and prudence always, and even forbearance sometimes ; for states, as well as persons, commit 
errors. It is our lot to live in perplexing and eventful 
times. The passions of men are not good counsellors, and 
never less so than when agitated and inflamed. 
</p><p>
We have seen concluded, with the treaty of Amiens, the 
first act of the astonishing tragedy which the French revolution has introduced on the theatre of the world. The 
present and succeeding acts will probably be highly interesting and impressive. In this prodigious drama, Great 
Britain still sustains a conspicuous and important part : 
perhaps she may be employed to restrain the " remainder of 
wrath." Whether this distant nation is to appear among 
the dramatis persona;, cannot now be known. We certainly do not desire it. 
</p><p>
The inconveniences apprehended from the death of Mr. Pitt will doubtless be diminished, if not obviated, by the 
general confidence reposed in your new administration. I 
am glad to find that <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a> holds a distinguished 
place in it. My respect and esteem for him continue undiminished. 
</p><p>
Very sincerely do I congratulate you on your domestic 
felicity. May it continue and increase. I thank you for 
what you have briefly remarked on that topic ; for you 
have given me pleasure, by letting me see how much reason you have to be pleased. 
</p><p>
With true esteem and regard, I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your faithful and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. As your letter was so long on the way, this answer 
will arrive, if it arrives at all, much later than you expected. 
Being anxious to remove appearances of inattention, I shall 
send a duplicate by another vessel. There will then be a 
double chance of its coming to your hands.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter gave me great pleasure, and the more, as it 
leads me to expect that of seeing you here when a favourable opportunity shall offer. 
</p><p>
I apprehend that several of your remarks relative to 
public affairs are too well founded ; and it is natural that 
they should be so. The operations of certain principles 
and passions are nearly alike in all ages and countries. 
</p><p>
Every modification of sovereignty has its inconveniences 
— there is a better and a worse in them all, and no other 
than a relative perfection in any of them. That ours might 
be rendered less imperfect is more easy to prove than to 
accomplish. It is true, that when the measure of confusion 
runs over, order usually follows ; but it is not always such 
order as would please either you or me. 
</p><p>
The vices and violences of parties, mid the corruptions 
which they generate and cherish, are serious evils ; but 
they are evils which, during the full tide of democracy, 
mere reason will find it difficult to correct, because the 
majority of every people are deficient both in virtue and in 
knowledge. All parties have their demagogues, and demagogues never were nor will be patriots. Self-interest excites and directs all their talents and industry, and by that 
principle they regulate their conduct towards men and 
measures : nor is this all ; they not only act improperly 
themselves, but they diligently strive to mislead the weak, 
the ignorant, and the unwary ; as to the corrupt, they like 
to have it so ; it makes a good market for them. 
</p><p>
Reforms in government are more freo^ently imposed by 
overbearing circumstances, than produced by the influence 
of wisdom on the opinion and choice of the multitude. 
The administration of every government will always be 
able, virtuous, and salutary, or otherwise, according to the 
characters of those to whom it may be committed. The 
rulers in democratic republics are generally men of more 
talents than morals ; there can be but little connexion between cunning and virtue, and therefore (except now and 
then in particular instances) our affairs will commonly be 
managed by political intrigues, calculated upon that " auri 
fames" which, from obvious causes, rages in this country. 
</p><p>
New men, new objects, and now designs, will successively arise and have their day ; but whether for good or 
for evil, we know not. At present, democracy prevails 
too much ; the time may come when it will prevail too 
little. The human passions naturally vibrate between extremes, passing and repassing, but seldom stopping at the 
middle point. 
</p><p>
Things are as they are, and we must make the best of 
them ; as travellers do or ought to do, well knowing that 
in the course of a long journey, they cannot expect to 
have every day fine weather, good inns, good roads, and 
good company. Nothing remains for us but to do our 
duty to our country with prudent and unabated zeal ; to 
enjoy with gratitude and cheerfulness the good we have ; 
and to bear with decencv and dignitv the ills which we 
cannot avert or remove. What may be our duty will 
depend on the circumstances of the day. Those of the 
present day appear to me a little singular in some respects. 
</p><p>
As to the ensuing election for governor, a federal candidate should, in my opinion, have been named. If that had 
been deemed inexpedient, the federal party should, I think, 
have adopted an unequivocal plain line of conduct relative 
to the present candidates, explicitly deciding to vote for 
neither of them ; or openly resolving to support the one 
whom they considered as the least objectionable. In what 
state the election will place our party, is difficult to conjecture, for although advantages will result from it, yet 
"Timco dona fe rentes." 
</p><p>
With great esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant,

Jonx Jay.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your letter of the 2d inst., and expected 
to have answered it this week in person. 3Iv health had 
so much mended, that on Friday last, I rode to Bedford 
for the first time since my return. That ni^ht, rheumatic 
pains in my head, neck, and shoulders came on. They 
have somewhat abated, but still confine me to the house, 
In our journey through life, as in other journeys, our wishes 
cannot always be gratified. Travellers must expect to live 
and fare like travellers. 
</p><p>
You have the gout, and you extract consolation from it ; 
this is good moral chymistry. My rheumatism and your 
gout may perhaps carry us home the farthest way round, 
but not in an easy chair. When we " ruminate past enjoyments," we taste that tincture of melancholy which their 
departure and other associated circumstances infuse : it 
nevertheless affords a kind of pleasure which, like some 
medical wine, is not only better than no wine, but perhaps 
in some respects more salutary than pure wine. 
The half a century you speak of, has given us some 
knowledge and experience, both of men and things. That 
experience leads me to concur cordially in your idea of 
cultivating sentiments of friendship ; and particularly to 
cherish those with which I am, 
</p><p>
Yours, very sincerely,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I received by the last mail, and have read with great 
pleasure, your obliging letter of the 1 1th inst. The information it conveys cannot fail of being grateful to all who prefer 
the wise and upright policy which distinguished the administration of Washington, to that which of late has distressed 
and disgraced our country. How fir the favourable changes 
which have taken place are imputable to patriotic and correct principles, time and experience only can decide. Sincerely do I wish that all our elections may manifest the 
prevalence of such principles ; but I am not sanguine in my 
expectations of it. Personal and pecuniary considerations 
appear to have acquired a more than ordinary degree of 
influence. Many sacrifices of public good have, and will 
yet be made to them. On the exertions of the virtuous and 
intelligent much will always depend ; should they become 
relaxed, by a sense either of security or of fatigue, we shall 
probably lose the ground we have gained. I brought with 
me into retirement the same affection for our country by 
which I have always been actuated, and you rightly judge 
that nothing which is of importance to the public can be a 
matter of indifference to me. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Soon after receiving your letter of the 18th of September 
last, I was called to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> by the death of the only remaining child of my daughter, whose grief for the loss of her 
son and of her husband was still fresh and severe. 
</p><p>
I returned on the 3d of November with a pain on my 
side, which the doctor ascribed to an obstruction in the 
liver. The complaint increased, and kept me in close confinement during the winter and spring. It reduced me to 
such a state of debility, that I have as yet regained only 
sufficient strength to ride two or three miles at a time. I 
am better, but not well, and it is uncertain whether I ever 
shall be ; such mementoes are useful, though unpleasant, and 
therefore I ought to make the best of them. 
</p><p>
Your remarks relative to plaster will induce me, if I live, 
to extend the application of it to' the various objects you 
mention. I directed it to be freely used in the garden this 
spring, and am pleased with the results. The effect of 
plaster on vegetation is to me a mystery ; if it acts only by 
attracting water, why does the ground (as some say) grow 
tired of it, and require a supply of common manure to 
renew the efficacy of it. Often-repeated experiments, and 
long continued observation, naturally lead to important discoveries ; but the very limited duration of human life rarely 
allows sufficient time for the talents and perseverance of 
any individual to arrive at their "ne plus." Here the antediluvians had the advantage of us, and many of them doubtless made the most of it. Hence it may be presumed that 
they carried many of the useful arts, as well as those which 
belong to the departments of vice, to a higher degree of 
perfection than they are at present. To me it does not 
appear improbable, that the celebrated works of remote 
antiquity, were not a little indebted to information which 
passed through the flood. 
</p><p>
National interest unites, with other considerations, in 
drawing our attention to agriculture. I think it has greatly 
improved in our country since the revolution, and there is 
reason to believe that the " resuscitation" you are attempting would be generally useful. I wish it may be effected, 
but unless a number of gentlemen, well qualified for the 
purpose, will heartily and diligently unite with you, I fear 
your endeavours will not be so successful as they are commendable. 
</p><p>
You are right in supposing that we are much of an age. 
In December next, I shall have lived sixty-four years — a 
long course of years when to come — a dream when past. 
But whether life is, or is not composed of " such stuff as 
dreams are made of," it is a valuable gift, and is capable of 
many enjoyments, to be found by all who rationally seek 
and use them. Among the enjoyments which men derive 
from each other, those which arise from such social intercourse as you allude to, certainly are to be placed in the 
first class. This class, however, like the first class of almost 
every species of good, has more items in theory than in 
actual experience. 
</p><p>
I think with you that the Spaniards deserve credit for 
the spirit they have exhibited. There are fine points in 
their character. In a conversation respecting them, with 
the late Abbe Mably, he said, " Monsieur, ils sont plus 
hommes que nous." This was a great deal for a Frenchman to say. I sincerely wish them success, but my expectations of it have not been sanguine. Their hatred of 
France, and their attachment to their religion, &c, may 
continue to stimulate their indignation and their valour; 
but it does not appear to me that their opposition has been, 
or probably will be, so managed as to prove effectual. As 
yet, there has been no display of civil or military talents 
equal to the occasion; we may guess, but we cannot 
prophecy. 
</p><p>
Perilous times have descended upon all Europe, and Bonaparte seems to be the Nebuchadnezzar of the day. Divines 
say, that in prophetic language nations are called seas. 
According to that language, Europe is a tempestuous and 
a raging ocean ; and who can tell which of the governments 
afloat upon it will escape destruction or disaster ? Some 
dark clouds from that tempest have reached, and lately 
obscured, our political sky ; nor has it again become quite 
serene and clear. This country, as well as others, will 
experience deep distress ; but I do not believe that you or 
I will live to see it. From transitory and ordinary evils 
we cannot expect to be exempt. We may suffer from rash 
experiments, from the pressure of fraternal embraces or 
resentments, from the machinations of demagogues, and 
gradually from the corruption incident to the love of money, 
&c; but, for my own part, I do not apprehend any thing 
like the speedy approach of an " overturn." You have had 
a democratic tornado at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. It did but little 
harm ; perhaps it did some good. I found it gave you 
something to do ; and I found also, as I expected, that you 
did it. Too many in your State, as in this, love pure 
democracy dearly. They seem not to consider that pure 
democracy, like pure rum, easily produces intoxication, and 
with it a thousand mad pranks and fooleries. Ebriety, 
whether moral or physical, is dillicult to cure ; and the more 
so, as such patients cannot easily be convinced of the value 
and the necessity of temperance and regimen. 
</p><p>
I observe that I have written a long letter. Feeling a 
little fatigued, I must forego the pleasure of adding much 
to it. It is pleasant to think loud in safe company, and I 
sometimes allow myself that indulgence in writing. 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On the 28th ult. I received your letter of the 1st of August last, and I thank you for it, and for the pamphlets 
enclosed with it. 
I am well persuaded that your sentiments relative to me 
are such as you describe ; and I assure you that mine relative to you correspond with them. 
</p><p>
The patrons of the abolition act, and of the African Institution, certainly do honour, and will probably do more than 
ordinary good to Great Britain ; against whom complaints 
have ascended both from Asia and Africa. It is pleasing 
to behold a nation assiduously cultivating the arts of peace 
and humanity in the midst of war, and while strenuously 
fighting for their all, kindly extending the blessings of Christianity and civilization to distant countries. 
</p><p>
That your and our governments should co-operate in 
rendering their respective laws against the slave trade 
effectual, is to me very desirable, and I believe that a convention for the purpose would be approved by all, who 
think and feel as you and I do respecting that base and 
cruel traffic. Whether the times are propitious to such a 
convention, is another question. Negotiations are said to 
be pending between our government and Mr. Jackson. I 
can discern no objection to his being instructed to propose 
such a measure. They who offer to do what is fit and right 
to be done, cannot be losers by it. I can do but little — 
that little shall be done. 
</p><p>
The information you give me respecting your family, 
and your friendly inquiries concerning mine, gratify me 
not a little. I rejoice that while perturbation reigns abroad, 
you enjoy in tranquillity at home the comforts mentioned 
in the 128th Psalm. 
</p><p>
In my family there have been, since the date of my last 
letter, some painful and some pleasing events. Death has 
deprived my eldest daughter of an excellent husband, and 
of the only two children which she had. On the other 
hand, my son has gradually recovered his health, and has 
married an amiable young lady, who, about a year ago, 
brought him a son. My other children- are well, and doing 
well. 
As to myself, sickness confined me to the house last winter, and I am still more of an invalid than a convalescent. 
However difficult the task, such visitations should be received and borne with grateful, as well as patient resignation. 
</p><p>
The observation you cite from Hooker is very just, and 
so are your remarks on this turbulent and transitory scene. 
To see things as they are, to estimate them aright, and to 
act accordingly, is to be wise. But you know, my dear 
sir, that most men, in order to become wise, have much to 
unlearn as well as to learn, much to undo as well as to do. 
The Israelites had little comfort in Egypt, and yet they 
were not very anxious to go to the promised land. Figuratively speaking, we are all at this day in Egypt, and a 
prince worse than Pharaoh reigneth in it. Although the 
prophet " like unto Moses" offers to deliver from bondage, 
and invites us to prepare and be ready to go with him,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I this morning received your letter of the 9th inst., with 
the interesting sermon which it enclosed, and I thank you 
for them both. 
</p><p>
A proper history of the United States would have much 
to recommend it : in some respects it would be singular, or 
unlike all others ; it would develop the great plan of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, for causing this extensive part of cur world to be 
discovered, and these "uttermost parts of the earth" to be 
gradually filled with civilized and Christian people and 
nations. The means or second causes by which this great 
plan has long been and still is accomplishing, arc materials 
for history, of which the writer ought well to know the use 
and bearings, and proper places. In my opinion, the historian, in the course of the work, is never to lose sight of that 
great plan. 
</p><p>
Remarkable interpositions of Divine <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> arc fine 
subjects, but the exhibition cannot have a full effect, unless 
accompanied with a distinct view of the objects and state 
of things to which they relate ; it is by discerning how 
admirably they are accommodated and fitted to answer 
their intended purposes, that the reader is made to reflect 
and feel properly. 
</p><p>
Few anions us have time and talent for such a work. I 
am pleased with the prospect of your undertaking it ; and I 
do believe, that with a due allowance of time, that is, of several years, you would execute it well. 
</p><p>
As to aid from me, I am far more willing than able to 
assist you. I became sick last autumn, and have not had a 
well day since. Although better, I am still feeble ; and can 
neither bear much exercise, nor much employment of any 
kind : even in reading and in writing, I find it necessary to 
be abstemious. 
</p><p>
I regret the circumstances which deprived me of the 
pleasure of receiving a visit from you; for no conversations 
are more agreeable to me, than those with persons whom I 
esteem, and in which the utile and the duke arc blended. 
With the best wishes for your health and happiness, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your affectionate and obedient servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
After lingering through the summer, I found my disorder 
gradually returning in the autumn. Since the middle of 
November I have been confined to the house ; but have as 
yet suffered less this winter than I did the last. At times, 
however, I seemed to be approaching that state, in which 
" a grasshopper is a burden.'' When I took up my pen, it 
was not because it was pleasant, but because it was necessary. The late tine weather has done me good. I have 
walked on the piazza, and breathed mild fresh air. I feel 
less relaxed, and think it probable that the spring will again 
relieve me. The " carpe diem" reminds me that I should 
take this opportunity of writing to you, and to a few others 
whom I have apparently neglected. 
</p><p>
From your letter I can perceive what your feelings have 
been and are. When afflictions make us wiser and better, 
they answer their purpose ; and they do so when they produce the acquiescence and resignation you mention. A 
traveller has great reason for regret, when a faithful and 
affectionate friend and companion leaves him on the road j 
but that regret is softened by the expectation of meeting 
again at the end of the journey. To you it will readily 
occur that we are all travellers ; some in coaches, others 
on foot ; some lodge in good inns, and others where the 
night finds them. Some press forward with an eye to 
" the promised land," while many others loiter and revel 
on the way, with as little concern about where they are 
going, as the horses by which they are drawn or carried, 
•fee. &c. He did not speak much at random, who said, 
" The greatest miracle to man is man." 
</p><p>
Our political sky still continues to grow more and more 
dark and threatening. Whether the clouds will quietly 
disperse and disappear, or whether they portend a storm, 
is uncertain. The present tempestuous state of the world 
does not encourage us to expect a long season of uninterrupted fair weather. If peace has been and is in our 
power, it would be mortifying to be involved in war unnecessarily. There came forth with the French revolution a 
spirit of delusion, which, like an influenza, passed over and 
infected all Europe. Even our distant country has not 
entirely escaped. Great is the number among us, of whom 
it may be said, that, "Seeing they have not perceived, and 
hearing they have not understood." Delusions have their 
errands, and are sent for some purpose different from that 
of promoting unanimity and peace. But be these things 
as they may, it is a consoling reflection that He who rules 
all, rules wisely. 
</p><p>
I will now turn to a more pleasing topic. On conversing 
with a gentleman who visited me last summer, about the 
damage said to be often done to pear-trees by lightning, he 
observed that the damage in question proceeded, in his 
opinion, more frequently from disease than from lightning. 
That on seeing the upper branches of one of his pear-trees 
to be withering, he examined them often, and found them 
to be dying from the extremities downwards. After some 
time he took off all those branches below the mortification, 
cutting through sound healthy wood. The tree soon began 
to flourish. It put forth new and strong shoots, and has 
since been as thrifty as the others. 
</p><p>
Something a little like this happened last year in my 
garden. A frost took my watermelons when they were 
about as large as a marble. They turned black, and 
dropped off. The ends of the vines began to die, and continued to do so for some days. I then had the vines cut 
below the mortified part, and the whole well sprinkled with 
plaster. They recovered, and brought some, though not 
much fruit to perfection.. 
</p><p>
I believe that you and I derive more real satisfaction 
from attending to our vines and fruit-trees, than most conquerors do from cultivating their favourite laurels. 
</p><p>
At present I indulge the expectation of being able to bid 
a cheerful welcome to the spring, and to participate a little 
in the enjoyments of it, notwithstanding the wickedness or 
folly which may abound in high places. That you may 
share largely and for many years in these and other enjoyments, is sincerely the wish of,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On the 13th instant I received and read with great pleasure your interesting and friendly letter of the 18th July 
last. There are several topics in it on which I should like 
to converse with you: they shall be noticed in some future 
letters. As I cannot write or read much at a time without 
fatigue, I shall confine myself at present to the one on which 
you express a wish to know my sentiments. 
</p><p>
A satisfactory answer to the question of " reform," can 
only result from a judicious selection and combination of 
the reasons and circumstances which bear relation to it. 
Of many of these my information is so imperfect, as that 
it would be rash to form a decided judgment. I have not 
sufficient data whereon to calculate, whether so much good 
may reasonably be expected from such a measure, as would 
justify the risk of inconveniences, to which every important 
innovation is more or less liable. 
</p><p>
The principles of the English constitution appear to 
require that the whole number of representatives should 
be fairly apportioned among the whole number of electors. 
But I have observed nothing in it which even implies what 
is called " universal suffrage." It is not a new remark, 
that they who own the country are the most fit persons to 
participate in the government of it. This remark, with 
certain restrictions and exceptions, has force in it ; and 
applies both to the elected and the electors, though with most 
force to the former. 
</p><p>
I do not know what the proposed plan of reform precisely 
is. J{ it be only to apportion the representatives among 
the counties, or other convenient election districts, whether 
now existing, or to be instituted, according to the number 
of their respective electors ; I should consider it as being a 
just and constitutional measure, and should adopt it, unless 
some existing or impending circumstances should render it 
unseasonable. I am the more inclined to this opinion by 
the present state of your aristocracy, which is such, as not 
unnaturally to excite a jealousy that it will obtain, if it has 
not already obtained, an undue ascendency. The French 
revolution has so discredited democracy, and it has so few 
influential advocates in Europe, that I doubt its giving you 
much more trouble. On the contrary, there seems to be a danger of its depreciating too much. Without a portion 
of it there can be no free government. What that portion 
should be in England, is a question to which your constitution affords, in my opinion, the best answer. To pi -serve 
balances in times like these, isdifficult; mere palliative -pro 
hac vice expedients seldom produce durable good. They 
so frequently violate sound established principles, as rarely 
to prevent more trouble than they cause. The fluctuation 
ot human affairs occasionally imposes changes on nations 
as well as on individuals, to which they find it necessary 
and prudent to accommodate, by corresponding or by countervailing changes. These, if made considerately and in 
season, generally conduce to security and order. Whether, 
during the rage and range of democracy, your aristocracy 
received greater accessions of strength than the public 
safety and sound policy required, I do not know. There 
seems, however, to be reason to apprehend, that when 
things return to a calm and settled course, the commons 
will feel the influence of the lords out of doors, and consequently within doors, in a greater degree than the constitution allows. If so, that consideration becomes an argument 
in favour of the proposed " reform." 
</p><p>
I will add an observation which strikes me as having: 
weight. Some of the boroughs appear to have degenerated 
into a mere mean, by which opulent political leaders supply 
themselves with able and active partisans and advocates. 
These, although received in parliament as members, are in 
fact and truth the representatives of their employers, and 
not of the nation. It must be admitted that these employers have often taken into their service men of great talents, 
and in many instances, of great worth. Wise and good 
borough-holders, like wise and good kings, doubtless wish 
and endeavour to make the best appointments ; but ought 
either borough-holders or kings to appoint representatives 
for the nation ? 
With great esteem and regard, and the best wishes for 
the prosperity of yourself and family, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your letter of the 25th November. 
Although the privations you voluntarily submit to, exceed 
the " ne quid nimis" of the wise man, they evince a sound 
mind, and will, I hope, tend to preserve it long in a sound 
body. 
</p><p>
My inquiries respecting speltz were in terms too general. 
To sow wheat here is like taking a ticket in a lottery ; 
more blanks than prizes. The fly destroys more than we 
reap. A substitute, therefore, is desirable ; and if speltz, like: 
rye, escapes the ravages of that insect, it might be a good 
one. 1 did not recollect that it required a particular process 
for cleaning. As we have no mill here adapted to that 
purpose, it would be useless to introduce it. 
</p><p>
From your description of the rye sent to you from 
France, it appears far to exceed the kind we have. 1 wish 
that instead of dividing it. you had sowed the whole in your 
own ground, and distributed parcels <>t the increase. It is 
said that the quality of rye depends greatly on that of the 
soil. The prevailing opinion here is, that the rye of this 
country is all of one and the same species, and yet in some 
parts the rye bread is excellent, and in others black and 
strong. The weight and quality of the rye you mention 
lead me to suspect that it is of another species, or a distinct 
variety. I doubt there being danger of its depreciating, 
unless sown too near our own, or in particular cases of 
neglect. I know but of one kind of grain which, notwithstanding good management, depreciates here ; and that 
is oats. 
</p><p>
I am glad your second volume will soon be published. 
I expect to read it with pleasure, especially as there has 
been a hand in it which can make a " goose-quill" diffuse 
the " utile" and the " dulce" through many a page. I suppose a number will be printed for sale; if so, be so good 
as to desire the bookseller to send for me six sets. I mean 
to place a set in our town library, and to distribute others 
among certain persons in the neighbourhood, who, in my 
opinion, would make a proper use of them. 
</p><p>
Among the accounts you received from Doctor Logan, 
there are some which I did not expect, particularly those 
which respect the relative state of the manufactures and 
agriculture of England. In the present violent fluctuation 
of European affairs, it does not appear to me extraordinary 
that bullion should occasionally be scarce, and paper depreciate even in England. I suspect it to be merely occasional 
and transient, for I have heard of no adequate cause which 
could produce and continue to produce such effects. That 
nation, I am persuaded, wish to be and remain on friendly 
terms with us. I have some reason to believe that the idea 
of "dividing" is not a new one. If the micrometer is practically accurate, the inventor has done more than I should 
have expected. 
</p><p>
Civil discord, it seems, is assigning to Spanish America 
a part in the prodigious tragedy now exhibiting on the theatre of the world. We have seen and heard of strange 
things, and unless you should take your " French leave" 
before the curtain drops, you will doubtless see and hear of 
many more. I expect to take my leave more deliberately, 
but probably more early. Be that as it may, it is a comfortable reflection, that when we do, hope will be the only 
article in Pandora's box that we shall take with us. Although a little more indisposed than I lately was, I am still 
much less unwell than I was at this time last year ; so that 
at present there is some prospect of my living to see further 
proofs of the perfectibility of human nature by modern 
philosophers, and of the increased illumination of this age 
of reason.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your letter of the 14th ult., and also the 
book on Plaster of Paris, which you was so obliging as to 
send me, and for which accept my thanks. 
</p><p>
Your letter conveyed to me the first and only information I have received, that a copy of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>President Washington</a>'s 
valedictory address had been found among the papers of 
General Hamilton, and in his handwriting; and that a certain gentleman had also a copy of it in the same handwriting. 
</p><p>
This intelligence is unpleasant and unexpected. Had 
the address been one of those official papers which, in the 
course of affairs, the secretary of the proper department 
might have prepared, and the president have signed, these 
facts would have been unimportant ; but it was a personal 
act — of choice, not of official duty — and it was so connected with other obvious considerations, as that he only 
could with propriety write it. In my opinion, President 
Washington must have been sensible of this propriety, and 
therefore strong evidence would be necessary to make me 
believe that he violated it. Whether he did or did not, is a 
question which naturally directs our attention to whatever 
affords presumptive evidence respecting it ; and leads the 
mind into a long train of correspondent reflections. I will 
give you a summary of those which have occurred to me ; 
not because I think them necessary to settle the point in 
question, for the sequel will show that they arc not, but 
because the occasion invites me to take the pleasure of reviewing and bearing testimony to the merits of our departed 
friend. 
</p><p>
Is it to be presumed from these facts, that General Hamilton was the real, and the president only the reputed author 
of that address ? Although they countenance such a presumption, yet I think its foundation will be found too slight 
and shallow to resist that strong and full stream of counter 
evidence, which flows from ,the conduct and character of 
that great man. A character not blown up into transient 
splendour by the breath of adulation, but, being compos< d 
of his great and memorable deeds, stands, and will forever 
stand, a glorious monument of human excellence 
</p><p>
So prone, however, is "poor human nature" to dislike 
and depreciate the superiority of contemporaries, that 
when these facts come to be generally known (and generally known they will be) many, with affected regret and 
hesitation, will infer and hint, that Washington had less 
greatness of talent, and less greatness of mind, than his 
friends and admirers ascribed to him. Nor will the number 
of those be few, who, from personal or party inducements, 
will artfully encourage and diligently endeavour to give 
currency to such imputations. 
</p><p>
On the other hand, there are men of candour and judgment 
(and time will increase their number) who, aiming only at 
truth, will cheerfully trace and follow its footsteps, and on 
finding, gladly embrace it. Urged by this laudable motive, they will attentively examine the history of his life ; 
and in it they will meet with such numerous proofs of his 
knowledge and experience of men and things in general, 
and of our national affairs in particular, as to silence all 
doubts of his ability to conceive and express every idea in 
that address. A careful perusal of that history will convince them, that the principles of policy which it recommends as rules for the conduct of others, are precisely those 
by which he regulated his own. 
</p><p>
There have been in the world but two systems or schools 
of policy ; the one founded on the great principles of wisdom and rectitude, the other on cunning and its various 
artifices. To the first of these belonged Washington and 
all the other worthies of every country, who ascended to 
the temple of honour through the temple of virtue. The 
doctrines, maxims, and precepts of this school, have been 
explained and inculcated by the ablest writers, ancient and 
modern. In all civilized countries they are known, though 
often neglected ; and in free states have always been publicly commended and taught. They crossed the Atlantic 
with our forefathers ; and in our days particularly, have 
not only engaged the time and attention of students, but 
have been constantly and eloquently displayed by able men 
in our senates and assemblies. What reason can there be 
to suppose that Washington did not understand these subjects ? If it be asked, what these subjects comprehend or 
relate to ? the answer is this, They relate to the nature and 
duties of man — to his propensities and passions — his virtues and vices — his habits and prejudices — his real and 
relative wants and enjoyments — his capacities for social 
and national happiness — and the means by which, according to time, place, and other existing circumstances, it is, 
in a greater or less degree, to be procured, preserved, or 
increased. From a profound investigation of these subjects, enlightened by experience, result all that knowledge 
and those maxims and precepts of sound policy, which 
enable legislators and rulers to manage and govern public 
affairs wisely and justly. 
</p><p>
By what other means than the practical use of this knowledge, could Washington have been able to lead and govern 
an army, hastily collected from various parts, and who 
brought with them to the field all the license and all the 
habits which they had indulged at home ? Could he, by 
the force of orders and proclamations, have constrained 
them to render him that obedience, confidence, and warm 
attachment which he soon acquired, and which, throughout 
all vicissitudes and distresses, continued constant and undiminished to the last ? By what other means could he 
have been able to frustrate the designs of dark cabals, and 
the unceasing intrigues of envious competitors, and the arts 
of the opposing enemy ? By what other means could he 
have been able, in so masterly a manner, to meet and manage all those perplexing embarrassments which the revolutionary substitution of a new government — which the 
want of that power in Congress which they had not, and 
of that promptitude which no deliberative body can have — 
which the frequent destitution, and constant uncertainty of 
essential supplies — which the incompetency of individuals, 
on whom much depended, the perfidy of others, and the 
mismanagement of many, could not fail to engender. 
We know, and history will inform posterity, that from the 
first of his military career, he had to meet and encounter, and 
surmount a rapid succession of formidable difficulties, even 
down to the time when his country was enabled, by the 
success of their arms, to obtain the honourable peace which 
terminated the war. His high and appointed course being 
then finished, he disdained the intimations of lawless ambition to prolong it. He disbanded the army under circumstances which required no common degree of policy or virtue ; and with universal admiration and plaudits, descended 
joyfully and serenely into the shades of retirement. They 
who ascribe all this to the guidance and protection of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, do well ; but let them recollect, that <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> 
seldom interposes in human affairs, but through the agency 
of human means. 
</p><p>
"When, at a subsequent and alarming period, the nation 
found that their affairs had gone into confusion, and that 
clouds, portending danger and distress, were rising over 
them from every quarter, they instituted under his auspices 
a more efficient government ; and unanimously committed 
the administration of it to him. Would they have done 
this, without the highest confidence in his political talents 
and wisdom ? Certainly not. No novice in navigation 
was ever unanimously called upon to take the helm or 
command of a ship on the point of running aground 
anions: the breakers. This universal confidence would 
have proved a universal mistake, had it not been justified 
by the event. The unanimous opinion entertained and 
declared by a whole people in favour of any fellow-citizen, 
is rarely erroneous ; especially in times of alarm and 
calamity. 
</p><p>
To delineate the course, and enumerate the measures 
which he took to arrive at success, would be to write a 
volume. The firmness and policy with winch he overcame 
the obstacles placed in his way by the derangement of 
national affairs ; by the devices of domestic demagogues, 
and of foreign agents ; as well as by the deleterious influences of the French revolution, need not be particularized. 
Our records, and histories, and memoirs render it unnt 
sary. It is sufficient to say, and it can be said with truth, 
that his administration raised the nation out of confusion 
into order; out of degradation and distress into reputation and prosperity. It found us withering — it left us 
flourishing. 
</p><p>
Is it to he believed, that after having thus led the nation 
out of a bewildered state, and guided them for many years 
from one degree of prosperity to another, he was not qualified, on retiring, to advise them how to proceed and go on? 
And what but this is the object and the burden of his valedictory address ? He was persuaded that, as the national 
welfare had been recovered and established, so it could only 
be preserved and prolonged by a continued and steady adherence to those principles of sound policy, and impartial 
justice, which had invariably directed his administration. 
Although the knowledge of them had been spread and scattered among the people, here a little, and there a little, yet, 
being desirous to mark even the last day of his public life by 
some act of public utility, he addressed and presented them 
to his fellow-citizens, in points of light so clear and strong, 
as to make deep impression on the public mind. These 
last parental admonitions of this father of his country were 
gratefully received, and universally admired. But the experience of ages informs us, that it is less difficult to give 
good advice, than to prevail on men to follow it. 
</p><p>
Such and so obvious is the force of the preceding considerations, as to render doubts of the president's ability to 
give the advice contained in the address too absurd to have 
many serious advocates. But it would not surprise me, if 
certain classical gentlemen, associating the facts you mention with the style and fashion of the address, should intimate, that his ability to compose it substantially in his 
mind, does not prove that he was also capable of communicating his advice in a paper so well written. 
</p><p>
Let those gentlemen recollect the classical maxim which 
they learned at school : 
</p><p>
" Scribendi recte, sapere est et principium et fons." 
</p><p>
They may also be referred to another classical maxim, 
which teaches us, that they who well understand their subject, will be at no loss for words : 
</p><p>
" Verbaque provisam rem non invita sequentur." 
</p><p>
But his ability to write well need not be proved by the 
application of maxims ; it is established by facts. We are 
told to judge of a tree by its fruit ; let us, in like manner, 
judge of his pen by its performances. 
</p><p>
Few men, who had so little leisure, have written so 
much. His public letters alone are voluminous ; and public opinion has done justice to their merits ; many of them 
have been published, and they who read them will be convinced, that at the period of the address, he had not to 
learn how to write well. But it may be remarked, that 
the address is higher finished than the letters ; and so it 
ought to be. That address was to be presented to the 
whole nation, and on no common occasion : it w T as intended 
for the present and future generations ; it was to be read 
in this country, and in foreign countries ; and to be criticised, not only by affectionate friends and impartial judges, 
but also bv envious and malignant enemies. It was an 
address which, according as it should or should not correspond with his exalted character and fame, would either 
justify or impeach the prevailing opinion of his talents and 
wisdom. Who, therefore, can wonder that he should bestow more thought, and time, and pains on that address 
than on a letter ? 
</p><p>
Although in the habit of depending ultimately on his 
own judgment, yet no man was more solicitous to obtain 
and collect light on every question and measure on which 
he had to decide. He knew that authors, like parents, are 
not among the first to discover imperfections in their 
offspring; and that consideration would naturally induce 
him to imitate the example of those ancient and modern 
writers (among whom were statesmen, generals, and even 
men of consular and royal dignity) who submitted their 
compositions to the judgment of their friends, before they 
put the last hand to them. Those friends would make 
notes of whatever defects they observed in the draught, 
and of the correspondent amendments which they deemed 
proper. If they found that the arrangement could be improved, they would advise certain transpositions ; if the 
connexion between any of the relative parts was obscure, 
they would make it more apparent; if a conclusion had 
better be left to implication than expressed, they would 
strike it out, and so vice versa; if an additional remark 
or allusion would give force or light to a sentiment or 
proposition, they would propose it ; where a sentence was 
too long, they would divide it; they would correct redundances ; change words less apt, for words more apt, &c, 
&c, &c. To correct a composition in this way, is to do 
a friendly office ; but to prepare a new one, and offer it to 
the author as a substitute for his own, would deserve a different appellation. 
</p><p>
Among those to whose judgment and candour President 
Washington would commit such an interesting and delicate 
task, where is the man to be found, who would have had 
the hardihood to say to him in substance, though in terms 
ever so nice and courtly — Sir, I have examined and considered your draught of an address : it will not do ; it is 
really good for nothing. But, sir, I have taken the trouble 
to write a proper one for you ; and I now make you a 
present of it : I advise you to adopt it, and to pass it on the 
world as your own; the cheat will never be discovered, 
for you may depend on my secrecy. Sir, I have inserted 
in it a paragraph that will give the public a good opinion 
of your modesty : I will read it to you ; it is in these 
words : 
</p><p>
" In the discharge of this trust, I will only say, that I 
have, with good intentions, contributed towards the organization and administration of the government, the best exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. 
Not unconscious, in the outset, of the inferiority of my 
qualifications, experience in my own eyes, perhaps still 
more in the eyes of others, has strengthened the motives to 
diffidence of myself." 
</p><p>
If it be possible to find a man among those whom he 
esteemed, capable of offering to him such a present, it is 
impossible to believe that <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>President Washington</a> was the 
man to whom such a present would have been acceptable. 
They who knew <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>President Washington</a>, and his various 
endowments, qualifications, and virtues, know that, aggregately considered, they found a " tout ensemble" which has 
rarely been equalled, and perhaps never excelled. 
</p><p>
Thus much for presumptive evidence. I will now turn 
your attention to some that is direct. 
</p><p>
The history (if it may be so called) of the address is not 
unknown to me ; but as I came to the knowledge of it 
under implied confidence, I doubted, when I first received 
your letter, whether I ought to disclose it. On more 
mature reflection, I became convinced, that if President 
Washington was now alive, and informed of the facts in 
question, he would not only authorize, but also desire me 
to reduce it to writing ; that when necessary, it might 
be used to invalidate the imputations to which those facts 
give colour. This consideration terminated my doubts. I 
do not think that a disclosure is necessary at this moment, 
but I fear such a moment will arrive. Whether I shall 
then be alive, or in capacity to give testimony, is so uncertain, that in order to avoid the risk of either, I shall now 
reduce it to writing, and commit it to vour care and discretion, " de bene esse," as the lawyers say. 
</p><p>
Some time before the address appeared, Colonel (afterward General) Hamilton informed me, that he had received 
a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>President Washington</a>, and with it the draught 
of a farewell address, which the president had prepared. 
and on which he requested our opinion. He then proposed 
that we should fix on a day for an interview at my house 
on the subject. A day was accordingly appointed. On 
that day <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Hamilton</a> attended. He observed to me, 
in words to this effect — that, after having read and examined the draught, it appeared to him to be suscepuble of 
improvement — that he thought the easiest and best way 
was to leave the draught untouched and in its fail state; 
and to write the whole over with such amendments, alterations, and corrections as he thought were advisable; and 
that he had done so. He then proposed to read it, and to 
make it the subject of our consideration. This being agreed 
to, he read it ; and we proceeded deliberately to discuss 
and consider it, paragraph by paragraph, until the whole 
met with our mutual approbation : some amendments were 
made during the interview, but none of much importance. 
Although this business had not been hastily despatched, yet, 
aware of the consequence of such a paper, I suggested the 
giving it a further critical examination ; but he declined it, 
saying that he was pressed for time, and was anxious to 
return the draught to the president without delay. It 
afterward occurred to me, that a certain proposition was 
expressed in terms too general and unqualified, and I hinted 
it in a letter to the president. 
</p><p>
As the business took the course above mentioned, a recurrence to the draught was unnecessary, and it was not 
read. There was this advantage in the course pursued — 
the president's draught remained (as delicacy required) 
fair, and not obscured by interlineations, &c. By comparing it with the paper sent with it, he would immediately 
observe the particular emendations and corrections that 
were proposed ; and would find them standing in their intended places. Hence he was enabled to review and to 
decide on the whole matter, with much greater clearness 
and facility than if he had received them in separate and 
detached notes, and with detailed references to the pages 
and lines, where they were advised to be introduced. 
With great esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir,

Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the book on the Resources of Great 
Britain, which you was so obliging as to send me. It 
abounds in interesting matter, and if the facts and calculations stated in it are correct, there appears to be reason to 
conclude that Britain has less danger to apprehend from a 
long-continued war, than from a premature peace. 
</p><p>
In the twelfth page there is an anecdote which seems to 
refer to me : if it does, it is proper for me to observe that 
your information on that head is not entirely accurate. 
While in France I was neither present at the death, nor at 
the funeral of any French philosopher. During my residence there, I do not recollect to have had more than two 
conversations with atheists about their tenets. The first 
was this : I was at a large party, of which were several of 
that description. They spoke freely and contemptuously 
of religion. I took no part in the conversation. In the 
course of it, one of them asked me if I believed in Christ ? 
I answered that I did, and that I thanked God that I did. 
</p><p>
Nothing further passed between me and them or any of them on that subject. 
</p><p>
Some time afterward, one of my family being dangerously ill, I was advised to send for an English physician, 
who had resided many years at Paris. He was said to be 
very skilful, but, it was added, he is an atheist. I sent 
him, and had reason to think highly of his skill. For 
several weeks the patient required numerous visits, so that 
I saw the doctor often. He was a sedate, decent man. I 
frequently observed him drawing the conversation towards 
religion, and I constantly gave it another direction. He 
nevertheless, during one of his visits, very abruptly remarked, that there was no God, and he hoped the time 
would come when there would be no religion in the world. 
I very concisely remarked, that if there was no God, there 
could be no moral obligations, and 1 did not see how society 
could subsist without them. He did not hesitate to admit, 
that if there was no God, there could be no moral obligations, but insisted that they were not necessary, for that 
society would find a substitute for them in enlightened selfinterest. I soon turned the conversation to another topic, 
and he probably perceiving that his sentiments met with a 
cold reception, did not afterward resume the subject.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On the 4th inst. your letter of the 23d of last month was 
delivered to me. It gave us all pleasure to find from it 
that you and your family were then well. If all the productions of your farm are as fine as tiie sample of one 
kind of them, which you sent me, you have much reason to 
praise it. 
You have certainly had no inconsiderable share of difficulties, dangers, and troubles, and as you justly observe, 
<a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> has carried you through them all, and has also 
given you consolations and enjoyments. Such is more or 
less the lot of all men. If, my good friend, there were no 
trials in this world, it would not be what it certainly is, a 
state of probation ; some are tried by adversity, some by 
prosperity, and many by both. If in our journey through 
life, we were to meet with nothing but what was pleasant, 
we should probably be too little mindful of home, and too 
little disposed to take a rough road to it, even though it 
should be the most direct one. We have neither of us 
much further to travel. If, on our arrival, we find it a 
paradise, our enjoyments will not be diminished by the 
recollection that we had suffered much on the way. 
</p><p>
I still flatter myself with the expectation of again seeing 
you here, especially as your health is good, and your business would be attended to during your absence. We should 
have new affairs as well as old affairs to talk over. Those 
among the new ones, which concern the welfare of yourself 
and family, will be particularly interesting to

Dear. Peter, 
</p><p>
It is said that the manufacturing company at Mamaroneck have applied to the Legislature for an act to empower 
them (on paying damages) to overflow and drown as much 
of the adjacent farms, and without the consent of the owners, as may be necessary to make a pond that will afford a 
more ample supply of water than they can otherwise obtain 
there. The country abounds in plentiful streams. Why 
did they not fix on one that would answer their purpose ? 
</p><p>
When a piece of ground is wanted for a use important 
to the State, I know that the State has a right to take it 
from the owner, on paying the full value of it ; but certainly 
the Legislature has no right to compel a freeholder to part 
with his land to any of his fellow-citizens, nor to deprive 
him of the use of it, in order to accommodate one or more 
of his neighbours in the prosecution of their particular trade 
or business. Such an act. by violating the rights of property, would be a most dangerous precedent. 
</p><p>
The injury which the pond would doubtless cause to the 
health of the neighbourhood deserves attention ; but interesting as it is, I think it of less importance than that of 
exposing, by such an act, the rights of property to invasion 
and disturbance. It may be said that the pond, by facilitating manufactures, will be productive of good to the 
public ; but will it not produce more loss than gain, if any 
of the essential rights of freemen are to be sunk in it. 
</p><p>
If the company want any thing belonging to their neighbours, let them, like all other individuals, obtain it by voluntary, and not by compelled purchase. It would be strange 
if the Legislature appointed to guard our equal rights, 
should be prevailed upon to furnish means for such compulsion. 
</p><p>
These remarks are made on the supposition that what 1 
have heard may possibly be true ; but to me it appears so 
extraordinary, that I am inclined to suspect that it has not 
been fully and fairly represented. Be so good as to inform 
me, what the application made by the company to the Legislature really is. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Peter, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate uncle,

Sir, 
</p><p>
In your obliging answer to my letter of February last, 
mention is made of a work of your brother, then in the 
press, viz. " Memoirs of the War in the Southern Department." The subject and the author naturally excited my 
attention, and my desire to procure a copy. 
</p><p>
I have not learned that it has yet been published, nor 
seen any thing relative to it in our public papers. I presume, therefore, that the work is still in the press. If it is 
printing by subscription. I wish that my name may be on 
the list of subscribers, and that I may use my endeavours to 
increase the number of them. Be pleased, therefore, to 
inform me on this head. 
</p><p>
The outrages committed at <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> excited the greater 
indignation, on account of the characters of some of the sufferers, and particularly your brother, whose claims to public 
gratitude have so long and so justly been acknowledged 
throughout the United States. Let me request the favour 
of you to assure him that I rejoice in the prospect of his 
recovery ; and in the hope that on the occurrence of proper 
occasions, our country will again derive advantage and 
honour from his talents and patriotism.

Rev. Sir, 
</p><p>
I received by the last mail your letter of the 19th September, containing a copy of " An act to incorporate the 
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions," 
and an abstract from their minutes, purporting, that at a meeting of the board in September last, I had been elected a member of it. 
</p><p>
Such institutions become the religion we profess, and the 
blessings we enjoy. Be pleased to assure the board that I 
am very sensible of the honour they have done me; and 
that I wish it was as much in my power, as it is in my 
inclination, to attend their meetings and take an active part 
in the business committed to them. For several years my 
health has been declining, and my age, as well as the nature 
of my complaints, do not permit me to expect the restoration of it. 
</p><p>
Reflecting that they who consent to accept a place or 
office do impliedly engage to perform the duties of it, I 
think it right to declare my inability to perform those in 
question. If, therefore, any active services should be expected from me, I hope and request that the board will 
consider themselves at liberty to give to this declaration 
, the effect of a resignation, and proceed to elect another in 
my stead.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for your friendly letter of the 17th ult., 
and for the sermon and report which accompnnnd it. 
</p><p>
Whether our religion permits Christians to vote for infidel rulers, is a question which merits more consideration 
than it seems yet to have generally received, either from 
the clergy or the laity. It appears to me, that what the 
prophet said to Jehoshaphat about his attachment to Ahab,* 
affords a salutary lesson on another interesting topic. 
</p><p>
* " Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord V 
— 2 Chron. xix. 2. 
Although the mere expediency of public measures may 
not be a proper subject for the pulpit, yet, in my opinion, it 
is the right and the duty of our pastors to press the ob 
servance of all moral and religious duties, and to animadvert on every course of conduct which may be repugnant 
to them. 
</p><p>
The Rev. Mr. Chapin informed me, that the American 
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions had done me 
the honour to elect me one of the members of it, and has 
also been so obliging as to send me copies of their last 
report. Institutions like this are not only to be approved 
and commended, but also to be sustained and assisted. As 
the declining state of my health will not permit me to render any active service, I feared that by retaining a place at 
the board, I should exclude some other person who would 
be more useful. My answer, therefore, to Mr. Chapin 
referred it to the board to do therein as they may judge 
proper. 
</p><p>
The amount of the subscriptions exceed what I had supposed, and manifests a spirit which I hope will become more 
universal. 
</p><p>
Permit me to request the favour of you to procure for 
me two complete sets of the Panoplist,* and to put my 
name on the list of subscribers for two of each of the future 
numbers. I purpose to place one set of them in our town 
library : some good may result from it. 
</p><p>
Such is your knowledge and information relative to the 
United States and their affairs, that I regret your finding 
it inconvenient to undertake the history you allude to. 
That it will be written at some future day is probable ; but 
when, or how well performed, is uncertain. Time will not 
wait, but will proceed in its usual way to impair memory, 
to diminish and obscure evidence, to introduce doubt, and 
enable error to impose on credulity, and acquire credit from

currency. I presume, therefore, that a history (except as 
to great outlines) is the less to be depended upon, as its date 
is remote from the period of the transactions which it undertakes to narrate. How few have the talents, the patient 
diligence, and the love of truth which history requires. 
</p><p>
The aspect of the times certainly continues portentous. 
To hope for the best and prepare for the worst, is a trite 
but a good maxim ; especially when associated with the 
reflection that He who governs the world can restrain the 
wrath of man as well as the rage of the ocean. It is a 
favourable circumstance, that the delusion which, like an 
epidemic, has prevailed throughout our country, is abating 
in many of the States. Calamities sometimes afford good 
remedies for national distempers. 
</p><p>
My retirement has not disappointed me. As to my 
health, a complaint in the liver has for several years been 
impairing it. Medical prescriptions failing to remove it, 
relief could only be sought from palliatives; and among 
these I find temperance, patience, and resignation to be the 
best. 
</p><p>
I am glad, for her sake and for yours, that Mrs. Morse 
enjoys good health. I hope you do also. That you may 
both live to see many happy returns of this day, is very sincerely the wish of

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your obliging letter of the 30th ult. The

handsomely expressed.

The copies of the report, which you had the goodness to 
send, have come to hand.

Many considerations would make it agreeable to me to 
attend the meeting of the board at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. I have heretofore found and enjoyed excellent society in that city, and 
although I should feel the absence of several worthy persons, who have removed to the " city not made with hands,"

Notwithstanding the inducements I have to make frequent 
visits to New-York, I have not been there for four years 
past. The state of my health, and the regimen it requires, 
not permitting me to be far or long from home. 
</p><p>
It is certainly desirable that those of our fellow-citizens 
who are friendly to foreign missions, should contribute to 
repair the loss of the mission printing-office at Serampore. 
It appears from a late paper that measures for that purpose 
were taking at New- York, and there is reason to hope 
and expect, that the aggregate amount of the collections 
will be considerable. 
</p><p>
The mode of remitting it to India is of some importance. 
To me it appears advisable that all American missionary 
measures should, as far as circumstances may admit, be 
connected with the American Board for Foreign Missions. 
I therefore think, that the money in question should be 
remitted to India accordingly. If we were at peace with 
England, I should prefer having it remitted, by the board, 
to the missionary society there, and through them to India. 
Mutual confidence and good-will between societies instituted 
for the same purpose, and actuated by similar motives of 
benevolence, should be cultivated.

Having for some days past been less well than usual, I 
find myself constrained to be more concise than I intended 
when I began this letter.

My good Friend, 
</p><p>
I thank you for informing me by your letter of the 15th 
inst. that you had received " an heritage and gift," which 
doubtless filled your heart with joy and gratitude. 
</p><p>
It would give me pleasure to present in person to you 
and Mrs. Morris my gratulations on the occasion ; but since 
the winter began, I have not been abroad, and this confinement will, as usual, continue until warm weather. I hope 
Mrs. Morris and the " spes altera" are doing well, and that 
the emotions they excite are not interrupted by gout or 
anxiety. 
</p><p>
You request me to be one of the godfathers. Baptism 
is too generally regarded as being little more than a customary ceremony ; and yet the purpose of it, and the names 
used on the occasion, show it to be a solemn procedure. 
It confers privileges, and imposes obligations of the highest class. Whoever consents to be employed as a shepherd, 
should recollect, that if a lamb be lost by his negligence, he 
must answer for it to the owner of the flock. Sponsors, 
however, not unfrequently become such, with as little sense 
of personal responsibility, as actors on the stage make the 
engagements, &c, allotted to their parts. 
</p><p>
Had I the prospect of residing here many years, I should 
feel no reluctance, for I should find in my heart and mind 
sufficient inducements to fulfil the duties in question, in case 
they should eventually be incumbent on me. But as I expect to remove, at a more early period, to a distant country, 
where I shall not be in a capacity to attend to persons or 
things here, it appears to me advisable that some proper 
person not so circumstanced should be selected. 
</p><p>
It is an agreeable circumstance that you will probably, 
continue at Morrisania for many years, and have time and 
health to prepare the young gentleman to make a figure 
there, as w T ell as at the more valuable habitation and 
estate, which will, in his baptism, be offered to him by his 
Sovereign. 
</p><p>
That you and he may, here and ever, be happy in and 
with each other, is the fervent wish of

Rev. Sir, 
</p><p>
I received on Saturday last the interesting letter which 
you did me the favour to write on the 31st ult, together 
with the two pamphlets which you was so obliging as to 
send with it. 
</p><p>
Marks of respect to the characters of such men as Dr. 
Elliot, not only tend to console their afflicted relatives, but 
also to cherish the virtues by which they were distinguished. 
"Unhappily, there is too much reason for the common 
remark, that obituary commendations by anonymous writers 
are so frequently misapplied as to be worth very little. 
The sermon (as was proper) describes the Dr.'s character 
in general terms, but the testimony which it bears to his 
merit is ample, clear, and decided ; and considering from 
whom it comes, leaves no room for doubt or scruple 
</p><p>
As the intruded memoir, to contain a more detailed account of Dr. Elliot, is to be published in the next volume of 
Historical Collections, and consequently under the auspices 
of the society, it will be appreciated by that circumstance, 
and doubtless have also the advantage of being written in 
a manner worthy of the subject, and of such respectable 
patrons. This will be bestowing merited praise in a handsome manner. Not a few of the name, and I presume of 
the same family, of Elliot, have in this country laboured 
faithfully in promoting the best interests of man. Their 
services will be remembered in heaven, and ought not to 
be forgotten on earth. I feel for the Dr.'s family. Death 
daily severs many tender ties . . . but not for ever. 
</p><p>
I thank you very sincerely for your kind offers of service, and with pleasure reciprocate them. They prompt 
me to request the favour of you to send me the 1st volume 
of the new series, as well as the 10th volume, mentioned in 
my letter to Dr. Elliot. 
</p><p>

Sir, 
</p><p>
I received by the last mail your letter of the 19th inst. 
The circumstances mentioned in it cannot be regarded 
with indifference by those who wish you well ; and I feel as 
well as think so. 
It is not improbable, that doubts prevail respecting the 
design and tendency of the work you have in hand. The 
literary productions of Britain and America being interesting to each other, many are of opinion, and I concur in it, 
that the English language and its orthography should be 
the same in both countries. Apprehensions have been entertained that your dictionary would tend to impair that 
sameness ; and those apprehensions may, to a certain degree, have had an unfavourable influence. 
</p><p>
The progress of the subscription having been so long 
suspended, I think it better to enclose what I intended to 
subscribe, than trouble your agents at New-York with it. 
</p><p>
If any plan to render your prospects more promising, 
and in my power to promote, should be adopted, be pleased 
to communicate it to me. 
</p><p>
I am, sir,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have chosen for this letter a subject that is more within 
your province than in mine. " Quisque sua arte peritus." 
</p><p>
The 29th verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st Corinthians 
is deemed to be an obscure one. I understand it in a sense 
which satisfies me, but I find that the few commentators 
whom I have consulted, understand it in other senses. I 
will subjoin the verse, and explain what I conceive to be 
the meaning of it, in a short paraphrase. Tell me what 
you think of it. When you see Mr. Evarts, be pleased to 
present my best compliments to him. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your faithful and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>. 
1 Cor. xv. 29. — " Else what shall they do who have been 
baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all 1 why are 
they then baptized for the dead ?" 
</p><p>
The apostle doubtless intended to include in this verse, 
an argument to support the doctrine he was endeavouring 
to establish. That sense of it, therefore, is probably the 
true one, which gives the most strength and fitness to the 
argument. 
</p><p>
His meaning will perhaps be more perceptible, if certain 
parts of the verse be transposed, as follows : 
</p><p>
Else what shall they do, who, if the dead rise not at all, 
have been baptized for the dead. Why are they then baptized for the dead 1 
</p><p>
As thus read, the converse of the proposition is plainly 
this, viz. That they are not baptized for the dead, if the 
dead are to rise : but that they are baptized for the dead, 
if the dead are not to rise. 
</p><p>
So that the question, whether they are baptized for the 
dead or not, depends on the answer to the question, whether 
the dead are to rise or not. 
</p><p>
PARAPHRASE. 
</p><p>
But Christ is risen, and he will certainly raise our dead 
bodies from the grave. If it were not so, what are believers, 
who, in a confident hope and expectation, and as an assurance 
of a resurrection, have been baptized, and thereby become 
professed disciples and followers of Christ, to do ? 
</p><p>
Baptism initiated them into his covenant and promise to 
revive and reunite their bodies with their souls after death, 
and bless them with everlasting life and happiness in & future 
state. If there is to be no such revival, no such reunion, 
no such future state, their baptism, and faith, and hopes in 
the gospel are vain and nugatory. What are they to do ? 
What can they do ? 
</p><p>
They who were baptized into Christ were baptized into 
his death ; they were buried with him by baptism into death ; 
they were planted together into the likeness of his death. 
And why ? Certainly for assurance that they should also 
be planted into the likeness of his resurrection. Divest 
baptism of its reference to a resurrection, and it will have 
no other remaining reference but the one to death and the 
dead. 
</p><p>
//"the dead rise not at all (as some among you say), then, 
and in that case, and on that supposition, all without exception who have been baptized, are in fact baptized for the 
dead, that is, for their own dead bodies, for their dust and 
ashes; for that is the only future state in which they will 
be and remain for ever. Why, or for what reason, or for 
what purpose then, or in that case, arc they baptized for 
their dead bodies — dead and never to rise again ? What 
effect can baptism, or promises, or covenants operate on, or 
for them, after they have passed into a state of utter and 
never-ending insensibility ? Is it for such a future state, 
that our bodies are baptized with water, and our souls with 
the Holy Ghost ? 
</p><p>
You know that I preach and declare to the Jews, and to 
the gentiles, that Christ is risen, and that he will raise the 
dead. Unless I was sincere in this, would I persist in 
preaching it at the risk of my life every hour ? 
</p><p>
If the dead are never to rise, what advantage or reward 
can I expect or receive, for the persecutions and sufferings 
which I willingly incur and endure, on account of my 
avowed and zealous adherence to Christ ? Did I believe 
that this was the only world in which I am to exist, would 
I not endeavour to find and enjoy all the good and all the 
gratifications which this world affords I It is natural for 
those who neither expect good nor evil beyond the grave, 
to say, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die." 
Nothing can be more manifest than that, if in this world 
only we have hope in Christ, we, his persecuted apostles 
and followers, are of all men most miserable. 
</p><p>
Be not deceived into doubts of a resurrection. You 
were not baptized for eternal sleep, but for endless life after 
death, and your baptism is a pledge to assure you of it. If 
you reject one of the assurances, or declarations, or promises 
of Christ as fallacious, how are you to rely on the rest ? 
Listen not to such teachers, lest their evil examples and 
communications seduce you into opinions and practices 
repugnant to the principles, institutions, and manners which 
are established and enjoined by the gospel.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since my last letter to you, I have received yours of the 
10th of last month. 
</p><p>
The information that you and your family were then in 
good health; gives us pleasure. I continue feeble, but do 
not suffer much pain, except now and then from rheumatism. The rest of us are as well as usual. 
</p><p>
The cold weather you mention has also prevailed here. 
I do not recollect so cool a summer. Our corn does not 
look well. The crops of rye were slender ; those of wheat 
were good. 
</p><p>
As to public affairs, I do not wonder that you look forward to the consequences of the war with anxiety. We 
are told that " wherewithal a man sinneth, by the same also 
shall he be punished," and this doubtless is applicable to 
nations as well as to individuals. He who governs all 
nations, sometimes corrects national misrule by making it 
instrumental to national chastisement ; we have been ungrateful. 
</p><p>
You and I are far advanced in our journey through life. 
We have in the course of it sometimes found the weather, 
the roads, and the accommodations agreeable ; at other 
times we have found them unpleasant, and occasionally 
distressing ; and so, my good friend, it will be to the end. 
Let us comfort ourselves with the reflection, that although 
we must expect to meet with troubles of one kind or other 
on the way, yet that they cannot prevent our getting home. 
On the contrary, they tend to excite our diligence and to 
quicken our pace. That we may both be enabled to keep 
in the right road to our home, is the wish and prayer of,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for your letter of the 22d ult., and for 
the papers which you was so good as to send; they 
arrived by the last mail. 
</p><p>
It is to be regretted, that passions unfavourable to mutual 
good-will have for years been industriously and unwisely 
excited both in Great Britain and America. An inveterate 
delusion has long prevailed in our country ; <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> 
has made it a scourge for our chastisement, and we well 
deserve it. 
</p><p>
Every independent nation has, as such, a rightful and 
exclusive jurisdiction over the country within its acknowledged boundary lines. For either nation to propose to the 
other a system of measures for the security and comfort of 
the Indians, dwelling within their contiguous and respective 
territories, or for other mutual good purposes, can neither 
be offensive nor improper ; but to dictate such propositions, 
and to tell us that we must accede to them as the price of 
peace/Ms to assume language rarely used, unless by the 
victorious to the vanquished. 
</p><p>
It is not clear to me, that Britain did then expect or 
desire to conclude the war quite so soon. As to her present or future disposition to peace, or how far it has been or 
may be affected by a settled or by a still fluctuating state 
of things in Europe, or by calculations of our becoming 
more united or more divided, cannot now be known. If 
we should change our rulers, and fill their places with men 
free from blame, the restoration of peace might doubtless 
be more easily accomplished. Such a change will come, 
but not while the prevailing popular delusion continues to 
deceive and mislead so great a portion of our citizens. 
</p><p>
Things being as they are, I think we cannot be too perfectly united in a determination to defend our country ; 
nor be too vigilant in watching and resolutely examining 
the conduct of the administration in all its departments, 
candidly and openly giving decided approbation or decided 
censure, according as it may deserve the one or the other. 
Report says, that in the public expenditures there has been 
great culpability. It is desirable, therefore, that they be 
thoroughly investigated, and that the results be authenticated in such a manner as to obviate doubt and disbelief. 
</p><p>
I have just read <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='colleague met'>Mr. King</a>'s speech. They who complain that it exhibits too little of the " suaviter in modo" 
cannot also complain that it exhibits too little of the " fortiter in re."

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It is a great while since any letters have passed between 
us ; perhaps some of them have miscarried. The season 
reminds me that I have survived the last year, and that I 
have left with it a great number who enjoyed more health 
and strength. Many friendly wishes have, as usual, been 
reciprocated on this occasion, but it seems to be questionable whether an average proportion of them will be realized. Public adversity, you know, is at variance with 
individual happiness ; and it has not yet become very 
probable that this will be a happy year to our country. I 
should rejoice to find myself mistaken, but I cannot be persuaded that general prosperity will be restored while our nation continues to be misled by the delusions which 
caused, and which prolong our calamities. We have not 
only declared war unwisely, but have also unwisely 
(though not unwittingly) excited disgust and resentment. 
How far angry passions will retard the return of peace 
may be conjectured, rather than calculated. We are yet 
to learn whether the result of the negotiations at Vienna 
will impede or promote those at Ghent. While the former 
are pending, I suspect that Britain will not be anxious to 
obviate delays. To me, personally, these things cannot 
long be very interesting, but I feel for those whom I shall 
leave behind me. You are in the way of knowing more 
about our national affairs than I am, and I sincerely wish 
that your views of them may be more consoling than mine 
are. 
</p><p>
My health continues to wear away, but I seldom suffer 
severe pain. Conversation, books, and recollections still 
enable me, with the blessing of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, to amuse confinement, and to glide on placidly towards that ocean to 
which the stream of time is bearing us all. 
</p><p>
Tell me how you do. With constant esteem and regard,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On reading your interesting letter of the 19th January, 
I observed, with particular pleasure, from the manner and 
matter of it, that, notwithstanding the winter of life, and 
snow falling on your head, you endure like an evergreen. 
</p><p>
Your impression that " we should, ere long, have peace" 
has been verified. If I remember right, you had heretofore an impression that Spain, although her case was apparently desperate, would get safe through her danger ; 
and so it came to pass. Events having justified both these 
impressions or opinions, I wish you may have another, viz. 
that the peace will terminate the delusion which caused the 
war. Several considerations incline me to expect that the 
peace will diminish it, and particularly these : 
</p><p>
Unless discontents should arise between France and 
Britain, French influence will not soon be very active in 
America ; and, consequently, will not administer much fuel 
to renew and feed a flame against England. The peace 
will deprive the delusion of the sustenance it derived from 
the patronage which the war create I. 
</p><p>
The abandonment of the professed objects of the war, 
and that without compensation either in fact or expectation — the manifest incapacity and profusion with which the 
war has been conducted — the attempts to force supplies of 
men and money by conscription, &c. — and the immense 
debt incurred and to be paid, without any value received — 
all tend to withdraw confidence and good-will from our 
political projectors ; nor can the continuance and operation 
of war-taxes be congenial with the feelings of a people who, 
if pagans, would dedicate more temples to Plutus than to 
Minerva. 
</p><p>
These, and the like facts and considerations, will doubtless have the most weight with that portion of the community who have been misled, but who really mean well. 
They will probably have some effect also on the more considerate of the others. As to the position, that " the people 
always mean well," or, in other words, that they always 
mean to say and to do what they believe to be right and 
just, — it may be popular, but it cannot be true. The word 
])coj)lc, you know, applies to all the individual inhabitants 
of a country, collectively considered. That portion of 
them who individually mean well, never was, nor until the 
millennium will be, considerable. We have not heard of 
any country, in which the great mass of the inhabitants 
individually and habitually adhere to the dictates of 
their consciences. We know how well demagogues and 
pharisaical patriots mean. Having much of the wisdom of 
this world, and little of that of the other, they will, like 
their great predecessor Absalom, always mean and act 
accordingly. 
</p><p>
Besides, <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> sometimes chastises nations with 
physical epidemics, and sometimes (by " choosing their 
delusions") with moral epidemics, and after a while removes 
them. This encourages hope ; for if we have arrived at 
or near the pessimum of this evil, the melius cannot be far 
distant. 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the book you was so kind as to 
send me. I have found some good things in it, and shall 
doubtless find more. Many of our citizens, who are more 
than mere farmers, have of late years improved our agriculture. Would not a good American edition of Columella 
be acceptable to them ? It gratifies curiosity, by showing 
the state of agriculture at a remote period ; and, on several 
topics, affords information which will be useful at any period 
</p><p>
I am glad you escaped and recovered so well from the 
accident you mention. Kentucky racers, both literal and 
figurative, will, it seems, have their capers. It would be 
no loss to the public, if some of them were at the plou^li 
Seek for " some honest, sober beast, that full softly treads," 
and will not mar your meditations. 
Adieu, my dear sir. 
</p><p>
Yours, affectionately,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On the 4th inst. I received by the mail from New-York 
your interesting letter of the 17th ult. I have read the 
pamphlets communicated to me by Mr. Grant, and derived 
from them the only knowledge I have of the transactions 
noticed in them. It would not be easy to introduce into 
my mind doubts of your rectitude. My opinion of it has 
undergone no alterations. You are drawing consolation 
from a source which always affords it. 
</p><p>
As to the work you mention, I am glad you have undertaken it, because it is desirable, and because I expect it will 
be well performed. It would give me pleasure to afford 
the aids you request, but the state of my health admits of 
very little exertion of mind or body. I can neither read 
nor write much at a time, without bringing on a feverish 
weariness. 
</p><p>
My public life did not commence so early as you supposed. In <a href='/results.php?year=1766'>1766</a>, 1 was a clerk in a lawyer's office, and on 
leaving it was occupied in professional affairs until the year 
<a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a>, when I was sent to the first Congress. In <a href='/results.php?year=1775'>1775</a>, I 
was also in Congress ; in <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>, the Convention of this State 
detained me with them. In <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a> I was again sent to Congress, and remained there until September, <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>, when I 
was sent to Europe. In <a href='/results.php?year=1784'>1784</a> I returned home. 
</p><p>
From this statement, you will perceive that my knowledge of the important events which occurred before the 
year <a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a> cannot be particular. 
</p><p>
The difficulty of collecting materials, and of ascertaining 
their real value, will increase with time. There are very 
few of the well-informed official men of those days now 
alive, and the few who remain will in a few years more be 
gone. To you I need not remark that many things have 
been written and said which are not correct. The collection of materials (if nothing to perfect it be left undone), 
will cost much time, trouble and expense. Some information may be acquired by letters, but much more and much 
better may be obtained by personal inspections, applications, 
and interviews. 
</p><p>
Valuable materials exist in the office of the secretary of 
state, in the public and private journals of Congress, and 
among the papers of the several States, &c. 
</p><p>
You know my sentiments respecting history, — festina lente. No good history has been, nor can be produced in haste. 
</p><p>
I regret the impediments which deprived me of the pleasure of the visit you intended. I hope some favourable opportunity of making it will yet occur, and that Mrs. Morse 
may come with you. We will then converse on these 
topics, and I will readily communicate to you such materials among those I possess, as you may deem interesting. 
</p><p>
Be so obliging as to assure Mr. and Mrs. Evarts of my 
best wishes for the health and prosperity of themselves and 
their family. I am glad thqj| little boy is doing well. May 
he long continue to do so in every respect.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received the papers which you were so obliging as 
to send me. Accept my thanks for them. Gratitude is 
due to those who employ their time and talents in promoting 
the common welfare. Your exertions to improve agriculture, and render it more productive, are known and acknowledged. The paper on " mildew in wheat," I have 
sent to New-York to be published. The multitude of 
interesting facts which have been collected during the last 
twenty years, doubtless furnish materials for a comprehensive system of husbandry ; such a work, ably executed, 
would be useful. 
</p><p>
Credit is also due to your endeavours to make known 
and excite attention to the means which conduce to health 
and longevity. The proposed edition of the code on these 
subjects, in one octavo volume, will be better calculated for 
general use and extensive circulation, than the larger work 
from which it is to be extracted. I hope it will soon be 
finished and find its way to this country. It must be an 
agreeable reflection to you, that you have been "diligent in 
well-doing." 
</p><p>
My health has for years been declining, and my age 
reminds me that the re-establishment of it is not to be expected. What you have written of the flesh-brush will 
induce me to use it more frequently. It can do no harm 
and may do good, and that is no inconsiderable recommendation. 
</p><p>
With the best wishes that your health and longevity 
may be such as to give additional weight to your remarks

Accept, my good friend, my thanks for your kind letter 
of the 22d ult., and for the pamphlets enclosed with it. 
They came to my hands on the 2d inst. The state of my 
health is such, that I can read or write but little at a time 
without fatigue ; and, therefore, I cannot prudently venture 
on the task you recommend. 
</p><p>
Whether war of every description is prohibited by the 
gospel, is one of those questions on which the excitement of 
any of the passions can produce no light. An answer to it 
can result only from careful investigation and fair reasoning. 
</p><p>
It appears to me that the gospel not only recognises the 
whole moral law, and extends and perfects our knowledge 
of it, but also enjoins on all mankind the observance of it. 
Being ordained by a legislator of infinite wisdom and rectitude, and in whom there is "no variableness," it must be 
free from imperfection, and therefore never has, nor ever 
will require amendment or alteration. Hence I conclude, 
that the moral law is exactly the same now that it w 7 as before the flood. 
</p><p>
That all those wars and fightings are unlawful, which 
proceed from culpable desires and designs (or in Scripture 
language from lusts), on the one side or on the other, is too 
clear to require proof. As to wars of an opposite description, and many such there have been, I believe they are as 
lawful to the unoffending party in our days, as they were 
in the days of Abraham. He waged war against and 
defeated the five kings. He piously dedica ted a tenth of the 
spoils ; and, instead of being blamed, was blessed. 
</p><p>
What should we think of a human legislator who should 
authorize or encourage infractions of his own laws? If 
wars of every kind and description are prohibited by the 
moral law, I see no way of reconciling such a prohibition with those parts of Scripture which record institutions, declarations, and interpositions of the Almighty which 
manifestly evince the contrary ? If every war is sinful, how 
did it happen that the sin of waging any war is not specified 
among the numerous sins and offences which are mentioned 
and reproved in both the Testaments? 
</p><p>
To collect and arrange the many facts and arguments 
which relate to this subject, would require more time and 
application than I am able to bestow. The aforegoing are 
hinted merely to exhibit some of the reasons on which my 
opinion rests. 
</p><p>
It certainly is very desirable that a pacific disposition 
should prevail among all nations. The most effectual way 
of producing it, is by extending the prevalence and influence 
of the gospel. Real Christians will abstain from violating 
the rights of others, and therefore will not provoke war. 
</p><p>
Almost all nations have peace or war at the will and 
pleasure of rulers whom they do not elect, and who are not 
always wise or virtuous. <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> has given to our 
people the choice of their rulers, and it is the duty, as well 
as the privilege and interest, of our Christian nation to select 
and prefer Christians for their rulers. 
</p><p>
The sentiment expressed in the extract from your 
brothers letter, corresponds with his benevolent disposition. 
He has been " diligent in well-doing," and his works will 
not cease to receive, as well as deserve commendation. 
When you write to him, assure him of my esteem and 
regard. 
</p><p>
I thank you for the kind wishes expressed in the conclusion of your letter. They refer to topics on which I have 
been accustomed to meditate, and are far more important 
than any which belong to this transient scene. 
</p><p>
With the best wishes for your welfare, in the most 
enlarged sense, 
</p><p>
I remain, your obliged friend,

Dear Morris, 
</p><p>
Having heard much of your discourse before the New-York Historical Society, it gave me pleasure to r< ■• 
copy of it, and to find from the direction that I owed it to 
your friendly attention. Itaboundsin interesting remarks ; 
the diction is elevated throughout, perhaps in some instances beyond the proportion which the topics bear to each 
other. In landscape, we prefer bill and dale to a plain, 
however ornamented : and in a field of eloquence it is agreeable to behold sublimities slopii 'j down into Attic simplicity. I doubt the correctness of saying that Franklin 
averted thunderbolts from protect d dwellings. In my opinion, the invention of steamboats is a subject on which it is 
less difficult to say handsome, than sublime things. To 
me it does not appear probable, that the sight of them on 
Asiatic waters can so powerfully affect the feelings of the 
Genius of Asia, as to impel him to bow with grateful 
reverence (not gratulation) to the inventive spirit of America ; and that, too, at the very moment when his eve, fflancine 
over the ruins of cities, which for ages had concurred in 
proclaiming his superiority in the arts, must remind him of 
his dignity. I make no apology tor these hints ; you know 
what prompts them. 
</p><p>
Your strictures on the defects of history, and the causes 
of them, are well founded. Whether future historians, with 
all their advantages, will excel their predecessors in accuracy, and caution, and candour, is ;i point on which my expectations are not sanguine. For my port, 1 believe there 
neither is, nor will be, more than one history free from error. 
Of that history the discourse has availed itself very ingeniously, deducing from it lessons instructive to all, and 
new to many. I have often wished that the accounts given 
in it of the primitive ages had been more particular. We 
know but little about them, and our curiosity must remain 
ungratified while we remain here. I say here, because when 
we join our ancestors, we shall doubtless learn from them 
all that we may wish to know respecting the affairs and 
events of their days. In this and other respects I promise 
myself much satisfaction from their society ; and that at 
a period which cannot be very distant. The term of my 
lease has expired, and I have no reason to expect that my 
continuing to hold over will be of more than ordinary duration. It is consoling to reflect that we tenants are informed 
where and how we may go and settle in perpetuity, and are 
assured that our possessions and enjoyments there, instead 
of being precarious and transitory, will be certain and permanent. 
</p><p>
That you and I, and those who are near and dear to us, 
may be enabled to say with the poet, but in a higher and 
better sense, "omnes metus, strepitumque Acherontis avari 
subjecit pedibus," is the fervent wish of your affectionate 
friend, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>. 
</p><p>
I hope our little boy advances in strength, and growth of body and mind.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I received your letter of the 9th by the mail which 
arrived here on the 24th inst. 
</p><p>
1 have not seen Mr. Wirt's book, nor heard of the " passage" in it, of which your letter contains a copy. You 
think that passage, as you understand it, is not correct, and 
observe, that as I am the only man remaining alive who 
can perfectly correct it, " in your opinion it is my conscientious duty to do it." 
</p><p>
For your satisfaction, and pursuant to your opinion, I 
will proceed to give you a plain statement of facts. There 
are entries in the printed journals of Congress of <a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a> which 
merit attention ; and I think the extracts from that journal, 
which I shall introduce, afford in erences which militate 
against some of the incidents mentioned in the passage. 
That you may compare and examine both with the greater 
ease to yourself, I will first insert the passage, and then the 
extracts. 
</p><p>
"A petition to the king, an address to the people of Great 
Britain, and a memorial to the people of British America 
were agreed to be drawn. Mr. Lee, <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='colleague'>Mr. Henry</a>, and 
others were appointed for the first ; Mr. Lee, Mr. Livingston, and <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel=''>Mr. Jay</a> for the two last. The splendour of their 
debut occasioned <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='colleague'>Mr. Henry</a> to be designated by his committee to draw the petition to the king with which they 
were charged, and Mr. Lee was charged with the address 
to the people of England. The last was firs' reported. 
On reading it, great disappointment \\ as expressed on every 
countenance, and a dead silence ensued for some minutes. 
At length it was laid on the table for perusal and consideration till the next clay ; when first one member, and then 
another arose, and, paying some faint compliment to the 
composition, observed that there were still certain considerations not expressed which should properly find a place in 
it. His address was therefore committed for amendment ; 
and one prepared by <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel=''>Mr. Jay</a>, and oiVered by Governor Livingston, was reported and adopted with scarcely an 
alteration. These facts are stated by a gentleman, to whom 
they were communicated by <a href='/results.php?tla=edp' rel='colleague'>Mr. Pendleton</a> and Mr. Harrison of the Virginia delegation (except that Mr. Harrison 
erroneously ascribed the draught to Governor Livingston), 
and to whom they were afterward confirmed by Governor Livingston himself. <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='colleague'>Mr. Henry</a>'s draft of a petition to the 
king was equally unsuccessful, and was recommitted for 
amendment. Mr. John Dickinson (the author of the farmer's Letters) was added to the committee, ami a new 
draught prepared by him was adopted." 
</p><p>
"Tuesday, October lltk, <a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a>. — Resolved unanimously; 
</p><p>
That a memorial be prepared to the people of British 
America, stating to them the necessity of a firm, united, and 
</p><p>
invariable observation of the measures recommended by 
the Congress, as they tender the invaluable rights and liberties derived to them from the laws and constitution of 
their country. 
</p><p>
" Also, that an address be prepared to the people of 
Great Britain. 
</p><p>
" Ordered, That Mr. Lee, Mr. Livingston, and <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel=''>Mr. Jay</a> 
be a committee to prepare a draught of the memorial and 
address." 
</p><p>
The committee assigned the memorial, which was first 
in order, and also deemed first in importance, to Mr. Lee. 
Mr. Livingston, who was my superior both in age and 
reputation, was desired to prepare the address. He declined it, and urged me to take it. I finally consented, and 
did write it. 
</p><p>
" Tuesday, October l&th, <a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a>. — The committee appointed 
to prepare the address to the people of Great Britain brought 
in a draught, which was read and ordered to lie on the table 
for the perusal of the members, and to be taken into consideration tomorrow. 
</p><p>
" Wednesday, October 19th, <a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a>. — The Congress resumed the consideration of the address to the people of 
Great Britain ; and the same being debated by paragraphs, 
and sundry amendments made, the same was recommitted, 
in order that the amendments may be taken in." 
</p><p>
I was present in Congress, and attended to the proposed 
amendments. Mr. Lee (one of the committee) moved that 
the draught should be recommitted for the purpose mentioned in the journal ; and for that purpose it was recommitted. The amendments were made the next day, and 
the draught was returned to Congress the ensuing morning. 
</p><p>
" Friday, October 21st, <a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a>. — The address to the people of Great Britain being brought in, and the amendments 
directed being made, the same was approved, and is as follows." 
</p><p>
Is it probable that the committee found il sary to assign both the memorial and the address to Mr. Lee, or 
that he would readily undertake that double task, or that 
notwithstanding his other avocations in and out of Congress, he could finish them both between the 11th October, 
when they were ordered, and the 19th, when the drai of the memorial was reported ? 
</p><p>
According to the journal, the draught of the address was 
recommitted, expressly for the purpose, and "in order that 
the amendments might be taken in." Is it probable that the 
committee did, nevertheless, lay aside that draught and 
substitute a new one ? How could they have rendered such 
a procedure reconcilable to the feelings of the writer of that 
draught, or compatible with their recent approbation of it, 
or consistent with the design and object of the recommitment ? Could any of the members have been so negligent 
of delicacy and propriety, as to propose or concur in such 
a measure ? Could the embarrassments and difficulties 
attending it have been surmounted between the Wednesday, when the address was recommitted, and the ensuing 
Friday, when (with the amendments taken in) it was read 
and approved ? 
</p><p>
The subsequent occurrences you mention have not 
escaped my recollection. I was informed, and I believe 
correctly, that one person in particular of those you specify, 
had endeavoured, by oblique intimations, to insinuate a suspicion that the address to the people of Great Britain was 
not written by me, but by Cov. Livingston. That gentleman repelled the insinuation. He knew and felt what was 
due to truth, and explicitly declared it. 
</p><p>
Those persons are dead and gone. Their design did not 
succeed, and I have no desire that the memory of it should 
survive them. As to the address or petition to the king — 
who wrote the draught that was reported and recommitted 
— how far it corresponded with the one that was adopted — 
whether Mr. Dickinson, after he was added to the committee, prepared an entire new draught, or only co-operated 
in amending the one then before the committee — are questions which you only, who have survived all the other 
members of that committee, can answer with certainty. 
</p><p>
Considering who were the members of that committee, 
viz. yourself, Mr. Lee, Mr. Johnson, <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='colleague'>Mr. Henry</a>, and Mr. Rutlcdge, I think the idea of a new draught cannot be correct. That*Mr. Dickinson did write the subsequent or 
second address or petition to the king, I have no reason to 
doubt. 
</p><p>
To prepare an acceptable draught of the first petition 
was no easy task. Instructions as to matters to be inserted 
in it were given to the committee : and some were proposed which occasioned much debate. You may remember 
that many of the m< mbers of that Congress were anxious 
that too much might not be done or said ; and on the other 
hand, that there were many members who were anxious 
that too little might not be done or said. Hence there 
arose and prevailed a more than ordinary degree of solicitude and watchfulness, both as to the purport of subjectmatter, and to the force and latitude of expressions. And 
hence also it may have happened, that (except the draught 
of a letter to the agents in England) every report made to 
that Congress received amendments of one kind or other, 
before they approved and adopted it. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to present my best respects to <a href='/results.php?tla=aba' rel=''>Mrs. Adams</a>. 
It gives me pleasure to reflect, that your friendship for me 
has from of " old"' continued steadfast, and that my estimation of it has constantly animated the attachment with which 
I have so long been, and am, dear sir,

</p><p>
My good Friend. 
</p><p>
In my letter to you of the 16th October Inst, I hinted that 
I might perhaps write and send you a few more lines on 
the question, Whether war of every description is forbidden 
by the gospel ? 
</p><p>
I will now add some remarks to those which were inserted in my answer to your first letter. In that answer, 
the lawfulness of Mar, in certain cases, was inferred from 
those divine positive institutions which authorized and regulated it. For although those institutions were not dictated 
by the moral law, yet they eannot be understood to authorize what the moral law forbids. 
</p><p>
The moral or natural law was given by the Sovereign of 
the universe to all mankind ; with them it was coeval, and 
with them it will be coexistent. Being founded by infinite 
wisdom and goodness on essential right, which never varies, 
it can require no amendment nor alteration. 
</p><p>
Divine positive ordinances and institutions, on the other 
hand, being founded on expediency, which is not always 
perpetual or immutable, admit of, and have received, alteration and limitation in sundry instances. 
</p><p>
There were several divine positive ordinances and institutions at very early periods. Some of them were of limited obligation, as circumcision ; others of them were of 
universal obligation, as the Sabbath, marriage, sacrifices, 
the particular punishment for murder. 
</p><p>
The Lord of the Sabbath caused the day to be changed. 
The ordinances of Moses suffered the Israelites to exercise 
more than the original liberty allowed to marriage, but our 
Saviour repealed that indulgence. When sacrifices had 
answered their purpose as types of the greal Sacrifice, &c, 
they ceased. The punishment for murder has undergone 
no alteration, either by Moses or by Christ. 
</p><p>
I advert to this distinction between the moral law and 
positive institutions, because it enables us to distinguish 
the reasonings which apply to the one, from those which 
apply only to the other — ordinances being mutable, but the 
moral law always the same. 
</p><p>
To this you observe, by way of objection, that the law 
was given by Moses, but that grace and truth came by 
Jesus Christ ; and hence that even as it relates to the moral 
law, a more perfect system is enjoined by the gospel than 
was required under the law ; which admitted of an eye for 
an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, tolerating a spirit of retaliation. And further, that if the moral law was the same 
now that it was before the flood, we must call in question 
those precepts of the gospel which prohibit some things 
allowed of, and practised by the patriarchs. 
</p><p>
It is true that the law was given by Moses, not however 
in his individual or private capacity, but as the agent or 
instrument, and by the authority of the Almighty. The 
law demanded exact obedience, and proclaimed, " Cursed is 
every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them." The law was 
inexorable, and by requiring perfect obedience, under a 
penalty so inevitable and dreadful, operated as a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ for mercy. 
</p><p>
Mercy, and grace, and favour did come by Jesus Christ ; 
and also that truth which verified the promises and predictions concerning him, and which exposed and corrected the 
various errors which had been imbibed respecting the 
Supreme Being, his attributes, laws, and dispensations. 
Uninspired commentators have dishonoured the law, by 
ascribing to it, in certain cases, a sense and meaning which 
it did not authorize, and which our Saviour rejected and 
reproved. 
</p><p>
The inspired prophets, on the contrary, express the most 
exalted ideas of the law. They declare that the law of the 
Lord is perfect ; that the statutes of the Lord are right ; 
and that the commandment of the Lord is pure ; that God 
would magnify the law, and make it honourable, &zc. 
</p><p>
Our Saviour himself assures us, that he came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfil. That who 
</p><p>
shall do and teach the commandments, shall be called great 
in the kingdom of heaven : that it is easier for heaven and 
earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail. This certainly amounts to a full approbation of it. Even after the 
resurrection of our Lord, and after the descent of the Holy 
Spirit, and after the miraculous conversion of Paul, and 
after the direct revelation of the Christian dispensation to 
him, he pronounced this memorable encomium on the law, 
viz : " The law is holy, and the commandments holy, just, 
and good" 
</p><p>
It is true that one of the positive ordinances of Moses, to 
which you allude, did ordain retaliation, or in other words, 
a tooth for a tooth. But we are to recollect that it was 
ordained, not as a rule to regulate the conduct of private 
individuals towards each other, but as a legal penalty or 
punishment for certain offences. Retaliation is also manifest in the punishment prescribed for murder — life for life. 
Legal punishments are adjudged and inflicted by the law 
and magistrate, and not by unauthorized individuals. These 
and all other positive laws or ordinances established by 
Divine direction, must of necessity be consistent with the 
moral law. It certainly was not the design of the law or 
ordinance in question, to encourage a spirit of personal or 
private revenge. On the contrary, there are express injunctions in the law of Moses, which inculcate a very different 
spirit; such as these: "Thou shalt not avenge, nor hear 
any grudge against the children of thy people ; but thou 
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." " Love the stran 
for ye were strangers in Egypt." "If thou meet thy 
enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring 
it back to him," &c. &c. 
</p><p>
There is reason to believe that Solomon understood the 
law in its true sense, and we have his opinion as to retaliation of injuries, viz : " Say not, I will recompense evil ; but 
wait upon the Lord, and he will save thee." Again, " Say 
not, I will do to him as he hath done to me. I will render 
to the man according to his work." And again, " If thine 
enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat ; and if he be 
thirsty, give him water to drink ; for thou shall heap coals 
of fire upon his head, and the Lord shall reward thee." 
</p><p>
But a greater than Solomon has removed all doubts on 
this point. On being asked by a Jewish lawyer, which was 
the great commandment in the law, our Saviour answered, 
" Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and 
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first 
and the great commandment, and the second is like unto it ; 
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two 
commandments hang all the law and the prophets." It is 
manifest, therefore, that the love of God and the love of 
man are enjoined by the law ; and as the genuine love of 
the one comprehends that of the other, the apostle assures 
us that " Love is the fulfilling of the law" 
</p><p>
It is, nevertheless, certain, that erroneous opinions respecting retaliation, and who were to be regarded as neighbours, had long prevailed, and that our Saviour blamed and 
corrected those and many other unfounded doctrines. 
</p><p>
That the patriarchs sometimes violated the moral law, is 
a position not to be disputed. They were men, and subject 
to the frailties of our fallen nature. But I do not know nor 
believe, that any of them violated the moral law by the 
authority or with the approbation of the Almighty. I can 
find no instance of it in the Bible. Nor do I know of any 
action done according to the moral law, that is censured or 
forbidden by the gospel. On the contrary, it appears to 
me that the gospel strongly enforces the whole moral law, 
and clears it from the vain traditions and absurd comments 
which had obscured and misapplied certain parts of it. 
</p><p>
As, therefore, Divine ordinances did authorize just war — 
as those ordinances were necessarily consistent with the 
moral law, and as the moral law is incorporated in the 
Christian dispensation, I think it follows, that the right to 
W&gejust and necessary war is admitted, and not abolished 
by the gospel. 
</p><p>
You seem to doubt whether there ever was a just war, 
and that it would puzzle even Solomon to find one. 
</p><p>
Had such a doubt been proposed to Solomon, an answer 
to it would probably have been suggested to him by a very 
memorable and interesting war which occurred in his day. 
I allude to the war in which his brother Absalom on the 
one side, and his father David on the other, were the belligerent parties. That war was caused by, and proceeded 
from " the lusts" of Absalom, and was horribly wicked. 
But the war waged against him by David, was not caused 
by, nor did proceed from " the lusts" of David, but was 
right, just, and necessary. Had David submitted to be 
dethroned by his detestable son, he would, in my opinion, 
have violated his moral duty and betrayed his official trust. 
</p><p>
Although just war is not forbidden by the gospel in express terms, yet you think an implied prohibition of all war, 
without exception, is deducible from the answer of our Lord 
to Pilate, viz : " If my kingdom were of this world, then 
would my servants fight," &c. 
</p><p>
At the conclusion of the last supper, our Lord said to his 
disciples, " He that hath no sword, let him now sell his garment and buy one." They answered, " Lord, here are two 
swords." He replied, " It is enough." 
</p><p>
It is not to be presumed that our Lord would have 
ordered swords to be provided, but for some purpose for 
which a sword was requisite, nor that he would have been 
satisfied with two, if more had been necessary. 
</p><p>
Whatever may have been the purposes for which swords 
were ordered, it is certain that the use of one of those 
swords soon caused an event, which confirmed the subsequent defence of our Lord before Pilate, and also produced 
other important results. When the officers and their band 
arrived, with swords and with staves, to take Jesus, they 
who were about him saw what would follow. " They said 
unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword ?" It does 
not appear that any of the eleven disciples who were with 
him, except one, made the least attempt to defend him. 
But Peter, probably inferring from the order for swords, 
that they were now to be used, proceeded to " smite a servant of the high-priest, and cut off his right ear." Jesus 
(perhaps, among other reasons, to abate inducements to 
prosecute Peter for that violent attack) healed the ear. 
</p><p>
He ordered Peter to put his sword into its sheath, and 
gave him two reasons for it. The first related to himself, 
and amounted to this, that he would make no opposition, 
saying, " The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I 
not drink ?" The second related to Peter, viz. they who 
take the sword, shall perish by the sword ; doubtless 
meaning that they who take and use a sword, as Peter had 
just done, without lawful authority, and against lawful 
authority, incur the penalty and risk of perishing by the 
sword. This meaning seems to be attached to those words 
by the occasion and circumstances which prompted them. 
If understood in their unlimited latitude, they would contradict the experience and testimony of all ages, it being 
manifest that many military men die peaceably in their 
beds. 
</p><p>
The disciples did believe and expect that Jesus had 
come to establish a temporal kingdom. " They trusted 
that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel." 
" They knew not the Scripture, that he must rise again 
from the dead ; questioning one with another what the 
rising from the dead should mean." Even after his resurrection, they appear to have entertained the same belief 
and expectation ; for on the very day he ascended, they 
asked him, " Lord, wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel V 
The order for swords, and the declaration that two were 
enough, tended to confirm that belief and expectation, and 
to inspire a confidence that he who had commanded the 
winds and the waves, and had raised the dead to life, was 
able, as well as willing, to render the two swords sufficient 
to vanquish his enemies. Could any thing less than such a 
firm belief and confidence have prompted eleven such men, 
and with only two swords among them, to offer to "smite 
with the sword" the armed band, which under officers appointed by the Jewish rulers, had come to apprehend their 
master \ 
</p><p>
Great must have been the disappointment and astonishment of the disciples, when Jesus unexpectedly and peaceably submitted to the power and malice of his enemies, 
directing Peter to sheath his sword, and hinting to him the 
danger he had incurred by drawing it: amazed and terrified, they forsook him and lied. This catastrophe so surprised, and subdued the intrepidity of Peter, as that he was 
no longer " ready to go with his master to prison and to 
death." 
</p><p>
It seems that perplexity, consternation, and tumultuous 
feelings overwhelmed his faith and reflection, and that his 
agitations receiving fresh excitement from the danger and 
dread of discovery, which soon after ensued, impelled him 
with heedless precipitation to deny his Master. This denial proved bitter to Peter, and it taught him and others that 
spiritual strength can be sustained only by the spiritual 
bread which cometh down from heaven. 
</p><p>
The Jews accused Jesus before Pilate of aspiring to the 
temporal sovereignty of their nation, in violation of the 
regal rights of Caesar. Jesus, in his defence, admitted that 
he was King, but declared that his kingdom was not of this 
world. For the truth of this assertion, he appealed to the 
peaceable behaviour of his adherents, saying, "If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I 
should not be delivered to the Jews, but now is my kingdom 
not from hence." 
</p><p>
Pilate, who doubtless well knew what had been the conduct of Jesus, both before and at the time of his apprehension, was satisfied, but the Jews were not. They exclaimed, " If thou let this man go, thou art not Cassar's 
friend ; whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against 
Caesar." " We have no king but Caesar." 
</p><p>
You and I understand the words in question very differently. Is there the least reason to infer from the belief and 
conduct of the disciples, that they were restrained from 
fighting by the consideration that their Master's kingdom 
was not of this world ? On the contrary, did they not believe and expect that he had come to restore one of the 
kingdoms of this world to Israel ? The fact is, that they 
were ready and willing to fight. Did they not ask him, 
" Lord, shall we smite with the sword V It was his will, 
therefore, and not their will, which restrained them from 
fighting ; and for that restraint he assigned a very conclusive reason, viz. because his kingdom was not of this 
world. 
</p><p>
To the advancement and support of his spiritual sovereignty over his spiritual kingdom, soldiers and swords, 
and corporeal exertions were inapplicable and useless. 
But, on the other hand, soldiers and swords, and corporeal 
exertions are necessary to enable the several temporal 
rulers of the states and kingdoms of this world, to maintain 
their authority and protect themselves and their people ; 
and our Saviour expressly declared, that if his kingdom 
had been of this world, then would his servants fight to 
protect him ; or in other words, that then and in that case, 
he would not have restrained them from fighting. The 
lawfulness bf such fighting, therefore, instead of being 
denied, is admitted and confirmed by that declaration. 
</p><p>
This exposition coincides with the answer given by John 
the Baptist (who was " filled with the Holy Ghost") to the 
soldiers who asked him what they should do, viz. " Do 
violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely, and be content with your wages." Can these words be rationally understood as meaning thai they should receive wages for 
nothingl Or, that when ordered to march against the 
enemy, they should refuse to proceed ; or that, on meeting 
the enemy, they should either run away, or passively submit to be captured or slaughtered ' This would be attaching a meaning to his answer very foreign to the sense of 
the words in which he expressed it. 
</p><p>
Had the gospel regarded war as being in every case sinful, it seems strange that the apostle Paul should have been 
so unguarded, as in teaching the importance of faith, to 
use an argument which clearly proves the lawfulness of 
war, viz. " That it was through faith that Gideon, David, 
and others waxed valiant in fight, and turned to flight the 
armies of aliens ;" thereby confirming the declaration of 
David, that it was God who had "girded him with strength 
to battle ; and had taught his hands to war, and his fingers 
to fight." 
</p><p>
The gospel appears to me to consider the servants of 
Christ as having two capacities or characters, with correspondent duties to sustain and fulfil. 
</p><p>
Being subjects of his spiritual kingdom, they are bound 
in that capacity to fight pursuant to his orders, with spiritual weapons, against his and their spiritual enemies. 
</p><p>
Being also subjects, and partakers in the rights and interests of a temporal or worldly state or kingdom, they are 
in that capacity bound, whenever lawfully required, to fight 
with weapons in just and necessary war,against the worldly 
enemies of that state or kingdom. 
</p><p>
Another view may be taken of the subject. The depravity which mankind inherited from their first parents, 
introduced wickedness into the world. That wickedness 
rendered human government necessary to restrain the violence and injustice resulting from it. To facilitate the 
establishment and administration of government, the human 
race became, in the course of Providence, divided into 
separate and distinct nations. Every nation instituted a 
government, with authority and power to protect it against 
domestic and foreign aggressions. Each government provided for the internal peace and security of the nation, by 
laws for punishing their offending subjects. The law of all 
the nations prescribed the conduct which they were to observe towards each other, and allowed war to be waged 
by an innocent against an offending nation, when rendered 
just and necessary by unprovoked, atrocious, and unredressed injuries. 
</p><p>
Thus two kinds of justifiable warfare arose — one against 
domestic malefactors ; the other against foreign aggressors. 
The first being regulated by the law of the land ; the 
second by the law of nations ; and both consistently with 
the moral law. 
</p><p>
As to the^rs^ species of warfare, in every state or kingdom, the government or executive ruler has, throughout all 
ages, pursued, and often at the expense of blood, attacked, 
captured, and subdued murderers, robbers, and other offenders. By force confining them in chains and in prisons ; 
and by force inflicting on them punishment, never rendering 
to them good for evil ; for that duty attaches to individuals 
in their personal or private capacities ; but not to rulers or 
magistrates in their official capacities. This species of war 
has constantly and universally been deemed just and indispensable. On this topic the gospel is explicit. It commands us to obey the higher powers or ruler. It reminds 
us " that he beareth not the sword in vain ;" that " he is the 
minister of God, and a revenger to execute wrath upon 
him that doeth evil." Now, if he is not to bear the sword 
in vain, it follows that he is to use it to execute wrath on 
evil doers, and consequently to draw blood and to kill on 
proper occasions. 
As to the second species of warfare, it certainly is 
reasonable and as righl thai a nation be secure against injustice, disorder, and rapine from without, as from within: 
and therefore that it is the right and the duty of the government or ruler, to use force and the sword to protect and 
maintain the rights of his people against evil doers of another nation. The reason and necessity of using force and 
the sword being the same in both eases, the right or the 
law must be the same also. 
</p><p>
We are commanded to render to our government, or to 
our " Caesar, the things that are Caesar's;" that is, the things 
which belong to him, and not the things which do not 
belong to him. And surely this command eannot be construed to intend or imply, that we ought to render to the 
Caesar of another nation more than belongs to him. 
</p><p>
In case some powerful Caesar should demand of us to 
receive and obey a king of his nomination, and unite with 
him in all his wars, or that he would commence hostilities 
against us ; what answer would it be proper for us to give 
to such a demand? In my opinion we ought to refu 
and vigorously defend our independence by arms. To 
what other expedient could we have recourse? I cannot 
think that the gospel authorizes or encourages us, on such 
an occasion, to abstain from resistance, and to expect miracles to deliver us. 
</p><p>
A very feeble unprepared nation, on receiving such a 
demand, might hesitate and find it expedient to adopt the 
policy intimated in the gospel ; viz. " What king, going to 
war against another king, sitteth not down first andconsulteth whether he be aide with ten thousand to meet him that 
cometh against him with twenty thousand ; or else he sendeth an embassage, and desireth conditions of peace," that 
is, makes the best bargain he can. 
</p><p>
If the United States should unanimously resolve never 
more to use the sword, would a certified copy of it prove 
to be an effectual Mediterranean passport ? Would it 
reform the predatory rulers of Africa, or persuade the successive potentates of Europe to observe towards us the 
conduct of real Christians 1 On the contrary, would it not 
present new facilities, and consequently produce new excitements to the gratification of avarice and ambition ? 
</p><p>
It is true, that even just war is attended with evils, and 
so likewise is the administration of government and of 
justice ; but is that a good reason for abolishing either of 
them ? They are means by which greater evils are 
averted. Among the various means necessary to obviate 
or remove, or repress, or to mitigate the various calamities, 
dangers, and exigences, to which in this life we are exposed, how few are to be found which do not subject us to 
troubles, privations, and inconveniences of one kind or 
other. To prevent the incursion or continuance of evils, 
we must submit to the use of those means, whether agreeable or otherwise, which reason and experience prescribe. 
</p><p>
It is also true, and to be lamented, that war, however 
just and necessary, sends many persons out of this world 
who are ill prepared for a better. And so also does the 
law in all countries. So also does navigation and other 
occupations. Are they therefore all sinful and forbidden ? 
</p><p>
However desirable the abolition of all wars may be, yet 
until the morals and manners of mankind are greatly 
changed, it will be found impracticable. We are taught 
that national sins will be punished, and that war is one of 
the punishments. The prophets predict wars at so late a 
period as the restoration of the Israelites. Who or what 
can hinder the occurrence of those wars ? 
</p><p>
I nevertheless believe, and have perfect faith in the prophecy, that the time will come when " the nations will beat 
their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks ; when nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more." But, does 
not this prophecy clearly imply, and give us plainly to understand, that in the meanwhile, and until the arrival of that 
blessed period, the nations will not heat their swords into 
ploughshares, nor their spears into pruning-hooks ; that 
nation will nol forbear to lift up sword against nation, nor 
cease to learn war ' 
</p><p>
It may 1 d, are we to do nothing to hasten the arri
val of that happy period ! Literally, no created being can 
either accelerate or retard its arrival. It will not arrive 
sooner nor later than the appointed time. 
</p><p>
There certainly is reason to expect, that as great providential events have usually been preceded and introduced 
by the intervention of providential means to prepare the 
way for them, so the great event in question will be preceded and introduced in like manner. It is, I think, more 
than probable, that the unexpected and singular co-operation, and the extraordinary zeal and efforts of almost all 
Christian nations to extend the light and knowledge of the 
gospel, and to inculcate its doctrines, are among those preparatory means. It is the duty of Christians to promote 
the prevalence and success of such means, and to look forward with faith and hope to the result of them. 
</p><p>
But, whatever may be the time, or the means adopted 
by <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> for the abolition of war, I think we may, 
without presumption, conclude, that mankind must be prepared and fitted for the reception, enjoyment, and preservation of universal permanent peace, before they will be 
blessed with it. Arc the}- as yet fitted for it? Certainly 
not. Even if it was practicable, would it be wise to disarm 
the good before " the wicked cease from troubling ?" By 
what other means than arms and military force, can unoffending rulers and nations protect their rights against 
unprovoked aggressions from within and from without? 
Are there any other means to which they could recur, and 
on the efficacy of which they could rely ? To this question I have not as yet heard, nor seen, a direct and precise 
answer. 
These remarks would have been written and sent sooner, 
had my health been better. Expedition not being requisite, 
I attended to them only at intervals which allowed and invited me to do so. 
</p><p>
We differ in opinion, and I am persuaded with equal 
sincerity. 
</p><p>
With real esteem and regard, I remain, 
</p><p>
Your friend,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have read your letter of the 12th ult. more than once. 
Mutuality of friendly feelings always affords gratification ; 
and the kindness which pervades your letter has made its 
proper impressions. 
</p><p>
As you are in the seventy-fifth year of your age, and I in 
the seventy- fourth of mine, our leases have expired. We 
are holding over, and others will soon occupy our places. 
</p><p>
What to do, and where to go, would be perplexing questions, had not our beneficent Lessor offered us better and 
permanent habitations. 
</p><p>
The death of an excellent daughter last spring was an 
afflicting event, and I feel it. Convinced that her happiness 
was augmented by it, I had no reason to grieve on her account. I derived consolation, as well as resignation, from 
reflecting that unerring wisdom had directed that dispensation, and that I was still blessed with the surviving children, 
who (like their sister) had never given me any other uneasiness than what had arisen from their sickness or afflictions. 
</p><p>
Considering the times which have passed over us, I am 
glad you continued in office. Might not reports of some 
select cases decided in your court be useful 1 And would 
they not be more correctly prepared for the press by yourself than by others ? 
</p><p>
In my opinion, you did well to abstain from speculations. 
I thought so, and did so. It is, I believe, a just and not a 
new remark, that a proper education and proper habits, 
with a moderate share of property, form a better provision 
for a child, than that greater degree of wealth, which not 
unfrequently leads the unexperienced to idleness and its 
results. 
</p><p>
I have looked into the book which you had the goodness 
to send me, and for which I thank you. I have read the 
address, and the notices for a young farmer. They will do 
good. Although unable to attend much to my own agricultural affairs, yet books and conversation on such subjects 
entertain me. I wish I could give you a good account of 
my Tunisian sheep, but the dogs have put it out of my 
power. I regret the loss they caused ; but I regret it less 
than another loss, which more nearly affects my convenience. I allude to the death of a favourite mare, which I 
had rode for twenty- three years with great satisfaction. 
She lately died suddenly and unexpectedly, in the twentyninth year of her age. She was the third in succession, 
which died in my service. The grandam was given to me 
</p><p>
by my father in <a href='/results.php?year=1765'>1765</a>. That circumstance associated with 
various others in attaching me to them. 
</p><p>
Agricultural societies arc multiplying in this State. One 
has been formed in this county, and 1 am the nominal president ; having only the will and not the ability to render 
active services. They have prepared a representation to 
the Legislature respecting agriculture, and the expediency 
oi establishing an agricultural society for the whole State. 
</p><p>
The traits of parsimonious and reluctant commendation 
observable in some of your British letters, give more intelligence than the writers meant to convey. As almost every 
vagrant leaf we pick up will inform us of the kind of tree 
which produced it, so these traits discover the feelings 
which originated them. It is a pity that such feelings should 
exist; but they are the offspring of human nature, which is 
not what it should be, nor what it once was. That Britons 
should reflect on our former and present state and condition, 
without regret, without mortification, and without apprehensions of rivalry and perhaps of danger, can hardly be 
expected. A doubt whether Britannia will always "rule 
the waves," cannot have a welcome reception in her mind. 
Our rapid progress in trade, navigation, and the arts, cannot 
correspond with her views and wishes. The strength 
resulting from our increasing resources and population, 
recommends a kind of policy and a degree of accommodation not congenial with the temper and propensities of such 
a nation. Superiors seldom see with complacency inferiors 
rising towards equality, and by means which may not improbably carry them beyond it. There is, nevertheless, 
great worth in Britain. 
</p><p>
I have not seen <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a>'s Life. As he concurred in the opinion of Count de Vergennes, that we should proceed 
to treat for peace with Great Britain without a previous 
admission of our independence, he may, in his own mind, 
have acquitted the count of the motives to which I ascribed 
his giving us that opinion ; and also have considered his 
subsequent explanations on that and certain other topics 
as satisfactory. After mv return in <a href='/results.php?year=1784'>1784</a>, I was informed 
of the debate in Congress on the proposed resolution which 
you mention. In my opinion, <a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague'>Mr. Madison</a></a> voted consistently. I omit explaining this at present, for it cannot be 
done in a few words. My letter to Congress respecting 
the negotiation contained a full and correct statement of 
facts. Many years have since elapsed, but my sentiments 
relative to the policy adopted by France on that occasion 
continue unaltered. 
</p><p>
But it is time to conclude, and I will do it by thanking 
you for affording me so agreeable an occasion to assure you 
of the esteem and regard, with which I continue

</p><p>
I thank you, my good friend, for the kind letter (without 
date) which my son lately delivered to me, and for the 
pamphlets which were enclosed with it. 
</p><p>
The observations of your friend (inserted in your letter) 
are well written. I am pleased with the writer. He reasons with ability, and abstains from declamation. The 
lawfulness of the invasion and conquest of Canaan, being 
made by express Divine command, is indubitable. It does 
not decide the question, whether any wars, unless so commanded, are permitted by the moral law, and consequently 
by the gospel. Such wars occurred both before and after 
the time of Moses, and are recorded in Scripture without 
reproof. It does not appear that the war of Abraham 
against the kings was made by Divine command, nor that 
Jacob was commanded to take " out of the hand of the 
Amorite, with His sword and his how," the portion which 
he gave to Josepii ; nor does it appear that the war of 
David against Ilanun, and divers other wars, were so 
commanded. 
</p><p>
That the theocracy admitted of no other wars by the 
Israelites hut such as were expressly commanded by the 
Almighty, is not clear to me. Had Solomon heen of that 
opinion, I think he could not with propriety have taught 
that "by counsel thou shalt make war ; and in a multitude 
of counsellors there is safety. Every purpose is established 
by counsel; and with good advice make war." 
</p><p>
This, and other topics with which it is connected, open a 
wide field for investigation; but as the state of my health 
does not permit me to be more particular, I will only add, 
that when the arguments in favour of just and necessary 
war shall be shown to be fallacious, I shall not only think, 
but also act accordinglv. 
</p><p>
The extract from William Penn forms a useful tract ; 
and among other reasons, because it declares that '-'the 
Scriptures were given forth by holy men of God in divers 
ages, as they were moved by the Holy Spirit." I observe 
that this great truth is also inculcated by the trustees of the 
African Free School in their address. 
</p><p>
I did hope to have found in your letter some tidings respecting your brother. When you write to him, assure 
him of my esteem and regard ; and he pleased to accept 
the like assurance from

Sir, 
</p><p>
I received by the last mail the pamphlet on " the Missouri Question," which you did me the favour to send. 
The remarks and statements contained in it place the 
pernicious influence of slavery on the welfare of our country in conspicuous and impressive points of view. 
</p><p>
The obvious dictates both of morality and policy teach 
us, that our free nation cannot encourage the extension of 
slavery, nor the multiplication of slaves, without doing 
violence to their principles, and without depressing their 
power and prosperity. 
</p><p>
It appears to me desirable, that your remarks and statements, as well as the excellent arguments of <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='colleague met'>Mr. King</a>, 
should be widely diffused ; they will have a strong tendency 
to render public opinion on this very important subject correct and settled.

I thank you cordially, my good and constant friend, for 
your letter of the 25th ult. It affords me no little gratification. We grow old, but our hearts retain their warmth. 
</p><p>
The perversion and obliquity you notice has not been 
recent nor unexpected. Men who are ardent in the pursuit of influence and its fruits, and more attentive to the 
prosecution than to the propriety of their schemes, usually 
become and remain hostile to those who steadfastly disapprove of their manoeuvres. Instead of regulating their hostility by truth and candour, they generally find it convenient to recur to perversion and obliquity. 
</p><p>
The conventional statement to which you allude, was 
doubtless devised and formed, in the manner which its projectors deemed to be best accommodated to the objects they 
had in view. So many years have elapsed since the negotiations at Paris, that only a few individuals among the 
present members of any oi our popular assemblies, probably 
possess ample and accurate knowledge of those negotiations. 
</p><p>
On considering your hint of my making some statement 
of facts relative to them, in addition to my letter to Congress, which, you observe, may (like the papers of the war 
office) be accidentally destroyed, I think that precaution 
will not be necessary. I have a honk in which are i 
that and all my other official letters to Congress. 
</p><p>
An accurate and well-written history of the United States, 
down to the conclusion of the late war, is desirable. But 
my expectations on that head are not sanguine. Time is 
daily obscuring and diminishing the materials, and the task 
becoming more and more difficult. The marks of talent 
and rectitude which appear in the Life of Washington, by 
Judge Marshall, have induced me to regret that he had 
not commenced such a history, and incorporated that life 
in it. The mass of information he has collected continues 
to afford facilities for such a work, and it would more than 
answer the purpose of a new edition of the other. Whoever may undertake it, would, in my opinion, do well to 
give it the advantage of frequent revision, and postpone the 
publication until a period when the events and circumstances related in it, had ceased to produce personal and 
political excitement. 
</p><p>
I rejoice in your continuing to enjoy good health. I will 
not say with the Spaniards, "may you live a thousand 
years;" for that would postpone greater blessings. The 
name and character of Judge Washington interest me in his 
welfare. I hope he will be restored to health. The prevailing disease which attacked him, I suspect, was the 
same which visited us — influenza. Few families here 
escaped. I have had it, but not severely: it has left a 
cough, which still gives me some trouble. Although too 
feeble to go often beyond the piazza, yet I experience no 
depression of spirits, nor frequent returns of acute pain. 
Here also the distress of the times is felt very sensibly. 
Habits of expense, unproductive speculations, and debts 
injudiciously contracted, press hard both upon debtors and 
creditors. How long this state of things will continue, 
or how much good or evil will eventually result from it, 
cannot now be calculated. They who hope for the best 
and prepare for the worst, will doubtless mitigate some of 
their troubles, and probably obviate the occurrence of some 
others. 
</p><p>
God bless you, my dear sir.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your letter of the 23d ult. expressing a 
desire that Botta's History and your Translation of it may 
have my approbation ; and also that I would mention to 
you the most authentic of the documents which are before 
the public, relative to the negotiations at Paris in <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a>. 
</p><p>
Having, as yet, received and read only the first volume 
of the History, I cannot form, and consequently cannot express, an opinion of the whole work. 
</p><p>
As to the first volume, there are in it certain assertions, 
representations, and suggestions, of which there are some 
which I believe to be erroneous, and others which I suspect 
to be inaccurate. Being too feeble either to write or to 
re id much at a time without fatigue, I forbear to enumerate 
them. I will nevertheless, for your satisfaction, select and 
notice one of the most important, viz. That anterior to the 
revolution, there existed in the colonies a desire of independence. 
</p><p>
The following extracts respect this topic : viz. 
Page 10. — "The love of the sovereign and their ancient 
countrv, which the first colonists might have retained in 
their new establishments, gradually diminished in the hearts 
of their descendants." 
</p><p>
Page 11. — •• The greater part of the colonists had heard 
nothing of Great Britain, excepting that it was a distant 
kingdom, from which their ancestors had been barbarously 
expelled." 
</p><p>
Pane 12. — "As the means of restraint became almost 
illusory in the hands of the government, there must 1, 
arisen and gradually increased in the minds of the Am 
cans, the hope, and with it the desire, to shake off the yoke 
of English superiority." " The colonists supported impatiently the superiority of the British government." 
</p><p>
Page 15. — "Such was the state of the English colonies in America; such the opinions and dispositions of those 
who inhabited them, about the middle of the eighteenth century" " It was impossible that they should have remained 
ignorant of what they were capable; and that the pisive development of national pride should not have rendered the British yoke intolerable." 
</p><p>
Pace 33. — " Alreadv those who were the most zealous 
for liberty, or the most ambitious, had formed, in the secret 
of their hearts, the resolution to shake off the yoke of 1 
land, whenever a favourable occasion should present. This 
design was encouraged by the recent cession of Canada." 
</p><p>
Page 199. — "The colonists looked upon it (the Congress 
of <a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a>) as a convention of men who, in some mode or 
other, were to deliver their country from the perils that 
menaced it. The greater part believed that their ability, 
&c. would enable them to obtain from the government a 
removal of the evils that oppressed them, and the re-establishment of the ancient order of things. Some others 
cherished the belief that they would find means to conduct 
the American nation to that independence which was the 
first and most ardent of their aspirations ; or rather the 
sole object of that intense passion which stung and tormented them night and day." 
</p><p>
Page 314. — "Both (Putnam and Ward) had declared 
themselves too openly in favour of independence. The 
Congress desired indeed to procure it, but withal in a propitious ti i.e." 
</p><p>
Page 388. — " Thus censed, as we have related, the royal 
authority in the different provinces. It was replaced progressively by that of the people ; that is, by Congresses or 
Conventions extraordinary, that were formed in each 
colony. But this was deemed insufficient by those who 
directed the affairs of America; their real object being 
independence" &c. 
</p><p>
Explicit professions and assurances of allegiance and 
loyalty to the sovereign (especially since the accession of 
King William), and of affection for the mother country, 
abound in lire journals of the colonial Legislatures, and of 
the Congresses and Conventions, from early periods to the 
second petition of Congress in <a href='/results.php?year=1775'>1775</a>. 
</p><p>
If these professions and assurances were sincere, they 
afford evidence more than sufficient to invalidate the charge 
of our desiring and aiming at independence. 
</p><p>
If, on the other hand, these professions and assurances 
were factitious and deceptive, they present to the world an 
unprecedented instance of long continued, concurrent, and 
detestable duplicity in the colonies. Our country does not 
deserve this odious and disgusting imputation. During the 
course of my life, and until after the second petition of 
Congress in <a href='/results.php?year=1775'>1775</a>, I never did hear any American of any 
class, or of any description, express a wish for the independence of the colonies. 
</p><p>
Few Americans had more, or better means and opportunities of becoming acquainted with the sentiments anddispositions of the colonists, relative to public affairs, than 
<a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a>. In a letter to his son, dated the 22d March, <a href='/results.php?year=1775'>1775</a>, he relates a conversation which he had with Lord Chatham in the preceding month of August. His lordship 
having mentioned an opinion prevailing in England, that 
America aimed at setting up for herself as an independent state, the Dr. thus expressed himself: "I assured him. 
that having more than once travelled almost from i 
end of the continent to the other, and kept a great variety 
of company, eating, drinking, and conversing with them 
freely, I never had heard in any conversation from any 
person, drunk or sober, the least expression of a wish for a 
separation, or a hint that such a thing would be advantageous to America." 
</p><p>
It does not appear to me necessary to enlarge further on 
this subject. It has always been and still is my opinion 
and belief, that our country was prompted and impelled to 
independence by necessity, and not by choice. They who 
know how we were then circumstanced, know from 
whence that necessity resulted. 
</p><p>
It would, indeed, be extraordinary, if a foreigner, remote (like Mr. Botta) from the best sources of authentic 
information, should, in writing such a history, commit no 
mistakes. That gentleman doubtless believed his narrations to be true, but it is not improbable that he sometimes selected his materials with too little apprehension 
of error, and that some of his informers were too little 
scrupulous. This remark derives a degree of weight from 
the following passage in the History, viz. <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague'>General Montgomery</a> "left a wife, the object of all his tenderness, with 
several children, still infants, a spectacle tor their country, 
at once of pity and admiration. The state, from gratitude 
towards their father, distinguished them with every mark 
of kindness and protection.*' 1 have been acquainted with 
<a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague'>General Montgomery</a>'s widow from my youth. The fact 
is, that she never had a child.

In making the translation, attention has doubtless been 
paid to the rule, that a translator should convey into his 
translation, with perspicuity and precision, the ideas of his 
author, and no others, and express them, not literally, but 
in well-adapted classical language. How far your translation is exactly correct, I am an incompetent judge ; for not 
understanding the language of the original, I cannot examine and compare the translation with it. Of the style 
and manner of the translation, I think well. 
</p><p>
Which are the most authentic documents before the public, relative to the negotiations at Paris in <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a>, is a question which I am not in capacity to answer. Many years 
have elapsed since I have read any of them, and others 
have since been published which I have not seen. Without 
a previous and careful examination of each of them, it 
would be rash and unfair to give a preference to either.

On receiving your first letter, I conjectured that you 
was of the respectable family of your name in Massachusetts ; and that conjecture appears from your last to 
have been well founded. If, in going from- <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> to

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My letter to you of the 20th December last, contained 
some remarks relative to the perversions and obliquities 
which you had noticed, and which I observed were neither 
recent nor unexpected. In that letter, there was not room 
for explanatory details. Those remarks were therefore 
concise and general. To supply that deficiency is the 
design of this letter. 
</p><p>
These perversions and obliquities began on the receipt of 
a letter which I wrote to Congress, and of which the following is a copy. 
</p><p>
[Here was inserted the letter of 20/// Sept., <a href='/results.php?year=1781'>1781</a>, relative 
to the instruction to the American commissioners appointed 
to negotiate the treaty of peace. See vol. i. p. 121.] 
</p><p>
This letter was written under the influence of indignant 
feelings, and in some respects with too little of deliberate 
consideration. The impressions it made on those who had 
originated and urged the instruction mentioned in it. may 
easily be conceived. 
</p><p>
That this instruction was more complimentary than wise, 
was afterward evinced by the circumstances which constrained the American commissioners at Paris to disobey 
it. That disobedience gave additional excitement to the 
displeasure and to the complaints of the French and their 
consociates. Nor were they pleased with the implied 
approbation of that disobedience, which resulted from my 
appointment to the office of secretary for foreign affairs, 
before my arrival in <a href='/results.php?year=1784'>1784</a>. From time to time after my 
return, I was informed of various incidents which showed 
that their malevolence was far from being dormant. 
</p><p>
The presumptuous attempts of the republican minister 
Genet, to facilitate the designs of France at the hazard of 
our peace and neutrality, gave occasion to the measures of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>President Washington</a> on that subject. Disappointed and 
irritated by these impediments, Genet and his partisans indulged themselves in animadversions on the administration 
and its advocates, which were neither candid nor decorous. 
</p><p>
The treaty with England in <a href='/results.php?year=1794'>1794</a>, did not accord with the 
views and wishes of France, nor with the views and wishes of 
sundry individuals among us. Although the strenuous efforts 
made to defeat it did not succeed, yet the feelings and motives which prompted those efforts continued to operate. 
</p><p>
Certain politicians, desirous to give a new direction to 
public opinion, finally succeeded in forming a party for the 
purpose, and in introducing a policy varying from that 
which <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>President Washington</a> and his friends had preferred. 
Those friends were not regarded with a friendly eye. 
</p><p>
They who censured the precipitate commencement, and 
the unsuccessful conduct of the late war with England, 
incurred the resentment of those by whom these errors 
were committed. 
</p><p>
Among those who had been active federalists, there were 
individuals who, at subsequent periods, were induced to 
think it expedient for them to join the opposing party. 
They who thus pass from one side to the other, are apt to 
mistake cunning for wisdom, and to act accordinglv. 
</p><p>
These details will suffice to explain the concise remarks 
in my letter. Many more might be added, and I could fill much paper with apposite anecdotes; but T forbear to enlarge on topics which (mutatis mutandis) the history of 
Greece and other countries, as well as observation and 
experience, have rendered familiar to us both. 
</p><p>
In the course of my public life, I have en ured to be 
</p><p>
uniform and independent ; having, from the I of it 
</p><p>
in <a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a>, never asked for an office or a vote, nor declined 
expressing my sentiments respecting such important public 
measures as, in my opinion, tended to promote or retard the 
welfare of our country. 
</p><p>
lou will, I am persuaded, pardon this egotism, and believe me to be, dear sir, 
</p><p>

My good Friend, 
</p><p>
It gives me pleasure to learn from my son, that, in a 
letter lately received by your nephew, you made inquiries 
respecting me. 
</p><p>
We have both experienced afflicting dispensations. Your 
portion of health has for a long time been diminished ; and 
I have not had a well day for the last twelve years. You 
have been deprived of an excellent brother, who was an 
excellent man ; and I of several relations, and particularly 
of an amiable and affectionate daughter. It is a comfort to 
hope and believe, that such dispensations answer merciful 
purposes, and that the time will come when we shall rejoice 
in having been reminded by adversity, that temporal enjoyments are transient. 
</p><p>
The winter having been more cold than common, has 
confined me to the house during the course of it ; and the 
weather this spring has not yet so mild as to admit of 
</p><p>
my going abroad without risk. x'Uthough my old complaint 
has gradually reduced me to a state of incurable debility, yet 
I seldom suffer from acute pain, except occasionally from 
rheumatism. In various respects, I have abundant reason 
to be thankful. 
</p><p>
We have both passed the usual term of human life, or 
(as the lawyers say) our leases have expired, and we are 
now holding over. To be thus circumstanced, is not very 
important to those who expect to remove from their present 
abodes to better habitations, and to enjoy them in perpetuity. That we may both be, and continue to be, numbered with these, is the sincere desire of 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend,

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received, and thank you for, the interesting report 
of the joint committee of both houses of your Legislature, 
relative to certain proceedings of the Bank of the United 
States, which you were so obliging as to send me. 
</p><p>
Controversies between the national and a state government, or any of their respective departments, are to be 
regretted. It is desirable that the one which occasioned 
this report, should be brought to an amicable and satisfactory termination ; and that the limits which bound the authorities of the national and state governments be well ascertained and observed. 
</p><p>
However extensive the constitutional power of a government to impose taxes may be, I think it should not be so 
exercised as to impede or discourage the lawful and useful 
industry and exertions of individuals. Hence, the prudence 
of taxing the products of beneficial labour, either mental or 
manual, appears to be at least questionable. 
</p><p>
Whether taxation should extend only to property, or 
only to income, or to both, are points on which opinions 
have not been uniform. I am inclined to think, that both 
should not be taxed. If the first is preferred, then tax the 
land and stock of a farmer, but not his crops ; tax his milchcows, but not their milk, nor the butter and cheese made of 
it, whether the same be sent to market or consumed in his 
family. Tax the real and personal estate of a physician 
and a lawyer, but not the conjectural and varying profits 
they derive from the skilful and industrious exercise of 
their professions, &c. &c. 
</p><p>
On this and similar subjects, there will be different opinions. Our minds are probably as little alike as our features ; and it is not uncommon for men of unquestionable 
talents and candour to take opposite sides of the same question : neither of them being culpable, both are entitled to 
allowances for the risk of committing mistakes, to which 
we are all more or less exposed. 
</p><p>
It is an agreeable circumstance that prosperity attends 
you ; and permit me to add, that for its continuance and 
increase, you have the best wishes of 
</p><p>

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your letter of the 8th ultimo, and a subsequent one not dated. Your Dictionary will doubtless 
derive utility and reputation from the extensive investigations you mention. The assiduity with which yon have for 
many years persevered, and still persevere, in accomplishing that arduous task, will, I hope, be followed by results, 
not only beneficial to the public, but also to yourself. 
There are gentlemen in this country by whom, I presume, judicious criticisms and friendly offices would be 
readily afforded. In case a further revision should be 
undertaken with zeal and good-will, at <a href='/results.php?city=oxford' rel='city'>Oxford</a> or <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, and terminate with explicit commendation, it would 
excite attention both in Britain and America, and produce 
useful consequences. 
</p><p>
To whatever persons the perusal of the manuscripts may 
be committed, permit me to hint that they should be very 
legible. This remark is sucrsrested bv the recollection of an 
incident which occurred many years since. The author of 
a large manuscript, written in an indistinct hand, requested 
a certain gentleman to favour him with his opinion of it. 
The gentleman, after a while, returned it, with some polite 
general observations of little importance. It seems he 
" had neither time nor patience to decipher much of it." 
</p><p>
Should circumstances occur to render it highly probable 
that your attending a revision in England would eventually 
promote sales in both countries, or ensure a good price for 
the copy, the expense incurred by it might be more than 
compensated. As several years are still necessary to 
finish the work, and as occurrences may in the mean time 
create objections or afford facilities which cannot now be 
foreseen, the question, what posterior measures would be 
advisable, may probably be more easily answered at a future 
day than at present. 
</p><p>
Your intention to favour me with a visit next summer 
gives me pleasure. Whether our lives will be prolonged 
to that period, depends on that good <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> on which 
you happily and wisely rely, and whose beneficence I hope 
you will continue to experience.

Sir, 
</p><p>
On the 20th inst. I received a copy of your report to the 
General Assembly of Louisiana, under a cover directed to 
me. To whom I am indebted for it, (\<>r< not appear ; the 
impression of the seal, which is that of your family, leads 
me to conjecture that you have had the goodness to send 
it. There are various important remarks and reflections 
in it which 1 believe to be just ; and there are others whose 
weight I cannot venture to estimate, without more thought 
and investigation than the state of my health admits of. 1 
will, however, take the liberty of suggesting a few hints on 
two of the topics. 
</p><p>
That the government of a State should have authority to 
appoint " particular days for rendering thanks to God" for 
any signal blessing, or imploring his assistance " in any public calamity," is certainly proper. But, can any of our governments be rightfully restrained from providing for the 
observance of the Sabbath, which the Sovereign of the universe has instituted, and which our Saviour has assured us 
" was made for man ?" 
</p><p>
Again — Can any government be justifiable in exempting 
murderers from the punishment of death, in opposition to 
the positive declaration of the Almighty to Noah, and 
through him to all his posterity, that " whosoever sheddeth 
man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed ;" not, I presume, at the discretion of private individuals, but under 
the cognizance and by the authority of government ? 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for this mark of friendly attention.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your friendly letter of the 27th ult. It gives me pleasure to reflect that our mutual esteem and 
regard have, from an early period, been constantly productive of cordiality and gratification. 
</p><p>
A kind <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> has extended our lives to the commencement of another year. Very few of our early a ciates remain with us. Our abode here is merely "pro hac vice," and our departure is then to place us in a suit'' of eternal good or evil. That good can only 1" ned by means of our merciful Redeemer, who was pleased to declare "without me, ye can do nothing." 
</p><p>
Although I have long been in a state of debility, yet it was lately so increased by an additional complaint, as caused me to delay preparing a few lines to you more seasonably.

That you and your family may always be blessed with 
beneficial prosperity, be assured, is the wish of my children, and also
