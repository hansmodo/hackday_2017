Dear John, 
</p><p>
Your letters of 26th Jan., 25th Feb., and 4th inst., are all before me. They are written with so much friendship 
and affection as to afford me great consolation, and convince me, notwithstanding my heavy losses, that in you I 
have more left than falls to the lot of most of my fellow mortals. May the blessing be continued to me, and I know how to value it. 
</p><p>
I sympathize most sincerely with you in your melancholy apprehensions about your parents. X know and I can feel 
such a loss ; but you draw your consolation from a never failing source, which will enable you to bear this misfortune whenever it shall happen, with that resignation to the will 
of Heaven which becomes one who is satisfied both of its wisdom and goodness. If we could shake off human frailty 
in the hour of affliction, we should certainly think it less reasonable to lament the death of a good man than to complain of the absence of a friend, who by that absence infinitely increases his happiness ; to wish them back is selfish 
and unworthy of true friendship, and yet we may, we must grieve when we arc not permitted to take leave. It is, I 
am sensible, a weakness, but I cannot help suffering myself to be afflicted at this circumstance. I know the pleasure that the best of fathers always took in my company 
and conversation ; and when I indulge the thought, I am unhappy that by my absence I lessened any of his enjoyments. 
But where am I running — God bless you — farewell. 
</p><p>
Your friend, 
</p><p>

Dear John,
</p><p>
I am much mortified at not hearing from you. I wrote 
to you last week, and am just now setting out for Bristol 
in order to meet Mrs. Livingston. I could wish to find 
Mrs. Jay there also. Pray send some of our colleagues 
along, otherwise I must be more confined than either my 
health or inclination will allow. You have doubtless seen 
the account brought by the Rifleman from London, by 
which it appears we shall have at least 34,000 commissioners. 
</p><p>
If your Congress have any spirit, they will at least build 
fourteen or fifteen light boats capable of carrying a twelve-pounder, to secure Hudson River, which is to be the chief 
scene of action. The carpenters employed on the frigate 
would build two or three a day, if they w r ere built in the 
manner of batteaux, which is the true construction. 
</p><p>
I wish you would direct Gaine to send me his paper. 
God bless you. 
</p><p>
Yours, most sincerely,

Dear John, 
</p><p>
I have just now heard that you are upon the point of 
leaving us. I might have expected to have received this 
intelligence from yourself, rather than from loose report, 
since there is scarce a transaction in the world in which I 
feel myself more interested. I rejoice at it as it advances 
your fortune and reputation. I lament it, as it adds to the 
losses I have already felt in the course of this war, that of 
a friend whom I had sense enough to value, even before 
age had ripened my judgment, and whom an after acquaintance with the world has taught me to think inestimable. I 
call it a loss, for I have but little prospect of seeing you 
here again. You will now move in a more enlarged 
sphere, and will hardly think of recrossing the Atlantic, till 
the blood runs too slowly in our veins to keep up the 
ardour of friendship. I was going- to give you a long 
detail of State politics, but they are now unworthy your 
attention. Besides that, I by no means feel myself disposed 
at this moment to view them in any other than the most contemptible light, or to execrate them for detaining me here, 
when I so ardently wish to receive your last adieu. When 
do you embark, and where 1 If from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, tell me when 
to meet you at <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>, and perhaps (if the Legislature adjourn) to accompany you. If this pleasure is denied me, 
believe that you and yours are attended by every tender 
wish which the sincerest friendship can dictate. I will not 
wrong you so much as to ask you to omit no occasion of 
lessening the pain I feel in your absence, by writing to me 
by every conveyance ; your own heart has and will for 
ever suggest that thought. Adieu, my dear John ; 
</p><p>
May you be as happy as I wish you,

Dear John, 
</p><p>
I received yours of the 23d May from Madrid, with 
duplicates thereof, and the letters you wrote from Cadiz 
and Martinique. 
</p><p>
Your remembrance of the pleasurable days of our 
youth, and the scenes in which we mutually bore our parts, 
together with the attractions which this country still has for 
you, afford me the most pleasing hope that neither time nor 
absence will weaken a friendship which has so long stood 
the test of both. This indeed I expected from the steadiness of your temper ; but I must confess that I had little 
hopes that your early return would afford me a prospect of 
deriving that consolation from it in the decline of life, to 
which I looked even while it directed the pursuits and animated the pleasures of youth. 
</p><p>
You mistake your own heart when you say you are unambitious : and without the assurance contained in your 
letter, I should have believed that the love of glory would 
have always kept you in the line in which you now are, 
more especially as the general satisfaction that your appointment and conduct since has given, renders it the wish of 
everybody less interested in your return than I am, to keep 
you abroad. 
</p><p>
I have not been able to procure at this place the key to 
the cipher that you directed me to, though I believe I have it 
at home ; besides that, it is very intricate and troublesome ; 
I shall therefore be obliged to confine what I have to say 
to mere common occurrences. I enclose you a cipher 
which is very simple, and not to be deciphered while the 
key is concealed, as the same figure represents a variety of 
letters. In order that you may know whether it comes 
safely to hand, I have in this letter used the precaution 
mentioned in yours. 
</p><p>
Nothing astonishes me more than the confidence with 
which the British ministry and their dependants assert, that 
America sighs to return to their government, since the fact 
is that we never were more determined in opposition, nor, 
if we except the derangement of our finances (which the 
loan of half a million would re-establish, if remitted in 
specie or merchandise), were we ever so capable of resistance. Our crops are uncommonly fine, and the militia of 
every State north and east of Delaware, is armed, disciplined, and inured to the duties of a camp. The southern 
militia are now at school, and I have no doubt will improve 
by the lessons they receive from the enemy. Our friend 
Smith, who has probably contributed to this ministerial 
madness, uninstructed by his repeated disappointments from 
the beginning of the war, is said to have advised Kniphausen to erect the royal standard in the Jerseys before 
General Clinton returned from <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, persuaded that 
our troops, and particularly the militia, would flock to it, 
and thus he have the honour of reducing the country, without sharing it with Clinton. He accordingly came over 
with great parade, with his whole force, scattering exaggerated accounts in printed handbills of the loss of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, 
which, instead of discouraging, only animated the militia. 
They were all in motion upon the first alarm, and though 
opposed only by them and less than a thousand continental 
troops, he was disgracefully driven out with the loss of 500 
men killed, wounded, and taken, after having penetrated 
ten miles from the shore, and done us no other injury than 
the burning of a few houses, and the abuse and murder of 
some women ; since which they have been more cautious 
and less sanguine. Adieu ; remember my compliments to 
the colonel and Mr. Carmichael. I am, dear John, 
</p><p>
Most sincerely yours,

Dear John, 
</p><p>
I am two letters in your debt, and am conscious that I 
shall make an ill return for them in offering you this product of a midnight hour, after a day spent in the fatigue of 
business and ceremony that our present situation exacts. 
But having just been informed by Mr. Piatt that he sails 
to-morrow morning, I cannot permit him to go, without 
offering you my congratulations on an event which you 
have so greatly contributed to bring about, the evacuation 
of tins city by the British on Tuesday last. 
</p><p>
Our enemies are hardly more astonished than we are 
ourselves, and than you will be when you hear that we 
have been five days in town without the smallest disturbance ; that the most obnoxious royalists that had sufficient 
confidence in our clemency to stay had not met with the 
least insult. Their shops were opened the day after we 
came in, and Rivington himself goes on as usual. The 
State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> Gazette is as well received as if he had 
never been printer to the king's most excellent majesty. 
So that your friends in Europe will find their apprehensions 
ill-founded, and that the race of tories will not, after all, be 
totally extinct in America. Perhaps, by good training and 
by crossing the breed frequently (as they are very tame), 
they may be rendered useful animals in a few generations. 
</p><p>
I thank you for your prints of the air-balls ; but wish to 
have some fuller account of their composition, and the use 
proposed to be made of them. As an architect, I cannot 
but be curious about the first castles in the air that promise 
to have some stable use. 
</p><p>
Receive my congratulations on the birth of your daughter, and make my compliments to Mrs. Jay on the occasion. 
</p><p>
I had hardly finished the last line, when I was alarmed 
by a very loud rumbling noise, accompanied by a quick 
tremulous motion of the earth. The family are too much 
alarmed to permit me to add more. Adieu.

Dear John, 
</p><p>
The quiet, which in my last I mentioned to have prevailed 
here, still continues with very few interruptions. Though 
the imprudence of the tories has, in some instances, given 
disgust to the warm whigs, particularly in a contest for the 
government of the church corporation, to the exclusion of 
those out of the lines, and in appointing Mr. Moore rector, 
in order to fill the church, a few days before we came in. 
The Legislature have interposed, and the government of the 
church is transferred to the whigs. 
</p><p>
Our parties are, first, the tories, who still hope for power, 
under the idea that the remembrance of the past should be 
lost, though they daily keep it up by their avowed attachment to Great Britain. Secondly, the violent whigs, who 
are for expelling all tories from the State, in hopes, by that 
means, to preserve the power in their own hands. The 
third are those who wish to suppress all violences, to soften 
the rigour of the laws against the royalists, and not to banish 
them from that social intercourse which may, by degrees, 
obliterate the remembrance of past misdeeds ; but who, at 
the same time, are not willing to shock the feelings of the 
virtuous citizens, that have at every expense and hazard 
fulfilled their duty, by at once destroying all distinction 
between them and the royalists, and giving the reins into 
the hands of the latter ; but who, at the same time, wish that 
this distinction should rather be found in the sentiments of the 
people, than marked out by the laws. You will judge to 
which of these parties the disqualifications contained in our 
election bill has given the representation, when I tell you that the members for this city and county are Lamb, Harper, Sears, Van Zandt, Mallone, Rutgers, Hughes, Stag, 
and Willet. I must, however, do all parties the justice to 
say, that they profess the highest respect for the laws, and 
that, if we except one or two persons, they have, as yet, by 
no act contradicted that profession. 
</p><p>
We are very angry here with Great Britain, on account 
of her West India restrictions (from which, by-the-bye, they 
suffer greatly), and are fulminating resolutions to prohibit 
all intercourse with her, which I think will probably be the 
case ere long. 
</p><p>
Thus have I given you a sketch of our politics, which 
will only be interesting to you if, as I sincerely hope, you 
mean to return soon to us. 
</p><p>
Politics has extended this letter to such an unreasonable 
length, that I dare not hazard a subject nearer my heart 
than either, but must, at this time, confine all its dictates to 
simple assurances of the firm and tender affection with 
which I am, and ever shall be, 
</p><p>
