Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a>, who will have the honour of delivering 
you this letter, is on his way to South Carolina, on a project 
w r hich I think, in the present situation of affairs there, is a 
very good one, and deserves every kind of support and 
encouragement. This is to raise two, three, or four battalions of negroes, with the assistance of the government of 
that State, by contributions from the owners, in proportion 
to the number they possess. If you should think proper to 
enter upon the subject with him, he will give you a detail 
of his plan. He wishes to have it recommended by Congress to the State ; and, as an inducement, that they would 
engage to take those battalions into continental pay. 
</p><p>
It appears to me that an expedient of this kind, in the 
present state of southern affairs, is the most rational that 
can be adopted, and promises very important advantages. 
Indeed, I hardly see how a sufficient force can be collected 
in that quarter without it ; and the enemy's operations there 
are growing infinitely serious and formidable. I have not 
the least doubt that the negroes will make very excellent 
soldiers with proper management; and I will venture to 
pronounce that they cannot be put into better hands than 
those of Mr. Laurens. He has all the zeal, intelligence, 
enterprise, and every other qualification necessity to succeed in such an undertaking. It is a maxim with some 
great military judges, that with sensible officers, soldiers 
can hardly be too stupid ; and, on this principle, it is thought 
that the Russians would make the best troops in the world, 
if they were under other officers than their own. The King 
of Prussia is among the number who maintain this doctrine, 
and has a very emphatical saying on the occasion, which I 
do not exactly recollect. I mention this, because I hear it 
frequently objected to the scheme of imbodying negroes, 
that they nre too stupid to make soldiers. This is so far 
from appearing to me a valid objection, that I think their 
want of cultivation (for their natural faculties are probably 
as good as ours), joined to that habit of subordination, which 
they acquire from a life of servitude, will make them sooner 
become soldiers than our white inhabitants. Let oificers 
be men of sense and sentiment, and the nearer the soldiers 
approach to machines, perhaps the better. 
</p><p>
I foresee that this project will have to combat much 
opposition from prejudice and self-interest. The contempt 
we have been taught to entertain for the blacks, makes us 
fancy many things that are founded neither in reason nor 
experience ; and an unwillingness to part with property of 
so valuable a kind, will furnish a thousand arguments to 
show the impracticability, or pernicious tendency, of a 
scheme which requires such a sacrifice. But it should be 
considered, that if we do not make use of them in this way, 
the enemy probably will ; and that the best way to counteract the temptations they will hold out, will be to offer 
them ourselves. An essential part of the plan is to give 
them their freedom with their muskets. This will secure 
their fidelity, animate their courage, and, I believe, will 
have a good influence upon those who remain, by opening a 
door to their emancipation. This circumstance, I confess, 
has no small weight in inducing me to wish the success of 
the project ; for the dictates of humanity and true policy 
equally interest me in favour of this unfortunate class of men. 
With the truest respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
I am, sir your most obedient servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Though I have not performed my promise of writing to 
you, which I made you when you left this country, yet I 
have not the less interested myself in your welfare and 
success. I have been witness with pleasure to every event 
which has had a tendency to advance you in the esteem of 
your country ; and I may assure you with sincerity that it 
is as high as you could possibly wish. All have united in 
the warmest approbation of your conduct. I cannot 
forbear telling you this, because my situation has given 
me access to the truth, and I gratify my friendship for you 
in communicating what cannot fail to gratify your sensibility. 
</p><p>
The peace, which exceeds in the goodness of its terms 
the expectations of the most sanguine, does the highest 
honour to those who made it. It is the more agreeable as 
the time was come when thinking men began to be seriously 
alarmed at the internal embarrassments and exhausted stair 
of this country. The New-England people talk of making 
you an animal fish-offering, as an acknowledgment of your 
exertions for the participation of the fisheries. 
</p><p>
We have now happily concluded the greal work of 
independence, but much remains to he done to reap the 
fruits of it. Our prospects are not fla Everyday proves the inefficacy of the present leration, ; el the common danger being removed, we are receding instead 
of advancing in a disposition to amend its defects. The 
road to popularity in each State is to inspire jealousies of 
the power of Congress, though nothing can be more apparent than that they have no power ; and that for the want 
of it, the resources of the country during the war could 
not be drawn out, and we at this moment experience all 
the mischiefs of a bankrupt and ruined credit. It is to be 
hoped that when prejudice and folly have run themselves 
out of breath, we may return to reason and correct our errors. 
</p><p>
After having served in the field during the war, I have 
been making a short apprenticeship in Congress ; but the 
evacuation of New-York approaching, I am preparing to 
take leave of public life, to enter into the practice of the 
law. Your country will continue to demand your services 
abroad. I beg you to present me most respectfully to Mrs. 
Jay, and to be assured of the affection and esteem of,

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I enclose you copies of two resolutions which have passed 
the House of Representatives of Virginia. Others had 
been proposed and disagreed to. But the war was still 
going on. A spirited remonstrance to Congress is talked of. 
</p><p>
This is the first symptom of a spirit which must either 
be killed, or will kill the constitution of the United States. 
I send the resolutions to you, that it may be considered 
what ought to be done. 
</p><p>
Ought not the collective weight of the different parts of 
the government to be employed in exploding the principles 
they contain ? This question arises out of sudden and undigested thought. 
</p><p>
I remain, dear sir, 
Your affectionate and obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">Alexander Hamilton</a>.

" Resolved, That it is the opinion of this committee, that 
so much of the act of Congress entitled 'An act making 
provision for the debt of the United States' as assumes the 
payment of the State debts, is repugnant to the constitution of the United States, as it goes to the exercise of a 
power not expressly granted to the general government. 
</p><p>
"Resolved, That so much of the act entitled 'An act 
making provision for the debt of the United States' as hinits 
the right of the United States in their redemption of the 
public debt is dangerous to the rights and subversive of the 
interests of the people, and demands the marked disapprobation of the General Assembly."

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The proceedings at <a href='/results.php?city=pittsburgh' rel='city'>Pittsburgh</a>, which you will find stated 
in the enclosed paper, and other incidents in the western parts of this State, announce so determined and persevering 
a spirit of opposition to the laws, as, in my opinion, to 
render a vigorous exertion of the powers of government 
indispensable. I have communicated this opinion to the 
president, and I doubt not his impressions will accord with 
it. In this case, one point for consideration will be the 
expediency of the next circuit court's noticing the state of 
things in that quarter, particularly the meeting at <a href='/results.php?city=pittsburgh' rel='city'>Pittsburgh</a>, 
and its proceedings. You will observe an avowed object 
is to " obstruct Reoperation of the law.*' This is attempted 
to be qualified by a pretence of doing it by "every legal 
measure." But "legal measures" " to obstruct the operation of a law," is a contradiction in terms. I therefore 
entertain no doubt, that a high misdemeanor has been committed. The point, however, is under submission to the 
attorney-general for his opinion. 
</p><p>
There is really, my dear sir, a crisis in the affairs of the 
country, which demands the most mature consideration of 
its best and wisest friends. 
</p><p>
I beg you to apply your most serious thoughts to it, and 
favour me, as soon as possible, with the result of your 
reflections. Perhaps it will not be amiss for you to converse with <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='colleague met'>Mr. King</a>. His judgment is sound. He has 
caution and energy. 
</p><p>
Would a proclamation from the president be advisable, 
stating the criminality of such proceedings, and warning all 
persons to abstain from them, as the laws will be strictly 
enforced against all offenders '. 
</p><p>
If the plot should thicken, and the application of force 
should appear to be unavoidable, will it be expedient for the 
president to repair in person to the scene of commotion ? 
</p><p>
These are some of the questions which present themselves. The subject will doubtless open itself in all its 
aspects to you. With real respect, and affectionate attachment, I remain, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your favours of the 26th November and 10th inst. have 
duly come to hand. I am ashamed that the former has 
remained so long unacknowledged; though I am persuaded 
my friends would readily excuse my delinquencies, could 
they appreciate my situation. 'Tis not the load of proper 
official business that alone engrosses me, though this would 
be enough to occupy any man. 'Tis not the extra attentions I am obliged to pay to the course of legislative manoeuvres, that alone adds to my burthen and perplexity. 
'Tis the malicious intrigues to stab me in the dark, against 
which 1 am too often obliged to guard myself, that distract 
and harass me to a point, which, rendering my situation 
scarcely tolerable, interferes with objects to which friendship and inclination would prompt me. 
</p><p>
I have not, however, been unmindful of the subject of 
your letters. Mr. Kino- will tell you the state the business 
was in. Nothing material has happened since. The representation will probably produce some effect, though not 
as great as ought to be expected. Some changes for the 
better, I trust, will take place. 
</p><p>
The success of the vice-president is as great a source of 
satisfaction, as that of Mr. Clinton would have been of mortification and pain to me. Willingly, however, would I 
relinquish my share of the command to the anti-federalists, 
if I thought they were to be trusted. But I have so many 
proofs of the contrary, as to make me dread the experiment 
of their preponderance. 
</p><p>
Very respectfully and affectionately, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
