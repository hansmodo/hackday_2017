Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
By a letter from Messrs. Gardoqui and Sons, of May 3d, received yesterday, I have the pleasure of knowing you 
were then well. In a postcript to one of his former of February 24th, the P. S. not dated, he says he hears of you 
every week. This creates a chagrin, as we have none of your favours later than March 3d. You are not to suppose 
that I dare to complain ; I have read my Bible to better purpose. I am not entitled to throw the " first stones," but I 
have as good a title as anybody to palliate my own faults, and to shift them upon others. There is said to be a committee 
of foreign affairs. Each member is loaded with a variety of business ; two have amiable wives near <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> ; I 
miss the gentlemen, therefore, frequently. <a href="/results.php?tla=rol" rel="colleague">Mr. Livingston</a> is now absent, but you have, herewith, a letter he sent to 
my care a few days ago. The weather is murderous hot, and I cannot go up and down to the offices, in search of 
those authenticated papers, which ought to be regularly forwarded to you, and other dignified officers abroad. You 
will be pleased therefore to know from me, individually, and by way of a resolve of Congress of June 21st, certified 
by me, that Mr. Dohrman, of Lisbon, is appointed our agent in Portugal. 
</p><p>
Mr. Searle is the bearer of this, via France, and <a href="/results.php?tla=jol" rel="colleague">Mr. Laurens</a> will either go for Holland in the same ship, the 
Jay, or will sail in a few days by another opportunity for Holland. The former gentleman is on business for the 
State of Pennsylvania, and, perhaps, for some mercantile companies also. You already know <a href="/results.php?tla=jol" rel="colleague">Mr. Laurens</a> is to 
negotiate a loan. Indeed, an instruction was given to a committee to bring in a draught of a letter to the ministers 
plenipotentiary of these States at Versailles and Madrid, directing them to inform his most Christian and Catholic 
Majesty of the appointment of <a href="/results.php?tla=jol" rel="colleague">Mr. Laurens</a>, and to solicit the aid of their majesties, respectively, on this occasion. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your friend 
</p><p>
And very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jal" rel="me">James Lovell</a>.
