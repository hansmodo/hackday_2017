My Dear Uncle : 
</p><p>
I arrived here the 7th inst,, and have since had the 
pleasure of conversing, at three different times, with 
Doctor Franklin. His accounts of America are, that 
she will be much better provided for, the ensuing 
campaign, than she was for the last ; that the members 
of the congress are as unanimous, as the members of 
popular assemblies generally are ; and that the spirit 
of the people does not, by any means, flag. It is a 
secret yet whether France will assist America or not. 
The fact, as it appears to me, is, that France does not 
choose to involve herself in a war by declaring herself 
openly, when she can give special succors without any 
risk. There are more French officers in America 
than can find employment ; the French ports are daily 
receiving American vessels. Some time ago, two 
armed vessels, one of which was loaded with military 
stores, were cleared out for St. Domingo, and a number 
of French officers took their passages in them. By 
some means or other, Lord Stormont discovered that 
these vessels were employed by Silas Deane, and the 
cargoes intended for America. He went immediately, 
at an unusual hour for business, to Versailles, and 
represented the matter to M. de Vergennes, minister 
and secretary for the foreign department; he had 
obtained an exact list of every thing on board ; said 
he had sufficient proof that the whole was designed 
for the rebellious English colonies; and demanded 
that these vessels should be stopped. The answer was 
that a courier should be dispatched ; a courier was 
dispatched, but the bird had flown. 
</p><p>
To-night, I take place in the diligence for Bordeaux, from whence I hope soon to embark for my own country. Cochran has sailed, which I am very 
sorry for, as my acquaintance with him, and the good character of his vessel, made me wish to be his passenger. 
</p><p>
Present my tenderest love to my dear aunt and sisters. I am afraid I shall not be able to write to 
my dear Patty. That God may grant you all his blessing, is the constant prayer of your most affectionate 
</p><p>
JOHN LAURENS.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
We moved to this place on the 10th hist. Here we received the account from Synnepuxent, and remain 
at fault till some more particular accounts of the motions of the enemy enable me to judge of their designs. 
In the meantime our soldiers are recruiting in a plentiful country, as well as strong drink and women will permit them. 
</p><p>
These impediments, however, to their laying in a stock of good health are not so general as might be expected in an army situated as ours is. 
</p><p>
The men are exercised in smaller or greater numbers 
every day. The country people bring in a plenty of 
vegetables, &c. and w r e hear very few complaints 
from those immediately about us of the violations of 
private property. We are all anxious to hear some 
thing that will give us employment of a different kind 
</p><p>
from that which we have at present. My best regards 
to all our friends, and I remain ever 
</p><p>

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
As we shall probably move to-morrow, I w r rite to 
inform you that I must be obliged to use your horses 
and servant farther on there having been no possibility of supplying myself with these articles here. 
Shrewsberry says his hat was violently taken from 
him by some soldiers, as he was carrying his horses 
to water. If James will be so good as to send him 
his old laced hat by the bearer, I hope he will take 
better care of it, 
</p><p>
If the enemy have a design upon Charles Town 
which does not so clearly appear to me as it does 
to most people, I hope we shall ruin the northern 
branch of their army, and that however they may 
for a while distress an individual state, their efforts 
against the general confederacy will be less likely to succeed than ever. I commend myself to your love and remain

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have just a minute to beg the favor of you to send my watch by Col. Tilghman : Messrs. Pinckney and Horry arriv'd here yesterday, but they could not 
inform me certainly whether you had employ'd Hunt to buy me a horse. I am exceedingly in want of a vigorous steed that can gallop and leap well, not 
younger than four, but I would rather have him of six or seven years of age. Your kindness will excuse my hurry and the trouble I give. The gentlemen 
above mention'd gave me pleasure in informing me that you were well. Col. Tilghman will answer any questions respecting the motions of the enemy and our own.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
Mr. Forsyth, the bearer of this, takes charge of 
four packets for you, two of which I received yesterday and two to-day. He has likewise two other 
packets for other members of Congress, one of them 
directed to your care. I have desired him in case of 
your removal from Reading to call on <a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='co-worker'>General Mifflin</a> 
who will have the letters forwarded. We shall move 
towards <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> to-day, as the weather is fair 
and our reinforcements are at some distance below, 
ready to fall in with us. Yesterday, the enemy 
halted at Chestnut Hill, not far from Germantown, 
and there was a cannonading heard in the morning 
down the river. I am your most affectionate

to be going in yesterday. After all my good intentions

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
In our present camp form'd of two commanding 
hills, whose front and flanks bid defiance to assailants, 
additionally secured by a very strong advanced post, 
and well supplied with every necessary, we wait the 
arrival of reinforcements from the north, a part of 
which is on its march and will soon arrive. What we 
are to do when reinforced depends upon circumstances. 
</p><p>
If our forts hold out and we do our duty, Gen'l Howe will find himself in a situation which will re 
quire the utmost exertions of military talents to bring 
him off with honor. He has already experienced 
some difficulty in subsisting his troops and Tory 
adherents; perhaps he might have been reduced to the 
necessity of retreating, if there had been proper concert in the proceedings of our fleet and garrison. 
The enemy's boats pass and repass at night, carry sup 
plies from the shipping to the town, and meet with 
no interruption. The cannon of the fort cannot be 
brought to bear upon them; random firing would be a 
waste of precious ammunition. The galleys alone can 
be opposed to their passage, which has been hitherto 
effected between Province Island and Fort Minim, 
under cover of darkness. What this inactivity of the 
galleys is owing to is unknown ; some attribute it to 
the jealousy which commonly subsists between the 
officers of the naval and land service a vitious spirit 
which should not be known in Republics. However 
I have reason to believe that this communication will 
be cut off for the future. 
</p><p>
The Reinforcements for this army are arrived at 
Red-bank the intended addition has been made 
to the two garrisons, and the remainder will be 
posted in a proper situation for falling on the rear of 
any storming party, or annoying the enemy in any 
more formal attack 011 Red-bank. This morning a 
heavy cannonading was heard from below and continued till afternoon ; from the top of Chew's house 
in German Town to which place the General took a 
ride this morning, we could discover nothing more 
than thick clouds of smoak, and the masts of two 
vessels, the weather being very hazy.

This days <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> paper contains Gen Burgoyne's Letter to's r AV m Howe : as I cannot send 
you the paper itself I copy the letter 
</p><p>
Copy of a Letter, $c., brought by Lieut. Valancy of the 62d. 
</p><p>
ALBANY, Octob. 20th. 
</p><p>
Sir: 
</p><p>
In conformity to my orders to proceed by the 
most vigorous exertions to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, I pass'd the 
Hudson's River at <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a> on the 13th September. 
</p><p>
No exertions have been left untried. The army 
under my command has fought twice against great 
</p><p>
superiority of numbers. The first action was on the 
19th Septem. when after four hours sharp conflict, 
we remain'd masters of the field of battle. The 2d 
action (on the 7th October) was not so successful and 
ended with a storm upon two parts of our intrenchments, the one defended by Lieut. Col. Breyman who 
was kill'd upon the spot, and the post was lost, the 
other defended by Lord Balcarras at the head of the 
British Light Infantry who repulsed the enemy with 
great loss. The army afterwards made good their 
retreat to the heights of <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, unable to proceed 
farther, the enemy having possession of all the fords 
and the passes on the east side of Hudson's River. 
The army waited the chances of events and ofFer'd 
themselves to the attack of the enemy till the 13th 
inst when only three days provision at short allowance remained. At that time the last hope of timely 
assistance being exhausted, my numbers reduced by 
past actions to three thousand five hundred fighting 
men, of which about nineteen hundred alone were 
British; invested by the enemys troops to the 
amount of sixteen thousand men ; I was induced by 
the general concurrence and advice of the General, 
Field officers and Captains commanding Corps, to 
open a Treaty with Major <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='co-worker'>Gen'l Gates</a>. Your 
Excellency will observe by the papers transmitted 
herewith, the disagreeable prospect that attended the 
first overtures, The army determined to die to a 
man, rather than submit to terms repugnant to 
national and personal honor. I trust you will think 
the Treaty inclosed consistent with both. 
</p><p>
I am with the greatest respect and attachment, 
</p><p>
Sir, &c., 
</p><p>
(Signed), J. BUHGOYNE.
</p><p>
The first overtures alluded to in the above letter. 
</p><p>
1st. <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>'s army being exceedingly 
reduced by repeated defeats, by desertion, sickness, 
&c., their provisions exhausted, their military stores, 
tents and baggage taken or destroyed, their retreat 
cut off and their camp invested, they can only be al 
lowed to surrender prisoners of war. 
</p><p>
Answer. Lieut. <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Burgoyne</a>'s army, however 
reduced, will never admit that their retreat is cut 
off, while they have arms in their hands. 
</p><p>
2. The officers and soldiers may keep the baggage 
belonging to them. The generals of the United 
States never permit individuals to be pillaged. 
</p><p>
3. The troops under his excell'y <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Burgoyne</a> will 
be conducted by the most convenient route to N". England, marching by easy marches, and sufficiently provided for by the way. 
</p><p>
4th. The officers will be admitted on parole, may 
wear their side arms, and will be treated with the 
liberality customary in Europe, so long as they by 
proper behaviour continue to deserve it ; but those 
who are apprehended having broke their parole (as some British officers have done) must expect to be closely confined. 
</p><p>
Answer. There being no officer in this army, under 
or capable of being under the description of breaking 
parole, this article needs no answer. 
</p><p>
5th. All public stores, artillery, arms, ammunition, carriages, horses, &ca., must be deliver'd to 
Commissaries appointed to recieve them. 
</p><p>
Answer. All public stores may be deliver'd arms excepted. 
</p><p>
6th. These terms being agreed to and sign d, the 
troops under His Excellys <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Burgoyne</a>s command 
may be drawn up in their encampment, where they 
will be order'd to ground their arms, and may be 
thereupon march'd to the river side, to be pass'd over 
in their way towards <a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a>. 
</p><p>
Answer. This article is inadmissible in any extremity ; sooner than this army will consent to ground 
their arms in their encampment, they will rush on the 
enemy determined to take no quarter. 
</p><p>
October 14th, <a href='/results.php?year=1777' rel="origin">1777</a>. 
</p><p>
These overtures being rejected the present Convention took place. 
</p><p>
In this paper are continued the proclamations on 
promising 200 Acres of Land to each non commisioned 
officer, and 50 to each private who shall serve in the 
Provincial Corps now raising the other marking 
the 1st day of December next as the last term of 
pardon for deserters from His Majesty's services. 
The most remarkable advertisements are " Wanted 
immediately an additional number of able bodied men, 
to serve on the city nightly parole, those desirous of 
serving are to apply to J. Delaplane Constable of the 
watch. "Wanted, a number of hands to cut wood 
during the winter season, for the use of the army 
good encouragement will be given &ca. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, Germantown and 
the country about are desired to make a return of 
the number of horses, waggons, teams and carts in 
their possession. 
</p><p>
Those that choose to hire their waggons by the day, 
shall be paid the customary price and those who 
conceal their waggons, and do not make returns as 
above, will have them seized. 
</p><p>
KB. A number of men wanted to drive waggons 
their pay shall be three shillings N. York Currency 
and provisions found them." 
</p><p>
The day before yesterday, Mr Crouch and another 
gentleman pass'd thro camp in their way from the 
eastward to Charles Town. They said they intended 
to continue their journey early the next morning. I 
was out till late dinner time with the General, was 
busy after dinner, and consequently had but little time 
for private affairs however, I accomplished a letter 
to M rs Laurens which I enclosed to Mr Gervais to be 
forwarded, giving him for his pains as much news as 
</p><p>
I could recollect and commit hastily to paper, and 
what will be a treasure to him as a Newsmonger, 
Humphrey's Gazette of the 25th . I expected to have 
been able to procure another for you, but have been 
disappointed. 
</p><p>
The light manner in which Count Donops affair is 
related.'s r W m Howe's Kitean harangue to such 
he would delude into the loyal corps of which he has 
reserved to himself the Colonelcy and other little 
anecdotes, may make it acceptable even a day or 
two hence, if you have not already seen it, and in 
that time I may get it from some one whose curiosity 
and that of his circle is satisfied or called off to some 
thing more recent. 
</p><p>
A day or two ago, Capt. Lee of the light horse with 
twelve of his troops, dispersed a foraging party on 
the other side Schuylkill, took a Captain of the 
Queen's Rangers (this is the name given to the new 
levies of provincial troops), and seven privates, two of 
whom were marines. He gives us intelligence that 
Gen'l Howe's first Aid de Camp is embarked for 
England and that his principal business is to solicit 
speedy and large reinforcements. This will be 
delivered to you by a Baron Frey, who brought a 
letter of recommendation from Doctor Franklin to 
the General, and is carrying one to Mr Morris. He 
left France in August, at which time he says it was 
the- serious opinion of people in France that the Court 
of G. Britain had obtained 30,000 Russians. 
Between copying and composing I have inked a 
great deal of paper, and it begins to be time for me to 
join in the concert of my snoring companions, who 
are extended before the fire in the style which we 
practiced in the interior parts of So. Carolina. I 
wish you as sound sleep with the cares of state as I 
am likely to have, and continue in every circumstance and situation my dear father.

</p><p>
I had the pleasure of writing to you yesterday by 
Col Morgan, and the day before by Baron Frey, a 
stranger lately arrived from France who is gone to 
offer his service to Congress. The cannonading 
heard day before yesterday was between the Somerset 
64 Gun Ship, the Roebuck and some other vessel on 
the one part, and our row-gallies seconded by a two 
gun battery on the other the affair was as follows : 
</p><p>
The above mentioned vessels advanced towards our 
chevaux de frise Gen'l Varnum had thrown up a 
fascine battery on a commanding piece of ground 
below Red-bank, and order'd an eighteen pounder 
and a twelve pounder to be moved into it. The 
eighteen pounder was overset in its way, which 
accident prevented its arrival before two o clock. In 
</p><p>
the intermediate time, however, the piece of twelve, 
was well employed the ships dropped down to the 
distance of a mile and a half from the battery, and 
the Somerset ran aground, in which situation she 
underwent a constant Fire from the Battery, which 
Gen'l Varnnm thinks must have injur'd her exceedingly. She made several signals of distress, upon 
which our Commodore with a great force advanced 
towards her and made a dreadful hut ineffectual 
roaring with his cannon the Roebuck, with the third 
vessel whose name I dont recollect and a galley, 
brought their bow guns to bear on our fleet and 
kept them at a respectful distance. The flood made, 
and the Somerset moved slowly off under cover of the 
other ships. She received farewell salutes from the 
battery as long as she continued within reach. 
</p><p>
Our anxiety had been raised in camp, by a report 
that a heavy firing of musquetry had been heard for a 
considerable time on the evening of the same day 
it turns out to be nothing more than a few single guns which Potter's militia and the enemy's detachment 011 Province Island make a practice of firing 
at each other without com 8 to any action. Four 
deserters from the enemy brought in this morning, say 
that the militia men call'd to the British soldiers and 
invited them to go over, promising them beef and 
flour the red-coats in return ask'd them to come 
and partake of their salt that from raillery they 
proceeded to abuse- and at length to discharging 
their pieces at each other, without any other effect as 
far as they know than wounding a Hessian yager. 
</p><p>
There have been several women from Ph a within 
two days past, who have applied for leave to pass into 
the country declaring that unless this indulgence 
be granted to them, they must inevitably starve. 
Our humane General says he will grant their request 
upon condition that they do not return into the city, 
and I believe directions are given for that purpose to 
the officers commanding sub-posts, who have hitherto 
stopt them. 
</p><p>
Rubenhaupt, the Dutch general who conducted the 
celebrated siege of Grave, shielded by national phlegm 
against any impression from female and infantine distress, rudely sent back into the town crowds of 
women and children, who presented themselves in his 
camp to entreat that he would deliver them from the 
horrors of famine by suffering them to pass his lines. 
</p><p>
The polite and gallant Prince of Conde, upon a 
similar application, when he was particularly called 
upon not to act inconsistently with the amiable 
characteristic of his countrymen the women of the 
besieged town who petitioned his leave to quit it, 
saying " they were persuaded a French Nobleman 
could not be so impolite as to reject the prayer of 
unfortunate ladies " dexterously parried this artful 
address to his feelings as a Frenchman, by replying 
that "he could not consent to deprive himself of the 
most desirable part of his conquest." 
</p><p>
I write this to go by James, who came to Head 
Quarters this morning to see me and take my commands. I happen'd to be out with the General when 
he arrived, and did not know of his being here till 
after dinner, which according to our late hour, made 
it near evening and as I had a second ride to take 
I detained him for the rest of the day. Mrs. Hartley 
is too far from camp for me to pay her my respects. 
If James returns that way, I will write her a note of 
thanks for her care of your letter of 26th Octob'r which 
I received yesterday. 
</p><p>
8th. His Excellency detains James in order to write 
by him to Congress I congratulate you, upon your 
succession to the Presidentship, tho we shall not 
know you in that capacity at Head Quarters till you 
are announced. 
</p><p>

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
Colonel du PortaiPs visit to Congress gives me an 
opportunity of relating some little transactions which 
serve by way of interlude to the grand acts of the 
military drama. Capt. Craig of Moylan's Light Dragoons, with sixteen horsemen surprised one of the 
enemy's patrols this morning, consisting of seven 
horse and seven grenadiers and took the whole party 
prisoners without a stroke on either side. The same 
officer informs us this afternoon from authority which 
he thinks good, that fifteen of the enemy's provision 
boats have fall n into our hands. 
</p><p>
We have received accounts from different persons 
that one of their floating batteries was sunk in launching. 
</p><p>
From the preparations made and every account 
obtained from deserters, spies, &c., we have reason to 
expect every day a pow rful attack on Fort Minim. 
</p><p>
General Yarnum has reinforced the garrison from 
his brigade, and such a disposition is made of our 
naval and land force in that quarter as will make a 
greater sacrifice the price of success, than I think Mr 
Howe in his present circumstances can afford. This 
evening, Capt. ^Nichols of the Eagle packet with the 
Cap't of an armed sloop, were brought to Head Quarters they were made prisoners by a detachment 
from Cap't Lee's troop, and as Nichols mentioned his being acquainted with some gentlemen of Carolina, 
Cap't Lee gave him a recommendatory letter to me. 
The honest seaman, tho he says his vessel was order'd 
to be in readiness for sailing at a moment's warning, 
seems to be affected by his misfortune and expresses 
as hearty rejoicing at the welfare of President Laurens as if he were a loyal subject to his master. lie 
says that Pond w T as on shore with him and narrowly 
escaped accompanying him hither. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to deduct from your pleasure by striking 
out the story of the provision boats. Upon reading 
Gen'l Varnum's letter of yesterday, I find mention of 
a convoy being driven back by our gallics ; the delay 
of their arrival has probably given room to conjecture 
in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> that they had been taken. 
</p><p>
10th. I have just return'd from an early walk to an 
eminence in front of the camp, where I had been 
listening to the tremendous, tho distant roaring of 
cannon. It is probable that this infernal noise is only 
a prelude to the more dangerous closer fight which 
has been so long meditated by the British and which 
both parties are prepared for. 
</p><p>
Will you be so kind as to tell me the orthography 
of galley, whether it be as already written, or thus 
gaily. 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
Since I had the pleasure of writing to you by 
Baron Frey, and the Chevalier du Portail, the siege 
of Fort Mifflin has been continued with great vigour and the new batteries open'd by the enemy on the 
10th have thrown their 24 and 32 pounders with 
great success. A considerable breach was made on 
the 11th in the masonry of the fort, many palisades 
were level d, the block houses almost ruin d, several 
cannon dismounted, and a valuable artillery officer 
kill d. In these circumstances the commanding officer Lieut. Col. Smith thought proper to consult with 
Brigadier Gen'l Varnum who is stationed at Woodberry near Fort Mercer on Red Bank, upon the 
propriety of evacuating the post. It was determined 
that the superfluous cannon, provisions and artillery 
stores should be removed and that a show of de 
fence should be kept up as long as possible. The 
commander in chief considering the importance of 
this place, which if it should fall into the enemy's 
hands would enable them to annoy our fleet and even 
drive it from the defence of the chevaux de frise, at 
first gave positive orders to maintain it at all events. 
These, however, were changed for discretionary orders 
in consequence of the great injury which the works 
had sustained. On the night of the 11th the enemy's 
fire interrupted the repairs of the fort. Three of their small vessels pass tl between Province Island and the fort to the mouth of the Sclmylkil. On the 
12th there was a great firing and two eighteen 
pounders dismounted. At night the enemy threw 
shells and the garrison was alarmed by thirty of their 
boats. On the 13th they open'd a new battery; our 
block houses were destroyed ; each day there were a 
few kill'd and wounded. The garrison exhausted by 
watching labour and ill health have been relieved. 
The enemy have not been tempted by the success of 
their batteries to storm a small number of men who 
maintained their ground in the ruins of the fort. 
I certainly think it practicable by nocturnal labours 
to complete a work which will bid defiance to storm, 
and cover the garrison from their 32 pounders. The 
engineer who is on the spot, Major Floury, a French 
man, will do every thing that can be done. His zeal 
and talents recommend him to public notice. To 
night the enemy have renewed their tiring. 
</p><p>
13th. Nothing like a storm yet from the detachment on Province Island. They content themselves 
with battering by day, and interrupting as much as they can our fatigue parties at night by firing from time to time in which the moonlight is serviceable to them. 
</p><p>
14th. Early this morning a floating battery armed with two heavy cannon was discover'd near the shore of Province Island. The new commandant at Fort 
Mifflin thinks the post tenable in spite of the enemy's land and water batteries. The Engineer Fleury says if lie is supplied from Red Bank with fascines, 
gabions, earth and fatigue-men, he will repair as much as possible each night the havoc made by day. 
What he will principally aim at will be the construction of some flanked work (shaped according to circumstances) which in case the block houses sh'd be 
irreparably lost, may enable the garrison to resist a storm. 
</p><p>
15. There has been firing in the course of the day 
and some scatter'd guns in the evening. 
</p><p>
16. Every account given by persons of different sexes 
and ages who have left <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> agrees in these 
points, that the inhabitants are exceedingly distressed 
for want of provision. Officers and soldiers humbled 
by the unexpected resistance of the forts, begin to 
express great anxiety on account of their present 
situation that our unhappy prisoners are treated 
with a barbarity which I think the Britons can only 
venture to be guilty of, because they persuade them 
selves the relation of it will not be believed in the 
present refined age. 
</p><p>
Gentlemen return'd from reconnoitering on the 
other side of Schuylkil say that the Continental flag 
was flying at Fort Mifnin yesterday evening, that the 
enemy by lightering a frigate of her guns had towed 
her through a shallow channel between Hog Island 
and Province Island. 
</p><p>
With this you will receive a <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> paper and a printed handbill which is one of a great number 
lately found in a chest at East Town. The direction 
of the chest is rubb'd off and there were no manuscripts within by which the owner could be discover d; 
each handbill was inscribed with the address which 
you see on this. Capt. Robinson calls for my letter. 
</p><p>
Adieu my dear Father. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">JOHN LAURENS</a>.
</p><p>
I had closed my letter persuaded that Fort Mifflin was still ours, when an officer from Red Bank enter'd with Gen'l Yarnum's dispatches. The enemy's fire 
yesterday was universal. Ships, batteries, land and water, one of the latter stationed near the fort threw 
in hand grenades our brave garrison suffer'd considerably some of our best officers wounded and Gen'l Yarnum, I suppose, ordered the fort to be 
evacuated last night. The fort has done infinitely more than was expected of it, and we must repair its loss.

</p><p>
My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
Your kind letter of the 12th , concluded on the 15th , has been deliver'd to me barely time enough to run it over. 
</p><p>
The express is to be sent back immediately with 
dispatches that were ready, so that I shall have but 
few moments allowed me for writing to you. The 
little innovation in the epithet applied to Gen'l Howe's 
oration, I took the liberty of forming from Kite, a 
character in the comedy of the Recruiting Officer, 
and meant to draw a parallel between the sergeant's 
harangue and that of the General but upon recollection I believe I have done the former an injustice 
who confined his promises to more practicable things. 
I shall not now have time to give you my dear Father 
a particular account of the progress of the besiegers 
and persevering defence of our brave garrison, to the 
time when perpetual hail of musquetry and hand 
grenades from the round tops of the Empress of 
Russia, an East Indiaman cut down and converted 
into a floating battery of 18 twenty-four pounders, 
made it impossible for men to do any thing more in 
the fort than sacrifice themselves unrevenged. I hate 
to blame without sure grounds ; but as far as I can 
judge at this distance, the naval department has been 
deficient in its duty. The Commodore is brave, but 
has no command. The questions now are can we 
prevent the enemy's raising the chevaux de frise by 
keeping possession of Red Bank or Fort Mercer if 
the enemy should effect a lodgment on Mud Island 
can our fleet maintain its present position ? Is it not 
possible to take the Empress of Russia, and sink an obstruction in the channel thro which she pass'd ? I say 
yes to them all, except the second and the enemy's lodgm' may be prevented. 
</p><p>
You, my dear father will call me a presumptuous young man, especially when you hear that three general officers are gone to investigate these points on the 
spot. Pardon the manner of my letter, in consideration that I have been endeavouring to satisfy the problem which requires the most written in the least given 
time. Chagrined at the necessity of taking leave so abruptly, I console myself with the prospect of writing more deliberately in a day or two. 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate 
</p><p>

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
Mr Boudinot, commissary of prisoners informs me 
that he intends for York to morrow, and if I understand 
him right, wishes that I would give him a letter of 
introduction to you. He is a sensible man and attentive to the duties of his office. 
</p><p>
Your kind letter of the 23 d announces a very accept 
able reinforcement of linnen for which I am exceedingly obliged to you the boots will come in good 
time those which I wear at present are in good 
condition, but where they undergo such hard duty as 
they do in the service of an aide de camp, a relief is 
necessary. The gloves are not so indispensible, I 
have discover'd an old pair which have been washed 
and serve me with reparation ; the woolen ones 
however will be an exceeding good reserve. 
</p><p>
I believe your question relative to the proceedings 
of the enemy since the evacuation of Fort Mimin, 
has been answered in one of my former letters. 
</p><p>
Troops from Province Island immediately possess'd 
themselves of the ruin'd wall and palisades, and threw 
up a battery. At the evacuation of Fort Mercer a 
quantity of powder was fired with intention to blow 
up the magazine and ruin the works however, it had 
but little effect, and the destruction was completed by 
the enemy. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Greene</a> had prepared to give L'd Cornwallis 
battle, when he was call'd oft by a grand scheme 
which was in agitation the day before yesterday. An 
attack was meditated on the enemy's lines ; a proper 
disposition was plann'd for attacking their redoubts 
vigorously in front, while Greene's detachment embark'd in boats should fall down the river land in the 
city and charge the enemy in their rear. A cannonade from an eminence on the west side of Schuylkil 
was to second these attacks and Potter's Militia were 
to make a show at the bridge. Some were clearly 
for it and some clearly against it ; both parties ignorant 
at the same time of the strength of the works. Our 
Commander in chief wishing ardently to gratify the 
public expectation by making an attack upon the 
enemy yet preferring at the same time a loss of 
popularity to engaging in an enterprise which he could not justify to his own conscience and the more respect 
able part of his constituents, went yesterday to view 
the works. A clear sunshine favoured our observations : we saw redoubts of a very respectable profit, 
faced with plank, formidably fraised, and the intervals between them closed with an abbatis unusually 
strong. General du Portail declared that in such 
works with five thousand men he would bid defiance 
to any force that should be brought against him. I 
was led into all the history which I must beg my dear 
father may be very discreet but now no secret 
however my friends in Carolina may talk of things 
they know without quotation I know my few friends 
there are also discreet, between ourselves in order 
to account for <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Greene</a>'s not marching to L'd Cornwallis as every man of experience and judgment, 
thinks it would be madness with our force to make an 
attempt on the enemy in their present situation. 
</p><p>
It follows that in order to guard against L'd Cornwallis's being suddenly recall d, and the enemy's 
marching with their whole force against our army, 
weakened by a considerable detachment, we should 
withdraw <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Greene</a> from the Jerseys and a 
courier has been accordingly dispatched for that 
purpose. When the junction is form'd we shall 
probably march to some place where the troops may 
be cover'd from the inclemency of the season, and be 
within distance for annoying the enemy's shipping 
and cutting ofT any detachments which they may 
have occasion to make. A position on the other side 
of Schuylkil would unite these two advantages and 
have the additional ones of being in a more plentiful 
country for forage, &ca., and reducing the enemy to 
the passage of a bridge in case they should attempt a 
sudden attack upon us. German Town would cover 
a great many troops, but it would require strong works 
to secure it, and is within surprising distance. 
</p><p>
I was going to speak privately of several public 
matters, but the horses are order d, and what I write 
must be dispatched hastily. The promotion of Col. "Wilkinson to the rank of Brigad'r General has given 
universal disgust in the corps of Continental officers. 
If he had signalized himself, say many of them, by 
any remarkable service, we should have applauded 
Congress for bestowing a well merited reward; but 
we think there is a degradation of rank and an injustice done to senior and more distinguished officers, 
when a man is so extraordinarily advanced for riding 
post with good news. Let Congress reward him with 
a good horse for his speed, but consecrate rank to 
merit of another kind. 
</p><p>
This matter is likely to produce many resignations 
in the line of colonels. Rank has likewise been 
vilified by the indiscriminate distribution of it. Waggon masters, regimental quarter masters, &ca., have 
had titles which cease to be honorable when possessed 
by such personages. 
</p><p>
I had some other things to say but I believe I shall be better employed for the present in sending 
you such extracts as I shall have time to cull from the 
last <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> paper. I give you the paragraphs 
quoted from the English papers first because I am sure 
they will amuse you. 
</p><p>
The great outline of the intended operations is 
said to be this. If France does not absolutely relinquish her present treacherous conduct, which gives 
her all the advantages of a war without any of the 
dangers and losses to declare war against her; 
to send 50,000 foreign troops to America, which are 
actually agreed for; to call home the frigates and 
let them loose on the French commerce, and to form 
a grand expedition with Gen'l Howe's army against 
the W. India Islands; to cede Gibralter and a sugar 
island to Russia, on condition of the Empress send"ing 40,000 men to North America. What seems to 
confirm these circumstances is a commission going 
to Holland to engage transports. 
</p><p>
[The above appear'd in the London papers, a few 
days before the court of France had order'd the rebel 
vessels out of their ports, and prohibited the sale of 
their prizes.] 
</p><p>
PHILADELPHIA. 
</p><p>
" Last Thursday afternoon the rebels at Red-bank, 
horribly panick struck with the loss of their fort at 
Mud Island, which they looked upon as inaccessible 
and indeed was ama/ingly strong blew up their 
magazine and fled from their fortifications which, they 
had been preparing for these six or seven weeks past, 
with all the speed they were masters of, depending 
intirely on the nimbleness of their heels for their 
safety, and were heard by many of the citizens who 
were on the wharves looking at the vessels on fire, 
to cry with the greatest vociferation, Damn you 
drive on drive on run my boys the English are 
coming. 
</p><p>
" The same evening the brave commander of their 
fleet deserted by these their gallant comrades, set fire 
to two of their vessels, and sent them towards the city 
with the flood tide, but not having heart to put in 
execution their mischievous designs, quitted them 
before they reached the town when they drifted on 
the Jersey shore and were burnt. Early the next 
morning with the first of the flood, they would fain 
have stolen by the city with the rest of the fleet, and 
for this purpose sent their galleys on first, which were 
so warmly saluted by the different batteries along shore 
and by the Delaware frigate, that it induced them 
rather to trust terra-firma than their floating fortresses 
for the security of their persons, and setting fire 
to their ships, kebecs, brigs, schooners, sloops, &ca., 
abandoned them leaving their rigging, sails and 
every thing else on board, to the mercy of the flames, 
which burnt with such rapidity that it was impossible 
to save any part. Some of the vessels drove opposite 
to the town, where the fire reaching the guns which 
</p><p>
wore loaded, they went off, and shortly after their 
magazines blew up with great explosions, but happily did no damage. In the conflagration, eight or 
nine topsail vessels were consumed. Thus was a fleet 
that cost the Congress and this province some hundred 
thousand pounds, to their burning shame destroyed 
in a few hours. 
</p><p>
" It is with the greatest satisfaction the printer con 
gratulates his fellow citizens upon the happy fulfilment 
of his hopes express'd in one of his former papers, 
that we sh'd shortly have the fleet lying before this 
city and upon the happy renewal of business. 
Nothing can afford every well- wisher to the prosperity 
of this province greater joy than the present pleasing 
view of our wharfs crowded with vessels and merchandise of every kind. 
</p><p>
" Saturday morning last about 7 o clock a pretty 
smart shock of an earthquake was felt in this city. 
It is about 14 years since any thing of an earthquake 
has been felt here before. 
</p><p>
" "Whereas, notwithstanding the general agreement 
of the inhabitants of this city That such legal paper 
money as has been emitted by acts of assembly, and 
received the royal sanction, should be received in all 
payments, and deemed of equal value with gold and 
silver at the old customary rates, in the said agreement specified sundry persons lately arrived in this 
city, and even some who have signed the said agreement, do now refuse to take the said paper money 
and make a difference in the prices if they can be paid 
in gold and silver thereby taking an injust advantage of the necessity of the times, striving to embarrass 
the public affairs, to destroy the chief medium of 
our commerce and prevent the negotiating bills of 
exchange. "We therefore to discourage practices so 
selfish and injurious to the public, do hereby engage to 
each other and the public upon our honor that we 
will not directly or indirectly deal with any person or 
persons whatsoever who shall refuse to take the said 
paper money in their payments, or make any difference 
between the value thereof and gold and silver as fixed 
in the said agreement nor will we deal with any 
person or persons who shall be known to engross any 
quantity of provisions, with a view to retail the same 
at an immoderate price to the distress of the poor and 
industrious housekeepers. The above association is 
now signing by the Inhabitants at the Coffee House. 
</p><p>
AYe have just received intelligence from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Greene</a> and the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De La Fayette</a> that Morgan's

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have just received and hastily read over your kind 
letter of the 27th and could write a great deal in answer 
to it if time or discretion would permit. This will 
merely serve as a cover to a newspaper, part of which 
I copied in my last. It goes by a man who is to set 
off immediately for York as I am informed by Col. Tilghman. I am exceedingly obliged to you for the 
</p><p>
gloves, and am ever 
</p><p>
Your affectionate 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">JOHN LAURENS</a>.
</p><p>
I must detain the messenger, who ever he be, while 
I relate an anecdote, which will give you some idea 
of the general misbehaviour of our navy. 
</p><p>
When their retreat up the river was expected, the 
Delaware frigate was given over for lost her guns 
were taken out, and only a few men left in her who 
were to make their escape immediately upon an attack 
from our fleet which was looked upon as an event that 
would certainly happen and that could not be other 
wise than successful on our side. 
</p><p>
If it were the custom for generals to proclaim their 
intentions, we had a right to expect an attack to-day ; 
however, it is not amiss to he prepared for it. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Greene</a> has joined us, and our forces are reunited. 
The enemy after razing Bilingsport and Red Bank 
have quitted the Jerseys altogether. It appears that 
two British captains were kill'd and two wounded in 
the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De La Fayette</a>'s combat. 
</p><p>
Upon looking into your letter again I see that I am 
indebted to a lady for the gloves; you will oblige me 
by saying something handsome for me. My letter 
alluded to, began in the manner which you describe ; 
it was a kind of journal which I had begun, and laid 
by in order to add to it occasionally.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I thank you for your kind letter of the 30th of last 
month, and the American Code of Public Law. I 
have given this book not such a reading as I wished, 
but such as my time permitted, and think it contains 
all the fundamental laws of a federative republic. 
</p><p>
It is the part of the wise legislative body to make 
the union of the states perpetual by procuring it the 
sanction of popular opinion. 
</p><p>
If the majority of the people in each state, or only 
the majority of the states, can he persuaded that it is 
a religious duty, as was the case of the Greeks with 
respect to the Amphictionic League, or a duty to 
themselves as most favouring their private and 
political interests to maintain the confederation, it 
will he established upon the most permanent basis 
that human affairs admit of, and the opinion propagated by education will pass to remote posterity. I 
shall study these laws with the greatest attention in my retirement. 
</p><p>
We have received several accounts from outposts 
within a few days past intimating that an attack upon 
us was meditated. We have in consequence prepared 
ourselves, paraded our men so as to make them 
acquainted with their ground and its advantages ; but 
the enemy have remained within their works. Many 
are of opinion that's r W m Howe will not sutler any 
thing but mere necessity, or a very tempting prospect 
of decisive success, to call him from good winter 
quarters. Others say that from past experience lie 
knows the vicinity of the Continental army to be 
exceedingly troublesome, and that it is his interest to 
drive us to a more respectable distance. In the mean 
time the season advances in which armies in General are forced to repair to more substantial shelter than 
tents, and whose inclemency is more particularly 
grievous to our ill-clothed soldiers. The question is 
whether we are to go into remote winter quarters, 
and form a chain of cantonments in the interior part 
of the country ; leaving a vast extent of territory ex 
posed to the devastation of an enraged unsparing 
enemy ; leaving inhabitants who will be partly seduced 
by the expectation of gold, or more generally compell'd 
to fill the traitorous provincial corps now raising; 
leaving plentiful granaries and large stocks of cattle, 
ample means for subsisting the troops and Tory citizens in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and for victualling transports 
that may carry home Mr Burgoyne and his army; 
leaving the well affected to fall a sacrifice, and deplore 
our abandonment of them and the country; or, 
whether we shall take a position more honourable, more 
military, more republican, more consonant to the 
popular wish in a proper situation for covering the 
country, or at least so much of it as circumstances will 
permit and for distressing and annoying the Enemy ? 
</p><p>
Winter campaigns it is said are ominous to the best 
appointed and best disciplined armies. The misery 
incident to them occasions desertion and sickness 
which waste their numbers. Our army in particular 
requires exemption from fatigue in order to compensate for their want of clothing. 
</p><p>
Relaxation from the duties of a campaign, in order 
to allow them an opportunity of being disciplined and 
instructed ; warm quarters, that it may appear in the 
spring with undiminished numbers and in the full 
</p><p>
prowess of health, &ca. Besides it is urged that the 
hardships which our soldiers undergo discourage men 
from enlisting. The answers that might be given in 
our particular circumstances to these general objections against winter campaigns are only for your 
private ear, and not to be trusted in a letter to the possibility of miscarriage ; besides, we may take a position 
which will not absolutely expose us to a winter 
campaign, but furnish us excellent quarters for men 
at the same time that it leaves us within distance for 
taking considerable advantages of the enemy, and 
cover a valuable and extensive country. 
</p><p>
As I hear that the Chevalier Failly intends for York, 
and it seems to be a matter of doubt whether any 
dispatches will go from head quarters to-day, I ll 
finish my letter and send it by him. 
</p><p>
Gen'l Dickinson made a descent some days ago on 
Staten Island which, if lie had not been betrayed, 
would have thrown into his hands some very valuable 
prisoners and a large number of common ones. As it 
was, he took 2 lieutenants and 25 privates ; made a 
secure retreat, and lost only two or three kill'd and 
wounded. 
</p><p>
The triumviral committee from Congress arrived this evening. As much as I desire to see you, my dear father, I fear an interview cannot be effected for 
some time to come. Col. Hamilton who was sent to the Northern army to explain the necessity for reinforcements from thence, lies dangerously ill on the 
road. Since the battle of German Town, I have no longer been a supernumerary. 
</p><p>
My heart is ever with you,

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have barely time to thank you for your packet of 
the 12th , and to express my great concern at the cause 
of your confinement. The pain arising from your 
malady must be aggravated by its happening at a time 
when you have the most important public affairs on 
your mind ; but I hope it will neither be so durable 
nor so grievous as you seem to expect. Your own 
philosophy and the assurance of the sympathy of your 
friends will greatly mitigate the evil. I return two 
of the letters which you sent me, for your perusal; 
the others were from M w Laurens; the last dated gives 
me a title to expect her arrival in Carolina in company with Mr Blake's family. 
</p><p>
The army cross'd the Schuylkil on the 13th and has 
remained encamped on the heights on this side. Our 
truly republican general has declared to his officers 
that he will set the example of passing the winter in 
</p><p>
a hut himself. The precise position is not as yet 
fixed upon, in which our huts arc to be constructed ; 
it will probably be determined this day; it must 
be in such a situation as to admit of a bridge of communication over the Schuylkil for the protection of 
the country we have just left; far enough from the 
enemy not to be reached in a day's march, and properly interposed between the enemy and the most 
valuable part of this country on this side Schuylkil. 
With anxious prayers for your recovery, 
</p><p>
I am your most dutiful and affectionate 
</p><p>

Berry received a hunting shirt and a check shirt. If there be any difficulty in getting him winter clothes I believe he can do without. 
</p><p>
The last plundering and foraging party of the enemy under L'd Cornwallis on this side Schuylkil have 
gone beyond themselves in barbarous treatment of the inhabitants.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I wish it were in my power to enter properly into the different subjects which compose your letter of the 20th . In my present circumstances I must content 
myself with writing you a short and hasty epistle. The particulars of the aifair alluded to by the Chevalier de Failly, I took it for granted you would have 
received in your official letter, and therefore regretted the less my want of time to inform you properly of it. 
The matter was in brief as follows : when we march'd from WMtemarah Camp, and were in the act of crossing the Schuylkil, we received intelligence that the 
enemy were advancing on this side of the river; infact a ravaging party of four thousand under the command of Lord Cornwallis had pass'd the river and 
were driving Potter's Militia before them. Two regiments of this corps, however, are said to have conducted 
themselves extremely well and to have given the enemy no small annoyance as they advanced. <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>General Sullivan</a> was Major Gen'l of the day and consequently conducted the march. 
</p><p>
His division and part of Wayne's had cross'd the river; being uncertain as to the number of the enemy, and dreading their advance in force. When 
part of the army should be on one side of the river and part on the other he order'd those troops to recross and our bridge to be render'd impassible. 
</p><p>
Notice of this was sent to the Commander in Chief, 
and when he arrived parties of the enemy were seen 
on the commanding heights on this side of the river. 
There was a pause for some time and consultation what 
was to be done; parties of horse in the mean time 
were detached to gain certain intelligence of the enemy's number and designs. 
</p><p>
It was considered that our army was near a river 
to which it had march'd by a narrow road, on each 
side of which thick woods render'd it impossible for the army to display itself; and that if sir Wm Howe sh'd 
keep up a show on the opposite side Schuylkil, and at 
the same time march in force from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> upon 
us, we must in these circumstances inevitably be 
ruined. Some pronounced hastily that the enemy had 
received intelligence of our march, although the resolution had been taken in council only the night before, 
and that they were prepared to oppose our passage. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>Gen'l Washington</a> who never since I have been in his 
family has pass'd a false judgment on such points, 
gave it as his opinion that the party in view were 
foragers ; that the meeting was accidental, but, how 
ever, the enemy might avail themselves of this unexpected discovery, and might draw as much advantage 
from it as if the rencounter had been premeditated. 
</p><p>
The intelligence was received that the enemy were 
retiring in great haste, but it did not appear satisfactory, 
and the army was ordered to march to the Swedes 
Ford three or four miles higher up the river and 
encamp with the right to the Schuylkil. The next 
morning the want of provisions I could weep tears of 
blood when I say it the want of provisions render'd it 
impossible to march. We did not march till the evening of that day. Our ancient bridge, an infamous 
construction which in many parts obliged the men to 
march by Indian file, was restored, and a bridge of waggons made over the Swedes Ford, but fence-rails 
from necessity being substituted to plank, and furnishing a very unstable footing, this last served to cross a 
trifling number of troops. As the event turn'd out <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a>'s retrograde movement was unspeakably 
unlucky. If we had persevered in crossing in the 
first instance, or if we had even crossed in the evening 
of the first day, the flower of the British army must 
have fallen a sacrifice to superior numbers. 
</p><p>
Among the parties of horse that were out upon this 
occasion a small detachment of Bland's Regiment 
composed of trumpeter, farrier, and whatever could 
be collected for the moment, their Col. at their head, 
charged a serjeant and guard of Hessians and took 
them all prisoners. 
</p><p>
On the 19th inst. we march'd from the Gulph to this 
camp, head quarters at the Valley forge. 
</p><p>
On the 22 nd at night we received intelligence of a 
large foraging party of the enemy having pass'd the 
Schuylkil. Last evening the 22 d Gen'l Potter wrote us 
that General Howe is with the foragers, from whence 
we conclude that the greatest part of his army is with 
him. They encamped on the other side of Derby 
last night will you believe it starving in a plentiful country. The utmost we could do was to dispatch 
small parties draughted from each brigade last night, and to take extraordinary means for furnishing the army with provisions to enable a more respectable force to inarch to the enemy. L'd Stirling's Division 
march cl to-day in order to cover the country and observe the enemy's motions till something more effectual can be done. 
</p><p>
I have inquired whence this defect in the Commissariat Department arises; but this must be defer'd 
till I next have the pleasure of writing to you. I have 
barely time to repeat my prayers for your speedy recovery, and the assurances of the boundless love of your

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I am much disappointed in being obliged to write 
you a short and hasty letter, and sorry to send you 
only the translation of one of your French pieces. 
Col. Barton, who brought me your letter of the 25th , 
made me happy by informing me that you were in a 
fair way of recovery; in that of the 23 d that you had 
recourse to your old experiment of cold water. Gen'l M'Intosh had told me that you were trying the effects 
of this uncommon application, and it made me uneasy; 
but I cannot help applauding it as it has succeeded. 
</p><p>
Inclosed is a letter from Holland, and one from M ra 
Manning, to which the former served as cover. The 
blunder of our friend is unaccountable, but I am in 
hopes it will not be attended with the pernicious consequence which you seem to apprehend, as it will not 
be easy to ascertain or take hold of the property which 
you may have in private hands against the will of 
the party holding it. Capt Nichols is not yet returned 
from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> ; I have sent a message to him by 
the deputy Com y of prisoners who went in to-day, 
and I have no doubt that the Capt. will wait upon you 
if he conies out again. 
</p><p>
Gen'l Smallwood who commands a division posted 
at Wilmington, has given us information that upon 
hearing of an armed brig being aground five miles 
above his post, he detached a strong party with two 
field pieces to take her. The Capt. of the brig upon 
the first summons refused to surrender, thinking the 
party was armed only with musquetry and prepared 
for defending himself; but being undeceived by 
two or three cannon shot, he struck. The prisoners 
taken on board of her are a British captain of foot, 
67 privates, the master of the brig, 12 seamen and 
about 40 women, some of whom are officers wives. 
The cargo is said to consist of clothing for soldiers, 
some arms and ammunition, some liquors, officers 
baggage and camp equipage; however, we do not 
know exactly. The captain of foot was too sulky 
to be communicative, and the master says the contents of the bales are unknown to him. The brig is 
armed with six four pounders and a few swivels. A 
sloop laden with pork, flour, &ca., for the <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> 
market is likewise taken and will be either burnt or 
secured as circumstances will permit. 
</p><p>
The enemy returned to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> last Sunday 
after having completed their forage, without any other 
inconvenience than a small balance of prisoners against 
them. It seems they had been necessitated to come 
out by having imprudently packed their former plunder 
of hay before it was thoroughly dry, by which means 
the greatest part was damaged and they were reduced 
to four days allowance in this article. 
</p><p>
The soldiers are nearly covered with good huts. The North Carolinians are the most backward in their 
buildings, and for want of sufficient energy to exert themselves once for all, will be exposed to lasting evils. 
</p><p>
The promotion of Gen'l Conway has given almost universal disgust. His military knowledge and experience may fit him for the office of inspector genera], 
but the right of seniority violated, without any remark able services done to justify it, has given a deep wound to the line of brigadiers. 
</p><p>
It is said that the influence of a certain general officer at Reading is productive of great mischief. 
When Gen'l Conway went from camp he gave out that 
he meant to return to France, his countrymen under 
stood the manoeuvre ; it has succeeded to his wish, 
and I believe now he is exceedingly indiffirent whether 
he acts Insp r Gen'l or no. I am rather inclined to think 
that he prefers returning with his splendid titles to 
France, where he hopes to obtain a lucrative and 
peaceful office in the service of the states. 
</p><p>
I devoutly pray that many new years of happiness 
may be added to your life.

Your most affectionate

The Chevalier du Plessis who commanded the 
artillery and acted as engineer at Fort Mercer has 
obtained a promise from his Excellency, to write in 
his behalf to Congress in order that his merit may be 
rewarded by promotion as from the improvements 
which he made at Fort Mercer and his gallant conduct 
when Count Donop was repulsed, he deserves well of 
the United States ; if the general should recommend 
him in consequence of his promise, which I suppose 
he will do whenever his time permits, I would solicit 
that the reasons for the Chevalier's promotion may be 
express'd in the resolve of Congress, which will be of 
great service to him in France.

</p><p>
My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
By this day's courier, you will be informed of a base insult offer'd to the Commander in chief, which will raise your indignation. 
</p><p>
A preliminary anecdote may throw some light upon 
this matter. Some time ago, his Exc y received a letter 
from a friend, enclosing a piece of paper with the following words : " In a letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='co-worker'>Gen'l Gates</a>, Gen'l Conway says, Heaven has been determined to save your 
country, or a weak general and bad counsellors would 
have ruined it. The Gen'l immediately copied the 
contents of the paper, introducing them with sir, and 
concluding with, I am your humble serv 4 , and sent 
this copy in form of a letter to Gen'l Conway." This 
drew an answer, in which he first attempts to deny the 
fact, and then in a most shameless manner, to explain 
away the word weakness. The perplexity of his style, 
and evident insincerity of his compliments, betray his 
real sentiments, and expose his guilt. 
</p><p>
After this, he certainly had no right to expect cordiality on the part of the general, but he has always 
been treated with that kind of civility, which resulted 
from a consideration of his public character, abstracted 
from his private one. He experienced that kind of complaisance, which passes current in the transactions of 
men, and in which the heart is not concerned. Indeed 
you will think, perhaps, the General's delicacy on this 
point led him to too great forbearance when you learn 
that Gen'l Conway was charged with cowardice at the 
battle of German Town, and that a gentleman of rank 
and reputation, desir'd to be called upon as an evidence. It is notorious that he disobey'd his orders, 
and that he was fora considerable time separated from 
his brigade. The Gen'l , however, thinking that a pub 
lic investigation of this matter set on foot by him, 
might be attribut'd to motives of personal resentment, 
suffer'd it to pass over. When Gen'l C. left camp, pre 
tending that he was determined to return to France, 
his countrymen discerned his real intentions, and gave 
him credit for the manoeuvre. 
</p><p>
He has weight it seems with a certain party, formed 
against the present Commander in chief, at the head 
of which is Gen'l Minim. His own preposterous panegyricks of himself, and the influence of this junto, have 
probably gained him the extraordinary promotion, 
which has convulsed the army. His reception at camp 
was consonant to the Gem" 8 uniform conduct towards 
him, since the epoch above alluded to ; the complaisance due to his rank was exercised towards him. 
</p><p>
What has passed since, you will be properly informed 
of. His last letter, which is a most insolent attempt 
at what the French call persiflage, or humouring a man, 
affects the Gen'l very sensibly. 
</p><p>
It is such an affront as Conway would never have dared to offer, if the General's situation had not assured him of the impossibility of its being revenged in a 
private way. The Gen'l , therefore, has determined to return him no answer at all, but to lay the whole matter before Congress ; they will determine whether Gen'l W. is to be sacrificed to Gen'l C., for the former can never consent to be concerned in any transaction with 
the latter, from whom he has received such uupadonable insults. My private opinion is, that Conway 
never meant to act as Inspector Gen'l , or to carry his new grade of major general into the field ; but that his vanity being amply gratified by his exaltation, not only 
above the brigadiers, but even the major generals, he was desirous of retiring to a more lucrative and less dangerous employment in the service of the states at 
home. I hope that some virtuous and patriotic men, will form a countermine to blow up the pernicious junto spoken of above. 
</p><p>
I have taken the liberty of writing to you my dear father on this subject, in order that you might be more minutely acquainted with it. 
</p><p>
I have been obliged to do it in a hurry, and in a small, noisy, crowded room. I have succeeded so far with secrecy, and dare not venture upon a more decent 
copy. I hope, therefore, that you will excuse my letter, and accept it in its present dress. 
</p><p>
I hope it will find you perfectly reliev'd from your old enemy, the gout, and in condition to save America from her most dangerous enemies. 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">JOHN LAURENS</a>.
</p><p>
I hope Congress will not lose sight of the office of inspector Gen'l .

My Dear Father: 
</p><p>
Some commercial technicalities puzzled me in the 
letters which you sent me to translate. My French 
acquaintance here are almost as much at a loss how 
to render the words in question, as much as I was my 
self; however, I believe the following explanations are 
right: fonsage, one of the articles of charge in the 
account sales, signifies, filling up, or packing ; it stands 
thus in the original, an tonnelier ponr fonsaye $ foneage, 
i. e., to the cooper for packing gabarage ; another charge 
is properly cooperage, or repairs to the cask. 
</p><p>
Livraison, another charge, means the delivery ; but I 
can t explain what delivery is to be understood, as it 
is unconnected with any other word. 
</p><p>
Babut & Labouchere in one of their letters say, 
" We are sorry the goods per Capt. Cochran were ovaries. 
The blank in this part of my translation is to be sup 
plied with the word averaged; the cargo, I suppose, 
received some damage at sea. 
</p><p>
In another letter, where they relate the prices curr , 
goudron means tar, and bray, I can only guess, means 
green tar, for it is placed among the productions of the 
pine tree, and it cannot signify pitch, for that is 
express'd by poix. I am exceedingly sorry that my 
ignorance in these matters has made me bungle so, but 
hope there will be no ill consequence arise from it. 
</p><p>
The continuance of your pains is a great affliction to me ; and if sympathy can alleviate, or prayers avail 
to remove the evil, the tenderness of the former causes 
the latter incessantly to now from

means which are taken in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> to discredit the

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
This will be delivered to you by the Chevalier de 
Mauduit de Plessis, whose name I mentioned to you 
in one of my late letters. I am happy in having an 
opportunity of recommending so worthy a man to your 
protection. he was employed by the Commander in 
chief, to act at Red Bank in the capacities of engineer 
and commandant of artillery, and acquitted himself 
so well as to obtain panegyricks approaching to rapture from the officers who were witnesses of his conduct. The alterations which he made in the works of 
his post shew'd that he had not contained himself to 
one branch of military knowledge, but had extended 
his studies with success to one which is generally held 
as a mystery apart. His admirable behaviour during 
the action which proved fatal to so many daring Hessians ; his saving some valuable artillery and stores by 
preferring the public interest to his own safety; his 
exposing his life by blowing up the magazine at Fort 
Mercer without the preparation which is usually made 
in such cases for the security of the operator, and his 
gallant conduct on all occasions, entitle him to the 
promotion which his Excellency solicits for him. The 
letter which Mr. Duplessis now carries to Congress 
would have gone in the order of time, if his modesty 
had not made him backward in speaking of himself. 
I interest myself greatly in his success because I know 
his merit. As this is the only reason that can prevail 
with you to befriend any man who is soliciting public 
reward, I recommend this gentleman with confidence ; 
and if it is in your power to assist him in procuring a 
brevet of lieutenant colonel, expressing the reasons 
for his promotion, and bearing date the 26th November, in order that those who are not his seniors in 
France may not have a right to command him here, 
I entreat you to do it, as you will essentially serve a 
young man, whose military ardour and talents make 
him valuable to the United States. 
</p><p>
I am with every sentiment of filial affection your 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">JOHN LAURENS</a>.
</p><p>
As there is a great demand for commissions, his 
</p><p>
Excellency desires me to apply for a large number of 
blanks to be sent by the next courier.

President of Congress.

I barely hinted to you, my dearest father, my desire 
to augment the Continental forces from an untried 
source. I wish I had any foundation to ask for an 
extraordinary addition to those favours which I have 
already received from you. I would solicit you to 
cede me a number of your able bodied men slaves, 
instead of leaving me a fortune. 
</p><p>
I would bring about a two-fold good ; first, I would 
advance those who are unjustly deprived of the rights 
of mankind to a state which would be a proper gradation between abject slavery and perfect liberty, and 
besides I would reinforce the defenders of liberty 
with a number of gallant soldiers. Men, who have 
the habit of subordination almost indelibly impressed 
on them, would have one very essential qualification 
of soldiers. I am persuaded that if I could obtain 
authority for the purpose, I would have a corps of such 
men trained, uniformly clad, equip'd and ready in 
every respect to act at the opening of the next campaign. The ridicule that may be thrown on the 
color, I despise, because I am sure of rendering essential service to my country. I am tired of the languor 
with which so sacred a war as this is carried on. My 
circumstances prevent me from writing so long a 
letter as I expected and wish'd to have done on a 
subject which I have much at heart. I entreat you 
to give a favorable answer to

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I wish it were in my power to enter fully into every 
part of your kind letters dated the 8th and 16th inst, 
but as that will be impossible by the present opportunity I must confine myself to thanking you for the 
information which you have given me in some 
important points, and replying briefly to several questions which you ask me : 
</p><p>
First, the Barou'd Arendt is a German, who served 
as he says in quality of aide de camp to the K. of 
Prussia ; was colonel in our service of a battalion of 
Germans and their descendants raised in Maryland 
and this State, was sent afterwards to take the command at Fort Mifflin where his ill health suffered him 
to stay but a short time. He has undoubtedly great 
military talents ; but I have heard that Gen'l Muhlenberg, who commanded the brigade to which the German 
regiment is attached, and the officers of the regiment, call the baron's probity into question. His Excellency has neither seen nor heard any thing of this gentleman that could give him an unfavourable opinion of him. 
</p><p>
We have never had any particular account of the prizes in the Delaware. One or two of those taken 
on the Jersey shore, from their vicinity to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> yielded but little profit to the captors, as they 
were obliged to burn them before they could unload them. 
</p><p>
The Chevalier de Neuville with his brother and companions sets out for York to-morrow. I take the 
Cheval'r to be a gentleman whose thirst for glory, and whose military knowledge would make him an acquisition to the army of the United States. The younger 
brother as far as I can judge from his appearance, tho inferior in knowledge, is animated with sentiments that characterize the soldier. 
</p><p>
The resolution of Congress respecting <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Burgoyne</a> and his army, I think both founded in justice 
and policy. It might have been better perhaps if a little more republican laconism had been used in explaining the reasons for it. 
</p><p>
The letter said to be the general's is partly genuine 
and partly spurious. Those who metamorphosed the 
intercepted original committed an error in point of 
time, for Mrs. Washington was with the general in 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> at the date of it. 
</p><p>
You asked me, my dear father, what bounds I have 
set to my desire of serving my country in the military 
line ? I answer glorious death, or the triumph of the 
cause in which we are engaged. 
</p><p>
I must not conclude without giving you a short 
account of a brilliant defence lately made by a few of 
Cap* Lee's troop. Near two hundred of the enemy's 
light dragoons made an attempt to surprise the captain 
in his quarters. They concealed their march by a 
circuitous road, and arrived at the house a little after 
day-break conducted by an intelligent guide. Lee 
had at the time with him only his lieutenant, Mr. Lindsay, a corporal and four privates, and Major Jameson of the same regiment who happen'd to be 
there on a visit. They posted themselves in the 
house and made the necessary preparations for defence. 
Capt. Delancy, who commanded the enemy's advanced 
guard, led it on bravely till he arrived under cover of 
the eves, while the main body kept up a constant fire 
from a distance on the windows. After repeated 
efforts had been made to enter the house, the party 
repulsed made an attempt to seize the horses which 
were in the stable, but such a well directed constant 
fire was kept up from the house that the bravest dragoon did not venture to dismount. The loss of the 
enemy was one commissioned officer and three or four 
privates. The party in its retreat picked up a quarter-master's serjeant and a couple of videttes. Lieutenant Lindsay was wounded in the hand. Too much 
praise cannot be bestowed upon the officers and men

who had the honor of forcing such an incomparable 
superiority of numbers to a shameful retreat. Capt. Nichols was at Lee's quarters in his way from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> during the action, and gives our little party 
great applause as I have been told.

We have some as brave individuals among our

they possess a docility and patience which astonish

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> gives me an opportunity 
of thanking you for your kind letter of the 25th . The 
intended expedition to Canada that gentleman had 
communicated to me the day before in confidence, 
and by giving me the perusal of his letter to you on 
the subject had discovered his aversion to a certain 
general as second in command. 
</p><p>
The policy of the enterprise does not appear to me 
good in our present circumstances, for altho numbers 
may be employed in this that could not be engaged in 
any other, counting volunteers from the Eastern states 
and the well affected of the country into which the war 
is carried, yet a certain quantity of strength and treasure will be employed, which might be better applied 
elsewhere. I am speaking on the supposition that it 
is impossible for us to hold our conquests in Canada, 
while the enemy continues superior to us by sea. 
</p><p>
Towns and fortifications and some military stores 
may be destroyed; the unhappy Canadians will be 
forced to side by turns with the party in possession, 
and experience the redoubled horrors of war. 
</p><p>
The organization of the force which we are to use, 
as far as we are acquainted with it here, does not give 
satisfaction. It is feared that the ambition and 
intriguing spirit of Con way will be subversive of the 
public good, while he will proceed securely behind 
the shield of his commanding officer, taking to 
himself the merit of every thing praiseworthy and 
attributing every misfortune to the ostensible head. 
The person who is appointed Q. master for this 
expedition, is said to be a man skilfull in enriching 
himself at the public expense. 
</p><p>
Our friend the M's . knowing the existence of a 
certain faction, and penetrating the character of his second, has prudently resolved to wait upon Congress, 
and to find out the extent of their views in sending 
forces into Canada, that he may act correspondently 
and not have the secret of their intentions deposited 
in another man while he has the command. 
</p><p>
I cannot altogether clear up the matter which you 
allude to. I think I told you in my first letters on the 
subject whence the general derived his knowledge of 
the existence of the insolent paragraph, and it does 
not appear extraordinary to me that a certain gentle 
man who was capable of writing it, should afterwards 
deny it. 
</p><p>
I am called upon to attend the general to his first 
official interview with the congressional committee, 
and have time only to repeat that I am ever,

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
The more I reflect upon the difficulties and delays 
which are likely to attend the completing our Continental regiments, the more anxiously is my mind bent 
upon the scheme, which I lately communicated to you. 
The obstacles to the execution of it had presented 
themselves to me, but by no means appeared insurmountable. I was aware of having that monstrous 
popular prejudice, open-mouthed against me, of under 
taking to transform beings almost irrational, into well 
disciplined soldiers, of being obliged to combat the 
arguments, and perhaps the intrigues, of interested 
persons. But zeal for the public service, and an ardent 
desire to assert the rights of humanity, determined me 
to engage in this arduous business, with the sanction 
of your consent. My own perseverance, aided by the 
countenance of a few virtuous men, will, I hope, 
enable me to accomplish it. 
</p><p>
You seem to think, my dear father, that men reconciled by long habit to the miseries of their condition, 
would prefer their ignominious bonds to the untasted 
sweets of liberty, especially when offer'd upon the 
terms which I propose. 
</p><p>
I confess, indeed, that the minds of this unhappy 
species must be debased by a servitude, from which 
they can hope for no relief but death, and that every 
motive to action but fear, must be nearly extinguished 
in them. But do you think they are so perfectly 
moulded to their state as to be insensible that a better 
exists ? Will the galling comparison between them 
selves and their masters leave them unenlightened in 
this respect ? Can their self love be so totally annihilated as not frequently to induce ardent wishes for a change ? 
</p><p>
You will accuse me, perhaps, my dearest friend, of 
consulting my own feelings too much; but I am 
</p><p>
tempted to believe that this trampled people have so 
much human left in them, as to be capable of aspiring 
to the rights of men by noble exertions, if some friend 
to mankind would point the road, and give them a 
prospect of success. If I am mistaken in this, I would 
avail myself, even of their weakness, and, conquering 
one fear by another, produce equal good to the public. 
You will ask in this view, how do you consult the 
benefit of the slaves ? I answer, that like other men, 
they are the creatures of habit. Their cowardly ideas 
will be gradually effaced, and they will be modified 
anew. Their being rescued from a state of perpetual 
humiliation, and being advanced, as it were, in the 
scale of being, will compensate the dangers incident 
to their new state. 
</p><p>
The hope that will spring in each man's mind, 
respecting his own escape, will prevent his being 
miserable. Those who fall in battle will not lose 
much ; those who survive will obtain their reward. 
Habits of subordination, patience under fatigues, sufferings and privations of every kind, are soldierly 
qualifications, which these men possess in an eminent 
degree. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, my dearest friend and father, I 
hope that my plan for serving my country and the 
oppressed negro race will not appear to you the chimera of a young mind, deceived by a false appearance 
of moral beauty, but a laudable sacrifice of private 
interest, to justice and the public good. 
You say, that my resources would be small, on 
account of the proportion of women and children. 
I do not know whether I am right, for I speak from 
impulse, and have not reasoned upon the matter. I 
say, altho my plan is at once to give freedom to the 
negroes, and gain soldiers to the states ; in case of 
concurrence, I sh'd sacrifice the former interest, and 
therefore w'd change the women and children for able bodied men. The more of these I could obtain, the 
better ; but forty might be a good foundation to begin 
upon. 
</p><p>
It is a pity that some such plan as I propose could 
not be more extensively executed by public authority. 
A well chosen body of 5,000 black men, properly officer d, to act as light troops, in addition to our present 
establishment, might give us decisive success in the 
next campaign. 
</p><p>
1 have long deplored the wretched state of these 
men, and considered in their history, the bloody wars 
excited in Africa, to furnish America with slaves 
the groans of despairing multitudes, toiling for the 
luxuries of merciless tyrants. 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of conversing with you, 
sometimes, upon the means of restoring them to their 
rights. When can it be better done, than when their 
enfranchisement may be made conducive to the pub 
lic good, and be modified, as not to overpower their 
weak minds? 
</p><p>
You ask, what is the general's opinion, upon this 
</p><p>
subject ? He is convinced, that the numerous tribes 
of blacks in the southern parts of the continent., offer 
a resource to us that should not be neglected. With 
respect to my particular plan, he only objects to it, 
with the arguments of pity for a man who would be 
less rich than he might be. 
</p><p>
I am obliged, my dearest friend and father, to take 
my leave for the present ; you will excuse whatever 
exceptionable may have escaped in the course of my 
letter, and accept the assurance of filial love, and 
</p><p>
respect of

My Dear Father :

I am happy in having an opportunity of introducing 
to your acquaintance the brave Col Fleury, whose 
reputation is not unknown to you. At the same time, 
I cannot but regret that he is called to another 
employment when I was in hopes of having engaged 
him as a colleague and coadjutor in raising the famous 
black battalion, with which I have troubled you so

The resolutions of Congress is a sufficient recommendation of this young gentleman to your notice. I

His affairs call him to Virginia, and as he means to

I have to thank you, my dear father, for two shirts, 
and a piece of scarlet cloth. I wrote to James for some 
hair powder and pomatum, but received only the 
latter with a comb. As I am upon the subject of 
dress, it will not be premature to inform you, that if 
you should command me to remain in my present 
station, blue and buff cloth, lining, twist, yellow flat 
</p><p>
double gilt buttons sufficient to make me a uniform 
suit, will be wanted ; besides, corded dimity for waist 
coats and breeches against the opening of the campaign ; and I must beg the favour of you to write to 
some friend in South Carolina, to procure me these 
articles. A pair of gold epaulettes and a saddle cloth 
may be added, if not too expensive. If you should 
give me leave to execute my black project, my uniform will be a white field (faced with red), a color 
which is easiest kept clean, and will form a good contrast with the complexion of the soldier. 
</p><p>
Inclosed are two letters from Duplessis, which relate 
to his commission. Upon his arrival here, he asked 
for a regimental commission, in addition to that which 
had been given him by Congress. 
</p><p>
The general refused it, as he looked upon the resolve to have intended only a brevet, and that a regimental commission might produce a concurrence 
between him and senior artillery officers, which would be the occasion of discontent, and perhaps the resignation of some valuable men. 
</p><p>
Duplessis understands it differently, and, hoping that he is in the right, applies to you. 
</p><p>
You know my opinion of this gentleman's merit, but I must confess at the same time, that I think the 
brevet is a very honourable and handsome reward of his services. 
</p><p>
It is said here, that Mr. Fleury is soliciting at York a 
farther promotion ; I am exceedingly sorry to hear it. 
All his countrymen agree that he is amply rewarded, 
and that as there was great analogy between the services render'd by him and Duplessis, no greater recompense should be accorded to one than to the other. If Fleury is made a colonel, Duplessis will have the right 
to ask the same rank, and so they may go on till they have exhausted all the rank that exists among us. 
</p><p>
It is a pity that Congress should grant any promotions 
but upon the recommendation of those superior officers, who have known or seen the feats upon which 
the pretensions are founded. The present way of proceeding is productive of great confusion and much 
uneasiness. It is complained, that whoever will go to 
York and speak loudly to members of Congress, of his 
own abilities and eminent services, will obtain what 
he intrigues for. One improper promotion induces 
another, and perhaps several others to silence the 
murmurers, and rank and Congress, I am sorry to 
say it, but I speak with the bleeding heart of a republican, they are both brought into contempt by it. The 
august representative body of thirteen free states is 
said to be bullied by every man who is impudent 
enough to make his own panegyrick, and represent 
his own importance. 
</p><p>
I could not forbear communicating a part of your 
favour of 3 d hist., to our friend; he seems sensible that 
the gentleman, who you mention to have conversed 
with you upon certain matters, is only the instrument 
of more dangerous and inveterate personages. 
</p><p>
Mr. Payne has obligingly offer'd to take charge of 
my letter. I have just discovered that he is waiting 
for it, and as it grows dark and he has a had road to 
travel, I must not farther trespass upon his good nature.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have just finished a few hasty lines and dispatched 
Mr. Payne, hut in my hurry I forgot to inform you of 
an interesting letter which the general received this 
morning from Sir "Win. Howe, in which he declares 
that he is ready to give his consent to a General exchange of prisoners upon the terms formerly offered 
by <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>Gen'l Washington</a>, alledging his desire to relieve 
the men and officers from the misery which unavoidably accompanies captivity, as his only motive. He 
disavows the cruel treatment of our prisoners with 
which he has been so often charged; and quotes the 
license which he has lately given to our commissaries 
to purchase blanketing for the unhappy American 
captives, to establish his reputation in point of humanity. He farther says he is informed that the claims 
upon Lieut. <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Burgoyne</a>'s army for provisions 
have been made a pretext for infringing if not totally 
breaking the convention of <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, and says he will 
give orders for liquidating accounts of this nature and 
paying the balances, when he hopes the proper orders 
will be given by Gen. "Washington for the embarcation of the convention troops. But as this letter is 
not announced to you officially, I must entreat you to 
let the existence of it remain a secret with yourself. 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> left camp on Friday. Duplessis set out this morning. They both have told 
me things which humble me as a republican. Our 
freedom depends upon the patriotic exertions of a few 
individuals. It is with grief I learn that Congress is 
composed of so small a number as fifteen. The state 
of Virginia you see has assented to the articles of confederation. Is there not some latent eastern policy 
in the article which requires a majority of nine voices 
to four to decide every important general question ? 
Adieu, my dear friend and father. I can not form a 
better wish for my country, than that it had more men 
like you. The paucity of such citizens is an unanswerable argument for your remaining in public office. 
I am with the greatest respect and tenderest

A day or two ago, a handsome young lad, who call'd himself Cope, and said he was an ensign in the 35th British. He said that in an affair of honor, he 
had killed his man, and fearing the consequences, threw himself into our protection. He was treated with that generosity which I hope will ever characterize Americans. A collection of clothes and money 
was made for him ; the Marquis took him with him, and is to furnish him with letters for his friends in France. We have since discovered that he is an impostor. A duel has lately been fought in which an 
officer was killed, but Cope was not concerned in it, It is probable that he is some young officer who has been obliged to fly in consequence of some disgraceful action, or perhaps a series of follies. I just had 
time to send the Marquis a message by Duplessis to put him on his guard.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I am to thank you for your kind letter of the 6th 
inst., and the two camp shirts which accompanied it. 
The presumption which would lead me to pursue my 
project after what you have said upon it, would be 
unpardonable ; praying your forgiveness therefor, my 
dear friend, for the trouble which I have given you on 
this eccentric scheme, I renounce it as a thing which 
cannot be sanctified by your approbation. At the 
same time, I must confess to you that I am very 
sensibly affected by your imputing my plan in so large 
a degree to ambition. I declare upon my honor that 
I would not have desired any other than my present 
rank, and that I would even have taken the title of 
captain of an independent corps, for the pleasure of 
serving my country so usefully, as I fondly hoped I 
should have been able to do, had my scheme been 
carried into execution. 
</p><p>
The scarlet cloth, four camp shirts (in all), a roll of 
pomatum, a hair comb, two shirts for Berry, and a 
hunting shirt, have been received at different times, 
and I am exceedingly obliged to you for them. In 
future I will be more careful to thank you for such 
articles immediately after the receipt of them.

The express is waiting only for my letter, which 
circumstance has obliged me to write in haste, and 
force me to take leave. I am

</p><p>
My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have to ask pardon for omitting to inform you 
what was done with the letter for Mr. Bringhurst. The 
day after its arrival here, Mr. Chaloncr, one of our 
</p><p>
commissaries, set out for German Town, on some 
business, and took charge of it. As lie has not since 
returned to camp, I am not yet acquainted of the 
fate of it. 
</p><p>
We have lately been in a most alarming situation 
for want of provisions. The soldiers were scarcely 
restrained from mutiny by the eloquence and management of our officers. Those who are employed to 
feed us, either for want of knowledge or for want of 
activity or both, never furnish supplies adequate to our 
wants. 
</p><p>
I have more than once mentioned to you that we 
have been obliged to renounce the most important 
enterprises, delay the most critical marches, by the 
delinquency of commissaries. Here of late it has 
reduced us almost to the point of disbanding. The 
head of the department is a stationary attendant on 
Congress; what he might do if he had views sufficiently extensive, by a proper employment of agents, 
I know not; but as the case is at present, he seems 
to be almost useless. I have heard it asserted by more 
than one sensible, disinterested man, that the removal 
of <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Mr. Trumbull</a> from that office has been the source 
of all our misfortunes. lie had .considerable connections and influence in a great meat country, and had 
laid such a train for supplying the army, as in all 
probability would have put us out of the reach of bad 
weather, difficult roads and other common accidents. 
Certain it is that the want of providence , or want of 
ability in the present managers, has brought us to the 
brink of ruin. By extraordinary exertions, by scraping from distant scanty magazines and collecting with 
parties, we have obtained a temporary relief; and 
have hopes that the representation of our late distress 
to several persons of influence and authority in different states, will procure us such farther supplies as will 
save us from the disagreeable necessity of dividing the 
army into cantonments. 
</p><p>
To the ill offices of Trumbull's friends we may attribute perhaps a part of our distress. The increasing number of privateers in the New England states, 
the subsistence of the convention troops, and an expedition now on foot, will greatly diminish the meat 
resources of the country on which we principally 
depend. The carcasses of horses about the camp, and 
the deplorable leanness of those which still crawl in 
existence, speak the want of forage equal to that of 
human food. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a> with a party of two 
thousand, is now foraging, but will be able to collect 
only the gleanings of a country over which an unsparing enemy has passed. 
</p><p>
A small detachment from his party under the command of Major Billiard, made an attempt to surprise 
the enemy's picket near their bridge. The design was 
discovered and the picket had time to post itself in a 
stone house, at the distance of 500 yards. Our men 
were saluted with a general discharge ; they marched 
forward and returned the lire, and would have proceeded to storming the house, but it was thought more 
advisable to retire. Our party had five men slightly 
wounded; the enemy's loss was one Hessian killed, 
and another mortally wounded. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>Gen'l Wayne</a> is detached by <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Greene</a> to cross 
the Delaware at Wilmington, for the purpose of destroying all the hay on the Jersey shore which we 
cannot secure for our own use, and which may fall 
into the enemy's hands, and with a view of driving all 
the cattle from the neighborhood of the river, by a 
circuitous road to camp. If he finds it practicable to 
cross the river and carry that plan into execution, he 
is to make a large sweep and return here with what 
ever he can collect by the way of Gorshen. 
</p><p>
The disaffected inhabitants find means to conceal 
their teams and cattle, so that the country appears 
more naked than it really is. 
</p><p>
Deserters from the enemy inform us that they are 
preparing for a grand forage, and that they will probably make it in Bucks county. We have the same 
business in contemplation in the same place. 
</p><p>
I must not omit informing you of a gallant defence 
made by a justice of the peace in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> county 
(0n the other side of the Schuylkil), known by the 
appellation of Squire Knox. This gentleman's house 
was surrounded early in the morning some days ago 
by a party of traitors, lately distinguished by the title 
of royal refugees; he was in bed in a lower room, and 
upon their demanding admittance, was going to open 
to them, when his son who was above, and perceiving 
from the window fixed bayonets, call'd to him to keep 
his door shut and warned him of danger. The villains in the mean time pressed against the door ; 
the old man armed himself with his cutlass, and his 
son descended with a gun. The door was at length 
forced half open by one of the most enterprising; 
the father kept it in that position with his left hand, 
and employed his right in defending the passage. 
After some vigorous strokes, his cutlass broke ; the 
bad condition of the son's fusil had prevented his 
tiring till this moment. He was now prepared to salute 
the assailants, but the old man thinking all was lost by 
the failure of his weapon, called to him not to fire ; 
upon farther examination, however, he says he found 
that by being shortened, it was only better adapted 
to close quarters, and renewed the fight. 
</p><p>
The villains fired seven shots through the door, one 
of which grazed the squire's knee, which was all the 
damage done. They then threw down their arms and 
took to their heels ; they were pursued by the Knoxes 
and a family of militia, and one of them who was 
concealed in a cellar was taken. 
</p><p>
The besetting Mr. Knox's house is a matter of civil cognizance, but it appears that the prisoner has held 
correspondence with the enemy, and supplied them with provisions, and he will probably suiter death for those offences by sentence of court-martial. 
</p><p>
It is said that a number of deserters from the convention troops have found means to introduce themselves as substitutes among the militia. 
</p><p>
Don t you think my dear father that this matter 
should he provided against? I have insensibly written 
a letter, which perhaps you will not have time to read. 
It is not uncommon, however, to look at the exordium 
and peroration ; you may think it policy therefore in me 
to repeat my request for cloths in this place, but I 
assure you it was accidental. You will by complying 
with it contribute to the propriety of the Commander 
in chief's family, and infinitely oblige,

I have barely time to thank you for your kind favour of the eighteenth, and the pleasure of <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron Steuben</a>'s acquaintance. ^Nothing that depends on me 
shall be wanting to make his stay in camp agreeable, and if he enters into service, to make myself useful to him. I deplore the misfortune of Charlestown if it 
has fallen upon individuals of moderate fortune ; if it affects only a number of rich men, it will contribute to equalizing estates, I shall not regret it. 
</p><p>
Gargon being masculine, requires the article to be of the same gender; therefore, une, which is feminine, 
makes a false concord ; take away the e final and make it un, all will be right. 
</p><p>
I am, my dear father, ever your affectionate and 
</p><p>
dutiful

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I was obliged to write briefly and in haste, by the 
last courier. I have since had several long conversations with the <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron Steuben</a>, who appears to me a 
man profound in the science of war, and well disposed 
to render his best services to the United States. In 
an interview between him and the general, at which I 
assisted in quality of interpreter, he declared that he 
</p><p>
had purposely waved making any contract with Congress, previous to his having made some acquaintance 
with the Commander in chief, in order that he might 
avoid giving offence to the officers of the army, and 
that the general might decide, in what post he could 
he the most useful. If I have conceived rightly of his 
character and abilities, he would make us an excellent 
quarter master general, in the military part of the 
department; his office being confined to the choice 
of positions, regulation of marches, etc. But as the 
civil and military duties with us are blended, he can t 
be disposed of in this way; his being a foreigner, 
unfitting him totally for the latter. I think he would 
be the properest man we could choose for the office 
of inspector general, and there are several good assist 
ants that might be given him. I have the highest 
opinion of the service he would render in this line, as 
he seems to be perfectly aware of the disadvantages 
under which our army has labored from short enlistments and frequent changes; seems to understand 
what our soldiers are capable of, and is not so staunch 
a systematist as to be averse from adapting established 
forms to stubborn circumstances. He will not give us 
the perfect instructions, absolutely speaking, but the 
best which we are in a condition to receive. We want 
some kind of general tutoring in this way so much, 
that as obnoxious as Conway is to most of the army, 
rather than take the field without the advantages that 
might be derived from a judicious exercise of his 
office, I would wish every motive of dissatisfaction 
respecting him for the present to be suppressed. 
</p><p>
The baron proposes to take the rank of major 
general, with the pay, rations, etc. He does not wish 
for any actual command, as he is not acquainted with 
our language and the genius of our people. 
</p><p>
It gives great uneasiness to hear it whispered that 
Congress will not probably ratify the arrangements 
proposed for the benefit of the army. If we had as 
much virtue as we ought to have, this would produce 
no dangerous change ; but according to the present 
interested ideas of men, many of our best officers will 
very likely retire from the service. 
</p><p>
The whole corps of officers look up to the commit 
tee of Congress, and anxiously wait the result of their 
recommendations. The most disinterested lament the 
delay, and tremble for the cause of their country. 
My dearest friend and father, adieu. 
</p><p>
I am your most affectionate 
</p><p>

</p><p>
My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have received your three letters, one of the 1'st 
inst., and two of the 3 d , with the very seasonable sup 
ply of buff cloth, which, that I may not disgrace the 
relation in which I stand to the president of Congress, 
and the Commander in chief of the armies of the 
United States, by an unworthy appearance, shall be 
immediately converted to proper use. My obligation 
is the greater, as my want was more pressing, and I 
entreat your acceptance of due thanks. The necessity 
of the case can only plead my excuse for intruding 
such minutious objects on a mind filled with the interests of a great empire. 
</p><p>
The method which you allude to, of procuring the 
necessary article in question, has been clandestinely 
practiced by many. The policy of continuing the law 
which prohibits this commerce, is disputed. It does 
not appear to me, that a connivance at it on the part 
of the states would importantly injure our own manufactories, or encourage those of Great Britain. How 
far it might be pernicious in draining us of specie, and 
in reducing the present slender resources which we 
have for supporting our prisoners among the enemy, 
I cannot pronounce. The greatest objection I think 
is, that our country people and soldiers would be 
debauched by this interest, It is probable that one of 
the principal marts of the continent has capitally suffered by tiro, and that we shall more than ever find it 
expedient to relax the vigor of our first resolutions 
against all kind of commerce with the enemy. 
</p><p>
The naval expedition in which some of our brave 
landsmen, you say, have embarked, will, I hope, be 
crowned with deserved success. 
</p><p>
The accounts which you have heard of repeated 
successes of the enemy's parties have probably been 
exaggerated. The major superintending the Taylors, 
from the best accounts I have been able to gather 
from two of our soldiers, who made their escape, and 
concurrent circumstances, appears to me inexcusable. 
lie had sufficient warning to have admitted of his 
posting his guard advantageously, and repelling the 
enemy with loss, in case they should have hazarded 
an assault. 
</p><p>
The number of men unfit for duty by reason of their 
nakedness, the number sick in hospitals, and present 
under innoculation, certainly emaciate the effective 
column in our returns. 
</p><p>
Similar causes, added to the severity of the season, 
have prevented our completing the works of the camp, 
in such a manner as would have been indispensably 
necessary if we had been engaged with a more alert 
and enterprising antagonist. 
</p><p>
The repeated cavils of some general officers have 
driven the engineer in his own defence to substitute 
lines to redoubts in fortifying the camp, whereby 
the labor of the soldier was greatly augmented, and 
</p><p>
the extent to be mann'd is considerably increased. 
The position which we at present occupy, is not that 
which was at first judiciously chosen. The bridge 
over Schuylkil which was intended to be one of the 
avenues of retreat is so placed, that it is impossible to 
cover it by any work. Perhaps in case of attack, we 
shall be obliged to abandon both that and our huts, 
to the destroying hand of the enemy, and if we fight 
at all, must make a stand in the rear of both. 
</p><p>
It is a very bad principle, to trust to the usual sluggishness and inactivity of the enemy. But when I 
reflect upon the great indulgence of Gen'l Howe, I draw 
some consolation from hoping that he will not do violence to his nature by any extraordinary exertions at 
the present moment, but postpone his visit till we be 
better prepared for receiving him. These truths are 
deposited in the breasts of a few, and must be deplored 
in silence. But every prudent method and General argument should be used to stimulate the different 
states to the immediate completion of their regiments. 
</p><p>
I am truly sensible of your kindness 011 the subject 
of my black battalion. Nothing would tempt me to 
quit my present station, but a prospect of being more 
useful in another. 
</p><p>
The ambition of serving my country, and desire of 
gaining fame, leads me to wish for the command of 
men. I would cherish those dear, ragged Continentals, 
whose patience will be the admiration of future ages, 
and glory in bleeding with them. 
It gives me the most serious concern, to find that you have any thoughts of retiring from Congress. 
That body collectively it is a deplorable truth has 
fallen into disrepute. Firm and disinterested patriots 
are more than ever wanted. I entreat you in the 
name of your country, not to lessen their numbers at 
this critical epoch of our affairs. I think the sum 
proposed might be very usefully disposed. The 
effect greatly depends upon a judicious distribution, 
and would be more certain if the sum could be augmented by other contributions. A gift of this kind, 
deposited in the hands of <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Franklin</a>, at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, might prove a blessing to the sick and naked. 
Blankets, and a few of the little articles which comfort 
disordered nature, would lessen the horrors of a goal, 
and keep our unhappy soldiers from despair. 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron Steuben</a> has had the fortune to please 
uncommonly, for a stranger, at first sight. 
</p><p>
All the Gen'l officers who have seen him, are prepossessed in his favor, and conceive highly of his abilities. 
I must tell you tho , by the bye, that Congress has mistaken his rank in Prussia. He was there lieutenant general quarticr maitre, which in good English 
is deputy quarter master general. He had never any higher rank in the Prussian service, than that of 
colonel. But he was lieutenant general of the Margrave de Baden's troops, after he had retired from the 
Prussian army in disgust, As far as my line can reach, I conceive the baron to be profound in the military science. 
</p><p>
The General seems to have a very good opinion of 
him, and thinks he might be usefully employed 
in the office of inspector general, but I fancy is 
cautious of recommending it to Congress, as he might 
appear implacably to pursue a certain person to whom 
Congress gave that post. Now it is a doubt with me 
whether the gentleman in question was not virtually 
removed from the inspectorship by being ordered on 
the Canadian expedition. In that case, the difficulty 
would be obviated. The baron's own desire is to 
have for the present the rank and pay of major Gen'l ; 
not to have any actual command, until he is better 
known, and shall be better qualified by a knowledge 
of our language, and the genius and manners of the 
people. Then, if any stroke is to be struck, his ambition prompts him to solicit a command. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Washington has received the miniature, and 
wishes to know whether Major Rogers is still at 
York. The defects of this portrait I think are, that 
the visage is too long, and old age is too strongly 
marked in it. He is not altogether mistaken, w T ith 
respect to the languor of the general's eye ; for altho 
his countenance when affected either by joy or anger, 
is full of expression, yet when the muscles are in a 
state of repose, his eye certainly wants animation. 
My proficiency in this kind of drawing never went 
beyond sketching a profile. I never attempted to 
paint a miniature likeness of a full face. There is a 
miniature painter in camp who has made two or 
three successful attempts to produce the general's 
likeness. 
</p><p>
The indulgence granted to <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Burgoyne</a>, I have 
no doubt will operate rather to our advantage, than 
otherwise. He is too much a man of the world not 
to have a convenient pliability, and therefore I am 
not surprised that in his present circumstances, he 
has paid homage to Congress. 
</p><p>
Since the 1st of the month, we have had twenty-two 
deserters from the enemy, exclusive of those of our 
own soldiers, who, during their confinement, had 
been driven by unremitting inhumanity to enter their 
service, and embraced the first opportunity to escape. 
Of the latter class, so many have given them the slip 
immediately on receiving their new clothes, that Gen'l Howe under pretence of paying the passages of our 
deserters to England, for their greater security against 
our pursuit, distributes them on board the fleet, where 
they will either be made seamen, or kept for the ser 
vice of the islands, E. Indies, etc. By the accounts of 
deserters yesterday, it appears that the enemy have 
embarked, or are preparing to embark, a considerable 
number of invalids. The intelligence given by the 
majority of them confirms our ideas of the weak 
state of their regiments, and from Mr. Howe's characteristic caution almost ensures us against an attack 
before his reinforcements arrive. 
</p><p>
We have the pleasure to be informed that the 
recruiting service goes extremely well on in the Delaware state, and there are good prospects in the eastern 
states of completing the regiments speedily. You will 
be informed of Capt. Barry's success with two or three 
armed boats on the Delaware. Two transports loaded 
with forage, one of them mounting six four pounders 
attended by a schooner, mounting eight four pounders 
and four howitzers, fell into his hands, by his gallantry and address. The schooner had 011 board a 
lieutenant of engineers and company of artificers, 
some valuable intrenching tools, officers baggage and 
wines, delicacies destined for Gen'l Howe's table, etc. 
Capt Barry was obliged to destroy the ships, and set 
out on a new cruise with the schooner. A large fleet 
of the enemy's vessels were coming up the river. 
Barry mantained an obstinate light ; his men once 
leaped into the boat and were preparing to desert him ; 
his presence of mind and singular address recovered 
them. He renewed the combat, but surrounded and 
overpowered, he was obliged to run his schooner on 
shore, where he saved the camion and every thing 
valuable, and rendered the schooner useless. You 
may see that I write in great haste, which I am the 
more sorry for, as it would give me pleasure to dwell 
upon the praises due to Capt. Barry. Among other 
tinners taken on board the schooner are a number of German letters and papers relative to the foreign regiments in British service, from whence we hope to 
gain some useful intelligence. Gen'l Knyphausen's 
order of the Lion'd or is likewise taken, but will be sent unto him. 
</p><p>
I am ever your most affectionate 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">JOHN LAURENS</a>.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
This will be delivered to you by the <a href='/results.php?tla=kap' rel='colleague'>Count Pulaski</a>, whose prowess is not unknown to you. 
</p><p>
The dislike of some of his officers to him as a 
stranger, the advantages which they have taken of him 
as such, and their constant contrivances to thwart him 
on every occasion, made it impossible for him to 
command with that satisfaction to himself and benefit 
to the public, which would undoubtedly have resulted 
from their acting in concert with him. He has there 
fore resigned his command, and determines to solicit 
Congress to entrust him with a legionary corps com 
posed of 68 horse, and about 200 foot. With such a 
</p><p>
corps and proper officers under him, to be perpetually 
scouring the interval between the two armies, and 
embracing every opportunity for a stroke of partisan 
ship, he thinks he will render considerable service, 
and I am persuaded from his intelligence and enterprising spirit, that the event will do him honour. 
</p><p>
His military ardour is very great, and he is exceedingly uneasy, lest by any delay on the part of Congress 
he should be obliged to appear late in the field, which would be almost as painful to him as refusal in the first instance. 
</p><p>
He apprehends no difficulty in raising his number 
of cavalry ; to engage the quota of infantry will be 
almost impossible, unless Congress will make an 
exception in his favour to their resolution against the 
admission of prisoners and deserters into the service. 
This is warranted by the practice of other nations, 
and deserters, etc., enlisted in detached corps are not 
by any means so dangerous as if they were admitted in the line. 
</p><p>
The count will be allowed, I presume, the Continental bounty for men, and the rate established for 
equipping his cavalry. His eagerness to distinguish 
himself will not suffer him to confine himself to the 
latter if he finds it inadequate. 
</p><p>
He expects to retain his rank as brigadier. If his 
whole history were known, Congress would grant his 
request with thanks for his generous disinterestedness 
on the present occasion. 
I beg leave to introduce the Count to your acquaintance ; you may depend upon it that Congress will not 
have reason to repent of having employed him in the 
way which is proposed. 
</p><p>
His zeal for our cause and courage, proof against 
every danger will cover him with glory, and I hope 
promote the general interest. 
</p><p>
I am your most affectionate 
</p><p>

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
This will be delivered to you by Brigadier General Du Portail, commanding officer of Engineers, whom 
I am glad of having an opportunity of introducing to 
your acquaintance. His knowledge of his profession 
renders him respectable, and by aiding his want of 
fluency in the English, with your French, you will 
find his conversation agreeable and worth attending to. 
</p><p>
I do not know whether what I am going to solicit 
can be effected, nor would I ask it if it were anything 
contrary to rule, or that could be productive of the 
most remote ill consequences. Mr. De Murnant, a 
French gentleman, offered himself as assistant engineer, under strong recommendations from Gen'l Du Portail. His excellency submitted the matter to the 
committee in camp, and it is very probable that in 
the order of business it might not present itself till 
very late for the ratification of Congress. In the 
mean time, the poor man is kept in a state of suspense, and what is equally bad, of expence. If the 
question relative to him could be brought 011 the 
carpet immediately, as it cannot be a subject of long 
debate or occasion any interruption to business, 
Gen'l Du Portail and himself wish that it maybe done. 
He is at present employed in works of the camp. 
</p><p>
I must not defer thanking you for your kind letter 
of the 15th inst. Tho I am unable to give such 
answer to it as you wish, I still hope that the arguments which you use on the subject of your retiring 
from Congress, will be seen in another light. 
</p><p>
Du Plessis told me that he had commissioned a Mr. De la Balme to put some books into your hands for 
me. My dearest friend and father, adieu.

</p><p>
I was obliged to write you a hurried letter by the 
hands of Gen'l Du Portail and had barely time to 
acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 15th . 
Yesterday I had the pleasure of receiving your kind 
letter of the 22 d with S. Carolina papers and letters 
from England. Among them was the enclosed for 
you, which I take to be from my wife. Her last date 
to me is the 1st November, at which time she and your 
granddaughter were well. I enclose you likewise the 
last letter from Mr. Manning, the others were all of 
old dates. As Gen'l Mclntosh is ordered with a 
detachment on the other side Schuylkil, to cover the 
passage of a large drove of cattle that have crossed 
the Delaware at Sherard's ferry, I take the liberty of 
detaining the N. papers till his return, which will be 
in a day or two, that he may not miss what will be so 
great a treat to him. He has mentioned to me several 
times of late, that he fancied you were retaliating his 
ancient delinquencies. 
</p><p>
I am grieved that you persevere in your resolution 
of retiring from Congress. Your reelection is a 
testimony of the good opinion of your countrymen, 
and I think it is needless to urge the necessity of 
increasing rather than diminishing the number of 
able and virtuous men in the grand council of the 
nation. 
</p><p>
The retiring of a single one at the present crisis 
is a dangerous example, and may fatally strengthen 
the hands of those who have not the cause of liberty 
and the interest of their country at heart. I have 
long anxiously desired to see you, but the unabating 
flow of business in the general's family restrained 
me from asking leave. Two of our gentlemen l are 
appointed commissioners to meet General Howe at 
German Town, for negociating the exchange of 
prisoners. Their absence will render the presence 
of the rest more than ever necessary; but if you 
will give me notice when it will be convenient for 
me to come, I will ask for a short furlough, that I 
may have the happiness of embracing you, and saying many things which are not so well expressed in 
writing. 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron Steuben</a> has commenced the functions of 
inspector general. Several officers whose character 
and abilities give them influence, and are pledges of 
success, are to be nominated as sub-inspectors ; intelligent active men are appointed to each brigade to 
serve as brigade inspectors. The baron has given 
some elementary lessons in writing, preparatory to 
ulterior instructions ; and we hope by this institution 
that the important end of establishing uniformity of 
discipline and manoeuvres throughout the army will be accomplished. 
</p><p>
This I communicate to yourself only, for I don t know whether the general communicates this plan by this courier for ratification. 
</p><p>
The baron discovers the greatest zeal, and an 
activity which is hardly to be expected at his 
years. The officers in general seem to entertain 
a high opinion of him, and he sets them an excellent 
example in descending to the functions of a drillsergeant. 
</p><p>
A French gentleman of the name of Ternaut with 
whom I was slightly acquainted at the cape Fraiois, 
is arrived in camp, and offers himself as one of the 
sub-inspectors. His talents qualify him in a superior 
degree for the office. He has travelled so much 
as to have worn off the characteristic manners of 
his nation, and he speaks our language uncommonly 
well. 
</p><p>
The baron is very desirous of having him as an 
assistant, and says he is persuaded he will be an acquisition to the States. The only thing against him is, 
that he comes without recommendatory letters. The 
Congress have I think very wisely resolved against 
employing any more foreigners unless they are forced 
to it by the special contracts of their embassadors, or 
very pointed recommendations. On this account the 
General has, in order that the baron might not lose so 
good an assistant, put the matter upon this footing : 
that Mr. Ternaut may exercise the office of sub-inspector without rank for the present ; and that when 
his practical abilities are as well known as his theoretical, Congress will determine a rank suitable to his 
merit. It is to be observed that he studied engineering particularly, and would have wished to join the 
corps here, but party differences were an invincible 
obstacle. He has not, however, confined his views to 
that branch of military science, but seems to be equally 
well instructed in every other. 
</p><p>
If an exception to the generally established rule is 
ever to be made, I think it can never be with more 
propriety than in favour of a person who merits such 
qualifications. 
</p><p>
The baron desires his friendly compliments to you. 
Apropos to him, his secretary, and a Mon r de Pontieres have certificates signed by the president of 
Congress setting forth that they are to have the rank 
of captains. 
</p><p>
I think they were not announced as such to the General. <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron Steuben</a>'s secretary is desirous of 
drawing his pay, and upon application to the General, who is not explicitly acquainted with the intentions of 
Congress in this matter, was required to draw on account. This has created some uneasiness in the 
Baron's mind, and he wishes to know whether Mr. Duponceau is not entitled to the pay, as well as rank of captain. 
</p><p>
I think if I could have half an hour's conversation 
with you, my dear father, I could prove to you so 
clearly how much the public interest is concerned in 
your remaining in Congress, that you would not 
refuse yourself to tins duty. Anticipating the pleasure 
of embracing you, I am, my dear father,

Last night General McIntosh returned with the 
agreeable intelligence that the supply of cattle which 
he was ordered to protect was out of danger. 
</p><p>
He received the S. Carolina newspapers in ecstacy, and we had some serious conversation together upon the subject of your retiring from Congress, in which 
we determined that your presence in that assembly is more necessary now, than it would have been at any other period since the revolution. More judgment, more spirit, more firmness in the conduct of the 
political bark are required than ever. So far are we from thinking that your service may be dispensed with on account of the appointment of the other delegates from S. Carolina, that we judge it more peculiarly incumbent on you, in consequence of the choice 
of one whose great talents, from a defect of probity, render him the more dangerous to remain a guardian of the liberties of these rising Slates; and not by your 
</p><p>
absence to strengthen the party of men who make their individual selves the centre of the universe. 
</p><p>
I conjure you, my dearest friend and father, in the 
name of your country, not to leave the fate of this 
empire, this last asylum of liberty, at their disposal. 
Every one of your letters, in which you so pathetically 
describe the low ebb of patriotism, furnishes me with 
irrefutable arguments. 
</p><p>
You do not particularly mention your reasons for 
quitting the Congress at this time. Impaired health, 
diminution of property and other reasons which have 
their weight might be urged, but what can be put in 
competition with the object of your present labours. 
</p><p>
I am happy to hear that Congress is about to reward 
Captain Lee of the dragoons for his distinguished 
services. His brilliant actions have been so frequent, 
that I think their decision need not be preceded by 
much deliberation. 
</p><p>
Nothing but his own modesty has prevented his 
being recommended to the notice of Congress long 
since. This officer only wants a larger sphere of 
action to show the extent of his military talents, and 
it will be for the benefit of the service, as well as a 
piece of justice to entrust him with a larger command, 
and honour him with a higher rank. The presence of 
disinterested patriots is wanted, if it were only to 
patronize real merit, and oppose the sudden rise of 
persons who have nothing but connections and family 
interest to recommend them. 
From some accounts lately received, it appears that 
Gen'l Howe is concentrating his forces. Such of his 
transports as are at sea will be much exposed to the 
dangers of a lee-shore, by the storm of eastern wind 
which seems to increase every moment. The advantage which he will have over us, if his transports are 
safe, and have tolerable passages will be, a power 
of taking the field earlier than we can. If he would 
do us the favour of attacking us in the position we are 
now fortifying, we might safely allow him a superiority of numbers. But we must have our tents early, 
for in case of attack, we must sacrifice our huts. 
</p><p>
This goes under the care of Brigadier Gen'l Woodford, who is proceeding to Virginia on public and private business. 
</p><p>
With the tenderest affection, your dutiful son.

My dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have received your kind favour of yesterday, inclosing a letter from Stephorsts at Amsterdam, which 
served as a cover to a letter from my wife, of the 23 d 
October, in which she informs me that my uncle and 
family were shortly expected in London, to take leave 
of their friends, previous to setting out for the south 
of France. 
</p><p>
Deserters and inhabitants from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> say 
that there are no troops arrived there, except a few 
German convalescents from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. Neither 
does it appear by their accounts that the large fleet 
mentioned by General Smallwood, which probably 
consists of victuallers and forage ships, is arrived yet 
at the city. 
</p><p>
Our commissioners proceeded yesterday morning 
to German Town according to agreement, and a strict 
neutrality and suspension of hostilities are to be 
observed in all the extent of the village during the 
conference. The English commissioners, I am in 
formed, returned to town last night. If they intend 
to do so every night, they will have the advantage of 
constant and more minute consultations with their 
principal. 
</p><p>
I must not omit to inform you that <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron Steuben</a> 
is making a sensible progress with our soldiers. The 
officers seem to have a high opinion of him, and 
discover a docility from which we may augur the 
most happy effects. 
</p><p>
It would enchant you to see the enlivened scene of 
our Campus Martins. If Mr. Howe opens the campaign with his usual deliberation, and our recruits or 
draughts come in tolerably well, we shall be infinitely 
better prepared to meet him, than ever we have been. 
</p><p>
Mr. Francis, who will deliver you this, takes charge 
likewise of your Carolina newspapers.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have barely time to thank you for your kind letter 
accompanied by the speech and letter of President 
Rutledge, on the subject of his resignation. As I 
have not found a leisure moment proper for submit 
ting them to the perusal of the General, I take the 
liberty of detaining them till another opportunity 
offers. 
</p><p>
In the mean time, I have in general terms communicated the intelligence to his Excellency. 
</p><p>
My opinion was formed immediately upon reading 
the matter over. I certainly think Mr. President is 
right in the principle which he lays down relative to 
the limited powers of those to whom the people have 
committed that Constitution, by which they wish to be 
governed. They are to make laws conformably to the Constitution, but they have no authority to alter or change the Constitution. I disagree with him 
when he makes our present form of government have 
such an absolute respect to an accommodation with G* 
Britain, and when he declares the present Constitution of S. Carolina to be the best we are capable of 
receiving ; but I hope to have time to speak more fully 
on this subject in my next. 
</p><p>
The conduct of Congress in giving orders to officers on detached commands, without communicating 
them to the General, is not only a deficiency of politeness, considered as an omission of a compliment 
which is due to him, but likewise a breach of military 
propriety. He ought undoubtedly to be acquainted 
with whatever orders arc given to those who are 
at the same time under his command, that he may 
govern himself by them and not be exposed to contrariate them. We expect the pleasure of Gen'l Lee's 
company to dinner, and are preparing to receive him 
with distinction. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dearest friend and father.

</p><p>
My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have read with attention your kind favour of the 2d inst., and have frequently had occasion to discuss 
the subject matter of it. I have more than once contended, that supposing the Congress should be guilty 
of the greatest injustice towards the officers of the army, a general abandonment of the service at this 
perilous crisis, the consequences of which must evidently be the ruin of our cause, would merit eternal 
infamy. A majority, composed perhaps only of ten men, conduct the present system, will you, to punish them for acting either unadvisedly or even with ill 
design, sacrifice the liberties of America, and desperately involve yourselves in the perdition which 
you bring upon them? That man, however injured by the representatives of the people, who will desert the public interest, is destitute of virtue and unworthy to be free. 
</p><p>
I must confess to you, with grief, my dearest friend, 
that upon a nearer view, I have a far less respectable 
idea of my countrymen than when I beheld their 
struggle from afar, and could not distinguish the vices 
with which they are oppressed. I was thunderstruck 
at hearing a system adopted of governing men by 
their vices, and putting public virtue and patriotism 
out of the question, as nonentities, a system so subversive of republicanism that if it prevails, we may bid adieu to our liberties. 
</p><p>
Before I received your letter, I was generally against 
the pensionary half pay establishment, but had not 
seen in their full extent the inconveniences that would 
arise from it. You have developed some ideas that 
had but slightly and feebly presented themselves to 
me, and have confirmed my opinion ; but, at the same 
time that I require such virtue in those of the army, 
as to esteem the loss of estate a cheap price to pay for 
the honour of establishing the liberties of their country, 
I would wish the burthens of society as equally distributed as possible, that there may not be one part of 
the community appropriating to itself the summit of 
wealth and grandeur, while another is reduced to 
extreme indigence in the common cause. By what 
means this is to be effected wise legislators must 
determine. The power of our enemies and their perfection in the military science, opposed to our inexperience, seem to render it impolitic to arrive at this by 
alternation in military service. Our safety requires 
that we should retain those officers and soldiers who 
are most enured to arms, in order to oppose veterans. 
Can it be effected by taxes on luxuries, which would 
be felt only by the rich ? In a republic there ought 
to be the penalties of sumptuary laws, and should be 
so severe as to amount to a prohibition ; consequently 
no fund could be established by these means, to 
answer any extensive purpose. 
If we were as virtuous as we ought to be, we should 
have those who are enriching themselves by commerce, privateering and farming, supplying the army 
with every necessary convenience at a moderate rate ; 
but as experience proves that it is in vain to expect this, 
all I would demand of Congress, is that they would 
contrive some means of furnishing us with articles 
which nature cannot forego, and which are useful in 
giving respectability to the military state, at such 
prices as bear some proportion to our pay. 
</p><p>
I would wish to see the military state rendered 
honorable, and all odious distinctions of jealousy laid 
aside, for we are all citizens, and have no separate 
interests. If mediocrity could be established Gen. rally, by any means, it would be well ; it would ensure 
us virtue and render our independency permanent. 
But there never will be virtue in the poor, when there 
are rich in the same community. By imperceptible 
and indirect methods, we should labour to establish 
and maintain equality of fortunes as much as possible, 
if we would continue to be free. 
</p><p>
It is a fact that our officers cannot satisfy the simple 
wants of nature, much less make that appearance 
which is annexed to the military state, with their pay. 
It is no less a fact that in every town on the continent, 
luxury nourishes as it would among a people who had 
conquered the world, and were about to pay for their 
victories, by their decline. This I hope Congress will 
take seriously into consideration. 
</p><p>
I would by no means wish our pay to be increased, 
but I would wish to see temptations to peculation in 
weak men removed, and the honest man delivered 
from the necessity of reducing himself to beggary. 
This will best be effected by a public establishment 
for supplying wants at a moderate price. 
</p><p>
I have received your favour, inclosing a note for Bringhurst, which will be sent to him by the first good opportunity. 
</p><p>
Your favour of the 9th is just received, with the blue 
cloth and the buttons, for which I return you my best 
thanks. The last paragraph makes me the more 
uneasy, as I do not know in what way we are menaced 
and what is the extent of the danger. 
</p><p>
"We have heard nothing from our commissioners 
since their arrival at New Town, from whence WQ 
conclude that they are going on well. They were 
exceedingly chagrined at the distrust of their abilities 
which was conspicuous in the resolves of Congress. 
They had been perfectly satisfied with the prospects 
which they had at their first interview, at German 
Town. 
</p><p>
Inclosed you will receive the Kutledge papers. 
The General has been so much occupied that I 
have not given them him to read, and though he 
has got over his great business of a long official 
letter, I fear to detain them any longer. Altho he 
is an advocate for the half pay establishment, on the 
principles of economy and justice to the officers, I 
apprehend that if any other mode were proposed 
for rendering commissions honorable, and enabling 
the officers to subsist with decency, he is not inviolably attached to this.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have barely time to inclose you a <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> 
paper and to thank you for the epaulettes which you 
were so kind as to send me. 
</p><p>
The General sends you a handbill which has been 
artfully thrown out by the enemy, and which, unless 
properly counteracted, will undubitably tend to foment disunion, perhaps the only and evidently the 
surest method of destroying us. The deserters who 
have come in lately say it is a common talk that overtures are to be made for a treaty of peace. Capt. Gibbes 
of the General's guard is now at Lancaster, and I have 
employed him to purchase me summer wear. My 
want of it will depend upon his success. However, if what is at York is very good, I shall be very glad to 
have as much as will make a skirtless waistcoat and a pair of breeches. 
</p><p>
With respect to the spurs which you have been so 
kind as to take so much trouble about, my reason for 
desiring James to have them changed was on account 
of their weakness. Being all silver they are apt to 
break; and I imagined that he might without difficulty exchange them for a pair of plated. If he can 
not, he must get them mended and I must use them tenderly. 
</p><p>
Apropos to spurs, I think in the present deplorable 
scarcity of good horses, it would be a very acceptable 
present to the <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron Steuben</a> on the part of Congress 
to give him an elegant saddle horse. He is exerting 
himself like a lieutenant anxious for promotion, and 
the good effects of his labour are visible. 
</p><p>
The General I apprehend is restrained from writing 
to Congress on this head till he shall be acquainted 
with the sentiments of the brigadiers respecting the 
Baron's rank (but this between ourselves), as far as I 
can learn in conversation with those gentlemen, every 
one is convinced of his zeal and abilities, and thinks 
him deserving of the grade which he asks for. 
</p><p>
Praying your indulgence for this hurried and 
almost illegible production, 
</p><p>
I assure you of my constant love.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
You will receive by this courier, L d North's recantation. It would make an admirable contrast with a 
vehement oration which I heard him pronounce in 
the confidence of success, while I was in England. 
The treachery which he renounces is too palpable in 
his conciliatory overtures, to deceive thinking men ; 
but they may prove a fatal poison if suffered to be 
disseminated through the continent, unattended by 
the strictures of an able pen, which may serve as an 
antidote. If France has not declared war, she does 
not merit our alliance; but I think it is more than 
probable that the sword has been drawn by this time 
in Europe. There is no doubt of Gen'l Howe's being recalled, and that Clinton is to succeed him. The present moment requires vigorous counsels and uncommon management. 
</p><p>
I have many fears relative to our prospects of the ensuing campaign ; they shall be expressed in a short letter. My dearest friend adieu. 
</p><p>
Virtue and vigorous counsels with policy, are more wanted than ever.

</p><p>
My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have read with pleasure the report of the commit 
tee of Congress, on the subject of the insulting and 
insidious overtures made by the British ministers, tho 
I think more firmness and energy would have made 
it more republican. The pardons offered to the subjects of the states who had embraced the party of the 
enemy, will, I am persuaded, be attended with extensive good consequences. The measure is dictated by 
policy, and unites the advantage of being founded in 
humanity. A few copies of the handbill have been 
sent to Governor Tryon in return for the triplicate 
packets of the British bill which he was so obliging as 
to send to the Commander in Chief. It appears to me 
that this proceeding of L'd North will be the signal for 
France to declare war. The reducing the commerce 
and naval power of her natural enemy, increasing her 
own, and humbling an inveterate rival, are objects too 
important in a political view, for her to hazard them 
to the wiles of negociation after they have been 
secured from the chance of war. This apart, the 
death of the Elector of Bavaria, it is generally thought 
will embroil Europe. And if our men in power, and 
men of influence, will redouble their exertions instead 
of being lulled into security, the new and artful 
attack of the British minister, will be foiled and 
expose him to contempt. He will be obliged to with 
draw his troops I mean as many of them as we suffer to escape and tacitly to acknowledge what he 
will be afterwards forced explicitly to ratify our 
independence. At the same time, if no secret alliance 
has been entered into on our part with France, our 
agents at that court need not represent it as an impossible event, that a treaty should take place between 
Great Britain and America, from the degree of affection which may still remain between the two nations 
and the propensity to a connexion which arises from 
the indentity of habits and language. 
</p><p>
I have been informed that the tone of our embassadors was infinitely too modest to produce the effects 
which we had a right to expect. 
</p><p>
It gives me pleasure to find that Congress has directed <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='co-worker'>General Gates</a> to have a conference with 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>Gen'l Washington</a> previous to his setting out for his 
northern command. A proper force kept up in the 
neighbourhood of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, provided it can be done 
without prejudice to this army, may be attended with 
very important good consequences. 
</p><p>
It is a favourite plan with some men, to make a 
sudden attempt in that quarter with a part of this 
army, and change the theatre of the war; but there 
are many irrefragable arguments against the project. 
Their plan is to carry that city by storm ; but the 
preliminary steps to be taken, and the length of march 
would inevitably betray the design. The part of the 
army left here would be attacked and dissipated by 
a superior force. The British army would be recruited from among the numerous disaffected, which 
swarm in this state, and the force before <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
if sufficient to proceed by regular approaches, would 
be obliged to raise the siege with disgrace, upon reinforcements being thrown in, which might very well 
be spared from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> ; besides, as <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
supposing it carried, cannot be maintained while the 
enemy have the superiority by sea, it can by no means 
deserve to be made a principal object of attention. 
But if we are sufficiently strengthened here to act 
offensively, and a respectable force is posted in the 
vicinity of N". York, we may hope for decisive success, and we avoid the risk of suffering the enemy to 
establish themselves, and strengthen their party in 
this state; cut off the communication between the 
northern and southern states, and reduce the Congress 
to the disgraceful necessity of decamping a second 
time. I say nothing of the unavoidable loss of stores, 
whatever diligence may be used in removing them. 
</p><p>
I must ask, my dear father, a thousand pardons for 
this ill-digested and incoherent letter. I set out with 
a good intention, but from my first beginning it till 
now, I have undergone perpetual interruption. 
</p><p>
Cap 6 G-ibbes has disappointed me in not purchasing 
the stuff for summer wear. I must entreat you to let 
James procure me as much as will make two or three

not forbid it.

I snatch a minute to congratulate my dear father, 
upon the important intelligence from France. As the 
matter is represented she seems to have acted with 
politic generosity towards us, and to have timed her 
declaration in our favour most admirably for her own 
interests, and the abasement of her ancient rival. If 
the general languor can be shaken off, and that this 
</p><p>
event instead of increasing our supineness stimulates 
us to vigorous exertions, we may close the war with 
great eclat, provided General Howe does not receive 
timely orders to collect his force and secure a retreat. 
France might give a mortal blow to the English naval 
force in its present scattered state. 
</p><p>
I have just received your kind favour of the 28th ult. I have reason to hope that opportunities for 
writing to my wife will he more frequent and certain, 
and that we may soon find a proper conveyance for 
herself. 
</p><p>
With respect to the report of the committee, I think 
a more spirited answer was required to the arrogance 
and insolence of the British minister in offering us 
pardons, and a part of our rights. I am entirely of 
your opinion on the subject of the proposed addition 
to the resolutions. 
</p><p>
The only reason that can be assigned for Col. Hartley's delay, is that there are better quarters at 
York than at <a href='/results.php?city=valley forge' rel='city'>Valley Forge</a>. The General probably is 
ignorant that he has received his order to march from 
Congress. 
</p><p>
General McIntosh desires me to send you the

</p><p>
Your letter to Bringhurst went some time since. 
I received an answer from him a day or two ago, that 
the body of your carriage is at the painter's in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and that if I give him a pass for a gentleman 
who wants to get a carriage in, that gentleman will 
undertake to get a pass for yours to come out. I must 
inquire who the gentleman is, and if the matter can 
be transacted with propriety it shall be done. He 
promises to finish the carriage out of hand, if this 
arrangement can be made.

I thank you my dear father for your kind favour of 
yesterday, and again congratulate you upon the important intelligence from France. It seems to me to 
have been her interest to offer such generous terms to 
America, as to ensure her prompt acceptance, and to 
avoid every thing which might give room for deliberation and delay. If our embassadors in France 
were plenipotentiaries, the ratification comes of course. 
If they were not, I think it is as little politic as generous to refuse an alliance with France in order to 
accept one upon equal terms with Great Britain. 
</p><p>
There is still a prejudice in the minds of many 
people in favour of the latter, which should be wisely 
counteracted, or that power will gain by artful policy 
what she has lost in the field of battle. The intelligence seems to diffuse sincere joy. We only wait 
for leave from Congress to signify that of the army, 
by sounds which will reach the ears of the enemy.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have to ask pardon for omitting in my last, to 
thank you for the striped dimity, which you were so 
kind as to send me. It did not occur to me till it 
was too late to recall the messenger, and my uneasiness was the greater, as I had heen frequently a delinquent in this way. 
</p><p>
Yesterday we celebrated the new alliance, with 
as much splendour as the short notice would allow. 
Divine service preceded the rejoicing. After a pro 
per pause, the several brigades marched by their right 
to their posts in order of battle, and the line was 
formed with admirable rapidity and precision. Three 
salutes of artillery, thirteen each, and three General discharges of a running fire by the musquetry, were 
given in honour of the king of France, the friendly 
European powers, and the United American States. 
Loud huzzas ! 
</p><p>
The order with which the whole was conducted, 
the beautiful effect of the running fire, which was 
executed to perfection, the martial appearance of the 
troops, gave sensible pleasure to every one present. 
The whole was managed by signal, and the plan, as 
formed by <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron De Steuben</a>, succeeded in every 
particular, which is in a great measure attributed to 
his unwearied attention, and to the visible progress 
which the troops have already made, under his 
discipline. 
</p><p>
A cold collation was given afterwards, at which all 
the officers of the army, and some ladies of the neighbourhood were present. Triumph beamed in every 
countenance. The greatness of mind and policy of 
Louis XVI were extol'd , and his long life toasted with as much sincerity as that of the British king used to 
be in former times. The General received such 
proofs of the love and attachment of his officers as 
must have given him the most exquisite feelings. 
</p><p>
But amid all this inundation of joy, there is a con 
duct observed towards him by certain great men 
which, as it is humiliating, must abate his happiness. 
I write with all the freedom of a person addressing 
himself to his dearest friend, and with all the unconstraint of a person delivering an unconsequential 
private opinion. I think, then, the Commander in 
Chief of this army is not sufficiently informed of all 
that is known by Congress of European affairs. Is it 
not a galling circumstance, for him to collect the 
most important intelligence piece-meal, and as they 
choose to give it, from gentlemen who come from 
York ? Apart the chagrin which he must necessarily 
feel at such an appearance of slight, it should be considered that in order to settle his plan of operations 
for the ensuing campaign, he should take into view 
the present state of European affairs, and Congress 
should not leave him in the dark. 
</p><p>
If ever there was a man in the world whose mode 
ration and patriotism fitted him for the command of a 
republican army, he is, and he merits an unrestrained 
confidence. 
</p><p>
You will receive copies of letters from and to the 
genera], respecting Monsieur de Neuville. If I recollect right, that gentleman aims at the rank of brigadier. This, I can venture to assure you, the General does not think either politic or proper to be granted to 
him. I took the liberty of mentioning this, that the 
General's letter which is couched in polite terms, 
might not induce an opinion of his approving the 
demands of M. de la Neuville. The general thinks 
him a man of merit and liberal sentiments, but that 
he looks too high. I take the liberty which is 
allowed when the restraint of officiality is laid, to say 
many things which cannot with propriety be said in 
public letters. And am with as much respect for you 
in your public capacity, as love and friendship in our 
</p><p>
private relation, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I felicitate you upon the declaration of war between 
England and France ; for though we have no positive intelligence of the event, its immediate and sure 
precursors have taken place, from whence we may 
fairly conclude that it has followed in due course. 
The sarcastical declaration of Mons r de failles, 
proves the contempt which the French have for the 
British power in its present dismembered state, their 
confidence in their own strength seconded by that of 
their own allies, and is the most humiliating stroke 
that the national pride of Britain ever suffered. If 
</p><p>
she is not instantly driven to negotiate a disgraceful 
peace, she must principally depend upon powerful 
naval exertions. Her superiority in this kind of war, 
might gain her great advantages, and in some degree 
reestablish her affairs, were not American privateers, 
and the rising Continental army in the opposite scale. 
L'd North talks of new levies for internal defence. 
The idea of reinforcements to act offensively in America seems to be dropped. Indeed, my private 
opinion is, that's r Wm Howe or's r Harry Clinton 
has received orders to evacuate <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> after 
doing as much mischief as possible. The great preparations which are making for a grand exhibition of 
pageantry, if it be true as it is said, that a new building which is now rising is intended for a ceremony 
relative to the order of knighthood, and every kind of show that is made of a design to remain in Philadelphia, rather confirm than shake my opinion. 
</p><p>
It gives me concern that there is no immediate prospect of closing the war with brilliancy. A successful 
general action, or some happy stroke upon one of 
the important points of which the enemy are at pre 
sent in possession, would be very desirable, as it 
would clearly establish the military reputation of our 
country, render us more independent of our allies, 
raise the character of our General, and give all young 
soldiers one more opportunity of distinguishing them 
selves in the dear cause of their country. 
</p><p>
I heard by mere accident from General's Clair that the legislative powers had ventured to alter the constitution of S Carolina, that it is now degenerated 
into an aristocracy. This has occasioned no less surprise than unhappiness in my mind. I should not have imagined that in a country where the people are 
generally enlightened, and of an independent spirit, we should have suffered the depositaries of our constitution to usurp a power which is inherent only in 
the people, and to have corrupted what they were 
delegated to preserve. If this passes with impunity, 
the same men may next vote themselves perpetual 
representatives of the people. A few men of powerful 
influence may next have credit enough to take all 
government into their own hands. To an oligarchy 
succeeds a monarchy, limited by a few checks, which 
may be easily removed by an artful prince, and 
make way for despotism. It will be said that the 
confederate states, and the temper of the Carolinians 
themselves, would never suffer corruption to go 
such lengths; but I only observe that it is of the 
most fatal tendency to suffer fundamental principles 
to be violated, and that the measures taken by our 
present representatives are subversive of liberty. If 
your leisure will permit, I entreat to send me some 
account of these transactions, or perhaps I shall be 
able to get it from Mr Drayton, who, I understand, 
is on his way to camp. 
</p><p>
The general officers are just now assembled to take 
the oath of allegiance. 
</p><p>
The independent States of America will have the 
first oath that ever I took. As this matter is intended 
for the vulgar, I think it a pit}* that more solemnity 
and awe is not attached to the ceremony. 
</p><p>
My dearest friend and father I tenderly embrace 
</p><p>
you.

</p><p>
My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I was obliged to break off abruptly in my last letter 
and send it unfinished. To resume the thread of 
narration will be hardly possible ; indeed it would not 
be worth troubling you with, as you must have heard 
before this time of the principal circumstances of our 
retreat, and the failure of the British disposition. 
Generals Clinton and Howe were both out with the 
whole army, deducting the necessary guards for the 
city. One of the columns executed a march of 35 
miles which proved fatal to several of their plethoric 
soldiers. 
</p><p>
The Marquis made a brilliant retreat, and left the 
surrounding enemy to return to the city with precipitation. The firing of our alarm guns at camp, the 
crossing a few troops at Sullivan's bridge, and the 
report of a great number, added to the good order in 
which the detachment retired, saved the flower of our 
army. We have since seen a <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> Gazette in 
which our detachment is called a large body of the 
rebels, their number covered under the appellation of 
a detachment. The Marquis is said to have retreated 
in the greatest confusion, and the party that crossed 
the Schuylkil here are said to have recrossed panic 
struck, and to have taken up the bridge after them. 
In the same Gazette there is a pompous description of 
the medley of entertainments which the city had given 
in testimony of their affection for General Howe ; they 
call it a mischianza (pronounce miskiansa) which 
is an Italian word signifying a medley. 
</p><p>
The most recent intelligence from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> is, 
that the troops drew yesterday three days provision 
and had their canteens filled with rum, that the 
women and children had embarked, some of the sick 
had been removed from the hospital and bettering 
house, the spare bedding and hospital utensils had 
been shipped, boxes of arms numbered were removing from the arsenal to the vessels. Coffin and Anderson, a capital Tory house, were packing up their 
merchandise. 
</p><p>
The number of transports amounted to 180 vessels, 
averaging 250 tons each. This does not appear 
adequate to the number of troops, &ca., and makes 
us think that the enemy will retreat through the 
Jerseys, after embarking their heavy cannon and 
baggage, the horses belonging to them, their invalids 
and their new levies, whose desertion they have good 
reason to dread. 
</p><p>
We learn farther, that notice was given on Saturday 
to the officers of police, that the army was ahout 
to remove, and that vessels were prepared for such 
families as should choose to quit the city that there 
was a general despair among the Tory inhabitants 
that the enemy were still at work on their new 
redoubts. 
</p><p>
On Sunday the command devolved to General Clinton. Gen'l Howe took leave of the city and dined 
with his brother on board of the Eagle. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants anxious to know whether their 
persons and property will be protected from the rage 
of the American soldiery if they could be sure of 
protection, it is thought that much valuable merchandise would be retained in the city, which otherwise 
will be sent away. 
</p><p>
The greatest part of this intelligence was given by 
a Mr. Combes, father of the clergyman the old 
gentleman is come out to make his peace and take 
the oath he will be sent back to town, with consolation for repentant sinners. Deserters, townsmen, 
women of different qualities, spies, confirm the sub 
stance of these accounts. There has been such 
diligence used in shipping, that some light carts 
have been drawn by soldiers. Every kind of carriage 
from waggons to wheelbarrows, have been incessantly rolling between the houses and water side for 
some days past. 
</p><p>
It is not certainly known whether they will embark 
or march through the Jerseys ; by the latter method 
of retiring they would avoid the dangers of the sea 
and a French fleet, economize provision and forage, 
be sure of arriving at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> at a given time ; by 
the former they would be secure from desertion, 
and harrassing from such light troops as might be 
detached after them on their march ; but the matter 
is put out of doubt, if what we have just heard from 
Col. Shreve, commandant in Jersey, be true, that 
several troops of the enemy's horse have embarked. 
This being the case, they certainly mean to go by sea, 
as every dragoon that can be mustered would be 
wanted in their march through the Jerseys. 
</p><p>
Col. Shreve adds that the refugees arc daily deserting from Billingsport, and surrendering themselves to 
the civil power, that several companies of artillery 
have embarked. 
</p><p>
The intelligence from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> is that the enemy 
have abandoned Fort Washington and its dependencies. Whether their design is to concenter their 
force at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and make a stand there, or only 
rendezvous there to proceed elsewhere, or divide the 
force that they have at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, part to go to 
reinforce <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and part for the defence of 
their AV. India islands, cannot be determined. It is 
certain that a notion prevails among the soldiery that many of them are going to the West Indies, and that immense desertion would take place if any opportunity were given. 
</p><p>
God bless yon, my dear father; I salute you with 
</p><p>
my tenderest love.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
The moment Mr Boudinot returned from German 
Town where he had a conference with Mr Loring, 
British comm 7 of prisoners, upon the subject of an 
exchange. He brings us intelligence that the com 
missioners appointed by act of Parliament to divide 
us by governor's places, &ca., skilfully dealt, are ar 
rived ; that they are, as we had heard L'd <a href='/results.php?city=carlisle' rel='city'>Carlisle</a>, 
Gov. Johnston, and Mr Eden; that L'd Cornwallis 
is come with them. A spy of ours who left the city 
this morning says, that they landed at 2 o clock yesterday afternoon, and that they came up the river in 
barges ; that five or six hundred sailors had come up 
to the city in boats, and were assembled at the proper 
place for conducting the passage of the troops; that 
no ships remained near the town except the Vigilant 
and <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, who seem destined to cover the cross 
ing, and that all the enemy's sick are removed. 
</p><p>
Some people are of opinion that the arrival of the 
commissioners at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> is a proof that war is 
not yet declared between England and France ; the 
former determining to try what may be done with 
respect to America, by the means of negotiation, 
and preferring in the mean time a suffering of inconveniences and insults, to engage at once in so unequal 
a contest ; and that the commissioners have ventured 
to land in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> from a persuasion that a 
declaration of war will not originate with France. 
</p><p>
It is certain that the commissioners must know 
whether war is declared, and it appears to me almost 
certain that they would not come to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> if 
it were. At all events I imagine the arrival of the 
commissioners will delay the final evacuation of the 
city till a council of war can be held, and perhaps 
some message sent to Congress. It would be an 
awkward appearance for them to arrive at Philadel 
phia with a view of proposing terms of conciliation, 
and to change their ground without announcing them 
selves. But it w'd be full as awkward and disgrace 
ful for them to announce themselves and disappear 
before an answer from Congress could be given. 
All which inclines me to believe that war was not 
declared at the time they left England, and that their 
stay will be deferred by their court as long as pos 
sible. A deserter who is just arrived, says that none 
but the light troops remained in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. Orders had been given for their preparing every thing 
for moving, but the arrival of the commissioners had 
occasioned a countermand. 
</p><p>
Our treaty with France is known ; what the commissioners can hope from their act of Parliament, 
which is an insult to our honour and understanding, I cannot conceive. Commissary Loring told Mr Boudinot with a grave face, that a fleet of forty ships had 
sailed from the British coast and struck such an alarm in the minds of the French king and his ministers as occasioned them to desire the immediate departure of <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='co-worker'>Dr. Franklin</a>, &ca. 
</p><p>
This express was ordered immediately on Mr. Boudinot's return, that Congress may he apprised, 
and have time to deliberate even before the commissioners announce themselves. I have written in 
the greatest hurry, and thrown a chaos of words together. 
</p><p>
I have barely time to acknowledge the receipt of 
your letter of the 5th . Mr. Conway's conduct irritates 
but does not surprise me. The truth of the matter 
with respect to his resignation is, that he expected to 
have been solicited to remain in the service, and to 
have made a great bustle, and increased his importance. As for fighting, I know by what I saw at 
German Town, that his stomach is not so keen set 
for it as he pretends ; but his friends, Gates and Mifflin, sacrificed him at a time when he least expected 
it. However, he has fairly undone himself, and will 
be treated with that contempt which he deserves. 
I shall take the liberty of communicating this matter 
to the general. 
</p><p>
I must beg the favour of you to send by the earliest 
opportunity, a copy of the last resolves of Congress 
relative to the exchange of prisoners, the 21'st ult. 
It has been mislaid here, and the person who had the 
care of it wishes to avoid the wound to his sensibility 
which w'd arise from having the matter applied for 
officially with an explanation. 
</p><p>
God preserve you, my dear father.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have received your kind favour of the 7th inst. 
accompanied by letters from Harry, and one from 
my wife. The former I send for your perusal ; the 
latter contained nothing new. 
</p><p>
Your letter to the general, and the copy of that to the commissioners Howe and Clinton, were dated May ; but the mistake I apprehend in the original is 
of no consequence. I cannot forbear expressing my joy that Congress has replied with so much dignity to the first overtures made to them. If they pursue 
the conduct which they have marked out to them 
selves in their letter, they will act with propriety. 
</p><p>
The insolence and infatuation of the British minister in sending commissioners to treat with America, 
under the act of Parliament which he pretends to call conciliatory, are without parallel. 
</p><p>
I hope Congress will not even suffer the secretary 
of the commission to wait upon them, nor do any 
thing that looks like listening to their proposals. 
Mr Boudinot, who returned this evening from conference with the British commissary of prisoners, 
informs us that the preparations for evacuating still 
continue, and that it is impossible for the enemy to 
remain much longer. He says he has reason to think 
that they will not march through the Jerseys, but proceed to a convenient place down the Delaware on the 
Jersey side, and there embark. This opinion has 
been suggested before, and seems to be favoured by 
a contradiction of a report which prevailed some time 
ago of the enemy's collecting boats in Princes bay. 
</p><p>
To-morrow the army will move to a camp about a 
mile in front of their present position. The unwhole 
some exhalations from the ground which we occupy 
has made this measure necessary. We shall be at 
hand to take possession of our field of battle, in case 
of any forward move on the part of the enemy. And 
while we are condemned to inactivity, we shall not 
swallow the effluvia arising from a deposit of various 
carcases and filth accumulated during six months. 
</p><p>
I am much concerned that you are afflicted with 
any bodily pain. You do not mention what it is ; I 
apprehend a return of your gout. Surely if ever a 
citizen deserved well of his country, you do ; but your 
continued sacrifice of yourself will find its reward in 
the triumph of liberty. 
</p><p>
God grant that your health of body may speedily 
be restored, and equal your health of mind. 
Your most affectionate

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I enclose you a packet which I received from 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> yesterday. You will be so good as to 
forward those letters which Mr. Manning commits 
to my care. The two letters which I have kept out 
of the bundle are one from Mr. Laurens, containing 
nothing new, and one for Anthony Butler, Esq., D. 
Q. M. G., which Gov. Johnston desires me to take 
charge of. 
</p><p>
The commissioners ventured out yesterday as far 
as German Town with an escort of light troops, which 
</p><p>
with the number that have crossed into the Jerseys, 
left only 800 men in the city according to the account 
of a very intelligent deserter. Every account confirms the opinion that's r H. Clinton is throwing 
his men over the Delaware by degrees, and that the 
remainder are constantly under marching orders. 
</p><p>
The grenadiers have crossed the river, and the Anspachers have embarked. 
</p><p>
The packet addressed to yourself and Congress, you 
will observe is sealed with the fond picture of a 
mother caressing her children. I am of opinion that 
the commissioners hope to do more by addressing 
themselves to individuals than public bodies. But 
what prospect can they have of succeeding in the 
least of their views. They must, I think, retire disgracefully, for I am persuaded that Congress will not 
lose sight of those well chosen land-marks which they 
declare they mean to steer by. The honour and interest of the nation, and the sacred regard which is due 
to treaties, unite to make us reject their overtures. 
From their conduct, one would think that they have 
as little opinion of our virtue and understanding, as 
they formerly had of our courage. It is our duty 
to convince them how much we have been calumniated in every respect, and to render their superior subtilty in negociations of as little avail as their 
greater experience in the art of war. I begin to regard Johnston as an apostate to the cause of liberty, and to place him among the number of those whose 
secret wish is rather a change of men than measures. 
The nominating him as a commissioner, and vesting 
him and his colleagues with a power of making governors, are strokes of artful policy, against which 
we cannot be too much on our guard. His reputation as a friend to America, his patriotic speeches in the House of Commons, will be made the themes of many a letter and discourse for seducing incautious citizens. 
</p><p>
God preserve you, my dear father.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have barely a moment to thank you for your kind favour of the 11th . 
</p><p>
Congress, I am persuaded, will act with the dignity 
and virtue which ought to characterize republicans, 
in their answers to the British commissioners. The 
inquiry into the conduct of the late quarter masters, 
must give pleasure to every man who wishes to see 
the betrayers of public trusts brought to condign 
punishment. 
</p><p>
A party of the enemy were out yesterday, and in 
returning left a Mr "Welford formerly surgeon in 
their service. This gentleman made himself disagreeable to the British officers, by his humanity to 
our wounded, and was obliged to resign. He has 
taken an opportunity of becoming a willing prisoner 
to a people whose sentiments are congenial to his 
own. This, I suppose in delicacy to him, must be 
kept a secret. Cap*. McLane, an active, enterprising 
officer, who is constantly near the enemy's lines, sent 
him as a prisoner, and he must be announced as 
such. He quartered with General Lee last night, 
so that I had no opportunity of speaking to him ; it is 
probable he may furnish us with a great deal of good 
intelligence. 
</p><p>
I intend to write to you upon the subject of reforming our regiments, as the French call it. The weak, 
pitiful state of a great many of them, the little prospect of having them completed, the vast good that 
would result from purging the army of a number of 
officers, who besides are not unwilling to quit the 
service; in a word, the facility of bringing about a 
change which w'd be attended with more advantages 
than I have time to enumerate and develope, invites 
us irresistably to it.

I pray God to continue his blessings to you.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
The world looks with anxious expectation for the 
answer of Congress to the British commissioners. 
A paper was said to have been pasted up in camp, 
which contained the terms that are offered on their 
part. The general has given orders to have the 
matter immediately traced. Low artifices of this 
kind discover feeble hopes of succeeding in a more 
regular and open way. 
</p><p>
Doctor "Welford dined with us yesterday, but I had 
no opportunity of conversing with him but in a promiscuous way. He confirms our opinion of the enemy's intention to pass through the Jerseys ; says that 
they have destroyed a vast number of blankets, etc., 
that they have strengthened their cavalry by mounting 
many of their light infantry, or at least providing 
horses, on which they are to be mounted occasionally. 
By this means they will have, he thinks, 2,500 horse 
men ; that General Grant has escaped a court martial 
for his conduct on the affair of <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, 
by his powerful interest, but that he is much blamed 
</p><p>
and abused in circles of officers. The doctor contradicts the report of Gov. Johnston's having been 
mobbed. He says, on the contrary, he is more respected than either of his colleagues, being regarded 
as the only proper person to gain the confidence 
of America, and succeed in the important business 
which they have in view. 
</p><p>
Gov. Johnston, it is said, accuses Howe of having 
acted the part both of a villain and a fool ; the latter, 
in his military operations, the former in wanton and 
unauthorized destruction of private property. 1 
</p><p>
I hope the answer of Congress will arrive to-day, 
that it will be consistent with the reply already made 
to Gen'l Clinton, &c., and if possible be calculated to

The <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron De Steuben</a> has received a letter from 
Mr de Beaumarchais, which informs him that war is 
rekindled between the Russians and Turks that 
the king of Prussia is in Bohemia, at the head of 
00,000 men, where he has already seized a fortified 
castle and two regiments, to show that he is deter 
mined to have satisfaction for the dismemberment of 
the electorate of Bavaria.

Gen'l Reed has some very interesting gazettes, and 
a number or two of the Parliamentary Register, parts 
of which ought to be made public, without delay, 
in the course of calling for authentic papers, and 
letters relative to American transactions. The minority has made some discoveries, which if they were 
generally known here, would prove an excellent anti 
dote to the deceitful arts which the commissioners 
are now practising. A letter from Lord Howe and 
his brother, in Novem., <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a> (at a time when they 
thought nothing could turn the current of success 
from them), inclosed their proclamation offering a 
general pardon to the Americans. But they remark 
to the ministry that it will be proper to make a few 
examples, and upon the whole plainly indicate their 
intention to make as many as shall be found convenient, notwithstanding their promises. 
</p><p>
You will receive by this courier an application from 
the captain of the General's guard. He has had the 
mortification of seeing himself outstripped by a vast 
number of his juniors who had no greater merit than 
himself. He has always done his duty in his station, 
and from what I saw of his behaviour at Barren Hill, 
wants only an opportunity to establish his character 
as an officer of bravery and steadiness, in action ; and 
I really think he is entitled to a majority, at least to 
a brevet for one. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear father ; we pass a most tiresome time 
of inactivity and suspense in camp. I suppose you 
sympathize with us in the latter. I omitted to inform 
you above that Doctor Welford says the people in 
town have no other than salt provisions. Even that 
is brought to them from their vessels. As Mr "W. ought to pass for a prisoner of war, I do not mention 
his name as author of any intelligence, but in confidence to you, not that I think his history will 
be kept secret, but because I would not be the occasion of discovering it. As this courier was setting 
out hastily on a case of life and death, I did not intend 
to have said any thing on the subject of a reform, but 
as he delays I will venture to oifer a few arguments 
in favour of it. Our regiments, as you well know, 
are many of them in a very weak state, and there is 
no kind of parity between them, which is the occasion 
of great trouble and confusion in encamping, march 
ing, the detail for guards and detachments, &ca. 
To remedy these inconveniences, the General has 
issued an order to each brigadier to form his brigade 
into batallions of not less than 80 files, nor more than 
111 ; by which means they will be sufiiciently equalized to admit of their being regarded as a common 
measure for the army, and to facilitate the service. 
But as this is only a temporary arrangement, the 
field officers who are appointed by seniority to the 
command of these batallious, will not pay that attention to the welfare and discipline of the men under 
their command, which they would do in the case of 
their own soldiers ; and, from an idea that there is no 
permanent relation between them, will not have that 
affection for them which the good of the service 
requires. 
</p><p>
Had we any prospect that the States would furnish 
their due quotas for completing their respective batallions, a reduction of regiments would be unnecessary ; but as you and I very well know we have no 
right to expect them to do their duty in this respect. 
</p><p>
My letter is called for, and I must abruptly bid adieu.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
The Chevalier de Cambray informs me that he sets 
out for York ; I must write precipitately to have my 
letter conveyed by him. 
</p><p>
The state of intelligence yesterday was as follows : 
That the baggage of the commissioners was packed 
up, their linnen ordered from the washerwomen 
finished or unfinished ; the troops in town were the 
third brigade which is composed of the Highlanders 
and two British regiments, a few Hessians, the grenadiers and light infantry, and the cavalry; all the 
vessels on the stocks had been burnt; some few 
houses had been maliciously fired at the same time ; 
the park of artillery was reduced to five field pieces 
and two howitzers; the horse tenders were at the 
wharves with slings, &ca., in readiness; the Vigilant 
and a few row galleys lay at the upper end of the 
town to cover the passage of the troops ; the commissary of the light horse had put all his baggage in his waggon ; orders had been given to the 3 d brigade to be 
in readiness for marching this morning at 2 o clock. 
This intelligence was given by a very faithful fellow 
whose mother washed for the commissioners, and 
who on former occasions has given us accurate and 
useful intelligence. This day, three deserters, one 
of them from the corps of grenadiers, confirmed many 
of the foregoing circumstances. A letter from Capt. McLane, dated at noon, informs me that all the 
enemy's park had crossed the river ; that the High 
landers were then crossing ; that he had marched 
towards the enemy's redoubts, caused several of them 
to be manned, and exchanged a few shot with a 
party that advanced in front of them. It is his 
opinion as well as that of others, that the city will be 
completely evacuated to-morrow. 
</p><p>
The prevailing opinion is, that one division of the 
army will march by way of <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, and another by 
a lower road, in marching through the Jersies. 
</p><p>
An account dated yesterday from the city says that 
the enemy have taken all the horses they could possibly collect; logs, planks, blocks, c., have been 
swept to form such magazines as they probably may 
want in the West Indies. 
</p><p>
My dearest friend, you will excuse this letter which 
has been written as fast as ever my hand could 
conduct my pen, and believe me ever your most 
affectionate 
</p><p>

</p><p>
My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I was exceedingly chagrined that public business 
prevented my writing to you from the field of battle, 
when the General sent his dispatches to Congress. 
The delay, however, will be attended with this advantage, that I shall be better able to give you an account 
of the enemy's loss ; tho I must now content myself 
with a very succinct relation of this affair. The 
situation of the two armies on Sunday was as follows : 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>Gen'l Washington</a>, with the main body of our army, 
was at 4 miles distance from English Town. Gen'l Lee, with a chosen advanced corps, was at that town. 
The enemy were retreating down the road which 
leads to Middle Town ; their flying army composed (as it was said), of 2 batallions of British grenadiers, 
1 Hessian grend'rs , 1 batallion of light infantry, 1 regiment of guards, 2 brigades of foot, 1 regt of dragoons 
and a number of mounted and dismounted Jagers. 
The enemy's rear was preparing to leave Monmouth 
village, which is 6 miles from this place, when our 
advanced corps was marching towards them. The 
militia of the country kept up a random running fire 
with the Hessian Jagers ; no mischief was done on 
either side. I was with a small party of horse, reconnoitering the enemy, in an open space before Mon 
mouth, when I perceived two parties of the enemy 
advancing by files in the woods on our right and left, 
with a view, as I imagined, of enveloping our small 
party, or preparing a way for a skirmish of their horse. 
I immediately wrote an account of what I had seen to 
the General, and expressed my anxiety on account of 
the languid appearance of the Continental troops 
under Gen'l Lee. 
</p><p>
Some person in the mean time reported to Gen'l Lee that the enemy were advancing upon us in two 
columns, and I was informed that he had, in consequence, ordered Varnum's brigade, which was in front, 
to repass a bridge which it had passed. I went my 
self, and assured him of the real state of the case ; his 
reply to me was, that his accounts had been so contradictory, that he was utterly at a loss what part to 
take. I repeated my account to him in positive distinct terms, and returned to make farther discoveries. 
I found that the two parties had been withdrawn 
from the wood, and that the enemy were preparing 
to leave Monmouth. I wrote a second time to <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>Gen'l Washington</a>. Gen'l Lee at length gave orders to 
advance. The enemy were forming themselves on 
the Middle Town road, with their light infantry in 
front, and cavalry on the left flank, while a scattering, 
distant fire was commenced between our flanking 
parties and theirs. I was impatient and uneasy at 
seeing that no disposition was made, and endeavoured 
to find out Gen'l Lee to inform him of what was doing, 
and know what was his disposition. He told me that 
he was going to order some troops to march below 
the enemy and cut oft their retreat. Two pieces of 
artillery were posted on our right without a single 
foot soldier to support them. Our men were formed 
piecemeal in front of the enemy, and there appeared 
to be no general plan or disposition calculated on that 
of the enemy ; the nature of the ground, or any of the 
other principles which generally govern in these cases. 
The enemy began a cannonade from two parts of 
their line ; their whole body of horse made a furious 
charge upon a small party of our cavalry and dissipated them, and drove them till the appearance of 
our infantry, and a judicious discharge or two of 
artillery made them retire precipitately. Three regiments of ours that had advanced in a plain open 
country towards the enemy's left flank, were ordered 
by Gen'l Lee to retire and occupy the village of Monmouth. They were no sooner formed there, than 
they were ordered to quit that post and gain the 
woods. One order succeeded another with a rapidity 
and indecision calculated to ruin us. The enemy 
had changed their front and were advancing in full 
march towards us ; our men were fatigued with the 
excessive heat. The artillery horses were not in 
condition to make a brisk retreat. A new position 
was ordered, but not generally communicated, for 
part of the troops were forming on the right of the 
ground, while others were marching away, and all 
the artillery driving off. The enemy, after a short 
halt, resumed their pursuit ; no cannon was left to 
check their progress. A regiment was ordered to 
form behind a fence, and as speedily commanded to 
retire. All this disgraceful retreating, passed without 
the firing of a musket, over ground which might have 
been disputed inch by inch. We passed a defile and 
arrived at an eminence beyond, which was defended 
on one hand by an impracticable fen, on the other by 
thick woods where our men would have fought to 
advantage. Here, fortunately for the honour of the 
army, and the welfare of America, <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>Gen'l Washington</a> 
met the troops retreating in disorder, and without any 
plan to make an opposition. He ordered some pieces 
of artillery to be brought up to defend the pass, and 
some troops to form and defend the pieces. The 
artillery was too distant to be brought up readily, so 
that there was but little opposition given here. A few 
shot though, and a little skirmishing in the wood 
checked the enemy's career. The Gen'l expressed his 
astonishment at this unaccountable retreat. Mr Lee 
indecently replied that the attack was contrary to his 
advice and opinion in council. We were obliged to 
retire to a position, which, though hastily reconnoitered, proved an excellent one. Two regiments were 
formed behind a fence in front of the position. The 
enemy's horse advanced in full charge with admirable 
bravery to the distance of forty paces, when a General discharge from these two regiments did great execution among them, and made them fly with the greatest precipitation. The grenadiers succeeded to the 
attack. At this time my horse was killed under me. 
In this spot the action was hottest, and there was 
considerable slaughter of British grenadiers. The 
General ordered Woodford's brigade with some artillery to take possession of an eminence on the enemy's 
left, and cannonade from thence. This produced an 
excellent effect. The enemy were prevented from 
advancing on us, and confined themselves to cannonade with a show of turning our left flank. Our 
artillery answered theirs with the greatest vigour. 
The General seeing that our left flank was secure, as 
the ground was open and commanded by it, so that 
the enemy could not attempt to turn it without exposing their own flank to a heavy fire from our artillery, 
and causing to pass in review before us, the force 
employed for turning us. In the mean time, Gen'l Lee continued retreating. <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron Steuben</a> was order'd to 
form the broken troops in the rear. The cannonade 
was incessant and the General ordered parties to 
advance from time to time and engage the British 
grenadiers and guards. The horse shewed themselves 
no more. The grenadiers showed their backs and 
retreated every where with precipitation. They re 
turned, however, again to the charge, and were again 
repulsed. They finally retreated and got over the 
strong pass, where, as I mentioned before, Gen'l "Washington first rallied the troops. We advanced 
in force and continued masters of the ground; the 
standards of liberty were planted in triumph on the 
field of battle. We remained looking at each other, 
with the defile between us, till dark, and they stole 
off in silence at midnight. We have buried of the 
enemy's slain, 233, principally grenadiers; forty odd 
of their wounded whom they left at Monmouth, fell 
into our hands. Several officers are our prisoners. 
Among their killed are Col. Moncton, a captain of the 
guards, and several captains of grenadiers. We have 
taken but a very inconsiderable number of prisoners, 
for want of a good body of horse. Deserters are 
coming in as usual. Our officers and men behaved 
with that bravery which becomes freemen, and have 
convinced the world that they can beat British grenadiers. To name any one in particular w'd be a kind 
of injustice to the rest. There are some, however, who came more immediately under my view, whom 
I will mention that you may know them. B. <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>Gen'l Wayne</a>, Col. Barber, Col. Stewart, Col. Livingston, 
Col. Oswald of the artillery, Capt. Doughty deserve well of their country, and distinguished themselves nobly. 
</p><p>
The enemy buried many of their dead that are not 
accounted for above, and carried off a great number 
of wounded. I have written diffusely, and yet I have 
not told you all. Gen'l Lee, I think, must be tried 
for misconduct. However, as this is a matter not 
generally known, tho it seems almost universally 
wished for, I would beg you, my dear father, to say 
nothing of it. 
</p><p>
You will oblige me much by excusing me to Mr Drayton for not writing to him. I congratulate you, 
my dear father, upon this seasonable victory, and am 
ever

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I had the pleasure of writing to you the day before 
yesterday, from English Town, but through some 
mistake my letter was not delivered to the express, 
altho it was written in a hurry. I recollect no circumstance in it relative to our late engagement, 
which farther inquiry and consideration do not con 
firm. From a second view of the ground, as well as 
the accounts I have since had of the enemy's strength 
and designs, it is evident to me that Mr Clinton's 
whole flying army would have fallen into our hands, 
but for a defect of abilities or good will in the commanding officer of our advanced corps. His precipitate retreat spread a baneful influence every where. 
The most sanguine hope scarcely extended farther, 
when the Commander in chief rallied his troops, than 
to an orderly retreat ; but by his intrepidity and presence of mind, a firm line of troops was formed on a 
good position, from whence he cannonaded with 
advantage, and detached light parties in front, who 
drove the enemy from the field. Gen'l Clinton arid 
Lord Cornwallis were both present at the action. 
</p><p>
The reason for not pursuing them farther with the main body of our army was, that people well acquainted with the country said that the strength of 
the ground would render it impracticable for us to injure them essentially; and that the sandy, parched soil, together with the heat of the sun, would probably 
occasion us considerable loss. From the specimen of yesterday's march we have reason to think it fortunate that we took the part we have done ; the heat of the 
weather, thirsty soil, and heavy sand, reduced us to the necessity of bringing on many of our weaker men in waggons. 
</p><p>
We are now arrived in a delightful country where we 
shall halt and refresh ourselves. Bathing in the Raritan, and the good living of the country will speedily 
refresh us. I wish, my dear father, that you could 
ride along the banks of this delightful river. Your 
zeal for the public service will not at this time 
permit it. But the inward satisfaction which you 
must feel from a patriotic discharge of your duty, is 
infinitely superior to the delights of retirement and 
ease. I admire your constant virtue, and will imitate 
your example. 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">JOHN LAURENS</a>.
</p><p>
Col. Morgan writes this day, that the rear of the enemy is a mile below Middle Town; that he has 
had a skirmish with several of their light parties, which has cost them some lives. He had only one 
man wounded. Desertions continue, and I suppose will be very considerable at the moment of embarkation. 
</p><p>
I have seen the General much embarrassed this 
day, on the subject of those who distinguished them 
selves in the battle of Monmouth. To name a few, 
and be silent with regard to many of equal-merit w'd be 
an injustice to the latter; to pass the whole over unnoticed w'd be an unpardonable slight ; indiscriminate 
praise of the whole w'd be an unfair distribution of 
rewards; and yet, when men generally conducted 
themselves so well as our officers did, this matter is 
allowable and is eligible, because least liable to give offence. 
</p><p>
The merit of restoring the day, is due to the 
General; and his conduct was such throughout the 
affair as has greatly increased my love and esteem for 
him. My three brother aids gained themselves great 
applause by their activity and bravery, while the 
three secretaries acted as military men on this occasion, and proved themselves as worthy to wield the sword as the pen. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=' rel=''>Gen'l Steuben</a>, his aids and your son, narrowly escaped being surrounded by the British horse, early 
on the morning of the action. "We reconnoitered them rather too nearly, and L'd Cornwallis sent the 
dragoons of his guard to make us prisoners. Gen'l Clinton saw the Baron's star, and the whole pursuit 
was directed at him ; but we all escaped, the dragoons fearing an ambuscade of infantry. 
</p><p>
We have buried Col. Moncton with the honours of war.

that some of them see <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron De Steuben</a>, who has certainly rendered us very important services, and who is without doubt as capable of commanding as 
any major general we have, appointed to the temporary command of a division in the absence of so many major generals. 
</p><p>
The last accounts from the enemy are, that they were busily employed in embarking their baggage and 
horses. Yesterday I had a view of their fleet, which appeared to be getting under weigh. 
</p><p>
Six grenadiers came in yesterday, one of them a very intelligent fellow, says that desertion prevails so 
much among them that unless they are speedily embarked, their army will dwindle into nothing. 
</p><p>
I felicitate you, my dear father, upon the many 
happy events which have taken place during your presidency, and upon the happy prospects which continue 
to present themselves. May God preserve you to enjoy the complete triumph of liberty and your country.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
We are just about to march. Seventy miles are 
between us and King's Ferry, where we shall probably 
cross the North river. The last intelligence from the 
enemy is, that they had passed the breach which the 
sea has made between Sandy Hook and the main, and 
had taken up their bridge after them. They were 
embarking with the greatest expedition. They left a 
number of waggons behind them, and cut the throats 
of a great many horses. Three signal guns were fired 
from the fleet the day before yesterday morning, and 
they appeared to be all under weigh yesterday. 
</p><p>
Col. Morgan informs us that he had taken 30 
prisoners, and received 100 deserters. I suppose he 
counts from the time of his having been detached. 
I wish I had leisure, and something more interesting

I have barely time, my dearest friend and father, 
to say that my heart overflows with gratitude at the 
repeated proofs of your tender love ; and must defer 
answering your kind letters of the 6th and 10th , till 
my return from Count D'Estaing's fleet, where the

were furnished with a proper number of intelliGen. coast pilots ; that as many pilot boats, schooners and other small swift sailing vessels were employed under 
the conduct of judicious seamen, to reconnoitre the enemy's fleet whenever it appears at sea, and give 
the French admiral the earliest account of their strength, &ca., as well as keep him constantly advised afterwards of all their motions. 
</p><p>
The movement of our army across the I^orth river, 
to make demonstration near ~N. York, may have a

making his fleet so strong as he otherwise would.

</p><p>
You will discover at a first interview that he is a

must refer you to this gentleman, likewise for a more

<p>
I have barely time, paper and ink to write my dear father a hurried official letter. 
</p><p>
Upon my arrival here with dispatches from the 
General to Admiral D'Estaing, I found that the 
fleet laboured under the greatest difficulty in procuring water ; its distance from the shore was too great 
to roll the casks down to the place of embarcation ; 
the disaffected inhabitants either refused their waggons, or granted them only at an exorbitant price. 
I have done every thing in my power to remedy this evil; but as we cannot have too many resources, I would propose that any fast sailing small craft in the 
Delaware may be immediately employed in bringing water round. The southerly winds which prevail on 
the coast at this season, will give them a quick voyage, and they will be in time if they arrive with La Chimere. 
</p><p>
It would give me pleasure to speak to you, particularly of the great qualities of the admiral. He has 
inspired me in the short acquaintance I have had with 
him, with uncommon respect. He laments the insipid 
part he is playing keeping the English fleet blocked 
up within Sandy Hook ; and taking prizes within their 
view every day does not satisfy a man of his great 
ideas. When six prizes were brought into him yesterday, he desired the major of the fleet to give some 
directions about those Drugs, and sighed at not being 
engaged in a way in which more honour was to be acquired. 
</p><p>
Two of the prizes that have been taken since my 
being here were armed, one with 4 and the other 
with 10 guns. One had a quantity of specie on 
board the profits of prizes taken from us. The 
fleet, men and officers appear to be in fine health, 
and eager to distinguish themselves in a naval combat. 
As much as it is against my desire, I must break off, 
an express rider must be diligent. 
</p><p>
My dearest friend and father, I pray God to protect you.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
Permit me to introduce to your acquaintance the 
Baron D Arendt, Col. of the German batallion, who 
in consequence of disputes with his corps of officers, 
which he thinks make it inconvenient with his honour 
to serve with them again, and from the improbability 
of his being placed elsewhere in an agreeable military 
station, has determined to resign his commission, and 
goes to Congress to obtain their leave. I have received both entertainment and improvement in con 
versing with him as a military man, and will be 
obliged to you to shew him such civilities as your 
leisure and your public business will allow. 
</p><p>
I am, with the most tender attachment and respect, 
</p><p>
Your dutiful son

</p><p>
I thank you, my dearest friend and father, for your 
tender letter of the 26th ult. I was upon the point of 
writing to you the 22d , when I was ordered to fly 
with important dispatches to <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Gov'r Trumbull</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>General Sullivan</a> and the Count D'Estaing. I commissioned one of my friends to acquaint you of the circumstance ; 
but perhaps the multiplicity of affairs in which I left 
him involved will have made him lose sight of the 
matter. In 48 hours over the worst, and in some 
parts the most obscure road that I ever travel d, I 
arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, had a conference with <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a>, and proceeded immediately with pilots provided for the French fleet, down to Point Judith. 
Boats were soon provided and everything put in readiness for boarding the Admiral as soon as he should 
announce himself by the firing of five cannon. Here 
I waited in a very disagreeable kind of company till 
the morning of the 29th , for tho the squadron anchored off Block island the preceding afternoon, the 
haziness of the weather rendered them invisible to us. 
In the morning when the fog was dissipated, their 
appearance was as sudden as a change of decorations 
in an opera house. Upon my delivering <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>Gen'l Washington</a>'s dispatches, and <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a>'s containing a 
plan of operations, the Admiral informed me his 
intention had been to proceed immediately into the 
main channel of Newport and attack the enemy's batteries. The day, however, began to be too far spent. 
It was expedient to distribute intelligent pilots in the 
squadron, and, in pursuance of <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a>'s plan, 
the main channel was blocked up with the squadron. 
A ship of the line was ordered up the west channel, 
and two frigates and a tender up the east, By consulting the map, you will find that there are three 
entrances to Rhode Island ; one on the east of Rhode 
Island between it and the main, called the Seakonnet 
passage ; one on the west, between it and Cononicut 
island, which is the principal or main passage ; a third 
between Cononicut and the main land, commonly 
called the western passage. In the first <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a> 
informed the Admiral there were two galleys and one 
small frigate ; in the second, two frigates besides two 
galleys, and two or three frigates at Newport ; in the 
last, two small frigates ; farther, that he estimated the 
enemy's land force, including three regiments posted 
on Cononicut at 7,000 effective. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>General Sullivan</a>'s plan founded on these data, was 
that the Admiral should detach a proper force up the 
eastern and western channels, to take the enemy's 
ships stationed in each ; to block up the main channel 
with the remainder of the squadron, so as effectually 
to cut off the retreat of their ships, and to prevent the 
arrival of reinforcements. The French ships in the 
eastern and western channels were afterwards to cover 
the passage of the American troops from Tiverton and 
Bristol. The troops were not to amuse themselves 
with attacking the works in the northern part of the 
island ; but a sufficient detachment was to be left to 
be a guard upon the troops posted in those works, 
while the main body was to advance rapidly to the 
attack of the fort and redoubts, which immediately 
environ the town of Newport. At the moment of 
that attack the count was to force the passage into 
</p><p>
Newport harbour, silence the enemy's batteries, cannonade the town, and disembark his marines and 
land forces at the most proper place for seconding the American attack. 
</p><p>
The Sagittaire, a ship of the line, went up the 
western passage on the morning of the 30th , and was 
fired upon by a two gun battery of 24 pounders, which 
the enemy had on the west side of Cononicut. The 
Sagittaire returned a broadside as she passed, and we 
discovered from the Admiral's ship an explosion at the 
battery, which induced us to believe that the enemy 
had abandoned it. 
</p><p>
The ship received two scratches in her hull, and proceeded to her station. 
</p><p>
The Aimable and Alemene frigates accompanied 
by the Stanley (prize) tender, went up the eastern 
passage. Upon their approach, the enemy set fire to 
the Kingfisher 20 gun sloop, and to the Lamb galley 
mounting and sent the Spitfire galley mountiiie: 
in form of a fire ship. The Count de Grace commanded the boat which was ordered to tow the 
latter off. She blew up soon after the grapnel was 
fixed, and the gallant officer with his crew escaped 
unhurt. An officer who went on board with a party 
to extinguish the flames of the Kingfisher, had an 
escape equally providential. Her powder room blew 
up while they were on board, and they received 
no injury. The hull drifted over to the main and her 
guns will be saved. 
</p><p>
From the enemy's keeping possession of the island 
of Cononicut, the admiral concluded that it was an 
important post to them. The battery which they had 
on the east side of it, afforded a cross fire upon the 
entrance of the harbour, and the three regiments there 
made it an object. The count therefore thought it 
expedient that we should make ourselves masters of 
it. The most effectual way of attacking it would have 
been by disembarking troops on the west side of it, 
and sending a proper force of ships up the main channel to run through the fire of the batteries at the 
entrance, and take a proper position for cutting off 
the communication between Rhode Island and Cononicut, so as to prevent the enemy's throwing across 
reinforcements ; but, upon inquiry, it was found impracticable to anchor the ships any where out of the 
reach of the enemy's batteries, so that after running 
the gauntlet at the entrance, the ships w'd have been 
exposed to a constant deliberate fire in the harbour. 
These difficulties obliged the count to renounce the 
plan of sending ships up the main channel for this 
duty. It was then inquired whether the ships might 
not effect the business by going up the western channel, turning the north point of Cononicut and coming 
down the main channel. By this means they would 
in the first instance avoid the cross fire at the en 
trance, and might take such a position relatively to 
the harbour as w'd discourage the enemy from throwing across succours. But the most experienced pilots 
</p><p>
informed us that to effect this detour, the ships must 
either have a wind which w'd answer equally for going 
up the western and coming down the main channel, 
or, that after going up with a fair wind, they would 
be obliged to beat down the main channel, or, lastly, 
they would be obliged to wait for a fair wind to bring 
them down from the north end of Cononicut. The 
delay and uncertainty incident to the first and last 
put them out of the question. The second was pronounced impracticable on account of the narrowness 
of the main channel above Newport, which w'd not 
allow scope enough for the ships work 6 , and missing stays w'd be fatal in such circumstances. 
</p><p>
It was determined therefore, that in order to gain 
Cononicut, a body of militia sh'd be applied for to 
make us equal to such a reinforcement as we thought 
the enemy could spare. Col. Fleury and myself went 
by the admiral's desire, to make application for this 
purpose. In our way we learnt that some American 
privateers had been on the island, and that the enemy 
had evacuated the battery which fired on the Sagittaire. We met <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a> on his way to the fleet, 
where he was going to have a conference with the 
Admiral, and propose some changes in his plan. He 
was received on board with the guard of marines, 
and the drums beating to arms ; and, at his departure, 
the ship was manned and fifteen cannon fired. 
</p><p>
The evening of the 30th , the outermost ships made 
signals of the appearance of a fleet. The Admiral got 
his squadron in readiness for fight and chase ; but the 
fleet put about and escaped under the veil of night. 
It proved to be 8 transports with wood from Long 
Island bound to Newport, and conveyed by a frigate. 
</p><p>
On the evening of the 31'st , the Admiral sent a party 
to reconnoitre Cononicut, and discover whether the 
enemy had really abandoned all their batteries as was 
reported. It was found that they had. 
</p><p>
The next morning the Admiral landed in order to 
view the enemy's batteries from the east side of Cononicut. We found in the battery which fired on the 
Sagittaire two 24 pounders spiked, and all their heavy 
ammunition. From the battery on the E. end, we 
had a distinct view of the town shipping, and batteries. The latter lost that respectability which they 
had on paper ; the fire from the ships of the line must 
annihilate them in an hour. The fort on an eminence called Domine Hill, back of the town, may 
require our heavy artillery and some shells. We 
have every reason to believe that we shall effect our 
landing on the island without opposition, as the 
enemy seemed to have concentrated their force in Newport. 
</p><p>
The admiral has disembarrassed himself of his prisoners, sick and prizes. He is in perfect readiness for 
acting his part, and as anxious as a man can be. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>General Sullivan</a> has exerted himself to the utmost, 
but the backwardness of the militia called for from 
the neighboring states the necessity of constructing 
</p><p>
transport boats to supply the place of those destroyed 
by the enemy in their last descent, and many other 
necessary preparations which require time, have delayed us till now, and I find it impossible to tell you 
with precision on what day we shall be ready. 
</p><p>
I fear, my dearest father, that I have tired you with 
detail, and that from a habit of speaking of our operations with my finger on the map, I may in some places 
not have expressed my meaning fully enough, but my 
time unluckily will not permit to remove these inconveniences by writing a new letter. I am just come 
from the admiral to see if it will be possible by any 
means to hasten our land operations. The French 
squadron will want a great quantity of provisions 
whether they winter here or return to France. No 
biscuit is to be had here. Pennsylvania must furnish flour, and bakers should be employed there immediately. 
</p><p>
It is reported that 20 sail of Spanish ships are on 
the coast. Pray, who is Don Juan de Miralles ? 
I am ever your most affectionate 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">JOHN LAURENS</a>.
</p><p>
In the letter which I wrote you from Black point, I mentioned the Admiral's intention to send his prisoners to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. Some difficulties induced him 
to change his plan ; they are all landed here. 
</p><p>
Deserters from Rhode Island say the troops are 
in want of provisions, and look upon themselves as 
prisoners. 
The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, with a division from the 
grand army, is arrived, and his men have had time to 
refresh themselves. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Greene</a> is likewise arrived. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a>'s 1st estimate of the enemy's land force is too high ; they cannot have above 5,000 men, and the Gen'l begins to think so himself.

<p>
My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have just had the satisfaction of receiving your 
kind letter of the 13th . The relation of what has 
passed, since I last had the pleasure of writing, will not 
in general amuse you, but it is necessary that you sh'd 
know it, and I will be exceedingly brief. According 
to the first plan proposed by <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>General Sullivan</a>, the 
American forces were to land on the east side of 
Rhode Island under cover of the fire of three frigates 
stationed in the eastern channel for that purpose. A 
signal was to be given immediately as our boats 
should begin to cross, and another when the descent 
should be effected. Upon the latter, the French 
troops were to disembark on the east side of the 
island, and a junction was to be formed as speedily as 
possible ; but the ambition of an individual and national pride discovered insuperable obstacles to this 
disposition. The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> aspired to the 
command of the French troops in conjunction with the flower of <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a>'s army. In a visit which he 
had paid to the fleet, he prevailed upon the Count D'Estaing to write upon this suhject. The count intimated in his letter a desire that some good American 
troops sh'd be annexed to the French, adding that if 
the command of them were given to M. de Lafayette 
it w'd be a means of facilitating the junction between 
the troops of the two nations, as he was acquainted 
with the service of both, and that in case any naval 
operations sh'd require his (the count s) return on board 
the squadron, the Marquis w'd naturally take the 
command in his absence which w'd prevent many 
difficulties that w'd arise on that account. The 
Marquis strenuously contended that a considerable 
detachment of select troops ought to be annexed to 
the French. The pride of his nation would never 
suffer the present disposition to take place, as by it 
the French batallions w'd land under cover of the 
American fire, and play a humiliating secondary part. 
</p><p>
The arguments against gratifying him in his request 
were these : <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>General Sullivan</a>'s army contained a 
very small proportion of regular troops ; it was necessary that a main body capable of resisting the enemy's 
force should exist, as a contrary conduct w'd expose 
either division to a total defeat or a vigorous attack 
from the enemy. The Marquis, however, seemed 
much dissatisfied, and his private views withdrew 
his attention wholly from the general interest. 
</p><p>
On the 8th <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a> received a letter from the 
Admiral, in which he says that the disposition for 
disembarking is militarily impossible. That the Ame 
rican generals were now for the first time furnished 
with an opportunity of discovering the value which 
they set on the French alliance, by the number and 
composition of the troops which they w'd annex to the 
French. It was not for him to point out the number, 
but he w'd gladly have it in his power to give an 
account both to the Congress and his king of the 
American detachm* which should be sent to him. In 
consequence of this letter, it was determined that 
Jackson's regiment, and as many good militia as in 
the whole w'd amount to 1,000 men sh'd be sent under 
the command of the marquis. The tardiness of the 
militia and the impossibility of completing the trans 
port boats so soon as expected, and the slow arrival of 
the heavy cannon, had obliged <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a> more 
than once to procrastinate the attack. He had fixed 
on the 9th , and for the reasons mentioned in my last, 
the Count was to force his passage with the squadron, 
on the 8th . 
</p><p>
The Gen'l found it impossible to keep his word, and 
wrote to appoint another day on which he declared 
he w'd make his descent at all events. 
</p><p>
The Count, however, had made his arrangements 
and entered the harbour on the 8th . A thundering 
cannonade was kept up between the batteries and 
ships as they passed. The injury to the latter is not 
worth notice. 
</p><p>
9th , <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a> received intelligence both from 
deserters and inhabitants, that the enemy had evacuated all their redoubts and batteries on the north part 
of the island. He took the hardy resolution of availing himself of this move and threw his whole army 
across. 1 This measure gave much umbrage to the 
French officers. They conceived their troops injured 
by our landing first, and talked like women disputing 
precedence in a country dance, instead of men en 
gaged in pursuing the common interest of two great 
nations. 
</p><p>
Admiral Howe's fleet appeared in the offing. 
</p><p>
10th . The French squadron passed the batteries of 
Newport (receiving their fire and returning broad 
sides), without receiving any damage by reason of the 
distance, and gave chase to the British fleet. On the 
11th such a storm of wind and rain arose as filled us 
with anxiety for the French squadron. The army 
suffered much during the bad weather for want of 
tents, and on account of the impossibility of crossing 
the ferry, which circumstance reduced our magazines 
to a low ebb. 
</p><p>
On the 15th , the army moved to a position for com 
mencing its operations against the enemy, and some 
works were thrown up the same night for its security. 
</p><p>
On the evening of the 16th , a battery of protection 
and its communication were begun. The next morn
</p><p>
An officer was sent immediately to give the Admiral notice of it.ing as soon as our unfinished work could be discovered, the enemy's batteries began to fire on it. Our 
works have been carrying on every night since ; and 
as long as day-light lasts there is generally a slow 
firing kept up on each side, without any effect worth 
mentioning. On account of the great distance, the 
method that has been hitherto pursued will prove very 
tedious if continued. 
</p><p>
20th . The French squadron appears and terminates 
much anxiety. The Admiral's ship and the Marseilles 
were dismasted in the storm. The former totally dismasted, without a rudder, was attacked by a British 
fifty gun ship, which she obliged to sheer off, by 
bringing her stern chasers to bear. Imagine the cruel 
situation of the Count to see his ship thus insulted, 
after having arrived in the midst of the English 
squadron and preparing for a combat in which victory 
was inevitably his; but a most dreadful storm of 
which he had no idea, dispersed every thing. 
</p><p>
I was going on, but was called away upon the most 
important business. 
</p><p>
The council of war on board the French vessels 
have determined that the squadron ought to go immediately to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> to refit. I am going on board with 
a solemn protest against it. 
</p><p>
Adieu.

</p><p>
My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I avail myself of Col. Bannister's offer to have the pleasure of writing to you. 
</p><p>
The intelligence which we have received since my 
last, confirms the idea of a grand move on the part of 
the enemy. A British matross who deserted the day 
before yesterday declares that he assisted in embarking artillery and stores, and says that five thousand 
troops are destined for the "West Indies. Accounts received some days since of taylors being employed in 
stripping regimental coats of their lining and making 
up thin overalls and waistcoats, indicates an expedition to a warmer climate than any on the territories 
of the United States, in the approaching season. 
It is reported that many merchants are disposing of 
their wares by vendue at low rates. I am not acquainted with the persons to whom we are indebted 
for intelligence, and therefore cannot be sure whether 
they are the dupes of reports circulated by the enemy, 
or give us a relation of facts that may be depended on. 
</p><p>
There appears to be no other object here for the 
enemy but the French squadron, nor elsewhere but 
the French islands. Either will require an exertion 
of their whole force, and the latter perhaps will upon 
several accounts be preferred. 
</p><p>
Some people are of opinion that they will aim first 
at the ruin of the squadron, and then direct their whole force against some French island. It is difficult to predict what measures will be pursued by 
men, who have been so eccentric in their military operations. 
</p><p>
If they had been vigorous, the French squadron 
might have fallen a sacrifice, and it would have been 
a tottering stroke to the marine of France. But their 
delay and the disposition which has been made by our 
general, have, I hope, pretty well secured an object of 
such importance to the common cause. 
</p><p>
It is to be urged in excuse for them that Byron's 
fleet suffered by a storm, and that the crews belonging 
to it are in very bad health. The division of six ships 
under Rear Admiral Parker at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, has been 
obliged to land five hundred, some say a thousand 
men ; besides, you know, two of his fleet (one of them 
the Admiral's ship), arc said to be missing, and one, to 
have put back to <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. 
</p><p>
The army will move from its present position to 
morrow morning. 
</p><p>
God preserve you, my dear father. 
</p><p>

Mr. Galvan, an officer in one of our Carolina regiments brought me two letters of very particular 
recommendation from the Bn. de Holzendorff and Mr. Reid. Some of our family informed me that in 
a letter to me, which I have not yet received, this person was mentioned in such a manner as excluded him from favour. When he called upon me, therefore, I 
did not introduce him to the General ; he found means however, to introduce himself, and ask the General's protection. The Gen'l asked me in private whether 
this was not the person alluded to in your letter ; I told him he was; the General then left the room with out taking any farther notice of him. Galvan finding 
he had so little encouragement to stay, retired. Yesterday he came again and produced a letter which he said he intended to send to you, in which he desires 
that through my mediation he might be restored to your friendship, and desired leave to read it. I told him he was the master to write what he pleased, but 
that I should not confirm that in my letters to you. He asked me the reason of the cold reception the Gen'l had given him. I told him that I must frankly 
inform him that we had all heard very serious matters to his disadvantage, and besides that, as his only object here was to serve as a volunteer, he might depend 
upon it, that there was no opening for him. He asked me whether I had received any letter from you respecting him ; I told him I had not. He desired to 
have an opportunity of justifying himself before the General, but this I waived. I was then called oft for some business, and he went away saying that he would call again.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have received your kind favour of the 17th inst. 
</p><p>
The information which you give me relative to my 
hospitable acquaintance, gives me great pain. I had 
conceived an esteem for him, and it afflicts me to find 
a new instance of the depravity of my species. 
</p><p>
I am sorry that Kinloch did not return to America sooner. His former sentiments on the present con 
test, give reason to suspect, if he is a convert, that 
success on our side has alone operated the change. 
Something may be drawn in palliation of his conduct 
from the education he received, and the powerful influence which his guardian had over him. 
</p><p>
Beresford's circumstances were peculiar, he has been uniformly a friend to his country. 
</p><p>
The approach of the period which you allude to, 
occasions the greatest anxiety in my mind. The 
public interest and my own lead me to wish that you 
may continue in the august assembly of the states. 
I dread your being so remote from where my duty 
places me, and see collected in one view all the painful consequences of it. It was my intention at all 
events to have paid you the homage of my love in 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, at the close of the present campaign. 
We are at present in a disagreeable state of suspense. 
Continued preparations in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> announce a very 
considerable embarkation. Our spies inform us that a council of war had been held, and continued for 
three days. Lord Howe has certainly arrived. Gen'l Gray's troops had returned by way of the sound and 
been relanded. Admiral Byron in the Princess Royal 
of 90 guns, accompanied by the Culloden, Capt. Balfour of 74, had arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, according to 
the Gazette of that place ; but I believe the truth was, 
that they only arrived off the Hook. They are since 
arrived at Newport where they are refitting. It is 
probable that the Princess Royal could not get into 
port at N. York, without taking out the greatest part 
of her artillery. Accounts from various quarters in 
form us, that Lord Howe is preparing for England, 
and that Admiral Byron will take the command. 
</p><p>
The arrival of the August packet will in all probability determine his operations. The sickly state of 
his crews, and the damage which his ships suffered in 
the storm, have rendered him inactive here till the 
opportunity is lost for the only enterprise which re 
mains for the enemy's combined land and naval force 
in America. 
</p><p>
Nothing remains for them, but to render the 
garrisons of <a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a> respectable (at 
the latter place, the seventieth regiment, the Duke 
of Hamilton's and the Duke of Argyle's highland 
men, according to the N. York paper, have arrived), 
to evacuate <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and Rhode Island, and 
withdraw the flower of the whole British infantry, 
which in their present situation are useless as to the 
general operations of the war. The French have 
more troops in the West India islands, than are necessary for a mere defensive plan. Their magazines are 
well furnished; the British 011 their parts are weak 
in both these respects in that quarter, and I am convinced that the slightest demonstration there, would 
occasion the immediate removal of General Clinton's 
army. Some think that the British will keep possession of N. York and Rhode Island, to enable them to 
make better terms. 
</p><p>
There is field for conjecture; the British may at 
this moment be attempting a negotiation with France. 
It can be neither her interest nor inclination to sacrifice her ally ; a general peace in this case would be 
the consequence. But accident or the caprice of a 
minister may disappoint the most rational predictions, 
and give rise to events which, at present, appear the 
most improbable. 
</p><p>
An unlucky affray has happened at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> which 
gives us the deepest concern. We are not acquainted 
with particulars any farther than that a quarrel arose 
between some American and French sailors. They 
proceeded from harsh words to more dangerous blows. 
Two valuable French officers who attempted to quell 
the riot were much abused, and one of them, the 
Count de's Sauveur it is feared will not recover. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Greene</a> informs us that the matter has been 
generally traced and found to originate with the Convention troops. The sailors who were the immediate 
</p><p>
instruments were Britons in the privateer service. If this is not strictly true, it is a story which policy w'd encourage. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Greene</a> in his first letter on the subject informs us that the French officers seemed satisfied that the 
mischief had been planned by some artful hand in Burgoyne's army, but he since tells us that there are jealousies on the subject. 
</p><p>
I saw very plainly when I was at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, that our antient hereditary prejudices were very far from being eradicated. 
</p><p>
A sergeant major who deserted from the 2 d batallion 
of Highlanders gives Gen'l Scott the following intelligence. That the 1'st and 2 d British brigade had 
received orders to hold themselves in readiness for 
embarking for the "W". Indies ; that the transports are 
lying in readiness to take them on board; he has 
heard officers say that <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> is to be evacuated. 
Another deserter asserts that four regiments are 
already embarked, and that the horse transports as 
well as others are ordered to prepare for sea. 
</p><p>
I omitted to mention to you that Lord Howe was 
on board a frigate during the whole time that Count D'Estaing gave him chase. This is a privilege allowed to admirals for their personal security, and is 
analagous to a general's placing himself on a safe eminence to view an engagement, but it could only be used 
in a desperate case, and by a man of Lord Howe's established reputation. 
For want of time to arrange my ideas, I have written you a chaos of intelligence, which I fear you. will hardly be able to reduce to any kind of order. 
</p><p>
You will not, I hope, quit <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> immediately 
after the first of next month. A few days more must 
develop the enemy's intentions, and may give me an 
opportunity of obtaining a furlough, at a time when it 
will not be dishonourable to take one. The campaign 
in all probability will terminate very insipidly, by the 
evacuation of N. York and Rhode Island, and I shall 
have time enough to rejoin the army for the Canadian 
expedition if it should take place. 
</p><p>
Anticipating the happiness which I shall enjoy in 
embracing you, I commend myself to your love, and 
my dear father to God's protection.

Gen'l Scott informs us that a party of the enemy have advanced on this side Kingsbridge. Another 
party have landed at Paulus Hook and advanced beyond Bergen. From the description, they are strong 
foraging parties, and design to glean the county previous to taking leave. Our General has given 
orders to parry any stroke which they may meditate against our posts in the highlands, tho the 
possibility of such an enterprise is exceedingly remote, and their dispositions in this case would be void of common sense.

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
The M. de Lafayette will not long have delayed 
after his arrival to open to you a plan for introducing 
French troops into Canada. From the manner in 
which he explained himself to the General, he seemed 
to intimate a desire that Congress w'd solicit him to 
bring about this business, as being sensible of its 
utility to the United States. He did not expect to 
succeed in any other way than by intrigues, petticoat 
interest, &ca. He lays down as self-evident that 
Canada cannot be conquered by American forces 
alone ; that a Frenchman of birth and distinction at 
the head of four thousand of his countrymen, and 
speaking in the name of the Grand Monarque is alone 
capable of producing a revolution in that country. 
When he asked my opinion privately on the subject, 
and asked me what I would say if I were a member 
of Congress to such a proposition, I replied that I did 
not think Congress could solicit, or even accept it, 
because there did not appear a sufficient reciprocity 
in the benefits to be derived from such an expedition. 
On the one side there would be an immense expense 
of transporting troops, loss of valuable officers and 
soldiers, &ca., in fine, all the disadvantages, and on 
the other, all the gain. That he did well to say the 
project could only take place by indirect means, for 
a minister would not in his cool moments deprive his 
country of so many troops, with no other view than 
that of killing so many Englishmen, and conquering 
an extensive province for us ; that he was to reflect 
that France, tho powerful in men, had an extensive 
frontier to guard, and in an European war w'd not have 
to do with England alone. This was my private 
opinion to the Marquis ; my still more private opinion is, that we sh'd not give France any new pretensions to Canada. It is a delicate subject to touch on, 
but I dare say that we agree in our sentiments, and 
that the Marquis will be thanked for his good intentions, and his offers waived. 
</p><p>
Our last intelligence, from deserters belonging to 
different corps, and who came out at different times, 
confirms the intended embarkation of ten regiments 
for the W. Indies. The 10th 45th and 52 d they say, 
were drafted to complete these regiments, and the 
forage and live stock collected in Jersey are destined 
for their use. 
</p><p>
Gen'l Scott writes that the enemy are very busy in 
embarking baggage, as may be discovered from an 
eminence to which his parties go. 
</p><p>
You will see the last unavailing effort of the com 
missioners in their manifesto. 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate 
</p><p>

My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I should have been glad to have accompanied Mr Custis, <a href='/results.php?tla=' rel=''>Mrs Washington</a>'s son, who is so kind as to 
take charge of this; but I cannot be ready in less 
than a week or ten days. 
</p><p>
The late bad weather drove that detachment of the enemy, that was posted on Valentine's hill, into the city, and they now coniine themselves within Kingsbridge. 
The detachment in Jersey from which there are daily 
desertions of two or three, have not yet returned ; but 
they have contracted themselves, and seemed to be 
wholly employed in collecting and carrying off their 
spoil. Deserters inform us that they have indiscriminately taken every kind of grain, Indian corn, stock 
and all. One of the vessels burnt by our parties, had 
stalls fitted up for twelve horses, and ample provision of water for a sea voyage. "We have repeated 
accounts of the sickliness of Byron's crews. The 
report of their disorder being contagious is without 
foundation, as well as that of the British fleets having 
put to sea in quest of the French. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a> who arrived in camp yesterday, 
gives us an account of Captain Barry's having lost his 
frigate two days after he sailed from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. He 
engaged a British 32 gun frigate and had fought her 
with his usual bravery, and great prospect of success ; 
his men and officers being sworn not to surrender; 
when a 64 gun ship came up and put an end to the 
contest; but not before he had given two or three 
such fires as Barry's situation, relatively to the British 
frigate, allowed. Our brave captain then avoided violating his oath by running his ship on shoar at Seal 
island, and keeping up a fire from four guns which he 
brought to bear in his stern, till he got out his boats 
and some baggage. He made his escape with eighty 
hands ; the rest were to shift for themselves by land 
ing. Ten who concealed themselves have escaped 
since; one, an Englishman, remained on board and 
extinguished the fire which Barry put to the ship in 
order to destroy her, by which means she was saved, 
and the enemy got her oft . 
</p><p>
If the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> goes to Europe, it is 
probable that he will take a great many of his countrymen with him. It is almost certain that many of 
them will be very troublesome to Congress for certificates. Duplessis applied to me the other day to 
obtain him a furlough for <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and to give 
him a certificate of his having behaved well at the 
battle of Monmouth, that he might go and signify his 
design to Congress of retiring from service. 
</p><p>
I replied that he had no need of an introduction to 
the President if he had any business with Congress, 
that he already had a most honourable certificate 
from them, and that if he wanted a final certificate at 
going away, the Commander in chief was the proper person to apply to. The commissions which Congress 
have applied so liberally have destroyed the value of 
rank which is the ostensible reward of merit, and 
have done great injustice to many brave and experienced officers who have found themselves on a par 
with, or but one remove from some of their country 
men who had no pretensions to rank of any kind. 
The only reparation that can be made, and it is but a 
feeble one, is to be sparing in the testimonials to be 
given at their departure, and to make a pointed difference between those which are given to men of real 
merit, and those which are the effect only of political management. 
</p><p>
You will be so good as to excuse my mentioning 
these matters ; they have occasioned great disgust in 
foreigners conscious of their worth, much uneasiness 
in our native officers, and have brought rank into 
disgrace. In a few days I shall have an opportunity 
of speaking more fully on this subject and many 
others if you permit, when I have the happiness of 
embracing you in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. I am anxious to receive a letter from you in the meantime, and begin to 
count the hours which are to precede my setting out. 
</p><p>
My dearest friend and father, 
</p><p>
Adieu.

The purchasing commissioners complain of the 
scarcity of Hour. Some persons high in public office, 
are accused of the detestable crime of monopolizing. 
Is there no means of bringing their villainy to light, 
and expelling them from all share of the people's 
confidence.
