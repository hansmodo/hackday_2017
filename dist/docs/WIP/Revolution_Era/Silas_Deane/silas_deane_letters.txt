I wrote you every material occurrence to the time of my leaving Bordeaux, and sent duplicates by Captains Palmer, 
Bunker, and Seaver, one of which you will undoubtedly have received, before this comes to hand. I left that city 
on the last of June, and arrived here the Saturday following, having carefully attended to every thing in the manufacturing or commercial towns in my way, which, indeed, 
are neither numerous nor of great consequence. I spent at Angouleme a day in viewing what, as to manufactures alone, 
deserves attention on the journey ; the foundery for cannon, where the greatest part of those used in the kingdom are 
manufactured. The cannon are cast solid, after which they 
are put as in a turner's lathe, and bored out, and the outside smoothed and turned at pleasure ; they can bore and 
complete a twelve pounder in one day in each lathe, which takes four men only to work ; the workmen freely showed 
me every part of their furnace and foundery. On Monday after my arrival, I waited on my bankers, and found that 
Mr Bancroft had arrived the same day with me, Mr Thomas Morris and M. Venzonals about ten days before. I 
waited on M. Dubourg and delivered him <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>'s letter, which gave the good gentleman the most sincere and real pleasure. 
</p><p>
M. Penet, on his arrival in Paris, waited on M. Dubourg, showed him a copy of his contract with the committee of 
Congress, and told him he had letters from <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> to him, but had left them on the road, or at Rotterdam, through 
fear of a search ; he told M. Dubourg, to whom he was a perfect stranger, so many particular circumstances, that he 
could not doubt of his sincerity, and in consequence he embarked in his affairs to a large amount. Five or six 
weeks have now passed without the arrival of the letters said to be left on the road. Arms, powder, Sec. to a large 
sum were in readiness, when my arrival gave him confidence, that I would take the burden off him, as he doubted 
not that my credentials would be explicit. I saw immediately the arrangement of the whole, and that M. Penet 
had returned to France, (copy of the contract excepted,) almost as empty handed as he came to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, yet 
had found means to collect a very considerable quantity of stores, part of which he had actually shipped. This circumstance gave me hopes, yet I found that it would now be 
expected I should become responsible for the articles, which embarrassed me much, since to detain them would 
be quite disagreeable, and to step out of my own line and involve myself with Messrs Plairne and Penet's contract, would be equally so. 
</p><p>
M. Penet had somehow got intelligence of my being in France, and that I was expected at Paris ; he, therefore, 
waited for me, and I saw him the next day at my hotel, when he complained of want of remittances, and desired 
me to pledge my credit for the stores, which I waived in the best manner I could, for I saw the consequences might involve me in many difficulties, and frustrate my greater 
designs. I, therefore, told him I would certify to the merchants, if necessary, that the Congress would pay for 
whatever stores they would credit them with, and in the mean time, advised him to proceed strictly agreeable to the 
letter of the contract, and I was positive that the Congress would fulfil their part of it. I fully satisfied both him and 
M. Dubourg, and he parted for Nantes to ship the goods the next day. I must do him the justice that is his due ; 
he has been indefatigable in the business, his heart seems to be entirely in it, and I believe him honest, but his connexions either commercial or political are not, of themselves, equal to such an undertaking, but the cause he was 
employed in, had, in a great measure, I found, supplied this deficiency, which was to me a favorable appearance. 
M. Dubourg told me that the ministers would not see me, as they meant to be quite secret in any countenance 
they gave the United Colonies, and that my arrival in France was already known in London, in consequence of 
which Lord Stormont arrived express but a few days before, 
and had applied to the court on the subject. I showed him 
my commission, and told him I was determined to apply ; 
for every circumstance, in my opinion, was favorable instead 
of otherwise. On this he wrote a letter to Count de Vergennes, asking liberty to introduce me the Thursday following, on which day I went to Versailles, and though the letter had not been delivered to his excellency, yet he gave us 
immediate admission. Fortunately his chief secretary 
spoke English well, by which means I had an opportunity 
of conversing freely with him on the subject of my commission for two hours, and was attentively and favorably 
heard by him, and was asked many questions, which shows 
that the American disputes had been, and still were a principal object of attention. I pursued nearly the line marked out 
by my instructions, stating the importance of the American 
commerce and the advantages Great Britain had received 
from a monopoly of it. That all intercourse ceasing between 
the two countries the Colonies had considered where they 
might dispose of that produce, which they necessarily had 
so large a surplus of, and receive for their raw or first materials the various manufactures they wanted. That they 
first turned their eyes on France, as the best country in 
Europe for them to be connected with in commerce. 
That I was purchasing a large quantity of manufactures for 
which I expected to pay the money, and that I should want a quantity of military stores, for which remittances would 
be made. That I doubted not the Colonies had before this declared independency, and that I should soon receive 
instructions in consequence, more full and explicit ; ilnit in the mean time they were very anxious to know how such a 
declaration would he received by the powers in Europe, particularly by France, and whether, in such case, an ambassador would be received from them, &.c. 
</p><p>
To which he replied, that the importance of the American commerce was well known, and that no country could 
so well supply the Colonies, and in return receive their produce as France ; it was, therefore, the interest of both to 
have the most free and uninterrupted intercourse, for which reason the court had ordered their ports to be kept open, 
and equally free to America, as to Britain. That, considering the good understanding between the two courts of 
Versailles and London, they could not openly encourage the shipping of warlike stores, but no obstruction of any kind 
would be given ; if there should, as the custom houses were not fully in their secrets in this matter, such obstructions should be removed, on the first application. That I 
must consider myself perfectly free to carry on any kind of commerce in the kingdom, which any subject of any other 
state in the world might, as the court had resolved their ports should be equally free to both parties. That I was 
under his immediate protection, and should I meet with any 
difficulty, either from their police, with the rules of which he supposed me unacquainted, or from any other quarter, 
I had but to apply to him and every thing should be settled. That as to independency, it was an event in the womb of 
time, and it would be highly improper for him to say any thing on that subject, until it had actually taken place ; mean 
time he informed me, thai the British ambassador knew of my arrival, a;id therefore advised me not to associate with 
Englishmen, more than I was from necessity obliged; as he doubted not I should have many spies on my conduct. 
</p><p>
I then told him the precautions I had taken and should 
persevere in, in coming from Bermuda, and that I did not 
mean in public to pass for other than a merchant from that 
island, on speculation, during the present cessation of commerce in America ; but at the same time I told his excellency, that I was well assured it was known in London, that I 
was coming long before I arrived at Paris, and I doubted 
not, they conjectured my errand, but at the same time, I 
should take every precaution in my power ; and most sincerely thanked him for his protection and assistance so generously offered, which he might depend I would never 
abuse. He was pleased with my having come by Bermuda, and passing as an inhabitant of that island, and said, if 
questioned, he should speak of me in that character. He 
then asked me many questions with respect to the Colonies, 
but what he seemed most to want to be assured of, was their 
ability to subsist without their fisheries, and under the interruption of their commerce. To this I replied, in this manner, that the fisheries were never carried on, but by a part 
of the Colonies, and by them, not so much as a means of subsistence, as of commerce. That the fishery failing, those 
formerly employed in them turned part to agriculture, and 
part to the army and navy. That our commerce must for 
sometime be in a great measure suspended, but that the 
greater part of our importations were far from being necessaries of life, consequently we should not suffer under the 
want of them, whilst it was not wealth or luxuries that we were contending for. That our commerce ceasing, it would 
be out of the power of our enemies to support themselves on 
our plunder and on the other hand, our ships, as privateers, might harass their commerce, without a possibility of their 
retaliating. That I hoped to see a considerable marine force in the Colonies, and that, joined to the impossibility of 
Britain's guarding so extensive a coast, would preserve some of our commerce, until it should be thought an object deserving the protection of other powers. 
</p><p>
After many questions on this subject, he put this, in which I thought he seemed interested, — whether, if the Colonies 
declare an independency, they would not differ among themselves ? To this I replied, that the greatest harmony 
had as yet subsisted, and I had no grounds to doubt it in future ; that the common danger, which first drove them into 
measures, which must end in such a declaration, would subsist, and that alone was sufficient to ensure their union. 
</p><p>
He then desired me to give his secretary my address, and said, though he should be glad to see me often, yet as 
matters were circumstanced, his house was too public a place but that I might put the same confidence in his secretary as himself, to whom I might apply for advice and direction, but that whenever any thing of importance occurred, I need but inform him, and he would see me ; but on 
common occasions, I must address the secretary, which would be every way more convenient as he understood the 
English language well, and was a person in whom the greatest confidence could be placed. Having settled the mode 
of intercourse, I expressed the sense I had of his excellency's politeness, and the generous protection he had given 
me, and on parting said, if my commission or the mode of introducing the subject were out of the usual course, I must 
rely on his goodness to make allowances for a new formed people, in circumstances altogether unprecedented, and for 
their agent wholly unacquainted with courts. To which he replied, that the people and their cause were very respectable in the eyes of all disinterested persons, and that the interview had been agreeable. 
</p><p>
After this I returned to Paris with M. Dubourg, whose 
zeal for the American cause led him to draw the most 
favorable consequences from this beginning. The next day 
while from home I was informed that count Laureguais had 
inquired out my lodgings, immediately after which he asked 
leave to go for England, which was refused him by the 
court. The same day I was informed that Sir Hans Stanley and Sir Charles Jenkinson, who I knew were at Boidcaux when I left it, were in France, for the sole purpose of' 
inquiring what agents were here from the Colonies, and 
what commerce or other negotiation between diem and the 
Colonies was carrying on. This alarmed ray friends, and 
as I had agreed for other lodgings, to which I was next day 
to remove, M. Dubourg advised me to secrete both, my 
lodgings and name. I told him that the count Laureguais' conduct appeared mysterious, yet I could never think 
of keeping myself secret, for though I should not seek these 
gentlemen, nor throw myself purposely in their way, yet I 
must think it an ill compliment to Count Vergennes, to suppose after what had passed, that I was not on as good and 
safe footing in France, as they or any other gentleman could be. However, his uneasiness made him write to the Count 
what he had advised, who returned for answer, that such a step was both unnecessary and impolitic, as it would only 
strengthen suspicions by giving every thing an air of mystery, while there was not the least occasion for it. 
</p><p>
The next day I had a fresh conference with M. Dubourg, who brought me a number of memorials from officers and 
engineers offering their services in America ; some of whom, I believe, deserve the utmost encouragement ; but 
more of this hereafter. While I was casting in my mind, how best to improve the present favorable crisis for supplying the 
Colonies, Monsieur Beaumarchais made proposals for procuring whatever should be wanted, but in such a manner as 
was understood by M. Dubourg to amount to- a monopoly, which indeed was not his only objection, for Monsieur 
Beaumarchais, though confessedly a man of abilities, had always been a man of pleasure and never of business ; but 
as he was recommended by Count Vergennes, Dubourg could not avoid noticing him, but immediately expostulated 
with the Count in a letter, which brought on embarrassments no way favorable, and I saw that M. Dubourg was so far 
from sounding the views of his superior in this manoeuvre, that he was, with the best intentions in the world, in danger of counteracting his own wishes, the extent of which were, to obtain the supplies of merchants and manufacturers on the credit of the Colonies, in which the strictest 
punctuality and most scrupulous exactness would be necessary, and which under the present difficulties of remittance, 
I feared would not be lived up to. 
</p><p>
As I had learned, that in the late reform of the French army, they had shifted their arms for those of a lighter kind, 
the heavy ones, most of which were the same as new, to the amount of seventy or eighty thousands, lay useless in magazines, with other military stores, in some such proportion, I apprehended it no way impossible to come at a supply 
from hence, through the agency of some merchant, without the ministry being concerned in the matter. In such case 
the merchant would be accountable to the ministry, and the Colonies to the merchant, by which means a greater time 
of payment might be given, and more allowance in case of our being disappointed. With this in view I went to Versailles on Wednesday, the 17th, and waited on M. Gerard, 
first secretary of foreign affairs, and presented to him the enclosed memorial, which led to a very particular conversation on the affairs of America, and which I turned finally on this subject, to which he would not then give me 
any immediate answer, but promised me one in a day or two. Returning to town, I found Messrs Dubourg and 
Beaumarchais had a misunderstanding, the latter giving out that he could effect every thing we wished for, and the 
former, from the known circumstances of M. Beaumarchais, and his known carelessness in money matters, suspecting he 
could procure nothing, and the more so as he promised so largely. They parted much displeased with each other, 
and Mons. Beaumarchais went directly to Versailles. On M. Dubourg's coming and informing me what had passed, 
I immediately wrote to M. Gerard the enclosed letter, and in return was desired to come with M. Dubourg the next morning to Versailles. 
</p><p>
We went as desired, and after explaining many things to 
M. Gerard, had a conference with his excellency, from 
whom I had fresh assurances of the utmost freedom and 
protection in their ports and on their coasts ; that in one 
word, I might rely on whatever Mons. Beaumarchais should 
engage in the commercial way of supplies, which, indeed, 
was all I wished for, as I was on the safe side of the question, viz. on the receiving part. I communicated to his 
excellency that clause of my instructions for procuring 
arms, he. of which he asked a copy. I then informed 
him, that I considered the present as a most critical juncture of American affairs, that the campaign would undoubtedly be carried far into the winter, that supplies now shipped might arrive very seasonably in the fall to enable the 
Colonies to hold out the present campaign. He replied 
that no delay should be made by any obstruction of any 
officer, or others of the customs or police. He then told 
me that the Count Laureguais was, perhaps, a well meaning man, but not sufficiently discreet for such purposes as this ; that Mr Lee, meaning Mr Arthur Lee of London, 
had confided, he feared, too much in him, and wished me 
to caution him on the subject, and that if I would write to 
him, he would enclose it in a letter of his, by a courier 
that evening. I most readily embraced this safe way of 
corresponding, and sent a letter I had before written, with 
an addition on this subject, a copy of which is enclosed. I have thus given you the heads of my negotiation to this 
time, July 20th, and will not take up your time in making 
remarks on it, and the prospect before me, which are obvious ; but inform you of the plan I mean to pursue, in the 
execution of my commission, and hint some methods, by 
which I think I may be enabled to complete every part of 
it to your satisfaction, and the relief of my country, which 
is all my wish, and the extent of my most ambitious hopes. 
I go on the supposition of an actual unconditional independency, without which little can be effected publicly ; with 
it, almost every thing we can wish for. 
</p><p>
It is by no means probable that Europe will long remain 
in a state of peace ; the disputes between Portugal and 
Spain are on the point of producing an open rupture ; the 
former relies on England ; the latter will look to this kingdom, and has already applied to this Court on the subject. 
Nothing but the division of Poland has taken the king of 
Prussia's attention off from the injustice done him by Great 
Britain, at the close of the last war. He has now completed his part of that extraordinary work, and I am well 
informed, listens with pleasure to the dispute between the United Colonies and Great Britain. He is ambitious of 
becoming a maritime power, and is already in possession of the capital ports on the Baltic ; but without commerce it is 
impossible to effect the design, and no commerce can put 
him so directly in the road as the American. The consumption of coffee, sugar, and other West India productions, increases fast in the north of Europe, and it must be his interest, at least, to supply his own dominions. In 
case of a war in Europe, France, Spain and Prussia might be brought into one interest, and the emperor of Germany 
is too closely connected with his majesty of France to take part against them, after which Great Britain, having her 
whole force employed in America, there could be nothing 
on the one hand to prevent Spain and France from reducing Portugal to a submission to the former, nor from Prussia and France subduing and incorporating into their own dominions Hanover, and the other little mercenary electorates, which lie between them, and which for several centuries have been one principal cause of every war that has happened in Europe. 
</p><p>
With respect to Russia, it is as closely allied to Prussia, as to Great Britain, and may be expected to be master in 
the contest. Denmark and Sweden are a balance for each other, and opposites. Not to enlarge on this plan at present, 
I have only to suggest, that an application to the king of Prussia will do no harm, and may be attended with good 
and great consequences ; the Prussian ambassador at this court and at that of London may be sounded on the subject. 
But my powers and instructions arc so limited, that I can by no means take such a step ; yet when I see Great Britain exerting her whole force, and that of her allies, and courting every power in Europe to aid her, I can but wish 
she may be counteracted in her own system, and by having 
employ found for her in Europe, bring her to leave America 
in peace, and I think myself bound in duty to hint at what to 
me seems the most probable means. Dr Bancroft was full with me in this opinion. Mons. Chaumont, a very wealthy 
person, and intendant for providing clothes, &,c. he. for the French army, has offered me a credit on account of the 
Colonies, to the amount of one million of livres. which I have accepted. I ha\e in treaty another credit, which 
joined to this will purchase the articles directed in my instructions ; the credit will be until 1 May next, before which 
I hope remittances will be made. I have purchased of said M. Chaumont a quantity of saltpetre at ten sous, or five 
and one fourth per cent, in order that Captain Morgan might not return empty. 
</p><p>
As soon as I have given the orders for despatching him, and settled some other matters here, I design for Dunkirk 
to ship the Indian goods, which I hope may arrive in season for the winter supply, though I leave you to consider my 
situation with only about G or <a href='/results.php?year=7000'>7000</a> pounds to complete a contract of forty, and the bills for my private expenses being 
protested, obliged to support myself out of that capital, which I labor to do with all the economy in my power. Dr Bancroft is returned to London, and by him I wrote to Messr. Gamier, and agreed on a mode of correspondence. I think 
your remittances in armed vessels will be much the best 
method, and I have ordered Captain iNForgan's sloop to be 
armed, and should she arrive safe, recommend him, as one 
I am confident will serve the Colonies with great zeal and 
fidelity ; and I have had some experience of the goodness 
of his temper and his abilities. Mr Seymour, his mate, is 
also deserving of encouragement, as a good seaman and of 
undaunted resolution. I am not without hopes of obtaining 
liberty for the armed vessels of the United Colonies to dispose of their prizes in the ports of this kingdom, and also 
for arming and fitting out vessels of war directly from hence, 
but I will not venture on this until I see what effect my last 
memoir may have ; the substance of which is, to shew the 
danger to France and Spain, if they permit Great Britain 
to keep so enormous a force in America, and to recover the 
dominion of the Colonies ; also how fully it is in their power 
to prevent it, and by that means deprive Great Britain of 
the principal source of her wealth and force, even without 
hazarding a war of any consequence in point of danger. 
</p><p>
This memoir, which takes several sheets, I am unable to 
send you a copy of, as I have no one to assist me, and 
must make out several copies for the persons to whom they 
are to be delivered. I was directed to apply for arms and 
clothes for 25,000 men, and for 100 field pieces, with ammunition and stores in proportion. This I wished to get of the 
ministry direct, but they evaded it, and I am now in treaty 
for procuring them, through the agency of Mons. Chaumont and Mons. Beaumarchais, on a credit of eight months, 
from the time of their delivery. If I effect this, as I 
undoubtedly shall, I must rely on the remittances being 
made this fall and winter without fail, or the credit of the 
Colonies must suffer. If I can get the arms out of the 
magazines, and the field pieces here, I hope for a much longer credit ; but if we send to Sweden for the brass cannon, 
the credit will not be lengthened beyond that. Some new 
improvements have lately been made in this branch, consequently the cannon now manufactured will be preferable to 
those of former construction. Some engineers here assert, 
that iron is preferable to brass, that is, wrought iron, out of 
which the pieces may be made lighter, and to a better purpose. Considering the want of these pieces, and the plenty 
of iron in America, the experiment might, I think, be made 
without delay. I am still in hopes of procuring an admission of the article of tobacco directly from America, but 
the Farmers-General will not offer equivalent to the risk. 
</p><p>
Without intelligence from April to this time, leaves me 
quite uncertain and extremely anxious about the line of conduct now pursuing by Congress, and consequently I cannot, 
without further intelligence and instructions, proceed in 
my negotiation either with safety or honor. The resolution of Congress of the 15th of INlay, is not considered by 
the ministry as a declaration of independence, but only a 
previous step, and until this decisive step is taken, I can do 
little more to any purpose. This taken, I dare pledge myself, 
the United Colonies may obtain all the countenance and 
assistance they wish for, in the most open and public manner, and the most unlimited credit with the merchants of 
this kingdom ; I must therefore urge this measure, if not 
already taken, and that the declaration be in the most full 
and explicit terms. 
</p><p>
Merchants here would speculate deeply in the American trade, could they be insured at any premium within bounds. 
I wish to know if offices are already open, and I would suggest that if the Congress would take the insurance under 
their own direction, it would give it such a proportionably greater credit, that supplies would most certainly be obtained 
in plenty. I shall be able to procure a private interview with the Spanish Ambassador, and shall present him my 
memorial, and am in a train, which I think will carry it quite to the fountain head. 
</p><p>
Thus I have in a minute, possibly a tedious detail, mentioned every thing material on my mind, which has occurred since my arrival, and submit the whole to the wisdom 
and candor of the honorable Congress, observing that I had gone to the extent of my instructions, and though I 
have been successful beyond my expectations, yet I have but been laboring principally to set certain great wheels in 
motion, which still want something more decisive on my part, and I am confident of all that is wanting to set them so 
effectually moving, as to roll the burden and calamities of war from our doors back with aggravated ruin on its 
authors, which, if I can be the means of effecting, the world may bestow the rest of its honors on whom it pleases ; I 
shall be contented, the extent of my most ambitious hopes thus accomplished. 
</p><p>
I have now to urge a survey with respect to the contents of this letter ; more that is said in Congress transpires and 
crosses the Adantic, than you conceive of ; more than I can account for, without having uncharitable thoughts of individuals, still without fixing them on any one. I have written a short letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague'>Mr Jay</a> on common affairs, \ind have enclosed 
one to Mons. Longueville, which I pray may be forwarded ; the letter is from his friends here, who have heard of his 
being a prisoner somewhere in America. M. Dubourg has continued to render me every assistance in his power ; to be 
particular would swell this letter beyond all bounds ; his 
abilities and connexions are of the first style in this kingdom, and his zeal for the cause of the United Colonies is to 
be described only by saying, that at times it is in danger of urging him beyond both ; in short, I am every way deeply 
indebted to him, personally for bringing me acquainted with agreeable persons of rank and character, and on account of 
my honored constituents, for assisting me to make such a favorable beginning and progress in my business. I know 
not how affluent he may be, but as he has really for some time devoted himself to assist in this negotiation, I am confident something honorable will be thought of for him. I have complimented him by asking of him his portrait to be 
sent to his and my friends in America, in my private capacity, mentioning our mutual friend <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>. This I 
found so agreeable, that I am confident some such distinction would be more acceptable than more lucrative rewards. 
Dr B. took pains to collect all the political publications of the last year for me and brought them with him ; he was at 
considerable expense in his journey ; I sent him from Bordeaux a bill of £30, and paid his expenses in my lodgings here ; at parting I desired him to keep an account, and when the money was expended to inform me. This gentleman is certainly capable of giving as good, if not the best 
intelligence of any man in Great Britain, as he is closely connected with the most respectable of the minority in both 
houses, not particularly obnoxious to the majority, and for his abilities, they are too well known to <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> to need 
any attempt to do them justice in a letter. I am. with the highest esteem and respect for the honorable Congress and 
their Committee of Secret Correspondence, &:c. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=sid" rel="me">SILAS DEANE</a>.
</p><p>
August 1st. — Since writing the foregoing I have been at and am of opinion, that a war between Portugal 
and Spain is at the door, and I have had an interview proposed with the ambassador of Portugal, who resides here on commercial affairs, which I have most readily embraced, and expect to see him again on Wednesday next, after 
which I will write you further ; his proposals are merely commercial, as is his station, hut something else may be investigated. 
</p><p>
August 21st. — I should have sent this off earlier, but delayed on account of hearing something more directly ; 
if I might depend on certain articles for which I was in treaty, I am now assured I may, and the whole will be ready 
to ship in all the month of October. My next labor will be to obtain a convoy, which I do not despair of, though 
it is a delicate question, and I have only sounded at a distance, yet I have no doubt of obtaining one, at least, off the 
coast of Europe, and the articles will be shipped as for die West India islands. I propose arming and well manning 
the vessels in which these articles shall be embarked, and I advise again the sending all remittances to Europe in armed 
vessels ; the probability of meeting with English merchants is well worth the risk. I hope that it will be considered 
that 100 field pieces, and arms, clothing and accoutrements, with military stores for 25,000 men, is a large affair ; and 
that although I am promised any credit, yet as they must be paid for, the sooner the better, if to be done without too great a risk. 
</p><p>
A considerable part of these articles are now on hand, and orders are issued for the others by the contractors this 
day. I prefer Bordeaux to any other port for shipping them from, but the remittances must be made to several, on which 
I will give you my opinion in my next. A number of gentlemen of rank and fortune, who have seen service, and 
have good characters, are desirous of serving the United Colonics, and have applied ; pray let me have orders on 
this subject ; if it be politic to interest this kingdom in the present contest, what way so effectual as to get into their 
debt for supplies, and employ persons of good family and 
connexions in it, in our service ? I have given encouragement, on which some are prepared to embark. One Mons. C. a celebrated engineer, who was chief in that way in the 
Turkish army, is returned, and is willing to go to America, 
but the ministry cannot as yet spare him, as certain regulations are making elsewhere ; possibly he may go out sometime in the winter ; he is a first character in his profession and otherwise. Indeed, this contention has set on foot such 
a spirit of inquiry in Europe into the state of America, that I am convinced that at the first close of this war, if, as I 
trust in God, it will close in our favor, there will be an inundation of inhabitants from this side of the globe. Many 
persons of capital fortunes have declared to me their resolution of moving to America, as soon as the liberties of 
America shall be established, and that many of their friends will accompany them.
</p><p>
August 15th. — I received from a friend at Amsterdam, a letter informing me that he would be with me on the JOtl),and 
as the vessel could not be sooner ready to sail, I determined not to risk this packet by a private hand, or by the public 
post; he is now arrived and takes charge of it in person. Were it possible, I would attempt to paint to you the heart 
rending anxiety I have suffered in this time, through a total want of intelligence ; ray arrival here, my name, my lodgings, and many other particulars have been reported to the 
British administration, on which they sent orders to the British ambassador to remonstrate in high terms, and to enforce 
their remonstrances, despatched Wedderburn from London, 
and Lord Rochford from Holland, as a person of great interest and address here to counteract me. They have been 
some time here, and the city swarms with Englishmen, and as money purchases every thing in this country, I have had 
and still have a most difficult task to avoid their machinations. 
Not a coffee-house or theatre, or other place of public diversion, but swarms with their emissaries; but knowing the ministry are my friends, I attend these places as others, but cautiously avoid saying a word on American affairs any where, except in my own hotel or those of my intimate friends. . 
</p><p>
I have seen many more of the persons in power in this time, and had long conversations with them ; their intentions are 
good and they appear convinced but there is wanting a great and daring genius at their head, which the Count Maurepas is very far from being ; he has even imbibed a 
notion, that no assistance is necessary, as the Colonies are too powerful for Great Britain. All eyes are turned on the 
Due de Choiseul. I am convinced the moment he comes into office, an active, open, and . will be taken. I think he will be minister very soon ; meantime I 
have nothing to complain of the 
</p><p>
Indeed they will not be ahered if he takes the lead. I find M. Beauraarchais, as I before hinted, possesses the entire confidence of the ministry ; he is a man of wit and genius, and a considerable writer on comic and political subjects ; all my supplies are to come through his hands, which 
at first greatly discouraged my friends, knowing him to be a person of no interest with the merchants, but had I been as 
doubtful as they, I could not have stepped aside from the path so cordially marked out for me by those I depend on. 
M. Coudray, the engineer I before hinted at, obtained liberty last week to go for America with as many engineers as he 
should choose, and was not only assured of M. Beaumarchais being able to procure the stores he had stipulated for, but 
received orders for them, and liberty to take 200 pieces of brass cannon, lest part might be intercepted. M. Coudray 
has the character of the first engineer in the kingdom, and his manners and disposition will, I am confident, be highly 
pleasing to you, as he is a plain, modest, active, sensible man, perfectly averse to frippery and parade. My friends 
here rejoice at the acquisition, and considering the character of the man, and at whose hands I in effect received 
him, I must congratulate you on it. Several young gentlemen of fortune, whose families are nearly connected with 
the Court, are preparing to embark for America, by each of whom I shall without disguise, write you the characters they sustain here ; I have told them that merit is the 
sole object with the Congress. The bearer can give 
you some idea of the situation I am in, should this packet fail, and should he arrive with it he may explain some 
part of it. I am confident his attention to the affairs of America here will be considered by the Congress; I 
have found him in the mercantile way active and intelligent. 
Mr Carmichael is now with me from Maryland, and I find him a person of great merit. Respecting the Colonies he is recommended such by from whom be has 
received a letter but of no immediate importance ; he proposes seeing me here this month. M. Dumas has written 
me two letters from the Hague, but so timid that he has not 
ventured to sign either, though he speaks in the highest terms of the American cause. The pamphlet called Common Sense has been translated, and has a greater run, if 
possible, here than in America. A person of distinction 
writing to his noble friend in office, has these words ; — " Je 
pease comme vous, raon cher Compte, que le Common 
Sense est une excellente ouvrage, at que son auteur est un 
des plus grands legislateurs des millions d'ecrivains, que 
nous connoissions ; il n' est pas douteux, que si les Americains suivent le beau plan, que leur compatriote leur a trace, 
iis deviendront la nation la plus florissante et la plus heureuse, qui ait jamais existe." 
</p><p>
Thus freely do men think and write in a country long since deprived of the essentials of liberty ; as I was favored 
with a sight of the letter, and permitted to make this extract, I thought it worth sending you as a key to the sentiments 
of some of the leading men. I must again remind you of 
ray situation here ; the bills designed for my use are protested, and expenses rising fast in consequence of the business on my hands, which I may on no account neglect, and a small douceur, though I have been sparing in that way, is 
sometimes of the utmost importance. The quantity of stores to be shipped will amount to a large sum, the very 
charge on them will be great, for which I am the only responsible person. Five vessels arrived from America 
with fish, which is a prohibited article, and the officers of the customs detained them, on which I was sent to and 
informed, that if those vessels came from the Congress to me, they should be permitted to unload and sell. Here 
was a difficulty indeed, for the Captain had not so much as applied to me by letter ; however, I assured die that 
there could be no doubt but they were designed for that use, and that the letters to me must have miscarried, on 
which orders were issued for unloading and storing those cargoes until further intelligence should arrive. I mention 
this case in confidence, and pray that in future some regulation may be made on this subject, and that vessels coming out may be directed to apply to uie as their agent or owner at least, and I will procure in the different ports 
houses of known reputation to transact their business. This is absolutely necessary, for by this means their articles may be admitted. Tobacco may come in this way, 
and every other article. deeply indebted ostensibly 
to M. Beaumarchais, he can obtain the liberty for the discharge of their debts. M. Coudray will see that the articles of ammunition, cannon, &:c. are provided in the best manner for the army, and will embark himself by the 1st of October. 
</p><p>
I wrote you from Bermuda on the subject of seizing and fortifying that island. I am well informed the British 
ministry have had it in contemplation, and propose doing it next spring. Mr Warder, of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, came a few 
days since from Bordeaux to Paris, and called on me with some young gentlemen from New England ; he brought 
letters from my good friends Messrs in consequence of letters to them from Mr Alsop. I received him as I do 
all ray countrymen, with real pleasure. A gentleman present warned him against conversing with a particular person 
in Paris, to which ]Mr VV. seemed to agree, yet I am told he went directly from my hotel to that person, and informed 
him of every thing he heard mentioned, and of every person he saw visiting me ; happily he could inform nothing of 
any consequence ; for my chamber was full of a mixed company, and the conversation was general and in French 
and in English ; but this conduct of his, with his want of common complaisance in leaving the city without calling 
on me to receive any letters I might have for London, which he had promised to convey, has given me some uneasiness, and I mention the incident only as a caution 
how and what persons are recommended. The pleasure I feel in seeing one of my countrymen is such, that I may 
be in as great danger from them as others, possibly much 
more. J should be unhappy if any suspicion should operate to the prejudice of this person without cause, but ray 
friends here, who are kindly attentive to every thing that is said or done which respects America, think very strange of his conduct. 
</p><p>
I rely on your indulgence for the length and incorrectness of this letter. I have had much on my hands, 
and no one to assist me in copying, &;c. Visits from persons to whom I cannot be denied, or visiting them, with constant applications made on various subjects, take up my mornings, and I have had only now and then an evening to write in. 
</p><p>
I have seen the prime agent, who proposed something in the way of supplying the Colonies with military stores from 
Prussia. I shall confer further on the subject with him 
and write you. I have drawn up a memorial on the commerce of America, and its importance to Europe, and shall 
present it tomorrow to the different personages concerned. I shall send a copy, if I can get one made, by this conveyance. The debt of the Colonies in carrying on the war is a common topic for ministerial writers, but permit me to 
assure you at the close of this long letter, that the demand for land in America, if its liberties are established, will more 
than compensate the whole expense, I will in a future letter be more explicit on this important subject, but am well 
convinced of the certainty of this fact, " that the advance 
in the price of lands in America, if the Colonies are victorious, will more than reimburse the expenses of the war." 
I have nothing material to add. Never were a people more anxious for news than the people of this kingdom are for 
news from America, and surely you will put me down as one of the first in the roll of American heroes, when 
you consider my situation, plunging into very important engagements, which I can by no means avoid, yet without 
funds to support them. But I will not enlarge on this subject, and only say, that I have met with every possible 
encouragement from every person I have seen, whether in or out of office, and I believe no person in the same space 
of time ever conferred with more of both. IMy being known to be an American, and supposed to be one of the 
Congress, and in business for the United Colonies, has introduced me beyond what almost any other recommendation could have done, which I mention to convince you of 
the attention paid here to the cause of the United Colonics, and how very popular it has become in this country. 
</p><p>
I have repeatedly seen Mr Hopkins, formerly of Maryland, now advanced to be a brigadier general in this service ; 
he talks of coming out to America ; should the Due de Choiseul, who is his friend and patron, come into the lead 
of administration, he might come out to advantage. Insurance from London to Jamaica is 20 per cent. If a few of 
our cruizers should venture on this coast they might do very well, as they would find protection in die harbors of 
this kingdom. Coming ostensibly for die purpose only of commerce or otherwise, no questions would be asked, and 
they might wait until an opportunity offered (of which they might be minutely informed,) and then strike something to 
the purpose. I give this hint to individuals, rather than to 
the honorable Congress as a body. The bearer, Mr Mc Creary, has obliged me by copying my memoir, which 
I send herewith. It has had a great run among the ministers of this and some other courts in a private way. M. 
Beaumarchais writes by this opportunity ; he has shown me 
his letter, and I have agreed in general to the contents, not 
understanding any exclusive privilege for his house. Every 
thing he says, writes, or does, is in reality the action of the 
ministry, for that a man should but a few months since confine himself from his creditors, and now on this occasion 
be able to advance half a million, is so extraordinary that 
it ceases to be a mystery. M. Coudray was not in the 
Turkish service as I was informed ; it was a gentleman 
who proposes accompanying him, but he is an officer of the 
first eminence, an adjutant general in the French service, 
and his prospects here of rising are exceeding good ; but 
he is dissatisfied with an idle life. His proposals in general 
have been, that he should be general of the artillery, and 
subject only to the orders of congress or their committee 
of war, or of their commander in chief of the army where 
he might be. In the next place, that he should rank as 
major general, and have the same wages, he. coming in as 
youngest major general for the present, and rising of course. 
Many other particulars are not yet adjusted, but considering the importance of having two hundred pieces of brass 
cannon, with every necessary article for twenty five thousand men, provided with an able and experienced general 
at the head of it, warranted by the minister of this court to 
be an able and faithful man, with a number of fine and spirited young officers in his train, and all without advancing 
one shilling, is too tempting on object for me to hesitate 
about, though I own there is a silence in my instructions. 
I therefore honestly declare, I am at your mercy in this 
case, and I have no uneasiness of mind on the occasion, 
for should I be sacrificed, it will be in that cause to which 
I have devoted my life and every in ii. The terms of M. Coudray may be thought high, but consider a person leaving a certain and permanent service and his native 
country, to go he hardly knows where, and it must be supposed he will ask at least as good terms as he could have 
in his own country, but as the terms have not been particularly considered, I must defer any thing further on this subject for the present, hourly in hopes of some explicit intelligence from the honorable Congress. You have the good 
wishes of every one here. Chevalier de Chastellier desires 
me this instant to write down his compliments to <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>, and with pleasure I say, the being known to be his 
friend, is one of the best recommendations a man can wish 
to have in France, and will introduce him when titles fail.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I was this morning informed of the arrival of Mr Arthur Lee, and that he would be in Paris tomorrow. This was 
surprising to me, as I knew of no particular affair that might call him here, and considering the extreme jealousy of the 
British Ministry at this time, and that Mr Lee was the agent of the United Colonies in Great Britain, and known to be 
such, I could wish, unless he had received some particular intelligence from the United Colonies, that he had suspended 
his visit, as I know not otherwise how he can serve me or my affairs, now (with the most grateful sense I mention it) 
in as favorable a course as the situation of the times will admit.

I have the honor to be, etc.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I shall send you in October clothing for 20,000 men, 30,000 fusils, 100 tons of powder, 200 brass cannon, 24 
brass mortars, with shells, shot, lead, he. in proportion. I am to advise you that if, in future, you will give commissions 
to seize Portuguese ships, you may depend on the friendship anti alliance of Spain. Let me urge this measure; much 
may be got, nothing can be lost by it. Increase at all events your navy. I will procure, if commissioned, any quantity 
of sailcloth and cordage. A general war is undoubtedly at hand in Europe, and consequently America will be safe, if 
you baffle the arts and arms of the two Howes through the summer. Every one here is in your favor. Adieu. I will write you again next week.

Sir, 
</p><p>
Yours of the 5th of June came to band on the 25th 
instant. Mr Delap will inform you of the state of remittances in his hands. Messrs Cliffords St Teysett, and Mr Hodgson of Amsterdam, have received next to nothing ; 
about two hundred pounds by the last accounts ; from which 
you will perceive that not one third of the sura proposed 
has come to hand, and even out of that my private expenses and those for promoting the other parts of my mission 
must take something, let me be ever so prudent and cautious. 
</p><p>
To solicit arms, clothing, and tents for thirty thousand 
men, two hundred brass cannon, mortars, and other stores 
in proportion, and to be destitute of one shilling of ready-money, exclusive of the fund of forty thousand pounds originally designed for other affairs, (which you know by the 
protests in London was my case) has left me in a critical 
situation. To let slip such an opportunity for want of ready 
money would be unpardonable, and yet that was taking out 
of a fund before deficient. I hope, however, to execute 
both, though not in the season I could have wished. I have, 
as you see, had but a few days since the receiving of yours, 
in which I have discoursed with some of the persons to 
whom [ had before proposed such a scheme, and think it 
will take well, but as men of property will be engaged in 
it, the remittances should be made very punctual. 
</p><p>
The insurance I am sensible had better be in Europe, 
but it cannot be had at present unless in Holland, where I 
am told there are often disputes with the underwriters. On 
the whole it must be done in America. I can, I believe, 
engage for one hundred thousand pounds sterling during 
the winter. I shall write to you further in a few days. 
</p><p>
You have mentioned to me a loan. I choose to speak of 
this in a letter of business particularly by itself, which I 
will endeavor to do by a young gentleman going on Sunday, to which opportunity I also refer what I have further 
to say on this subject. Pray forward the trifles I am sending to my little deserted family as soon as received. 
</p><p>
Tobacco is rising very fast, being now seven stivers in Holland. The scheme of the Farmers-General here is 
very artful ; they grow anxious. They held high terms on my first application. I turned off, and they are now applying to me, as are also some people further northward. 
</p><p>
God bless and prosper America is the prayer of every one here, to which I say Amen and Amen. 
</p><p>
I am, Sec.

</p><p>
Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
Mr Morris's letters of the 4th and 5th of June last, on 
politics and business, I received with the duplicates of my 
commission, and instructions on the 25th ult. I stand 
corrected and confine myself to politics. 
</p><p>
Your letter found me in a most critical situation ; the 
Ministry had become extremely uneasy at your absolute 
silence ; and the bold assertions of the British Ambassador, 
that you were accommodating matters, aided by the black 
and villainous artifices of one or two of our own countrymen 
here, had brought them to apprehend, not only a settlement 
between the two countries, but the most serious consequences 
to their West India Islands, should we unite again with Great 
Britain. For me, alas ! I had nothing left but to make the 
most positive assertions, that no accommodation would or 
could take place, and to pledge myself in the strongest possible manner, that thus would turn out the event, yet so 
strong were their apprehensions, that an order was issued to 
suspend furnishing me with stores. Think what I must feel 
upon such an occasion. Our friend, M. Beaumarchais, 
exerted himself, and in a day or two obtained the orders to 
be countermanded, and every thing is again running on favorably. For heaven's sake, if you moan to have any connexion with this kingdom, be more assiduous in getting your 
letters here. I know not where the blame lies, but it must lie heavy somewhere, when vessels are suffered to sail from 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> and other ports quite down to the middle of August, without a single line. This circumstance was urged 
against my assertions, and was near proving a mortal stab to 
my whole proceedings. One Mr Hopkins, of Maryland, in 
this service, and who is in the rank of Brigadier General, appeared desirous of going to America, but on my not paying 
him the regard he vainly thought himself entitled to, he 
formed the dark design of defeating at one stroke ray whole 
prospects as to supplies. At this critical period he pretended 
to be in my secrets, and roundly asserted that I had solely 
in view a reconciliation with Great Britain, immediately 
after which the stores now furnishing would be used against 
France. This coming from a professed enemy of Great 
Britain, from a native of America, from one who professed 
himself a zealous friend to the Colonies, you must suppose 
had weight. However thunderstruck I was, as well as my 
friend, M. Beaumarchais, at this unexpected and last effort 
of treachery, we exerted ourselves, and truth prevailed. 
The mischief has recoiled on himself, and having fallen into 
disgrace here, he will strive to get to America, where he 
threatens, I hear, to do much mischief to me. However, 
he will not probably be permitted to depart, unless he slips 
off very privately. Should that be the case, or should he 
write letters, you have now a clue to unravel him and his 
proceedings. 
</p><p>
It would be too tedious to recount what I have met with 
in this way. It has not only confined me to Paris, but to my 
chamber and pen for some weeks past in drawing up by 
way of memorial, the true state of the Colonies, their interests, the system of policy they must unquestionably pursue, 
and showing that the highest interests of France are inseparably connected therewith. I do not mention a single difficulty with one complaining thought for myself; my all is 
devoted, and I am happy in being so far successful, and that 
the machinations of my enemies, or rather the enemies of my 
country, have given me finally an opportunity of experiencing die friendship and protection of great and valuable men ; 
but it is necessary that you should know as much as possible 
of my situation. The stores are collecting, and I hope will 
be embarked by the middle of this month ; if later, I shall 
incline to send them by Martinique, on account of the season. 
It is consistent with a political letter to urge the remittance 
of the fourteen thousand hogsheads of tobacco written for 
formerly, in part payment of these stores ; if you make it 
twenty, the public will be the gainers, as the article is rising 
fast. You are desired by no means to forget Bermuda ; if 
you should. Great Britain will seize it this winter, or France 
on the first rupture, having been made sensible of its importance, by the officious zeal of that same JMr H. As your 
navy is increasing, will you commission me to send you 
duck for twenty or thirty sail ? I can procure it for you to 
the northward on very good terms, and you have on hand the produce wanted to pay for it with. Have you granted 
commissions against the Portuguese ? All the friends to America in Europe call loudly for such a measure. 
</p><p>
Would you have universal commerce, commission some 
person to visit every kingdom on the Continent, that can 
hold any commerce with America. Among them by no 
means forget Prussia. Grain will be in demand in this 
kingdom, and in the south of Europe. Permit me again to 
urge an increase of the navy. Great Britain is calling in 
her Mediterranean passes, to expose us to the Algerines. I 
propose applying to this Court on that subject. Doctor Bancroft, of London, merits much of the Colonies. As I shall 
now have frequent opportunities of writing by officers and others going out, I will not add more, than that Mr Carmichael has now been with me some time, recommended by 
Mr A. Lee, of London. I owe much to him for his assistance in my despatches, and for his friendly and seasonable 
advice upon all occasions. He is of Maryland, and is here 
for his health, and proposes going soon to America. I expect to hear from London tomorrow by Dr B. who is on 
his way here. 
</p><p>
I am, with my most sincere respect and esteem for the 
Secret Committee, and most profound regard to the Congress, your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=sid" rel="me">SILAS DEANE</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. An agent from Barbadoes is arrived in London to 
represent their distresses ; another from Bermuda with a 
declaration to the Ministry of the necessity of their being 
supplied with provisions from the Colonies, and saying that if not permitted they must ask the protection of 
Congress. 
</p><p>
I have to urge your sending to me, either a general power 
for the purpose, or a number of blank commissions for vessels 
of war. It is an object of the last importance, for in this time 
of peace between the nations of Europe, I can be acquainted 
with the time of every vessel's sailing, either from England or 
Portugal, and by despatching light vessels armed from 
hence, and to appearance property o{ the citizens of the 
United States of America, to seize them while unsuspicious 
on this coast, and to stand directly for America with them, 
great reprisals may be made ; and persons of the first property have already solicited me on the occasion. Indeed 
they have such an opinion of my power, that they have 
offered to engage in such an adventure, if I would authorise 
them with my name ; but this might as yet be rather dangerous ; it is certainly however a very practicable and safe plan 
to arm a ship here, as if for the coast of Africa or the West 
Indies, wait until some ship of value is sailing from England 
or Portugal, slip out at once and carry them on to America. 
When arrived the armed vessel increases your navy, and the 
prize supplies the country. 
</p><p>
It is of importance, as I have mentioned in my former letters, to have some one deputed and empowered to treat with 
the king of Prussia. I am acquainted with his agent here, and have already through him received some queries and 
proposals respecting American commerce, to which I am preparing a reply. I have also an acquaintance with the 
Agent of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who proposes fixing a commerce between the United States and Leghorn, but 
has not as yet given me his particular thoughts. France and Spain are naturally our allies; the Italian states want our flour and some other articles; Prussia, ever pursuing her own 
interests, needs but be informed of some facts relative to America's increasing commerce, to favor us ; Holland will 
pursue its system now fixed, of never quarreling with any one on any occasion whatever. In this view is seen at once the 
power we ought to apply to, and gain a good acquaintance with. Let me again urge you on the subject of tobacco. 
Receive also from me another hint. It is this ; if you would apportion a certain tract of the Western Lands, to be divided 
at the close of this war among the officers and soldiers serving in it, and make a generous allotment, it would I 
think have a good effect in America, as the poorest soldiers would then be fighting literally for a freehold; and in 
Europe it would operate beyond any pecuniary offers. I have no time to enlarge on the thought, but may take it up 
hereafter ; if I do not, it is an obvious one, and if capable of execution, you can manage it to the best advantage. 
</p><p>
I have no doubt but I can obtain a loan for the Colonies, if empowered, and on very favorable terms. I have 
already sounded on the subject, and will be more explicit hereafter, both as to my proposals, for I can go no further, 
and the answers I may receive.

</p><p>
Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
Your Declaration of the fourth of July last has given this Court, as well as several others in Europe, reason to expect 
you would in form announce your Independency to them, and ask their friendship ; but a three months' silence on that 
subject appears to them mysterious, and the more so as you declared for foreign alliances. This silence has again given me 
the most inexpressible anxiety, and has more than once come near frustrating my whole endeavors ; on which subject I 
refer you to mine of the first instant. Employment must be found for the forces of Great Britain out of the United States 
of North America. The Caribs in St Vincent, if set agoing, 
may be supplied through Martinique with stores. The Mountain negroes in Jamaica may employ a great number of their 
forces. This is not employing slaves, which, however, the 
example of our enemy authorises. Should there arise troubles in these two Islands, which a very little money would effect, the consequence would be, that Great Britain, which can 
by no means think of giving them up, would be so far from being able to increase her force on the continent, that she 
must withdraw a large part to defend her Islands. I find that every one here, who is acquainted with Bermuda, is in my 
sentiments ; and by the officiousness of H. the ministry here have got it by the end. This makes me the more solicitous, 
that the Island should be fortified this winter if practicable. 
Tobacco in Holland is at the enormous price of seven stivers, and will soon be as dear in France and Germany. 
I have promised that you will send out twenty thousand hogsheads this winter, in payment for the articles wanted 
here. Let me advise you to ship the whole to Bordeaux, after which it may be shipped in French bottoms to any 
other port ; the price will pay the convoy ; therefore I would 
recommend the vessels in which it should be shipped to be 
armed, and that each ship shall sail under convoy of one of 
your frigates, which may also be ballasted with it ; this will 
be safer than coming in a fleet. On their arrival, Messrs Delap, whose zeal and fidelity in our service are great, will 
be directed by me, or in my absence by Mons. B. or 
ostensibly by Messrs Hortalez and Co. where to apply the 
money. Eight or ten of your frigates, thus collected at 
Bordeaux, with a proper number of riflemen as marines, 
where they might have leisure to refit and procure supplies, 
would strike early next season a terrible blow to the British 
commerce in Europe, and obtain noble indemnity. The 
appearance of American cruisers in those seas has amazed 
the British merchants, and insurance will now be on the war 
establishment ; this will give the rival nations a great superiority in commerce, of which they cannot be insensible ; and as 
our vessels of war will be protected in the ports of France 
and Spain, the whole of the British commerce will be exposed. I hope to have a liberty for the disposal of prizes here, 
but dare not engage for that. The last season the whole 
coast of England, Scotland, and Ireland has been and still 
remains unguarded ; three or four frigates, arriving as they 
certainly might unexpectedly, would be sufficient to pillage 
port Glasgow or other western towns. The very alarm, 
which this would occasion, might have the most surprising 
and important effects, and in this method it might be effected 
with the utmost certainty if entered upon early next spring ; 
but should that be laid aside, the having five or six more of 
your stoutest ships in these ports, where you may every day 
receive intelligence of what is about to sail from England, 
would put it in our power to make great reprisals. 
</p><p>
I wrote for blank commissions, or a power to grant commissions to ships of war. Pray forward them, as here are 
many persons wishing for an opportunity of using them in 
this way. The granting commissions against Portugal would 
ensure the friendship of Spain. Grain will bear a great price 
in this kingdom and the south of Europe ; and I have made 
application to the minister of marine to supply masts and 
spars from America for the French navy. Pray inform me 
how, and on what terms the British navy formerly used to be 
supplyed from New England. I am fully of opinion, that a 
war must break out soon and become general in Europe. 
I need say no more on the situation I am in, for want of your 
further instructions. I live in hopes, but should I be much 
longer disappointed, the affairs I am upon, as well as my 
credit, must suffer, if not be absolutely ruined. My most 
respectful compliments to the Congress.

I am, gentlemen,

Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
I once more put pen to paper, not to attempt, what is 
absolutely beyond the power of language to paint, my distressed situation here, totally destitute of intelligence or 
instructions from you since I left America, except Mr Morris' 
letters of the 4th and 5th of June last, covering duplicates 
of my first instructions. Nor will I complain for myself, but 
must plainly inform you, that the cause of the United Colonies or United States has, for some time, suffered at this 
court for want of positive orders to me, or some other person. 
</p><p>
It has not suffered here only, but at several other courts, that are not only willing, but even desirous of assisting 
America. Common complaisance, say they, though they 
want none of our assistance, requires that they should announce to us inform their being Independent States, that we 
may know how to treat their subjects and their property in our dominions. Every excuse, which my barren invention 
could suggest, has been made, and I have presented memoir after memoir on the situation of American affairs, and their 
importance to this kingdom, and to some others. My representations, as well verbally as written, have been favorably 
received, and all the attention paid them I could have wished, but the sine qua non is wanting, — a power to treat from the 
United Independent States of America. How, say they, is it possible, that all your intelligence and instructions should 
be intercepted, when we daily have advice of American vessels arriving in different ports in Europe 9 It is true I have 
effected what nothing but the real desire this court has of giving aid could have brought about, but at the same time it 
has been a critical and delicate affair, and has required all 
attention to save appearances, and more than once have I been on the brink of losing all, from suspicions that you were 
not in earnest in making applications here. I will only add, that a vessel with a commission from the Congress has 
been detained in Bilboa as a pirate, and complaint against it carried to the court of Madrid. I have been applied to 
for assistance, and though I am in hopes nothing will be determined against us, yet I confess I tremble to think how 
important a question is by this step agitated, without anyone 
empowered to appear in a proper character and put in a defence. Could T present your Declaration of Independence, 
and shew my commission subsequently, empowering me to appear in your behalf, all might be concluded at once, and 
a most important point gained, — no less than that of obtaining a free reception, and defence or protection of our ships 
of war in these ports. 
</p><p>
I have written heretofore for twenty thousand hogsheads 
of tobacco. I now repeat my desire, and for a large quantity of rice. The very profits on a large quantity of these 
articles will go far towards an annual expense. The stores, concerning which I have repeatedly written to you, are now 
shipping, and will be with you I trust in January, as will the 
officers coming with them. I refer to your serious consideration the enclosed hints respecting a naval force in these 
seas, also the enclosed propositions which were by accident thrown in my way. If you shall judge them of any consequence you will lay them before Congress ; if not, postage will be all the expense extra. I believe they have been seen 
by other persons, and therefore I held it my duty to send them to you. My most profound respect and highest 
esteem ever attend the Congress, and particularly the Secret Committee. 
</p><p>
I am, Gentlemen, he. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=sid" rel="me">SILAS DEANE</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. Doctor Bancroft has been so kind as to pay me a 
second visit, and that most seasonably, as my former assistant Mr Carmichael has gone to Amsterdam, and thence 
northward on a particular affair of very great importance. The vessel referred to is commanded by Captain Lee, of 
<a href='/results.php?city=newburyport' rel='city'>Newburyport</a>, who on his passage took five prizes of value, and sent them back, but brought on two of die Captains and 
some of the men prisoners to Bilboa, where the Captains entered their protest, and complained against Captain Lee 
as a pirate, on which his vessel is detained, and his commission, &cc. sent up to Madrid. this instantly brings on a 
question, as to the legality of the commissions; if determined legal, a most important point is gained ; if the reverse, the 
consequences will be very bad, and the only ground on which the determination can go against the Captain, is that the 
United States of America, or their Congress, are not known in Europe, as being Independent States, otherwise than 
by common fame in newspapers, &:c. ; on which a serious resolution cannot be grounded. The best, therefore, that 
the Captain expects will be to get the matter delayed, which is very hard on the brave Captain and his honest owners, 
and will be a bad precedent for others, who may venture into the European seas. I have done every tiling in my power, 
and am in hopes from the strong assurances given me, that all will be settled to my satisfaction in this affair, but cannot 
but feel on the occasion as well for the Captain as for the public. I have been told repeatedly I was too anxious, and advised " rester sans inquietude," but I view this as a capital affair in its consequences, and though I wish it, I cannot take advice. 
</p><p>
Warlike preparations are daily making in this kingdom and in Spain ; in the latter immediately against the Portuguese, but they will most probably in their consequences 
involve other powers. I need not urge the importance of immediate remittances towards paying for the large quantity 
of stores I have engaged for, and depend this winter will not be suffered to slip away unimproved. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, fee.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since receiving yours of the 4th and 5th of August last, 
I have written you repeatedly, and have no doubt of your 
receipt of my letters, to which I refer you. You are in the 
neighborhood of St Vincents, and I learn that die Caribs 
are not contented with their masters, and being an artful as 
well as revengeful people, would undoubtedly take this opportunity of throwing off a yoke, which nothing but a superior force can keep on them. My request is, that you would 
inquire into the state of that island, by proper emissaries, and if the Caribs are disposed to revolt, encourage them and 
promise them aid of arms and ammunition. This must tear 
from Great Britain an island, which they value next to Jamaica, and to which indeed they have no title but what rests 
on violence and cruelty. At any rate they will oblige Great Britain to withdraw part of her forces from the continent. 
If any thing can be effected there, inform me instantly, and I will order to your care such a quantity of stores as you shall, think necessary. 
</p><p>
The enclosed letter I desire you to break the seal of, and make as many copies as there are vessels going northward, 
by which some one must arrive. A war I think may be depended upon, but keep your intelligence of every kind 
secret, save to those of the Secret Committee. 
</p><p>
You will send also a copy of this, by which the Committee will see the request I have made to you, and the 
reason of their receiving several duplicates in your handwriting. I wish you to forward the enclosed to Mr Tucker, 
of Bermuda, and write me by every vessel to Bordeaux or

Nantes.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received no letter from you since those of the 4th and 5th of August last, nor any intelligence from Congress 
since the 5th June, which not only surprises but distresses me. I now send to the care of Mons. Deant two hundred 
tons of a necessary article to be at your orders for use of the 
Congress ; the freight is to be paid in Martinique as customary, and I wish you to ship it for the ports of the Colonies, 
in such a manner, and in such quantities in a vessel, as you shall judge most prudent, advising the Congress of your 
having received it, and the methods you are taking to ship it to them, praying them to remit you the amount of the freight, 
as you must make friends in Martinique for advancing the same.

I wish you could write me oftener, and inform me very

Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
I have purchased two hundred tons of powder, and ordered the sarae to be shipped to Martinique to the care of Mons. Deant, to the direction of Mr Bingham for your use. The first cost is IS sols per lb. or lOd sterling ; the charges will 
be added ; the amount I have not as yet ascertained, and interest at five per cent until payment. I must again urge 
you to hasten your remittances. Tobacco, rice, indigo, wheat, and flour are in great demand, and must be so through 
the year. Tobacco is nine stivers per lb. in Holland, rice 50s sterling per cwt. Flour is already from 20 to 23 livres 
per cwt. and rising. I have engaged a sale for 20,000 hogsheads of tobacco, the amount of which will establish the 
credit of the Congress with the mercantile interest in France and Holland. 
</p><p>
Let me urge your attention to these articles, though I 
must say your silence ever since the 5th of last June discourages me at times. Indeed it well nigh distracts me. 
From whatever cause the silence has happened, it has greatly 
prejudiced the affairs of the United Colonies of America ; 
and so far as the success of our cause depended on the 
friendship and aid of powers on this side the globe, it has 
occasioned the greatest hazard and danger, and thrown me 
into a state of anxiety and perplexity, which, no words can 
express. I have made one excuse after another, until my 
invention is exhausted, and when I find vessels arriving from 
different ports in America, which sailed late in August, without a line for me, it gives our friends here apprehensions that 
the assertions of our enemies, who say you are negotiating and compounding, are true ; otherwise, say they, where are 
your letters and directions? Surely, they add, if the Colonies were in earnest, and unanimous in their Independence, 
even if they wanted no assistance from hence, common civility would cause them to announce in form their being Independent States. 
</p><p>
I will make no other comment on the distressing subject than this ; were there no hopes of obtaining assistance on 
application in a public manner, I should be easier under your silence, but when the reverse is the case, to lose the present 
critically favorable moment, and hazard thereby the ruin of the greatest cause in which mankind were ever engaged, 
distresses my soul, and I would if possible express something of what I have undergone for the last three months, until 
hope itself has almost deserted me. I do not complain for myself, but for my country, thus unaccountably suffering 
from I know not what causes. 
</p><p>
I am, gentlemen, with most respectful compliments to the Congress, &c.

</p><p>
Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
The only letters I have received from you were 4th and 5th of June last, five months ago, during which time vessels have arrived from almost every part of America to every part of France and Spain, and I am informed of letters from Mr Morris to his correspondents, dated late in July. If the 
Congress do not mean to apply for foreign alliances, let me entreat you to say so, and rescind your resolutions published 
on that head, which will he but justice to the powers of 
Europe, to whom you gave reason to expect such an application. If I am not the proper person to announce your Independency, and solicit in your behalf, let me entreat you to 
tell me so, and relieve me from an anxiety, which is become so intolerable that my life is a burthen. Two hundred pieces 
of brass cannon, and arms, tents and accoutrements for thirty thousand men, with ammunition in proportion, and between 
twenty and thirty brass mortars have been granted to my request, but the unaccountable silence on your part has delayed the embarkation some weeks already. I yesterday got 
them again in motion, and a part are already at Havre de Grace and Nantes, and the rest on their way thither, but I 
am hourly trembling for fear of counter orders. Had I received proper powers in season, this supply would before 
this have been in America, and that under the convoy of a strong fleet ; the disappointment is distracting, and I will 
dismiss the subject, after taking the liberty to which a freeman and an American is entitled, of declaring, that by this 
neglect the cause of the United States has suffered in this and the neighboring Courts, and the blood that will be spilt 
through the want of these supplies, and the devastation, if any, must be laid at this door. 
</p><p>
Captain Cochran having arrived at Nantes, I sent to him 
to come to me. He is now with me, and by him I send this 
with a packet of letters. He can inform you of the price of 
American produce in Europe, the very advance on which 
will pay you for fitting out a navy. Rice is from 30 to 50 
livres per cwt., tobacco 8d and 9d per lb., flour and wheat 
are growing scarce and rising, masts, spars, and other naval 
stores are in demand, and the more so as a war with Great 
Britain is considered as near at hand. 
Mons. du Coudray, who has the character of being one of 
the best officers of artillery in Europe, has been indefatigable 
in our service, and I hope the terms I have made with him 
will not be thought exorbitant, as he was a principal means 
of engaging the stores. The rage, as I may say, for entering into the American service increases, and the consequence 
is, that I am pressed with offers and proposals, many of 
them from persons of the first rank and eminence, in the sea 
as well as land service. Count Broglio, who commanded 
the army of France during the last war, did me the honor to 
call on me twice yesterday with an officer who served as his 
Quarter Master General the last war, and has now a regiment in this service, but being a German, and having travelled through America a few years since, he is desirous of 
engaging in the service of the United States of North America. I can by no means let slip an opportunity of engaging a 
person of so much experience, and who is by every one recommended as one of the bravest and most skilful officers in 
the kingdom, yet I am distressed on every such occasion for want of your particular instructions. This gentleman has an 
independent fortune, and a certain prospect of advancement here, but being a zealous friend to liberty, civil and religious, 
he is actuated by the most independent and generous principles in the offer he makes of his services to the States of 
America. 
</p><p>
Enclosed you have also the plan of a French naval officer for burning ships, which he gave me, and at the same time 
showed me his draughts of ships, and rates for constructing and regulating a navy, of which I have the highest opinion ; 
he has seen much service, is a person of study and letters, as 
well as fortune, and is ambitious of planning a navy for America, which shall at once be much cheaper and more 
effectual than any thing of the kind which can be produced on the European system. He has the command of a ship of 
the line in this service, but is rather disgusted at not having his proposed regulations for the navy of France attended to. 
His proposal generally is to build vessels something on the model of those designed by the Marine Committee, to carry 
from 24 to 36 heavy guns on one deck, which will be as formidable a battery as any ship of the line can avail itself of, 
and by fighting them on the upper deck a much surer one. Had I power to treat with this gentleman, I believe his 
character and friends are such, that he could have two or three such frigates immediately constructed here on credit 
and manned and sent to America, but the want of instruction, or intelligence, or remittances, with the late check on 
Long Island, has sunk our credit to nothing with individuals, 
and the goods for the Indian contract cannot be shipped, unless remittances are made to a much greater amount than at 
present. Not ten thousand pounds have been received for 
forty thousand delivered in America as early as last February, and I am ignorant what has become of the effects 
shipped. Under these circumstances I have no courage to urge a credit, which I have no prospect of supporting ; but I 
will take Mr Morris's hint, and write a letter solely on business ; but politics and my business are almost inseparably 
connected. I have filled this sheet, and will therefore bid you adieu until I begin another.

I have written to you often, and particularly of affairs here. The want of intelligence retards every thing ; as I have not a 
word from you since the 5th of June last, I am well nigh distracted. That I may not omit any chance of sending to 
you, I write this, though I have long and minute letters by me waiting the departure of General du Condray and 
his train, who, had I been properly and in season instructed, would before this have been with you. At present I have 
put much to the hazard to effect what I have. Enclosed you have my thoughts on naval operations, and I pray you 
send me some blank commissions, which will enable me to fit out privateers from hence without any charge to you. A 
war appears at hand, and will probably be general. All Europe have their eyes on the States of America, and are 
astonished to find month after month rolling away, without your applying to them in form. I hope such application is 
on its way. Nothing else is wanting to effect your utmost wishes. I am, with compliments to friends, and respect to the Congress, Sec.

Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
This serves only to enclose and explain the within State of the Commerce of Leghorn, which was given me by 
the Envoy of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, a gentleman of 
universal knowledge, and a warm friend to America, and indeed to all mankind. I have the honor of his acquaintance 
in an intimate degree, and have communicated to him a memoir, setting forth the particular state of the commerce of 
America, with the history of its rise and increase, and its present importance, it being a copy of what I delivered to 
this Court. He has marked the articles generally in demand, after which he enumerates their articles for exportation, 
which in my turn I marked and observed upon, as you will see. 
</p><p>
I have only to add, that the Grand Duke has taken off all 
duties on the American commerce, to give it encouragement. This indeed is done rather privately to prevent complaint of other powers of a seeming partiality. When I add 
to this, that it is agreed on all hands that ships of war may be purchased at Leghorn ready fitted for sea, cheaper than 
in any other port in Europe, I think a good acquaintance ought to be cultivated with this State. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, k.c.

Sir, 
</p><p>
The bearer, Mr Rogers, is a native of Maryland, whom I fortunately met in the hotel I some months lodged in. 
</p><p>
He was in Paris finishing his education, and by my advice accepted the office of aid-de-camp to Mons. du Coudray, and accompanies him out to America. I have received 
many kindnesses from him, and, confident of his integrity, have intrusted him with many things to relate to you viva voce, especially should my despatches fail. He has a general knowledge of the history of my proceedings, and what I 
have at times to struggle with. As he speaks French tolerably, he will I conceive prove a valuable acquisition, at a time 
when such numbers of foreigners are crowding to enter your 
service. 
</p><p>
I am, wishing him a speedy and safe arrival, with the 
most profound respect for the Congress, etc.

Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
In a former letter I mentioned a naval enterprise, which 
might at first appear romantic, but the more it is considered 
the less danger I shall be in of being taxed on that score. 
Admiral Montague lately returned from the Banks, where 
the fishermen have had a wretched season, in consequence 
of the American privateers. He left two small sloops of war 
there of 14 and 16 guns. In common years they leave six 
or seven thousand of their laborers or fishermen there, as in 
a prison, through the winter, employed in taking seals, 
repairing boats, stages, &c. ; these are unarmed, and ever 
dissatisfied to the last degree with their situation. Two 
frigates arriving early in February would destroy the fishery 
for one if not two years, and obtain an acquisition of a fine 
body of recruits for your navy. I have conferred with some 
persons here on the subject, who highly approve the enterprise, but I submit it to your opinion, after urging despatch 
in whatever is done or attempted on that subject. 
</p><p>
The resolution of the Court of Spain in the case of Capt. Lee, at Bilboa, gives every encouragement to adventurers 
in these seas, where the prizes are valuable, and where you 
have constantly harbors at hand on the coast of France and 
Spain to repair to and refit in, and where constant and certain intelligence can be had of the situation of the British 
ships of war, as well as of commerce. I need not add, on a 
subject so plain, and at the same time so important, but 
will only remind you that the Dutch, in the space of two or 
three years after their first revolt from Spain, attacked the 
Spaniards so successfully and unexpectedly in every quarter 
of the globe, that the treasures they obtained thereby enabled 
them to carry on the war. Let me repeat, that if you empower me or any other person here, you may obtain any 
number of ships of war on credit from individuals, on paying 
interest at five per cent until the principal is discharged. 
The Icing will probably have use for his, and besides, to let 
his go would be the same as a declaration of war, which in 
form at least will for some time be avoided.

Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 7th of August last, covering a copy of yours of the 8th of July, I received, though the original never 
came to hand. This letter also enclosed the Declaration of Independence, with instructions to make it known to this and 
the other powers of Europe ; and I received it the 7th inst. 
though the vessel which brought it had but 38 days passage 
from Salem. This letter was very far from relieving me, as 
it enclosed what had been circulated through Europe for two 
months before, and my pretending to inform this Court would 
be only a matter of form, in consequence of your orders, 
which were expressed in the style of any common affair. 
I certainly prefer simplicity of style, as well as manners, 
but something is due to the dignity of old and powerful states, 
or if you please to their prejudices in favor of long established form and etiquette ; and as the United States of 
America, by this act, introduce themselves among the established powers, and rank with them, it must of course be expected that at the first introduction, or the announcing of it, 
some mode more formal, or if I may so say, more respectful, 
would have been made use of, than simply two or three lines 
from the committee of congress, in a letter something more 
apparently authentic, not that either your power or the reality of your letter could be doubted. I mention it as deserving consideration, whether in your application here and 
your powers and instructions of a public nature, it is not 
always proper to use a seal ? This is a very ancient custom 
in all public and even private concerns of any consequence. 
Further, to keep a proper intercourse with Europe, it is 
by no means sufficient to write a single letter, and leave it to 
be forwarded when the captain of a vessel thinks of it, or has 
nothing else to do. Duplicates of every letter should be 
lodged in every port in the hands of faithful and attentive 
persons, to be forwarded by the first conveyance to any part 
of Europe. Had this been practised since my leaving America, instead of receiving but two short letters from you, I might 
have had intelligence every month ; let me urge you, from 
the danger our affairs have been in of totally miscarrying for 
want of intelligence, to pay some attention to this in future. 
</p><p>
As the copy was dated the eighth of July I took occasion to observe, that the honorable Congress had taken the earliest opportunity of informing this Court of the declaration of 
their Independency, and that the variety of important affairs 
before Congress, with the critical situation of the armies in 
their neighborhood, and the obstructions of their commerce, 
had prevented that intelligence which had been wished for, 
but that the present served to shew the early and principal 
attention of the United States to this Court; and as their 
Independency was now in form declared, the queries I had 
formerly put in consequence of my first instructions might 
now be resolved, and I hoped favorably. To this I was 
answered, unless France by a public acknowledgment 
of your Independency makes war on Great Britain in 
your favor, what service can such acknowledgment be of 
to the United States? You are known here, our ports are 
open, and free for your commerce, and your ships are 
protected in them, and greater indulgencies allowed than to 
any other nations. If France should be obliged to make 
war on England, it will be much more just and honorable in 
the eyes of the world to make it on some other account ; 
and if made at all, it is the same thing to the United States 
of America, and in one important view better for them, to 
have it originate from any other cause, as America will be 
under the less immediate obligation. Further, France has 
alliances, and cannot resolve a question which must perhaps 
involve her in a war, without previously consulting them. 
Meantime the United States can receive the same succors 
and assistance from France without, as well as with, such 
an open acknowledgment, and perhaps much more advantageously. To this and such like arguments I had the less 
to reply, as you informed me that articles for a proposed 
alliance with France were under consideration, and that 
1 might soon expect them. 
</p><p>
I was further told that the Swiss Cantons, though in every 
respect free and independent States for several centuries, had not to this hour been acknowledged as such by 
any public act of any one power in Europe, except France, 
and that neither the Revolution in the United Provinces or 
Portugal had been attended with any such acknowledgement, though the powers of Europe in both cases lent 
their aid. I replied that I would not urge a formal 
acknowledgment, as long as the same ends could be 
obtained, and without the inconveniences hinted at ; besides, as I daily expected further instructions I would 
reserve myself until their arrival. The apprehensions of 
the United States' negociating has done us much damage, 
and the interview at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> said to have been between a Commissioner of Congress and the two brothers, 
however politic the step may have been in America, was 
made use of to our prejudice in Europe, at this Court in particular, as it has been for some time asserted by Lord Stormont and others, that a negotiation  would take place, and as 
far as this is believed, so far our cause has suffered and our 
friends been staggered in their resolutions. My opinion is, 
that the House of Bourbon in every branch will be our 
friends ', it is their interest to humble Great Britain. 
</p><p>
Yesterday it was roundly affirmed at Versailles, that a letter was received in London from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, in which it 
was said I had written advising the Congress to negociate, for 
that I could obtain no assistance from Europe. You can 
hardly conceive how dangerous even such reports are, and 
how prejudicial every step that looks like confirming them. 
The importance of America in every point of view, appears more and more striking to all Europe, but particularly to this kingdom. 
</p><p>
Enclosed I send you the size of masts and spars with the 
price, which, if it will answer, may be a certain article of remittance, as may other naval stores, but I dare not contract 
with the marine, as I have no powers, and am unacquainted 
with the rate at which they were usually exported to England. 
A wide field is opening, since the American commerce is to 
be free, and I have had applications from many parts on the 
subject, though few are disposed to venture until the close of 
this campaign, and if it is not decisive against us, our wants 
will be supplied another season at as cheap a rate as ever, 
but I trust never more on the old terms of Ion? credit. 
</p><p>
I am well nigh harrassed to death with applications 
of officers to go out to America. Those I have engaged 
are I trust in general of the best character ; but that I 
should engage, or rather take from the hands of some 
leading men here, some one or two among the rest not 
so accomplished, cannot be surprising, and may, considering my situation, be pardonable, but I have no suspicion of 
any such in my department, of consequence. I have been 
ofFered troops from Germany on the following general terms, 
viz; — officers to recruit as for the service of France, and embark for St Domingo from Dunkirk, and by altering their 
route land in the American States. The same has been proposed with Switzerland, to which I could give no encouragement, but submit it to your consideration in Congress, 
whether, if you can establish a credit as I have before hinted, 
it would not be well to purchase at Leghorn five or six stout 
frigates, which might at once transport some companies of 
Swiss, and a quantity of stores, and the whole be defended 
by the Swiss soldiers on their passage 9 Or, if you prefer Germans, which I really do not, the vessels might go from 
Dunkirk. I daily expect important advices from the North, 
respecting commerce at least, having sent to the King of 
Prussia, in consequence of a memorial he ordered his 
agent here to show me, and propose some queries to me, 
a state of the North American commerce at large. I have 
presented memorial after memorial here, until in my last I 
think I have exhausted the subject as far as the present 
time, having in my last given the history of the controversy, 
obviated the objections made against us, and pointed out the 
consequences that must ensue to France and Spain if they 
permit the Colonies to be subjugated by their old hereditary 
enemy. It consisted of fifty pages, and was, after being 
translated, presented to his Majesty and his Ministers, and 
I was assured was favorably received and considered. I 
presented it about two weeks since, and whether it has hastened the preparations or not I cannot say. The Ministry 
were pleased to say, that I had placed the whole in the most 
striking point of view, and they believed with great justice. 
I could wish to send you copies of these, but I have no assistant except occasionally, and the uncertainty of my situation will not permit my making engagements to one, who 
might deserve confidence, and those who are deserving are but few. 
</p><p>
Bread will be scarce before the next harvest. Flour is 
now 22 and 23 livres per cwt. and tobacco is as I have before mentioned ; and I promise myself you will not let slip 
so favorable an opportunity of making remittances to advantage. In expectation of your sending over frigates to 
convoy your ships, and of your giving instructions on what I have written you of operations in these seas, I design 
being at Bordeaux in March, when I shall be able to give you the needful directions in any such affair ; but, at any 
rate, send out a number of blank commissions for privateers to be fitted out in Europe under your flag. The prizes 
must finally be brought to you for condemnation, and the principal advantage will remain with you. I have written largely, and on many subjects, yet fear I have omitted some things deserving attention. 
</p><p>
Mons. du Coudray will be with you by the receipt of this, with stores complete for thirty thousand men. The 
extraordinary exertions of this gentleman, and his character, entide him to much from the United States, and I hope the 
sum I have stipulated with him for, will not be considered extravagant, when you consider it is much less than is given 
in Europe. Baron de Kalb I consider an important acquisition, as are many other of the officers whose characters I 
may not stay to particularize, but refer you to Baron de Kalb, who speaks English, and to Mr Rogers, who is generally acquainted with them. As to sea officers, they are 
not so easily obtained, yet some good ones may be had, and in particular two ; one of whom I have already mentioned ; 
the other is quite his equal, with some other advantages ; ho was first lieutenant of a man of war round the world, with 
Captain Cook, and has since had a ship, but wants to leave this for other service, where he may make a settlement, and 
establish a family. These two officers would engage a 
number of younger ones. Should they embark, I send herewith the plans of one of them for burning ships. I 
submit it to the honorable Congress, who are sensible of 
the variety and magnitude of the objects before me, whether it is not of importance to despatch some one of its body 
to assist me, or to take a part by his own immediate direction. Such a person known to possess your fullest confidence, would, by his advice and assistance, be of service 
to me, though he were, and I were, occasionally at Madrid or Berlin. Having obtained some knowledge of the language, 
and an acquaintance with those in power here, as well as others, such abilities as I have, which are ever devoted to 
my country, can be employed here to the best advantage at present, but I submit my thoughts to your determination, 
and am, with great truth and sincerity,

Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
The several letters you will receive with this, will give you some idea of the situation I have been in for some months 
past, though after all I must refer you to Mr Rogers for 
particulars on some subjects. I should never have completed what I have, but for the generous, the indefatigable 
and spirited exertions of Monsieur Beaumarchais, to whom the United States are on every account greatly indebted ; 
more so than to any other person on this side the water ; he is greatly in advance for stores, clothing, and the like, and 
therefore I am confident you will make him the earliest and most ample remittances. He wrote you by Mr McCrery, 
and will write you again by this conveyance. A nephew of his, a young gentleman of family, education, and spirit, 
makes a voyage to America with Monsieur du Coudray, and is ambitious of serving his first campaigns in your service. 
I recommend him therefore to your particular patronage and protection, as well on account of the great merits of his uncle, 
as on that of his being a youth of spirit and genius ; and just entering the world in a foreign country, he needs protection 
and paternal advice to countenance and encourage him. This I have confidently assured his uncle lie will receive 
from you, and am happy in knowing you will fulfil my engagements on that score, and, in whatever department you 
may fix him, that you will recommend him to the patronage of some person, on whom you may rely to act at once the friendly and the paternal part. 
</p><p>
A particular account of die stores shipped may probably not be ready by this vessel, but may go by the next or some 
succeeding one, as several will sail after this on the same errand. Let me by every letter urge on you the sending in 
season a quantity of tobacco, of rice, and flour or wheat. These are articles which cannot fail, and are capital ones ; 
twenty thousand hogsheads of tobacco are this instant wanted in France, besides the demand in other kingdoms. I think 
Monsieur Beaumarchais wrote you under the firm of Hortalez & Co. if so, you will address him in the same style ; 
but as I must probably remain here until the arrival of these articles, I can regulate that on the arrival of your despatches. 
I have advised these stores being shipped for some of the New England ports, northeast of Newport first, and if failing 
of making a port there, to stand for the Capes of the Delaware, or for <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> in South Carolina, as the most likely 
route to avoid interception. I cannot in a letter do full justice to Monsieur Beaumarchais for his great address and 
assiduity in our cause ; I can only say he appears to have undertaken it on great and liberal principles, and has in the 
pursuit made it his own. His interest and influence, which are great, have been exerted to the utmost in the cause of 
the United States, and I hope the consequences will equal his wishes. I have the honor to be, he.

Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
I have recommended several officers to your service, but none with greater pleasure, scarce any one with so much 
confidence of his answering great and valuable purposes, as the bearer, Colonel Conway, a native of Ireland, advanced 
in the service by his merit. His views are to establish himself and his growing family in America ; consequently he 
becomes our countryman and engages on the most certain principles. This gentleman has seen much service; his 
principal department has been that of training and disciplining troops, and preparing for action ; and from his abilities as well 
as from his long experience, he is considered as one of the most skilful disciplinarians in France. Such an officer must be, I conceive, of very great service, and his generously confiding in the honorable Congress for such rank and 
appointments as they shall confer, entitles him still more to our immediate attention and notice. I have assured him 
of the most favorable reception, and am confident he will receive the same. 
</p><p>
Colonel Conway takes with him some young officers of his own training, who know well the English language, and may 
be of immediate service in the same important department of discipline. As Colonel Conway has been long in service, 
(though in prime of life) I am confident you will not think it right he should rank under those who have served under him 
in this kingdom, which will not be the case if he fills the place 
of an Adjutant, or Brigadier General, for which, I am well assured, he is every way well qualified. I have advanced him 
as per receipt enclosed towards his expenses and appointments or wages, and told him he may rely on your granting 
him one of the above ranks in the Continental forces. Should the honorable Congress have a new body of troops 
to form in any part of the Continent, this gentleman might take the direction of them to very great advantage, and may, 
I presume, be equally so in the station you may appoint him ill the main army. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &;c.

</p><p>
Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
Among the many important objects, which employ your 
whole attention, I presume ways and means for defraying 
the expenses of the present war have a capital place. You 
will therefore give the following thoughts the weight which 
they deserve. In the first place, to emit more bills will be 
rather dangerous ; for money, or whatever passes for such, 
when it exceeds the amount of the commerce of a state, must 
lose its value ; and the present circumscribed state of the 
American commerce, is perhaps within the amount of your 
emissions already made. Your bills, therefore, must be 
borrowed of individuals by the public at interest, or those 
already emitted paid ofT by taxes and new emissions. 
Some Colonies may now be content with a tax, but it is 
most probably quite out of the power of some, and a 
measure rather impolitic in a majority of the Colonies or 
States, durante bello. 
</p><p>
To effect any considerable loan in Europe is perhaps difficult. It has not been tried, and on the probability of 
succeeding in this I will give my sentiments hereafter. It is obvious, that let the loan be made when it will, it must 
have a day fixed for payment, and respect to some fund appropriated to that purpose. The relying on future taxes 
is holding up to the people a succession of distresses and burthens which are not to cease even with the war itself, 
whereas could they have a prospect of paying the expenses of the war at the close of it, and enjoying the remainder of 
their fortunes clear of incumberance, it must greatly encourage and animate both the public and private spirit in 
pushing it on with vigor. A loan of six or eight millions, or a debt of that amount, will probably enable you to finish 
the war. This I am confident may be negotiated on terms, which I will propose hereafter, but previously let it 
be attended to, that the present contest has engaged the 
attention of all Europe, and more, it will eventually interest all Europe in favor of the United States, the Russians in 
the north and Portugal in the south, excepted ; I make no 
consideration of the light mercenary electorates in my calculation. The mercantile part of the other powers are 
convinced, where their interest appears so evidently engaged. The political part are sensible of the importance 
of enlarging their own naval concerns and force, and of checking that of Great Britain. The good and wise part, 
the lovers of liberty and human happiness, look forward to the establishment of American freedom and independence 
as an event, which will secure to them and their descendants an asylum from the effects and violence of despotic 
power, daily gaining ground in every part of Europe. From those and other considerations, on which I need not 
be minute, emigrations from Europe will be prodigious, 
immediately on the establishment of American Independency. The consequence of this must be the rise of the 
lands already settled, and a demand for new or uncultivated land ; on this demand I conceive a certain fund may now 
be fixed. You may smile, and recollect the sale of the bearskin in the fable, but at the same time you must be 
sensible that your wants are real, and if others can be induced to relieve them, it is indifferent to you whether 
they have a consideration in hand or in prospect. 
</p><p>
I trace the river Ohio from its junction to its head, thence north to Lake Erie on the south and west of that lake to 
Fort Detroit, which is in the latitude of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, thence a west course to the Mississippi, and return to the place of 
my departure. These three lines of near one thousand miles each, include an immense territory in a fine climate, 
well watered, and by accounts exceedingly fertile ; it is not inhabited by any Europeans of consequence, and the 
tribes of Indians are inconsiderable, and will decrease faster than the lands can possibly be demanded for cultivation. 
To this I ask your attention as a resource amply adequate, under proper regulations, for defraying the whole expense 
of the war, and the sums necessary to be given the Indians in purchase of the native right. But to give this land value, 
inhabitants are necessary. I therefore propose, in the first place, that a grant be made of a tract of land at the mouth 
of the Ohio, between that and the Mississippi, equal to two 
hundred miles square, to a company formed indiscriminately of Europeans and Americans, which company should 
form a distinct state, confederated with and under the general regulations of the United States General of America. 
That the Congress of the United States shall, out of such grant, reserve the defraying or discharging of the public 
debts or expenses ; one fifth part of all the lands, mines, &c. within said tract, to be disposed of by the Congress, in 
such manner as good policy and the public exigencies may dictate, the said one filth to be sequestered out of every 
grant or settlement made by the company, of equal goodness with the rest of such grant or settlement. The company 
on their part shall engage to have, in seven years after the passing such grant thousand families settled on said 
grant, and civil government regulated and supported on free 
and liberal principles, taking therein the advice of the honorable Congress of the United States. They shall, also, 
from and after their having one thousand families as above mentioned, contribute their proportion of the public 
expenses of the Continent, or United States, according to the number of their inhabitants, and shall be entitled to a 
voice in Congress, as soon as they are called on thus to contribute. The company shall at all times have the 
preference of purchasing the Continental or common interest thus reserved, when it shall be offered for sale. The 
company shall consist, on giving the patent or grant, of at least one hundred persons. 
</p><p>
These are the outlines of a proposed grant, which you see contains more than 25,000,000 acres of land, the one 
fifth of which, if a settlement is carried on vigorously, will soon be of prodigious value. At this time a company 
might be formed in France, Germany, he. who would form stock of one hundred thousand pounds sterling, to defray 
the expense of this settlement . By such a step, you, in the 
first place, extend the circle of your connexion and influence. You increase the number of your inhabitants, proportionably lessen die common expense, and have in the 
reserve a fund for public exigencies. Further, as this company would be in a great degree commercial, the establishing commerce at the junction of these large rivers, would immediately give a value to all the lands situate on 
or near them within the above extensive description, and future grants might admit of larger reserves, amply sufficient 
for defraying the expenses of the war, and possibly for establishing funds for other important purposes. It may be 
objected that this is not a favorable time for such a measure. I reply it is the most favorable that can happen. You want 
money, and by holding up thus early to view a certain fund on which to raise it, even the most certain in the world, that of land security, you may obtain the loan and engage the monied interest of Europe in your favor. I have spoken 
with many persons of good sense on this subject, which makes me the more sanguine. 
</p><p>
As to a loan, I will now dismiss this scheme to speak of that, only adding, or rather repeating what I have in a 
former letter written, that a large and generous allowance ought immediately to be made for the officers and soldiers 
serving in the present war, in which regard should be had to the wounded, the widows or children of those that fall, and 
to the term or number of campaigns each one serves. This will make the army consist literally of a set of men fighting 
for freehold, and it will be a great encouragement to foreigners, with whom five hundred or a thousand acres of land has a great sound. 
</p><p>
It has been a question with me at times, whether, if our commerce were open and protected, the colonies would be 
wise in negotiating a loan. But on considering, that before this war, the imports of the Colonies just about balanced 
their exports, I cannot think it possible, with the most rigid economy, supposing exports as large as formerly, to 
make a lessening of consumption equal to the amount of the expenses of the war ; and consequently a debt must be 
contracted by the public somewhere. The question which naturally arises is, whether it be most prudent to contract 
this debt at home or abroad. To me it admits of no doubt, that the latter is to be preferred on every account. If you 
can establish a credit and pay your interest punctually, the rate of interest will be less by two or three per cent in 
Europe than in America ; you will thereby engage foreigners by the strongest tie, that of their immediate interest, to 
support your cause. There are other obvious reasons for preferring the latter mode. 
</p><p>
The next question is, where can you borrow, and what security can you offer ? Holland is at present the centre 
of money and credit for Europe, and every nation is more or less indebted to her collectively to such an amount, that 
could the nations in Europe at once pay the whole of their debts to this Republic of Mammon, it would as effectually 
ruin it, as the breaking in of the sea through their dykes. Would you know the credit and situation of the affairs of 
the different kingdoms, consult the books of the Dutch banks. 
</p><p>
This kingdom (France) has been in bad credit, from the villainy of a late Comptroller General, as it is said, one 
Abbe Terrai, against whose administration the severest things have been uttered and written. He was succeeded 
by the much esteemed Mons. Turgot, and stocks rose, and a commission was given to a banker (a correspondent of 
mine in Amsterdam) to negotiate a loan, but the dismission of Mons. Turgot, and the indifferent opinion which monied 
men at least had of his successor, Mons. Clugny, prevented the loan, and lowered the stocks. Mons. Clugny died 
last week, and is succeeded ostensibly by one Monsieur Tabourou ; I say ostensibly, for M. Necker, a noted Protestant banker, is joined with liiin as Intendant of die Treasury. This raised stocks immediately, and I am told 
they have already risen ten per cent. This is the most politic appointment that could have been made, and it 
deserves our notice, that where a man has it in his power to be of public service, his principles of religion are not 
sufficient obstacle to hinder his promotion even in France. This will probably enable this kingdom to borrow money, 
which from all appearances will be soon wanted. Spain, from the punctuality of its payments of interest, and its well 
known treasures, is in high credit in Holland. Denmark borrows at four per cent, Sweden at the same; the emperor 
of Germany, from the security of his hereditary dominions, and the empress of Russia, from her having lately paid 
part of the large sum she borrowed in the Turkish wars, are both of them in good credit. The credit of Great 
Britain, though it has not fallen, yet it is in a critical situation with those foreseeing people, who, on receiving the news of 
the action on Long Island, which raised stocks a triHe in England, began immediately to sell out. 
</p><p>
Not a power in Europe, the king of Prussia excepted, can go to war without borrowing money of Holland to a 
greater or less amount, and whilst so many borrowers are in its neighborhood, whose estates, as I may say. are settled and known, it is not to be expected Holland will be fond of lending money to the United Stales of North 
America, though we should offer higher interest. To oiler a large interest might be templing, but it would be very ruinous 
to us, and I Conceive it will never be thought prudent to permit higher than five per cent interest in the States of 
North America, and this is but one per cent more than is given in Europe. 
This view leads me again to reflect, as I constantly do, with the utmost grief, on the unaccountable delay of proper 
authority announcing the Independency of the United States, and proposing terms of alliance and friendship with 
France and Spain. This I am confident would at once remove this and many other difficulties ; would put our 
affairs on the most established and respectable footing, and 
oblige Great Britain herself to acknowledge our Independency and court our friendship. On such powers being 
received and presented, these kingdoms, I have no doubt, would become our guaranty for the money we want, and 
the produce of our country will be wanted for the interest, and even the principal, as fast as we can transport it hither. 
But as no such powers and instructions are received, and as it is possible you mean not to send any, I will mention a few thoughts on another plan. 
</p><p>
You are not in want of money, but the effects of money in the manufactures of Europe. For these the Colonies 
or United States must now have a demand to the amount of some millions sterling. These manufactures are to be 
had principally in France and Holland. As to the latter, they have not at present, and are resolved never to have, 
any peculiar connexion with, or friendship for, any power, further than their commerce is served by it, but that is not 
the ruling passion of the former. The desire of humbling their old rival and hereditary enemy, and aggrandizing their 
monarchy, are predominant, and never was there a more favorable opportunity than the present, — so favorable is it, 
that were the funds of this kingdom in a little better situation, and were they confident that the United States would 
abide by their Independency, not a moment's time would be lost in declaring war, even though you had made no 
application direct. Whatever part this kingdom takes will be pursued by the Court of Madrid. Would this Court 
give a credit even to private merchants, it would answer the same purpose as a loan ; as for instance, the United 
Colonies w ant about three millions value of manufactures annually (it has heretofore been a little more) from Europe. 
If this Court will give a credit to that amount to any body of men in the kingdom, that company may engage to pay 
the Court the same amount in Continental bills within a limited lime, this company may send to America supplies 
to that amount, as the Congress shall order, such goods as are wanted either for the army or navy ; the Congress will 
instantly deposit their bills for the amount ; the residue may be sold at a stated advance for Continental bills, the whole 
of the amount immediately put on interest to this Court ; this will be the calling in of such an amount of the bills, and 
of course give the greater currency to the whole. Meantime, this Court must become interested to have the commerce free, by which alone remittances can be made. This 
is but a sudden thought, recommended to you for consideration, if deemed worthy. That something may be effected 
in this way I can have no doubt, while I have this most unequivocal evidence. I am now credited to the amount of 
all the supplies for thirty thousand men, a train of artillery, 
amounting to more than two hundred pieces of brass cannon, ammunition, he. &lc. which must be of near half a 
million sterling, not ostensibly by the Court, but by a private company. 'At the same time other companies, as well 
as individuals, after offering any loan or credit I should ask, always brought in sooner or later the condition of 
having my bills endorsed by some banker or person of credit ; where you are sensible in my situation the affair 
ended ; though in several instances I had the most flattering encouragement, and expected most assuredly no security 
would be required ; but that this particular house should be able and willing to advance this prodigious sum at once, 
and without security, is no way surprising, but perfectly consistent with what I have all along asserted. 
</p><p>
The most effectual card now played by the British Ambassador is, asserting that an accommodation will soon 
take place, and by some means or other conjecturing my want of powers by my not appearing at Court, he is bold in 
this assertion, and I find it the greatest difficulty I have to encounter. But I will not enter on a subject, which has 
well nigh distracted me, and embarrassed and disheartened in a greater or less degree every friend of America. The 
late conduct of the Court of Spain respecting Captain Lee, whose case i mentioned before, is a striking proof of what 
I have so positively asserted of the good disposition of both these Courts. They dismissed the complaint against him, 
afforded him protection, with assurances of every assistance he might need, declaring publicly that their ports were 
equally free for Americans as for Britons. I have besides these overt acts still more convincing proofs, that the 
moment your application is made every thing will be set in proper motion. 
</p><p>
I now dismiss a subject which has given, and still continues to give me as much anxiety as I can struggle with, 
and mention another, a little new but indeed somewhat connected with it ; it is the equipping of a number of 
American ships of war in the ports of France. Considering the price of duck, cordage, ordnance, and other military stores in America, they may be built much cheaper 
here. This is not the sole advantage, they may carry over stores of every kind in safety, as being French boftonis, 
ostensibly at least, all the brave and ingenious in the Marine Department in this kingdom would become adventurers 
in person, or in purse and influence in such a scheme; and I speak on good grounds, when T say, that in three months 
after receiving your orders I can have ten ships of at least 
thirty six guns each, at your service, independent of assistance immediately from Government; so much attention is 
paid to the American cause by all persons of consequence 
in this kingdom. The honorable Congress must I conceive either continue emitting bills or borrow money, and I 
submit whether it be not better to borrow of foreign states than individuals, in the present situation of American affairs; 
I am convinced you may borrow five or six millions of Holland, on France becoming your security. This I am 
confident may be obtained on application to this Court and Spain, and that on these principles they can by no means 
be willing to permit the Colonies to return to their former subjection to Great Britain, armed as both countries are. 
Their possessions in America must lie at the mercy of Great Britain, on such an event as a reconciliation with the Colonies. The Colonies being in want of the manufactures of Europe, of this kingdom in particular, this sum would, a principal part of it, rest in France and give a great spring to 
their manufactures, and afford them the advantage of anticipating others in American commerce. These are important objects, and I have no doubt would be considered of consequence sufficient for them to risk such a credit. 
Rich individuals offer to supply any quantity of goods or stores on such security, and I believe the latter would do 
considerable, were they only assured of five per cent interest on their debts after they become due. But I submit 
the whole to the mature consideration of the honorable Congress, and am, etc.

</p><p>
Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
My letters from Bordeaux and since, to which I have received no reply, will give you my situation, but lest some 
of them fail, I will briefly in this give you the history of my proceedings. Immediately on my arrival, I sent forward 
your bills, a large part of which were protested, and intelligence arriving of the loss of Canada, and that Carleton was 
even on the frontiers of the Colonies, and at the same time the formidable armament gone and going over, made every 
one here give up the Colonies as subdued. To have tried for a credit under such circumstances would have been 
worse than useless ; it would have been mortifying, as a refusal must have been the consequence. Mr Delap generously 
offered to advance five or six thousand pounds, but when I considered it was already more than four months since you 
began to prepare for remitting, and that next to nothing was received, I really found myself embarrassed, and hoping 
every day for some relief, I suspended engaging, and came up to Paris, having previously sent Mr Morris's letter to his 
different correspondents, not one of which appeared inclinable to be concerned in a credit. 
</p><p>
I sent to procure the goods in Amsterdam, if to be had, but found our credit worse there than in France. 
A gentleman here offered me a credit for a million of livres, but it was, when explained, on the following conditions. I 
must produce direct authority from the Congress, with their promise of interest ; all American vessels must he sent to 
his address ; and until this could be secured him I must provide a credit, or in other words a security in Europe. Here 
you are sensible my negotiation ended. I then contracted for the supplies of the army, and crowded into the contract 
as large a proportion of woollens as I well could, sensible that with them you might do something, and hoping your 
remittances might still arrive, or some intelligence of the situation of your affairs, for I thought I judged rightly, that if 
in six or seven months you were unable to send out one third the remittances, the returns must be equally difficult. On 
this ground I have been anxiously waiting to hear something from you. Meantime I shipped forty tons of saltpetre, two 
hundred thousand pounds of powder, via Martinique, one hundred barrels via Amsterdam. The late affairs at 
Long Island, of which we had intelligence in October, and the burning of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, the report of Carletoa's having 
crossed the lakes, and that you were negotiating, has absolutely ruined our credit with the greater part of Individuals ; 
and finding so little prospect of completing the Indian goods, I have attended ilie closer to despatch the supplies for the 
army, for which I had obtained a credit ostensibly from a private person, but really from a higher source. Meantime 
the monies remitted are in Mr Delap's hands, except what I have drawn out for my private expenses, for payment of 
the saltpetre, for the fitting out of Captain Morgan, and for the equipment of certain officers going to America. For the 
200,000 weight of powder Mr Delap is my surety, consequently should he receive nothing more from you he will 
have no considerable balance in his hands. Could I have received but one half the amount in any season, I would 
have ventured on the goods long before this, but to what purpose would it have been, could I have been credited the 
amount, if you were unable to remit? The same obstruction must subsist against their arrival. I am however at last 
promised the goods on credit by the san-se way as the stores have been procured, and hope to ship them this month ; but 
some of the articles are not manufactured any where in Europe except Great Britain, and others must be substituted in 
the best manner I can. 
</p><p>
I have written to Mr Delap to send you his account, also to send the particulars to me, which I will transmit as soon 
as received. The goods may be expected in the month of February ; meantime I pray you, not on this account only., 
but on others, to exert yourselves in remitting so much as to 
support the credit of the Continent, for which I am now engaged to a very great amount. Tobacco, rice, Hour, indigo, 
peltry, oil, whale fins, flaxseed, spermaceti, masts, spars, he. are in good demand, Tobacco at 9 to 10 sous per lb. 
and rising, free of duty or expense, save commission. Rice 30 livres per cwt. Flour 22 to 24 livres. 
</p><p>
I am, most respectfully, etc. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=sid" rel="me">SILAS DEANE</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. When I say tobacco is free of duty, I mean if sold to the Farmers-General directly ; on other conditions it is inadmissible at any rate.

</p><p>
Dear Jay, 
</p><p>
If my letters arrive safe they will give you some idea of my situation. Without intelligence, without orders, and 
without remittances, yet boldly plunging into contracts, engagements, and negotiations, hourly hoping that something 
will arrive from America. By General Coudray I send 30,000 fusils, 200 pieces of brass cannon, 30 mortars, 
4000 tents and clothing for 30,000 men, with 200 tons of gun powder, lend, balls, &.c. &«. by which you may 
judge we have some friends here. A war in Europe is inevitable. The eyes of all are on you, and the fear of your 
giving up or accommodating is the greatest obstacle I have 
to contend with. Mons. Beaumarchais has been my Minister in effect, as this Court is extremely cautious, and I now 
advise you to attend carefully to the articles sent you. I could not examine them here. I was promised they should 
be good and at the lowest prices, and that from persons in such station, that had I hesitated it might have ruined my 
affairs. But as in so large a contract there is room for imposition, my advice is that you send back to me samples of 
the articles sent you. Cannon, powder, mortars, etc. are articles knoun ; but send clothes, the fusils, etc. by which 
any imposition may be detected. Large remittances are necessary for your credit, and the enormous price of 
tobacco, of rice, of flour, and many other articles, gives you an opportunity of making your remittances to very great 
advantage. 20,000 hogsheads of tobacco are wanted immediately for this kingdom, and more for other parts of Europe. 
</p><p>
I have written you on several subjects, some of which I will attempt briefly to recapitulate. The destruction of the 
Newfoundland fishery may be effected, by two or three of your frigates sent there early in February, and by that 
means a fatal blow given to Great Britain, I mean by destroying the stages, boats, he. and by bringing away 
the people left there as prisoners. Glasgow in Scotland may be plundered and burnt with ease, as may Liverpool, 
by two or three frigates, which may find a shelter and protection in the ports of France and Spain afterwards. Blank 
commissions are wanted here to cruise under your flag against the British commerce. This is a capital stroke 
and must bring on a war. Hasten them out I pray you. 
France and Spain are friendly, and you will greatly oblige the latter by seizing the Portuguese commerce wherever it 
is found. I have had overtures from the king of Prussia in the commercial way, and have sent a person of great 
confidence to his Court with letters of introduction from his 
Asent here, with whom I am on the best terms. A loan may be obtained for any sums at five per cent interest, perhaps less, if you make punctual remittances for the sums now advanced. The Western Lands ought to be held up 
to view as an encouragement for our soldiers, especially foreigners, and are a good fund to raise money on. You may, if you judge proper, have any number of German and Swiss troops ', they have been offered me, but you know I have 
no powers to treat. A number of frigates may be purchased at Leghorn, the Grand Duke of Tuscany being zealously in fav^or of America, and doing all in his power to 
encourage its commerce. Troubles are rising in Ireland, and with a light assistance much work may be cut out for 
Great Britain, by sending from hence a few priests, a little money, and plenty of arms. Omnia tentanda is my 
motto, therefore I hint the playing of their own game on them, by spiriting up the Caribs in St Vincents, and the Negroes in Jamaica, to revolt. 
</p><p>
On all these subjects I have written to you. Also on various particulars of commerce. Our vessels have more 
liberty in the ports of France, and Spain, and Tuscany, than the vessels of any other nation, and that openly. 
I presented the Declaration of Independence to this Court, after indeed it had become an old story in every part of 
Europe ; it was well received, but as you say you have articles of alliance under consideration, any resolution must be 
deferred until we know what they are. The want of intelligence has more than once well nigh ruined my affairs ; 
pray be more attentive to this important subject, or drop at once all thoughts of a foreign connexion. 
</p><p>
Had I ten ships here I could fill them all with passengers for America. I hope the officers sent will be agreeable ; 
they were recommended by the Ministry here, and are at this instant really in their army, but this must be a secret. 
Do you want heavy iron cannon, sea officers of distinction, or ships ? Your special orders will enable me to procure 
them. For the situation of affairs in England I refer you. to Mr Rogers, Aid de Camp to Mons. du Coudray. I 
have presented a number of memoirs, which have been very favorably received, and the last by his Majesty, but my 
being wholly destitute of other than accidental and gratuitous assistance will not permit my sending you copies. Indeed 
I was obliged to make them so as to explain the rise, the nature, and the progress of the dispute. I have been assured 
by the Ministers, that I have thrown much light on the subject, and have obviated many difficulties, but his Majesty is 
not of the disposition of his great grandfather Louis 14th. If he were, England would soon be ruined. Do not forget 
or omit sending me blank commissions for privateers ; under these, infinite damage may be done to the British commerce, 
and as the prizes must be sent to you for condemnation the eventual profits will remain with you. 
Doctor Bancroft has been of very great service to me 5 no man has better intelligence in England in my opinion, but 
it costs something. The following articles have been shewn to me ; they have been seen by both the courts of France 
and Spain, and I send them to you for speculation. 
</p><p>
1st. The thirteen United Colonies, now known by the 
name of the thirteen United States of North America, shall 
be acknowledged by France and Spain, and treated with as 
Independent States, and as such shall be guarantied in the 
possession of all that part of the continent of North America, which by the last treaty of peace was ceded and confirmed to the crown of Great Britain. 
</p><p>
2dly. The United States shall guaranty and confirm to 
the crowns of France and Spain, all and singular their possessions and claims in every other part of America, whether 
north or south of the equator, and of the Islands possessed 
by them in the American seas. 
</p><p>
3dly. Should France or Spain, either or Loth of them, 
possess themselves of (he Islands in the West Indies now 
in possession of the crown of Great Britain (as an indemnity for the injuries sustained in the last war, in consequence 
of its being commenced on the part of Great Britain in violation of the laws of nations,) the United Colonies shall assist 
the said Powers in obtaining such satisfaction, and guaranty 
and confirm to them the possession of such acquisition. 
</p><p>
4thly. The fisheries on the banks of Newfoundland, 
of Cape Breton, and parts adjacent, commonly known and 
called by the name of the Cod Fishery, shall be equally 
free to the subjects of France, Spain, and the United 
States respectively, and they shall mutually engage to protect and defend each other in such commerce. 
</p><p>
5thly. The more effectually to preserve this alliance, 
and to obtain the great object, it shall be agreed, that every 
and any British ship or vessel found or met with on the 
coasts of North America, of South America, or of the 
Islands adjacent, and belonging thereto, and within a certain degree or distance to be agreed on, shall be forever 
hereafter considered as lawful prize to any of the subjects 
of France, Spain, or the United Colonies, and treated as 
such, as well in peace as in war, nor shall France, Spain, 
or the United Colonies ever hereafter admit British ships 
into any of their ports in America, North and South, or the 
Islands adjacent. This article never to be altered or dispensed with, but only by and with the consent of each of 
the three contracting States. 
</p><p>
6thly. During the present war between the United 
States and Great Britain, France and Spain shall send into 
North America, and support there, a fleet to defend and 
protect the coasts and the commerce of the United States, 
in consequence of which if the possessions of France or 
Spain should be attacked in America by Great Britain or 
her allies, the United States will afford them all the aid 
and assistance in their power. 
</p><p>
7thly. No peace or accommodation shall be made with Great Britain to the infringement or violation of any one of these articles.
</p><p>

Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
You have enclosed the duplicate of an agreement with Mons. du Coudray, of my orders for clothing, stores, &c., of 
my agreement with Baron de Kalb and others of his train, 
</p><p>
States, drawn up by Silas Deane, and presented to the Count Vergennes in his private capacity, Nov. 23, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 
</p><p>
1. Independence to be recognized. 
</p><p>
2. The United States to guaranty and confirm to France and Spain 
all their possessions in North America and the West India Islands. 
</p><p>
3. Should France or Spain gain possession of r.ny of the West 
India Islands, (as an indemnity for the injuries sustained by them in the 
last war, in consequence of its being commenced on the part of Great 
Britain, in violation of the laws of nations,) the United States to assist 
the said powers in gaining satisfaction, and in retaining possession of 
such acquisitions. 
</p><p>
4. The fisheries on the Banks of Newfoundland to be enjoyed equally between the three contracting powers, to the exclusion of all other 
nations. 
</p><p>
5. The regulations of commerce to be reciprocal. 
</p><p>
6. Any British vessel found or met with on the coast of North or South America, or the Islands adjacent or belonging thereto, within 
a certain degree or distance to be agreed on, shall be forever hereafter considered as lawful prize to any of the subjects of France, Spain, 
or the United States, and treated as such as well in peace as in war; — 
nor shall France, Spain, or the United States ever hereafter admit British ships into any of their ports in America, North or South, or the Islands adjacent, nor shall this article ever be altered or dispensed with, 
but only by and with the consent of each of the three contracting States. 
</p><p>
7. During the present war, France and Spain to send fleets into the 
seas of the United States to defend them from the British ; and should 
the possessions of France or Spain in America be attacked, the United 
States to lend such aids as they can for their defence. 
</p><p>
8. No peace to be made with Great Britain, by either of the contracting parties, to the infringement or violation of any one of these articles."  
</p><p>
also with the Comte de Monau and his, which I hope will be agreeable, also the agreement for freight of the ships, which 
I was assured by letters from Bordeaux and elsewhere was as low as could be procured. At the same time, if it is 
above the stated price, in such cases I am promised an abatement. I hope the peculiarity of my situation, and the 
anxious desire I have of forwarding aid to my country, will be considered if any of the articles are thought high. Men 
cannot be engaged to quit their native country and friends, to hazard life and all in a cause, which is not their own 
immediately, at the same easy rate as men will do who are 
fighting literally pro oris et focis, and it is a universal custom in Europe to allow something extra to foreigners, but 
my allowances are very much below the rates here for officers in the same station.

Just as I had closed my despatches by the Generals de Coudray and Baron de Kalb, I was most agreeably 
surprised with a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>, at Nantes, where he arrived, after thirty days passage, with two prizes. I 
hourly expect him here, but knowing of his arrival, I despatch this with a duplicate to Havre de Grace, to go 
by the ships sailing thence, and have only time to inform you, that I sent an express instantly to j\Ir Lee to join us 
here without delay, for the news of <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>'s arrival may occasion his friends being forbid coming from London 
to France. Nothing has, for a long time, occasioned greater speculation than this event, and our friends here are 
elated beyond measure, as this confirms them you will not negotiate with England ; and for me, I will not attempt to 
express the pleasure I feel on this occasion, as it removes at once difficulties under which I have been constantly in

Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
I have met with disappointments, unexpected as they have been affecting ; after orders and counter orders and 
manoeuvres, the very history of which would fill a volume, the Amphitrite departed with the first parcel of the 
stores on the 14th ult., and I was then in full confidence that the other vessels would instantly follow, as they lay 
ready in their different ports, when, to my surprise, counter 
orders arrived. While laboring to remove these, the Amphitrite returned into port, pretendedly through the want of 
live stock, k,c. by the officers. The Captain has protested, that he returned in consequence of the positive orders of 
Mons. du Coudray, to whom a superior power was given. I have no time to decide so disputable a point as that 
respecting Monsieur du Coudray's return, but the consequences have been bad. This, I must say, he acted an 
unwise and injudicious part, in returning into the port lie did, as he thereby gave a fresh alarm to the ministry, and 
occasioned a second counter order. Indeed Mons. du Coudray appeared to have solely in view his own ease, 
safety, and emolument, and instead of instantly despatching the ships with supplies, and thereby preventing a noise, he 
left the ships, and returned quite to Paris without the least ground, that I can (ind, for his conduct ; and has laid hi? 
scheme to pass into America in a ship without the artillery, which is inconsistent and absurd, and contrary to our original agreement, and constant understanding, as I engaged with this man solely on account of the artillery he was to 
assist in procuring, expediting, and attending in person. His desertion of this charge, with his other conduct, makes 
mc wish he may not arrive in America at all. I am sensible that my difficult situation may affect you, and therefore 
I shall, if possible, prevent his going out at all. With respect to the other stores they are embarked, and I am 
promised a permit, which is all I may say on the subject, which is left solely to my management by my colleagues. 
</p><p>
M. du Coudray, not content with leaving the ship, took with him the papers which occasioned a still further delay 
after she was ready ; but I will not enlarge on these disagreeable topics, but wishing the stores at hand, 
I am, with much esteem, etc.

Gentlemen,

The bearer, Mons. Holtzendorff, is a Prussian officer, 
who served the last war in Germany, and with reputation. 
Gentlemen of first character in the army here have recommended him, as an excellent officer both for skill and bravery. I take therefore the liberty of recommending him 
to the service of the United States. He leaves a Major's post there in the army of France, hoping by his services in 
America to advance himself beyond what he can expect in Europe in a time of peace. I shall as soon as possible send 
you a particular account of all my proceedings to the time 
of the arrival of <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>, which I have in a great measure done already, though in detached parts in different

Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
This will be delivered you by Captain Gov, who, with his lieutenant and two sergeants, embarks with thirty field 
pieces, ten ton of powder, ball, lead, he. which I wish safe and in season for service, though delayed beyond my 
expectations. Captain Goy has the best of recommendations from officers of distinction here, and I am confident will be 
found to be of great service in the artillery, a part of which he accompanies. <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> is at present in the country 
in good health, and we shall jointly write you very particularly in a few days ; meantime we are without any intelligence from Congress since he left Philadelphia, in October 
last. I will not attempt to give you an idea of the difficulties, which are the consequence of our being left thus without intelligence, nor the anxiety it occasions in our minds ; 
but must urge you to take some effectual measures for keeping up a correspondence with us in future, without 
which many proposals of the utmost importance to the United States are extremely embarrassed, and in danger of failing. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be,

Sir, 
</p><p>
The bearer. Viscount Mourreu, is the gentleman of whom I formerly wrote, and who has been long detained by 
a variety of accidents, which he can relate to you at large. The engagements taken with him were previous to the 
arrival of my colleagues, who have not therefore intermeddied in the affair. His character and abilities are high in 
estimation here, and the Comte de Broglio has written in particular to <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>General Washington</a>. He served under the 
Comte, who commanded the armies of France with reputation in the last war.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My letter, No. 1 . of this date, gives you the state of Captain Bell's proceedings and the circumstances attending it. 
to this I mean to srive you a short view of the conduct of this Court, with respect to American ships of war, private as 
well as public, which I cannot well do without giving you a history of facts. 
</p><p>
You know that when I left America the naval armaments were but beginning by the Congress, and the inquiry was 
hardly made, even by individuals, whether foreign powers would admit our cruisers and their prizes. After my arrival 
the question was first started by Captain Lee of Marblehead, at Bilboa, of which I gave you an account in my letters of October and November last. Captain Lee carried 
no prize into Bilboa with him, and the question turned simply on the complaint of the English Consul, charging him 
with having committed acts of piracy on the high seas in making prizes of English vessels. The commissary or 
governor of the port detained his vessel and sent to Court 
for directions, and received orders to set the vessel at liberty ; which orders were accompanied with a general declaration, that his Catholic Majesty was neuter in the dispute 
between England and America. Though the issue of this business was favorable, it was not direct to the point ; we 
wished to establish the declaration of neutrality to be general. 
</p><p>
In my letters of October and November last, some of 
which must have been received, I repeatedly gave my sentiments in favor of sending cruisers into these seas. The first that arrived was the Reprisal with two prizes ; this caused much speculation, and at our first audience after, 
we were told, that by the treaties subsisting between France and England, ships of war belonging to any foreign power 
at war with either could not be admitted into their ports, unless driven by stress of weather, or want of provisions, etc. 
and that in such case they could not be permitted to stay longer than twenty four hours, or until the}/ had taken on 
board the provisions necessary to carry them to the nearest port of their respective states, he. as you will see in the 
treaty of commerce of <a href='/results.php?year=1713'>1713</a>, confirmed by all the subsequent treaties. At the same time we were given to understand, that every favor and indulgence compatible with the 
treaties would be shewn us, and that ways might be found out to dispose of those prizes without giving public offence 
to England. The hint was taken, the prizes disposed of, and the Reprisal repaired and fitted for another cruise ; which 
she made on die coast of Spain, taking, among other English prizes, die packet boat from Lisbon ; with which Captain Wickes returned to port L'Orient. On this the English Ambassador complained loudly, and the English merchants 
were alarmed. Insurance rose in London, and it was generally supposed that there would be a restitution of the prizes 
thru detention of Captain Wickes, or a declaration of war. This Court then ordered the prizes as well as Capt. Wickes 
to leave the port in twenty four hours. The former were sent out but sold to French merchants, and Captain Wickes, 
his ship being leaky, was permitted to stay. Soon after this, Captain Johnson arrived in the <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a>, and we, 
having bought a cutter with a view of sending her out as a packet, altered our resolution and equipped her as a cruiser, 
and sent her and the <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a> out under the command of 
Captain Wickes as commodore, with the design of intercepting the Irish linen ships ; but by contrary winds, and mistaking the time of the sailing of those ships, they were unsuccessful as to the main object ; but as they sailed quite 
round Ireland, and took or destroyed seventeen or eighteen 
sail of vessels, they most effectually alarmed England, prevented the great fair at Chester, occasioned insurance to 
rise, and even deterred the English merchants from shipping goods in English bottoms at any rate, so that in a few 
weeks forty sail of French ships were loading in the Thames on freight ; an instance never before known. 
</p><p>
But upon this, the English Ambassador complained in a 
higher tone, and gave us much difficulty ; the prizes however were disposed of, though at a prodigious loss, and 
Captain Wickes set about repairing and refitting the Reprisal, which had been obliged to throw over her guns, and saw 
some of her beams, to escape a seventy four gun ship, which 
chased her and the <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a> on their return from their 
cruise. But before he was refitted, orders were sent from 
Court to detain his vessel and the <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a>, until further orders. This was owing partly to Captain Wickes having 
repeatedly come into the ports of France with prizes, and refitted his ship for fresh cruises, it being directly contrary to the treaty, which they pretend to hold sacred, and partly 
to the transaction at Duulvirk and the consequent threatenings of the British Ministry. In this situation Captain Wickes and Captain Johnson remain at present. Soon after Mr Hodge's arrival, we bought a lugger at Dover, 
and sent her to Dunkirk. Mr Hodge went after her and equipped her with great secrecy, designing a blow in the North Sea. He sent Captain Cunningham in her, and 
ordered him to intercept the packet between England and Holland, and then to cruise northward towards the Baltic, Cunningham fell in with the packet in a day or two after 
leaving Dunkirk, and took her. As she had a prodigious number of letters on board, he imagined it was proper he should return to Dunkirk instead of continuing his course ; in his return he also took a brig of some value, and brought 
both prizes into port. This spread the alarm far and wide, and gave much real ground of complaint, as he had been entirely armed and equipped in Dunkirk, and had returned 
thither with his prizes. The Ministry, therefore, to appease England ordered the prizes to be returned, and Cunningham and his crew to be imprisoned, which gave the English a temporary triumph. 
</p><p>
But not discouraged thereby, another cutter was bought and equipped completely in the port of Dunkirk. Cunningham and his crew were set at liberty, and with some 
address and intrigue he got again to sea from the same port, in a swift sailing cutter, mounting fourteen six pounders and twenty two swivels, with one hundred and six 
men. His first adventure greatly raised insurance on the northern trade, even the packet boats from Dover to Calais were for some time insured. On his leaving the port of 
Dunkirk the second time, he had orders to proceed directly for America, but lie and his crew, full of resentment for the insults they had received from the enemy whilst in prison at 
Dunkirk, and afterwards, attacked the first vessels they met with, and plundered and burnt as they went on. Our last accounts are, that they had taken or destroyed about 
twenty sail, and had appeared off the town of Lynn and 
threatened to burn it unless ransomed ; but the wind proving unfavorable, they could not put their threats into execution. In a word, Cunningham, by his first and second 
bold expeditions, is become the terror of all the eastern coast of England and Scotland, and is more dreaded than Thurot was in the late war. But though this distresses 
our enemies, it embarrasses us. We solicited his enlargement, and Mr Hodge engaged for his going directly for America. I know not how his engagement was expressed, 
but to appease the British Ministry and drive off an instant war, Mr Hodge has been arrested and confined. His 
friends need not be in distress for him ; he will soon be at liberty. He merits much from his country, having been ready at all times to promote and serve its interests. 
</p><p>
Just before the sailing of Cunningham, Captain Burrall arrived in a Maryland pilot boat. He made several prizes 
in his passage, and brought one into Cherbourg with him. He came to Paris for our advice, but on his return suffered 
himself to be enticed on board an English cutter in the port, where he was instantly seized, and the cutter came to 
sail and carried him off prisoner. We complained, and were promised that he should be reclaimed by this Court ; 
it has probably been done, but we have received no answer. The ship General Mifflin, after cruising some time on the 
coasts of England and Ireland, put into Brest, and there, under Continental colors, saluted the admiral, who, after 
consulting his officers, returned the salute, which causes much speculation, and shows that the officers, as well as the 
other orders in this kingdom, are much in our interest. 
But the politics of this Court are intricate, and embarrassed with connexions and alliances on the continent of 
Europe, which, with the state of their fleet, and their sailors being abroad in the fishery, he. puts off bold and decisive 
measures. Some other prizes have arrived in different ports, particularly two valuable Jamaica men sent into 
Nantes a few days since, by Captains Babson and Hendricks. 
</p><p>
This is a brief account of the proceedings of our cruisers, who have put into the ports of this kingdom. The prizes 
are sold without condemnation, and consequently to a great loss, as the whole is conducted secretly, and put too much 
in the power of the agents. Though these cruisers have 
not been profitable to us, they have been of infinite prejudice to our enemies, both in their commerce and reputation. I will not add to this, as I shall write another letter by this conveyance. 
</p><p>
I beg my best compliments to Mrs Morris, and that you will believe me ever, dear sir, yours, etc. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=sid" rel="me">SILAS DEANE</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. Since writing the above the two Jamaica prizes are, by order of Court, arrested, and it remains doubtful 
whether they will not be restored to the original proprietors. The captain of one of the privateers on his passage took on 
board a lady, who was prisoner on board an American privateer, bound for <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. This he did from motives of 
humanity. On his arrival at Painbeuf, she wrote to her brother, a merchant at Nantes, who came down, and 
hoping to get the consignment of the prizes, officiously advised the captain to report them as ships laden at St Eustatia, which they did, and on their arrival at Nantes consigned the prizes to Messrs Lee & Williams, who immediately made a private sale of them. Meantime the owners 
being acquainted with the proceeding, and knowing that the ships and cargoes, by being regularly entered, were in the 
hands of the custom house, lodged claims, showing that they had been falsely entered, and were English property 
captured by American privateers, and consequently by treaty could not be sold in France. This obliged the 
government to arrest die prizes or openly violate the treaty. Mr Williams came up a few days since, and presented a 
memorial on the subject, but I fear he will receive an unfavorable answer. Orders are received for Captains Wickes 
and Johnson to depart the ports of France. I purpose sending duplicates of this letter by each of them. I cannot 
omit any opportunity of doing justice to these gentlemen, their officers and seamen, whose conduct has been such as 
merits the approbation of their countrymen, and has given reputation to our navy in France. They will not be able 
to carry out any goods, though we had purchased some with a design of sending by them, particularly a quantity of 
saltpetre. This, with other articles to a considerable amount, will be sent in the course of this and the next 
month. I have received letters a few days since, advising that Captain Cunningham was at Ferrol. I know not 
where he designs next, having nothing directly from him.

Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
Captain Landais is the bearer of this. He goes in the Heureuse, loaded with stores for America. This cargo 
has, by a succession of obstacles thrown in the way, been delayed from January last, to a most prodigious cost and 
expense. I hope, however, that it may finally arrive in season to be of essential service. Captain Landais, whom 
I have mentioned in my former letters, will offer his service to the United States. I must repeat here what I 
have written before, that I find him to be a skilful seaman, of long experience in every part of the world, of good 
judgment, and of the most unsuspicious honor and probity ; I can but consider him as a valuable acquisition to our navy. 
</p><p>
My agreement with M. Monthieu, the owner of this ship, in case she should not be sold in America, is that she be 
despatched with a cargo of tobacco as soon as possible, if the article is to he had, if not, with such articles as can be 
procured, as I have engaged for the freight out and home, and you are sensible of the necessity of having remittances 
by every opportunity. Whatever this ship may be loaded with, I pray the cargo may come to Messrs Rodrique Hortalez & Co. as they have advanced for the arms and other articles of this cargo, over and above their other large 
advances. Tobacco is the best article at present, in the ports of France, or indeed in any part of Europe, and must 
continue so for a very considerable time yet to come, most probably for twelve months. You will please to send me 
an account of the cargo, whatever it may be, that you ship in this vessel, and duplicates by others. 
I have the honor to be, Sec.

Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
This will be handed you by M. Francy, who is agent for Messrs Rodrique Hortalez & Co. You will see by the 
bills of lading, the quantity of stores shipped by that house, and make some judgment of thehr considei'able amount. 
The vessel, in which IM. Francy sails, is loaded w'lih 
stores, which were long since engaged, but by a succession 
of obstacles have been until this detained. I still hope they 
will arrive in safety, and in season to be of service. The 
ship will be offered you to purchase, if she suits you, and if 
not, it will be equally agreeable to have her returned on 
the owners' account. I could not say any thing of purchasing a slijp, without knowing more of her than I could 
know of this ; I have therefore left it to your option to pay 
the price demanded, or the freight ; the latter is to be what 
is at this time customary in vessels of such force, which not 
being precisely fixed, is sulmiitted to M. Chaumont, by the 
advice and consent of my colleagues ; it will probably be 
about two hundred and fifty livres per ton of goods to 
America, and back to France j it will not exceed that. 
</p><p>
Messrs Rodrique Hortalez h Co. have other vessels, 
which will follow this in a short time, which they want to 
have despatched with tobacco, agreeably to what they formerly wrote you, and M. Francy goes partly on that 
account ; I must therefore pray you to furnish him with the 
means of procuring the quantity he will want for them in 
season. The cargo of the Therese, sent by the way of St 
Domingo, I hope is by this time arrived ; it was so valuable 
that it was thought most prudent to send it by that route, as 
it would run no risk in getting there, whence it might in 
different bottoms be got into the Continent, without the considerable risk of going direct. As the vessels of Messrs 
Hortalez h Co. will arrive at a time when despatch will be 
of the utmost consequence, they are desirous to have their 
cargoes ready on their arrival. By these vessels I will 
write you particularly on this subject, and in the meantime, 
have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, &tc.

Dear Sir,
 
As many of the commissioners' letters may have failed, I take the liberty of enclosing an extract of a letter written 
jointly by <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> and myself in March last, in which we sent an extract of a letter from Mr Lee, who had been 
at Nantes, and was then at Bordeaux. This letter was to the committee, and consequently to Congress. We wrote 
one also previous to this, to the committee, just before Mr Lee's going to Nantes. 
I am informed that it is insinuated, that interested and private views influenced me to write as I did, and that the 
fixing Mr Williams at Nantes was the object I had in view. I am very sorry you should be so imposed upon ; the consequences must ultimately be more prejudicial to yourself than to any other person. In the meantime, as a man of 
honor, I assure you I have neither interest or connexion in Mr Williams' business, nor have I engaged in the smallest 
private concern, except what you have been acquainted with, and which you know was in consequence of your letters in June, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 
</p><p>
Mr Williams came to France to visit <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> ; he was in a good wav of business in London, where he was 
entering into business with a capital house in the sugar business. England was disagreeable to him, solely on 
account of the animosities, which prevailed among individuals on account of the public quarrel. The stores which I 
had engaged, and which were sent out in the Mercury and 
Therese, were at Nantes, where matters had been so conducted that you must suppose I had no confidence in the 
managers. On this occasion I applied to ^Mr Williams, as a friend, to make a journey to Nantes, to examine the goods 
and sec them shipped. He left Paris without intending to tarry longer than to perform this business. But his conduct 
at Nantes was so much the reverse of what had preceded, that every one who wished well to our affairs desired that he 
might be continued there. I needed no solicitations ; the interest of my country was my sole motive ; I knew he 
</p><p>
Allusion is here made to certain charges or complaints against Mr Thomas Morris, brother of Mr Robert Morris. He had been a merchant 
in Nantes, and was an agent for transacting in that port the mercantile affairs of ilic United Slates. 
served it faithfully, and I knew him to be generous and disinterested in the service. Yes sir, disinterested ; and 
you will acknowledge it when you are informed, that what he exacted of us was barely a sufficiency to support him, 
not amounting to one fourth of one per cent on the business. He has, if I am to have the credit of fixing him 
there, done me great honor ; he has, at the same time, obtained the good opinion and friendship of the capital 
persons at Nantes. I am thus particular on this subject, as I am well convinced it has been represented to you very 
differently. How it has been represented I know not, nor am I likely to be informed but from second hand, from your 
brother's showing your letter directed to me to Mr Ross, and telling some others what were its contents, and that 
you not only justified his conduct, but had obtained for him more ample appointments, with severe reprimands to me, 
and even oblique censure on <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>, who happens to be Mr Williams' uncle. 
</p><p>
It is hard for me, acting as I have done, from the most 
disinterested motives, and from those principles of friendship which shall be ever sacred with me, to be thus censured by you unheard. 
</p><p>
Mr Ross does justice to the character you gave of him. I expect to see him in Paris in a few days, when I shall show him what I now write you. 
</p><p>
I have not the least desire of intermeddling in the commercial concerns of the Congress in Europe, nor of going 
out of my own department, whatever it may be, on any occasion but I have been obliged to take much upon my 
hands in procuring supplies of clothing, &lc. as have also my colleagues, on account of the unhappy situation of our 
affairs here as to commerce. I will not add to a letter already long, only that it I have been mistaken in any thing, 
you will reflect that I write in reply to a part of one of yours, which I am unable to procure a sight of, and assure 
you that no private concern affects me more, than having drawn on myself your resentment by my desire of serving 
you. Be assured that I retain the highest esteem and respect for you in your public as well as private character. 
and am your sincere friend, etc.

I have now the pleasure of acquainting your Excellency of my arrival here yesterday, on board the Languedoc, commanded by his Excellency <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='met colleague'>Count D'Estaing</a>, with a 
fleet of twelve sail of the line, and four frigates. We sailed from Toulon the lOth of April last. I presume therefore that I have no intelligence from Europe so late as what you must be possessed of already. Finding that the 
enemy had escaped, the Admiral resolved instantly to pursue them to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and will sail this morning for that 
port, but he has no pilot. If, therefore, pilots can be sent to meet him on his arrival, it will be of the utmost service

and hope soon to have the honor of paying my respects to your Excellency and die honorable Congress in person, 
and to congratulate you on the late glorious events. I have sent Commodore Nicholson express, who can inform you 
of our situation. Permit me to recommend him as an active, spirited officer, to whom the Admiral has been much 
obliged by his services during our passage. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the most profound respect, 
your Excellency's most obedient, and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=sid" rel="me">SILAS DEANE</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. His Excellency the Admiral desires, that, on the arrival of the pilots at the Hook, where they will find 
his fleet, they would make a signal with a white flag, either on board their boat, if they have one, or from the 
shore, formed in a triangle. Mons. Chouen, who will wait on you with a letter from the Admiral, sets out suddenly, 
and may want money to bear his expenses on his further journey. Mons. Gerard desires he may be supplied on his 
account, with any sum to the amount of twenty thousand livres.

the orders of Congress, announcing my recall, and directing my immediate return.

This was the first and only intimation I ever received of the resolutions of Congress on the subject ; I immediately

Unfortunately my passage has been much longer than I expected, and I but now begin to find myself recovering

Sir, 
</p><p>
I received your note, in which you politely informed me that you had laid before Congress the letter, which I did 
myself the honor of writing to your Excellency a few days since. I now return you my thanks for the attention you have 
paid me, and again take the liberty to ask of you to remind Congress, that the circumstances under which I left France, 
and the situation of the affairs in Europe, which I had been principally concerned in transacting, (as I had the honor of 
mentioning to Congress) render it indispensably necessary on my part, that I return as early as possible, and that if 
my further attendance here is not necessary, I pray to be informed of it, that I may be at liberty to visit my friends, 
and prepare for my voyage ; or that if further intelligence is expected from me, I may have an early opportunity of giving it. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself your Excellency and the Congress will not judge my repeated applications improper, when the 
circumstances which attended my leaving Europe, and the situation I have been in since my arrival in America, are recollected and considered. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, Sic.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
In consequence of an order of Congress on the 8th of December, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>, for me to embrace the first opportunity 
of returning to America, and " upon my arrival to repair with all possible despatch to Congress, that they might be 
well informed of the state of affairs in Europe in that critical juncture," I left Paris the 1st of April last, having 
received the order on the 4th of March preceding, and arrived in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, the seat of Congress, on the 13th 
of July following, ready at the pleasure of Congress to render such information as was in my power to give. In this 
situation I continued until the 15th of August, when I received the order of Congress to attend them on the 17th, 
on which day, and on the 21 st, I had the honor personally to inform Congress generally, of my public transactions 
under their authority from the time of my departure from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> in March, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>, until my return. 
</p><p>
In these audiences, I particularly stated and explained the unsettled state, in which the commercial transactions of 
the commissioners in Europe were at my departure, and that as well from their nature and extent, as that even at 
my departure from Paris many large orders were not completed, and of consequence, neither the accounts or vouchers 
delivered ; that the interval between my receiving my order of recall, and my departure in compliance with it was so 
short, as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further, than to be able to give a general state of 
them, which I then mentioned generally, and added, that I was under the necessity of returning speedily to Europe, as 
well on account of those, as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled slate. At my last 
audience, I found and expected, that I should be called upon to answer questions, which might be put to me for the 
obtaining more clear and explicit information, than what I had given of some particulars in my general narration, and 
I held myself in readiness to attend the pleasure of Congress for that purpose. In this situation my private affairs 
pressed my immediate departure from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and my public as well as private affairs in Europe no less urged 
my departure from America. On the 8th of September, I took the liberty of reminding that honorable body, that I 
was still waiting to receive their orders, if they desired my further attendance upon diem, and my affairs daily pressing, 
on the 11th of September, I again reminded Congress of 
my waiting their pleasure, and took the liberty of mentioning the reasons that pressed mc to be anxious for their 
immediate decision. As Congress have not thought proper to make any reply to my letters, nor to admit me to lay 
before them such further information as they may desire, and I am enabled to give, and as from the many weighty 
affairs upon their hands it is uncertain when I may be admitted, and as my concerns will not permit my longer continuance in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I take the liberty of enclosing to 
your Excellency the account of the banker, in whose hands all the public monies were deposited, of which I gave you 
some time since a general state for your private information, and which I obtained from the banker but a day or 
two before my departure from Paris, with the view of giving 
all the information in my power on every subject to Congress, in which they were interested, and which account I 
expected in the course of my narration to have delivered personally to Congress. 
</p><p>
As to any other subject on which further information may be desired, I shall be ready to give it, whenever that 
honorable body shall call on me for it, during the short time my affairs will permit me to tarry in this city. I have 
indeed thought that some further information would be necessary; I have daily expected to be called upon for it. 
On this consideration alone, I have, notwithstanding the pressing circumstances I have found myself in, waited with 
patience the orders of Congress. I shall be happy if such information or any other service in my power may be found 
agreeable and of use to that respectable body and the United States, to whom I have long since, and ever shall 
be devoted. I have only further to request that honorable body to be assured, that I shall ever retain a most grateful 
sense of the confidence, which they have heretofore honored me with, and consider it as the most honorable and happy 
circumstance of my life, that I have had the opportunity of rendering important services to my country, and that I am 
conscious of having done them to the utmost of my ability. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to remain, with the utmost respect, etc.

Sir, 
</p><p>
Being informed that letters from Mr Izard, reflecting on my character and conduct whilst in the service of the public 
abroad, have been read in Congress, I have to ask that honorable body to grant me copies thereof, and that I may 
be permitted to wait on Congress, and to be heard in my vindication. I have that regard for Mr Izard's opinion of 
my ability and disposition to transact public business, which I ought to have, and am consequently easy on that subject ; 
but facts asserted, which affect either, call for an explanation. Those indeed, which respect myself personally, 
require none before Congress, nor will I trouble that honorable body with the making any ; but those which regard 
my character and conduct as a public minister, and in so important a transaction as that of the late treaties of Paris, 
call on me, as well injustice to the public as to myself, for an explanation, which I am very happy in the having it in 
my power to give, as well as in the confidence I have, that Congress will neither delay nor refuse doing this justice to 
a faithful and greatly injured servant of theirs.

Sir, 
</p><p>
In consequence of my letter of the 24th ult. I had the honor of receiving the order of Congress of the 26th, directing me to attend on the 29th, at three o'clock in the afternoon, that day being assigned for my being heard ; I was 
at the same time favored with extracts from Mr Izard's letters. On the 29th, I was served with an order of 
Congress, which postponed my being heard to some future time. On the od instant an extract of a letter from the 
honorable Arthur Lee, dated Paris, June 1st, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, was given me by order of Congress. I have for some time past 
waited with the greatest impatience for an opportunity of being heard before that honorable body, confident that my 
peculiar situation will excuse my impatience. I must, without repeating what I have already had the honor of writing 
to you, once more urge for as early an audience as the important business before Congress will admit of.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I received your letter of the 7th instant, in which you informed me, that mine of the same date to you was by 
Congress ordered to lie on the table, until the examination of Mr Carmichael should be finished. 
</p><p>
Though totally unable even to conjecture, what relation the 
examination of that gentleman can possibly have to those abusive and injurious letters, written by Mr Izard and Mr Lee, yet, 
as I had so often troubled Congress during a three months' attendance, with my repeated solicitations to be heard, I 
forbore repealing them until neither my health, my interest, 
nor my honor will permit me a much longer stay in America; I have, therefore, taken the liberty of enclosing my 
answers to the letters of those gentlemen. It pains me to be obliged to answer at all, and it grieves me exceedingly to be 
deprived of the opportunity of doing it in person ; I still hope to be indulged before leaving America. I have only further 
to inform Congress, that I shall go into the country tomorrow, for a few days, that having engaged a passage in a ship, 
which will sail for France sometime next month, I propose to leave <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> in a few days after I return from 
the country, in order to embark, and shall esteem myself honored by Congress if they have any thing further in 
which I may be of service to my country, if they will favor me with their commands.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
In the extracts from the letters of the honorable Mr Izard, I find charges which respect me, supported by his 
opinions, and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable Arthur Lee, who, by his own account, is my 
irreconcilable enemy. I find also charges against the honorable <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> and myself jointly, supported on the 
same grounds, with this difference, that almost every complaint against us lies equally against Mr Lee, and it is worthy of remark, that where the charge lies equally against us 
all, Mr Izard leaves Mr Lee wholly out, and fixing it solely on <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> and myself, proceeds to represent the Doctor as entirely under my influence. My situation has, through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate, and in nothing more so than in this, that Mr Izard's letters, written as much with the design of impeaching <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>'s conduct as mine, now operates solely against me. 
</p><p>
Mr Izard says, in his letter of the first of April, That if the whole world had been searched, it would have been 
impossible to have found a person more unfit than I was for the trust, with which Congress had honored me." It does 
not become me, and possibly not even Mr Izard himself, to determine on my competency to that trust, and I have only 
to observe, that both of us were appointed by the authority of Congress, with this only difference, that I had the honor 
of being personally known to the members who composed that body, and I can add with pleasure, that I always paid 
respect to Mr Izard from the choice they had made of him, which I doubt not was on good information. I shall feel 
no uneasiness on my own account, that Mr Izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of Congress, whilst on the 
same records there will be found that of his Most Christian Majesty, of his Minister, and Secretary of State, and of my 
venerable colleague, revered through Europe as the first of patriots, as well as philosophers, whom this age has produced. I find but two charges which respect me personally ; the first is, the exercising such a degree of hauteur 
and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom I transacted business. I transacted none with Mr Izard, and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business I transacted, and the worthy and honorable persons with whom I transacted it, and who, from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom, honored me with their friendship and their confidence. I desire it 
may be remembered, that, when I went abroad, charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for 
Congress, in the year <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>, I arrived at Paris as late in the season as the month of July, without funds, uncertain of 
remittances, without credit, ignorant of the language and manners of France, and an utter stranger to the persons in 
power and influence at Court ; that I had not the patronage of any person of importance, and had no correspondence 
or connexions established in any part of Europe. The news of our misfortunes in Canada arrived in France with 
me, and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately 
after, and was, as usual, exaggerated by the British Ambassador and his emissaries. In a word, without remittances, 
or even intelligence from Congress, and under all these disagreeable circumstances, I had to oppose the artifice, the 
influence and the power of Great Britain ; yet I have the 
pleasing reflection that before the first of December following, I procured thirty thousand stand of arms, thirty thousand suits of clothes, more than two hundred and fifty pieces 
of brass artillery, tents, and other stores to a huge amount provided the shins to transport them, and shipped a great 
part of diem for America. Many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's 
operations, and enabled my brave countrymen, in some parts of America, to make a good stand against the enemy, 
and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> and his whole army 
an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences, as it accelerated the completion of that alliance, to which the 
honorable Congress, with every true friend to the United States, have given their approbation. During this short 
period I had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country, not only in France but in 
Holland, at the Court of Russia, and elsewhere in Europe ; and though the grant of money by the Court of Versailles 
was not at this time actually made, I had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it. These 
facts, without mentioning others of no less importance, will shew what business I transacted ; and the character given 
me by those great personages, with whom I was in my public character connected, will evince the degree of reputation in which I stood. It is my misfortune that Mr Izard was of a different opinion. 
</p><p>
The second charge is, that Mr Arthur Lee had assured him, that his despatches to Congress, and even one of his 
private letters had been opened by me. I am surprised Mr Arthur Lee never intimated this to me, and that he should 
communicate it to Mr Izard, to be reported in this manner. I think it however sufficient for me to say here, what I shall 
say elsewhere, and on all occasions, that this is a groundless calumny, which I should not have expected, even from 
an enemy, at least not from a candid or generous one. 
</p><p>
Mr Izard complains that <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> and myself concealed from him, or attempted to conceal the opportunities 
of writing to America, as well as the intelligence received from thence. In reply to this, it need only be observed, 
that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to America and to Congress, without the knowledge and consent of Mr Arthur Lee, and no intelligence received to which he was not privy. That he was often with Mr Izard, and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary inlbnuaiion ; if Mr Lee did not: 
acquaint Mr Izard, he is at least equally culpable with us, and it" he did, there is no ground for the complaint. It is 
true, that neither Mr Franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents, 
until the consent of the Court should be had ; we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of 
Mons. Gerard, and the sailing of the Toulon fleet. Mr Izard appears, however, to have been well informed of the 
former at least, and that very early, and of the latter on the day of our leaving Paris. Mr Arthur Lee knew of it 
sometime before, as he wrote many letters by his Excellency Mons. Gerard. In justice, therefore, the complaint 
ought not to have been made solely against <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> and Mr Deane, and particularly against the latter. 
</p><p>
Mr Izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at Paris. It is 
true. He is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it, but in this he is mistaken, as the treaty itself 
and all our other public transactions will demonstrate. Mr Izard is of opinion that France might have been brought to 
have taken an active part much earlier. If circumstances, not in our power, had taken place earlier, they possibly 
might ; but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages, as is evident from the representation I 
made to Congress when I had the honor of being heard on the 19th of August last. As the 11th and 12th articles of 
the treaty are complained of, and as this subject immediately interests the public, I have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his Excellency Mons. Gerard, who agrees to the 
truth of every part thereof, which has come to his knowledge. This I beg leave to present to Congress, as it will 
show that Mr Izard had not the best information, and that 
neither <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> or myself (though " born in New England") procured the insertion of those articles ; it will further 
show that the Court of France never urged it, but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or 
both omitted. It will also appear, that Mr Lee himself wrote and signed the letter, desiring they might be inserted, 
and that he afterwards had a private conference with M. Gerard on the subject, and appeared perfectly satisfied. 
If any doubts arise on this subject, I shall be happy to refer for satisfaction on that head to Mons. Gerard, and also for 
what passed between Mr Lee and himself on the occasion,: as well as for the pretended verbal promise that the article 
should be expunged if objected to by Congress. I have signed that narration, and shall sign these observations in 
which I have avoided taking those advantages of Mr Izard, which the passionate and partial complexion of his letters 
has given me, were I disposed to make use of them ; because, I conceive it to be an abuse, if not an insult to 
trouble Congress with any thing merely personal, though I have provocation sufficient to justify me in the eyes of the 
world, and am by no means deficient in materials. 
</p><p>
I recollect perfectly well the interview at Passy with Mr William Lee, at which Mr Izard v;as present, but I do not remember that any such letter as he describes was either 
desired or refused. I rather think that Mr Izard misunderstood <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> at the time, or that his memory has deceived him, the facts are these. The late Mr Thomas 
Morris had a commission to act as commercial agent ; his 
commission was entirely distinct from, and independent of,the commissioners ; he at least construed it so himself from 
the beginning. We were very early informed of his irregularities, and admonished him, and advertised Congress of 
them. As we could get no account of the disposition of the prizes brought into France, and the expense of repairing 
and equipping the vessels of war fell on the commissioners, <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> and myself (Mr A. Lee being then at Berlin) 
deputed Mr Williams to take the care of the prizes into his own hands, and ordered the Captains to account with him. 
On Mr William Lee's arrival at Nantes he joined with Mr Morris in writing a severe letter to the commissioners on 
what they had done, in which they complained, that the office or department of commercial Agent was broken in 
upon, and that we had no power over it. <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>, at the desire of Mr A. Lee and myself prepared an answer, 
in which the reason of our orders was given, and Mr Morris' conduct urged as our principal motive, but that as he, Mr William Lee, was there, we would recall our commission 
from Mr Williams. Mr Arthur Lee would not agree to the form of the letter, and alter much dispute upon it, a second 
was written, when Mr Arthur Lee observed, that his brother was coming to Paris soon to receive his commission for Vienna and Berlin, and as there were then no prizes in port, 
or expected, the matter might rest. This was the reason why Mr W. Lee's letters were not answered. He came to Paris soon after, and represented the confused state in which 
affairs were at Nantes, and urged the interposition of the commissioners to put the whole agency into his hands. 
The situation of Mr William Lee at that time was precisely this ; he had never received any commission either from 
Congress or their committee for the commercial agency, whilst Mr Thomas Morris was, and had been in the posses-^ 
sion of a commission, and in the exercise of the agency. Congress had made Mr William Lee their commissioner 
to the courts of Vienna and Berlin, each of which places is at least a thousand miles from the scenes of our commerce, 
without saying anything about his former appointment, from which it was natural to suppose his former appointment had 
been considered as superceded by the new. We had received intelligence, that the information we had given of Mr Morris's conduct, had been received and read in Congress, 
and that Congress notwithstanding chose to continue him in this situation. We thought it very extraordinary that we 
should be applied to, to interfere where Congress, knowing the facts, had declined to interfere, and still more so, that 
we should be requested to put (what indeed was not in our power) the commercial agency into the hands of a gentleman, who must execute it by deputies ; himself at a distance 
too great either to see or correct the abuses that might be practised. The letter referred to by Mr Izard was a letter 
to this purpose, and I remember well (for I avoided bearing any considerable part in the conversation) <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague'>Doctor Franklin</a>'s reply, which was to this purpose, that Congress by disregarding the information we had given, and continuing Mr Morris, had impliedly censured our conduct. That Mr Morris had treated us ill personally for what we had done, 
and that Mr William Lee ought to remember, that he had himself jointly with Mr Morris complained of our interfering 
as he thought in that department ; and therefore he did not incline to subject himself to any further censures, or as he 
expressed it "raps over the knuckles" for meddling in the affair. We were indeed as much surprised as Mr Izard appears to have been on the occasion, but our surprise arose 
from another cause ; it was to find Mr William Lee desirous of holding such a plurality of appointments in their own 
nature incompatible with each other, and impossible to have been executed by the same person. But as one of the places was supposed to be a lucrative one, the subject was too delicate to be touched on by us. 
</p><p>
Mr Izard says that Mr William Lee complained that parties had been excited against him at Nantes, and that so far from having been supported by the commissioners in the 
execution of his duty, these gentlemen had as much as possible contributed to perplex him in the discharge of it ; that he had frequently written, &:c. His letters have been taken 
notice of already, and the reason mentioned why they were not answered. The rest of this complaint is, as far as I know anything about the matter, totally groundless ; it must 
appear so to every one acquainted with the following particulars. Mr William Lee never had a commission to the commercial agency, though he is now executing it by his agents. 
Mr Lee's caution was such, that he never even answered my letters to him in February or March, informing him that Mr Robert Morris had written to me, that he was appointed ; nor did I learn anything from him of his intentions, until he arrived at Paris the summer following, where also he acted with the greatest caution,while he waited the return 
of his brother from Berlin. Before and after his being at Nantes, he went so far as even to desire Mr Williams and others at Paris and at Nantes not to let it be known, that he 
had anything to do in American affairs, as he said it would greatly prejudice his interest in London ; and so far was he from ever executing, or publicly attempting to execute, that 
agency, until after the news of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>'s defeat had arrived in France, that he did nothing that ever I heard of, which could have prevented his returning to the exercise of his Aldermanship in London. 
</p><p>
Mr Izard is pleased to say, that "to let Mens. Gerard go away without giving him the least intimation of it, was a very high insult to Congress." It was not in our power to 
permit or prevent Mons. Gerard's going away, and if we did not, circumstanced as we then were, think ourselves, authorised to communicate it to Mr Izard, I cannot conceive 
this to be a high insult to Congress ; certain it is, we meant no such thing ; we meant to serve, not insult that honorable body. " The object," he says, " of these gentlemen is to 
have Mr Deane come back in a public character, if not to France, perhaps to Holland, or some other part of Europe, and therefore they are afraid of having reasons given why 
this should not be die case." And he adds, " I am of opinion that he is upon every account an improper person to be employed by Congress." I have already appealed from 
this gentleman's opinions, so I shall say nothing further about them; bis reasons, if he offers any, are to be judged of by Congress. I find, however, he had more apprehensions than 
reasons in this part of his letter ; his apprehensions as well as opinions were in part at least groundless ; he was apprehensive lest my venerable colleague would solicit some 
appointment for me ; I do not learn that he has done it, I never desired or expected that he would. Mr Izard, I 
presume, knew that I had a very extensive correspondence with gentlemen of the mercantile and monied interest and 
character in Europe, but particularly in Holland, where I had long before been preparing the minds of such men in 
favor of a loan. He knew that there was not merely a correspondence, but a strict personal friendship subsisting 
between certain gentlemen in Amsterdam and at the Hague and myself, and that I had proposed to go there on the 
subject of the loan, as well as for other purposes. I presume also lie knew, that the French Ambassador in Holland, 
the Duke de Wauguyson, who spent last winter in Paris, honored me with his acquaintance, and with all the politeness as well as zeal for the interest of the United States of 
North America, which make part of that nobleman's character, urged me to go there, assuring me of every personal service and civility, which should be in his power. My 
recall prevented the execution of the plan, and Mr Izard doubtless apprehended that I should solicit for the appointment. His apprehension was groundless ; the honorable 
Congress know that I have not solicited for any appointment ; my life and fortune, with what abilities I am blessed 
with, have been from the first, and will ever be devoted to the service of my country, who are most certainly the best 
judges in what department they can be most useful ; or if they can be of any use at all, and to their judgment I most cheerfully submit. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I beg leave to lay before Congress a few observations on the extracts from Mr Arthur Lee's letter, dated Paris, Juno 
1st, 177S, read in Congress the 3d instant, which were ordered to be communicated to me. Mr Lee begins by 
saying that, M. Monthieu's papers were sent to show you the demands that are made upon us, and the grounds of 
them J you will see that they are accounts, which Mr Deane ought to have settled.
</p><p>
Not having seen the accounts or papers said to have been sent, I can only reply generally by informing Congress, that I contracted with M. Monthieu (nearly at the lime that I contracted with Mons. Beaumarchais for the stores) to procure ships to transport them over to America; the rate, I was told in Paris and elsewhere, was as low as could be 
then procured in France ; it has risen since that time. The ships were to have been despatched in a reasonable 
time to and from America. 31ons. Beaumarchais was my surety. The difficulty met with in getting away the stores 
was such, that the last of the ships did not sail from Marseilles until in September, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. The delay of near twelve 
months of some of them in France, and an uncommon delay of all of them, occasioned by repeated counter orders, and 
fresh obstacles rising in the way of embarking those stores, 
as well as the unexpected detention of those ships in America, as for instance, of the Amphitrite, from April until the 
October following, with the capture of them, were circumstances unforeseen and unexpected at the time of making 
the contract, and entitled M. Monthieu to an equitable consideration over and above the freight stipulated. Before 
the last ship sailed, therefore, M. Monthieu insisted that some mode for a settlement should be agreed upon ; on 
which <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> and myself agreed with him to submit the whole to Mons. Chaumont ; the submission was made 
and signed. M. Monthieu, on his return from Marseilles, (to which place he went immediately to embark and send 
off the remainder of the stores) urged Chaurrr)nt to undertake it. I did the same ; he declined, telling me 
that he found Mr Lee of so jealous and unquiet a disposition, and so much disposed to abuse every one that he had 
any concerns with, that he had well nigh resolved never to have any thing more to do with the commissioners, while 
he was one of them ; but as M. Monthieu had other concerns with the commissioners, he thought it best to settle 
the whole at once, and when the whole was ready for a settlement, if Mr Lee would then desire him to undertake it, 
he would do it as well to oblige us as M. Monihieu, for whom he had a regard. This put off the settlement for the time. 
</p><p>
Mr Lee proceeds to say, " It is this sort of neglect, and studied confusion, that has prevented Mr Adams and myself, 
after a tedious examination of the papers left with <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>, from getting any satisfaction as to the expenditures of the public money. All we can find is, that millions have been expended, and almost every thing remains to be paid for." 
</p><p>
I am not surprised at any thing of this kind from Mr Lee, nor that Mr John Adams has not joined with him in this 
letter, though I dare say, that gentleman knows his duty, and has done it, as well to the public as to me. After 
premising that Mr Lee had in his hands the accounts of all the monies received and paid out on the public account, I 
will lay before Congress the facts, which he had before him when he wrote this letter, after which Congress will be able 
to judge whether Mr Lee had any grounds for his representing me as a public defaulter for millions. It is certain, 
that Mr Lee knew that the total amount of monies received by the commissioners to the lime of my leaving Paris, 
</p><p>
iiinoiinled to (livres) L?,753,250 
</p><p>
And that tlu! halaiK'C iliio Mr Grand, the 27th March, was 203,738 17 
</p><p>
And that the whole expenditures to that day, consequently was (livres) 4,040,988 17 
</p><p>
111 tlii^ uv\l place, it will appear, that my nnich the c^reatcr ])art of this was actually expcndeil and paid out by and 
with Mr Lee's consent and orders at the time ; the whole was well known to him, as he had, from lime to time, access 
to Mr Grand's books, and Mr Grand delivered him copies thereof up lo the 27th of March last, by which he had before 
him an account of every paynirnt that had been made, and I sent him in writing; an explanation of every payment that had been made in his absence, or which had not been made by his wntlcii ordiM'. 
</p><p>
The accounts of the particular articles in detail, not being here, I am unable to explain every charge in Mr Grand's 
account, it is sufficient that Mr Grand's account shows, that the nature of nearly the whole of the expenditures was 
perfectly well known to Mr Lee, when he wrote the above account of millions expended, and represented he knew not 
how to show this. I have stated Mr Grand's account in a shorter compass than what it was before, and have brought 
the different payments (or particular objects made to different people into one view, as will be seen in the annexed 
stale or explanation of Mr Grand's account. 
</p><p>
I have no design in answering this part of Mr Lee's 
letter to go farther into the accounts than to show demonstratively, that nothing can be more groundless and unjust, 
than for him to represent that millions had been profusely 
expended, and as if ho knew not in what manner or to what purpose. The amount of expenditures, until the time of my 
leaving Paris, was 4,040,938 17 livers, and it appears, as 
well from the nature of the account, as from the knowledge 
Mr Lee had of the transactions, that he knew generally 
of the payment of every livre, and to whom it had been 
made, having the accounts and the explanation of them in 
his hands, up to the very day I set out from Paris. The 
particular application, indeed, of every part, could not be 
known until the several accounts should be given in. ISIr 
Lee himself signed the orders for much the greater part of 
the monies to Mr Williams, and the other principal payments, and was well informed of the business which he (Mr 
Williams) was executing. By this staling of the account 
it will appear, that the commissioners, for their private 
expenses, from December, <a href='/results.php?year=1770'>1770</a>, to 27th March, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, 
for the support and relief of Americans, escaping from 
prison in England, for the payment of Mons. Dumas, agent 
in Holland, the sending of expresses, the purchase of a 
large quantity of shoes, which were sent to Nantes, to be 
shipped for America, and for several less disbursements, 
had of Mr Grand only the sum of 244,285 livres, equal to 
the sum often thousand two hundred and sixty one pounds 
ten shillings sterling, which is of itself a demonstration, that 
there was no misapplication of the public monies, since 
Mr Lee has written, that he could not live under three thousand pounds sterling per annum himself. Whether or not 
extravagant prices were given for any of the articles purchased, will be an after consideration. 
</p><p>
Mr Arthur Lee says, " That almost every thing still remains to be paid for." 
</p><p>
I really know not what he means. Things once paid for are not to be paid for a second lime, and the payments Stated above are proved, by Mr Grand's accounts, to have 
been bona fide made. " Bargains," he says, " of the most extravagant kind, have been made with this Mons. Monthieu and others j" and then he proceeds to give an example. 
As to the bargains I was concerned in with this man, and with every other person, I totally deny the fact, and the example given is but a mere pretence. I am so confident 
of the contrary, that I will most cheerfully take every bargain made by me, or with my consent, in Europe, the contract with the Farmers-General excepted, (which was 
partly political at the time,) on myself, and will be bound to abide the profit or loss, leaving them to be judged of by the ablest merchants in Europe. Mr Lee informs us of one 
hundred thousand livres given to Mr Hodge, and that the privateer or vessel he bought cost about £3000, or 72000 livres, and adds, " for what purpose the surplus was given to 
Mr Hodge, how the public came to pay for her refitting, and at length die vessel, and her prize money, made over to Mr Ross and Mr Hodge, without a farthing being brought to 
public account, rests with Mr Deane or Mr Hodge to explain ;" and in a few lines further he says, "you will see my name is not to the contracts ;" but he forgets to add, — 
that he was at Berlin when they were made. What I have already observed upon in Mr Lee's letter, and what I purpose to notice, confirms me in the opinion, which Dr 
Franklin and some others have for some time had of him, that, from a long indulgence of his jealous and suspicious disposition and habits of mind, ho is at last arrived on the 
very borders of insanity, and that at times he even passes the line ; and it gives me pleasure, though it is but a melancholy one, that I can attribute to the misfortunes of 
his head, what I must otherwise place to a depravity of heart. 
</p><p>
Mr Hodge went to Dunkirk, by order of the commissioners. They sent him in consequence of orders from the Secret Committee ; he purchased and fitted out two vessels, 
a fact though forgotten by Mr Lee, known to every one at the time. From what that brave and virtuous young 
American did and suffered on the occasion, it was the common topic of conversation every where ; it raised insurance 
in England ten per cent for a time. Mr Hodge, to appease the British Ambassador, was sent to the Bastile, and Cunningham, making his cruise round England and Ireland, put 
into Spain without prize money equal lo the repairs he wanted. Mr Hodge was released from his imprisonment, and one of the first things he did, was to give Mr Lee the 
account of his whole disbursements in writing. Mr Hodge had taken a small interest in the adventure from the first, and proposed following Cunningham into Spain by land, 
and making a cruise with him. He proposed that Mr Ross and he should purchase the vessel ; but as a price could not 
easily be agreed upon, they proposed to take the vessel as she was, and do the best with her against the common 
enemy, and to account to Congress therefor. Mr Ross desired that such an agreement should be signed by the 
commissioners for his security. I know not that it was ever done. I have only to add on this subject, that all the 
monies received by Mr Hodge amotmted to 92,720 livres 18 3, in the whole, and that Mr Hodge rendered us other services besides equipping these two vessels. 
</p><p>
Speaking of the contracts, he says, " they were in fact concealed from me with the utmost care, as was every 
other means of my knowing how these affairs were conducted." I have in reply to relate the following facts 
which are easy to be ascertained. Mr Lee, on his return from Berlin, wss made acquainted with the contracts ; 
Messrs Holker, (now in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>) Sabbatier and Desprez repeatedly conferred with Mr Lee on the subject in my 
presence, and when they brought in their accounts Mr Lee assisted in adjusting them, and signed with us the orders for 
the payment, as Mr Grand's account and the orders and accounts themselves will show. It is true, the execution of M. Monthieu's contract was not completed, when I left 
Paris, and therefore his accounts could not be settled. Mr Williams had the oversight of repairing the arms in the 
magazine at Nantes ; he settled his accounts with his workmen monthly ; he had a frigate fitting out ibr the commissioners, 10,000 suits of clothes making uj), a number of 
shirts, shoes, etc. together with the charge of all the stores the commissioners were sending to Nantes to be shipped. 
Monthly accounts were not to be expected in reason from a man in such a situation ; it could not be done if promised, 
and Mr Williams is a gentleman of too much probity as well as knowledge in business, to promise what he cannot 
perform. It is not enough to say, that no man in France enjoys a better character for strict honor and ))robity, both 
at Court and in the city, than Mons. Chaumont. Justice must add, there is no man enjoys it perhaps so universally 
through the kingdom, among the merchants, the farmers or husbandmen, and mechanics, in all which branches of business he is constandy speculating. This man is the friend 
of <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> ; I have the pleasure of knowing him to be mine, and what is more, the friend of my country, on all 
and in the most trying occasions. I do not wonder that Mr Lee should appear jealous of this gentleman, as well as of 
every body else, a select few excepted, and very few indeed are those, who escape his jealous suspicions, either in Europe or America. It is a melanclioly tiutli, bul 
justice to the public requires my declaring it, that I never knew Mr Lee, from his first coming to Paris, satisfied 
with any one person he did business with, whether of a public or private nature, and his dealings, whether for trifles 
or for things of importance, almost constantly ended in dispute, sometimes in litigious quarrels. 
</p><p>
Mr Lee lived some time in 31. Chaumont's house. M. Chaumont knew him perfectly well, and was not reserved in speaking his opinion of him. I am sorry to be thus long 
on so disagreeable a subject, a subject which I cautiously waived entering on, in my narration to Congress, not choosing to trouble them with matters, which they might deem of a 
personal nature. I am grieved to have been forced on it at all, and hope never to be obliged to resume it, and as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an 
account, and every thing goes to the debtor credit, the folio for profit or loss, so I must solicit that <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> and the honorable Mr Adams may be directed to see the settlement 
of all those accounts immediately on my return to Paris, 
and as there has been a charge made by Mr Lee, of profusion, of extravagant contracts, and the like, that those gentlemen be authorised to submit the accounts, with every 
allegation of the kind, to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot, and that 
orders may be given, that whatever sum may be found duo from the commissioners may by them be instantly paid 
into the hands of the banker for Congress, and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may 
be the balance, to the person in whose favor the same shall be found. By this means the truth will he demonstrated, 
and justice done, which is all I have ever wished for. Having forgot to mention it in its place, I must be permitted 
to add here, that the first vessel purchased and fitted out by Mr Hodge was, on the return and imprisonment of Cunningham, detained by order from Court, and a second 
purchased, in which Cunningham went on his second cruise. The first was put up for sale at Dunkirk, but not disposed 
of when I left Paris, at least I had not heard of it. 
I have the honor to be,

P. S. I have mentioned money paid Mons. Dumas, as part of the aggregate sum of 244,285 livres 13s. lOd. There 
will be found the sum of <a href='/results.php?year=4351'>4351</a> livres 5s. 3d. paid by Messrs Horneca Fitzeau &i Co. to Mons. Dumas, and for other 
expenses. I fear on a review, that the brevity I aimed at may cause some mistake ; it is therefore proper to observe, 
that but a part of this sum was paid to Mons. Dumas, a part being for other disbursements, independent of which sum the commissioners made other remittances to Mons. Dumas.

</p><p>
In a conference had with Mons. Gerard, in the month of January last, at Versailles, he observed that the thirteenth 
article in the treaty proposed by Congress, which exempted the molasses purchased by the inhabitants of the United 
States in any of the islands belonging to, and subject to, his Most Christian Majesty, from any duties whatever, was an 
unequal article, as he termed it, that without some concession of equal importance on the part of the United States, it 
could not be agreed to, as it would carry the appearance of inequality, and as if Congress were taking the advantage 
and dictating the terms in their own favor, that therefore it was expected, either wholly to omit the article, or place an 
equivalent over against it on our part. 
</p><p>
On my return to Paris, I laid M. Gerard's proposals before my colleagues, who agreed generally to the justice and propriety of them, but we found it difficult to place any 
article or articles over against that of molasses, which would be of equal consequence, and in which the States of America 
were at the same time equally interested. After long consideration had on the subject, <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> proposed the article 
nearly as it now stands ; Mr Lee objected to it, as being too extensive, and more than equivalent for that of molasses 
only ; to which I answered, that though the concession might appear great, it was in reality nothing more than giving up what we never could make use of but to our own prejudice, 
for nothing was more evident than the bad policy of laying duties on our own exports ; that molasses, though apparently but an article of small value, was the basis on which 
a very great part of the American commerce rested ; that the manufacture of it into rum, was every year increasing, especially in the middle and southern states, where it had been more lately introduced. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague'>Doctor Franklin</a> agreed with me, and argued on much the same ground, but neither of us insisted on the article at 
the time, but that the proposition should be made for the consideration of Mons. Gerard, reserving to ourselves the power 
of agreeing to it or not afterwards. A few evenings after, and nearly as I can remember about five or six days before 
the actual signing of the treaty, we met Mons. Gerard at my house in Paris ; he brought the proposed treaty with 
him, ill which he had inserted the 11th and 12th articles as they now stand. The treaty was read, considered, and 
agreed to, article by article, except the 11th and 12th, respecting which M. Gerard observed at first, that he considered them as they then stood reciprocal and equal, but 
that he left it entirely with us to retain them both, or to reject them both, it being indifferent with his Majesty, but 
that one could not be retained without the other. On our having agreed to all the other articles, we told him we 
would confer together on the 11th and 12th, and write to him what our determination should be. As soon as he was 
gone, the subject was taken up ; the arguments before used were again considered, and finally we unanimously agreed 
to retain both the articles ; on which I desired Mr Lee to write a letter to Mons. Gerard, informing him of it, and 
that I would send it out to Versailles the next morning. from Passy, then there might be no more delay in transferring and executing the treaties. Mr Lee accordingly wrote, 
and <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>, he, and myself signed the letter, which I sent the next morning.
</p><p>
A day or two after this, Mr A. Lee wrote a letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> and me, in which he expressed great uneasiness 
about the 11th and 12th articles, and a desire to have them left out, on which we advised Mr Lee to go himself to Versailles on the subject, which he accordingly did, and we 
wrote to M. Gerard, by him, that we were content to have the two articles left out, if agreeable to his Majesty. As we had just before unanimously agreed and written to have 
them retained, we could not, with any consistency, make a point of their being expunged. Mr Lee discoursed on the subject with M. Gerard, who satisfied him as he thought 
at the time, and as we all then thought, of the impropriety of making any alteration in the treaty, after it had been so 
maturely considered ; had been fully agreed upon by us all ; had been approved of in form by his Majesty, and ordered 
to be transcribed and signed. Neither Mr William Lee nor Mr izard ever spoke one word to me on the subject, 
and I did not think myself authorised or at liberty to consult them, or any other person on the subject, but my 
colleagues. ...

Sir, 
</p><p>
I think it unnecessary to make an apology for sending you the enclosed estimates and reflections made on two of the most important and interesting subjects, and for desiring 
the same may be communicated to Congress. Should that honorable body approve of any or all of them, I shall be very lKi|)|)y, and if they should not they will excuse me for 
having given them this trouble, when they reflect, that the desire of throwing some light on these subjects has been my sole motive. 
</p><p>
The providing for the redemption of our money, and the establishment of a marine, are objects, which in my view, far exceed in the magnitude and extent of their importance, and that are at present under public consideration ; they 
greatly depend on each other, and permit me to say, all our future operations in a great degree depend on them. We 
cannot pay the interest of any considerable loan without commerce, which cannot be revived effectually without a marine force of our own, which may I am confident be formed on the enclosed plan, and be ready in a short space 
of time to act with vigor. Great Britain has long had the empire of the ocean, and in consequence the whole world has been her tributary ; her own bad policy and the present war will deprive her of that empire at this important crisis 
it depends on the measures taken by the United States, whether they shall succeed Great Britain or not in this 
extensive dominion. Reason, observation, and experience authorise me to say, there is not in the world any power so 
capable of it, and as the United States can never aim at foreign conquests, but simply to guard their own coasts, 
and to protect the commerce of their subjects, their superiority at sea can never give just cause of jealousy or offence 
to any other nation. I am confident that a fleet of forty sail, to consist of twenty such large ships as I have described, and twenty frigates, will be more than equal to this purpose, and such a fleet may be got to sea in the course 
of the coming year, if the materials wanted from Europe can be procured, which, if immediately applied for, I have not the least doubt of.

I have the honor to remain, etc.

After writing the above, my apprehension, lest I should be thought any way out of the usual course in communicating my sentiments to Congress, made me omit sending it to 
you with the enclosed, but the alarming intelligence, which I received but a day or two since, of the sentiments of my countrymen in different parts on the present situation of the 
credit of our money, the state of our finances and resources, and of the temper and disposition prevailing in consequence, has made me waive every personal consideration, 
and communicate ibis with the enclosed to Congress, and I shall count it one of the happiest occurrences of my life, if 
anything in my power will help to prevent that total loss of public as well as private credit, which I am sorry to find 
begins to be almost universally apprehended, and I fear appearances at this time are in support of such apprehensions, which though at bottom they may be ill founded, yet, 
if once generally prevailing, will. produce consequences easily foreseen. I beg leave to refer to Colonel Duer for 
the substance of the intelligence I refer to, having communicated the letters I have received to him, for as they contain many things merely personal, I could not lay them at large before Congress.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor of writing to you on the 7th of October last, and having since received a letter from Mr Williams, I send it enclosed, to show Congress that the 
monies mentioned by Mr A. Lee, in his letter of the 1st of June last, to have been received by that gentleman, have, in the opinion of two of the commissioners, been well laid out 
and faithfully accounted for. It gives me great pleasure to find, that the clothes contracted for by Mons. Monthieu, Messrs Holker, Sabbatier, and Desprez, and others, are 
on examination approved of, and allowed to be the best of the kind, both as to the quality of the cloth and fashion they are made in, of any that have ever been 
imported ; it is indeed a fortunate circumstance, that out of near forty thousand suits so few have been intercepted. As Mr A. Lee, in his letters, has insinuated that the contracts 
for these clothes were made entirely by me, and has charged me with great extravagance in them, I beg leave to inform Congress, that these suits complete, and delivered on board, 
do not cost, on an average, thirty-six livres, or thirty-one shillings and sixpence sterling the suit. I labored hard to send over shoes, stockings, and shirts in proportion, and so 
far as it was effected, the suit complete, with shoes, stockings and shirt, does not amount in the whole to forty shillings sterling. These facts being known, I am content to 
take on myself the merit or demerit of furnishing these supplies. 
</p><p>
I will make no comment on the dismission of a man of Mr Williams' known abilities, integrity, and economy, and who did the business of the public for two per cent, to make 
room for the deputies of Mr William Lee, who shares five per cent with them, nor on the still more unaccountable conduct of Mr A. Lee, in ordering bills accepted by Messrs 
Franklin and Adams to be protested. It gives me pain to be forced to lay these facts before Congress, but I cannot, consistent with the duty I owe my country, nor with the justice 
due myself, permit them, and others of the like nature, to remain longer concealed from public view and examination. 
</p><p>
My letter of the 7th ult. covered observations on Mr Lee's and Mr Izard's letters to Congress, to which I am still without the honor of any reply ; nothing would give me greater 
satisfaction, than to learn by what part of my public conduct I have merited the neglect, with which my letters and most respectful solicitations for months past, to be heard before 
Congress, have been treated. I confess that I once flattered myself the services I performed in procuring supplies, and sending them to the United States at the most critical 
period of their affairs, and in assisting to bring forward and conclude the treaties, together with the honorable testimonials from the Court of France, whilst I had the honor of 
residing there, would have merited the approbation of Congress. And I now leave it with every person of sensibility 
and honor, to imagine what must be my disappointment and chagrin, to find myself obliged at last to leave America without being informed if exceptions have been taken to 
any part of my conduct, or what they may be. Thus situated, though I can but feel most sensibly, yet a consciousness of 
the integrity and zeal, which have ever guided and animated my conduct, and a sense of the important services I have 
been so fortunate as to render my country, with the confidence I have that justice will yet be done me, support and 
will never permit me to forget or desert myself or my country, whilst in my power to be useful. 
</p><p>
I took the liberty on the 12th instant, in writing to Congress, again to remind them of my being without any answer to my request, and having written already repeatedly, I 
will not trouble that honorable body further on the subject of my being heard, agreeable to what by their resolutions which recalled me, and since I hoped for, and had reason 
to expect ; but praying them to accept my sincere thanks for the honor they did me, in appointing me their commercial and political agent in Europe, and afterwards one of 
their commissioners to the Court of France, by which I have had an opportunity of rendering my country important services, I have only to repeat my former request, that 
orders may be given to their minister at the Court of France to have my accounts examined and settled, immediately on my return thither, referring to my letter of the 7th, on 
that head, and entreating for a speedy resolution on the subject. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to remain.

P. S. Since writing the above, I am informed that letters have been received from the honorable Mr Lee, and read in Congress, which mention certain proceedings of 
Mr Hodge, and that a sum of money had been paid Mr S. Wharton by my order, without the knowledge of the commissioners, and which I left unexplained and unaccounted 
for. I will only say here, that any insinuation of this kind is totally groundless, and makes me feel most sensibly what I suffer by not being permitted to be heard before Congress, 
which I still solicit for. S. D.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I am still so unhappy, as to be without the honor of any reply to the several letters I have written through you to 
Congress, praying that honorable body to favor me with an audience, and that they would give the necessary orders to 
their ministers or commissioners at the Court of Versailles to examine, adjust, and settle my accounts immediately on 
my return to France. I take the liberty now to add to what I have already written, that the hopes of being favored 
with an audience have already occasioned my losing several very agreeable and safe opportunities of returning, until the 
season has become as pressing as the business which calls me back, and obliges me most earnestly to entreat the attention of Congress to my situation and requests. 
I have the honor to remain, etc.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have now to acknowledge your favors of 10 o'clock last evening, and to thank you for the attention paid to my 
last letter to you. Previous to receiving the intimation you have given me, "that Congress had resolved to take into 
consideration their foreign affairs, and that such branches as I had been particularly concerned in, would in due 
course become subjects of deliberation," I had prepared to leave this city, and had made my arrangements accordingly, 
which it will not be in my power to dispense with for any time. I take the liberty of mentioning this, as I do not 
find in the intimation you have given me of the resolution of Congress any time fixed for my attendance, and I take 
the liberty of repeating what I have before had the honor of writing to you, that my detention is extremely prejudicial to 
my private affairs, and, so far as I am able to judge, in some degree so to those of the public, which I have had the 
honor of being intrusted with, some of which require my presence at the settlement of them, as well on account of 
ray own reputation, as for the interest of the United States. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with much respect, etc.

Sir, 
</p><p>
In obedience to the orders of Congress of the 7th Inst. I have now committed to writing as particular an account of my agency of their affairs in Europe as my situation will 
permit, and wait the pleasure of Congress to lay the same before them. And I have only to request, that the letters written by the commissioners to Congress, or the Committee 
of Foreign Affairs, during my agency or since, which refer thereto, ordered to be read in Congress, may be laid on their table, when I shall have the honor to be admitted. I 
request this, from my not having the copies of those letters with me, to which the accounts I am directed to give refer, but recollecting the substance of them, I have judged it 
unnecessary to trouble Congress for copies of them at present, as it might cause some delay, and I am anxious to complete as soon as possible the information expected from 
me. I flatter myself that an early day will be fixed, and if I may take the liberty to mention one, I wish it may be tomorrow if consistent with the business of Congress. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the utmost respect, &c.

Sir,

When I had the honor of waiting on Congress last, I was informed that I should be favored with an opportunity of finishing my narrative without delay. I now take the 
liberty of applying to Congress, and to inform them that I am ready, and wait their orders. I have received letters, which I am desirous to communicate personally; they 
relate to parts of my narrative. My solicitude for a final issue of my affairs will, I trust, not appear unreasonable to Congress, when it is considered that a certain Mr Thomas Paine, styling himself Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and presuming to address the public in his official character, 
has thrown out in a late paper many insinuations injurious to my public character, and has avowed his intentions of laying before die public a number of interesting facts, and 
materials, relative to my conduct, as one of the commissioners of these United States at the Court of France. 
</p><p>
I rely on the justice of Congress, and have the honor to be, etc.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
In my letter of the 30th ult. I took the liberty of mentioning to Congress a circumstance, which made me very 
solicitous for a final issue of my affairs, which was the illiberal and abusive attacks made on my character, as the 
public agent and minister of these States, by a certain Mr Thomas Paine, styling himself Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and pretending to address the public in his official 
capacity. This person has since, in Mr Dunlap's paper of the 2d inst, ventured to assure the public, that the supplies, which I contracted for with Mons. Beaumarchais, were 
promised and engaged, and that as a present, before I arrived in France, and that he has in his possession full proof of this. 
</p><p>
I cannot suppose that Mr Paine is possessed of any letters, or papers on this subject, which are not 
before Congress, or to which the honorable members are strangers. I will not trouble Congress with any observations on the many groundless and extravagant assertions 
of this writer, but justice to my own character obliges me to entreat, that, if what he has asserted on this subject is a 
fact, I may be made acquainted with it. Mons. Beaumarchais, in his letter to Congress of the 23d of March last, 
asserts directly the contrary to what this man has ventured to publish ; and as my engagements with Mons. Beaumarchais were made on a very different ground, it is of the last importance to me to know if I have been deceived in the 
whole of this transaction, and how, that I may be able to regulate my conduct accordingly. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the utmost respect, etc.

When I had the honor of waiting on Congress, you were pleased to inform me, that if Congress had any further 
commands for me I should be notified thereof. Not having received any notice from you on the subject, I take the 
liberty to inform you, that my affairs are become so pressing and so peculiarly circumstanced, that it is impossible 
for me to attend longer without doing greater prejudice to myself and interest, than I am able to sustain. I must 
therefore request of you to remind Congress of my situation, and that you will inform me of their determination respecting me.

France, to transact important business for them, in the commercial as well as political departments, and that I have 
ever since been in their service, in which I flatter myself I have been of some utility to them and to my country ; but that an absence of almost four years from my family 
and private affairs, more than seven months of which I have waited to know their pleasure respecting me here, has so exceedingly embarrassed and distressed me, that I hope I 
shall not be deemed guilty of an unbecoming impatience in pressing to know, if Congress have any further commands for me, and in what manner my past transactions, as their 
agent and commissioner, are to be adjusted and closed. I have heretofore written repeatedly and particularly to Congress on this subject, and will not enlarge upon it at present,

for eight months past has been peculiarly distressing, is now become such as to oblige me to leave this city without further delay, and therefore I again most respectfully entreat 
of Congress to inform me, if they expect further information from me respecting their foreign or other affairs, and as I 
shall without loss of time, return to Europe, that I may be informed if they have any further commands for my service, 
and in what manner my past transactions, as their agent and commissioner, are to be adjusted and closed.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor of writing to your Excellency the 22d of February last, in which I mentioned the distressed situation into which my affairs were brought, by my being 
detained in this city, and in which I earnestly requested to know of Congress whether they had any further commands for me, and in what manner my past transactions, as their 
agent and commissioner, were to be adjusted and closed. You were pleased to inform me verbally, that n)y letter was referred to the committee, who were ordered to report 
immediately. I have since been informed that they have reported, but that the report has not been considered by Congress, nor any resolutions passed thereon. This forces 
me again to apply to Congress, and to lay before that honorable body in part my situation. I have been near four 
years absent from my family and private affairs, which have suffered exceedingly thereby ; more than three years of the time, I have been in the actual service of Congress. 
</p><p>
The settlement of the commissioners' accounts and my own, will show to demonstration, that I have received nothing therefor, except money for my necessary expenses. 
When the orders of Congress, and the service of these Stales required my immediate return, I took with me one hundred and eighty loiiis d'ors or guineas only, to defray 
my expenses and those of four Americans and a servant to America. Two of the Americans were captains in the navy of the United States, and had escaped from prison in 
England ; of the other two, one had been taken in a private ship of war, which he commanded, and had also escaped 
from prison ; the other was a captain in the merchant service. Our journey to Toulon, which is near six hundred 
miles, was expensive, and was defrayed by me ; our passage from Toulon to America was at the expense of His Most 
Christian Majesty. I took those American captains with me by the advice and at the desire of the ministers of France, 
and of <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>, these captains being well acquainted with the American coast. I have been for more than eight months past in this city, and at an expense to which my 
private fortune is by no means adequate, though I have regulated my expenses by the strictest economy my situation 
could admit of. I will not trouble Congress with mentioning what has past since my return. The loss of my private 
property is of no consideration with me, if my country is in any way essentially served thereby ; but whilst Congress 
defer coming to any resolution respecting my private services as their agent and commissioner, what is dearer to me 
than life or fortune, my character, is attacked and liable to suffer, from the groundless and base insinuations of some, 
and from the open calumnies of others. I cannot but think it an act of justice due not only to n,e as an individual, but 
to Congress and the public in general, that my conduct be either approved of or censured ; I have most surely merited one or the other, from the important part I have acted, 
and the manner in which I have transacted it. I had the 
honor of bringing with me testimonials, not only from my late venerable colleague, but from bis Most Christian Majesty and bis ministers, in favor of my conduct whilst in 
France ; they have been long since laid before Congress, and I cannot but conceive, that if I have merited the calumnies which have for some months past been publicly thrown 
out against me, and industriously spread through these States, justice to those great personages, who condescended 
to interest themselves so warmly in my favor, requires that my demerits should be publicly known and made to appear, 
that they may no longer be deceived, or in a state of uncertainty, respecting my real character and merits. 
</p><p>
A writer, who has been busily employed for three months 
past in inventing and publishing the most scandalous falsehoods, in order to injure me in the opinion of my countrymen, has produced in Dunlap's paper of the 27th inst two 
charges against me, the one for "negotiating an intended present into a loan,"" or, in other words, of defrauding my honorable constituents of a large sum of money ; the other 
of intercepting and destroying the public despatches in order to cover the fraud. This writer has not long since been in the employ of Congress as a secretary or clerk, of 
which circumstance he avails himself to give force to his calumnies, and has had the confidence to appeal to Congress for the truth of his assertions, though he knew at the 
time that Congress had unanimously contradicted the first, and that the latter was but the creature of bis own forming. From the moment that I was ordered by Congress to lay 
before them in writing, a narration of my public transactions, I have considered myself as being before that tribunal and no other, and under their immediate protection, 
and consequently not at liberty to take that notice of the publications of this writer, or of his prompters, which, as an individual, other ways circumstanced, I should have took 
long since. This consideration, and the full reliance I have ever placed on the justice of Congress, have prevented my making any reply to the many base and false insinuations 
thrown out by this writer, and others, against me, and I have been encouraged to wait with patience for the decision of Congress, by repeated promises, that a speedy issue 
should be made of those affairs. 
</p><p>
I now submit it to that honorable body, whether, if my patience is exhausted, I ought to be deemed culpable ; and 
have further to entreat, that if Congress, or any of its members, entertain any apprehensions, that I am guilty of the 
two charges brought against me, (to which I have referred) or on any other account whatever, that I may be heard 
before Congress, and I submit it to their wisdom to determine how public the inquiry shall be, assuring them, that 
the more public the scrutiny shall be into every part of my conduct, the more agreeable it will be to me. I have 
only to entreat further, that a decisive answer may be given to me on the above requests, and that you will be assured of my unalterable respect and attachment.

Sir,

I am without an answer to the letter I did myself the honor of writing to you the 30th ult. As I shall be obliged to leave <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> in a few days at farthest, I have again 
to solicit a decisive reply to my last. Justice to ray fortune as well as character requires it, and I can by no means bring myself to suppose, that Congress will ever refuse the doing 
of justice either to the character or fortune of any free citizen of these States, much less that they will any longer delay it to one in their service, and under their immediate 
protection, and who has for many months past been soliciting for justice, as well to his fortune as character.

I ask liberty to refer to the two last letters, which I did myself the honor of writing to you on the 30th ult. and 2d 
instant, and which remain unanswered. In them I mentioned the situation to which I was brought by my being detained in this city, the difficulties and distresses of which 
have been ever since daily increasing. 
</p><p>
I will not take up the time of Congress by entering into a detail of circumstances ; many of the honorable members are not unacquainted with them, but inform Congress that I 
am under the necessity of going out of town early in next week, and considering myself at the orders of Congress, pray to be informed if they have any commands for me, 
which render it necessary that I defer any longer to leave <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. My own family and private affairs, as well as those of one intrusted to my care, have long suffered by 
my absence ; they must suffer to the last degree, if longer neglected.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
As I have received no reply to my letters of the 30th ult. and 2d instant, I take the liberty of applying again to 
Congress, to remind them of my situation. It is now more than twelve months since, in obedience to their orders, I 
left France, to return to my native country. Having employed the short interval, between the receiving advice of 
my recall and my embarking, in soliciting essential aid and succor for these States, I entered on my voyage with the 
pleasing reflection, that after a two years' faithful service, in a most difficult and embarrassed negotiation, the issue had 
been fortunate, equal to my utmost wishes ; that the supplies I had procured, and sent out, had enabled my brave countrymen and fellow citizens to resist and humble the enemy ; that the treaty which I had the honor, with my colleagues, 
to conclude, had engaged one of the most powerful and generous princes in the world lo guaranty the liberties and independence of these States. 
</p><p>
The great and seasonable aid sent out by him, with which (after having received the most honorable testimonials of his 
approbation, and men of his esteem, as well as that of his ministers, and of my late worthy colleague and friend, <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>) I had the honor to embark, gave me in prospect the completion of my most sanguine hopes — the total reduction of the British force in North America. Unfortunately the length of our passage defeated the most essential objects of this great and well concerted enterprise. Extensive 
and important services were however thereby rendered, on which I need not be particular. Immediately on my landing in America, I repidred with all possible despatch to 
Congress, to inform them of the state of affairs in Europe, which I had been advised, by their resolution, was the business I was ordered to return upon. Between my arrival in 
this city, on the 13th of June, and my audience before Congress, on the 21st of August, I was informed that the minds, of s:) ue i)f my countrymen were prejudiced against me, and 
til it iiisi I I itiOMS were iiidiisli'ioiisly circulated to effect ,.;:->•••: ! t i.;i'ef )ro t xik t';).: eariiesl opportunity given me, 
vng hiid l»L'i''!e Congress a general state of ,o,i;iid;,i ;iifair-. ■.\in\ of li:} p ■>' > edings, to request that if any 
ihlng had been laid to my v . ariie, or suirgested to my disadvantage, I might be made acquainted therewith, for that it 
was probable that in the difficult, complicated, and embarrassed scenes I had gone through, many things might require 
explanation. I received no reply, and continuing to solicit to have the business I returned upon concluded, I was 
informed that an honorable member produced in Congress 
an extract from a letter from a private gentleman, respecting a conversation which passed between him and Mr Carmichael, which implied a censure on my conduct. On the 
26th of September, Mr Secretary Thompson acquainted me with the resolution of Congress of that day, to postpone futrher consideration of my requests, until the examination of William Carmichael. 
</p><p>
What the result of that examination was I never knew, but having waited some days, the urgent necessity for my 
speedy return pressing on me, I applied again, and repeatedly, that I might finish the business upon which I had been 
sent for. Days were repeatedly appointed for that purpose, and I must suppose business of more importance prevented. 
In those letters I laid before Congress the unsettled state in which I had, by my sudden departure, been obliged to leave 
the accounts and other mercantile transactions of the commissioners, and pointed out the injuries, which the public 
must suffer by a delay of their settlement, as well as the personal inconveniences I must be subjected to whilst they 
remained unsettled. To these letters I beg leave to refer. In October, extracts from letters from Mr Arthur Lee and 
AJr Izard, were, by order of Congress, delivered mo, to which I replied at large, on the 12th and 22d of the same 
month; my letters are still before Congress, and to them I refer, particularly to that of the 12th, which closes in these words ; 
</p><p>
"As in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account, and every thing goes to the debit or credit, the folio for profit or loss, so I must solicit that <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> 
and Mr Adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to Paris, 
and as there has been a charge made by Mr Lee, of profusion, of extravagant contracts, and the like, that those gentlemen be authorised to submit those accounts, with every 
allegation of the kind, to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot, and that orders may be given, that whatever may be found due from 
the commissioners, or either of them, may be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for Congress, and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may 
be the balance, to the person in whose favor the same shall be found. By this means truth will be demonstrated, and justice done, which is all I have ever wished for." 
</p><p>
In December last I was directed to lay before Congress in writing, a narrative of my proceedings, whilst their commercial and political agent, etc. I must ask leave to refer 
to that narrative at large, as many of the honorable members then in Congress are now absent, and the representatives of several of the States entirely changed. On a 
reference it will be found, that I again solicited for as early a decision as possible on my conduct, that the most thorough examination might be made, and to demonstrate 
what my 'commercial conduct had been whilst the agent of these States, that my accounts might be put in the way of being settled without delay, that the part I had acted, and 
the station I had been in, could not be considered as a neutral or indifferent one, and that approbation or censure was my due, etc. &.c. When I was favored with that 
audience, I flattered myself that the delays I had met with had given ample time for the most full and perfect scrutiny . into every part of my conduct, and that if any charges were 
to be brought against any part of my conduct, I should then be informed of them. I therefore again requested to know if there were any. I was informed of none. Soon 
after I was told that a committee was appointed to examine into, and report on foreign affairs. I previously informed Congress, that I had no copies of the letters written to them 
by the commissioners, from Paris ; that <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague'>Doctor Franklin</a> took the care of them, and that my having no apprehension of being questioned on them, I had not taken duplicates 
with me, therefore requested that I might have copies of them, that I might explain anything which might at first sight appear dubious or contradictory. 
</p><p>
I afterwards applied to the members of the honorable committee, desiring that if in the course of their examination, anything should appear doubtful, or such as might 
support a charge against any part of my conduct, I might be heard, before any report should be made. I did not receive copies of the letters, nor was I ever called upon by 
the committee, who I am informed have made their report, as to which I am wholly uninformed. Soon after this report was delivered to Congress, having been persecuted 
in the public papers for several months, in the most scandalous, virulent, and licentious manner, and accused before 
the public of crimes of the blackest complexion, I again addressed myself to Congress, and as their servant claimed their protection, and that I might be heard in the most public 
manner, or in any other way they thought proper. This letter, of the 30th of March, remains unanswered, and I now pray the contents of it may be considered. The part 
I acted as political agent and commissioner for Congress is well known, and may be judged of with certainly at this time, and the settlement of mine and the commissioners' 
accounts (which I have repeatedly solicited) will demonstrate what my commercial conduct has been. If, in^e commercial, I have not acted with prudence and integrity, 
if I have neglected lo supply these States with stores to the utmost of my power, and have either wasted or embezzled the public monies, the interest of the public requires that 
speedy justice be done, and the settlement of the commissioners' accounts will at once acquit or condemn me. If in my political department I have in any instance neglected 
or betrayed the interests of my country, if I have conducted weakly or wickedly, or both, the public ought to know it, 
and I ought to be punished. If, on the contrary, I sacrificed all private considerations, and put my life as well as 
fortune to the hazard, to procure relief and assistance for these States from abroad ; if, unsupported by remittances from hence, without credit or friends, and a stranger to the 
language and manners of the country I was sent to negotiate in, I surmounted every obstacle, and in a few months 
obtained and sent out large supplies ; if I was assiduous and indefatigable for the space of near two years in France, in 
the commercial as well as political affairs of these States, at times even to my personal danger ; if, so far from having embezzled the public monies, I neglected my private 
fortune, and received nothing but my necessary expenses whilst transacting this business; if a principal share of the 
political negotiations fell on me, and if jointly with my colleagues I brought them to a happy and honorable issue, and individually acquired the confidence and esteem of 
His Most Christian Majesty and his minister's, as well as of the nation in general ; and if, at my private solicitations (in 
part) after my recall, a strong fleet and armament were sent out to the relief of these Slates ; if these are facts, which they certainly are, and the greater part of them long since 
further ascertained, and the others ascertainable by the settlement of the commissioners' accounts, (which I have from the first requested) I flatter myself justice will be done by 
Congress, and that the artifices of interested and wicked men will not prevail to delay it, and thereby injure the public and their servant more essentially, than injustice itself would do. 
</p><p>
I, therefore, with the sensibility of an innocent yet injured man, and with the firmness of a free independent citizen, ask for justice, fully confident that Congress will not refuse 
or delay it. I owe too much to those great personages, who generously patronized and protected me in Europe, to my countrymen and to myself, to suffer my character and 
conduct to remain longer under any uncertainty. When the part I acted abroad in the service of these States, my recall, the circumstances of my return, my reception, and 
the delays I have since met with, are reviewed, I think my case will be found peculiar. 
</p><p>
Permit me then to repeat, that my services have been in two departments, political and commercial ; every thing respecting the first is already well known, the closing of the 
accounts will demonstrate what the latter has been ; on the first, Congress is now able to judge ; justice to the public, as well as to myself, calls for their determination. If there 
are charges against me in either of the characters I have supported, I must consider myself entitled to know what they arc, and to be permitted to answer. 
</p><p>
I cannot close this letter without complaining to Congress of the abuse I have met with in the public papers from a writer, who was lately their confidential servant, and who 
has abused their confidence to deceive and impose on the free citizens of these States, and to injure me in the public opinion ; also of the parii^d and injurious manner in which 
I have been treated by others who, deeply interested by 
family and other connexions to support my enemies, represent my conduct and the letters written by the commissioners and myself, as inconsistent and contradictory, whilst 
I remain deprived of any opportunity to explain them. My utmost ambition and wishes have ever been to serve these States, and to merit the title of their faithful and approved 
servant ; nothing can deprive me of the consciousness of having served faithfully and with integrity. If my country have no further service for me, my first object as well as 
ray duty must be to justify my conduct, and to rescue my reputation and character from the injury and abuse of wicked men, and to do this I again ask of Congress, what 
I consider as my right, their decision on my conduct as their servant ; and if any part thereof is questioned, I may be permitted to explain and vindicate the same, which I 
have often said and again repeat, the settlement of the commissioners' accounts will enable me to do, even to mathematical demonstration. Any further delay in my case must 
have all the consequences of a refusal, and as I have ever relied with confidence on the justice of Congress, and long waited their decision, I flatter myself it will no longer be 
postponed. I shall leave <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> in the course of this week on my private affairs, and wish to do it as early as possible. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with much respect, &c.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I heard yesterday, by accident, that an honorable gentleman in Congress had made a calculation from the general account, which I gave in my narrative of the price of the clothes purchased in France, and that given by M. Holker, in a memorial of his, and had drawn consequences very injurious to me there from. In my narrative 
I informed Congress that the clothes cost 32s. or 33s. sterling complete, delivered on board. This was nearly the 
average price, and of that, and not of the particular, I spoke. 32s. sterling is equal to 36 livres, I 1 sols, 5 deniers. The 
clothes bought of Messrs Sabbatier and Desprez cost 36 livres nearest, delivered on board ; those of Mons. Monthieu a few sols more ; those by Mr Williams, the same, 
nearly as I recollect ; and about a thousand suits of M. Coder, of a different fashion, more than 40 livres each. I have before related to Congress, that Mr Lee himself approved of these purchases, having been present at the contracting of a part of them, those of M. Coder in particular, and had signed the settlement of the accounts, and orders or draughts for the money. 
</p><p>
Surprised at the calculation made, and the injurious inferences drawn therefrom, I wrote to M. Holker the 
enclosed letter, and received his answer thereto, a copy of which I take the liberty of enclosing. 37 livres being 
equal to 32s. 4 l-2d. sterling, it is evident that the calculation made is wrong, even if I had fixed the price positively at 32s. or 33s. sterling. 
</p><p>
I will not trouble Congress at present with any further observations on the subject. 
</p><p>
But am, with much respect, etc.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I was this day surprised to hear, that in a memorial you had presented to Congress, you had said that the suits of 
clothes furnished by Messrs Sabbatier and Desprez, ought not to cost (or did not cost) more than 32 or 34 livres 
each, delivered in the ports of France. Permit me to remind you, that these clothes were transported from Paris, 
and the other places where they were made up, to the sea ports, at the expense of the commissioners ; that they cost 
something more than 34 livres, exclusive of the transportation, as I am positive the accounts themselves will show. 
I must therefore presume, if my information is right, that you may be under some mistake as to this matter, and 
therefore pray you, if you have the copies of these accounts, that you will turn to them, which must convince you of it, 
or the error is with me, for, as I recollect, these suits of clothes cost, when delivered on board, nearest 36 livres on 
an average, and those purchased from Mons. Monthieu, a trifle more, and those from M. Coder, which were of a different fashion, considerably more ; this occasioned my 
saying generally, in my narrative to Congress, that the suits cost 32s. or 33s. sterling, of which difference in our 
accounts advantage has been taken against me, though I spoke generally, referring to the accounts and contracts 
themselves to correct me if I erred. You will therefore oblige me by explaining the above, if you have the account, or if you recollect the circumstances of that transaction.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
In my letter of Monday last, I mentioned my intention to leave town in the course of the week. I am now waiting for no other purpose, but to know if Congress will take 
notice of the requests I have so often troubled them with. The circumstances under which I left France, in obedience to their orders, and with a view of promoting their service 
in the greatest and most essential manner (it is well known) rendered it impossible (o have the accounts of the commissioners and my own, connected immediately with theirs, 
settled and closed, so that the vouchers could be procured and brought out with me. But a few days past between 
the knowledge of my recall, and of my actual setting out on my return. 
</p><p>
One condition of sending out the Toulon fleet, and of my embarking in it was, that the most profound secrecy 
should be observed, and the greatest despatch made. The king's ministers did not think fit to communicate this secret 
to my colleague, Mr Lee, nor did they leave me at liberty 
to do it ; I had as little grounds for confidence in that gentleman, as the ministers had, and it is evident from their 
letters and declarations that they never had any. Yet such is my peculiar situation, that I find myself blamed and 
censured by many in Congress as well as out, for not having performed an impossibility, and am represented as 
a defaulter, and as having misapplied or embezzled the public monies, at once to prevent my future usefulness to my country, and to the ruin of my private fortune and 
character. Thus situated, I can but appeal once more to the justice of Congress, and remind them that I brought with me and delivered them, it is now more than seven 
months since, an account from under the banker's hands, of all the monies received and paid out by him, and to whom paid; that in my letter of the 12th of October, I 
explained to Congress for what purposes those payments were made, and in my answers to Mr Lee's objections to these contracts, that I proved him to have been acquainted 
with them, and that he signed himself the orders for the money, for the greater part of them. I am informed, by several honorable gentlemen in Congress, that many of the 
members, from their absence at the time, or from their taking their seats since the delivering in of that account and my letter of the 12th of October, are to this moment 
uninformed of either. This obliges me to refer to them at this time, and though I have not the vouchers to support 
every article, yet I will cheerfully put my reputation as a merchant, as an honest man, and as a frugal servant of the 
public, on the examination of those accounts, the circumstances under which they were taken, at the same time to be considered. 
</p><p>
That account commences in February, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>, and ends the 27th day of March, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, three days before my leaving 
Paris. It will show, that the whole amount of the monies received by the commissioners, was 3,753,250 livres, and 
their expenditures 4,046,988 livres, 7 sols, and by the general state of the account delivered the 12th of October, it appears for what those expenditures were made. After 
deducting the sums paid for large contracts for supplies, &c. which are particularised, there will be left 219,250 
livres, I sol, 11 deniers, equal to £<a href='/results.php?year=9044'>9044</a>. 8. 7 1-2 sterling, for the commissioners' expenses, for almost fifteen months, 
and for small purchases, and for a variety of services not possible to be particularised, without the accounts at large. I might with safety rest this whole sum on the score of the 
commissioners' expenses for this space of time, and support it on Mr Lee's letter to Congress, in which he says, that Mr Adams and himself were fully convinced, that they could 
not live at Paris under £<a href='/results.php?year=3000'>3000</a> sterling, (or about 70,000 livres) each annually. Had the commissioners expended 
at that rate, from February, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>, to March, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, the 
whole of the sum would be no more than a sufficiency to supply their expenses ; but this was not the case. The commissioners, in the whole, received out of it the sum of I 1 5,480 
livres, 5 sols, 6 deniers, for their expenses and private disbursements, as will appear by the account enclosed ; of 
this, <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> received 27,841 livres, Mr Lee 52,039 livres, 5 sols, 9 deniers, and myself 35,600 livres. It is 
true, at the same time, that Mr Lee had in his hands the whole of the money received from Spain, which he disposed of without the interference of the other commissioners. 
</p><p>
I appeal to the honorable gentlemen in Congress, then present, and perfectly well acquainted with our mode and 
style of living, to inform Congress on which of the commissioners the greatest expense of providing for and entertaining the Americans, who visited them at Paris, or who escaped 
from prison in England, and applied for relief, fell. I lay this general state before Congress, to convince them how very far I was from being prodigal of the public monies, 
and that the accounts delivered, general as they are, are sufficient to exculpate me from every charge of peculation or extravagance. My future reputation and fortune depend 
much on my mercantile character in these transactions, and I rely on the justice of Congress to prevent its being any longer undeservedly sported with, vilified and abused. 
</p><p>
Under the load of calumny and abuse I have for some 
months sustained, I have had this consolation, that the services I had rendered my country had been long since sensibly felt by her, and that they would one day be acknowledged, but when returning to the character of a private citizen in the mercantile line, I cannot sit down easy under 
imputations injurious to my private character. 
</p><p>
I have long since requested to have these accounts examined into, on the spot, where only a full and minute 
investigation can be made, and that they should be settled as justice required. I now repeat my request, and that 
previous thereto, the accounts laid before Congress be examined, from which alone it will appear, if there be any 
ground even for suspicion, and that I may be permitted to 
obviate, if in my power here, any objections that may be 
made. The mode in which the monies were received, for 
the commissioners' use at Paris, the source from whence 
they came, with other circumstances relative, are such that 
I have not thought it consistent with the interest, the policy, 
or even the delicacy of Congress, or others, to lay the case 
at large before my countrymen, though I found myself 
injured in their opinion, by the abuse constantly thrown out 
against me in the papers, and from my silence on the subject. I have ever been, and still remain confident, that a 
general examination of the accounts, even in the state they 
are, must prove satisfactory to Congress, and that a minute 
investigation will show me to have merited their approbation, and not their censure. My first duty is, to satisfy 
Congress, in whose determinations the public will undoubtedly acquiesce, and to them therefore I have constantly 
made my application on this subject. 
</p><p>
I will make no apology for troubling them so long at this 
time, my situation is, I trust, a sufficient one. I have only 
to add, that having delayed to leave the town beyond the 
time I proposed in my last, I hope for an early answer, 
and have the honor to be, with the utmost respect and 
attachment, &.c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
As this will probably be the last time I shall trouble Congress with my addresses to them, I hope to be indulged in 
briefly laying before them the following observations on my case and situation. 
</p><p>
From the moment, that the contest between these States and Great Britain became serious, I have taken and pursued 
a decided and active part in favor of the liberties of my country, have cheerfully sacrificed my fortune, and exposed 
my life, for an object much dearer to me than either, the peace, liberty, and safety of these States. The part I took 
in the first, and succeeding Congress, is well known to many of the honorable members now present, as well as to my 
countrymen and fellow citizens in general, who must do me the justice to say, that I let slip no opportunity either in 
Congress or out, which offered, for serving America, and distressing its enemies. 
</p><p>
In January, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>, when I was about returning to my family and private concerns, which had suffered much by my 
absence, I was applied to, by the committee of Congress, to 
go to France, to negotiate the political as well as commercial affairs of America in that kingdom. The advantages 
proposed to me in the latter were considerable, and without any probability of difficulty, embarrassment, or risk, further 
than the dangers of the voyage, which were indeed great at 
that time. In the former it was very different, but the difficulties which presented, great as they were, had no consideration with me, in the situation in which our affairs then 
were. My subsequent conduct, from my arrival in France, until I left that kingdom, fully demonstrates that private 
interest and personal safety never had any weight with me, when the service of my country called upon me. In my 
narrative I have been so particular on the situation I found myself in, on my arrival in Europe, the embarrassments and 
difficulties I constantly labored under, and had to encounter, and in the many letters I have written to Congress since 
my return, requesting my conduct might be examined, in 
the strictest and most public manner, I have so often represented to them what my situation and line of conduct had 
ever been, that I am under no necessity of saying anything on the subject at present. 
</p><p>
On the fourth of March, 177S, after having succeeded in procuring supplies for these States, which fell almost solely 
on me, and having, jointly with my colleagues, concluded the 
treaty of the sixth of February, which secured and guarantied the independence of these Slates, when I found myself, 
for the first time after my leaving America, free from those 
distressing embarrassments and difficulties I had been constantly under, and at liberty to pursue openly the great objects 
in view, and which I had for some time contemplated for 
the service of these State?, I received the resolution of Congress of the 8th of December, ordering me to return immediately to America, to inform Congress of the state of foreign affairs in Europe. I did not hesitate a moment as to the 
part I should take, but immediately set myself on improving this circumstance and others, which then fortunately coincided, to the greatest possible advantage of these States, — the 
publication of the treaty, until that time ordered to be kept a profound secret, and the sending out the Toulon fleet, in which I embarked early in April. 
</p><p>
I submit to the consideration of Congress, whether from the 4th of March to the 30th, the day I left Paris, I could possibly have been better employed, and whether I could 
have justified myself, or been even excused by others, had I neglected these objects, and delayed to pay the most immediate attention to the order of Congress, for the mere 
purpose of collecting in and adjusting accounts from the 
different parts of France ; accounts which could not be collected and closed under several months, and in the settlement of which my colleagues were equally interested with myself. 
</p><p>
I say I submit this to the consideration of Congress, nor do I fear publicly to submit it to the world, or even to those enemies whom I am so unfortunate as to have in it. 
The voice of my friend and colleague, <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague'>Doctor Franklin</a>, with that of my other noble friends and patrons in France to me was, — "Lose not a moment on any object either 
public or private ; the fleet at Toulon will be ready by the time you arrive there ; by no means let it wait a moment for you ; you may sail early in April, and be in America in 
the course of the month of May ', you may finish the information you have to give Congress immediately, and return to France by the time the accounts you have been concerned in can be got ready for settlement ." It cannot be supposed, that I wanted to be urged to take the part I did ; on the contrary, I exerted myself to the utmost in my power 
to get away as early and as secretly as possible, being convinced that the plan was well laid, happy to find the ministry had come so readily into it, and sensible how much 
depended on despatch. Never was there a more glorious 
prospect before us than at that time, nor ever were my 
hopes and expectations raised higher on any occasion. 
</p><p>
Having been honored with the particular confidence, and I may say friendship, of the minister, and knowing that the 
relief of my country and the defeat of its enemies depended solely on our seasonable arrival, I suffered no private considerations to detain me a single moment. I was not 
insensible that I had enemies in America ; I knew well that I had them in France, in Mr William and Mr Arthur Lee, 
and I was well acquainted with their connexions in America ; but conscious of the part I had acted, and of the services I had rendered, and was then doing, for my country, 
which services were not in words, but in acts, the most honorable testimonials of which, given by the highest and first 
characters in Europe or America, I had in my hands, I had nothing to apprehend. Though permit me to assure you, that had I at the time foreseen all that has happened, and 
that even my life, as well as reputation, were to be sacrificed on my return, to the interested views of my enemies, I should not have hesitated a moment on taking the part I 
actually did take at the time. On my arrival early in July, I repaired immediately to Congress, and informed them I waited their orders. 
</p><p>
It was late in August before I had the honor of an audience. many circumstances, as well as direct information, convinced me, of what I had before suspected, that ill offices 
had been done me, and my conduct misrepresented. When I was first heard before Congress, I therefore requested, that if anything had been alleged against any part of my 
conduct, or character, as the public agent and commissioner of Congress, I might be made acquainted therewith, and have an opportunity for an explanation. I received no 
answer, and consequently had a right to conclude no charge had been made against me. I was told by many of the 
honorable members, that they knew of none, nor had they heard of any. Conversing with an honorable friend of mine, I mentioned to him my expectation of returning to 
France early in the fall, on which he told me I must not expect it, for that my enemies had determined to throw such obstacles and difficulties in my way, as most probably would 
detain me here much longer than I thought for. I asked him how it was possible, when the business I was ordered home upon was so very simple and so easily finished, and 
when the unclosed state in which I had been obliged to leave many public transactions in Europe, made my returning as early as possible of consequence to the public, as well as to 
myself, and especially when nothing had, nor, I presumed, could be, alleged against me. He answered, that it was the design of those, who wished to sacrifice me to the family 
interests and emoluments of my enemies, to wear me out by delays, and, without any direct charges, to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen by insinuations, hints, and 
innuendoes, that though I might with confidence rely on the justice of Congress, yet measures would be taken to delay
it on one pretence or other, in a way that would prove prejudicial if not ruinous to me. Though I could by no means 
bring myself to think my friend's suspicions well founded at the time, yet they made me more attentive to what was passing, and my observations served to confirm them. 
</p><p>
The many fruitless applications I made for near five months to obtain an audience of Congress, and to have the 
business I came out upon closed, are well known to Congress, and the inferences I drew from the silent neglects, which my requests met with, may be easily conceived. In 
this situation I determined to lay my case before my countrymen and fellow citizens, to whom I considered myself ultimately accountable, though immediately so to their 
representatives in Congress. In consequence of this determination,! published my address in the beginning of December. On the 5th, Congress resolved to hear me ; on the 
7th I attended, and was ordered to report in xcniing my agency of their affairs in Europe, as soon as may be, etc. 
In obedience to their commands, I delivered them a brief and faithful narrative of my transactions, from the time of my leaving America, and flattered myself, that, from the 
time which had elapsed from my recall, which was more than twelve months, and more than five from the time of my return and attendance, the fullest examination must 
have been made into every part of my conduct, and that I could not fail of obtaining an easy decision. Confident in 
the justice of Congress, I forbore to address the public further, whilst my cause was before Congress, and whilst I 
daily expected their determination. From these considerations, I silently submitted to the torrent of abuse, misrepresentation, and calumny, which almost daily poured 
forth against me in the public papers. 
</p><p>
I considered myself as the servant of Congress, and entitled to their protection ; to them I constantly appealed, not for favors, I asked none, but for justice. It is now five 
months since I laid my narrative before Congress, and on my being informed that a committee was appointed to 
examine and report on Foreign Affairs, and that my narrative was referred to them, I applied repeatedly to several 
of the honorable members, and requested that, if in the course of their examination they met with anything, in the letters and documents before them, respecting my conduct, 
which required explanation, they would call upon me and acquaint me therewith. I was not notified to attend them on the subject, and though I am informed their report has 
been for several weeks before Congress, I am unacquainted with its contents, as well as with the letters and documents on which it has been made. 
</p><p>
Since I had the honor of laying my narrative before Congress, I have repeatedly solicited for the decision of Congress, but am to this hour without the honor of any reply to 
the many letters I have written ; it would be tedious and perhaps unnecessary to repeat the substance of them ; it would take some time to refer to the dates only ; they are 
before Congress, and to them I appeal whether they speak the language of a man conscious of having defrauded and injured the public, or that of an innocent but greatly injured 
free citizen. I have had the honor of acting in the character of political as well as commercial agent for these States ; 
I have repeatedly observed that every thing relating to the former is already ascertained or ascertainable at this time, and I freely rest my merits in that department on facts, and 
on the testimony of those great personages, who best know 
what my conduct was, and who have generously, and without solicitation from me, publicly declared their approbation of it. With respect to my commercial, I have appealed 
and again appeal to that mode of trial, which will prove to a mathematical certainty whether I have embezzled or misapplied the public monies, or whether, for more than 
three years' faithful services, I have received anything more than my private expenses. I have for more than ten months past been constantly soliciting to have the accounts 
of the commissioners settled, on the issue of which I freely put my reputation, and every thing dear in life. My solicitations have been unsuccessful, whilst my enemies, taking 
the base and disingenuous advantage of the circumstances before mentioned of my leaving France, raise a cry against me and say — where are his accounts ? why did he not bring 
them out ? if they were not settled, why did he not stay and settle them ? I must confess, that when I reflect that these very men owe their present political, as well as personal, 
safety, to the measure I then look, I am at a loss which prevails most in my mind, indignation or contempt. 
</p><p>
I trust Congress will indulge me. and the rather as I hope not to be obliged to trouble them again soon, whilst I ask every unprejudiced and disinterested member of that 
honorable body, coolly to review the scenes I have passed through, and to place himself in the different situations I have been in at different periods, since my engaging in this 
great and important contest, and consider me, after having at the earliest period adopted and invariably pursued the most decisive and determined part, after having for more 
than four years devoted my whole time and abilities to the service of my country, more than three of which have been in the immediate service of Congress ; after bavins:, under 
every disadvantage and embarrassment, successfully solicited and procured most essential aid and supplies for these States ; after having been the principal actor in concluding 
an alliance every way honorable and advantageous to these States, and then returning to my native country with honorable testimonials of my character and conduct from His 
Most Christian Majesty and his ministers, as well as from my friend and colleague, and the French nation in general ; 
and with an armament, which promised, on its sailing, complete and decisive victory over the enemies of these States, 
and which, notwithstanding its misfortunes, relieved them (this capital in particular) from the deepest distress and the most imminent danger ; after this, to be obliged to 
waste ten months in fruitless attendance and solicitation for justice to my fortune and character, and at last worn out with the most mortifying delays and contemptuous neglect, 
driven unrewarded and unthanked to collect the little which remains of the scattered wrecks of my fortune, and to retire loaded with the most outrageous and unmerited 
reproaches into obscurity, poverty, and exile ; — I ask every member of that honorable body, even those the most unfavorably disposed towards me, to put themselves for a few 
moments in my case, which I have by no means colored beyond the real life, and then pass sentence. 
</p><p>
The loss of interest has little weight with me, nor loss of time, infinitely more precious, if by either, the honor, safety, and prosperity of these States is promoted. In the present 
case I am deprived even of this consolation, having seen, to my inexpressible grief, the essential interests of these States sacrificed by the very measures, which have occasioned 
the delay of justice to me. I still glory in the character of a free American citizen, and when I fear to speak in the style of one, I shall deservedly forfeit the most honorable of 
all titles. It was just and proper that my first applications should be made to the representatives of my fellow citizens ; I have made them in the most decent and urgent manner, 
and repeatedly. They have been treated with the most mortifying silent neglect, even whilst every thing dear in 
life to me, and more than life itself, my reputation, was suffering. I thank God I have sufficient fortitude to part with 
everything in life, and life itself, in the service of my country, without repining ; but no consideration whatever shall 
induce me silently to suffer my reputation and character to be abused and vilified, whilst I have the power either to 
act or speak. For ten months past I have presented myself and my case before Congress, such as could b} no 
means be considered in a neutral point of light, but decidedly meriting their approbation or censure. I have not 
been able to obtain either. Justice, therefore, to my countrymen and fellow citizens, to myself, and those great and 
generous personages who protected and patronized me, and the cause I was charged with abroad, requires of me that I justify myself before the world, by laying before 
them a faithful and exact account of all my public transactions from the first, and of the treatment I have met with. 
</p><p>
In doing this, (if laid under the necessity,) I shall on no occasion transgress against the strictest rules of truth and decency, nor be wanting in that respect, which I have ever 
paid, and shall ever pay to Congress, as the representative body of my fellow citizens. At the same time, I shall with proper firmness, and the dignity becoming a free but injured 
citizen, expose to public view those, whether in Congress or out, who, to promote partial, interested, and family 
views, have from the first systematically labored to prevent Congress from deciding on my conduct as the servant 
of the public, though the interest of these States called for their decision. I flatter myself I shall not be laid under the necessity of further application, but that Congress will 
relieve me from the unmerited distress I labor under by closing this long protracted affair, or at least by immediately taking such measures as will, without delay, do justice to 
my services. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the most respectful esteem 
</p><p>
and attachment, &:c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
As I have received no answer to my memorial of the 16th of August last, I conclude none will be given, and, 
consequently, that I am laid under the necessity of returning to Europe in the best manner I can, and at my own expense. 
</p><p>
I must confess, that when I reflect on the part I have acted, and the returns made me for my services, I have nothing but the consciousness of having done my duty to 
my country with zeal and integrity, and of having been successful in the important affairs I engaged in, to support me. Previous to my embarking, permit me to assure 
Congress, that my respect for them as the representative body of these States, is not lessened, nor my zeal for the service, prosperity, and happiness of my country abated, 
by the treatment I have met with. The expense of time and money, which I have suffered by my detention in this city, with the further expense I am now unavoidably forced 
to make, fall heavy on the small remains of a very moderate fortune ; but as I go to vindicate what is dearer to me than either life or fortune, my honor and character, as the 
faithful servant of these States, and confident that in doing this, I shall render essential services to my country, I cheerfully submit. 
</p><p>
On the 26th of August last, I received an order on the continental treasurer, signed by Joseph Nourse, for ten 
thousand five hundred dollars, said to be in full consideration of my time and expenses during my attendance on 
Congress, from the 4th of June, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, until the 6th day of Augst last. 
</p><p>
I mean not the least disrespect to that honorable body, nor do I feel the slightest emotions of resentment towards those of them, who opposed the grant even of that sum to 
me, but the same feelings, which prompt me to further sacrifices, forbid my acceptance of a sum so inadequate to my actual expenses, and confident that the day is not far 
distant in which I shall demonstrate, not only that the public monies and supplies from abroad have been at first obtained, principally by my agency, but that the disposition 
of them, so far as depended on me, was made with the utmost possible economy and perfect integrity. I refer to that time the discussion of what rec is due me for 
fourteen months' attendance in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, in obedience to the orders of Congress, and for the other services I have been so fortunate as to render the United States. I have 
so often troubled Congress with my letters, and been so particular in them respecting my situation and affairs, that I need only refer to them at this time, particularly to my 
letter of the 22d of May last, and to submit the whole to their wise and mature consideration. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the utmost respect to your private as well as public character, he.

When I did myself the honor of writing you on the 16th of November last, the order of Congress in my favor on the continental treasurer for ten thousand five hundred 
dollars being mislaid, was not enclosed. I now take the liberty to enclose it, and have the honor to be, with the most sincere respect and attachment, &u:.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
On my arriving in France, I applied to Mr Johnson to appoint a lime for examining my accounts and vouchers, 
which I told him would soon be ready. He informed me, that he had determined not to accept the appointment, and 
that he had informed Congress of his resolution sometime before. Though this was a severe disappointment to me, 
yet I flattered myself that Congress would not delay the naming some other to the office, and in this hope I came to 
Paris in August last, and entered on the adjustment of my accounts, which have been for many months ready for settlement, yet, to my extreme mortification, I cannot get them closed for want of an auditor, or person empowered by Congress to examine them. 
</p><p>
I pray Congress would candidly review the circumstances I have been under, from my leaving France in 
April, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, to this time. After having to that time faithfully and successfully served them, I was, in obedience 
to their orders, obliged to make a voyage to America, and to wait their pleasure in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> for more than a year, 
unable to obtain their decision on my conduct, though it was almost daily solicited by me ; the only objection made 
was, that my accounts remained unsettled ; as soon as Congress appointed an auditor to examine them, I set out on 
my voyage to Europe, regardless of danger or expense, fondly hoping that at last I should be able to close my 
accounts, and to receive the balance due to me, but what 
was infinitely more important, to vindicate my injured character. The expenses of my voyage were great, and during 
ten months' attendance here, they have been still greater, and though there is evidently a large balance in my favor, 
I have been refused money for my support. I have never 
asked of Congress anything but common justice, in the payment of my just demands, out of which, I have now been 
kept for three years. My necessities would long since have justified my seizing on the public property here to the 
amount of the money due to me, but I have been withheld from doing it on account of my regard for the credit of my 
country, and have rather chosen to be obliged to strangers for money for my support. And to what purpose is it for 
me to leave France, and return with my accounts and vouchers unaudited. It is equally useless to transmit 
them in that state. My enemies represented me as a defaulter, grown rich out of the public monies in my hands, 
and prejudiced the minds of Congress so strongly against me, that all my efforts in America to obtain even a hearing 
were vain and ineffectual. My present situation, as well as the state of my accounts, give the lie to every assertion 
or insinuation of the kind, yet T am still left to suffer under the calumny in America, and to be obliged to strangers for 
money for my support in Europe. I will not trust myself further on the subject, lest something escape me which may 
offend, without my intending it. 
</p><p>
I hope Congress will impartially review my case in every 
stage of it, and that they will not force me to appeal to the laws of a foreign nation, or to the tribunal of the public in 
Europe, for the recovery of my right, and for justice to my character, which the great and first law of nature will oblige 
me to do, unless immediately relieved by those who owe me, and more who owe to their own character, and to that 
of their country, the justice which I demand. I have the honor to be.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have written repeatedly to Congress, and to <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Morris</a>, and enclosed my accounts ; as I have not been honored 
with any answer, I fear either that my letters may have been intercepted, or that the multiplicity of business has prevented. 
</p><p>
Mr Barclay has been here some days ; he has looked into my accounts with the public, and I have given him a 
copy of them, which he has promised me to send by the most safe conveyance, and does me the favor of enclosing 
this to you, which is simply to request that you would take, or procure to be taken, such measures as will bring on a 
final and decisive settlement of my accounts. 
</p><p>
Mr Barclay tells me, that he has no orders on the subject, and that it lies in your department. I have, therefore, 
taken the liberty to address myself to you. 
</p><p>
Mr Barclay, after viewing my accounts, proposed that auditors, or arbitrators, should be named at Paris, to audit 
and settle the accounts. I have not the least objection to this, nor shall I have any against any person, or persons, 
named by Congress, provided they are such as have a competent knowledge of accounts, and are impartial. I am 
willing, either to nominate one part of them, or to leave the whole nomination to <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>, as Congress shall prefer, 
or to submit my accounts to the examination of Mr Barclay alone, provided that he be empowered to take the opinion 
of disinterested persons on the spot, as to any dubious or uncertain articles, and to make a final close of the affair. 
</p><p>
You will, by exerting your interest to bring this affair to a settlement, do, as I conceive, material service to the public, 
and certainly lay the utmost obligations on one, who has the honor to be, with great respect and esteem, etc.
