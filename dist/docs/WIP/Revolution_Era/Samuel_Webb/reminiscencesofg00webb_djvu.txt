REMINISCENCES 



GEN. SAMUEL B. WEBB. 



New York, 6 West 38th Street, 
July 4th, 1876. 

To my dear wife Laura Virgikia ; and to my dear children, Kob- 
ERT Stewart "Webb, Helen Matilda Morgan, Catharine 
Louisa Benton, Watson Webb, Alexander Stewart 
Webb, William Seward Webb, Henry Walter Webb, 
George Creighton Webb, Jacob Louis Webb and Fran- 
cis Egerton W ebb. 

I am now in my seventy-fifth year ; and after suffering from 
hereditary gout more than half a century, the wonder is, not that 
I am exceedingly feeble, but that I should still be here — with all 
my mental faculties unimpaired either by time or disease. I do 
not conceal from myself, however, that my departure is necessarily 
near at hand ; and I am admonished by the recent deaths in our 
family to be ready for the -summons. AVhen my mother died, in 
1805, we were seven in number ; and the first death among us, was 
in 1868 ; when my oldest sister, Maria, died in the seventy-sixth 
year of her age. Since then, my brothers Henry, Stephen and 
Walter, and my sister Jane, have all been taken away ; and it has 
occurred to me, that on this, the first Centennial Anniversary of 
the Independence of the United States, I cannot tender you a more 
appropriate ofEering, than a collection of some of the letters and 
correspondence of my father. Gen. Samuel B. AVebb, and of my 
step-grandfather, Silas Deane ; who, more than any one individual 
in the then American Colonies, fostered, consolidated and gave 
direction to that public sentiment, which ultimately led to the 
Declaration of Lidependcnce in 1776, and our final triumph as a 
free and Independent Nation. 

It was Silas Djanc, who, as Chairman of the Committee of 



Public Safety for tlie Colony of Connecticut, insisted upon and 
caused the assembling of the Congress of 1774 ; in which he exer- 
cised a controlling influence, and by which he was sent as sole 
Representative of the Colonies, to negotiate the recognition by 
France, of our separation from Great Britain, as early as March, 
1776 — four months previous to our Declaration of Independence. 
Franklin and Lee, were sent subsequently. 

In preparing for my family, this little Centennial offering, 
my first duty is, to recognize the fact, that, under Providence, we 
owe our independence as a People, and our existence as a Nation, 
to him who was — '•' first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts 
of his countrymen." The civilized world recognizes his great abil- 
ity, his exalted character, and the absolute purity of his private 
life ; but in nothing did he so greatly astonish mankind, as in the 
invariable justice which constituted the basis of all his public and 
private acts. The testimony, in this regard, is ample, and admits 
of no question ; and yet I desire to commence this little family 
sketch with an anecdote unknown, and of little interest to the pub- 
lic ; but which will constitute another contribution to that mighty 
monument, which a grateful people have in their hearts, conse- 
crated to his memory — based upon the public and private acts of 
a life dedicated to Justice and to his country. 

My father, bom on the 15th December, 1753, was only twenty- 
one when he was wounded in the head and won his first laurels at 
the Battle of Bunker Hill ; and only a little over twenty-two, when 
promoted from the staff of Gen. Putnam to be Aid-de-Camp to 
Gen. Washington, on the 21st April, 177G. He raised his regi- 
ment, the Third Connecticut, in 1777 ; and was taken prisoner as 
second in command to Gen. Parsons in his unfortunate expedition 
to Long Island, when crossing the Sound, on the morning of the 
10th December, 1777. 

Washington, with whom my father was a favorite, was in the 
habit of so,ying, that his Aid-de-Camp, Col. Gary, was " the hand- 
somest, and his Aid-de-Camp and private secretary. Col. Webb, was 
the most accomplished gentleman in the army."' My father 
ha^-ing inherited a fortune, was furloughed by his chief, in 1777, 
after the successes in New Jersey, in order that he might raise 
the Third Connecticut Regiment,— which he did chiefly with his 
own means. That is, he made all the necessarv advances, and 



took his chance of repayment from his country. His regiment 
was clothed in Britisli nnifoi'ms. cajitnrcd from tlic enemy at sea; 
and in all the operations on the Hudson, iu.tlw Summer and Au- 
tumn of 1777 and '78, it was known as the " Decoy Regiment;" 
and it was to this "Decoy Regiment" that Burgoyne's spy sur- 
rendered himself, at Fishkill, and declared his mission — having 
swallowed the musket ball, or what appeared such, whicli con- 
tained the despatch from Burgoyne to Sir Henry Clinton, an- 
nouncing his intended march Soutliward from Ticondcroga. 

Ill correcting Gen. James Talnuxdge's history of this aifair, 
my friend, the venerable (!eii. Ynu Cortlandt. in 1,S45, ad(lress(Ml 
me the following letter: 

Peekskill, Fei)\ '^stli, 184:). 
.1. W . Webb, Esq., 

Dear Colonel : — ****** "Wi^.n I see you. I will relate to 
you the particulars of (iov. (ieorge Clinton detecting the s/ii/ fi'om 
Sir Henry CJlinton to Gen. Burgoyne in 1777, at New Wiiulsor; of 
which .las. Talmadge, made sucli a great dis[)lay in [iresi'iitiug the 
silver bullet to the American Institute. 

Your father was an etlicient agent in detecting the i^/ii/. tiie 
particulars of whicli I have very frequeiiliy heard Gov. (_!liiiloii 
repeat. However, let this rest till I see you, wlu'ii I will relate to 
\oii t he particulars. 

Yours, with much resiiect, 

Pierre Van Cortl.\ndt. 



The following is a cojiy of the original order, which enabled 
my father to procure the captured Brit ish uniforms for his newly ^^ y&gt; /Jir "/\A ■ 
raised regiment— Jjthe Thii'tl Connect icnil Haiid which cmuscmI it toll . V j " 
Known as the •' Decoy Regiment : 
'/ Hi-;AU(iiAirrEKs, .June ;i8, i;77. 

u^V^ Col. Webb has his Excellency's, General Washington's Orders, 

to appropiiate so much of the Scarlet Cloathiiig, taken from the 
Hneniy at Sea, as will be siilticient to cloath one Regimenl. The 
said ('loathing, to be set ap.art for his Regt. 

Tho.s. Mifflen, Q. M. (;. 



The close and \vv\ fi-ieinlly persiuial relal ions which alway- 
existed between Gen. Washington and in\ father, fiHUii the line. 



he became a member of his staff in April, 1776— a mere boy— un- 
til the Geiicrars death, is demonstrated bj' the fact, that every 
unofficial letter he -ever wrote his young friend, was invariably 
signed- •' Your obedient and offectionate servant." This, from 
one who so rarely was demonstrative, speaks volumes. 

At the time of ray father's capture, he was not quite twenty- 
four years of age, although he had won his spurs at Bunker Hill; 
and as A. D. C. of the Commander-in-Chief, had participated in the 
battles of Long Island. Harlem, White Plains, and all the affairs of 
the army in New Jersey; finally crossing the Delaware to Trenton 
in the same boat with his Chief, and winning fresh laurels in that 
very gallant affair. He it was, who bore the order to General Sul- 
livan's troops, to commence the assault; and when told by Sullivan, 
that their muskets were wet and could not be used, added — " in 
that case you will use your bayonets! " 

After the battle of Trenton, Gen. Washington begged him 
to go to Connecticut and superintend the recruiting of his regi- 
ment. But he said, "No; not until you get safely into Winter 
quarters, which will be only after much hard fighting. I would 
sooner give up my regiment than abandon you now." 

You will find allusion to this, in the letters congratulating biiii 
upon the laurels won at Trenton. 

It was in the December following, he was taken prisoner; and 
during the two and a half years preceding, he had been wounded 
at Bunker Hill and at White Plains; had been the Aid of Gen. Put- 
man and then of Gen. Washington; and had been actively engaged 
with his Chief, in every affair of the army; and was known to be a 
favorite at headquarters. Not yet twent)'-four, it is not a niatt&lt;'r 
of surpri.se, tiiat he ventured to address to his old Chief the follow- 
ing letter.

wh(. had. vtTV naturally, i)resumed upon their personal rehitions, 
to olitaiii all I'arly release from captivity. 



Gen. Washington to Col. Webb. 

Valley Forge, Jan'y 8th, 1778. 

Sue — I was this Evening, favored with your Letter 'of the 
tiiltli Ulto. I had heard before, of your unfortunate exjiedition &amp; 
captivity; and not without concern. 

It would give me pleasure to render you any service^in my 
power; but it is impossible for me to comply with you request, 
without violating the ]n-inci]iles of Justice and incurring a charge 
of partiality. 

You are sensible, that we have several officers now in captivity, 
with the Enemy, of your Eank and of Lieut. Col. Campbell's 
Rank, who have been in this unhappy situation much longer than 
you: some taken when General Thompson was defeated at the Three 
Rivers early in 1775 — others at Long Island, in August following 
— others at Fort Washington; and a further number at the Battle 
of German Town. These gentlemen, would sui-ely, exclaim loudly 
against my conduct, and with reason, were any dixfinclion ^to ]<v made="" by="" my="" concurrence="" authority,="" to="" their="" prejudice.="" so="" far="" exchanges="" depended="" me,="" or="" as="" may="" rest="" with="" me.="" they="" have="" been,="" and="" ever="" will="" be="" coiulucted="" on="" one="" princii)le;="" u=""> 
wit, to release those first, who were first captured, as far as circum- 
stances of Rank would apply. There is no other rule by which 
equal and imjiartial justice can he done. 

I know there have. been some Exchanges contrary to this rule; 
but they were not made with my privity, consent or approbation. 
In a word, you may rest assured, whenever circumstances put it in 
my power to effect your Exchange, &amp; that of all the officers and 
privates, under the Restrictions I have mentioned, there shall not 
be a moment's delay on my partj but on other terms or in a dif- 
ferent order, you will find on reflection, / can never do it. Sup- 
pose yourself, for instance, an officer taken at any of the aljove 
periods, you would consider it an injury — a wrong — an act of high 
injustice done you, if (uie captured the 10th of December last, of 
your Rank was exchanged before you. 

Per''".iis on your return, you may liavc interest enough with 
your acquaintances, to obtain your release on parole; but you can- 



^

uot do this ou the principle of haviug an officer sent in on the like 
indulgence; the objections to an Enlargement on parole otit of dve 
courae, in sncli case, being the same as to an Exchange. 

I am. Dear Sir, 

Your most obedient Servant, 
G". Washixgton. 



How characteristic was this of the man. He was not aluivc 
reasoning with his boy-friend; bnt he tauglit him to know at once, 
that his case, in consequence of their past relations, must l)e held 
up to the army as an example of his justice, uninHueiu'cd by ;uiy 
personal considerations. 

As Commissioner for a general exchange of prisoners, my father 
spent most of the period for which he was a prisoner, at Wethers- 
field and Philadelphia and at the headquarters of our army; and 
when finally, his turn for exchange arrived, his old commander and 
friend, took an early opportunity to show, that his stern justice to 
his former favorite, was not dictated by any want of friendship or 
confidence. Accordingly, when LaFayette resigned the command 
of the Light Infantry of the army, Washington's jtet corps, he, 
Washington, aj)poiuted my father to be LaFayette's successor. 



Silas Deane, who was Chairman of the Committee of Safety 
for the Colony of Connecticut. aj&gt;pointed my father his private 
secretary; and it was in tliat capacity, that he accompanied liis 
step-father to Phihidelphia, at the (q)ening of the C'ongi-ess of 
1T74-5, where he first made tlie acquaintance of AVashington. 
But the aspect of public affairs, grew more lowering; the jiroba- 
bility of a rupture, daily increased; and my father, early in 1775, 
i-esigned his secretaryship and tlie charms of Pliila(leli)hia society, 
and returned to Wethersfield, to be nearer, what j&gt;romi.sed to be- 
come the scene of strife. 

When the news of the battle of Lexington reached Wethers- 
ticld. my father at once volunteered as a private in Capt. Chester's 
Light Infantry Company, and marched for Boston. Four days 
thereafter, wliile on the march, he was elected the First Lieuten- 
ant; and Capt. Chester being absent, he took command of the 
company. Shortly after its arrival at Cambridge, Capt. Chester 



10 

joined liis company, and commanded it at the battle of Bunker 
Hill, on the 17th June, 1775. It was their good fortune to occupy 
the angle in the "Stone Pence," where the hardest fighting oc- 
curred; and both Capt. Chester and Lieut. Webb, were thanked in 
general orders, for their gallantry. Gen. Putnam .sliortly after, 
appointed my father his Aid-de-Camj); and on the 21st Ajiril. 
ITTC. at New York. Gen. Washington apjiointed him his Aid-de- 
Canip, with the rank of Lieutenant-Ciolonel. Burr succeeded him 
as Aid-de-Camp to Gen. Putnam. 



A letter from my father to Silas Deaue, giving an account 
of the battle of Bunker Hill, was deposited by the parties having 
charge of Mr. Deane's papers, in the Hartford Historical Society; 
and strange to say, it is said to lie the only account of the battle 
of Bunker Hill, written by one who participated in it, known to 
.])e in existence. A much fuller account of the battle, was written 
by my father to his brother, Jose])h Webb; but cannot be found.

of tlie American army. No one licrc, is so well calculated for that 
important office. His extensive connections, enable him to pro- 
cure every necessary with the greatest imaginary dispatch. I 
fancy he is recommended by our General; wliieli, with your and 
his other friends influence, I doubt not, will procure him the fa- 
tiguing Berth. I have received many friendly services from him. 
I wish to add many particulars, but the Express waits. 

Capt. Chester is in a fair way to be appointed a Brigade 
Major. We have burnt the Regular Guard Houses in Eoxbury. 
Little skirmishes happen almost every day. The King's troops, 
come off second best. 

Major Milllin being very observing with his glass, has been 
complimented with half a dozen four and six pounders from the 
Ships and Batteries in Boston; but he is a small mark, and came 
off clear. 

I beg you to write me particularly, whenever you have leisure. _ 
Bo assured I am, Dear Sir, with esteem, 

Affectionately yours, 

Sam'l B. Webb.

Cambridge, July 11, 1775. It,2,S^ 

iff^^^EXR Sir: — Since the close of my other letter, I find the Ex- 
'^css is likely to be detained half an hour. I had entirely forgotten 
to mention to you the conduct of General Spencer; which I doubt 
not, you'll licar from several quarters. After intelligence of Put- 
nam's being appointed Major-General, (which, by the by, gave 
universal satisfaction), Spencer appeared much chagrined and dis- 
appointed. He began to speak very freely; and finally, ])crsuaded 
the officers, to remonstrate to the Assembly of Connecticut; and he 
setoff immediately for home, without leave or license from Gen. 
Washington, which displeased him much. 

I cannot imagine our Assembly will bo guilty of so great an 
imprudence as to take any notice of the matter. I am sorry to 
say, your friend Col. -Parsons was forward in this matter. I have 
since been to Roxbury, and find the officers, many of them, hearti- 
ly sick of what they have done, in particular, Maj. Meiggs, — who 
says he was forced to sign what the others did — to keep ])eace; and 



14 

says he had rather serve under Putnam than Spencer. You'll find 
Generals Washington and Lee, are vastly more fond, and think 
higher of Putnam, than any man in the army; and he truly is the 
Hero of the day. They have given him the command of Prospect 
Hill. 

I find the intention of Spencer, was to get our Assembly to 
remonstrate to the Continental Congress, and beg a re-appoint- 
ment; but little did he think that this could not be done without 
cashiering Putnam, as he is in possession of his commission. Bet- 
ter is it for us to lose four Spencers than half a Putnam. I think 
it my duty to write thus freely to you, though perhaps, it would 
not be prudent to have it seen in print. 

Opposite to Putnam, is placed Gen. Howe, on Bunker's Hill. 
Gen. Burgoyne commands on the Neck, at Koxbury. He has 
wrote a long letter to Gen. Lee, in which he proposes a meeting; 
whether this will be complied with or not, I cannot say. A certain 
something runs through the whole of his letter, which shews they 
are sick at the stomach. He says: " If the right of taxation is all 
we are contending for, he is empowered to say. Great Britain will 
give that up." Why did not they say that six months ago ? They 
must now remember, that we have an undoubted right to ask for 
the expense we have incurred in raising an army and for the loss of 
the beautiful town of Charlestown, which is now a heap of rubbish. 
We doubt not Burgoyne writes thus, so as hereafter to say, that he 
made us generous offers, with a view to compromise matters. He 
is as cunning and subtle as the Devil himself ; and writes as if he 
was on the right side of the question, like a man of abilities ; but 
his wickedness is to be seen in every sentence of bis letter. 

We have had one of our sentries desert over to the enemy; and 
a Frenchman, who came here in the character of a gentleman, 
was detected in stealing. The next day he deserted to the enemy; 
but he's of no consequence, being simple, a foolish fellow. 

We heartily wish for the Riflemen to arrive; and instead of 
1,000, we wish it was 3,000. We really want them; and we are 
in hopes you'll make an addition. 

I am in the utmost haste. Yours most affect'ly, 

Sam'l B. Webb. 
Mr, «. Deane.

Extract of a Letter written by Jos. Webb from Weathersfield, in 
Connecticut, to a Gentloiiiaii in New York, dated April 23, 
1775. American Archives. 

"The late frequent marchings and counter-marchings into 
the country, were calculated to conceal the most cruel and in- 
human design; and imagining they had laid suspicion asleep, they 
pitched upon Tuesday night for their execution. A hint being 
had, two expresses were sent to alarm the Congress. One of them 
had the good fortune to arrive; the other (Mr. Kevere) is missing, 
— supposed to be waylaid and slain. 

In the night of Tuesday, the Company of Grenadiers and 
Light-Infantry from every Ecgiment, were .transported to Char- 
leston in long-boats ; and at daybreak, began their march for 
Lexington; where a number of the inhabitants were assembled 
peaceably, without arms, to consult their safety. The Commander 
called them rebels, and bade them disperse. On their refusal, he 
fired, and killed and wounded nine. They then proceeded towards 
Concord, marking their way with cruelties and barbarity never 
equalled by the Savages of America. In one house a woman and 
seven children were slaughtered, (perhaiss on their return.) At 
Concord they seized two jDieces of cannon, and destroyed two 
others, with all the flour, &amp;c. in store, but the people secured 
their magazine of powder, &amp;c. 

By this time, about four hundred (no accounts make them 
more than five hundred) of our men assembled, and placed them- 
selves so advantageously, without being perceived, that wlien the 
enemy were on the return, they received the full fire of our men. 
A lieavy engagement ensued, — the enemy retreating, and our men 
pressing on them with constant reinforcements. 

At Lexington, they retook their two pieces of cannon, seized 
the enemy's wagons and baggage, and made about twenty pris- 
oners, continuing to press the Regulars close to Charlestown, 
where they were on the point of giving up; (one account says this 
Brigade was almost all cut off,) but a reinforcement, under the 
command of Lord Percy, having been detached that morning from 
Boston, joined the first detachment in the retreat, and retired 
with it to Bunker's Hill; where they intrenched, and night parted 
them. Our number increased, and next morning would have sur- 



16 

rounded the hill, had it not been for the situation near the water; 
where, on one side, they were exposed to the fire from a Man-of- 
War. We lost thirty men in the action. The lowest account of 
the enemy's loss is one hundred and fifty. 

Lord Percy, General Haldimaud, and many other officers, are 
said to be among the slain. A gentleman of veracity assured me, 
that he numbered, within half a mile from the place where the 
fight began, one hundred and fifty. The Post confirms the same 
account. We are all in motion here, and cquiped from the Town. 
Yesterday, one hundred J'oung men, cheerfully offered their ser- 
vice; with twenty days' provisions, and sixty-four rounds, per man. 
They are all well armed, and in high sjjirits. My hrother has gone 
wilh them; and others, of the first properly. Our neighbouring 
Towns are all arming and moving. Men of the first character and 
property, shoulder their arms and march off for the field of action. 
We shall, by night, have several thousands from this Colony on 
their march. The eyes of America are on New- York ; the Ministry 
have certainly been promised by some of your leading men, that 
your Province woiild desert us; but you will be able to form a 
better judgment when you see how this intelligence is relished. 

Take care of yourselves ; we have more than men enough to 
block up the enemy at Boston, and if we are like to fall by treach- 
ery, by Heaven we will not fall unrevenged on the traitors; and if 
balls or swords will reach them, they shall fall with us. It is no 
time now to dally, or be merely neutral ; he that is not for us is 
against^ us, and ought to feel the first of our resentment. You 
must now declare, most exi^licitly, one way or the other, that we 
may know whether we are to go to Boston, or New- York. If you 
desert, our men will as cheerfully attack New-York as Boston, for 
we can but perish; and that wc are determined upon, or be free. 

I -have nothing to add, but am, your friend and countrynum, 
&amp;c. Joseph Webb. 

P. S. — Colonel Murray's son, one of the Tories, undertook to 
guide the Eegulars in their march to Concord, and on their retreat 
was taken jjrisoner ; but attempting to escape from our people, 
they shot him, — a death too honourable for such a villian ! 

They have made another of them prisoner, but I do not recol- 
lect his name; none of ours were taken. 



17 

Will Colonel Grant believe now. that New-England men dare 
look Regulars in the face ? Eighteen hundred of their best men 
retreating with loss, before one-third of their number, seems almost 
incredible; and I think must be called an omen for good. In every 
struggle Heaven has, as yet, given us strength equal to the days; 
its hand is not shortened, nor its arm weakened. 

We are now called upon to show the world "that whom we 
call fathers did beget us," and that we desire to enjoy the blessings 
they purchased for us with their lives and fortunes. We fix on our 
Standards and Drums, the Colony Arms, with the motto, "qui 
trai&gt;duUt sustinc/,'' round it in letters of gold; which we construe 
thus : " God. who transplanted us hither, will su])port lis."

From recollections of the Connecticut Historical Society. 

A letter from Capt. John Chester, written from the Camp at vptyii^ 
Cambridge, July 22d, gives a general account of the battle, and a ' 
more particular one of " his own concern in it, with that of his 
company." This letter was first printed (from the original in the 
editor's possession) by Mr. Frothingham, in the Appendix to his 
"History of the Siege of Boston," pp. 389-391. 

In the Courant of July 31st, 1775, "A friend to Truth" calls 
attention to the distinguished services of " Major John Chester of 
Wethersfield, now Captain of a Company in General Spencer's 
Regiment, and Lieut. Samuel B. Webb, who marched up to the 
lines with their men. and re-enforced the troops; [and who] by 
their undaunfed behavior, and timely and vigorotis assistance, it is 
universally agreed, are justly entitled to the grateful acknowledg- 
ments of their Country." 

Fromfr^collections of the Connecticut Historical Society. 

An "Extract of a letter from Wethersfield, to a gentleman in 
Philadelphia, dated June 22, 1775," giving some account of the 
battle, " gathered by letters from the camp," is printed in Am. 
Archives, 4th s. ii. lOGO. The writer was, probably, Joseph Webb, 
brother of Samuel B. He says : " Captain Chester writes me, 
that before it was possible for him to get there, the battle had 



18 

begun in earnest," &amp;c. " Chester and my brother were both in the 
engagement;" "My brother says 'we were obliged to retreat to 
Prospect Hill.'" &amp;c.

^ n ,,, T Cambridge, June 22, 1775. 

Last Friday night a detachment from onr Army began an in- 
trenchment on an eminence below Bunker Hill, about a mile to 
the northward of the centre of the Town of Charlestown. 

The enemy appeared to be much alarmed on Saturday morn- 
ing, when they discovered our operations; and immediately began 
a heavy cannonading from a battery on Copp's Hill, Boston, and 
from the ships in the harbour. 

Our people, with little loss, continued to carry on the works 
till one o'clock, P. M., on Saturday; when they discovered a large 
body of the enemy crossing Charles Kiver from Boston. 

They landed on a point of land about a mile eastward of our 
intrenchment, and immediately disposed their Army for an attack ; 
previous to which they set fire to the Town of Charlestown. . 

It is supposed the enemy intended to attack us under cover of 
the smoke from the burning houses, the wind favouring them in 
such a design; while on the other side, their Army was extended 
northward towards Mistick Eivcr, with an apparent design of sur- 
rounding our men within tlie works, and of cutting off any assist- 
ance intended for their relief. 

They were, however, in some measure, counteracted in this 
design, and drew their Army into close order. 

As the enemy approached, our men vv'ere not only exposed to 
the attack of a very numerous musketry, but to the heavy fire of 
the battery on Copp's Hill, four or five men-of-war, several armed 
boats or floating batteries in Mistick River, and a number of field- 
pieces. Notwithstanding tliis, our Troops within the intrench- 
ment, and at a breastwork without, sustained the enemy's attacks 
with real bravery and resolution, killed and wounded great nvimbers, 
and repulsed them several times; and after bearing for about two 



19 

hours as severe and heavy a fire as perhaps ever was known, and 
many having fired away all their ammunition, they were over- 
powered by numbers and obliged to leave the intrenchment, — re- 
treating about sunset, to a small distance over Charlestown Neck. 

Our loss, from the best information we can obtain, does not 
exceed fifty killed and about twenty or thirty taken prisoners. 

The Town of Charlestown, supposed to contain about three 
hundred dwelling-houses, a great number of which were large and 
elegant, besides one hundred and fifty or two hundred other build- 
ings, is almost all laid in ashes. 

The enemy yet remain in possession of Charlestown, and have 
erected works for their defence on Bunker Hill. 

It is said they have brought over some of their Light-horse 
from Boston. Our troops continue in high spirits. They are for- 
tifying a very high hill about a mile and a half from this Town, 
and within cannon-shot of the enemy on Bunker Hill. 




From Joseph Webb to Silas Deane. 22 Jt^wu- ill-S- 

Before this, you must know, I conclude, that there has been a /Xi/r^ CHa-Q^^ 
)attlc, in which fell the honourable, the noble Doctor Warren. /^ * -rr- y^^^ 

For fear you may not have the particulars, I will endeavoiir in 
lart to relate to you how the atlair was, according to the best ac- 
counts I can gather by letters from Col. Chester and brother Sam. 

Last Friday afternoon orders were issued for about eighteen 
hundred of the Provincial Troops, and two hundred of the Con- 
necticut, to parade themselves at six o'clock, with one day's 
provision, equipped with packs, blankets, &amp;c. 

Their orders were given at nine o'clock, and they marched 
with tlieir teams, trenching tools, &amp;c., on Bunker's Hill, to heave 
up an intrenchment, which you are sensible is near the water, 
ships, &amp;c. They worked most surprisingly that night, and were 
discovered at sunrise by a sailor from the mast-head. 

The British Army commenced a heavy fire from Copp's Hill, 
near Cutter's Church, in Boston, and from all the ships which 
could be brought to play; which continued till near night. About 
one o'clock, A. M., the Americans at Caml)ridge, heard that the 
Regulars were landing from their floating batteries. The alarm 



•20 

was sounded, and they were ordered down to the breastwork at 
Charlestown ; and Captain Chester writes me, that before it was 
possible for him to get there, the battle had begun in earnest, and 
cannon and musket balls were plenty aljout their ears. 

Chester and my brother, were both in the engagement. 

They re^enforced our men who had left the breastwork in fine 
order, though they passed through the cannonading of the ships, 
bombs, chain-shot, ring-shot, &amp;c. ; but then the enemy's superior 
number of artillery and men (for they were three to one,) forced our 
men to retreat, after a warm engagement of an hour and a half. 

Thank Heaven, but few of our men fell, considering tlie ad- 
vantages they had over us, — our men being much fatigued with 
working at the intrenchmeuts. and I believe not in the best prepa- 
ration to meet an enemy. 

The British Troops, to their eternal disgrace, shame, and bar- 
barity, set Charlestown on fire with torches. 

My brother Sam says, "we were obliged to retreat to Pr9spect 
Hill, (alias Winter Hill,) where we made a stand, and declared we 
would all die, before we would retreat any farther; but the British 
Troops did not think fit to come out from under the protection of 
their shipping. The loss of Americans is supposed to be, of 
wounded, missing, and slain, about one hundred and twenty. 

"A large genteel, well dressed gentleman, who first mounted 
our breastwork, was overset by one of our impudent Americans; 
who took so good aim as to prevent his ever mounting another, as 
he tumbled him into the intrenchment just as he cried, ' the day 
is our own.' "We greatly rejoice to hear of the coming of the 
good, the lirave, and great George Washington; and shall receive 
him with onen arms." 



The following letter, written to Silas Deane, at the age of 
&lt; . twentii, exhibits a preeociousness whicli appears to have been char- 

A 1^ laft* acteristic of the men who achieved our independence. 

L^ J y^*^ Samuel B. Webb to Silas Deane. 

laOn/^^Vx.. J-tCok ■■^Ocl Wetheesfield, Monday Evening, Octo'r 10, 1774. 

^ c Dear Sir:— By my Brother's letter from you, per Jemmy, 

' ^ this evening, I notice you mention my not writing you, since my 



21 

leaving Philadelphiii; l)ut 1 luive frequently heard that a man with- 
out any business, is the most busy man in the world. This I give 
as one reason why I liave not written you since my return. But 
the priiiei])al reason is truly this, — that my brother, as I suppose, 
had given you all such intelligence as would be necessary, amusing, 
or worth paying postage for. But as it seems you desire I should 
write, I risk the chance of its being acceptable or amusing, and 
wish I may find anything to say that may meet with the wished-for 
approbation, — and I take this early opportunity, for fear I may 
not have leisure again between this and next post. 

My continual uneasiness and anxiety on account of my Sisters, 
who are now in Boston, has determined me to pay them a visit, 
and if some unforeseen incident does not prevent, I intend setting 
off the last of this week. I shall take Newport, Providence, &amp;c., 
in my way; and will, if anything new or interesting occurs, write 
you from each place; but more particularly, from the present seat 
of noise and confusion — say Boston; the true situation of it and 
of the fortifications which are now erecting at the only entrance of 
that large capital. My brother seems more at ease about our 
sisters, than you, (by your letter) or I do. May all his conjectures 
be right. That "they are as safe there as here," is my most fer- 
vent wish; but much I fear. On the first hostility, such as blood 
shed by the Troops in Boston, this Colony will most undoubtedly, 
be immediately under arms and march for Boston. The Light 
Infantry at Middletown, to which I for two years belonged, have 
now a very fine stand of arms which I purchased for them in New 
York, on my return home from Philadelphia. They have given me 
an invitation to make one of their number, should any emergency 
demand their appearance in the field; which, with my whole heart 
I shall readily accept, if occasion offers. But Heaven forbid we 
may ever arrive at such an unhappy Crisis ! But all have drawn 
their arms; and myself among the rest. 

On my return, I personally waited on Mr. Davenport at- 
Stamford, and upon the Selectmen of every Town which I passed 
through, in that county; and have the pleasure to inform you, that 
the Spirit of Liberty, which has so long been buried in silence, 
seems now to rear its head. Fairfield has had a meeting, and en- 
tered into good and spirited resolves; and they are now collecting 
grain for Boston. Greenwich. I am informed, and Stratford, are 



doing the same; — tlic latter I am uncertaiu of. Mobs, which I 
fancy you judge ruinous to all good government, will be opposed 
by every true Sou of Liberty in this Colony. Other methods may 
be adopted more effectual to quiet our very f etc remaining enemies. 
A reason, and I think a very good one, is given, that all such riots 
should be stop'd in their first growth, viz., "A day may come, and 
in all probability soon will, unless a redress of our grievances can 
be obtained, that we may be as destitute of all Law and Civil 
Government, as Massachusetts now is." Then, if mobs are allowed 
to take hold of persons and private property, dissensions will 
follow; and we soon should be, instead of a United, a broken Body. 
These are the principles our warmest friends adopt; and as I before 
hinted, I think them sound. 

Our Assembly met on Thursday of this week. Many plans, 
&amp;c., &amp;c., are formed for our Militia; the best I have seen is by Mr. 
Hosmer, with, I suppose, the help of some military genius of that 
town; and he strongly wish'd you to meet him there, to push for- 
ward the plan. Some few remonstrances I hear, are to be thrown 
in; but I hope not to be noticed. Permit me. Dear Sir, to ask 
whether a letter from Col. Dyer, Mr. Sherman and yourself, on 
this subject, to some of your friends, Members of the Assembly, 
or the Council, &amp;c., (as there is not a possibility of your being 
jiresent), would not be of service ? I am not the only one that 
thinks it would. But as I am a young, and consequently, an inex- 
perienced politician, I shall for the present, drop the subject, and 
leave it to better judges and more experienced men; tho' young as 
I am, [twenty,] I shall ever maintain my principles; which I 
think, arc justly fixed. 

Letters, which you mention to have sent by a private hand to 
New York, for the Thursday's Post, are not yet come to hand; I 

hope not stopp'd by , but I think not improbable, as all 

parties are on the lookout. The safest conveyance seems to be by 
post. Should anything new come to hand, I shall mention it. 

My most respectful compliments await on the gentlemen of 
the family, — Mr. House, Mrs. Trist, and Miss Levy. To Mr. Fur- 
guson I shall write — " The most Important Man," — if time before 
I go. 

I am, with most dutiful respects. Dear Sir, Your very affec- 
tionate frier^^ and most humble servt., Sam'l B. Webb. 



Wednesday, 12th. liy Mr. Bclding, wlio goes on to tlio 
Assembly this morning, I forward this to New Haven. Joe would 
write you; but yesterday and the day before were field days. Two 
com])anies of Foot and the Trooi)are in the field, which my Brother 
was obliged to attend; his respects to you; says he shall write you 
next post. I would, as I have promised, write Mr. Furgrison, but 
time will not allow me at present. 

Am, as above, yours affectionately, 

Sam'l B. AVebb.

Dear Sam'l: — The Bearer Mi: Chas. Craig, is a Lieut, in a 
Comp'y of Biflemen, &amp; he being a Stranger in the Army, I recom- 
mend to you to Notice, and introduce to the Gentlemen of your 
Corps ; which I am sure you will take the greatejl^jf pleasure in ^/ 
doing, as he comes to share with you the common dangei^of your S/ 
glorious exertions in our Common Cause; and indeed the Cause of 

Mankind in general I have received no letter in answer to any of 

mine, tho' I have wrote by every opportunity since the departure 
of Gen'l Washington, as well as previous thereto. This makes me 
conclude your Letters must have miscarried; for I never can be-

was extensively engaged in commerce, in Boston ; and who, after the affair at Lexington, , 

was not permitted to leave the city. He died iti Boston while occupied by the British ; and 
his widow subeecjuently married Joseph Barrel], a distingaished merchant of Boston, of the 
firm of Barren &amp; Gray. It was one of their vessels, commanded by Capt. Gray, which dis- 
covered the mouth of the Columbia River; and upon that discovery, was based our claim to 
Oregon and the Northwest ; which claim was confirmed by Treaty with Spain, and oar title 
recognized to latitude 40' north.

lieve, for your, as well as my sake, that you are unmindful of Me. 
Let your next, relieve me from the least doubt on this head. 

I have nothing new worth sending so far. I sent you a Book; 
hope you received it. Write me particularly by the next post, 
which will encourage me to continue more at large a Course of 
Letters consequent on what I entered upon in my first, &amp; afterward 
hinted at by Gen'l Gates. I am wisliing you success equal to the 
justice, &amp; extent of the Cause. 
My Dear Sam'l, 

Yours affectionately, S. Deane.

Mt Dear: — This will be handed you by his Excellency, Gen- 
eral Washington, in company witli General Lee, and retinue. 
Should they lodge a night in Wethersfield, you will accommodate 
their horses, servants, &amp;c., in the best manner at the tavern, and 
their retinue will likely go on to Hartford. 

We this moment, received advice of a Ijattle at Bunker's Hill; 
but the account is very confused. It is said to have happened on 
Saturday last, and the news arrived liere this morning. 

I have wrote you so lately and so particularly, that I have 
nothing in the small way to add; and of business, I dare not think 
other than is before me. May God preserve us ! 

I am, my Dear, Yours, &amp;c., 
S. Deane. 

Mr. Mifflin, of whom I have often spoke, is a Major in the 
militia here; and is Aid-de-Camp, as I hear, to the General; is my 
particular friend, and I am happy in the thought, that you will be 
able to return some of the many civilities I have received from him 
in this city. If ever there was true spirit and patriotism in man, 
he possesses them. 

Inclosed is more of North Carolina composition. I gave your 
compliments to them, and told them of your opinion of fJaesar, at 
which we laughed very heartily.

Headquaetees, Cambeidge, September 10, 1776. 

D'e Webb: — The Hurry of Business &amp; an irksome Complaint, 
have prevented my writing to you before. How do you do? Do 
you get better? Do you want anything from here, that I can pro- 
cure you ? Answer me these Questions as soon as you can. You 
know I take a sincere interest in your welfare, &amp; should be happy 
to promote it. Letters are come to-day from Mr. Deane. He was 
safe at Bordeaux the 1st July; much caressed by the People there, 
especially of Eank. We do not know his success in Politicks, as 
his letters are to Members of Congress; &amp; the Gen'l does not choose 
to open them. 

You gave Mr. Tilghman and me, some expectations you would 
lend him your Marc. He is so obliging as to stay here and do 
duty, but has no horse, nor can we provide him with one. If 
you can spare her conveniently, it would be very convenient to us. 
We are at present very bare in point of assistance. The fierce sons 
of Carolina, who were so appreliensive there would be an action 
before they came, have taken wing. 

Gen. Sullivan has returned; the Congress have appointed Dr. 
Franklin, Mr. Adams &amp; Mr. Rutledge, to meet Lord Howe in a 
friendly conference at Amboy or Staten Island, as his Lordshij) 
chooses. I fear it will come to nothing. Our Militia are all gone 
except a very few. One Regiment returns 24. I hope this will 
open the eyes of every man upon such miserable &amp; futile depend- 
ence. 

God bless you and give you better health. 

Yoiirs Aff'y, 

J. Reed.

Chas. Whiting's letter to Lieut. Sam'l B. Webb. 

Middletown, 20th June, 1775. 
My Deae Sam : — I most heartily congratulate you Sammy, on 
your safe return from the Field of Battle. Am highly rejoic'd to 
hear that you behav'd worthy yourself, and prov'd that your cour- 
age was genuine. I want much to see you and tell you a thousand 
things &amp; ask 2,000 questions. Write me, as soon as leisure per- 
mits, everything concerning the engagement, for as yet, amidst 
the endless variety of accounts, I don't know what to depend on 



27 

as truth. I much fear that the melancholy tidings of the death 
of the amiable and worthy Dr. "Warren, will prove true. How 
many and what men have you lost? Yesterday I rec'd a line from 

; he remembers you; the doct'r is going; must not add; my 

hearty compliments to Capt. Chester, and squeeze his hand for 
me. Adieu! My Dearest Sam'l.

Comfort Sage's letter to Lieut. Sam'l B. Webb. mlU^ tn^ UK t^, 
MiDDLETOWN, 14th July, 1775. 

Dear Sammy: 

Sir: — It gives me the greatest pleasure &amp; satisfaction, to hear 
of your good conduct and Behaviour at all times; more especially, 
in the late action at Charlestown, where you played the man in 
such a manner, that your friends and acquaintances frequently 
spak of it with pride and pleasure. I pray God Almighty if you 
should be called to action, that He would protect and preserve you 
in Battle &amp; Crown you with Success. I should be glad to hear 
from you at all opportunities. 

Little or no news here. Last Monday, the King Fisher went 
up the Sound after a vessel from Sea, and sent her Barge with 16 
men on shore at Branford. A number of people collected and cut 
her off, &amp; took the Barge with the people. The Bearer, Capt. 
Warner from Newport, has taken shelter with his family, together 
with three other familes from there, in that place. He is a Gen- 
tleman of fortune &amp; Character; and I should esteem it a particu- 
lar favour if you'll notice him accoi'dingly. He is accompanied by 
my son Eben'r, who has been ill about six weeks. He made a pretty 
good voyage. On their return I expect to set out for the Camp. 
I am with esteem, 

Your real friend &amp; ob't s'v't, 
CoMFOET Sage. 

My best respects to all friends and acquaintances.

Col, Chester to Maj. Sam'l B. Webb. 

RoxBURY Camp, August 11th, 1775. 

Dear Sammy: — I perceive by General Orders, that the General 
proposes honouring those gentlemen who behaved well in the ac- 
tion on Bunker Hill. For my part, as I am determined not to tapry 
longer than the time I first thought of, and am not anxious for pro- 
motion; &amp; if I was, I imagine there is no vacancy nor like to be 
for me. But two things have determined me to write to you &amp; 
request your advice on this subject. And first — By the way I am 
no preacher &amp; never intend to be one — I say then firstly: Will 
not a censuring world say, in case we make no representation of 
our behaviour on Bunker Hill after so fair an opportunity given 
us by the General, that we fear to have our conduct looked into, 
&amp; that we cannot make good our pretensions, &amp; the story we have 
told of our conduct? 

Again: Would it not be doing injustice to our subalterns &amp; 
under officers, not to represent their behaviour and good conduct? 
For whatever you or I might think of the matter, tl(ey all are de- 
sirous of it &amp; hope for promotion or notice in some way or other, 
in consequence of what the General has published. I have con- 
versed with them and know their opinions in the matter. 

Now if you think best, after what I have said, to say anything 
to ye General about the matter, I should be much obliged to you 
to do it. I am free to ask it of you as you are on the list, &amp; as 
you are perfectly well acquainted with the whole matter &amp; can do 
it to as good advantage as any man. 



29 

A certain big bellied General, will make tlie most of his great 
doing, I very well know. I wish his conduct could be fully known. 

The Blins have had 10 lashes each, this morning, for deser- 
tion. 

With Regard to rank, &amp;c., — had I best try to make any advan- 
tage of my commission at home as Major, or justipe, or having 
been sundry times, a member of assembly, &amp;c., &amp;c. Write me &amp; 
tell me how you do &amp; how you go on at Cambridge, &amp; if you have 
a convenient apjj'y, come and bring it yourself. Thereby you'll 
greatly gratify your friend &amp; most obliged humble serv't, 

John Chester. 



Jos. Webb's letter after receiving intelligence of his brother's gal- 
lant conduct in the l)attle of Trenton. 
I J^ ^^ Wethersfield, January 4, 1777. /-j ^ ^ //: 

)A^t&gt;^,^^^^ My Deak Brother:— Yours of the 37th Ulto. was handed &gt;^'^^**- 
''^ i^'-^ me on Thursday Morn'g. I opened it at Breakfast, and never was ^5, 5Z^ ,' 
^^ more pleased in my life. It was agreeable and unexpected news. 

Joy overcame us so much that scarcely one of us could finish our 
breakfast. Col. Knox's Lady was in Comp'y. She has been at 
our house these several days on her way to Boston. Heavens be 
praised for this lucky, happy and Important turn in our favour. 
Nothing in life, could happen at a more critical juncture — in every 
place and almost every face, you may see almost a surprising alter- 
ation — tho' no one was willing to own any doubts or fears before. 
I must own New England has fewer Tories than I think Jer- 
sey or Pennsylvania has — yet we have some. Good God! has his 
Excellency met with any Misfortune? My Blood chills at the very 
Reflection. Heaven reward and preserve him. I believe Jack will 
accept under Shelden; he seems pleased with it, and I think Jack 
will make a very genteel, good officer. Blagden is Major, field- 
ing has accepted a Lieutenancy. I think this bids fair to be a very 
genteel corps. Accept my sincere thanks for your attention in 
writing me; I acknowledge myself under the Greatest Obligation 
for 'em. Your Chest &amp; Baggage are at Jere Wadsworth's — the 
needful shall be done. The Bearer is waiting, cannot add. 

Except that I am affectionately yours, 
January 4th, 1777. Jos. Webb. 

I shall write you by Next Post — but I have not been so good

in writing, on acc't of the uncertainty of the times, which you 
must excuse. Its a remarkable Healthy time, and our connections 
are well. 




Col. John Chester's letter to Col .Samuel B. Webb, Aid-de-Camp 

to General Washington, Morristown. 

Wetheesfield, January 17, 1777. 

My Deae FEiEifD: — We all congratulate you on the place of 
honour you have lately shared in the victories over our common 
enemy, and jiray for a continuation of successes, till they may be 
obliged to quit the Land or Kneel to Greet George the American. 
You cannot conceive the joy and raptures the peo2:)le were univer- 
sally in, as we passed the road. 'Tis good to be the messenger of 
glad tidings. We were the first that brought the news to Peek- 
skill, of ye Trenton afEair. Gen'l Heath thought it a matter well 
worth forwarding by Express to Boston, which he did. We have 
such vague, uncertain accounts of these matters in general, that I 
cannot but think that it would richly pay the expense of forward- 
ing accounts of this kind by Express. They make an amazing 
alteration in the faces of men and things. 

Our assembly are determined, at all events, to fill up their 8 
Battalions, if possible. They have granted a bounty of £10 Ster- 
ling in addition to the encouragement given by Congress; which, 
if money will induce men to engage, one would think was suffi- 
cient. The good news we have lately heard is worth £100,000 to 
Connecticut only in raising. 

Keport says that the Gen'l has desired you to ride into Con- 
necticut to stimulate your Brethren in the good old cause; &amp; that 
you declined leaving him at this critical season. How is it? 

I wish you to transmit us the earliest accounts of any actions 
that may happen; we shall, in all cases, be able to improve them 
to good advantage. So many lies circulate that we are loath to 
believe the truth unless it comes well authenticated, from under 
hand and seal from headquarters. 

Thos. Wooster has lately been with me, on his road to Bos- 
ton, and begs me to write you about a Grenadier Eegiment he 
heard you talk of; &amp; which, he thinks, will be raised and hopes not 
to be forgot. 



31 

I iiiu told that the assembly (which, by the way, have now been 
sitting more than 4 weeks at Middletown) have at last formed the 
Militia into Brigades and appointed their General officers. Great 
doings in Connecticut. Col. Juliez Huntington is appointed ' ^f-'^ 
Major-General; Col. Dyer Saltinstal, Erastus Waleott, Oliver Wal- 
cott, Gen'l Wadsworth &amp; Col. Sullivan are appointed Brigadiers. 
Old Gen'l Wooster takes command of them all as Major-General. 
I wish &amp; hope, that it may answer some good purposes; tho' I much 
despair of the Militia's doing any great things, after my last Sum- 
mer's experiences. Your humbk^ servant has tho honour to be 
appointed Lieutenant-Colonel under Col. Belding, Col. Talcott 
having resigned. But sooner will he go in the Ranks than submit 
to be Commanded by those who he has threatened to Court Martial, 
&amp; call'd them all the lifeless, stupid, dull souls, that could be 
thought of. 

The inhuman treatment our prisoners met with while in New 
York, is beyond all description. Humanity cannot but drop a tear 
at sight of the poor, miserable, starved objects. They are mere 
skeletons, unable to creep or speak in many instances. One vessel 
lost 27 in her passage from York to Milford, &amp; 7 died the night 
they were put ashore; &amp; they are dying all along the roads. Most 
who have got home in the neigliboring towns, are taken with the 
small pox, which undoubtedly was given them by design — all this 
does not seem to discourage the few surviving ones. They pray 
that God would only give them health and strength again, &amp; they 
are determined to have sweet revenge, &amp; all swear they will never 
be taken again. Is this a proof of the much boasted humanity 
of Britons? Is this a generous return for the kind and hospitable 
treatment their prisoners have rec'd at our hands? Do they think 
by these mean, low arts to dishearten our countrymen? Depend 
on it, they have universally a contrary elfect; for men wlio deter- 
mined never to fight are bent upon it now. Write us the news of 
the day. 

Mrs. Chester &amp; family, join me in compliments to you. 
Your sincere friend &amp; humble serv't, 

John Chester. 



32 

On the death of my father, December 13, 1807, there were 
seven of us orphans, — only one of them younger than myself"; and 
the executors, Gen. Jacob Rutsen Van Rensselaer and Prosper M. 
Hosmer, considered that they discharged their whole duty as ex- 
ecutors, by permitting the old housekeeper — who had been in the 
family since 1790, and who died in it in 1830 — to continue the es- 
tablishment; they simply suppljang the means. She was one of 
the best creatures that ever lived; of German descent, but could 
neither read nor write. She was devoted to us children, and we 
to her; and to this day, I am not conscious of ever hearing any 
other names applied to her, except "Mammy Betsey." Her one 
idea of duty, was to render us happy; and, of course, the only 
mode to accomplish this, according to her judgment, was to let us 
do as we pleased. 

I have no doubt but my father, at his death, left to us a 
more accurate and detailed statement of the incidents and events 
of the Revolution, than had been prepared by any other individ- 
ual. From the day he marched from Wethersfield to take part in 
the battle of Bunker Hill, and for years previous, he never failed, 
except from illness, to write up his journal of the day. He rarely 
destroyed a paper; and the accumulated records, embracing the en- 
tire period from 1774 to 1784, filled two monstrous chests, not less 
than five feet long and of proportionate width; and every scrap of 
paper, in this great mass of manuscript correspondence, journals 
and accounts, was as accurately and carefully filed, as are the ar- 
chives of any court of record; and all these treasures, were left to 
be treated as best suited the whims of children. The letters of 
Washington, Jay, Hamilton, and other notables, were scattered 
broad-cast among our school-fellows. What was particularly at- 
tractive, were the books of blotting paper we prepared for them. 
And how, think you, it was done? My father, who was exceed- 
ingly neat and precise (as well as expensive in his habits), had 
blank books, of uniform size, prepared for his journal, with cov- 
ers of soft leather; and between the sheets of writing paper, was 
bound up a sheet of blotting paper. These journals were careful- 
ly labelled A, B, C, extending through the entire alphabet; and 
then a new series commenced, marked AA, BB, CC, and so on 
down to PP. And those invaluable records of our great war of in- 
dependence, in relation to which he, from his position, knew prob- 



33 

ably as much as any individual, save the Commander-in-Chief; — we 
children, left to ourselves by executors who, however high their 
social position, were no better than vandals, — deliberately, but in 
profound ignorance, destroyed! We tore out of those Journals 
and destroyed all the 'written manuscript contained in them; and 
presented the pretty little books of blotting j)aper to our school- 
fellows. One only, of the entire series, remains. 

But independent of this regular series of Journals, embracing 
all passing events, it appears that my father was accustomed to keep 
a kind of blotter, composed of unbound sheets of foolscap, carefully 
sewed together; on one page of which, when Aid-de-Camp to Gen- 
eral Washington, he carefully drafted the orders of the day, to be 
issued; while on the opposite page, he wrote, from day to day, 
what he termed " Kemarks and occurrences, &amp;c." 

In 1846, the Philadelphia Gazette, contained an editorial, stat- 
ing that a gentleman had recently come in possession of part of a 
Journal, &amp;c., purporting to have been kept by Samuel B. Webb, 
in 177G; which could not fail to be of interest to his heirs, if any 
existed; and inviting such, if any, to address William B. Reed on 
the subject. 

I immediately addressed a note to my friend, Colonel Reed, 
apprising him that I was the son of General Samuel B. Webb, 
claiming the waif; and I desire here to say of my old friend— who 
was the grandson of Colonel Joseph Reed, an Aid-de-Camp of 
Washington at the same time as my father, and subsequently, ad- 
jutant general of the army— that, although he recently died in this 
city under a cloud, and had fallen from the high position he once 
occupied, he was a warm-hearted, cultivated gentleman; and in 
social life, one of the most agreeable and fascinating men of his 
time. His public career terminated with his mission to China; 
and, familiar as I have been with all our public men from IS'^O to 
1875, I know of but few who, socially, were Colonel Reed's equals. 

My letter promptly brought the Journal, with the following 

note : 

Philadelphia, Sept. 24, 1846. 

My Dear Webb:— I intended to see you before you left town 
and say what I now must write. Your father's Journal; whicii, 
of its kind, is a perfect historical gem, ought to belong to you, and 
you ought to take good care of it. 



34 

By tlie express of to-morrow, you will receive it. As I have 
some doubt of my riglit to part with it. I wish you to consider it 
in your hands subject to restoration, and say so in a note to me. 
There is no probability of any demand being made. 

Among my papers I find an incidental notice of your father 
in a skirmish on December 4, 1777, near Chestnut Hill. In haste, 
truly yours, William B. Reed. 

I published in the Courier and Enquirer several extracts from 
this journal; and subsequently, loaned it to Mr. Lossing, the his- 
torian. When he returned it to me, it was accompanied by the 

following letter: 

PouGHKEEPSiE, Jan. C, 1854. 
General Webb, 

Dear Sir : — I hasten to comply with the recjuest contained in 
your note of yesterday. My apology for keeping the journal of 
your honored father, so long, is that I was waiting to find time to 
make an abstract of its most important particulars for preserva- 
tion. Each day brought its pressing duties, and I -deferred it. 
On the receipt of your note, I sat down to the task; and now have 
the pleasure to acknowledge the gratification which has been af- 
forded me. 

You are doubtless aware, that all the remainder of the edition 
of my "Field Book," was consumed with Harper's establishment. 

I am now preparing it for a new and improved edition; and 
am happy to have it in my power to insert in a note, the fact, that 
your father; as Aid to the Commander-in-Chief, wrote the order 
respecting the reading of the Declaration of IndeiJendence to the 
army, the destruction of the statue of George III. and other nota- 
ble events during the Summer of 1776. I also observe that your 
father and Colonel Joseph Reed, were the persons who met a flag 
from General Howe; and when the bearer presented them with 
letters directed to " George Washington, Esq." instead of " Gen- 
eral Washington," patriotically refused to receive them. All honor 
to the noble hearts of men so zealous of even the smallest cour- 
tesies due the beloved commander of the "rebel army!" 

Their names and deeds, should not perish with the grass that 
was flowering when they were achieved. Very truly yours, 

Benson J. Lossing, 
No. 66 South avenue. 
To General James Watson Webb, New York.

I also loaned the journal to Mr. Bancroft and Washington Ir- 
ving; both of whom made use of it. Every reader of American 
history, is familiar with the fact, that Lord Howe superciliously 
addressed an official letter " To George Washington, Esq.," which 
was refused; but by whom and under what circumstances it was 
refused, was not satisfactorily known until Colonel Keed discov- 
ered in the interior of Pennsylvania, this " perfect historical gem," 
as he denominates it. 

Very properly, General Washington's Aides, Colonel Joseph 
Keed and Colonel Samuel B. Webb, both young men, and the lat- 
ter only twenty-two, prevented the offensive missive ever reaching 
the hands of Washington ; who cordially approved their conduct. 
They subsequently, again refused to receive a letter similarly ad- 
dressed, some days later; and then. Lord Howe asked " that his 
Adjuant-Gcneral might be admitted to an interview with His Ex- 
cellency General Washington." 

You will perceive that on the 21st of June, 1776, my father 
was appointed Aid-de-Camp to Washington from the staff of Gen- 
eral Putnam; and that on the 22d, Aaron Burr was appointed 
Aid-de-Camp to General Putnam "in place of Major Webb, pro- 
moted, — " my father having been made Aid-de-Camp to Putnam 
shortly after the battle of Bunker Hill.

June 21, 1776. — Agreeable to this day's orders, Colojwl Gary 
and myself, removed to headc|_uarters as Aid-de-Cam]i to His Ex- 
cellency General Washin^on. - 

Some days past, the General received information that a most 
horrid plot was on foot by the vile torifs olthis place and thc^d- 
jacent towns and villages. Having taken the necessary prccTui- 
tions, ^t two o'clock in the morning a number of officers »b4- 
o-uards, went to different places iUMl took up many of tlieir princi- 
fg^f\ among whom, was David Matthews, Esq?^ Mayor of the city;

was to lie put in execution as" soon as the enemj^fleet appeared, 
if no proper time "offered before; but thank'God, they are discov- 
ered, and many of them in close custody; where, I hope, they will 
receive the punishment due suchlnf anions wretches. ' 

June 23. — By express from Canada we have the disagreeable 
mtelligence, that on the morning of the^ iiist.. General Thomp- 
son, at the head of 1,500 men, attack/^d the eiiemy at Trois-Eivers, 
/AiiA. VliM^- supposing t J i wM to be abaat 500. But, unlifckily for us, the even- 
•^t/j- ing before, the enemy received reinforcements to the number of 

about 4,000 men, with General Burgoyne at their head; by which 
means General Thompson was defeated and obliged to retreat. 
On his retreat he, with five officers, fell into the hands of the 
Canadian militia, and were carried jn'isoners to General Burgoyne's 
camji. ThTs unfortunate affair, we rear, will oblige our little army 
(f&gt; leave Canada. When the express came away. General Suirfian, 
with the remaining part of our army, abattt. 3,500 men, was forti- 
fying b im s etf at the Sorrell. We" wish to hear of their safety. 

June 23. — The detachment under Colonoi Jacobs 
fatigue near King's Br-idgc. About one o'clock, this 

detachment of about 250, under Majors and ]5^ 

inarched to rout a number of torics in the swamps on L' 
■^ iru and to pick up such men as afe notoriousTy mimical to the jiber- 

ties of America. Success attend them. 

June 24. — The guard, at the City Hall, has in charge those 
traitors to their county .who were concerned in the late horrible 
l51ot. 

' June 28. — This t i-^e u i ^ ig we hear t4^&lt;»t our cruisers on the back

fleet of more tliifc JrOffjquare rigs;vd vessels, had arrived and an- 
chored in the Hook. — Tliis is the fleet "which we forced to evacuate- 
^ Boston; and whioi i went to Halifax last March, where they have — / 
been waiting for reinforcements, and have now arrived here with a 
view of put/ing their cui'sed plans into execution. But, briwover;' *T&lt;-^t^t&lt;-«—

jn-esses b«»A«~this day gone to Connecticut, the Jerseys, &amp;c., to 
hurry on the militia. 

July 1^ — Fy express from Long Island, we are informed, that 
the whole fleet weigh'd anchor and came from Saudy Hook^over un- -^y,,^ /^ SA.iru 
der the Long Island sEore, and anchored abwtt half a mile »ffr 

which leads us to think they mean a descent upon the Island this ^

some of them must have been killed or wounded — ^he sloop «afi 
quite disabled. j. 
lY, y^ ,\ July 7.— By several descrti^es from the fleet and army on 
Staten Island, we learn, t^ut the number of the enemy's abea^ 
10,000; that they hourly look for Lord Howe fronrEngland w/th 
a fleet, on board of which is 15,&amp;a0 or 30,000 men; that they pro- 
A-C^ pose only to rest on the defensive'till the arrival of this fleet, when 
they mean to open a warm and bloody campaign, and expect to 
2^1^ carry all before them.^ We trust fhey wifTbe disappointed. 
J '7? A. Jul.y 9.'-^ Agreeable to this day's orders, the Declaration of

the Liberty now to account, through you, to the family for her 
not returning to Claverack with ^Ir.s. Ludlow, as was intended, 



64 

and wliy (her Indisposition), was used to Mrs. Liidlow [wife of W. 
B.] as a reason for her delay. 

Shortly after Kitty's arrival with me in tliis city, she attracted 
the notice of Gen'l Webb in a more than nsual degree ; and as the 
General was always considered rather as one of our family, he had 
frequent daily, nay, hourly ojiportunities of conversing with &amp; ad- 
miring the native Simplicity of our little friend without even a sus- 
picion of a serious Intention — 

A few days, however, before Mrs. Ludlow came to town, I be- 
gan to suspect that the General's pointed attentions, and Solicitiide 
to please, might have a dangerous effect on the susceptible Heart of 
a Girl unhacknied in the ways of Love, and in the end terminate 
in a final separation, to the Injury of her health and destruction of 
her hap)piness — 

I communicated my Ideas on this suliject to Polly, who, I 
foxmd, had viewed matters in the same light ; and as we conceived 
ourselves the Guardians of her Hapiiincss, determined on her re- 
turning with the first favorable opportunity ; particularly as we 
could not with propriety exclude the General from the house, or 
deny Kitty the Pleasure which she appeared to take in his Com- 
pany— ■ 

When Mrs. Ludlow came to town, the opportiinity offered 
which we looked for, and Arrangements were accordingly made for 
an Embarkation, which Polly easily discovered to bo a very un- 
pleasant Circumstance to both parties. Intimately acquainted 
with General Webb's Character as a Man of Honor, and solicitous 
for the Happiness of our young friend, I, for the first time, as- 
sumed the Father, and took upon me to converse seriously with Kitty 
on the subject ; in which interview, after setting the matter in a clear 
point of view, I proposed that she should push the General to an 
explanation the evening previous to her intended departure ; and 
if she should, from such explanation, have reason to believe that 
he was serious in his Intentions, that I should insist on her 
spending the winter with me, and trust to female Invention for a 
plausible excuse — but that if she found him evasive in his Con- 
duct, or undecided in his Intentions, that then she should by all 
means fly from his presence as from a Pestilence— and seek the 
Restoration of her II(&gt;alth and Happiness in the arms of her Pa- 
rents. 



65 

For the particular event of this Interview, I must refer yon 
to her letter ; all that I can add is, that they seemed hotter pleased 
with each other than before, and, of course, I laid an Embargo on 
her, at least for a few months longer — 

In this Business I intend you to bo jiorsuaded, and to assure 
the family, that nothing but a sincere Regard to the Happiness of 
Kitty, has been my motive, and that I look forward to an event 
which will I am pursuaded, meet the approbation of her friends, 
when they consider that it will, in all human probability, com- 
pleat the Happiness of one in wh )So prosperity we aro all inter- 
ested — 

With our best Cjmiiliments to your Wife and the good fam- 
ily, I am, Dear Doctor, 

Your most oo'd't, 

Doctor Vroojian. AV. Popham. 



Having alluded to Mrs. Boekman, who retained all her facul- 
ties until her death, I add the following anecdote, which she re- 
lated to me in 1845 : 

My uncle, John Webb, a Captain of (savalry, was, like myl 
father, a frequont visitor of the Bookman Manor House, during ^ ^i^*"^^ 
the cam))aigii on the Hudson ; and having slept, there, on one oc- 
casion, Mrs. Beokman says, "on leaving in the morning, he said to 
me, 'Heave my valise, which contains all the money I have and my 
uniform. I'll send for it ; but do not deliver it without a written 
order from me.' On the following morning, I heard John Smith, 
a neighbor, whom I always sxispccted, ask my husband for Major 
Jack's valise ; and he told me to get it from the Major's bedroom. 
I called out, enquiring of Smith, if he had a written order from 
Major Jack, for the valise ? He answered, ' No ; but you cannot 
doubt that he sent me.' I told him he was a good-for-nothing fel- 
low ; and bade him go about his business. 

" It subseqently turned out, that Smith, at that moment, had 
charge of Major Andre, and wanted Major Jack's uniform, in or- 
der that he might pass oiir lines as an American officer. Andre 
was arrested on the following morniug,( and Smith fled to New J 
York." '■ 

The two old cluiirs I have, known as the Boekman Chairs, 
I purchased at the sale of Mrs. Boekman's furniture, 1847, because 



66 

she informed me that Washington, accompanied by his favorite 
Aid, my father, frequently passed up and down the country, sleep- 
ing at the Manor House ; and that, on such occasions, camp beds 
were made for them, with jjiHows, in the two arm chairs referred 
to. They originally belonged to the Van Horn family ; and are 
more than two hundred years old. The old mahogany chairs of 
my father, were made for him, on his marriage to Miss Banker, in 
1780 ; and the coTcrings underneath the plush seats, were worked 
by her before her marriage. 



PART III, 



New York, 14 West 38th Street, 
November -itb, 1881. 

Thus much of these memoranda was completed in 1876, when 
laboring under almost continuous attacks of my old hereditary 
enemy, the gout (of which my grandfather died,) and I was com- 
pelled to suspend my labors. In the Spring of 1878, I was at- 
tacked by gout and bronchitis, accompanied by a local inflammation, 
which appeared to render my death inevitable ; and the newspapers 
published daily bulletins, setting forth the extremity of my position, 
and also published what might be termed- obituaries in advance of 
my dissolution, but a kind Providence, permitted my recovery ; 
and now, enfeebled in body, but I believe not in mind, I proceed 
to finish my intended tribute to the memoi^ of my father. 

I am greatly embarrassed in proceeding, by the fact, that al- 
though my material for a biographical notice of my father, is not 
sufficient for writing a history of his life, it is so valuable and in- 
teresting, that each of my children is desirous of particijiating in 
it on my departure. As this is impossible, and would, if distrib- 
uted among the ten, render almost valueless the letters and docu- 
ments, which, while of little interest to the public, are to us of 
value, I have been induced to enlarge the contemplated publica- 
tion. I have, therefore, introduced into this offering, notes, docu- 
ments, &amp;c., &amp;c., of no earthly interest to the public. But the 
public, it miist be borne in mind, have nothing to do with this 
purely family affair.

"Franklin, a little intoxicated by the nnusual honors heaped 
upon him. did not press forward the negotiations as rapidly as 
Silas Deane, his neglected colleague in the Embassy, thought nec- 
essary. Worn out by the excuses and delays of M. de Sartieres, 
Deane wrote word to that Minister, that unless the treaty between 
France and North America was signed within twenty-four lioui's, 
he would commence negotiations for reconciling England with her 
Colonies. 'All is lost I' exclaimed Franklin, when Deane told 



73 

hiiii of the decisive stt'p he hud taken; • you have mortally offend- 
ed France and ruined America.' ' Tran([uilizc yourself until 
you hear the answer,' was the di])Iomatist's cold reply. 'The an- 
swer,' cried tlie ]ihiloso|)her, 'will be an order for sending us to 
theBastilel' 'We shall see that,' said his unmoved colleague. 

"After the lapse of a few hours, one of M. de Sartieres' Secre- 
taries waited on the Ambassadors and said, ' Gentlemen, you ai"e 
requested to hold yourselves in readiness for an interview; at mid- 
night you will be sent for.' 'At midnight!' exclaimed Frank- 
lin, when the Secretary left the room, 'then my prediction is 
verified. Mr. Deane, you liave undone us.' 

"At the hour ajjpointed, a carriage came for the Envoys and 
conveyed tliem witli great and mysterious secrecy, to the country 
residence of M. de Sartieres, about four or five leagues from Paris. 
They were introduced to the Minister; and the declaration, so im- 
periously demanded by Mr. Deane, was signed on the instant, to 
the great surprise and satisfaction of Franklin."'

Sannu'l Athinis to Silas Deane. 

BoaxoN, May 19, 1774. 

Sir: — The Committee of ('orres])ondence for the Town of 
Boston, have had before them a Letter signed by yourself, in Be- 
half of the Committee of the llon'le House of Representatives for 
the Colony of Connecticut; and I am desired, by our Committee, 
to return them their hearty /hanks for the Readiness they discover 
to support tliis Town, now called forth to stand in the Gap, and 
suffer the vengeful stroke of the Arm of Tyranny! God forbid^ 
tliey should succunilj. I trust in Hini j ^e shall never be so ser- 
vile, as to submit to the ignominious Terms of the cruel Edict. 
Aided by our Sister Colonies, we shall be able to acquit ourselves 
under so severe a kvialwith dignity. But that aid must be speedy; 
otherwise we shall not be aSle to keep up the spirits of the more 
irresolute among us, before whom the crafty adversaries are al- 
ready holding up the grim Picture of Want and jVIisery. 

It is feared by the Committee, that a conference of the Com- 
mittee) of Corres])ondence, from all the Colonics, cannot be liu<l speedily="" answer="" ])resent="" emergency.="" if="" shall="" think="" i)roper,="" use*="" inlluence="" merchants="" several="" seaport="" towns="" connecticut,="" t^-^="" ¥="" q="" l="" v^="" 74="" prevtiil="" witli="" those="" each="" tor="" themselves,="" withhohl="" their="" trade="" britain="" ireland,="" every="" west="" indies,="" commence="" certain="" time="" (sa_y="" 14th="" june="" next),="" will="" sacrifice="" indeed,="" but="" not="" greater="" americans="" have="" given="" world="" expect="" them,="" when="" called="" offer="" it="" tlie="" preservation="" pu))liek="" liberty.="" one="" year="" virtuous="" forbearance,="" would="" succeed="" wishes.="" 4="" w="" sentiment="" suffering="" humane.="" obliging="" letter="" has="" preclud-="" ed="" necessity="" me,="" urge="" utmost="" exertions,="" coii-="" necticutt="" may,="" important="" juncture,="" act="" her="" part="" support="" common="" cause,="" th?="" attack="" is="" made="" immedi-="" ately="" boston.="" being="" present="" pressed="" time,="" cannot="" write="" largely="" feel="" disj)osed="" do.="" must,="" therefore,="" conclude="" assuring="" you,="" am="" very="" great="" regard="" hon="" le="" committee,="" sir,="" your="" sincere="" &="" fellow="" countryman,="" de.^ne.="" samuel="" adams.="" ^,="" ^3="" silas="" deane="" his="" wife.="" (affl^w\="" \..="" tcijhy.="" scc="" (from="" york.)="" dear:="" left="" bridge,*="" closed="" my="" last,="" after="" dinner,="" baiting="" by="" town="" six.="" wm.="" hubbard="" doe="" turner,="" overtook="" bound="" for="" philadel])]iia;="" so="" now="" make="" considerable="" string="" road.="" instantly="" alighting="" bayard="" came="" up.="" allowing="" shift="" linen="" (apprehensive="" like="" shifted="" mine="" bridge,="" before="" dinner),="" he="" forced="" us="" directly="" excliange,="" where="" boston="" delegates,!="" two="" from="" s.="" carolina,="" all="" gentlemen="" consid-="" erable="" note="" city,="" mercantile="" way,="" wliere="" tliey="" tlined,j="" were="" passing="" glass.="" ajjjjeared="" s="" bridge.="" t="" thomab="" cushieg,="" samael="" john="" adams,="" robert="" trent="" paine,="" who="" arrived="" new="" york,="" 80.="" they="" flrst="" hull="" tavern="" sign="" bunch="" grapes,="" afterwards="" private="" lodgings="" mr.="" tohius="" stountenburg="" s,="" king="" streef.="" —="" j.="" adams^="" diary;="" \york&="" ii,="" 345.="" x="" dined="" (thursday,="" aug.="" s5th),="" in="" exchange="" chamber,="" invitation="" committee="" ol="" correspondence,="" with="" more="" than="" filty="" gentlemen,="" at="" most="" splendid="" dinner="" i="" ever="" saw="" ;="" profusion="" rich="" dishes,="" t&c,="" &c.="" •="" ♦="" *="" highest="" possible="" spirits,="" on="" introduftion.="" hut="" though="" read="" that="" presence="" a="" friend="" enligliteneth="" countenance,="" yet="" brilliancy="" this="" circle="" might="" ijy="" us,="" without="" any="" violence="" vanity,="" be="" as="" well="" attributed="" something="" else.="" we="" went="" round="" of="" introduction="" congratulation,="" and="" then="" took="" our="" seats.="" glass="" had="" circulated="" just="" h)ng="" enough="" to="" raise="" the="" si="">irits of every one just to that nice ])oint which is above disguise

brother Delegates, and mixed among the gentlemen of the City. 
Here was McEvers, Alsop, Bache, Sherbrooke, Sharp, &amp;c, &amp;c. 1 
soon found that parties ran excessively high in the City. Here 
were none of the Broomes, Sears, McDougallsor any of them; yet I 
found many favorable to the cause we were up(ni, and willing to go 
almost any length, while others were in reality against doing any- 
thing at all. I found they were fond of jiaying great court to Con-

that these intriguing gentry wanted to interfere with him in. I 
have scarce any patience. Heaven! blast, I implore thee, every 
such low, narrow, selfish, envious manoi-uvre in the land, nor let one 
such succeed far enough to stain the fair page of American patriotic 
politics ! 

General Washington writes, that Spencer left his post without 
so much as waiting on him, or sending him a single word of his in- 
tentions. You can be at no loss to infer what opinion is formed of 
him from this conduct, in doors and out. Suffice it to say, the 
voice here is, that he acted a part inconsistent with the chai'acter 
either of a soldier, a patriot, or even of a common gentleman. To 
desert his post in an hour of danger, — to sacrifice his Country, 
which he certainly did as far as was in his power, — and to turn his 
back sullenly on his General, a General, too, of such exalted worth 
and character, — will, I can assure you, unless he take the most 
speedy and effectual measures to atone, draw upon him the resent- 
ment of the whole Continent. 

I am daily and hourly making as fair weather as possible of this 
transaction, and a painful task it is. It is one I am unused to, and 
therefore, labor hard, to gloss over what I condemn from the bottom 
of my soul. But my principles are — (the Eye of my God knows 
them, and the most envioi^s eye of man or the bitterest tongue of 



81 



'slander cannot find anything in my political conduct to contradict 
them,) — they are, to sacrifice all lesser considerations to the service 
of the Whole, and in this tempestuous season to throw cheerfully 
overboard private fortune, private emoluments, and all partial or in- 
terested views, even my Life, — if the ship with the jewel Liherfi/ 
on board may be saved. This being ,my line of conduct, I have a 
calmness of mind, I thank God, resulting from such resolutions, 
which more than balances every external trouble; of which I have 
not a few, and of which the late conduct of a part of our officers, 
in support of Spencer, is not the least. Inclosed I send a letter for 
Parsons, which please to read, then copy, seal, and forward. I will 
say no more on the very disagreeable subject, than that the copy 
and this letter may hereafter shew my sentiments at the time. 

I am glad our Assembly did not interpose in favor of Spencer. 
They have hereby acted up to the high character they sustain with 
the Congress ; and the only consistent part he, Spencer, can now 
act, is to throw up his commission and give place to men who do 
not think it degrading to serve their Country, though they have not 
the highest feather in their cap. Let them look at Major Mifflin, 
who is a member of the Continental Congress, a respectable one, too, 
yet he condescends to act as Aid-de-camj}, and, of course, ranks no 
higher than Samuel B- AVebb, whose appointment I rejoice at, not 
because he was my friend, but because he merits it; and will, if it 
please God to preserve him, make an officer of the first rank and 
character, when some blusterers of the present hour are forgotten, 
or I am much mistaken. 

At the time I recommended Capt. Chester, I did not think he 
would accept, but I knew he deserved it ; on that motive I acted ; 
his conduct has justified my voice in his favor, and will, I doubt 
not, justify what I have said and wrote to the Generals in his favor ; 
and expect soon to hear of his promotion, which I have with pleasure. 
I recommended, without solicitation, my friend, Jos. Trumbull, and 
have been happy enough to find him successful in an honorable and 
important, though a very laborious station. My interest in our 
Assembly has been something ; in the Congress, it is as large as my 
'vanity could wish ; but God forbid I ever use it but to promote the 
meritorious; and my rule of judging of those must be, by actual 
specimens of their conduct, not by Squireship or Cousinship. 

Aflfectionately, 

Silas Deane.

From tlie Committee of Secret Correspondence to Silas Deane.* 

Philadelphia, March 3d, 1776. 

On your arrival in France, yon will for some time be engaged in 
the business of providing goods for the Indian trade. This will give 
good countenance to your appearing in the character of a merchant, 
which we wish you to continually retain among the French, in gen- 
eral, it being probable that the court of France may not like it 
should be known publicly, that any agent from the Colonies is in 
that country. When you go to Paris, by deliveiing Dr. Franklin's 
letter to Monsieur Le Roy, at the Louvre, and M. Dubourg, you will 
be introduced to a set of acquaintance, all friends to the Americans. 
By conversing with them, you will have a good opportunity of ac- 
quiring Parisian French, and you will find in M. Dubourg, a man 
prudent, faithful, secret, intelligent in ali'airs, and capable of giving 
you very sage advice. 

It is scarce necessary to pretend any other business at Paris, 
than the gratifying of that curiosity, which draws numbers thither 
yearly, merely to see so famous a city. With the assistance of 
Monsieur Dubourg, who understands English, you will be able to 
make immediate application to Monsieur de Vergennes, Ministre 
des Affaires Estrangeres, either personally or by letter, if M. Du- 
bourg adopts that method, acquainting him that you are in France 
upon business of the American Congress, in the character of a mer- 
chant, having something to communicate to him, that may be mu- 
tually beneficial to France and the North American Colonies ; that 
you request an audience of him, and that he would be pleased to 
ajipoint the time and place. At this audience if agreed to, it ijiay 
be well to show him first your letter of credence, and then acquaint 
him that the Congress, finding that in the common course of com- 
merce, it was not practicable to furnish the continent of America 
with the quantity of arms and ammunition necessary for its defence, 
(the Ministry of Great Britain having been extremely industrious to 
prevent it), you had been despatched by their authority to apply to 
some European power for a supply. That France had been pitched 

* Reprinted from the Diplomatic Correspondeice of the American Revolution, (vol. i., 
pp. 5-9.) The first volamee of that collection contains Mr. Deane'e letters to the Committee 
of Secret Oorreepondence and the Committee of Foreign Affaire, from his arrival at Paris, 
July 7th, 1776, till hlfi recall, and his communication to the President of progress, after hi& 
return to Ame'ic_, July 9th, 177S. 



83 

on for the first application, from an 02')inion, that if wc should, as 
there is a great appearance we shall, come to a total separation from 
Great Britain, France would be looked upon as the power, whose 
friendship it would be fittest for us to obtain and cultivate. That 
the commercial advantages Britain had enjoyed with the Colonies, 
had contributed greatly to hei" late wealth and importance. That 
it is likely great part of our commerce will naturally fall to France ; 
especially if she favor us in this application, as that will be a means 
of gaining and securing the friendship of the Colonies; and that as 
our trade was rapidly increasing with our increase of people, and in 
a greater proportion, her part of it will be extremely valuable. That 
the supply we at present want, is clothing and arms for twenty-five 
thousand men, with a suitable quantity of ammunition, and one hun- 
dred field pieces. That we mean to pay for the same by remittances 
to France, through Spain, Portugal, or the French Islands, as soon 
as our navigation can be protected by ourselves or our friends and 
that we, besides, want great quantities of linens and woolens, with 
other articles for the Indian trade, which you are now actually pur- 
chasing, and for which you ask no credit, and that the whole, if 
France should grant the other supplies, would make a cargo which 
it might be well to secure by a convoy of two or three ships of war. 
If you should find M. de Vergennes reserved, and not inclined 
to enter into free conversation with you, it may be well to shorten 
your visit ; request him to consider what you have proposed ; ac- 
quaint him with your place of lodging ; that you may yet stay some 
time at Paris, and that knowing how precious his time is, you do 
not presume to ask another audience ; but that if he should have 
any commands for you, you will, upon the least notice, immediately 
wait upon him. If, at a future conference, he should be more free, 
and you find a disposition to favor the Colonies, it may be proper 
to acquaint him, that they must necessarily be anxious to know the 
disposition of France, on certain points, which, with his permission, 
you would mention ; such as, whether, if the Colonies should be 
forced to form themselves into an independent state, France would 
probably acknowledge them as such ; receive their embassadors ; 
enter into any treaty or alliance with them, for commerce or defence, 
or both? If so, on what principal conditions? Intimating that you 
shall speedily have an opportunity of sending to America, if you do 
not immediately return, and that he may be assured of your fidelity 



84 

and secrecy in transmitting carefully anything he would wish con- 
veyed to the Congress on that subject. In subsequent conversations, 
you may, as you find it convenient, enlarge on these topics, that 
have been the subjects of our conferences with you, to which you 
may occasionally add the well-known substantial answers we usually 
give to the several calumnies thrown out against us. If these sup- 
plies on the credit of the Congress should be refused, you are then 
to endeavor the obtaining a permission of purchasing those articles, 
or as much of them as you can find credit for. You will keep a 
daily journal of all your material transactions, and particularly of 
what passes in your conversations with great personages ; and you 
will by every safe opportunity, furnish us with such information as 
may be important. When your business in France admits of it, it 
may be well to go into Holland, and visit our agent there, Mr. Du- 
mas, conferring with him on subjects that may promote our inter- 
est, and on the means of communication. 

You will endeavor to procure a meeting with Mr. Bancroft by 
writing a letter to him, under cover to Mr. Griffith's, at Turnham 
Green, near London, and desiring him to come over to you, in 
France or Holland, on the score of old acquaintance. From him 
you may obtain a good deal of information of what is now going 
forward in England, and settle a mode of continuing a correspond- 
ence.- It may be well to remit him a small bill to defray his ex- 
penses in coming to you, and avoid all political matters in your 
letter to him. You will also endeavor to correspond with Mr. 
Arthur Lee, agent of the Colonies in London. You will endeavor to 
obtain acquaintance with M. Garnier, late Charge lies Affaires de 
France d' Angleferre, if now in France, or if returned to England, 
a correspondence with him, as a person extremely intelligent and 
friendly to our cause. From him you may learn many particulars 
occasionally, that will be useful to us.

of this Letter. I have wrote you several, & am surprised to learn 
that you have not received them as I sunt them open, & the Con- 
tents were inoffensive. I fondly hoped you would, before this, have 
been exchanged, for I am extremely impatient to see you thougli it 
were but for a few Days, thus as the last resource, I proposed to 
Capt. Duncan that at least you might be permitted to come out on 
your parole for a few weeks. I wrote you a Letter by him open, 
which you mu6t have received before this will come to hand. I pray 
you to take care of your health, and to write me by every opportunity 
just to let me know how you are, as to health, & if I shall not have 
the pleasure of seeing you, yet I shall be no less anxious for your 
release, to obtain which nothing in my power shall be wanting. 
I am, my Dear Sir, yours most affectionately,

Prom Mrs. Lamb's History of the City of New York, p. 70. 

" A secret Congressional Committee, of whom John Jay and 
Franklin were conspicuous members, despatched Silas Deane, of 
Connecticut, to France, on a mission of the utmost delicacy, — that 
of learning how far assistance might be expected from that Nation, 
in case the Colonies should form themselves into an independent 
State. 

" Deane was an accomplished, college-bred man, of elegant 
manners and striking appearance, accustomed to a showy style of 
living, equijiage and appointment, and a natural diplomat. He was 
^Chairmanjof the Committee of Safety in Connecticut, and his resi- 
dence was the rendezvous of nearly all the public characters of the 
period. William Livingston speaks of it as ' Hospitality Hall,' and 
Lossing describes it as the ' Webb House.' 



81 

" Silas Deane married the widowed mother of Samuel B. Webb, 
in 1764. The 'Webb House,' iu Wethersfield, was where Wash- 
ington and Rochambeau met in 1881, and arranged the campaign 
against Cornwallis in Virginia. The suites of the two commanders, 
consisting of forty-five persons each, were distributed among the 
people of Wethersfield. Only Washington and Rochambeau slept 
in the great double house, with its hall in the centre, and rooms on 
each side, with wall decorations of rich, crimson velvet papsr. 

" Samuel B. Webb, afterwards General, was descended in tlio 
■direct line from Richard Webb, who came to Boston from Glouces- 
tershire, England, in 1633, and in connection with Hooker, Hop- 
kins and Willys, settled Hartford in 1635. He was wounded in the 
battle of Bunker Hill, immediately after which, at the age of twen- 
ty-one, he was appointed Aid-de-Camp to Putnam ; and in June, 
1776, was made private Secretary and Aid-de-Camp to Washing- 
ton, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. He was the father of 
General J.. Watson Webb, and the grandfather of General Alexan- 
der S. Webb, President of the New York City College."

The Historical Magazine for June, 1880, published by Barnes 
& Co., Ill William Street, and edited by John Austin Stevens, 
Esq., contained the following biographical sketch by Mr. Stevens, 
well known as one of the most accomplished historians of our 
country, in everything relating to Eevolutionary affairs. 

I should have mentioned sooner that while Washington would 
Y not consent to my father's exchange out of turn, he appointed 
, him Commissary General for the exchange of prisoners, the duties 
of which station he performed until he himself was exchanged. 

\^From the Historical Magazine of June, 1880.] 
GENERAL SAMUEL BLATCHLEY WEBB, 

COLONEL IN THE CONNECTICUT LINE AND BREVET BEIGADIER 
GENERAL IN THE CONTINENTAL ARMY. 

The family of Webb, of Connecticut, of whom Colonel 
Samuel Blatchley Webb, of the Connecticut line of the Conti- 
nental Army was one, was a branch of that of the Webbs of Mol- 
comb. County Dorset, England, to which arms were granted on 
the 17th June, 1577. 

Richard, the first emigrant, appears in the old New England 
records as one of the settlers of Cambridge in 1633. This body 
of men composed the Braintree Company, known as Mr. 
Hooker's company, which in 1034 sent out messengers "to dis- 
cover Connecticut river, intending to remove their town thither ; 
and in the summer of 1630 one hundred strong men, women and 
children traveled over a hundred miles through a hideous and 
trackless wilderness and sat down at Hartford. Richard Webb 
was no doubt one of this adventurous party. His name appears 
as one of the original proprietors of Hartford in 1639, and in 
many positions of trust. A few years later he removed to Stam- 
ford, of which he was also one of the first settlers. Here he died 
in 1676, ' a gentleman of standing in the colony.' " With regard 
to his descendants, genealogists differ ; but superior credence must 
be given to the record of Hinman in his catalogue of names of 
the first Puritan settlers of Connecticut, which agrees in the main 
with the traditions and records of the family. 

Samuel Blatchley Webb, the subject of the present memoir, 
the sixth in rlegcent (all of his immediate ancestors being of the 



89 

name of Joseph), from Richard, the first settler, was born at 
Wethersfield December 3d, 1753. He was the son of Joseph '^ 
Webb and Mehetabel Nott 'his wife, who, after her husband's , 
death in 1763, was married on the 2d November, 17G3, to Silas ^ 
Deane of Wethersfield. 

Although young Webb was never graduated from any college, 
his correspondence shows that he received a thorough education 
and a literary training uncommon to the period. This no doubt 
he owed to the care of his step-father, Mr. Deane, who was him- 
self graduated from Yale in 1758'. At the outbreak of the Revo- 
lution, Silas Deane was a leading spirit in the Connecticut Colony. 
lie represented it in the first Continental Congress in 1774, of 
which he was one of the early promoters. Later he was entrusted 
with maay important commissions. Part of his extensive corres- 
pondence is preserved in the collection of the Connecticut Histor- 
ical Society. His letters to his wife are full of minute detail, re- 
lating to persons and events, charming in their natural and 
picturesque style. 

Young Samuel Webb appears to have been high in the favor 
of Mr. Deane, and to have visited him in Philadelphia while 
Congress was in session. In a letter to his brother Joseph, 7th 
April, 1774, he speaks of dining with the Congress to the number 
of 400 the day preceding. On his return home he was requested 
by Mr. Deane to address him on all matters of imjjortance. One 
of his letters presents an interesting picture of the spirit of the 
youth of the day, and shows the consequence in which the writer 
was already held among them. It is dated October 10, 1774. 

The sisters of young Webb were then in Boston, which he 
describes as the "present seat of noise and confusion." General 
Gage, the military governor, had already commenced to treat the 
town as under martial law, and was erecting fortifications and 
mounting cannon to command the harbor and enforce the Port 
Act. Webb was alarmed for the safety of his sisters, and was 
about setting off to bring them to a place of safety. The spirit 
of Connecticut was thoroughly aroused. " On the first hostility, 
such as bloodshed by the troops in Boston, this colony (writes 
Webb) will most undoubtedly be immediately under arms and 
march for Boston." The same letter supplies some interesting 
details of his own connection with military affairs. "The Light 



00 

Infantry of Middletown, to which I two years belonged, have now 
a fine stand of arms, which I purchased for them in New York on 
my return home from Philadelphia. They have given me an in- 
vitation to make one of the number, should any emergency call 
their appearance in the field, which with my whole heart I shall 
readily accept if occasion [demand]. But Heaven forbid we may 
ever arrive at this unhappy crisis ! But all have drawn their 
arms, and myself among the rest ;" and he continues with an 
account of his j^ersonally visiting the different towns in the neigh- 
borhood, where he was rejoiced to find that the "thirst of liberty, 
which had so long been buried in silence, seemed again to rear its 
head." At this time young Webb had not yet reached his major- 
ity. But character matures rapidly in time of trouble. 

The hour of trial was close at hand. The guns of Lexington 
aroused the Continent, and their echoes had hardly died away be- 
fore the tramp of hardy yeomanry was heard on every road leading 
to Boston, the beleaguered city. Connecticut was early in the field. 
Putnam, who left his plough in the furrow, was in Concord the 
second day after the battle. The military organizations were not 
far behind. The First Connecticut Regiment, under command of 
General Joseph Spencer, was on the ground by the first day of 
May. Connecticut at this period named generals to the command 
of her regiments, which were not yet arranged in any Continental 
system. Spencer's regiment was attached to the right wiog, 
which General John Thomas commanded, and was stationed at 
Roxbury and Dorchester, and in their neighborhood- In General 
Spencer's regiment marched Major John Chester, of Wethersfield, 
who commanded a company, and in the same command young 
Webb held a Lieutenant's commission. The Middletown troops 
did not march till later. A letter from Titus Hosmer to Silas 
Deane (May 28, 1775) says that " Mr. Samuel Webb marched on 
Thursday ;" this was the 25th of the month. There still remains 
in the possession of the family a neat little manuscript volume in 
the handwriting of Webb, entitled, " Regimental Orders Re- 
view of the Sixth Regiment of Militia, in the Colony of Connec- 
ticut, on the 9th day of May, 1775." It is minute in instructions 
for the movements of the regiment, and contains a plan of form- 
ation with the names of the oificers. 

When_. '^n the advice of the Committee of Safety, the com- 



91 

mander of the army resolved to fortify Bunker Hill, two hundred 
of the Connecticut men were draughted from several comjianies 
and placed under the command of Thomas Knowlton, of General 
Putnam's regiment, tlie second in the Connecticut line. Part of 
Captain Chester's company was included in the draught, and both 
he and Lieutenant Webb were present in the eventful struggle. 

A letter written from camp by Captain Chester three days 
after gives one of the most reliable accounts of the battle, and of 
the part taken in it by the Connecticut troops. It describes, too, 
the uniform of the corps as " wholly blue, turned up with red ;" 
but when marching or in their barracks, " loath to expose them- 
selves by their dress, they put their frocks and trousers on over 
their other clothes. Lieutenant Webb also describes his part in 
the action in a graphic and natural way. He speaks of his feeling 
of doubt as ' he descended into the valley from oil Bunker Hill 
side by side of Captain Chester at the head of their company,' and 
his doubt as to whether 'he should ever rise the hill again, 
as Elijah did, body and soul together.' The balls flew pretty 
thick about his command, but he escaped with a wound in the 
head. All accounts concur in according high credit to the 
conduct of the Connecticut troops on this occasion. In the Con- 
necticut Courant, a Hartford Journal, a "Friend to Truth," in a 
letter published on the 31st June, noticed the bravery of the 
ofiBcers of their locality, and particularly called attention to 
" Major John Chestar, of Wethersfield, now Captain of a com- 
pany in General Spencer's Eegiment, and Lieut. Samuel Webb, 
who marched up to the line with their men, and re-inforced the 
troops (and), by their undaunted behavior, timely and vigorous 
assistance, it is universally agreed, are justly entitled to the grate- 
ful acknowledgments of their Country." 

On the 15th June, the day of the action at Bunker Hill, the 
Continental Congress completed the organization of the American 
army by the election of its general officers. Washington was 
chosen to the chief command. He was on the point of departure 
for the field of operations in Massachusetts Bay when the thrilling 
news of the fight at Bunker Hill reached Philadelphia in a very 
confused account. On the morning of Friday, the 23d, he set out 
from Philadelphia for the camp at Cambridge, accompanied by a 
troop of horse. On the afternoon of the 24th he landed at Col- 



fi-3 



onel Lispenard's seat in New York. Leaving in the afternoon of 
the 26th, he passed the night at Kingsbridge (at Dyckman's tavern 
no doubt), and the next morning pushed on to Hartford, which 
he reached on the 29th, in company with General Lee. He was 
the bearer of a letter from Silas Deane, who was again a represen- 
tative for Connecticut in the Second Continental Congress, which 
had convened in Philadelphia the May jjrevious. In this letter 
Mr. Deane particularly commended his Excellency and his retinue 
to the care and attention of his wife, and instructed her, " should 
they lodge a night in Wetherstield, to accommodate their horses, 
servants, &c., in the best manner a-t the taverns, and their retinue 
will likely go on to Hartford." This implies an understanding 
that the General woiild make his headquarters at the house of 
Mrs. Deane during his temporary residence at the capital of Con- 
necticut. The building thus honored was a house of some conse- 
quence and the home of the Webb family. Mr. Joseph Webb, 
the elder brother of Lieut. Samuel, was then living in Wethers- 
field, and the head of the family, though apparently, from the 
fact of Mr. Deane sending his " respects to him and the whole of 
both families," not residing with his mother. 

Tt is a matter of regret that the letter of Mrs. Deane of the 
3d July, describing the visit of Washington, has not been preserved; 
at least it does not appear in the published Deane correspondence* 
to which reference has been made, but there can be no doubt of the 
nature of her opinion of her guest, as Mr. Deane, on the 8th July, 
1775, takes pains to express his gratitude that it agreed with his own. 
In the same letter occurs a phrase which shows that he had inter- 
ested himself in behalf of his young kinsman. Mr. Joseph Webb 
appears to have accompanied Washington to camp, a fact, which Mr. 
Deane expresses the hope, " will enable him to procure a berth for 
Samuel Webb which he recommended him to, an honorable, thougli 
a dangerous one, but which he thinks must now be his course of life 
for the future." 

In June Mr. Deane wrote to young Webb that he had asked 
General Putnam for a position for him on his staflf, and advised him 
to apply instantly in person. He informs his wife of this in July, 
and expresses his satisfaction, not because he was his friend, but be- 
cause he merits it, and will, if it please God to preserve him, make 
an officer of ^e first rank and charaoter. While on Putnam's staff 



93 

Webb seems to have been occasionally employed on confidential 
service. There is a letter among the Webb manuscripts from Jos. 
Eeed, Washington's secretary, charging him to receive and conduct 
prisoners to Hartford to be delivered over to the Committee of Safety, 
and report to AVashington in person. The appointment of Putnam 
by Congress as one of the four Major-Generals of the army, made 
the post of Aid-de-Camp on his staff one of importance. 

On the evacuation of Boston by the British troops, New York 
was the centre of observation, both tlie British and American com- 
manders alike recognizing it as the key of the continent, and it 
soon became the pivotal point of military operations. Washington 
immediately moved his forces thither, and Putnam was entrusted 
with the command of the city and the erection of works for its 
defense- Putnam arrived on the evening of Wednesday, April .3, 
1776, and on the 4th notified Congress of the proceedings he had 
taken. He made his headquarters in New York at the Kennedy 
House, No. 1 Broadway, which was also the army headquarters 
while he was in command. This house has been, and is still, known 
as Washington's Headquarters, but there is no evidence that the 
commander-in-chief ever resided there. 

His dispositions were marked by extreme good sense, and his 
general orders were expressed in clear, soldierly style. As Old Put. 
was never distinguished for any literary merit, it is not unfair to 
attribute these qualities of the orders to the scholarship and good 
taste of his chief of staff. Moreover, there is direct evidence that 
Webb's opinions were asked and followed. In May he submitted a 
"plan for General Putnam's consideration to employ tlie armed 
vessels under his command, and which will prevent the King's ships 
from being supplied with fresh Provisions by the enemies of Amer- 
ica," etc. (Force Archives.) This scheme included a patrol by 
whale-boats of the western shore, from Amboy to Sandy Hook, of 
Rockaway and the adjacent islands and inlet by Sound schooners, 
attended by whale boats, and Fire Island Inlet and the entire west- 
ern shore, " even down to Egg Harbor, one hundred and forty miles 
range from Sandy Hook, in a similar manner." The plan received 
the commendation of tlie Committee of Safety, and was adopted by 
General Putnam. 

Honorable as was his post, the young officer was not content. 
He had long had an inclination to make one of the military family 



04 

of Washington. This desire he expressed to Eeed, who was in need 
of au assistant, and Reed wrote to Washington from Philadelphia on 
the 3d March, 1776, that if the i^ost be agreeable to Webb, and he 
agreeable to General Washington, he should prefer him to any other. 
To this Washington replied on the 25th from Cambridge, that Mr. 
Webb would be " agreeable enough " to him if Col. Eeed thought 
him " qualified for the business." His powerful friend, Mr. Deane, 
was already in France on the famous embassy, concerning which 
there is still an open controversy, but his influence remained, and 
Reed secured the appointment of young Webb. 

On the 21st June, 1776, the general orders, dated New York, 
announced that " the General " (Washington had arrived in the city 
on the 8tli June, and assumed the command) " had been pleased to 
appoint Richard Gary and Samuel Webb, Esquires, to be his Aids- 
de-Oamp, and Alexander Contee Harrison, Esqr., Assistant Secre- 
tary, who are to be obeyed and regarded as such." The general 
orders added : " The honorable Congress have been pleased to give 
the rank of Lieutenant Colonel to the Aids-de Camp of the Com- 
mander-in-Chief, and to his principal Secretary; and the rank of 
Major to the Aids-de-Camp of the Majors-General." The military 
secretary of Washington at this period was Robert Hanson Harri- 
son, Esquire, appointed on the 16th May of the same year (1776) in 
the room of Joseph Reed who had resigned the position and taken 
the appointment of Adjutant-General of the Army. This was the 
military family of General Washington, as the staff were called in 
the parlance of the day. 

The journal and general order book, or rather a general order 
book, with occasional notes under the title of Remarks and Occur- 
rences, entirely in the handwriting of Lieutenant-Colonel Webb, re- 
mains to attest his method, his accuracy and his neatness. Histirst 
note informs us that, agreeable to the orders of the day (June 31), 
Col. Gary and himself removed to the headquarters as Aids-de- 
Camp to his Excellency. These headquarters were then at the 
Mortier House, an elegant residence without the lines of the city, 
built by the Paymaster-General of the Royal forces. It was in a 
delightful situation, celebrated for its natural beauty. It was later 
known as Richmond Hill, the home of Aaron Burr. This charm- 
ing site was selected no doubt because of the presence of Lady 
Washington <\a the newspapers of the day styled the wife of the 



95 

Commandei'-iu-Chief. The city was overrun with troops, and tiiero 
was great fear of the small-pox, which had decimated the army iu 
Canada, and was dreaded to an extent hardly to be estimated now. 

With Mrs. Washington came Mr. and Mrs. Custis, members of 
the family. It was in this intimacy that the manners and accom- 
plishments of young Webb endeared him to General Washington, 
who from this time forward always addressed him in terms of aftec- 
tionate attachment, and lost no opportunity to advance his fortunes 
and show him marks of liis esteem for his character and his capacity. 

Events now hurried rapidly along, and were as rapidly recorded 
in the Aid-de-Camp's diary. The arrival of the Britisli ileet on tlie 
39th of June, the false alarm of an attack on the 2d July, the efforts 
to defend the posts against the formidable and daily increasing 
armaments, the enthusiastic reception of the Declaration of Inde- 
pendence, and the overthrow of the gilded statue of George III., 
are all noticed. The following entries are of peculiar value as from 
a participant in the scenes they relate. 

" New York, July 14, 1776.— A Flag of Truce from the fleet 
appeared, on which Colo Reed and myself went down to meet it, 
about half way between Governors & Staten Island; Lieut Brown 
of the Eagle offered a Letter from Lord Howe, directed George 
Washington Esqr, wliich on acct of its direction we refused to Re- 
ceive, and parted with the usual compliments. . . . 

" Neio York, July 16, 1776.— A Flag this day to send to Gen- 
eral Howe some spirited Resolves of Congress, respecting the 
Cruelty and Barbarity of the King's Troops and Savages to the 
Northward, and acquainting him Retaliation shall immediately take 
place, unless a final stop is put to such inhuman and Barbarous con- 
duct. . . . 

" Neic York, July 17, 1776.— A flag from the Enemy with an 
answer from General Howe abt the Resolves sent yesterday — Di- 
rected George Washington, &c., &c., &c., which was refused. 

" New York, lOth July, 1776.— A fla^^ appeared this morning 
when Colo Reed and myself went down — General Howe met us — 
and said as there appeared an insurmountable obstacle between the 
two Geterals by way of corresponding— General Howe desired his 
Adjutant General might be admitted to an interview with his Ex- 
cellency General Washington, — on which Colo Reed, in the name 



fifi 

of General Washington, consented and pledged his lienor for his 
being safe returned, — the aid de Camp said the Adjt Genl would 
meet us tomorrow forenoon. 

•'New York, 20lh July, 177G.— At 13 o'clock.'we met the 

Flag, took Lieut Colo Paterson of the Eegiment into our 

Barge and escorted him safe to Town to Colo Knox's Quarters, 
where his Excellency General Washington, attended with his suit 
and Life Guard, Received and had an interview of about an hour 
with him; we then escorted him back in safety to his own Barge; 
on going and coming we passed in Front of the Grand Battery — 
but did not blindfold him — Sociable and chatty all the way." 

A few of Colonel Webb's letters, written at this period by 
Washington's orders, remain. Force has published two addressed 
to General Ward, July 18, 1776, in reference to the improper acts 
of the agent in the disposal of cargoes of the prizes taken; anoth- 
er to Governor Trumbull with regard to the ill-conduct of the 
Connecticut Life Guards, who refused to do duty except on horse- 
back, pleading exemption by statute of the Colony. The General 
had no use for such particular jDatriots, and dischaged them. On 
the 27th July, 1776, he again addresses General Ward at Boston, 
to forward the ammunition taken in the British transports with- 
out delay to New York. 

The diary of Colonel Webb closes with the entry of the 20th 
July, recording the arrival of Lord Howe's fleet " with the For- 
eigners," meaning the Hessian troops. Colonel Webb was with 
his commander during the sumnier of 1776, and was no doubt 
present at the battles of Long Island and Harlem though no rec- 
ord remains of his special service in these actions. Two letters, 
signed by him remain, written from headquarters, then at the 
Roger Morris house, on the heights of Harlem, dated October 1 
and October 6, informing Heath, who commanded the division on 
the continent above, of the movements of the enemy on Long 
Island Sound and the Harlem River, whom he justly suspected of 
an attempt to turn his rear. He was present at White Plains, 
where, while carrying orders in an exposed position across the 
field, he had his horse shot under him and was himself wounded 
in the leg. Continuing with his chief during the passage of the 
Hudson a'^'^, the dark days of the close of 1776, he again rendered 



07 

eflBcient service in the line of his duty in the affair at Trenton on 
Christmas eve. Johnston, in his History of tlie C'ampaijjn of 
1776, mentions him as having conveyed the order to Sullivan's 
troops, whose muskets had been wet in the heavy storm at the 
crossing of the Delaware, " that if the men could not discharge 
their pieces they must use the bayonet, for the Town must be 
taken." 

At the close of the year 1776, the American army under its 
short term of enlistment, had almost faded away. Washington 
wrote on the 20th December: " Ten days more will put an end to 
its existence." 

On the 16th September Congress passed a resolution to enlist 
eighty-eight battalions to serve during the war, and the number 
of eight was set down as the quota for Connecticut. The organ- 
ization of these eight battalions was completed by Governor Trum- 
bull and the Council of Safety or Committee of War of Connecti- 
cut at their session of the 28th November, and the generals of the 
State in the service were desired to arrange the officers. But 
Washington was by no means satisfied with the provision of eighty- 
eight battalions, and strongly urged the Congress not to lose a 
moment in raising " a greater number, not less than a hundred 
and ten;" and on the 22d they passed a resolution, vesting him 
with full, ample and complete powers to raise sixteen battalions 
of infantry in addition to those already voted, and to appoint 
their officers. Colonel Webb immediately availed of this occasion 
to break from the dependence, which, even so honorable position 
as aid to the Commander-in Chief gave him, and sought distinc- 
tion in more active service, and on the 11th January was appoint- 
ed colonel of one of ten regiments organized under this act. 
These sixteen additional regiments were established on a different 
footing from the eighty-eight battalions. In these the appoint- 
ment of the officers was left to the States, but under the authority 
given to the commander-in-chief the appointment of officers un- 
der the rank of field officers was delegated to the colonels in con- 
cert with the field officers of their commands, the right of ratifi- 
cation or rejection being reserved to himself. The regiments were 
raised for three years or the war. 

The Connecticut government decided on the 26th February 
that the proportion of men to be raised by Connecticut was one 



98 

thousand, and directed the bounty money be distributed as follows, 
tIz.: to those under Colonel Samuel B. Webb, to the number of 500; 
to those under Lieut.-Colonel R. J. Meigs, 250; to those under Lieut. - 
Colonel Thomas Dyer, 250. In addition to the twenty dollars 
bounty fixed by the Congress, Colonel Webb was lavish with his 
means and credit to hasten the-enlistment of his command. A roll 
of the enlisted men, 392 in number, styles the regiment, " that 
known by the name of one of the 10 additional Regiments," after- 
wards the Ninth and the Third Connecticut Regiments. Some of 
the original printed enlistment forms have the name of the " Regi- 
ment of Guards commanded by Colonel Samuel B. Webb " but the 
word guards is carefully crossed out from the paper. The records 
of Connecticut so far made public are sadly deficient in information 
concerning the troojis, but it may be found from the minutes of the 
Council in April and June, that they were still not entirely equipped 
and were petitioning for clothing. A surgeon's mate was appointed 
for the regiment July 4, 1777. About this time the regiment joined 
the army on the Hudson. Among the Webb documents is an order 
from Genl. Parsons, directing Col. Webb to parade in the street 
[Peekskill] and march to Crompond with three days' ammunition ; 
and the draft of a regimental order by Col. Webb, dated Fairfield, 
Conn., 21st August, evidently on the eve of an expected movement. 
This expedition against the British posts on the Long Island coast 
of the Sound does not seem to have been carried out, but Webb's 
regiment probably remained in Connecticut, as in October General 
Parsons again wrote to Webb complaining of his own inactivity, his 
brigade not yet being completed, but announcing his early departure. 
His destination he reveals in the expressive phrase ' oysters and 
black-fish will soon be my lot,' an allusion to the diet of the dwellers 
by the Sound. He presses Webb to find means to join his brigade, 
from which letter it seems that Webb's regiment was not as yet per- 
manently attached. That his ranks were not yet full is learned 
from a letter of Washington among the Webb papers. Webb was 
no doubt busy increasing the number of his men. 

Soon after, the active military career of Colonel Webb was un- 
fortunately cut short by the disastrous result of the expedition 
formed by General Parsons against the enemies' posts on Long 
Island, December 16, 1777. The contemporaneous account of this 



90 

affair in the Connecticut Gazette (December 10,1777) not appear- 
ing to have been reprinted is here given. 

"A plan having been formed to bring offer destroy a Magazine 
of Military Stores which the Enemy had, at Shetochet on Long 
Island, and to destroy some shipping loaded with Timber at South- 
old — on Tuesday Night of last week part of two Battalions of 
Troops embarked from this State, under convoy of the Sloop 
Schuyler, and the Spy and Mifflin Schooners. Unfortunately the 
next morning, just before Light, the Faulkland, a British Frigate, in 
her Passage from New York to Newport came a-cross the Schuyler 
and two Smaller Vessels, when the latter run a-shore upon the 
Island, but the former, on attempting to get in with the Larid, run 
upon a Spit of Sand called the Old-Man's, and was taken with 
about sixty Troops on Board, among whom were the following 
Officers, viz.: Cols. Ely and Webb, Capt. Buckland, Lieut. Riley, 
Ensn Mumford, Adjutant Hopkins, and Quarter Master Starr of 
Webb's Battalion, and Ensigns Niles and Abbott and Adjutant 
West of Ely's Battalion. On Thursday a Party of men under Capt. 
Hart marched to Southold and were very near making Prisoners of 
Capt. Ascough and upwards of 20 Men belonging to the ship Swan 
who were at a House in Southold, but they getting Intelligence of 
Capt Hart's Approach hasted to their Boats. They were closely 
pursued, and as they were getting on Board were fired upon, when 
most of them were killed or wounded, Capt Ayscough it is tho'twas 
killed. Seven Marines and Seamen were made Prisoners. Our 
Troops, after tarrying several Days on the Island, returned to the 
Main, without having opportunity to affect any thing considerable — 
the Shipping having left Southold and we learn the Magazine has 
been removed." 

Partisan warfare is the most uncertain branch of the profes- 
sion. The least miscalculation affects the whole plan. The main 
portion of Colonel Webb's battalion escaped capture; their return 
from Long Island is noticed in the Connecticut Gazette letter of 
the 26th December. They were marched from New London to 
Peekskill, where they remained on duty during the following year 
as a part of the Highland garrison. They were later consolidated 
with the other Connecticut troops on the Continental establish- 
ment in January, 1781. 

Colonel Webb, as is stated in the same number of the Gazette, 
was carried to Newport, where, after remaining a few days, he 
was allowed to come out on parole, and went to Wethersfield. 
This, however, seems to have been premature. The Council min- 
utes note that " Lieut Col Lawrence was voted to be exchanged 



100 

for Col Samuel Webb; and Lawrence to go to New York on his 
parole, and if not exchanged, to return by the 6tli of February, 
1778." His orginal parole is preserved. It is quoted as an ex- 
ample. 'I, Samuel B. Webb, of Wethersfield, in Connecticut, 
having leave to go to Long Island on Parole, do hereby jjledge my 
Faith & Word of Honor that I will not do or say any thing con- 
trary to the interest of his Majesty or his Government, and that 
I will not depart from the House I am placed in by the Commis- 
sary for Prisoners nor go beyond the Bounds by him presented. 
Given under my Hand this Twenty fifth Day of February, 1778;" 
and on the margin is endorsed, "A new one given 14th May, 
1778." 

Colonel Webb was carried to New York, but in common with 
most of the American officers on parole, was dissatisfied with the 
treatment extended to them by the British oflicers, and at his re- 
quest was permitted to leave the city, the parole limits not ex- 
tending beyond Flushing; but this change does not appear to have 
been a change for the better, for at Flatbush the prisoners were 
consigned to the custody of Colonel William Axtell and his 
nejihew. Captain Frederick De Peyster, both strong tories. Their 
command, according to the Reverend Dr. Thomas M. Strong, 
whose History of Flatbush is the best local authority, " was taken 
from the lowest ranks, and were mostly persons of bad moral 
character. The company was called the Nassau Blues, but from 
their low and generally miserable appearance, were nick-named 
by the inhabitants the ' Nasty Blues.' " 

The exchange of prisoners was a subject of constant trouble 
and dissatisfaction, there beiug for a long period no settled basis of 
exchange. 

Soon after his capture, 29th December, 1777, Colonel Webb 
addressed a letter to General Washington, informing him of his mis- 
fortune and entreating his personal interference to procure a sjiecial 
exchange. He named Lieutenat Colonel Campbell as a fit subject 
for exchange. Naturally this application failed, the general properly 
observing that there were " several officers now in captivity with the 
Enemy of your Rank, taken at Three Rivers in 1775, at Long Island, 
Fort Washington and Germantown." "So far as Exchanges have 
depended on me, or as they may rest with me," said the general in 
his reply of January 8, 1778, " they have been, and ever will be, 



101 

conducted on one principle, to wit : to release those first who were 
first captured as far as circumstances of rank would apply. There 
is no other rule by which impartial justice can be done." This 
reply could not have been uuexjiected to Colonel Webb. In his 
letter to the General he confesses that from the letters which passed 
between Washington, when he was on his stall', and General Howe, 
he had little reason " to flatter himself of it taking place." There 
being no other way of release but a general exchange, Colonel 
Webb turned himself with his usual' energy to this object, and en- 
deavored, both by interview and correspondence with British officers 
in a similar situation as himself, such as Phillips, Reidesel, and other 
Convention prisoners, and with Loring, the British Commissary- 
General of prisoners, to devise a plan which would be mutually 
satisfactory. The difficulties in the way of any arrangement are 
more easily discernible now than they were then ; the motives of 
Washington and the secret instruction of Congress throw light on 
the policy which governed the Aniencan authorities. To Congress 
the American officers in confinement appealed in 1779. and Colonel 
Webb was appointed by them to present the memorial. As a pre- 
liminary step he, by permission, visited General Washington at his 
Headquarters at Middletown, iu February, 1779, and obtained from 
him "a calculation made from the last returns of the Commissary of 
Prisoners,'' as a basis for the exchange. 

It was not, however, until January, 1781, that Colonel Webb 
was finally released. His regimental orders of the 7th February 
express the satisfaction he felt in rejoining his command. On the 
7th of August, 1782, Congress passed an Act, for reforming and 
consolidating the army, to take effect January 1, 1783. On the 
21st of the same month, Washington, from his headquarters at 
Newburgh, issued a general order assembling the Light Infantry 
and embodying their battalions in two regiments. Colonel Webb 
was made a Brig. -Gen. by the general Act of Congress, of Sep- 
tember 30, 1783, which fixed promotions He was one of the 
founders of the General Society of the Cincinnati, and later ac- 
tive in the organization of the New York Branch. On the 20th 
October, 1779, Colonel Webb married Eliza Bancker, daughter of 
Richard Bancker, of New York. This lady died in the spring of 
1782. 

After the war he lived for some years in the city of New York. 



103 

He appears in the New York City Directory of 1786, as residing at 
4 Dock, now Pearl Street, the most fashionable quarter of the city. 
His name is entered as " gentleman." Inheriting a large fortune 
from his father he followed no occupation, as this term implies. 
In 1790 he married his second wife, Catharine, youngest daughter 
of Judge Hogeboom, of Claverack, and Hillitjie Midler his wife. 
The Judge was descended from one of the old grantees of the 
Rensselaer Manor. 

The Webb house at Wethersfield, a view of which is here 
given, is still standing. It was the common resting place for 
American officers and gentlemen of distinction on their passage 
through Connecticut, and was known among them, from the gen- 
erous courtesy of its occupants, as "Hospitality Hall." Its chief 
interest to the historical student is derived from its having been 
the spot selected for the conferences held between Washington 
and Rochambeau. There are numerous accounts of these two in- 
terviews which took place on the 20th September, 1780, and the 
21st May, 1781 — at the latter of which the plan of campaign, 
which opened with the operations before New York, and ended 
with the capitualation of Yorktown, was concerted. 

The family manuscripts from which many of the details of this 
sketch have been taken, abound in testimony to the esteem and 
friendship in which Col. Webb was held by his companions in arms. 
He was on intimate terms with the beaux esprits of the army, who 
held the character of the American service as high for courtesy in 
the camp as for gallantry in the field. These intimacies he main- 
tained to the end of his life. He died at Claverack, N. Y., Decem- 
ber 3d, 1807. Of his children by his second wife, the Hon. James 
Watson Webb is best known. In his youth he was a Lieutenant in 
the 3d U. S. Artillery, and has since represented the United States 
as Minister to Brazil ; his son. Gen. Alexander S. Webb, late of 
the United States army, did efficient and gallant service' in the 
civil war, and is now the President of the College of New York.

Among the letters of my father, which follow below, it must 
be borne in mind that some of them were written when he was a 
mere boy of sixteen, and are published both to show the bent of 
his mind at this early age and because they indicate so plainly 
that affectionate disposition which (as his contemporaries have 
informed me) so endeared him to all with whom he came in con- 
tact. 

Your grandfather was a man of unusually good judgment and 
possessed, in a rare degree, the power of inspiring confidence. 
The hundreds of letters now in the possession of the family am- 
ply prove this. He is addressed by men his seniors in age and 
rank in a tone of affectionate esteem, which speaks volumes for 
the precocity of his character and the intellectual status he en- 
joyed in the army — whither circumstances had called some of the 
best minds of the day. The first striking example we have of 
this is the plan (referred to in the extract from the Historical 
Magazine) submitted to General Putnam for the cutting off of 
provisions from the enemy's vessels. This plan was adopted and 
proved successful. 

After your grandfather's letters I publish a few letters re- 
lating to the early part of the war, or containing points of special 
interest, and then pass on to the miscellaneous collection of letters 
found among his papers. 

The numerous pieces of verse, I have printed in a mass, as I 
have his family letters and dinner invitations. Tliese latter will 
be found to be of great interest to his descendants, as showing the 
terms of intimacy on which he stood with the well-known char- 
acters of the day. 



Miscellaneous Letters of General Samuel B. Wedb.

No. 1. 

Teak Sister : — 1 have since I last wrote you passed a very 
disagreeable week at New London. I keep at the Coffee House, 
tho' repeated invitations to lodge at y® Cott'e. 1 returned last 
Tuesday Evening. My first enquiry was to know if there was any 
letters for me from Boston and was much disappointed to find none.

Last evening Mr. Joyce from Wethersfield bro't me your letter dated 
April 22. Where it had been so long I cannot imagine. 

After attending church this day I mounted my horse and came 
to Wethersfield ab't dusk and am now sitting with my brother. He 
has sent a servant to Hartford for your letter. When he returns I 
flatter myself I shall have the pleasure of receiving a l&amp;rge package 
from you. Till then, I'll turn the subject. ' ^ 

Now, my dear Sally, if ever, this is the season to be m the coun- 
try. It's impossible for you to form a true idea of beautiful 
Spring. Never has it been known for twenty years back, the 
spring to be so forward. All nature is in full glory. I want words 
to tell you what I think. Surely you have not forgot the beautiful 
meadows at Middletown. I came thro' there this evening just as 
bright Phoebus was taking his nightly leave of us. I stop'd short 
my horse and for many minutes sat musing on the goodness of the 
Almighty. How beautiful all the fields looked I The tender grass 
shooting upwards for the use of y^ beasts, and fruits of various 
kinds for man's refreshment. There was y^ apple, y^ i)each,y« 
pear, and y'' apricot full of blossoms, giving us warning what in due 
time they will bring forth; and altho' you are not here to see the 
present appearance, you undoubtedly will be to reap some of y^ fruit 
from these blossoms. No more till y® servant returns from Hart- 
ford. 

Monday Morn. — I intended last night to have finished my 
letter, but soon after I wrote the above Sister Libby who was going 
to bed in the opposite chamber, ran in to her brother in a surprise 
and told us there was a fire in the garden. We instantly ran down 
and found y« smoke house had caught fire. Lucky it was we 
found it before we went to bed, otherwise my dear sister, in all 
probability both houses must have been consumed. Thanks to our 
God for his protection. I was very much chagrined and disap- 
pointed when I found neither you nor Hettie had said a word to 
me. I was almost tempted to commit the above scrawl to the 
flames, but upon the whole thought it would not be brotherly. 

Joe calls and says he must send the letters immediately to 
Hartford or the post will begone, and Hetty will (perhaps) thiuk 
I have not rec'd a very long letter from her if I do not answer it. 

My best respects to all the ladies, especially to M'ss H d, as I 

fancy I am most acquainted with her. I know not how many errors 



105 

there are in this letter, nor have I time to look over it, but must let 
it go and doubt not you will correct errors yourself. I am dear 
Sally, your friend and very affectionate brother

My Ever Dear Sister : — Is it possible, can it be, that I am &lt;&gt; ^^rdt* "^o 
going to leave my native shore — that I am not to see nor hear from 
you this winter ? It is and must be so, Hetty ! I have rec'd a letter 
from you since I have been here. 'Twas pleasing to me. Would 
now write each of my sisters a letter, but time will not admit. It 
is now almost a week since I have been here with my horses on 
board ready to put to sea. But the winds have been contrary, &amp; 
the old seamen have not liked the looks of the weather. This even- 
ing the wind is shifted to northwest, and no doubt we shall put to 
sea in the morning ; 3 or 4 days sickness is what is expected when 
I first go out. Happy shall I think myself if no other sickness 
attends me than sea sickness. Hapjiy, did I say? That's impossi- 
ble when I'm absent from my dear Brothers and Sisters. 

I have altered my voyage and shall sail direct for Kingstown in 
Jamaica. If either of you should hear of any vessel that was bound 
there within three weeks from this or to Cape Nicholas Mole, I bog 
you'll not forget your Brother. 

Adieu, My Dear, Dear Sister, 
Blessings attend you prays your affectionate Brother, 

Sam'l B. Webb, 

Monday Morn., 14th Dec'r : — No wind. It looks more like 
May than Dec'r. 

I am overwhelmed with a very feeling and tender melancholy 
to think of going off. We must part ; so our adverse fate compels, 
&amp; God only knows whether we ever meet again. This is necessarily 
precarious from the utter uncertainty of life. All ages are liable to 
the arrest of death, and when the thread of life is spun to its utmost 
length, how short even then is the space from the cradle to the 
grave. 'Tis a solemn certainty that every breast now warm with 
hope, or busy with design, will shortly lie cold and inanimate in the 
grave. The eye that reads this will be closed in death, and the 



106 

hand that writes it will crumble iuto dust. Oh, my sister, consider 
this as dictated by the ties of nature, &amp; inspired by the affectionate 
regard I bear you. Let me confine you to live mindful of, &amp; with 
a wise reference to the important future realities of Death, Judg- 
ment and Eternity. Let us, my dear sisters, live in such manner 
that we may glide serenely thro' the vale of Life without the gloom 
of terror or trepidation of doubt, meet our fate cheerfully and quit 
the stage like those who neither wish to live or fear to die, that the 
survivors of us may mourn the others' loss, yet may have this reflec- 
tion to console us, that our separation, tho' iMinful, is but momen- 
tary, while our reunion in the realms of bliss will prove eternal. 
Eemember what Dr. Parnell tells us: 

'■ Absent or dead, still let a friend be dear, 
A sigh the absent claim; the dead a tear." 

Y'rs, S. B. Webb. 

N. B. — I mean to say more or less to yon every day till I sail. 
At present I feel in a sensitive, melancholy mood, &amp; am now going 
to amuse myself by walking ******* 

Dear Sisters: — It is not half an hour since I wrote y^ above. 
My Captain calls. Says there is a fair wind and we must make sail 
immediately. This I write you from on board my vessel, the 
schooner Bolpliin, Capt. Sam'l Crowell, commander. 

Adieu, my dear Sisters; May Heav'n l:)less and preserve you 
prays your affec. Brother, 

Sam'l B. Webb.

Several very pressing invitations from Mr. Pease, a little business,

of going there this fall ; but in all probability she is, or will before 
my arrival there, have embarked for Carolina. Should that be the 
case,' it will prevent talk. I should leave my visiting Providence 
^ iHid Newport till my return, but as our sister Abby will be with 
me, I think, so young as she is, it would not be worth hei while to go 
that way, thow^ as Joe is now agoing to enter into a state which 
will naturally make him more confined, I shall think it my duty, 
and surely my inclination, to pay my utmost attention to my'two 
remaining |isters. May they be as well situatetl as you are ray ds^r

Sunday Evening, 8 o'clock. 

My Dear Sister: — I sent the servant this afteruidon, while O/ 
■ J,tf^ people were in meeting, in order that he might return seasonably 
^^^ for us to answer our letters, if any, this evening. I have been very 
impatiently waiting an hour or two his return ; nor can I imagine 
what detains him, and fearing I may not have time after his re- 
turn, I shall devote a few of the present moments to you and though 
I justly might scold you for not writing, yet I forbear. 

Half past eight o'clock. The post himself came in while writ- 
ing y^ above, but I am to say only one letter for Joe for myself. I 
am used to being disappointed, I may almost say, every Sunday eve- 
ning, by having no letters from my friends in Boston. But poor 
Hetty! she looks as tho' she had lost all her friends ; says 'tis cruel ; 
says you cannot imagine how it grieves her. I beg of you, my sis- 
ter, not to neglect her. 

And Peggy, too ; she says: " Could she neglect me? No ; I am 
certain the Post has lost my letter," She would have wrote you and 



108 

her much lov'd friend Miss Simpson last week, but her health pre- 
vented, which I informed our SJfeter Peggy of by a Billet per post, 
agreeable to the desire of Hetty, which I suppose she has received. 
Much company is with us, and I must leave writing you. The 
post lodges here. If time, will say something to Mr. Simpson and 
add to this before he goes in the morning. My best respects to our 
good Sister, your companion, and to B'r -Tack. Believe me, my 
Dear Sister, Ever y'r friend 

&amp; most afEec. B'r,

Brother Jack : — You do not deserve a letter. You are ia- 
^debted to me almost a quire of paper," and I must insist you balance 
your accfii^t immediately, without delay. 

Yours, &amp;c., 

S. B. Webb. 

ThM t$ cXTLiiJk. Dear Sister : — I began with an intention to write our brother, 

^ L yi/\^ I&amp;3 j-L^ but on second thoi*§iit,-as I cannot write(to/but7one this week, I 

' ' have altered, and shall say a few words to you. I am not in a hu- 

ifc/ mor to write you a long circumstantial letter, most of the week I 

have spent at Middletowh, returned last evening, and am neither 

sick or well_,but rather in a stupid, senseless mood. Mr. Simpson^ 

I xTU. /v'^'''^ ^'■'^^ reaches you, will be on his way here. I cannot but regret 

J Im^i his not waiting on you a*d^ringing] Miss Peggy up with him, as 

ij Mr. Brymer is to accompany him I think it would be very conven- 

/ lent. I had said everything in my power on the subject, but 'twas 

like talking to the wind. Your friends, many of'them, think you 

/ C. • very indifferent about them.— ^hey are continually enquiring when 

you intend paying us a visit. Tis always the case when I write at 

the sam=! table with our lister Hetty. She twitches away my paper 

and has ten thousand questions of no manner of consequence to 

/ ask me, and i* so very good natur^d wheu she gets info one of these 

^ fits that it makes me laugh, and I cannot but humour her, let me 
be ever so much engaged. She calls me " her old man," &amp;c. I 
could wish ever a s a auoh to live as happy.as I no'w do in the com- 
pany and conversation of this our sister— .Khe is indeed a very good 
girl, and seems to put great dependence and] confidence in me, at the

same time 'tis my duty as well as inclination to pay a particular_ 
friendly and brotherly attention to her. Joe is married, and ia ,.^ 
consequence hfs care aucT attention is turned to another^Hetty and 
myself are therefore at present, inseparable. She goes nowhere un- 
less brother Samuel attends her While I was this week at Middle- 
town there was a ball here, Mr.^ r came bowing, and scraping 

begging the company of Miss AVebb^ut no, by no means. Her"* old 
man '^ was gone to Middletown, and to be sure^with a toss of the 
head/ she should not go. I have spun out considerable more than 
Ithoisglat to when I began, smA if it gives^half the satisfaction in 
perusing that it has given me in writing, I am fully paid. A num- 
ber 0? your friends at Middleto^^n enquired particularly after you, 
and desired to be rem»i»be*ied to you. Adieu. My Comp's, &amp;c., 
wait on your good companion and sister. Believe me as ever your 

veni Affectionate B'r and friend, 

Sam"l B. Webb. 

To our brother Wm. I desire to be remembered. 

Wetheksfield, Saturday, March 18, 1775. 

My Dear Sister : — Your last letter to me has been fully an- 
swered, which now lies by me,-and on a second perusal have con- 
cluded not to send it you,-but promise you a perusal of it the first 
time I see you, which I hope may be soon. It alluded particularly ^ 

to what you said to me in regard to my conversation with Parson 
Walter. I wrote it immediately on the' receipt of yours, and no^ 
doubt every line showed the sentiment of my heart — ./Yours&gt;e--^e 
cave me more uneasiness^nd less satisfaction than any evgrreceiv^d 
from you.. I shall say no further on the subjectj;han that I am not 
m the least uneasy for any part of my conversation with the Parson^ _ 
J-WB confident W*«t I have said nor done anything *» deserve^ cen- 
sure. —God knows I had it not in my heart^but to treat him with 
rt»e respect due him. _If plain honesty is capable of giving 
offence,-! shall I fear be often blamed by this censorious world— Be 
that as it mayri will/ while I have life,-speak 'the sentiments (/f I 
say anything) &amp; dictates of an h ones t heart to ^Iax, Womax and 
Child. Assured of this in my own breast,-! shall Endeavor not to

tion is such that we are debarred the pleasure of seeing each 5ther,^ a/u,c\^ 
oa^ ^Vtn ffx- ^ A/little social conversation in the epistolary way adds BHi9li--t?5'The / 
(jt\^\n,.eL f) TMononrc when now and then an opportunity ofiers in which we can 

write more freely. Miss , w^o« I fell in company with this 

morning at breakfast, has very politely offered to convey a letter im- 
mediately to your hands. So good an opportunity I could not let 
pass without acquainting you of my an'S your other friends being in 
a state of health which renders them happy.— Joe and his lady live 
At" i« the old "Mansion House as happy as heart can wish. Hetty ■(t»4 V- 

Abbey are their companions. A few families which are genteel and 
A./ cl^er make up an agreeable circle. I spent five months with them, 
which I shall count among tne number of my h*ppy days — Hetty 
and myself used frequently to ramble where our sister Sally had been 
before and with us, much we wished for her good company, Hetty 
says she should be as happy as this world could make her, if her sister 
and friend (Peggy) was with her. They, I have reason to suppose, 
would be equally pleased in her comp'y. Whose fault has it been 
that they are not altogether, now "at Wethersfield ? This I leave 
with you to answer. This I can with truth say — no pains on my 
part have been wanting — witness my former letters when at Cam- 
bridge, /x^ 

Busy imagination yet paints to me a future day wken we shall 
meet and spend many social, friendly hours together. Be it so. I 
wish it most fervently. Of this be assured — that the Sous of Amer- 
ica will reign Masters of the Land wbich God gave them. The 
combined powers of Europe can only distress, not conquer her free 
born sons. Of this I trust Britain is, or soon will^ convinced, But '''^ / 
I musTstop my pen ; it leads me to a subject which I did not intend 
to mention. Rest easy, my friend and sister, on my account, _/!; is ^ 
^the cause of virtue j^ country and the rights of man, I am en- 
gaged in, and~He-^ho ever has in the greatest dangers preserved me 
can contma^is protection. If I fall, it shall be gloriously. Ee- 
meoife^rine with the warmestaffection to Mr. Jack, Miss Peggy and 
friends if such there are'who may enquire after your friend

y Deak Jack :— I wrote my sister a few clays since by a youug CL T'Cf^Co yS 

lady from this place, which I doubt not she has ere this received. 

Y I have now the satisfaction to acquaint you. your many friends in 

this state are in high health and spirits. The bearer, Lieut. Fan- 

ning'(a prisoner who is now returning to his confinement) is a very 

honest, clever lad — any civilities shown him will be doing that which 

will oblige me. I would wish, my friend, to speak to you in the old 

— ' familiar way, but it must not be at present. Love,_ esteem, &amp;c., has 

' in no degree varied from what it formerly was for yoil, my good sis- 

^ tei', ft«d m^- worthy friend Peggy . Assure them of it a«4 tell them 4r~

Tell our old friend Siierry my compliments await him — ««4- ^

Sir : — During our captivity and residence on this Island we are &gt; 

happy in having received, and are willing to acknowledge, the polit- 
est treatment from the Gentlemen of the British Army. It fre- 
quently has been otherways with ill-natured Refugees and Inhabi- 
tants of illiberal sentiments. These we have ever tho't beneath our 
notice. An instance has now arisen however which I am now 
obliged to communicate to you, of an officer under your immediate 
command, deviating from the character of a Gentleman in a way 
which I am confident will not be justified by yen. 

Capt. Drakeford, of the 2Gth, last evening came to the Quarters 
of a Mr. Helm, Lt. in the American Army, a prisoner of war now 
on his Parole, and without theieast provocation insulted him with 
the most abusive language, after which, in a most ungcntleniaulike 
manner, forced the cockadefrom his hat, collared and pushed him 
from the stoop on which he was standing. Mr. Helm's situation 
prevented his retaliating either Ijy word or action, thinking it a more 



118 

proper way to obtain satisfaction by laying the matter before his su- 
periors. At his particular request I have taken the liberty of writ- 
ing you on the subject. 

"With due Respect I am sir, 

Yours &amp;c., &amp;c.,

»' hist after a warm, disagreeable ride, and found our friends in a state 
of Health, but the whole Country in an uproar. The enemy, about 
;i,000 under the infamous Governor Tryon, have been at New Haven. 
They took possession of the Town on Monday last, there being only 

about 100_of the militia to oppose theny /^ The young men of the /UTU^.-

/ Toivii and the Collegians behaved gallantly, and fought them as long 

*^ ^ as it could be of service. In the action we lost about 20 of that 

number. On Tuesday they embarked, after plundering the Town 
and burning a few stores, went over to East Haven and burnt all 
the Buildings next the shore. From this they took shipjiing and 
went for Fairfield, where they landed^ a»4 took jiossession without ^ 
opposition, the militia being dismissed after the Enemy embarked 
at New Haven, inider an Idea that they had returned to N. York — 
and the Harvest suffering. At 12 o'clock Thursday night they sent 
a Flag to the Inhabitants who had collected on the Heights out of 
Town, acquainting them if they would come in, give up their arm?, 
swear allegiance to George the Third, the Town should be preserved. 
Thev returned for answer that the Town was but a secondary object, 
and that they should never submit to the Government of Britain's 
Tyrant. The Enemy went immediately to plundering, and at seven 
o'clock set fire to the Town which now remains a heap of rujdbish. / / 
This Village was large and as beautiful as any in this State. Tlie ' 
buildings large and elegant. To add to the misfortune, the Inhab- 
itants had not time to remove any of their property, so that many 
reputable wortliy famihes are reduced from a ^tate of affluence to 
Poverty. Thus are these wretches, the Servants and Slaves of 
George the Third, burning defenceless Towns and wagging War ^/ 
^ against innocent Women aaxl Children— a Child of three years old 
was taken from the arms of its mother and thrown into the flames, 
and the mother, to stop her shrieks, knocked down with a musket. 
A man who was taken prison'er, being an old Countryman, was rolled 
in a sheet bound fast, the sheet wet With rum and set fire to. In 
this situation, just before he expired, our people found him. Sev- 
eral negro servants, who were left to take care of their master's 
property, were burnt alive for attempting to extinguish fhe fire. 
Indeed, my friend, this last excursion of theirs has been marked 
with more savage cruelty than before known, for which, may God 
reward them. I am happy to tell you it has had a very good effect 
on the people, the Tory and Timid AVhig now join in determining 
to take arms with their Virtuous Countrymen and swear revenge. 
I have lilver seen the people so universally ready to take the Field 
since the Lexington Battle. This morning an express informs that 
4,000 of the Enemy have marched from Kingsbridge and had got as 
far as Horseneck. The fleet under Tryon with 3,000 »« still in the

sound, so that it appears they are determined to burn all our Sea 

coasts. The militia far and near are under marching orders, and 

wait but the signal to move. Two Brigades of Continentals are on , 

'5/ the march from Hudsor^ river ; I wish they may have it in their 

power- to meet the British. They give out they intend to penetrate 

into the Heart of this State ; I wish most fervently they would 

attempt it, but I rather fear they will not go far from their shiidping. 

Let me hear from you respecting Penobscott. I intend in a day or 

two to proceed to Head Quarters; my absence from this will not be 

long ; on my return you shall hear from me. My love is with 

Martha and Abby and your little ones — something of the same 

nature hovers about Ten-Hills. Kiss them all for your friend a*^ 

very affectionate Brother,

Providence, Tuesday Morning, 6th July, 17T9. 2. nr€Co So 

Dear Brother : — I congratulate you on the arrival of a large 
ami valuable prize ship, laden with provisions and goods, at New 
London, taken, 'tis said, by the Kevenge and the two little privateers, 
the Washington and Gates. This I think will more than clear the 
first cost of our shares, and I wish they may be further successful. 
I set o^from this in half an hour and intend reaching Wethersfield 
on Thursday evening or Friday morning, from whence you may 
again hear from me. The Philadelphia paper of the 23d ulto. 
confirms the account of the defeat of the British before Charlestown. 
A gentleman is arrived there who was in the action, amt says when *" 
he left they were nearly surrounded, about ten miles from the town. 
'Tis unaccountable we have no regular express from that quartlr. 

General Washington has ordered Glover's Brigade from this to 
^/ join him on Hudson river with all possible dispatch, -->m*H seems con- 
fident the enemy mean to attack him.

Did you kiss the ten Hills' lasses for me as you promised ? Did 
you double it'with my favorite ? Sweet girl, I wish I was there to 
take that duty off your hands. '

promise that I would frequently write you, 'Tis not for want of 
inclination that there has been so long a period in which you have 
not heard from me. I was at home but a few days before my busi- 
ness required my attention at headrjuarters, from which I returned 
yesterday efening much fatigueTl and yet uncertain when I may call 
myself a freeman. However, my present prospects are such that I 
live in hopes it will be speedy. When that happy hour arrives 'tis 
more than probable you may see me in Boston, and if nothing hap- 
pens more than I now kuow I shall take Hetty with me.

Curious movements in this world. Mr. Early suffered the priest 
at Hartford tcTtell his people that he intended marriage with the 
Widf Church. It surprijed us all. You, we are" told, are equally 
surprised with a manoeuvre at Ten-Hills. This is a strange world 
we live in. I for mv part wish them much fun together, but am 
sorry for our friend Bob. I think he must be unliappy. Remember 
me to them all. 
f I was one night at our friend, Doct'r Johnson's, on my return. 

Found the family as usual. Much in quirisig about you. Sally says ^/ 
she intends paying you a visit some time in the Fall. They have ^ 
\ been very unhappy with the insults of the jZfommou people, but the 
J. j&gt;^»i Doct'r has at last taken the oath of allegiance to the United States, 
Qfi\ ^ and people of all ranks seem pleased with it. I presume if he acts 
^ with decision he will soon be in great favor, and indeed is a most 

I amiable member of society. 

Have you seen Maj'r Harnage since I left you ? I am sorry I 
CajUL in^^/ had not time to ■tell him before I left Boston. Should you see him,

WoKCESTER, Monday Evening, 
Jan'y 24, 1780. 

My Deak Bk. : — We arrived here about six this eveni ng from 
Learned's at Watertown, we lodged last night, occasioned by our 
horses falling into Cambridge Eiver, the particulars of which no 
doubt you are acquainted with as Erskine and Livingston were both 
with us. I think it fortunate I saved my horses. 

The extreme cold has made this day's ride very disagreeable. 
The roads some part of the way are tolerable, others wretched indeed. 
My horses were worried more than the whole jaunt down. However 
I intend being at Wethersfield by Thursday noon, perhaps sooner. 

The happy hours we liave pass'd at your house made us all dull 
at parting. We feel sensibly your great attention while in town, 
and wish by more than words to convince you how ready we shall be 
on all occasions to acknowledge your goodness. 

My hurry made me forget to send to the whitesmith for that 
instrument he made ; the scoundrel promised to send it up. How- 
ever as it is a matter of much importance I must beg you will get it 
and forward it carefully bound up by the first conveyance. The 
price is four hard dollars which I'll forwardjyou the first opportu- 
nity. Let me beg you not to forget it. 

I could wish Mr. Otis to enclose me the keys of the Canteen in 
a letter, as it may not be safe to have them come together.

Jack and I have been complaining the whole day and but now 
have found the cause. Being so accustomed to drink a large pro- 
portion of wine every afternoon, it's become absolutely necessary 
we should bi'eak off by degrees, otherwise a weakness of the nerves, 
a headache, and a number of &amp;c.'s, &amp;c.'s, &amp;c.'s will follow, there- 
fore we have ordered Otis' cork drawn. * * * 

Well, half an hour is gone and in that time three bumpers 
each — our nervous complaint quite gone, even without the inward 
or outward application of a drop of Gin. Our toast was to Otis, 
to whom we are indebted for the Good Creature ; another to our 
Boston friends in general, and the third to one of the dear little 
girls which nearly stole my heart. Who is it but the lady with 
whom you and I drank tea, and heard an enchanting tune on the 
harpsichord accompanied with the voice. The idea alone makes 
my heart bound and go Pitta, Patta — the song was not unlike 
The Knife. Oh, Barrell, if you see that dear little girl, at least 
kiss her once in my name, and say for me all that your lively imag- 
ination could suppose I should say for myself was I present. 
Faith, I think it a fortunate circumstance I left town so soon. 
Come, Jack, fill the other Bumj)er and give us a lady — Five to 
one, the Rope walk. Well, upon my word, I've won the bet ; but 

Q)(/v^ Jack swears he's not in earnest. Well, my friend, by this time I

^ - My Dear Br. — Number 53 was from the North Branch 
of Raritan the 39th of October which I hope is with you. I am 
sorry again to repeat I have received but one letter from you 
since I left home. It makes me uneasy. It looks too like forget- 
fulness. Every opportunity I have had has been improved. You 
certainly can get letters on to the army so that I know not what 
excuse to make. 

I wrote the Baron Steuben at Philadelphia to leave the balanci- 
due you in the hands of Mr. Seagrove or Mr. Erskine, but I am ap- 
prehensive my letter did not reach him before he set out for the

I had not since leaving Wetherstield, heard anything of you. Yes, 
Barrel!, I am among the list of old folk?, a married man ; and be as- 
sured, I only regret that so many days and years have been spent with- 
out knowing the happiest state this world affords; and I have every 
reason to hope it will continue while life lasts. That I am a soldier 
is in the eyes of some of my friends a misfortune, because I may the 
^ / sooner quit th;^ stage. "Tis a misfortune in my own eyes, but in 
two cases wt^y, one that my country should require men of the pro- 
fession, and the other that f"am debarred the domestic ease antl 
comfort wliich otherways I might enjoy. But I liope to live throegii / 
all the troubles of the war, and yet partake of many a social glass 
with yoUi^ - = 

^:^our new sister is fond of you and Sally, though unknown. 1 
flatter mysalf you will one day or other be equally fond of her ; she 
begs me to tender you both her jove «mL compliments. A fond ^ 
mother, and she the only child, is all that pi'Svented my taking her ^/ 
toWethersfield (and perhaps to Boston) this winter. I should de- 
lay it no longer than the next Spring, but then my duty will call 
me to thejield. I hope it may be the last campaign, and a very ^r ji 
honorable^ne to America. ^The certificate which you favored me "^ 
with finally has affected my exchange. You, therefore, again have 
*- my warmest thanks, a»4 tBrongb; yo-a I beg to tender them to 
others, my friends, the owners of the late Vengeance Privateer — 
Atick to your promise — keep a bottle of satisfaction for your new ' 
sister (this has some self in it). T"shall have a share, and unless the 
fortune of war disable me, it shall be the next winter. But should 
it be my unfortunate lot to add to the numbei^who have fallen in 
their country's cause, you may then drink it to my memory ; for 
even in'death I hope to do honoj^r to my friends. 

Hetty has wrote Sally ; this will answer as well for her as for 
you. Tell her I love her most heartily, and wish both you and her 
every felicity in this world and that which is to come. ^^r»tl*#» JZZZ* 
Jack leaves us this diiy. He will take charge of our letters, and

^=^ ^=^ Camp at Peekskill, 

Wednesday, June 27, 1781. 

My Dear Br :— Your letter of the 18 inst. Br. Jack sent me 
yesterday. I have wrote you several times on the subject you 
mention and have now enclosed a letter calculated for you to shew 
the Governor which I earnestly entreat you will as soon as possi- 
ble. 

Mrs. Bancker can go on by the way of Elizabeth Town which 
will save a great deal of trouble; besides, I am sure it would not 
be agreeable to Gen'l Washington to have any flags passing on this 
side at present, but from the Jersey side there will be no diffi- 
culty. 

Doct'r Cockran left the Earitan on Saturday last, when he 
called to see Mrs. Webb and found her yet in a low state of 
health; so much so that she is most of the time confined to her 
bed, but has had no return of raising blood since I left her. I 



131 

flatter myself, with jiroper care, she will 'ere Ions regain her 
health — Hetty and the rest of the family were well — Brother Jack' 
has been disappointed about going after her, on acc't of our tak- 
ing the Field. It is fortunate on acc't of Betsey's illness and 1 
am truly sorry her friends at Wethersfield should be so very ur- 
gent for her coming home this season — However, as it is, Br. .Jack 
will take the earliest opportunity to conduct her home. As for 
me, it will be out of my power, till the campaign is over, to leave 
my Reg't, as Major Wyllys is with the Marquis and Lieut. -Col. 
Huntington has this morning been detached to serve with Col. 
Scammel on the Lines, and probably will be absent most of the 
season. This, however, gives me no pain — I can do as well with- 
out as with him. 

At the close of the campaign, my present intention is, if Mrs. 
Webb's health will permit, to see you at Wethersfield and possibly 
pass the winter there with you. 

I have wrote you on several subjects since I left you, which 
you have not noticed. It would add much to the pleasure I take 
in writing if I could obtain answers — You have twice acknowl- 
edged the receipt of my letters and given no answers to many re- 
quests they have contained — If you have leisure I'll thank you to 
look them over when you next write. 

I have enclosed, for the perusal of you, Chester and other 
friends, the present order of Battle — You can show it to those you 
think proper, and will readily see the impropriety of giving out 
any copies. 

Our march towards Kingsbridge depends on a number of cir- 
cumstances — We are at present destitute of every necessary but 
provision — The Q'r Master's department cannot furnish horses to 
move a single Brigade; besides this, our present numbers will not 
justify our taking a critical position — Connecticut, 'tis universally 
said, for two years past has done nothing at all — Her supplies 
have been trifling — her promises great — and her exertions a Puff. 
Of this our present weakness in men is a shameful proof, and 1 
am sorry to say that they are now taking every step in their pow- 
er to cause a total dissolution of the Line. 

The Committee have returned, and was the Assembly's con- 
duct known, I should dread the consequences — Everything, at 
present, is quiet — The Committee have laid their report before 



132 

General Parsons, he, before the Commander-in-Chief, and meas- 
ures are taking bj them that the Line mav not know the present 
prospects respecting their pay, &amp;c., tintil some steps are taken to 
shew the State the follj thev are ranning into — Heaven smiles on 
us and holds our Freedom and Peace while our Country is doing 
(seemingly) eTerything in its power to bring eternal infamy and 
disgrace on themselres and us. 

On this you may rely — If the present moment is not taken to 
do justice to those who are sacrificing their all in the cause of 
justice, steps will he taken which wiU be truly alarming — Without 
aggravation I do assure you, when the verdict of our Assembly is 
known, I fear a general mutiny — All is kept secret yet, in hopes 
General Washington will take the matter up, and get a new As- 
sembly call'd. 

Time will not permit my being more particular on this sub- 
ject. I intended writing my sister, your other self, but cannot at 
present: yet I hope to hear from her when a good conveyance 
offers. 

Present my love to her and Abby and the two little prattlers 
— Remember me to Chester and the good people of his family &amp; 
be assured I am affectionately. 

Your friend and Brother, 

Sam'l B. Webb. 

If convenient 1 wish you to purchase me half a quintal of 
Good Codfish.

ZS'oETH Braxch, Eaeitax, 

5 Oct'r, 1781. 

My Deae Beotheb : — This day twelve months I supposed 

yself one of the happiest men in life. I flattered myself with 

uture peace, domestic ease, and happiness for many years to 

come ; but, alas! I fear my most pleasing hopes are soon, very 

soon, to be at an end. 

I returned last evening from Philadelphia with a flag of truce 
to take my sick friend, Mrs. Bancker, Sister Hetty and Mis; 
Duyckink to Wethersfield by water, and have this day sent for a 
flag for tb" Tame purpose out of Xew York, having previous to my 



133 

r 

late journey had assurances from General Roberson the flag should 
be granted ; but Mrs. Webb has declined so very fast of late, that 
I fear it is too late even for the sail and change of air to restore 
her to health. 

While life remains there is room for hope, and both duty and 
inclination lead me to take every step which may be beneficial . 
The vessel is ready, and if I can get the permit from Xew York, 
and Betsy's health will permit, in ten or fifteen days they will em- 
bark for Wethersfield I have requested leave to accompany the 
flag. If gratified, or otherways, the day vre are ready to sail I 
shall dispatch a boy with my horses by land. 

I shall write Mr. Deane by this conveyance, and sincerely .•'^^'■Vt^ii.Crn^rJ 
hope he will not refuse the House, with such furniture as he will 
not want himself — such as can be transported will be taken with 
us. 

Remember, my Br., that my whole winter supplies depend on 
you. ' lis needless to name particulars when I tell you nothing 
can be carried in by the flag, and when you must be a better judge 
than myself. 

Hetty has had a severe fever but is again able to walk about. 
The intended sail will, I think be beneficial to her. 

There is a report that General Greene has had a very severe 
action in South Carolina, in which he gained a very signal victory 
over the main body of the enemy, but as this wants confirmation, 
I shall not even name the particulars further than that 'tis said 
Colo. Washington and every officer of his Reg't, save one, is 
killed or wounded, and that but twelve of his men remain unhurt. 

I shall write you again by the lad who takes on my horses. 

Remember me affectionately to all our friends, and be assured 
of the sincerest affection of 

Yt Friend and Br., 

Sam'l B. Webb. 

October 6th. — Mrs. Webb is so ill this morning and continues 
to grow weak so fast, that at times I am apprehensive she never 
will be able to move from this. However, I cannot but hope a 
few days will make her better.

No 30. 

Wethersfield, Jan'y 4, 1782. 

Dear Barrell; — Believe me, my friend and Brother, when 
I tell you your letter of sympathy and advice which has been with 
e some time has afforded me hours of consolation. The very 
tender and affectionate manner in which you mention my Dear 
Departed Eliza, and your ardent wishes for this afflicting stroke of 
Providence being properly sanctified to us, merit and receive our 
warmest thanks. But the glorious idea you have given me of 
again meeting the idol of my soul in the realms of bliss has 
affoided me more real consolation and happy reflections than any 
other circumstance since her bidding me a last adieu. Tis that 
which has given me pleasing ideas of Death and a glorious im- 
mortality, and if I know my own soul he would be a welcome mes- 
senger this very hour, provided I am properly fitted for those 
rewards iu Heaven which I am confident my dear partner will re- 



135 

ceive. This world truly appears a mighty void, nor have I the 
least relish for its greatest enjoyments. Time, no doubt, will 
soften my affliction, otherwise nature could not support the 
shock ; but to Forget my dear Eliza is as impossible as it is for me 
ever to enjoy her company here on earth again, nor would I wish 
it. Her life and conduct was such as to give the most pleasing 
recollections. Her mind and soul were too great and good to be 
confined to this scene of trouble and misery ; 'tis therefore, I 
trust, our Heavenly Father summoned her attendance to receive 
the rewards due to the good and virtuous. We therefore ought 
to acquiesce in full confidence in her eternal gain, but also more 
hard the task. Time, and that only, must soften our affliction, 
and with patience and resignation we must wait that happy, 
happy period when we shall have a pleasing reunion with our dear 
departed friend in the Heavenly mansions of Bliss, never again to 
be separated. I could dwell hours on the subject, but it only 
awakens my grief anew, and will, to a soul of your sensibility, be 
distressing. A day ere long will come, I hope, when I may sit 
down with you, when, in the bosom of friendship, it will be pleas- 
ing to relate my misfortunes and laud the innumerable virtues of 
my dear Eliza. 

Mrs. Bancker and her sister beg me to thank you sincerely 
for the affectionate manner in which you mention them. They 
both look forward to the satisfaction of a personal acquaintance 
with you and my dear sister, to whom tender my warmest love. I 
should write her but hear she has just presented you with another 
fine daughter, on which pleasing fact I heartily congratulate you 
both. That you may both spend many happy days of domestic 
felicity, and live to see your dear little ones introduced properly 
into life, is my fervent prayer. 

Mrs. Gary and my Eliza from infancy were strongly connected 
by the ties of friendship. From that circumstance (if no other) 
Mrs. Bancker has a great love for her. Gary promised to bring 
her up, but I suppose the want of snow prevents. I wish it, as T 
think her company would be a consolation to Mrs B. Should 
this take place I shall endeavor to persuade the latter to return 
with her to Boston ; a ride and variety will certainly be of service 
to her. I shall in this case accompany her, and of course pass a 



136 

few days at your mansion, where I am sure I shall find as much 
friendship and hospitality as anywhere in life. 

I should have wrote you before but my mind has not been in 
a situation to permit it. Let me hear from you frequently, and 
be assured that I am rery sincerely 

Your friend and very 

Affectionate Brother, 

Sam'l B. Webb. 

P. S. Eleven o'clock at night.— Colo and Mrs. Gary arrived 
here about two hours past. Our sleighing is quite gone. If it 
should be good again soon, I know not but I may have the pleas- 
ure of seeing you. Adieu.

Wethersfield, 

Sunday Morning, Aug. 4, 1782. 

My Dear Brother: — I have long intended to devote a leisure 
hour or two to you in answering your several friendly epistles, but 
want of conveyance at one time and leisure at others has deprived 
me of that pleasure, and sorry I am now to tell you this will only be 
an apology for a letter. Mr. Craik the bearer (son to the physician 
general of the army) sets out immediately for Boston. He has been in 
a bad state of health and is travelling to the eastward in hopes of 
reaping benefit from the change of air. For the sake of his good 
father as well as on his own account, I will thank you to notice the 
youth whOe in Boston. 

I have bsen home about and set out again to-morrow morning 
for camp. My health in the former part of the summer was much 
impaired, but at present think myself much better. While in camp 
I was a member of a general Court Martial for a trial of Major-Gen- 
eral McDougall from the 15 th of April until the 22nd of July. I 
mention this by way of ap3logy for my long silence and at the same 
time do assure you that in future you shall hear from me more fre- 
quently. 

What the operations of this season will be is yet very uncer- 
tain. The French Army is near at hand and ours is to move down 
to the White Plains this or the next week. If a fleet comes, New 
York will be our object. I hope to be early in winter quarters, when, 



137 

if nothing material happens ,1 intend with Mrs. Bancker to pass a few 
days with you in Boston. 

Poor woman she yet feels very sensibly our too heavy affliction 
and the subject will ever be painful to me, my loss is irreparable nor 
do I ever expect to sie that happiness on Earth I have once experi- 
enced. Tell my good sister Sally I received her letter in camp and 
will the fii'st leisure write her — at present time will not permit. 

Kemember me to Hetty — I think she miglit inform me how her 
health is — I wish much to see you all. Br. Joe is gone with a flag 
into New York. Br. Jack marched three days since for camp. 
The rest of tlie circle desire their love to you all. Mr. Craik's hurry 
obliges me to close, after assuring you that I am with sincerity your 
affectionate Brother 

Sam'l B. Webb. 

I shall be happy to hear from you when your leisure will permii. 
The Jason is safe arrived at New London. Capt. Riley was taken on 
his homeward bound passage and carried into Bermuda from there 
he has returned in a flag.

.^ Deae Bahrell: — I feel disapijointed that I have seen so lit- 

tie of you while in town, and am sorry my business urges my leav- 
ing you so soon; I already have recollected several subjects which 
I wished to have conversed with you upon; they must be deferred 
until we again have the pleasure of seeing you. I have concluded 
to get flve rings made in memory of my once lovely Eliza: one for 
myself, one for her mother, one for her sister, one for her aunt, 
and the other for a female friend, who was intimate with her from ■ 
childhood to death. None of them to be larger than yours, if you 

think it will answer, rather less. Those for myself and Mrs. B 

I wish to have as neat and good as can be made for five or six Guineas 
each. The other three I should suppose might bs made suflicient- 
ly elegant for three or four Guineas each. I am confident no per- 
son has a prettier fancy for designs of this kind than yourself. 
'Tis therefore I take the liberty to request you will, the first 
leisure hours you have, form some proper designs, and forward 



138 

them to me by the first Post. Let them be different. So soon as 
this is done, I must solicit your further assistance in writing to 
your correspondent in England to have them executed in the 
neatest manner, for which purpose I will forward you some Hair. 

We have some old gold which was given my Dear Eliza, such 
as lockets, necklaces, &amp;c., &amp;c. I should prefer its being made use 
of for the rings to any other; they are very ancient, and of no 
use; if you think it will answer I will forward it to you with the 
hair; be so good as to let me hear from you on the subject by the 

first conveyance; very much love attend your circle. Mrs. B 

wishes a friendly remembrance. 

Adieu, and believe me

" ,T--VU.~. 8teubem3*«*. Pres't. So soon as he arrives in Town we presume 

(7i&gt;'"'"' he will call a meeting of our State Society and communicate to 
them the contents. 

In the'meantime, we cannot omit the present opportunity to 
acqnaint your Excellency with the sentiments which the most dis- 
tinguished characters in this Society entertain with regard to your 
desire not to be re-elected President of the General Society, ilany 
of them stand high in your good opinion and all of them are 
warmly attached to you. Their sentiments will pervade this ,^o- i C~ ■ 
ciety, and if regret at so unexpected and unfortunate a circum- 
stance, can give weight to arguments added to those of a sim- 
ilar nature in reply to your circular letter from the different 
States, it is to be hoped you will not decline continuing at the 
head of a Society brought into existence by a glorious event which 
crowned you with never fading laurels. A Society £a«m£d on the TOlA^^. cUxi 
most noble principles, whose highest ambition is to imitate your 
bright example, should not prematurely be deprived of that ray 
which for so many years guided our steps in the paths of honor.

L/ 

Should no internal divisions arise on your retiring, yet, Sir, 
the withdrawing of your patronage will have a most destructive 
effect on our rejiutation abroad. 

You have exhibited the most noble instance of patriotism 
that modern history can relate; you glow with affection for your 
country and must feel interested to promote the honor and dig- 
nity of a patriotic band of warriors, who, like the arrows t/n the l / 
Eagle's talon, will be respected while united to that head who so 
oft displayed them in the field of Glory,,* ^ut, separated, farewell ^ 

the splendor of Columbia's Eagle in European (Z'ourts. At home, 
lukewarmness will take place of the generous zeal which animates 
every member. Our funds, intended for the most laudable purposes, 
may remain unimproved for waut of energy or unanimity, while un- 
heeded flow the Widow's tears, unheard the Orphan's cry/ ^hat i 1 1 
source whence gladness should flow to brighten the face of sorrow 
may be choked up_«^he noble end of our institution Bi aft- W frus-

spirit which inspires your Excellency to so many acts of public 
utility induce you to continue the patron of our infant society whose 
maturer powers shall be one of the many branches to perpetuate the 
veneration due to the savior of his Country. 

These, Sir, are the sentiments of our Society, which we have 
thought it incumbent on us to apprize you of. I have the honor to 
be (for &amp; in behalf of the Standing Committee), Your Excell'y's

New York, 5th May, 1787. 
Deak Brother:— I have received your letter of the 23rd of 
April. By that I should suppose several of my late letters have mis- 
carried. However it's probable they have reached you before this. 
The package from our Brother Jack I gave a gentlemen 6 or 8 
days since. He returned it to me last evening, having concluded 
not to go. I shall now commit it to the care of Doctor Bond of 
Philadelphia, a gentleman of distinction in his profession and an old 
acquaintance of mine. Your attention to him will oblige me.

Major Pierce can give but little information respecting mercan- 
tile matters in Georgia. You must depend on information from 
that quarter from our Brother Jack and Seagrove. Always forward 
your letters to me. We have opportunities at least a month by 

water. 

I have not yet been able to learn anything about the trade at 
Trinidad. I shall make the necessary inquiries and give you person- 
al information. 

To-morrow I go to Jersey and shall be back in about a week. 
Soon after which it is my intention to set off for Wethersfield with 
Aunt Polly. Colonel Gary is yet in St. Croix and Mr. Lowe talks 
of going out to him soon. Of this you shall have further informa- 
tion. He may be terviceable to you respecting Hydes. I sincerely 
lament the old doctor's misfortune in the loss of his son. He is cut 
off in the flower of his age . True 'tis a debt we all must pay, and it 
fairly astonishes me when I look back eight or ten years and find how 
many of my acquaintances have been taken off in the prime of life, 
and at most we cannot remain long, and I seriously hope we may be 
prepared for that important event. 

"Congress are here. Nothing of importance going on. In shoit 
they can do nothing. We are truly in a wretched situation, and a 
total change must (I think) take place before America can be happy 
or respectable. 

The Empress of China, Capt. Green, arrived in port last evening 
after a passage of four months and eighteen days from Canton. 'Tis 
said she has made a great voyage. 

I am now to solicit you will put up three or four barrels of shad 
for myself and several friends that have spoke to me on the subject, as 
the shad taken in the Connecticut River are much superior to those 
caught here — , and for myself half a l)arrel of salmon. 

Please remember me affectionately to Sister Webb and other the

I)£AK 15Aiii!i:Li. : — We were niaile joyfid by last evening's post ^^ ^ cn/^ *0v 
on the news of Connecticut having adoi)ted the new Constitution, ' 

but a dani]mess is thrown over our s])irits by the information rliat 'i- v'rv . 



142 

the convention of Massachusetts are much divided. Should that 
state reject it we are mined. On them depends cveiything. EveiT 
Federal man in this city looks up to your Sta^e for our political sal- 
vation ; for, say they, if Massachusetts, Connecticut and Xew Hamp- 
shire accept it tolerably unanimously, this state dare not refuse ; but, 
on the contrary, should they reject it, the anti-federal Junto here 
will increase and come forward. The fact is that the sense and 
property here are universally in favor. This City is very unanimous, 
but we have, as you have before heard, four or five characters 'N'io- 
lently opposed ; none, however, whose influence is to be feared but 
Governor Clinton's. His has been astonishingly gi-eat in the back 
countries, but is undoubtedly daily lessening. 

The Legislature is now sitting at Poughkeepsie, SO miles up the 
river. "What they will do we arc at a loss to determine. That they 
will appoint a convention we haven't a doubt, but suppose the anti- 
federals will be for delaying its meeting to as distant a period as 
possible. However, as I said before, almost everything depends on 
your state. I wish in your next you would dip a little into this 
subject. Let me know how the convention proceeds and what the 
prospects are. God forbid that Adams should have much influence 
among you. We have in the press a pamphlet written by Col. Ham- 
ilton, under the signature of Publius, on the subject of a Federal 
Government, which I will send you by first conveyance. He is, 
imdoubtedly, one of the most sensible men in America, thoiigh )'et 
not much more than thirty years old. I hold him one of my 
warmest friends, and he possesses my undivided esteem. 

We have no late annvals from Europe, but several ships arc 
daily expected, when we shall probably know whether peace is to 
continue. I think a war in Europe would be advantageous to our 
politics, tho' our commercial regulations are so bad (or rather the 
want of any general regulations) that I am fearful the mercantile 
interest would not be able to take the advantages which would be 
presented to us. 

Present me affectionately to Sally and Hetty, in which Aunt 
Polly joins. 

Y'r Fiiend and Br..

Dear Barkell : — I am favored with yours of tlie 1st inst. and 
shall pay it tlic attention you wish. Mr. Livingston is out of town ; 
the moment he returns 1 will see him. There will be no difBculty 
about exchanging paper for specie, if he will allow the discount, 
which is from to 8 per ct. The moment I can get it, it shall be 
forwarded by Peace or Hyde. 

Your apples were yesterday shipped in the Schooner "Sally,"' 
Benj'n Olmstead, Master. Out of three barrels they are reduced 
to two. Sliould you have occasion for more, they can be procured. 

Our harbor has been filled with ice for ten days past in such a 
nuinner that it has been impossible for vessels to move in safety ; 
and 'tis said that the sound is yet full of ice. so that Olmstead may 
not sail for several days. 

I intended sending you a SKper v.a-dlcnl ])arrel of cider, liut the 
weather is such that the man who promised it has not been in town. 
If he brings it, and \t is such as I wish you to bottle, and make 
•'satisfaction'' of, I will send it by tlic first Vessel ; otherwise j'ou 
will hear no more of it. 

Murray repeatedly promised, and several times afterwards told- 
me, he had wrote you about Geary's business ; and tlie last time I 
called on him he showed me his letter to Fisli wliieh lie siipposcd 
was all that was necessary. 

I congratulate you, and my dear sister, on the arrival to tliis 
troublesome world of my young nephew. I lio])e he may live to be 
a blessing to you both, and do much good in liia day (Did yencration. 
If he follows the steps of his father, he will help to populate the 
wilds of America, and do all he can to please the ladies. 

0, New Hampshire ! you have (perha])s unintentionally) done 
us much injnry. Anti-federalists lift their heads. Had they ad- 
journed only to April, it would not have been much ; but they will 
now be in the rear of several States, which, we fear, will pattern 
after them. This city is true, l»nt the county wants mending; wc 
are busy ; so are the Anti's. 

An Eastern paper says, Capt. was safe at the Cape de 

Verds. Oool lucl&lt;; (o him. My love to all, and believe me 

Affection tely yours, 

S". B. Webb. 

Remember me to our mutual friend Haskc]'. I intend writing 
him bv the first o;ood convcvance.

- ^ Ueak liAERELL : — Enclosed you will h;iTC an order drew in 

iii ■ ■^ ' yonr favor by Colonel llichard Piatt on Messrs. Jonas Adams &amp; Co. 

for 302. |i Dollars equal to £120.18 currency, for which I gave 
£9.2.0 this I must have done, or given the same exchange for 
Crowns and light Gold, which would hare differed you one per 
cent, more ; it will undoubtedly be paid at the time due. I have 
likewise enclosed for your information the Statement of money re- 
ceived from Capt. Greene on yonr account, by which you'll oliserve 
this last order leaves a balance due me £45.3 Currency. Mr. 
Livingston and m}sclf will make a final settlement of the business 
as soon as he hears from Capt. Greene. When the remaining 
balance is received I will forward it yon by the first stage. 

Our P^lectiou for the State Convention begins on Tuesday anil 
probably will continue until Saturday. We have a Federal &amp; an 
Anti-Federal Ticket exhibited, but there is not a doidjt that we 
carry the Federal ticket in this City four to one, and I am happy to 
add that in tlie other counties we have flattering prospects. Some 
arc unanimous against us, but we think we have a good chance of 
getting at least an equal number of Federalists for the Convention, 
and of these wc shall boast all the good sense and shining Abilities. 

The Anti's cannot boast of a single Great Character on their 
side who will probably be a member ; — in short c(iual bets are taken 
that this State adopts the Xcav Constitution. 1 am not however 
very Sanguine that it will )je done by the first Convention. Amaz- 
ing exertions are made both for and against it, I enclose you our 
Federal ticket the Characters I think must please yon. The Gov't 
is at the head of the other. I likewise send you a small Pamphlet 
written by John Jay about ten days since, and which was a most 
astonishing influence in converting Anti-federalists to a knowledge 
and belief that the new Constitution was their only political Salva- 
tion. Your Hudson Strawberry Vines are at Mr. Pintards but no 
Vessels arc in Port bound to Boston. I hope one may soon offer, 
but should it prove too late Capt. Ricketts says he will with 
pleasure furnish yoir in the fall. My love to Sally and Hetty. I 
hope to sec them soon and you some time this summer. 1 am

Deai; IJAUUiiLi. : — I thank you for your favor of the -tth in- 
stant which came to hand by the Thursday's Post. '■' * * 

Yon have no idea of electioneering business. \\ ith you "tis all 
fair and quiet, but with us 'tis all confiision. I'arties for different 
sides appear publicly and sometimes blows ensue ; but in our late 
election for delegates for convention, we Federal Folks were so 
unanimous in this city that the Governor's party of Antis' shewed 
themselves only the first day, and were so very weak that we only 
heard of them afterwards l)y handbills, a number of which from 
both parties were in circulation. I enclose j"ou one (said to be writ- 
ten by Col. Hamilton) to show you how plainly we speak of our 
Governor, fn the great contested election before the Revolution, 
between the Livingstons and Delanceys. they could faintly muster 
only ab't 2,700. On the present occasion we have between 2,900 
and 3,000, out of w hicli we calculate the Antis' may have short of 
400, &amp; from all the information yet obtained, we judge about 37 
Federal members of Convention. The whole luimlier is 05, but no 
certainty. TJie voles cannot lie counleil mil il tlie last Tuesday of 
this month.

Wni. Livingston's Letter. 

Beverswtck, 28th May, 1781. 
EAK AVebb :— I have not heard a syllable from .John, Joe, or ^P' ^^^ ^ ^'! 
yourself since you left us. The girls returned from Earitan yes- 
terday. Betsey is well. I used when in the army, it is true, to 
ride in the night to get Home, but I never sent 148 miles two men 
on foot for a Letter. 

I came from Phila. on Sunday. The Marquis informs Con- 
gress Major-General Phillips of the British is dead. Green also 
writes tliat he is again before Camden and has not a Doubt of 
faTcinfj it. 

There has been a mutiny iu the Pennsylvania line at York 
Town previous to their marching. Wapic, like a good Officer, 
quelled it soon. Twelve of the fellows stepped out &amp; persuaded 
the line to refuse to march in consequence of the Promises made 
them not being complied with. WajTie told them of the disgi-ace 
they brought on the American arms while in Jersey in general, and 
themselves in particular ; that the feelings of the ofScers on that 
occasion were so wounded that they had determined never to expe- 
rience the like, and that he beg'd they would now fire either on 
him &amp; them or on those villains in front. He then called on such 
a Platoon. They presented at the word, fired and killed six of the 
villains. One of the others, badly wounded, he ordered to be 
bayonnetted. The soldier on whom he called to do it, recovered 
his Piece &amp; said he could not for he was his comrade. AVayne then 
drew a pistol and said he would kill him. The fellow then ad- 
vanced &amp; Bayonnetted him. Wayne then marched the line by 
Divisions around the Dead, &amp; the rest of the fellows are ordered to 
l)e hang'd. The line march'd the next day southward mute as fish. 

Please to desire Joe or Huntington to send my trunk on l)y 
your waggon. 

Give my love to the officers with you, and believe me. 

Yours sincerely, c 

Col. Wi;bb. W. X LrvixG.sTON'. ^ '

Dec. 9, 1777. 

Ok Boakd the Schl-yler, 
Tuesday, Evening, Dec. 9, 1777. 

The several Vessels under Convoy and in company with the 
Schuyler are carefully to keep company^never to be out of hail 
ahead. The Schuyler will take care to shorten sail as occasion may 
require. 

The signal for landing Ijy night A\'ill be a false fire — by day 
setting the Ensign ; immediately the troops to be ready as fast as 
possible to step into the boats. 

Capt. Wooster of the Grenadiers, with the three right hand 
divisions to disembark and cover the landing of the detachment. 
He will take care to advance double sentinels in front. 

Capt. Hart on Landing will form on the right ; the others in 
course. Capt. ^loseley at the left of the Line. 

So soon as the signal is given a iirofound silence to take place, 
none but the commanding officers of Divisions to be suffered to 
speak a loud word. 

After landing, the Adjutants will see that they are properly 
formed in subdivisions ; the Artillery will form in front between 
the Grenadiers and the Column ; no man then to leave his ranks 
on any pretence. 

The Colonel has the gi-catest confidence in the Troops he has 
now to command, and doubts not that they will do Honor to their 
Officer as well as themselves, for which it is absolutely necessary 
there should be a strict compliance with orders. Those that do it 
will receive the treatment due to good soldiers ; but on the least 
variation necessity will oblige the commanding officer to make 
paiblic example of the offenders.

Colo. Trumbull went from hero to-day to Peekskill ; if you 
could get into his case, he will, I am persuaded, put it into hands 
that will not suffer it to be stolen or adulterated on the way ; but 
as his stay there will be very short, I must request j^our attention to 

this matter if he should become of . I have also to thank you, 

sir, which I do very sincerely, for the map which will, if we should 
have occasion to nuinocuvre about in the parts described by it, be 
very useful to me. 

I was led to believe by Gen'l Parsons, that the Connecticut 
Regiments would average about GOO men each. Yours having been 
put upon the same footing with the eight of that State I was in 
hopes to have found stronger than you have mentioned. I am, with 
sincerity,

the several propositions that have been made Ijy the enemy, we 
should have to give them in a general exchange of our officers for 
officers and privates of the Convention troops. By submitting this 
to Congress, if necessary they will be the better able to decide on

A^a. ru. matter,'jior Avould I choose to make alterations in it before the first 
/^- day of January, when it is to become final, if there does not appear 



f" 7 to "have been some deviation from the principles contained in the 

act of Congress of the 7th of August. ;ire injurious to the public 
interest. 

The good of the service, I hoped, would have been the govern- 
ing princii)ie in arranging tlie officers, and I cannot but flatter my- 



153 



self the agreements among tlie several grades of oflieers may yet be 
rendered subservient to that end. 

As soon as Colonel Jackson shall be able to join the Light 
Corps (which it is expected will be the case in a few days) I shall 
have no objection to your attending to the particular interests of 
your regiment in the Tiine. 

I am, sir, 

Your most obedient servant,

rcvcnted us from traveling with any great Expedition, and must 
have rendered our Jaunt very disagreeable, had not a variety of

Wethersfield on Saturday Xoon, where we staid till Sunday Morn-

ashamed of being old, the first time we made nse'of a clawed hand- • 
gpike, it broke a hole through ; notwithstanding, the wench knew 
it was directly over the magazine. Upon the whole, if there comes 
peace, I would recommend her and her apparatus, to be sent to the 
Koyal Society ; and I dare eat a red-hot gridiron if ever they have 
had, or will have, imtil the day of judgment, any curiosity equal to 
her. I liavn't time to give you her character in full, but, in short, 
she is the devil. But while I can keep the sea and light only on 
unarmed vessels, she will do very well. But if obliged to fire l&gt;oth 
guns of a side at a time, it would split her open from her gunwale 
to her keelson. 

Pray make my compliments to all friends. Tell friend \Miite, 
Plymouth is better than all the Ehode and Xewport to boot. My

Cajitains have enlisted more than their complement, and some who 
came too late have bought in, rather than be disappointed of a 
share in the service. Samuel Webb is Lieut, in your brother's place.

I entertain for you, some matters in wliicli it may, j)erhaps, be in 
your power to serve me. 

Yon know my Reasons for leaving the Army, and I liave an 
opinion tliat you do not disapi)rove of tliem. I tliought retire- 
ment more lionorahlc than service under an unwortliy Com- 
mander. 

As I was ever fond of a military life, and entered very Early 
into the Service, I made a great sacrifice in giving uj) the rank I 
had acquired, but my consolation was that the (ien'l ajiproved 
of it. 

Isow, my friend, what I would wish of you is that, as your 
situation places yorx near and frequently in Company of his Excel- 
lency and the Generals, yon would take occasion to mention your 
Friend, not as coining from him, for your own delicacy will ])oint 
out to you the impropriety of that, but as a spontaneous idea of 
j-onr own. I cannot ask anything of the General, nor will I of 
Congress ; and yet I wish to take a part in this Summer's Cam- 
paign. 

Your good friend Gen. Green has doubtless many occasions of 
Employing in his Department those who have served in the Army ; 
if you think it worth while, I l)cg you to mention me to him. In 
short as you know me, and what will suit my turn, do for me in 
the same manner you would have me do for you in the same cir- 
cumstances.

Dear Cor, : — I am to aeknowledge tlie receijit of yours, of the 
aid loth instant, by C'liadwiek A Bilding, the latter arrived on 
the 15th, verv unwell, by reason of his stay here so long. 



iGi; 

By both of yoTir letters, I find Mrs. Wcbl) eontiniacs in a 
dieting state. My dear Colonel, I feel most sensibly for yon. and 
fear, ere long, you ninst taste the bitter cui) I have drank so largely 
of. Heaven forbid that so great a l)lessing should be snatelicd h-om 
you in the bloom of life. 

Your letter for Capt. Weljb, have sent to him. 

Last Tuesday, we encamped on this Thunder Hill, and the 
same evening marched for Stamford, in Conn., ivitli our Brigade. 
After we arrived within about 7 or 8 miles of our port, was informed 
that the Burning, Murdering, poor pitiful set of dogs had weighed 
anchor, and had made tlie best of their way to N. York — as the 
particulars of this burning expedition is not got to hand. I shall 
refer you to public accounts for them ; reports say, GO or TO killed 
of the inhabitants in (Jroton Fort, the greatest part all murdered 
after they had laid down their Arms. The gi-eatest part of New 
London in Ashes, we returned to our encampment three days since. 
The "West Point Dctachmeiit joins us tliis week. Orders are out 
for the Enemy to hold themselves in readiness lo start at the 
shortest notice. 

I have rcc'd a letter from Col. Smith for you, which I have 
taken the liljerty to open ; the one inclosed in it to the father I 
shall forward the first opportunity. Inclosed I send you your letter 
with the one from Col. Smith. It contains good news. I think 
Mr. C'ornwallis will get the (torn) i)ut taken out of his Eyes this 
heat, should this be the case, I think Mr. Arnold's Burning Expedi- 
tion will be at an end. I hope Mr. &amp; Miss Webb's health may be 
so recovered as we may be honoured with your agreeable company 
soon. My most respectful Compliments waits on your agreeable 
family, which has my best wishes for their prosperity and happiness. 
The gentlemen of the Eeg't are well except Capt. Kiley, who has 
been for 2 or ;j days unwell — biisiness calls and I must break short 
off. lam, Dear t'ol. with Kvcry Sentiment of Esteem your most 
obd't Serv't.

Headqiarters, Nov. Ilth, ITS-^. 
Sir : — As there has been no official report made to me of the 9^^-^ '^•^'» 
arrangement of the Connecticut Line, I cannot interfere in the 
matter, nor would I choose to make alterations in it before the first 
day of January, when it is to become final, if there docs not a]&gt;i)ear 
(o have been some (U'viation from the iiriiiciples contained in the 
act of Congress of the ^thof August, or injurinus to the |inlilic 
interest. 



1G8 

The good of the service, I hoped, would have been the govern- 
iiig principle in arranging the oflficcrs, and I cannot but flatter my- 
self the agreements among the several grades of officers may yet be 
rendered subsenient to that end. 

As soon as Colonel Jackson shall be al)le to join the Light 
Corps (which it is expected will be the case in a few days) I shall 
have no objection to your attending to the ])articular interest.^ of 
your regiment in tlie Line. 

I am, sir.

and iiiterestins' ever Jsiiowii to tlie iieojile of America. But alas 
for the ignorance of many of the anti-federalists I Notwithstandin;; 
the most energetic arguments and the clearest demonstrations for 
the adojition of the Constitution, urged by the two gentlemen 
above mentioned, they are regardless of the fatal conse(iuences re- 
sulting from a re.iection of it, if Congress should receive it as such. 

Mr. Hamilton a|)]iearcd to be much im^iressed with a sense of 
this imjiortant crisis, and while he exerted every faculty to shew 
them the improbability that their adoption would be accci)ted, en- 
treated them to be very delil)erate and cool, in determining per- 
haps, not only the fate of the pi'esent, but of many gencKitions. 

Mr. (lillicrt Livingston seemed to coincide with Mi-, ilaniilton, 
and moved likewise for a post])onement of the (|iicstioii, although 
Mr. Lansing and one or two others used every effort, Imt Inqipily 
in vain, that the (juestion might be lirimght forwanl inimedialeiy. 

The debates this inorniiig were opened by Mr. Sinitli, who 
spoke a considerable time, but J think to littk' imrpose. He a|i- 
pears to be willing to rest ii]ion an uncertainty, for he cannot be 
certain that the manner in whicli they mean to adojit the Constitu- 
tion uill bo esteemed as a ratitication. He was followed liy the 
IIoiioral)lc Mr. Jay, who after a long controversy about a compari- 
son made by himself, silenced bis oj)poneiit. He was succeedeil 
again by Mr. Harrison, who. in elegant language, ami witJi becom- 
ing niodestv, pointed out our critical situation. 



170 

After Mr. Harrison liad spoken the ((xiestion which I have be- 
fore sjjoken of waa brought forward, to prevent the decision of 
which Mr. Hamilton, the American Cicero, arose. Several gentle- 
men have told me that Mr. Jones is very much terrified. This day 
lie was absent ; on account of sickness his son told me, though I 
conjecture political sickness. 

To-morrow, Sir, the fate of this State, and i)erhaps of all 
America, will be determined. I tremljle at the thought of intestine 
commotion, and if this manner of ratification should not be valid, 
may Heaven prevent that fellow citizens and countrymen sliould 
batlic their swords in each other's l)loo(l. 

(Jive my love to the family. 

I remain, Sir, with great resjjcct.

Sii! : — At the time you wt^*f pleased to honor me with a visit, 

■ft gave me very much concern, that indispensible attendance with 
the regiment had called me frecjuently abroad : and the more so, 
as vou had quitted the City before I had it in my jjower to pay you 
my respects. 

I^he apjdication I made in your behalf with (ieneral Jones, was 
unfortunately too late ; liad I had a more early intimation of your 
wish, it is probable better success would have attended my entreaty. 
Mr. Boudinot was gone and that business so far closed, that Gen'l 
Jones (who seemed extremely desirous of rendering justice to 3'our 
liretensions) w.^ved at that juncture an interference, from a doubt 
how far Sir H"y Clinton might have approved of all that iuxd been 
already agreed to. However, Sir, you may rest assured, I shall bo 
ready to catch at the iirst opening to forward the object of your 
wishes, and shall at all times be happy in the opportunity of con-

Dear .Sii; : — {len"l Williamson, who commands a Detachment 
of the Continental Army in Georgia writes to Congress on the IGtli 
Feb'y that the Enemy on the 15th had abandoned Angnsta, having 
*' in vain Endeavored to .use the Indians against ns. The Creek 
" Xation, which is the most jjowei-ful, refused in particular even to 
attend a Conference to which they were invited. They were making 
V il/ir AvwvwA.^ the be^t of the way to fcttHMiii and two Bodies of men were detached 
to fall in on the Hear. 

The Express who brouglit the Letters says that the night before 
he left Charlcstown, an account had arrived at that ])lace, that most 
of their Baggage, and a number of Prisoners had fallen into onr 
hands. A Body of Armed Tories, in number about 300. were at-

ength reduced to the necessity of soliciting your excellencies per-

being almost destitute of any of the necessaries of life to support 
tlicni, by reason of sickness which they have experienced all the last

u|)on me liy every .severed tie of humanity to relieve their distress 
as much as lies in my jxiwcr: whicji I can not do whilst in service, 
as 1 am greatly reduced iiy tlu' continuance (if the war, so that 1 
am Tiot able to furnish myself with clothing and other necessaries 
tliat arc decent and needful whilst in service. 

Neither can I do it without my pay which is remaining due. 
being destitute of parents to give me or my family any iLssistance. 

I have also devoted uj) the best ]iart of my days with cJieer- 
fidness in the service of my country ; which has very much hurt my

been really so since the night before last. I am very agreeably ac- 
commodated by Mrs. Yard with twoj;ooms, and have every thing 
provided in an elegant, neat manner, so that I have not the smallest 
trouble in my new state as a housekeeper. Absolutely I don't envy 
the happiest man oil earth. *

Heap Quarters. Cross Koads, 

BrcKS CorsTY, 

IGtb Aug., i;7r. 

Dear Weisb : — I ciinnot tell tlie reason of your so soon drop- 
ping tbe correspoudenee between ns. I am confident this is not 
my fault, for I tliink you are indebted to me if I am not vcrj' much 
mistaken, but be that as it may, we should not be ceremonioiis 
when we. consider the. many agreeable hours we have passed togetlier 
&amp; in a family so happy and agreeable as the good General's. 

Our good friend Cary I have not heard from by letter, since ho 
left us. I shall write him by the next post to desire him to let me 
know the reason. If any one had told me it would have been so 
long I would have ))een very angry ; however, I intend acting a 
generous part with all my old acquaintances in the latter way. 

I have nothing here to ^Tite you. Gen'l Howe with the fleet, 
has not been heard of to onr knowledge since the ninth, and then 
they were seen off Cencpulkcn, standing to the southward. This 
manoeu^TC of Gen'l Howe's occasions, and I believe those who were 
so sagacious of his watching this movement to the southward as a 
finesse give up the jjoint. and they can not think the North River 
is his object, ilauy may yet think that the Delaware is his object, 
but let the world say what they will, I will never alter my opinion 
of his going up the Xorth Kiver, for he can have nothing of so 
much consequence to British arms in view as that at, this juncture. 

Hi« Excellency would be glad to know if you received any 
money of his for the use of the family when at White Plains or 
after you left York Island until you came to Hackensack, or while 
you remained with the family, for lie has been making np his ac- 
counts, and he thinks he has spent moneys out of his own ]irivate 
purse, and no charge made for it to the ])ublic of it. 

It is his wish that you would let me know as soon as jjossible, 
&amp; to make the letter come more safe to me you will direct &amp; enclose 
it to him for fear it should miscarry. 

The Lads are all well and desire to be remembered. 
I am. 

Yours sincerely,

West Poist, Sept. 27tli, 1779. 
Deak Col. : — I roeeivcd jonr favor of tlic 23d the same day 
you wrote i t^.^. 

fTl hope you are fully convinced of the temper and disposition 
of the two Gentlemen at Head Quarters. Did I not tell you which 
of the two was the most candid and sincere? Depend upon it, you 
will ever find him so. Since you was here, I have said notliing 
upon the subject, but you may rest assured, I shall do you all the 
service in my power. However, I told you before, and repeat it 
again, it is difficult to carry a point with a man, when it is against 
his popular interest ; Inxt the General is a man of a million, and I 
doubt not, will, do you justice, in due season. 

I believe the General Officers intend to send in a Memorial to 
Congress, upon the grievances of the Officers of the Arm}-. Wliat 
it will produce I cannot sa}'. Perhaps a disagi-eeable quarrel. 
I have not time to add only that I am with 
gi'eat regard. 

Your most obedient humble ser..

General Greene's Letter. 

West Point, Octo. ID, 177D. 

Dear Sii; : — Your brother's obstinacy deprives me of an op- 
portunity of writing a full answer to your letter. I have been en- 
deavoring to prevail on him to stay to-day, but cannot. The desire 
of being thought a man of great business, or his passionate fond- 
ness for his wife, has overruled all my arguments and persua- 
sions. My loss will )je his family's gain ; and all that I shall say 
about it is, he is a very obstinate clever fellow. 

With respect to your own concerns, I can give you no new ad- 
vice, luit wish you to pursue the policy recommended, which was 
obstinately to persevere in claiming your right of exchange upon a 
principle of ])rivate equity. You must be moderate but steady in 
th^ demand. You know the difficulty and the great bar to the 
business. Tliis will follow you like your shadow. However. I 
think vou will succeed at last.

iyMT, 







There has a new difficulty arose respecting rank, between 
you and Col. Shcrburue ; but I imagine tliis will vanish upon ex- 
amination. I hope yoii are philosopher like, prepared for all 
events. 

Count d'Estaing is laying siege to the Capital of Georgia. 
There a*© flying reports that he has succeeded in part. I wish he 
may fully accomplish his design. He is shortly exjjected here 
with an intention to co-operate with us in an attempt upon New 
York. I am not sanguine in this expectation. It is a great object 
tb«t the Count will not I fear be detained long enough, to give 
success to the business. It will be an up-hill piece of work, and 
terminate in a Winter Campaign if attempted. But this under the 
rose^ have intelligence from Providence that the enemy are evacu- 
ating Newport. This will add new difficulties to the enterj^rise 
upon New York. However we arc in good health and high spirits 
fit for almost any undertaking. Small difficulties will vanish be- 
fore us, if the Count shall agree to co-operate with us in an attempt 
upon the City. ^i/i/ajLA^ 

I am with good wishes 

for your health &amp; prosperity, 
Your friend &amp; humble ser. ,

Dear Sir 



General Greene's Letter. 

West Poixt, October 28th, 1779. 
-Col. Beatty delivered uie your letter last Even- 



ng. 



Should there be any serious opposition to your claim in point 
of Rank, my little influence shall not be wanting to set you right. 

Great political characters generally govern themselves more by 
maxims of jDolicy than by what is called private justice ; and ui^on 
this principle you are to interpret their actions and intentions. 
The rights and claims of individuals have but a feeble voice, and 
are faintly heard amidst the clamOT and noise of contending par- 
ties. In vain will you plead the merit of past services, personal 
sufferings, or sacrifices, when those pleas and those claims are op- 
posed by superi^' interest.

The doctrine of politicks is not iinlike the laws of nature where 
the weaker is ever obliged to give place to the stronger. Happy he 
who has a powerful interest to support him, and trusts not to private 
virtue, to contend with Jarring interests. 

The secret springs of human actions, are difficult to investigate ; 
and the wishes and intentions of a thorough paced politician not 
easily discover|d. But I think we may pretty fairly conclude that 
when we find a delay in obtaining justice, and obstacle upon ob- 
stacle hove in our way, that there is some interest opposed to our 
wishes. I will not say that this is your situation, but leave you to 
think and judge for yourself. 

Col. Beatty whose letter will accompany this, will be a mes- 
senger of ill news to you. Mr. Loring has made a demand of all 
the Prisoners on Parole, to return to captivity. This I suppose is 
in canscquence of General Phillips &amp; Keidesel being refused the 
liberty of going into New York. I think it will be your first busi- 
ness to bring this matter to an explanation, both with the Gen- 
eral and the Congress. I would never agree to Loring's pro- 
position, nor give up the Parole of the prisoners belonging 
to the Eagle Paquet upon that footing, and I would urge the 
General anew to demand my exchange immediately if I was in 
}'our place. 

The summons must be peculiarly disagreeable after such 
bright prospects of an exchange as you once had. Human life is 
chequered mth evi'i. It often happens when we are swimming on 
vrith the tide of good fortune, we are shipwrecked in full view of 
the haven of our happiness ; and again when we are ready to sink 
into rain, we are delivered when we least expect it ; and some- ^^ 
times from a quarter whence we could have had no hopes. It is 
tlic business of a soldier and a philosopher to be prepared for what- 
ever may happen. ^ 

Whatever services I can render you, shall not be wanting to 
accomplish your wishes. 

The Enemy is in the State of New Jersey. They landed at 
Amboy and have been at Brunswick and Middlel/rook. We have 
no jiartieulars of their depredations. They are said to l)e about 5,000 
strong. 

General Sullivan, Lord Sterling and General Wayne are said to 
lie on their march to check their ravages.

General Greene's Letter. 

MoKEiSTOWN, Dcccm. 21st, 79. 
;2», ' I Dear Sir : — Your polite and agreeable letter of the 8th came 



\jJJ^ to hand last Evening. An Express goes to Hartford this morning, 
and your great anxiety to liear from Camp induces me to write you 
a line, altho' I am crowded on every side with business. 

Col. Sherburne has been frequently at my quarters since his 
arrival, but I have had no fair opportunity of opening the subject 
to him. The principle I am told upon which he claims rank of 
yoij is, that yoiT had no rank from being aide-de-camp ; and he has 
but too much foundation for this opinion, from the sentiments of the 
Gentlemen at Head Quarters ou this qiiestion. It is an opinion 
that I always opposed, as repugnant to reason and common sense, 
that a person might have rank, and yet not have it. You may rest 
assured that nothing on my part shall be wanting, to do you 
justice, and I shall esteem it a pleasure to have it in my power to 
serve you. 

I have heard nothing further respecting your exchange, and 
know not how to mention the matter to the general respecting a 
meeting with General Philips. Such a meeting may produce some 
good consequences, but I really don't believe the General would be 
very fond of the measure. In your next I beg you to be more par- 
ticular respecting your own exchange, and in what you wish me to 
aid vou. ^.- 



193 

We sliall 1)C' happy to see you at Camp, wlicrc you will liml the 
true militai7 spirit, justice and generosity. The great body of the 
People you know are contracted, selfish, and illiberal ; and there- 
fore not calculated to harmonize with a noble nature like yours. It 
is astonishing when one takes a view of human nature (even in this 
free Comitiy) to see how much it is under the dominion of ignor- 
ance and prejudice, bound down to rules and modes of behavior j^S 
that have neither pleasure nor profit/ to recommend them. But 
where am I running upon a siieculative subject^y^ot less than a . ^J- 
dozen people are waiting while I gallop you this letter, for it cannot 
be called writing. ^ 

(^TTmust stop short and wish you good by, and beg my kind com- 
pliments to Mrs. Webb and her jolly husband — Please also to re- 
member me to Col. Chester and his family ; in doing this you will 
^ / not forget to couple Mr. Greene with mc.who is a great admirer of 
the happy circle at Wealhersfield. 

The Commissary's and Forage Departments are in a damnable 
situation for want of money. Col. Wadsworth is at Philadelphia 
swearing like a disappointed Jeiv Turk. General Arnold's trial 
comes on to-day, he has not arrived this morning but is hourly 
expected. 

With esteem &amp; regard, 

I am yours, sincerely, 

Colo. Webb. Nath. Greene. 

I thank you kindly for the Patterns you have bo't for mo^ for 4. *^ 

a pairs of small Cloth^ and Waiscoat, and wish you to forward 
them. ^

Camp Prerase . ^ , near Paeamus, ^ 

July .ith, 1780. .T'T^'^ ^. 
Dear Sir : — I was made happy by your letter of the 26th of 
last month. There is a mixture of pain and pleasure to hear at 
the same time, the danger our friends have been exposed to, and 
their happy escape from it. You have been ill, but have got well. 



104 

The iilarin was no sooner, than joy succeeded it, from your re- 
covery. 

I return you many thanks for your polite attention to Mrs. 
Greene. I must remain your debtor until you will give me an op- 
portunity to escort Mrs. Webb in the same way, and I can assure 
you nothing would give me greater ijleasure. 

Be not afraid of matrimony, trust me it will not injure you. 
They who engage in this connection, live for themselves, those who 
avoid it live for others. My greatest happiness is of the social 
kind ; and I am sure a mind jjossessed of your sensibility must 
enjoy the most refined pleasures from so tender a connection. Let 
the giddy and unthinking laugh ; the pleasures of the rational and 
the wise, have always been the sport of fools, and strange as it may 
appear, I firmly believe that matrimony, generally speaking, lessens 
our expenses as well as enlai-ges our felicity. 

The Enemy have left this State, and upon the whole, have no 
gTeat things to boast of. Since you left Morris, Sir Harry Clinton 
arrived, and made some demonstrations as if he intended an attack 
upon "West Point, but dare not attempt it. It is said he is now in 
the borders at West Chester, destroying the forage of that County, 
to prevent our availing ourselves of it hereafter, should we have 
' /WU any «ggae*ii&gt;c ojierations in contemplation against New York. 

The Congress are dreaming as usual ; your very good friend 

(f" Sir Eoger is playing his old game of little tricks, and pursuing his 

former scale of pennyj#-habj3enny politics ; and unfortvinately for 

iN*^ America, he finds enough of his kidney to join him, to form a ma- 

" jority in the House. 

The Committee of Congress have almost all got sick ; and we 
are almost sick of them all, except Schuyler. The other two dare 
not do what they know to be right. Popularity is the bane of 
American Liberty, and if a different policy is not pursued hereafter, 
ten to one but it proves our ruin. 

Please to make my respectful compliments to j'our brother and 
family. 

I am with the 

greatest respect. 

Your most obed't 

humble ser't, 
Col Webb. K"ath GEEEjfE.

Dear Webb : — I was this minute favoured with j-ours of the 
IGth Inst. I am happy to hear 3-ou are recruiting witli so much 
■ success. Do, my good lad, push matters as much as possible — be- 
lieve me, when I tell you, the situation of our affairs calls loudly 
for great exertions. Could we hut get an army directly in the field, 
we might hope for, may be certain of the most happy events. 

lu respect to the arms you mention, which were in the hands 
of Colo. Lee, application was made for them some time ago by the 
Council of Massachusetts State for some of their 15 Regiments, 
and an order given for their delivery. Your officers have been 
much spoken of, and I have no doubt that they will do honour to 
themselves &amp; their Counti-y. They are gentlemen, which is the 
best security for their well doing. 

I am extremely obliged by your kindly excusing my not writ- 
ing. You have, my good friend, 7iii upon the true cause. We have 
moi"e and more business daily. AYe have not time to. I have men- 
tioned you with great resjDeet to our worthy Gcn'l &amp; to all your 
friends. They all thank you for your remembrance &amp; have their 
regards for you. 

I have nothing material to inform j^ou of, &amp; if I had, time 
would not permit. I rejoice to hear of the Capture you mention, 
but is it to be depended on? You know the necessity of posts &amp; 
authenticated Water Town intelligence. 

My Compliments to your Brother Mr. J. Webb, to Major Hunt- 
ington, &amp; not forgetting Chester, wishing you all happy, 
I am your affec. H'le Serv't,

Dear Sir : — Upon our arrival at Fairfield, we found affairs 
not in exactly the same situation we expected, in consequence of 
which. General Parsons desires you will order your march so as not 
to arrive at the place before Wednesday night. On this plan, the 
Detachment from Col. Cook's Reg't will be able to join your Troops 
when they move from Danbury. 



19G 

As there is no issiiing store at this place, by tlie Geii'l's direc- 
tion I have wrote to Mr. Lloyd upon the subject, who will doubtless 
supply you as desired. 

In addition to the siargeon you already hare, Gen'l Parsons 
would wish you to apply to Doct. Turner for another surgeon and 
a suitable quantity of bandages. 

Your prudence will suggest every precaution to prevent suspi- 
cion &amp; conjecture from raging, to the extreme degTee, it is to be 
feared, they otherwise will. 

I am. Dear Sir, with sincere respect 

Your most Ob't Humb. Serv't, 

D. Humphreys. 

P. S. — Since writing the above, I am informed your TroojDS 
are much nearer than was expected. Tho' the Gen'l is gone to 
New Haven, I am persuaded it will be most agreeable to him to halt 
at some distance from Fairfield: The Gen'l, I imagine, will be 
back this evening.

Init without success. He has, however, given me his word that he 
will write instantly to General Washington for his approliation, and 
in case his permission can be got, I have left directions for Col.

Be assured I shall leave nothing undone to ser\'e a friend as I so

our different destinations (cursed refuge). I've met with Col. Jiles 
here whose horses and servant I get to carry me the length of Phila- 
delphia where I shall do myself the pleasure of delivering your letter. 
You may expect a line from me as I pass through this to join

Dear Webb : — By Mr. Jones the Bearer of this, I had the 
first information of your Eeturn to Wethersfield, tho' had before 
heard you was out of N. York on Parole. When he informed 
me you had got home, my first question was, have you got any 
Letters or letter for me, to which he gave me an answer in the Ne- 
gative. You will readily believe me not a little disappointed ; I 
assure I was, but when he informed me you did not know of his 
setting out, I Pardoned you, but shall not extend it io\ forty Days, 
tho' Mr. Jones tells me you expect to be here next week. I wish it 
may be sooner. 

I wish to see you much, Ijoth on my own acc't and yours, as 
I believe jov. will not find your money accounts in the situation you 
expected they would have been before this time. I hoi)e you will 
bring on your papers that you may be able to close some of the ac- 
counts that remain unclosed. Your clothing accounts I have with 
me. You will scarcely know your Eegiment wlien you arrive, 
your officers new as to the Rank they now hold, except two. The 
soldiers as usual well around, tolerably Discij)lined, but badly 
clothed. 

You know it is natural for a man who is answerable for the 
appearance of aJKeg' if he is faulty, to make or rather to meditate 



199 

an excuse. My great aiul iirincipal one is, the new method of Dis- 
cipline iutroclaced, makes an alteration from the old greater and 
more difficult than to instruct new troojis — why they will appear to 
you raw undisciplined is obvious, because your situation has much 
too long been where we have been taught to look as a Pattern for 
Discipline. But why need I trouble you with that, you will say — I 
can give you a very good reason, which is, that when you left 
the Eegiment you thought them disciplined, and of coiirse you 
might have reason to expect to find them so when you return. Un- 
less I informed you to the contrary, the mortification you would 
show in your countenance would be so gi'eat that I could not but 
discern it, &amp; of course feel it myself, which to avoid, this serves to 
make you come prepared. Pray did you see anjihing of Lieut. Col. 
Livingston as you came from Philadelphia, has he resigned, is he 
dead, or is he coming to join the Regiment? I have not heard a 
word from him since Jan. 7 last, except in the Round about flay. 
The Gentlemen officers desire their friendly compliments to you, 
I rejoice that you are once more in the Land of Liberty, tho' uni- 
versally wish, and I believe most sincerely, that your stay was like to 
be longer than the uncertainty of a Parole will give them reason 
to believe ; tho' they are highly flattered with the pleasing expecta- 
tion }'ou will soon pay them a visit, altho' they are stationed m this 
dreary and Dismal Part of God's Creation. I wish most earnestly, 
that your Exchange may be so speed}', that instead of a visit, you 
may join in and take Command of a Reg't, who regret your inac- 
tive situation as they wish to be iTuder your Lnmediate Command, 
as doth your

Heabquartees, Morristowx. 

MoKRiSTOwx, 24 Dec, 

17T9, in Camp. 

Dear Webb : — Your favor of the 11th Instant came safely to 
hand. Permit me to thank you sincerely for it, as it took me to 
Weth'f'd while reading it. You will by the date perceive that we 
are in camp, tho' expect if good weather, to have the men's Hutts 
so far completed that they may go into them on Sunday or Mon- 
day. The officers hutts are not begun, nor will they be meddled 
with till the men are covered. My own Hutt will not be meddled 
with till after the officers have finished theirs. The severity of 
the weather hath been stich that the men have sufiered much ; 
without shoes and stockings, and working half leg deep in snow. 
Poor fellows, my heart bleeds for them, while I Damn my cottn- 
try as void of gratitnde. 

I wish that you would send me all the clothing in store imme- 
diately, I much w;mt it for the men, though am positively for- 
bid by the General itsing any scarlet coats on any acc't. I wish 
that Wyllys who will be at home soon might have it in his power 
to receive me clothing and forward it to the Eegiment. 

Since I saw you I have had a small interview with Col. 
Livingston, but expect to have a thorough investigation of matters 
to-morrrow. Apropos Livingston &amp; Van Zandt fought a duel the 
day before yesterday — fired twice each, Livingston lodged both 
his balls in Van Zandt's body or rather Breast, tho' neither of 
them entered the trunk of his body. He is now confined to his 
room, tho' he is likely to be well soon. Friend Scammell will give 
you the particulars. Money is gQod for nothing here, no not a 
Rush. So if you intend to live when you some to camp, do you 
bring a good store. 

I am sorry that Hetty should be vexed for having the credit of 
a speech, which too frequently may be made with propriety. 

My love to Her &amp; Mrs. Webb, Compliments to your Lazi/ 
Brother, &amp; believe me, sincerely Yours, 

Colo. Webb. Eb. Huntington. 

Col. Beatty has this minute call'd on me in expectation of Re- 
ceiving some Coffee which your Brother informed him I had 



201 

brought ou in my wagon— it is a mistake, as I brought on only 
one box &amp; that was for Genl. Greene. I have deliv'd the box to 
Genl. Greene, &amp; suppos'd it was for him. Possibly part of it was for 
Col. Beatty. Your Brother can tell.

Dear ^^ ebb : — A few days since I wrote you by my old friend 
Col. FifiCiteH, since which hare not been favored with any of yours. 
^^^t&gt;^ At that time I wrote you about forwarding the clothing now in 
"^ store, must again wish it done if possible, particularly the small 

clothing, as we are in very great distress for the want of it. Our 
men are very destitute of clothing and entirely so of State refresh- 
ments, I wish it was better attended to by the State, as the money 
if the men had it, would not purchase them refreshments here which 
are highly necessary for their comfort. 

Cols. McGaw, Ely, Ramsay, &amp;c., came out of X. York on 
Parole three days since with proposition from Sir Henry 
Clinton for an Exchange. They laid those proposition before his 
Excellency j-esterday, but as yet have not received his answer. If 
they do not effect it, they will return again soon. Capt. Williams 
is ou duty at Paramas where (he writes us) he is most agreeably 
situated. I expect his return in about a week. Our men's Hutts 
:ire so nearly completed as to receive nearly all the men under cover, 
to-morrow ; God willing they will leave their tents and the officers 
will begin on theirs. 

Capt. Wyllys who delivers this goes on to meet the Committee 
for Settling the Depreciation, hope justice will be done &amp; the Army 
be satisfied. 

My most friendly compliments attend the Circle in their winter 
pleasures. 

The Gentlemen of the Ilegiment Present their Compliments to

Dear Webb : — I wrote you a few days since by Capt. Wyllys, 
since which have not been favoured with any of j'ours. I impute it 
to want of time and opportunity. Since I wrote j'oi; by Capt. 
Wyllys we have been much distressed, four days without meat in 
our Brigade and six in some others, &amp; by the prospect before iis it 
is only a prelude to greater sufferings ; as the provisions received yes- 
terday by the Commy will afEord not quite two days allowance to 
the army, and no other Beef within reach unless we make a seizure 
on the property of the inhabitants, which is very disgreeable to our 
worthy Genl. Our men bear it with that fortitude which becomes 
the Christian &amp; freeman — tho' I am fearful their resolution will not 
be competent to the task, should the evil remain long. 

Yesterday we drew 114 coats, 117 vests, 12 breeches, 52 shirts, 
52 Hats and 52 pr. stockings ; which are to be delivered to men en- 
listed during the war. The supply is too small to do them jus- 
tice. Yon must think the others are not without their wants. I 
wish the State would forward some overhalls, shoes, shirts, stock- 
ings and vests as we much want them. If the State expect to re- 
inlist any of their troops it is highly necessary that the encourage- 
ment he fixed on soon, and that a jn-oper supply of clothing &amp; 
refreshments be forwarded. I believe it will be in my power to 
recruit the Regt. if the depreciation is soon made good, families at 
home supplied and a bounty of 3 or 4 hundred dollars given. Un- 
til then it is vain to attempt it. 

We have nothing new in this part of the world, except a 
Beport that Pensacola is taken, bi^t as yet it is not confirmed. 

I wrote a tantalizing letter to Hetty &amp; Sally inclos'd in your 
last about our assembly. To add let me tell you that we expect to 
open them the first of Feb'y or the 3d, which is the anniversary 
of the grand alliance. 

My compliments, &amp;c., to the Circle, &amp; Permit me to subscribe 
myself. 

Yours, sincerely, 

Colo. Webb. Ebex. Huxtixgto'x.

r.t. Colonel Huntington's Letter. '^^ ^eU iUcs 
MORRISTOWX, 22(1 Jany., 1780. 

Dear Webb :— By my friend Wadsworth, I shall just say that 
two days since I movod into a hutt, not my own, for that is not 
built, but into Captain Walker's Hutt, that I may ])e near to drive 
on my own. 

Were I to undertake to tell news I should hobble myself — for 
we have none— forgive me. Genl. Arnold's trial will be completed 
in two days as he has given in his defence and a very spirited one. 
The Court are forming their Judgment. It is expected he will be 
acquitted with honors. Geo. Eeed attended the trial and made a 
vei7 elegant speech to the Court. 

Col. Beatty is to be the subject of a Court Martial (the Judge 
Advocate informs me) for getting cloth for a woman's cloak from 
New York, which the General has some time since forbid in his 
orders. I do not know enough of the matter to say more. 

My friend Wadsworth can say more to you abont the reduction 
of Regiments than I know, as he is but three days from the Foun- 
tain of knowledge. I have sent a line to him to dine with me 
this day. I wish he may come, but have not received an answer. 

As the mouth of Feb'y is at hand, I must expect you soon un- 
less you will permit me to expect a little from your promise of 
coming — or less than from your promise of writing. For I assure 
yon I expected several letters before this time, but have received 
only one, which I have answered by five or six. Indeed that one 
fi'om you is the only one I have rec'd from Connecticut since I left 
it, &amp; expect it will be the last. 

As to the Staten Island frolick and the starving the army, 
ask AVadsworth. I can assure you I am very sorry that I was one 
of the party. 

The weather for four weeks past, has been severer than ever 
was known here for so long a time. 

It is necessary that you send or rather bring on all your ac- 
counts of clothing issued in '77 or 8, as Mr. Beers ex-jiects to close 
all clothing accounts with the auditors soon. It is really a matter 
of consequence as well as settling the I'ecruiting accounts. I am 
fearful von do not sufficientlv dread the delav. 



204 

Make my compliments, &amp;c. to Miss Welilj, Hetty, Abbey, &amp;c., 
and to the family at the mansion. 

A letter about Xothing, 

God bless you, 

Adieu, 

Eben. Huutingtox. 
I hardly dare mention it, but it is true. 

Command of the Brigade. 
Col. Webb. 

P. S. — By all means bring on a pair of files as we have a gentle- 
man in the Brigade who pushes elegantly and will teach me with 
pleasure. Remember. 

23d. When I finished my letter yesterday I was waiting to see 
Col. Wadsworth before I closed it, but instead of that pleasure I 
rec'd a line from him that lie was that instant setting off for Hart- 
ford. I was grievously disappointed, but put up with it with all 
the fortitude a chagrined man co^^ld do. 

23d, 12 o'clock at night. I now expect to forward this by 
Major Woodbridge, who was so polite as to call on me this evening 
and inform me that he shall set out next Tuesday. Should any- 
thing occur I shall make addition to-morrow. I wish you to tell 
friend Joe a line from him would be agreeable, as I am fearful his 
unwillingness to offend me is the reason he hath not wrote before. 
Very sleepy, adieu. 

3 o'clock. This moment I receive orders to go on command. 
I suppose to again, but know not. Two twelves &amp; eight sixes 
marched off with the detachment. I shall overtake them before I 
sleep, you may depend on it.

(/Ux^/Vv*. ivtvv' . Headquarters. 
' X MORRISTOWN, ICth, Feby., 1780. 

Dear Webb : — Your favor of the 3d Instant with that inclosed 
came safe to hand — am happy to hear that so many of mine went 
safe to you, tho' am certain that there are several that have not 
been acknowledged. In letters which were enclosed to me I put 
under cover &amp; scrr^ them by a trusty Serg', who returned yesterday 




205 

with all of them under cover of one from 'Mr. Banker to Miss 
Banker, &amp; them nuder coyer to me. I shall forward the same to- 
morrow to Mr. Lotts for Miss Banker, where she is at present on a 
visit as appears by the superscription. 

In expectation of your being here soon, this will be my last, &amp; 
from yonr known punctuality am doubtful whether this will find 
you (in the road or at Wethersficld, but bo that as it may, will 
a line or two and thank you for your long, friendly letter 
just acknowledged and note it by paragraph as I have it before 
me. 

The clothing you mention, I was oblig'd to di'aw to cover the 
nakedness of our poor distressed Lads. As to the recruiting of the 
Lads, it is almost impossible, as the money is good for little or 
nothing in this part of the World, much less than when we came 
here, &amp; from that they judge it will soon, very soon, be good for 
nothing. If the assembly and committee work spirited «&amp; speedily, 
am in hopes to detain some of those lads, whom I believe to be the 
best men in the world, but it is these speedy &amp; Liberal measures 
only that can do us any good in Eccruiting. 

As to the Genl. Exchange I wrote you some time since, that it 
was on the Tapis, but at present know no more. 

So it appears by your letter that your little parties of two or 
three are to be called dances. I am very sorry that Hetty &amp; Sally 
should be so taken up with the thoughts of dance, as to believe 
themselves in one because they have three dancers and a fiddler. 
Think of the assembly list, 130 Subscribers &amp; 165 Ladies on the 
list. The first bill is 12,000 N. Jersey, thus much for the assem- 
blies. 

My Hutt ah, my Hutt ! it is building &amp; will be till nearly the 
first of next month. Then, sir, I expect to open my doors and wel- 
come every guest that comes with stores, doubly to pay what he eats 
and drinks while with me. I expect to have about a dozen fine 
girls to drink tea with me the first aftei'noon. I think friend Webb 
you are very fortunate. I believe you to be the only man who is 
not, and hath not been for a long time froze. Pen &amp; ink also. It 
must have been d d cold weather in Connecticut to freeze every- 
thing so close, even the Mills of the Houses which used to go best 
in cold weather. I must suppose that the reasons of the Mills 
freezing is want of A man who goes to Mill as often a- the wants of 



»06 



the family require, will always find the stones in order and the 
Sluice sufficiently open for grinding. It makes me feel un- 
happy for those who get no grist this weather, but know- 
ing your friendly disposition, I think you will endeavour to 
remove their complaints, if they make any. When you come to 
Camp do you bring a letter from each and every of my AVethersfield 
friends. Girls £ Womens not excepted. 

I wish you to give my love to the Drawing Circle &amp; others 
with you, &amp; believe me to be 

Yours, sincerely, 

Eben. Huntixgton.

y- ( March, 1780. 

Dear AVebb : — Tliis whole day have I flattered myself with 
the pleasing thoughts of drinking tea at Mrs. Greens this afternoon 
in company with Miss Banker &amp; Miss Lott &amp;c., &amp;c. — but instead 
of that at 4 o'clock I find myself in Hutt, on business which 
threatens me during the evening. Upon some occasion I should 
suppose the weather might induce me to remain at home, but at 
this time the weather would be too trifling an excuse, &amp; on that ac- 
coimt, that Eascal of a Business has intended to prevent my promised 
pleasure. That being the case, permit me to trouble you in pre- 
senting my compliments to the Ladies, &amp; in the same way you 
speak for yourself ; then (in my misfortune) I shall be honored. 

Ashur waits on you for your directions for Grace. If yovir slender 
constitution will receive no injury from the weather nor your feel- 
ings, by the absence from the company of the Ladies &amp; Gentlemen, 
permit me to request your company at the Hutt this night &amp; in the 
morning you may enter on your command of me for the day. 

Adieu, 
Monday. E. Huntington. 

P. S.— Jackson will call for you on his return from Genl. 
Knox, &amp; expect your company to the Hidt.

MoRKiSTOWN, March, 1780. 

Dear Sir : — In answer to your note this mimxte received, say, 
that the reasons why I was not at my Friend Stewart's Quarters, I 
was engaged to dine at Col. Gramby's, &amp; stayed there the whole 
afternoon. When I left Col. Gramby's to go to Col. Stewart, it 
began raining very hard — roads excessive bad, being foggy. Know- 
ing that you dined at headtiuarters, it a])peared doubtful to me 
whether you would be there, tho' that would have been no excuse. 
I must depend on a sociable evening with you, &amp; am confident that 
my wish to be there was as great as any of the Company that I 
shoixld join them. 

I will be ready to wait on you to General Greene. When you 
call the Band will attend agreeable to your desire. 

My compliments to Colonel Stewart, &amp; the other gentlemen 
with you. Assure them it was not want of inclination that pre- 
vented my honoring myself with their company the last evening. 

I am yours, sincerely,

Camp, near Morristown, April, 1780. 
Thursday, 8 o'clock. 

Dear Webb : — Before I received your note by Richard, I sent 
a lad. witli one to Morristown, but it was too late, you had gone. 

I have sent by Richard a few balls which I have procured, but 
as to powder, or more ball, I can send none without making use of 
the public cartridges, which I cannot tliink justifiable. 

I have so often made excuse for not visiting Mr. Lott's family 
(tho' never without really ha^nng one) that I am unwilling to repeat 
it, but am obliged to in justification of my own feelings, and in 
compliance to the true politeness I have received from that family. 

The Ct. Martial is not dissolved and expect it will sit to-mor- 
row. I wish you to iissure Mr. Lott that I am not callous to the 
civilities I have received ; and to convince him, ivUl as soon as I 
can, take my horse in the morning &amp; just alight myself at Burwyck 
to spend the Day with the Family. 



208 

As soon as tlie weekly return is made out I will send him two 
Carpenters agreeable to liis desire for a week. Make my compli- 
ments to the family, &amp; believe me. 

Yours, sincerely.

Lt. Col. Huntington's Letter. 

Camp Tappan, 19th August, 1780. 
Dear Webb : — Inclosed you will receive the returns you wish 
for, except of those men enlisted since Jany. last, wEich do not pass 
through my hands, but are immediately to be settled with the P. 
M. Gcnl. in Camp. For that reason have made no mention of 
them to you. 

In my last, I made some mention of the uneasiness of the army ; 
it hath not totally subsided, nor do I think it will soon. They seem 
willing to suffer r.ny change thinking it cannot be tlic worse for 
theuij^ " in/iAjLff^^Li/u^Z/y 

,^^he officers of your Eeg't feel very -m^ at the neglect of the 
Board of War, in not forwarding the commissions agreeable to the 
arrangement long since sent on. His Excellency has wrote them 
once or twice about it. —Day before yesterday I had an Interview 
with him^ ^stated the disagreeable situation of the Keg', but more 
particularly of myself in having the command of the Reg'^and hav- 
ing my reputation at stake for their good conduct ; when wo have 
not officers enough to 'attend to the Police of it. _He said he was 
sensible of their situation^ &amp; would immcdiatly write the Board of 
War on the subject. I shall expect an answer next week. If they 
do not make the promotions ask'd fo'r, the officers will Resign. 
They are fully deteiTOin'd not to remain in such a situation any 
^ longer/-*** we have only four duty officers in the Regiment &amp; are 
order'cl to have 9 companies agreeable to the arrangement of the 
army — one of whicR" are in the ii-. Infantry ; " which leaves two 
cbmiianies to each officer in the Reg' instead of three officers to a 
company. My candle is nearly expired ; and this I borrowed from 
Hit' ' Cenl. Howe's qftarters, to compl/fci^ my Returns &amp; give you a line. 
' I have not been able to command a candle for six days jiast. We

Lieut. Col. Eb. Huntington's Letter. 

Camp Tex Eyck, 

4 miles from Hackensack, 
2 from New Bridge, 

opposite Fort Washington, 
30th August, 1780. 

Deak 8ik : — Our news is small, tho' possibly I may tell four 
days ago a duel was fought between Lt. Peyton and another officer, 
both of them of Maryland Horse ; Peyton was killed, the other, 
wounded. The next day a duel was fought between Baskenridge, 
Wm. Livingston &amp; a Jlr. Stack, volunteer in the Marcchosa Horse. 
Livingston was killed, &amp; Ijuried the night before last at Hacken- 
sack. I pity poor Eliza. 

I have not yet been able to obtain the commissions from the 
Board of War agreeable to the arrangements long since made out, 
nor doth it appear prol)able I shall soon. It embarrasses me very 
much. The officers are very much dissatisfied at the neglect. 
They think the board do not intend to fill the vacancies. 

The Right wing of the army, except the 2d Conn, commanded 
by Maj. Gen'l Greene, went on a foraging party last Saturday &amp; to 
obtain provisions for our starved army Down Past Powles Hook to 
the Point of Bergen next Staten Island, and without any molesta- 
tion from the enemy they obtained considerable foi-age &amp; some 
beef. The rascality of our troops was equal to the British. They 
plundered the inhabitants %'illainously, and I believe offered that 
violence to some for which the British arc universally condemned. 



210 

One of the Pennsylvauia line was immediately hung up for his con- 
duct without ceremony. 

You will think it strange that the army at this season should 
be stan'ing, but I can assure you that the troops previous to the 
time above mentioned, and while that party were out, rec'd no meat. 
For six days they rec'd only |- lb. pork (for meat), and that was 
taken by force from the inhabitants. They received their flour 
daily, but no meat but what I mentioned in the six days. Your 
own feeling will be too keen on the relation without their being 
aggi'avated by one who was a sharer in the distress. 

We are now in a country in which paper money is not worth a 
straw. We have notliing but what the Commissary Store affords us 
&amp; God knows that is poor enough ; beef sometimes tho' not always, 
and that very often poor, which we ought not to expect at this 
season. You must change yoirr Congress that new system may be 
formed for your army. They cannot exist as an army otherwise. 

Make my love to Mr Webb &amp; family, Peter Colt, &amp;e., James 
Lockwood, &amp;c., &amp; believe me to be yours, &amp;c. 

Eben. Hustikgton.

Camp Tappax, 1st Oct., '80. 
Dear Webb : — Your favour of yesterday's date was handed me 
last evening very i;nexpectedly, for which I thank Miss Banker. 
You ask about Arnold. I can only say that last Saturday he de- 
serted to the enemy without completing his hellish 2dot ; which 
was to deliver up the jiost at West Point. Mr. Andre of the British 
Army, an aid to Sir Henry, and adjutant General to the army at 
the Request of Arnold, went from New York to meet Arnold, 
which he did at Joshua Smith's, and there received every plan and 
return from Arnold which he wanted. On his return to N. York 
he was taken below all our first guards by two persons who live by 
plunder on the enemy &amp; had virtiie suificient to withstand every 
offer of reward he could make or any threat for refusing to let him 
pass after ho had a permit from Arnold. It was the most unfor- 
tunate train of good fortune in detecting Arnold that could possi- 
bly have happened. The particulars which you wish would fill a 



i 



211 

volume, &amp; I am utterly unable at this time to give them to _you 
correctly. Sam. Wyllys hath not been gone two hours, &amp; Ezra Bull 
lies snoring on the gi-ound. Gen'l Lincoln was not able when he 
met Mr. Phillips at Elizabethtown to agree to an exchange of 
families. I hear nothing said of a general exchange. 

Wyllys and the other officers whom I recommended are pro- 
moted and feel happy. Give my love to Betsy, Hetty, and the rest 
of your family. Tell them God bless them. I wish to be at the 
N. Branch, but I do not expect it. If honest Dick and his 
Lady are with 3-ou, let them know I remember my old N. York 
friends. 

Your gun you sent for is now at Wethersfield, sent there last 
spring by John Burnham. 

I have a great deal to say to you, &amp; had we not tlie last evening 
drank our Siceethcarts and wives in some very fine sherry, I would 
finish the sheet. I cannot add to the scroll only by once more giv- 
ing my love to the dear girls &amp; subscribing myself your friend. 

Eben. Hcntington. 

Jack Wyllys, William Walker, &amp; Ezra Bull, desire their com- 
pliments. I believe Bull is honest, tho' he is not quite awake.

^ Wetiiersfield,-!^* November, 1780. jJ'Y 

JL.J,'' /^EAR AVebb :— When I last wrote you, it did not enter my ^ 
-rtiind that so long a time would have elapsed without seeing or hear- 
ing from you ; but soon after I wrote, the Eeg' left Headquarters 
for West Point, which place I left on the Eegiment's arrival, &amp; 
with an expectation of not seeing them again this winter, but flat- 
tering myself that I should have seen Col. &amp; Mrs. Webb, &amp; Sister 
Hetty at AVethersfield, as at that time I bad great suspicions of a 
clandestine marriage, as I used to tell you when at the Hutts. 

I wish you to give my love to Betsey &amp; Hetty. Tell them their 
presence at Wethersfield is absolutely necessary to make us happy 
this winter, as to your being here, you may suppose we can do with- 
out you, if you will give us the good jieojile with you. 

Last week we began the little family dances for the winter. 
Brother Jack gave the first, a very clever one, but I must confess 



212 

it would have added much to it, to have had your company, &amp; let 
me tell you, yourself and the Circle with you are mentioned more 
than once. 

By letters from camp, I find myself again arranged in the 
army. It was unexpected, &amp; unwished for. It was unexpected, 
as I had informed Maj' Wyllys of my almost absolute determina- 
tion to resign when I left Camp, but on the second thought deter- 
mined to wait till the arrangement should take place to be left out, 
&amp; Eetire with the advantages which should be given to officers ar- 
ranged out ; as I understand the resolve of Congress, if the officers 
cannot agree among themselves to stay, the Seniors are obliged 
to stay, or rather that they are to be arranged in, &amp; must either 
stay or resign, which gives the yovinger officers the opportunity to 
retire if they choose it. I have wrote Col. Tilgham to know what 
are the sentiments of his Excellency about the resolve, as I would 
wish most earnestly to be one of those who retire, and rather think 
I shall resign if arranged in. Pray can you tell what kind of a 
corps of officers you will be ? Are they equal to the task ? I am 
very unacquainted with the 2d Regiment Corps of Officers which 
am told is annexed to yoiirs, wish you will let me know it. 

As yet I have not heard where the winter quarters will be for 
the army, but have conjectured it will be not far from W. Point, as 
that part must and will be the i)rincipal object of the enemy, &amp; 
certainly the most eligible for the remains of our army to retire to, 
not only to be near the Point for the security of that, but to secure 
itself from surprise, which it will be subject to after the Levies are 
discharged. AVherever they are, God bless them. Wishing you 
joy, ah ! Joy indeed, &amp; Eliza all that you can either ask or wish, 
I shall wish my love to your little family of wife and friends, &amp; 
subscribe myself,

Dear Sir : — As Capt. Hopkins would on his arrival be able to

Connecticut Village, 16 March, '82. 
Dear Sir : — Your favor of the 3rd Inst_ant was handed to me 
by Captain Williams. As he brought me a large packet, he was 
doubly welcome to Camp. I was glad of his arrival both on acconnt 
of the packet and 14s Company to pay him for his kindness. I re- 



ported him to the Commaud'r of the Brigade for oA'erstaying his 
furlough, in conseqaeuce of ■which he has had a hearing l^efore a 
court of inquir}' and acquitted witli honor. — His reasons appeared 
to me Sufficient, but by general orders all who transgress must be 
reported &amp; heard by a Court of Enquiry &amp; Ct. Martial, however 
good &amp; satisfactory their reasons may ajipear. 

By Dr. West I informed you of the Sergeantcy being vacant 
and requested you to apply to the Gov'o. &amp; Council, but it vrill be 
needless as Doct'r Cochran is vested with that power on your re- 
commendation to him &amp; without it cannot make an appointment. 

The business I expected to have been engaged in when I left 
Weth'd is become a matter of very great doubt to me but at present 
am not able to say how those matters will be ; whether my expec- 
tation will be answered or not. The certificate &amp; information 
about the sick mentioned in yoxir letter will be noticed, but I had 
predous thereto sent for them and all others who are to be called 
by the General's orders to join the Regiment. I have wrote Geu'l 
H. about Mr. Sands. At present we are much dissatisfied and are 
led to believe we must suffer every inconvenience that is in his 
power to inflict. Capt. Hill will be able to inform you about the 
difficulties Complain'd of which as yet we are not able to get re- 
dress'd. We expected an inteiTiew with the Secretary at War on 
the subject but his Tarry in Camp was so short that we were dis- 
appoint'd — I am happy to hear of your intended Reformation, 
which you mention in your letter is about to take place, &amp; that 
your correspondents shall not have that just reason to complain in 
future which for a long time they have had — The resolves of 
Assembly in regard to completing their quota of the field appears 
to me inadequate for the purpose if, as last Campaign they send 
dovrii their six and twelve month's men they will do essential in- 
jury — They come into the field and spend the three first months 
in learning their duty &amp; the rest of the time lie in their hiits unfit 
for duty for lack of clotliing, in hopes by their remaining in that 
situation the publick will be induced to discharge them, as they are 
eating the pro^-ision of the publick without rendering them any 
service, nor will they tho' within forty miles of their Parents and 
friends send for any clothing. 

You have nx in your Eeg't belonging to Stamford, who were 
nearly as naked as when they came into the world ; they will not 



216 

send for clothing in hopes I shall be iudueed to discharge them for 
want thereof or else giye them furlough to go and obtain it — but 
instead of that I have directed them to daily fatigue on parade of 
the Eeg't nor shall they be discharged one minute before their time 
expires on any account. I will furnish them in that way as a terror 
to those who may come after as an inducement to clothe themselves 
(for the term they engage) out of the large bounties they receive. 
Is it not possible to oblige them who inlist on the resolve of the 
assembly to be as provided with clothing as to be able to do duty 
during their service ? I have enclosed a letter to your Sister Hetty 
which you will be so good as to deliver. — Please make my compli- 
ments to Mr. Banker &amp; Miss Duyckink &amp; believe me to be yours, 

Ebes Huxtixgtox. 

I am in hopes something will turn up so as to oblige us to quit 
this Cursed Vale soon — otherwise we shall be afflicted with greater 
punishments, than an Enlightened people ought to Suffer. 
Adieu, Adieu.

Lt. Colo. Huntington's Letter. 

Wetheesfield, June, 1782. 
Dear Sie : — Inclosed you will receive a long and tedious 
sci'awl which should be accompanied with some newspapers but I 
have not been able to obtain them. Yesterday two lads returned to 
me from Camp, mustered out, one of them 21 years old, 5 feet 5 
inches high and has served two small terms in the Continental 
army, but I will not add to the subject. 

I am, dear sir. 
Your Most Humble Serv't, 

Eben Huntington. 
Colo. Webb. 

Lt. Col. Huntington's Lett'r. Wl^, A.^^UcKc^'s 
"^ Weth., 20 June, 1782. 

Dear Webb : — By Dr. Ellis I was favored with yours of the 
10th June with one enclosed for Mrs. Banker, which I sent her 
tliat even'g I received it. I am very unhappy that the recruits 



■a: 

which have been sent on liave been so bad as to have as great annm- 
ber rejected as yon mention ; there has been greater neglect m 
some of the mnstering oificers. I suspect that in myself. — Since I 
have introduced the subject of musters I would wish to suggest one 
thing which the assemljly did before they adjourned, which was 
this, that in all instances where any Recruits have been mustered 
out by the Mustering officer sent from Camp for that purpose for 
want of size, they shall be re-mustered by the Colo, of Militia Regs., 
&amp; if they shall appear to them to be fit for the duties of a soldier 
except wanting size, they are to be sent into the State Reg'ts or to 
one of the State Guards, &amp; the class shall be exempt from all fines 
or other penalties arising froui such mustering out — the Conse- 
qiience will be tliis, they will not be sent to * * , and on any 
Reci^uisition to this State for them, that Reg't will be ordered to 
join the Line, in lieu of other men, that in fact they will answer 
erery purpose to the State, as if they joined the line. 

Had directions been sent to the Military officer to be more par- 
ticular in their musters, and broke one or two of us who had been 
neglectful in our dut}', Ijetter jjurposes would have been answered, 
as the assembly would not then have taken it up with such spirit 
as to have nearly a vote for enabling the Colonels of ililitia in all 
Instances to Miister the Recriiits and to prohibit any Musters by us 
in any Instance whatever. Since receiving those Instructions I 
have mustered out those who have served two Campaigns in the Con- 
necticut Line, &amp; one of them, a very good lad who was five feet 
five inches high, and well made &amp; in my opinion a good soldier. 

By a letter from Capt. Williams to Mr. Burnham I am in- 
formed that yoii gave him some encouragement for all. If you 
intend he shall have it, the sooner the better, by an agi-cement 
among the Commanding Officers of Reg'ts last Winter it will be 
necessary that a majority of them be limited in Such Recommen- 
dation, will it not be best to recommend Sarg.-Maj. while 
at the same time, I only suggest the matter to you to think 
of, you will but judge whether your Reg't stands in need of any 
more officers. — The Government &amp; Council has filled the vacancies 
recommended last AVinter by Gen'l Parsons, have given Grosvenor 
the command of Durkee's Reg't, and ])romoted Capt. Warner to be 
Major of the same. The other vacancies are not filled, as Gen'l 
Huntington did not know who were entitled to promotion among 



218 

the subalterns. I tliiuk in the same recommendation for filling oi 
vacancies, that if new appointed officers ought to be subjoined, I 
hear that Col. Greaton, Swift and three other Ool.'s are promoted 
to be Brigadiers and so it will make a Reg't vacant for Lt. Col. 
Johnson and another Capt. to be promoted. 

Your Brother Jos. and Lady, Sister Hetty, Mr. Merrils and 
Mr. S. Chester set out for Boston last Saturday by the way of Nor- 
wich, where they proposed keeping the day of our Lord. I expect 
to get time to be at Norwich a day or two before I go to Camp, but 
at present it is uncertain. 

The wafers you mention I will endeavour to procure to bring 
to Camp with me, which will not be long hence. From the best 
information I can obtain from the different Military Officers &amp; from 
my knowledge of this County I think you may not expect more 
than 500 men from the State, as the Assembly have affixed a 
penalty of non-compliance to the act of filling up the line, of 50 
dollars only, which is less than has been given in many instances 
for bounties and whenever the penalty is less than the boTinty to be 
given, you may rely on it they will spare the purse if they Damn 
the Country, besides, they save themselves the trouble of looking 
for soldiers. As the women appear to be more zealous for recruit- 
ing and keeping iip the army than the men, I have proposed to 
some of my friends that the lasses should have the liberty to hire 
women, and that I will not be so strict as to their measiire, as I am 
sure in the present distress'd situation of the army a Court Martial 
could not be convened who would censure me, tho' at the same 
time I would recommend that tall girls be procured that the ofE- 
spring may be five feet six inches high. 

I have tried your Patience and Will close with Compliments 
to my friends with you. 

Yours, 

Ebex Huxtixgton. 
Colo. Webb.

Dear Webb : — Your favor dated Weth'd with enclosed by a 
line dated from Gen. Greene, was handed me by Eichard. It was 



219 

highly acceptable but instead of the cover I wish you had delivered 
it yourself and spent a few hours with me in my solitary Hutt. 

As to hay, my horses are fasting as well as yours. I have sent 
out but can purchase no hay— neither hard nor soft. Money will 
fetch it. 

Being on duty to-morrow prevents my waiting on my friend 
Moylan. The paymaster will attend on him agi-eeable to the time 
mentioned. 

I much wish a few hours with you. I wish to say many things 
to you, &amp; must before you go to Amboy. If you will be at head-

EAR Colonel : — Desirous to hear from my friends and rela- 
tions, likewise to receive any support they might have sent by you, 
I have desired . the bearer to wait upon you with this (as I under- 
stood by Colo. Bull that it was uncertain whether you would be 
permitted to come to the Island) to receive either money or letters 
if you cannot come. 

AVhen Mr. Jos. Webb was in New York with the flag I received 
neither money nor letters, which if should now be the case I am 
certainly to be pitied. I received from Mr. Munford a small sum "^ 
to procure a few things that I was necessitated "for, but at present 
am clestitute and am indebted for making a few shirts. Mr. Riley 
lives four miles from me but I saw him last Thursday. He was 
well and very desirous of seeing or hearing from his Colonel which 
also is the ardent wish of your AdJ't.

Flatbush, 19 June, 1779. 

Dear Coloxel : — I enclose this as I shall every opportunity 
that offers to write the person whom most I sincerely esteem and 
respect. The Colo, must not expect from his Adjutant's letters, 
the ease and elegance of a Chesterfield, or the eloquence of a Chat- 
ham, but that he means to inform the Colo, (as far as his situation 
will permit) of many things that have transpired in Limbshire 
since his absence. 

A list of Characters has made its appearance. A, is suspected 
for the A — th — r. On Gilded Chariot wheels, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. — 
It's whispered near L ve L n that a great personage who 



lately left Limbobush has broke off all connections with a noted 

house in Amsterdam. A certain young Noble xi who sometime 

since made his appearance in this city has withdra^vn from the cor- 
ner of L vc, L n, in consecuence of its not being allowed 

that he'd an elegant head of hair. 

Last Tuesday Capt. Bulkey, Mr. Eiley and myself had several 
gentlemen to dine with us of the Colo.'s acquaintance, in the fields 
near my quarter. Believe me I may say with propriety that a table 
more clegently furnished has not made its appearance in Limbolusli 
for this centui-y past. There was fifteen invited but only ten came 
which made the glorious number of thirteen. By desire of the 
jDresident I here enclose a copy of our proceedings copied by the 
secretary to the president. Mr. B, &amp; both of the Mr. C's were 
invited but for reasons very obvious did not come. Mr. Fitzhugh 
&amp; Randolph present their most respectfull compliments. They 
would have wrote, but they say its customary for gentlemen who 
leaves this, to first inform their friends they leave behind where to 
direct to them. Major Giles, Capts. Goodale, Fauntleroy, Willis, 
Willing, with Mr. Robins, Hall, Bender, Lloyd &amp; Bradford present 
their compliments to the Colonel. 
Dear Colonel, 

I Still Remain your

Boston, Feb. 11th, 1787. / 

My Dear Webb : — I received your two favors, for -which I am 
indebted, and hold myself reprehensible at a moment where many 
objects of a military nature and therefore of imijortance were press- 
ing so close upon me as to leave not even leisure to pay a debt 
greatly tho' not often due from me again in the same way, &amp; the 
oftener the more you will evince your friendship. I promise never 
to be so far in arrears. 

I told Hetty what I had wrote you and she was hurt on the 
same point I find you evince. I will not again offend your feelings 
on this head but leave it to its own operation to determine whether 
you or myself know what we are. Your sister says we believe the 
same thing of. each other — That is we both suspect the weakness of 
the other in a certain matter while each is Sure of his own strength. 
It was extreme goodness was it not, for a young lady to advance 
even to a something not short of a declaration to you because she 
conceived the happiness of him She declared in favor of concerned. 
This no doubt was the real situation and such tenderness though 
imsuccessful yourself you must needs admire. The expedient shows 
resoiirce of mind, and I hope it has succeeded to every one's expec- 
tation. Their will be done. What can I do ? They will not write 
to me. Do they speak to you ? If so, ask one who looks the best 
natured towards me, if you dare, to write me why they will not 
write. At the same time my correspondence is at an end. Not 
with you. 

Yours, 

E. H. 

Write me by every conveyance.

Boston, February 18th, 1787. 
Dear Sir : — -I received your favour of the 11th instant last 
evening wliich proves to me that you do not wait on such occasions 
for the etiquette established among the more ceremonious but less 
friendly. However, wrote you in answer to yotir former favors the 
instant I had it ayiveniently in my power. Considering the facility 



witli wliich yoii write, you are, let mo tell you, very blameable for 
not gratifying oftener a sister who thinks much too highly of your 
merit. What she possesses is reflected on 3-our thin visage and 
shows it, no douJjt to greater advantage. Barrel sa3-s you are a 
promising young man. 

The Reliellion is nearly crushed, but the heads of it do and 
will remain for, God knows what period. From the nature of our 
Constitution, the people, where little refinement or knowledge is 
introduced, have imbibed principles which nothing but fear will 
effectually eradicate. This paves the way for standing armies— and 
they in time of peace mfree andpojndous cities are dangerous. 

The lovely fair I have not -s-isited since my return, but her in- 
quiries after you have reached me, as it has many of your friends — 
among which believe me. 

Sincerely, 

E. Haskell. 

Recollect me to Doctor Bailey.

My Deak Sir : — Yours I have, dated the 20th ulto. If you 
were Minister of the United Netherlands or in any other public em- 
ployment, or in private keeping, you could not appear more in 
haste than you commonly do when you write any of your friends. 
This I believe commonly happens with people in your and my 
situation. To sit down in a cool, formal deliberate manner to an- 
swer a letter to a friend is what I seldom do ; but wait until the 
last moment and then am compelled to scribble in such monstrous 
haste as renders it almost unintelligible. This will be a proof in 
point. 

The Dulcinea of your affections in this quarter appears every 
day more amialjle and attracts universal admiration. Her public 
appearance at the last assembly was beyond description elegant. — 
She is a charming girl — she sings, plays upon the liarpsichore and 
dances — to use the common exj^ression on beings so perfect — di- 
vinely. I spoke to her of you. You are a ha])py man if you would 
but imjirove the favourable opinion she entertains of you. 



224 

It is improbable the Troops from this State will mai'ch soou &amp; 
for the Westward Spriugtield &amp; Berkshire. 

Your sisters are well, and uncommonly well pleased at your in- 
dustry of writing nearly two lines in their favour, or about them 
rather.

Since my return, Dear Sir, from the country where I was de- 
tained much longer than I intended to have been, your favors of 
the 20th May &amp; 2d June, were handed to me. Your polite inten- 
tions to Major Ewing he expressed to me yesterday and lamented 
the weather was such as prevented him making with you a visit to 
the several strong grounds and fortifications in the vicinity of New 
York. 

Xot long since there was a probability of my visiting your city, 
Avhich I have now altogether given i;p the idea of, or if I do, it is 
at a distance from this period. Boston will be my place of residence 
during the warm season, not of necessity, but of choice, where I 
shall expect you soon. Since my return only two days ago I have 
not seen Tyler. From him I shall leam your mischief, and I 
promise you that the most illnatured use possible shall be made of 
it unless you in person communicate that jiart of it with which he 
is unacquainted. Barrel I saw yesterday, who tells me no altera- 
tion has taken place at his house. We conversed of you and both 
wished it had been to you. There is a rage for politics and arms 
existing in Boston, tho' in everything there prevails a violent op- 
position. Xow is your time to visit it. I continue a spectator in 
all things, and it will be an improvement to have such assis- 
tance. 

All the artillery of party rage is levelled in the House of Re- 
presentatives, but insurgency, though it bellows loud is silenced by 
the well directed fire of two governmental pieces, Sedgwick and 
Parsons.

BosTOX, July 22d, 1787. 
Dear Webb : — You talk of settling down eitlier in Georgia or 
the Ohio, or elsewhere upon some well chosen spot, with so much 
seriousness, that I am led to believe my lecture has been received in 
earnest, and you are now profitting by its doctrines. I seldom 
preach, it is true, but I shall be led into the practice of it if I begin 
by reclaiming you. This would be the more agreeable and effected 
with greater facility if you would place yourself down by me where 
I could join example to precept. And as encouragement to tMs, if 
such it is esteemed, I promise to accompany you to Portsmouth, 
Xewbuiy or Salem. The last place I would of choice avoid for my 
friends sake. They might put you upon proof of being flesh &amp; 
blood and you know their mode of determining cases of sus- 
picion. 

"Coiirting of fortune," I have no more to tlo with her then 
with vice which I studiously avoid as I wish to have that fickle 
prostitute at my disposal. Blind, like those she lavishes her favors 
upon, while we poor devils which know how to estimate their 
worth, and are left destitute, may then be left at the disposal of 
the Cincinnati, who I hope have their eyes open. 

Your Sisters were well last evening and not violently abusive 
of you. I endeavoured to place your neglects in the most con- 
spicuous view with an intention not so much to injure as to supplant 
you in their esteem. The family predjudices were too firmly fixed 
to be in the least moved by this kind of proceeding. 

Little as you may deserve it they are better pleased witli your 
praise than to hear you censured.

My Dear Sir : — May the single be married, and the married 
happy, is an old adage to which thou hast tossed off many a bum- 
per. In which class I am to rank thee, I know not (for it is niatter 
of speculation) but in either or both I wisii thee felicity. I have 
not had the honor to be much acquainted with the Fair one who 
has attracted thee, but what I did know of her excited me earnestly 
to wish to know more, nor has that wish siibsided. I thought I 
discovered in her an agreeable Blending of Gaiety and pensivencss, 
of frankness and reserve. Such a commixture cannot fail to pro- 
duce that delicate medium of character, conduct and disposition, 
which must give felicity to and receive it from a Man of Honor and 
Sentiment, &amp; with which therefore, you must be happy ; Ijc you

morrow afternoon I take that opportunity of informing you of our 
safe arrival after a passage of three weeks. I have not yet had time 
to deliver your letters, Ijut you may depend upon it I shall make it 
my particular lousiness to wait upon ]\Ir. Seagrove to-morrow. 

Your brother is out of town. The tediousness of my passage 
will prevent my making any stay here, &amp; you may expect me in New 
York by the middle of 3Iay, and even till then appears almost an 
age. You know what a powerful magnet attracts me there. I find 
that I am absolutely in love. You will hardly be able to read this 
scrawl, but the hurry of a public house in which I have not been 
above half an hour, must plead my excuse. 

Adieu. Believe me to be with the utmost regard.

Dear Sir : — Lord Stirling's servants are all sick, and have 
been so for some time. He desires me to request of you the favor 
of a careful, trusty, non-commissioned officer or soldier, for a few 
weeks, who is capable of providing for a table that would admit a 
few friends, and who may be entrusted with those little concerns, 
which, though not important, are very essential to happy existance. 
His lordship asks it as a favor in 3-ou to send him such a man, 
either from your regiment or from the Brigade you command. 

Your horse is in very fine order and in pasture with our horses. 
He can remain with them as long as you please.

Xancy Johnson's Letter. f^ ' '^^^" i'i^U^ 



J^\y^ Stratford, 15th July, ITTO. 

The assurance of the continuance of yonr friendship, Col. 
Webb, gave me satisfaction, as my esteem for you remained un- 
altered. I have even from the first, lamented your disagreeable 
situation in being a prisoner, and wished you to obtain an exchange 
as you desired. I now congi-atulate yon in being once more with 
your friends, and hope you will no more be obliged to leave them 
to live among those who must be disagreeable to you, since no one 
can have all their wishes gratiiied in this world. We must endeavor 
to be content with what we can obtain. We have need of much 
philosophy to bear with tolerable patience the disagi-eeables of this 
life. Religion alone can support its in real calamities. The only 
way to Ijcar present ills as we ought, is by extending our views to a 
better world, and hoping future .good — 

' ' Tliat generous hope, whence every joy belongs, 
Its spirit draws, and every pain its balm." 

Is it not folly in a high degree, to give it for any advantage 
here, where all is varying, uncertain, and unsatisfying ? 

Our situation in these Towns along the sea coast is very dis- 
tressful. I know your generous, feeling heart will pity the un- 
happy sufferers. Mine bleeds for them. Oh destructive War ! ! 
barbarous fury of inhuman Britons ! may Heaven defend us from 
their rage ! Terror and anxiety torment my mind. 

Had it happened to be convenient to you to pass through Hart- 
ford, your friends here would have been glad to see you. 

Miss Walker and our family desire me to assure you of their 
friendly rememljrance and good wishes. 

They all were glad to hear of your return from New York. 

I sincerely wish you happiness Colo. Webl), and with real 
esteem am 

Your Friend, 

N. Johnson. 
Colo. S. B. Webb.

Nicholson. I have done all I could on the occasion which was to 
write a very urgent request to the justices to give every assistance 
with teams and forage that Eichard Bacon should apply for. I 
have requested them to forward it here with all possible Despatch,

may be received. 

Colonel Hughes is gone to Albany ; I cannot therefore give a 
positive order on Major Campbell or Keese who is at King's Ferry

for me from your Brotlicr. I mentioned to Mrs. Lawrence the 
treat you frequently gave me of them at your social breakfast table, 
and we are anticipating with pleasure a repast of the same kind this 
summer. I know your punctuality and politeness, and I should not 
have taken the liberty of reminding you of yoiir promise, but from 
the knowledge that your attention is a little more circumscribed by 
a favorite object. 

I shall send my waggon to K"ew Windsor tlie latter end of next 
week, when you will oiilige me by sending it there so that I may 
bring it from thence by that conveyance. 

Mrs. Lawrence joins me in compliments to you, &amp; believe me,

My horse was sick and I was obliged at length to leave him upon 
the road and hire another. 

Upon my arrival I found a verj- tasty wig that the Post from 
Hartford had left for me hearing of my return, which I have worn 
once or twice, that, when I return to Cambridge, I may not be an 
absolute stranger to myself. It fits me admirably well and my own 
people are pleased with it, and say it becomes me the best of any I 
ever wore. To you, sir, I am indebted for this, and hope I shall 
have tKe pleasiire the beginning of next week, of personally acknow- 
ledging the Keceipt of this Token of your friendship.

Tho' I have the pleasure of an agi-ceable wife and pleasant 
children around me, yet I am at Cambridge sleeping and waking, 
impatient to know every manceuvre. Will you gi'atify your friend 
by writing a few minutes of what has passed in his absence, in doors 
&amp; out, and sending it by the present Post. 

Jlr. Baylor, Aid-de-Camp to General Washington, had an 
horse in my keeping, which I have sent down according to his de- 
sire. Will you be so kind to see that he has it. 

Give my duty to General Putnam, my most respectful compli-

N. York, April, 1779. 
Sir : — In conversation with the Gentlemen Prisoners yester- 
day on Long Island, I found they had a desire that some of the 
principal officers from their body should attend the Commissioners 
to Amboy, and gave for reason, that, should any objections arise on 
part of General Washington's Commissioners, he might have in- 
fluence enough to obviate it, provided they should be in an error, 
which is quite possible may be the case for want of thorough know- 
ledge of our situation and circumstances. I cannot but be of opin- 
ion it may be attended with good consequences, and am certain it 
can be no injurj-. General Thompson who is a man of weight and 
influence would be the proper person should j"ou join me in opinion, 
be so obliging as to name it to Sir Henry Clinton or Lord Rawdon 
in doing which ymi will confer an obligation to tlu^ ]irisoners on 
Long Island as well as sir.

disagreed in the very first proposition made by us, which was to

be assented to on your part from a resolve of Congress which was 
to be implicitly adhered to ; this being the case, we parted without 
doing the least business. As to your obtaining leave to go home on

resolution not to let an officer go out, until those return that are

etter from the American board of war, a copy of which I encloses 

l)y which you will perceive, sir, that I am with Major General dc 

Reidesel at liberty to renew my journey :ind to go into New

an account of my being detained. He immediately set out for (Hen-

a ])rinciple of honour that lieing suffered to visit his friends upon

Colonel Webb's arrival at headcuarters a few days ago he was in- 
formed by the American Commissan' General of Prisoners that a 
summons had been sent to him and others, the American Oflicers 
Prisoners of War requiring their immediate return to New York in 
consequence of order from your Excellency. This by no means can 
lessen CV)loncl Webb's propriety of conduct, and I have further to

Manor of Livingston', June 23, 1788. 
Dear Werb : — From the late rains Mr. P. has been detained 
at the Manor till this day, and now the roads will detain us some- 
what longer, for which reason I shall be prevented from attending 
the meeting of the Honorable order of the Cincinnati, as I must 
attend to them at Lake George for perhaps the last time of our meet- 
ing, but I shall be with you as soon as possible after my return, when 
I expect you will be able to retnrn with me in the new chair I am to 
exchange for my old one. Sec to this. Give my love tf) Mrs. 
Coventry &amp; Betsey, tell them I long to see them. 

Adieu, 
"^ Yours, sincerely, 

(ien'l S. F&gt;. Werr. Henry Livingston.

D"k Webb : — Nothing has as yet been done in our Business. 

You have heard no doubt of Gate's resignation. I was present 
when he delivered it to the meeting at Farmer's Hall in this city. 
At first I was not a little surprised. But our politicks have taken a 
different turn, and I hope for the better, if it is not too late. 

Mr. Jay is come forward as a Candidate for Governor. It 
meets with the i^nanimous approbation of all with us. The Patroon 
is in Nomination for the Lieut. -(iovernor's Place. Old Governor 



Cortland is ruilM niiil intends to opiiose him. Clinton's party will 
support liim. .lay will carry almost all Wt'stchestcr, and in my 
opinion, will have a decided majority in the Southern District. 
J&lt;]vcr\-thing now dejieuds ou yonr exertions to the northward. The 
friends of Yates in the Legislature seem detei'inined &amp; unanimous in 
support of Jay. Mr. Burr is also held up as a Candidate for (iov- 
criior. He and his friends are both in earnest. But I cannot con- 
ceive his interest is a powerful one. Indeed I am at a Loss to de- 
termine whether he will prove most injurious to Clinton or Jay. 
Clintoji &amp; Burr havi' hoth started c'X)ires8es to every part of tho 
State. 

I hojie Mrs. Wel)l) and the little lady lately arrived, are in per- 
fect health. Present our best respects to her. Please to remember 
me to yfiur Father-in-Law &amp; Capt. Ten Brook. Our friend the 
Treasurer shall l)e carefully watched by

T,i. Col. W. S. Livino'ston's Letter. 
/ CL^ Beverwyck, July U, 1782. 

^C^^/^^Deau Webb :— Your letter by Corporal Knott, of the 7th I 
received yesterday, and believe me, I have not read one with more 
pleasure this long time. The fricndl}', social style in which its 
wrote, the delicate manner in which you rebuke Mr. Lott and my- 
self for a want of attention, and the strong ideas of friendship with 
which it has impressed me, bring to my mind the pleasing remeni- 
bi-ance of past times ; aiul while I read the charge, am made doubly 
hap])y ))y the conscious innocence of both. Our business, as you 
nuiy justly suppose, was extremely urgent, or the hospitable hut 
of our friend wmild not have passed unnoticed. We did not spend 
one night in camji, the connuander in Chief dining during the day 
we passed througli with General Howe, gave us an oj)portnnity of 
l)aying our respects to ])oth at Robinson's House, and the same 
evening we crossed at Kings FeriT. On our return, as fortune 
Would have it, we met Jackson, Grayton and a nundjer of my old 
acquaintances there, whom I was extremely happy to see ; and 
eirald I have brought you, by some magic spell, within the social 
circle of the labli', with inclination and desire, all eons])ired to 



240 

jirompt my memcn- to effect it. This circumstance alone was 
wanting to have made my happiness on that occasion complete. 

I shall at a future day (at present it will be improper) let you 
know the pui-})ort of our errand. At a futiire day, I hope (and 
without it who could live) to enjoy free from restraint an unin- 
tenipted intercourse with all my friends. But witli the circle of 
AVethersfield most particularly. 

Did I dare at this time to communicate my wishes fully, I 
could add, and with the sincerity of a friend, that I hope to see the 
day when the restoration of yoiir almost irreparable loss may be in 
. part made up to you, by a hapj^y connection with one, who, either 
from a participation with you of her friendship, or merit similar to 
her predecessor, may be fit to represent her, and interest those affec- 
tions, which are worthy of, and fewer still dare attempt to claim. 
Yon call me friend and sign yourself the friend of Livingsttm. Be in 
return the centre of my affections. Point out the source in which 
they ought to ilow, bestow them most, where most you give your 
own ; and my constant study onlv shall be to make the fount inex- 
haustible. Let me only request that this family, as they ever wish, 
may ever claim a double portion of your esteem. Return, if you 
please, the love of all here to good Mrs. Bancker and your friends 
at home. Let mine when an opportunity offers lie particularly 
communicated to Hetty and through her, to our friends at Boston. 
AVc hope Mrs. Bancker may soon again enjoy her health, and wc 
most ardently wish that ycm would come and spend some days 
with us. 

Were we to choose, I shoukl say Months and if it were agreeable 
to you, I extend it to a home where all the arts to please should lie 
cheerfully exerted that are in the power of 

Dear Webb, your sincere friend 

And Obd't Servant, 

AV. S. LiVINGSTOX. 

P. S. — Kemember me to the Oentlemen of the regiment, and 
in a particular manner to Capt. Bulklcy whom I much esteem.

Look at the direction of the enclosed, and if it does not jiro- 
VUuce a train of the most agreeable sensations. I will never forwanl 
vou another. Fortvinate man, to be thus blessed with the affections 
of one of the first of her sex. It is not the characteristic of a bene- 
volent mind to be envious of another's hapjiiness, but situated as I 
am, I eoulil wish to shake hands with yon under similar circum- 
stances. 



248 

I lU'cd jiot assure you liuw sensible I am (if tlie confidence 
Avhieli you have placed in me, and how ready I shall he to oblige 
both yourself and the Lady ixpon every occasion. I am sure you 
are sufficiently convinced of my friendshi]! ami dis]iosition to serve 
you. 

I have not had it in my power, from the constant duties in the 
field, tt) assist Major Claiborne in forwarding the Avine. I will 
write him upon the subject, and press him to forward it. 

The Enemy continue precisely as they were, and they have 
comjjleted a bridge of boats across the sound, but whether the}' 
mean to retreat or make a daring and serious attack upon our army, 
I cannot say.

AVednesday EvENixf;, 11 at night. 

Deai; "Webb : — Your letter by Mr. Chapman was just handed 
me owing to my being out of the way. .1 feel not only a wish, but 
a compulsion to write you a few lines at least, as I have a perfect 
sense of your hapjiiness on its arrival, though T am sorrj- to say I 
have nothing nuiterial to inform you of. 

Mr. AV. this day has returned ; goes again in a fortnight. The 
Misses, &amp;c., have since your departure Ijcen much to themselves, 
they this day and evening are in preparation for to-morrow night's 
Assembly. 

The said foot is not yet perfectly recovered, and 1 much fear as 
long as there is any dancing there can be no cure. 

I have not been there as much as I could have a\ islied or you 
expected owing to my repainting my shay so that I might paint it 
independent of the frost. AVhat think the Miss's have drank tea 
with Mama in a sociable way. I waited on Miss W. last Saturday 
to take tea with Mr. J. AVats, she behaved as a true friend to me, 

but not a word of the and I was not to know it. Lewis's bag- 

affc leaves this in the mornino'; if vou are there on their arrival voti

in very good quarters, viz.: Col. Worthington's. Now, if I could

which they anticipate with much satisfaction. 

Your })rother Jack has sailed, l)ut there is siune tloiibt whether 
he left Xew London before Monday last. I nearly forgot to inform 
you of our passage from Xew York to Xew Haven. We left the 
former on Saturday morning and got no further than Whitcstone. 
Mr. and Mrs. R. King, Mr. and Mrs. Lovcl, Mr. and Mrs. Jervis, Mr. 
Broome, another lady, whose name I do not remember, and men

Deak W ebd: — ^\"ere 1 to write you a letter as long as you de- 
serve, I must devote more time to you than I can spare from my good 
father, whose stay with me is very short, ami the whole of that must 
be engrossed by business. I have snatched a few moments from 
the busy scene to devote to you, to thank you for your kind remem- 
brance of me, and to assure you of my regard — secluded from all 
my former acquaintance, and even my retirement broke in upon by 
misfortune, you must ever consider yourself as performing a deed 
of charity to write nu'. I sJiall ever remember your polite and 
friendly attention to me. 

Well, Webb, are you nn)st marrieil J' ^ly faj:her has dropped 
some hints about a certain young lady at Claverack, a very hand- 
some girl, tho' I am informed that she is not sound in the toes ; 
get her sound that she may last, for it is the devil tn be corn- 
fed. 

We are looking anxiously toward Boston for the fate of tlie 
Federal Constitution. A\'e daily see many fine sensible perform- 
ances from that Convention, and I doubt not that the wisdom, a^s 
well as the property of the State, are in favor of it ; but, unfortunate- 
ly, every lihickhead and bankrupt in theiState has as good a vote as 
abetter man. Should Massachusetts adi)])t the Constitution, lilmdi'

Island and New Hampshire will follow t\u- oxanii)k'. 'J'lic Judge 
tells me that Xew York will adopt it. God send it succcsf\ Pre-

see her. I am, dear Wehl).

HohiTl .Morris. .Inn.'s, Letter. 

Westchestek, .May 15, 1780. 

Dear Webb : — '^'our attentive letter to my liajjpiness was last 
evening handed me by papa, and received my warmest thanks for 
your uniformly courteous C(mduet through the ]ieriod of our ac- 
quaintance, however warm yet, methinks, mutually sincere ; and 
this, your letter, is not one of the smallest marks of your concern for 
me and mine. This old Goshenitc must have made no small stir 
among my relations in town — one very laughable for you, a silent 
inspector of their conduct. Mother must have sniggered a little 
if credited by her make notes Wel)l' — for I am sure no memory 
can contain all. 

I am up to my neck in business, and have scarcely time to write 
my friends. I am sorry to inform you that old Black is infinitely 
worse than any four-footed beast I have ever come across. He 
makes nothing of visiting his neighbors three miles around to taste 
their hay ; my hay I have got for him is verj- bad. I am necessi- 
tated to turn him out in the day-time. I have at length procured 
an easy ])air of iron hol)bles, which kee])shim very (juict, and I am

writing, you will not be offended.

Your iiiisvortunc in I'lilliiig tlmmgli the ice was greater than 
your loss of reputation as a steady young man, greater tlian you 
suffered in health by drinking good wine, and even exceeded any in- 
couTcnience from that " Busy dog Cupid." Indeed falling into the 
water will as well cool one's courage this extended season as the 
lover's leap over a DO foot jirecipice. I don't say the acre would be 
as ])ermanent. 1 liowever did your messages faithfully. I drank 
tea with B — y, 1) — s. I do assure you the rememln-ance was acccp- 
t.djle — a blush suffused itself over that lovely face, &amp; tlie lire of 
Heaven liardly is jnore dazzling than her Eyes. 

The other object of your particular attentions J — y, K — x re- 
ceived with ;i diffident smile the favourable mention of her by 
Colonel WeVib. "Impossible he should think of nie. It must be 
my sister" — with a hesitation as if she feared I shouldn't recollect 
my mistake. I w isli lliesc were all tlie ini])ressi(ins you have given 
or received. 

Affairs at Ten Hills are in a sail Irain and \inir li-iejid must 
Pink Morris, suffocate himself with (lie smell of tar (jr twist a 
si rand or two (jf tar and hang himself. Lucky for me, however, 
if I can transfer my affections &amp; sip the sweets from flowers 
promiscuously, oi' if you please can buzz like the diligent bee from 
Pink to Rose and anon to the violet, though could 1 meet with a 
real honeysuckle, I could draw the sweets for life. A sly fox this 
Morris and an old soldier, for whilst I thought he was nianceuvreing 
on the banks of the N. Kiver or the Dee, he carried on his opera- 
tions on Charles River. Cod bless her, I lielieve she is a good girl, 
but I am not sufficiently acquainted to know her merits ])ersonally. 
1 shall never love her less for being Morris, Mrs. Weljb or any other 
mistress. 

I must re]ieal ujy acknowledgements to you anil the Captain 
for your kinil invitatiims. If I come into the vicinity of your 
mansion or quarters, some very uncommon circumstance must occur 
to ]&gt;revent my calling upon you the first in my list. 

We had the must lirilliant assembly last evening that has lieen 
known for many years; Such a blaze of beauty almost over- 
]»oWH'red the senses. Poor little Innijcents — not a soul of them put 
on their holiday countenance to harm anv one, not a soul of them,

opening a correspondence with me. I shall persecute you with

deals blood and slaughter around him, whilst the old and new Em-

chat, decent hilarity &amp; the Eevolutions of the tea table. But to 
business. You may as well attempt to snatcii dear Polly from S. 
Nicolson as get his Canteens, and I suppose his promise was at a 
gay late hour.

My Dear Sir : — This acknowledges yonr fav"rs of 9th &amp; 21st 
Feb'y, which jieldcd me a real pleasure ; for, without flattery my 
dear Col., there seems to be such a soldierly frankness about you, 
that I regret my not before having an intimacy with you, and am 
determined in this way to redeem lost time. You judged rightly 
about the canteens. Either Brimmer wanted them or other induce- 
ments made him oppose the sending them, at least this my conjec- 
ture upon recollecting some reluctance in this matter upon the oc- 
casion. At any rate all my persuasion was vain. Nicholson is 
married, gone to sea, &amp; to my mortification my friend is disap- 
pointed. 

By tlie way, after my compliments to Maj. Burnet, let him 
know I liave uot received a letter he refers to in his of 7th 
Feb'\', but will do all possible in compliance when I see it, but 
he will observe the clothing to be drawn Ijy the stafE must be from 
the»Clo'r General or sub-clothier upon the certificate from tlie 
principal, of which by recurring to tlie resolve of November lie 
will be convinced. 

Your commission to the sweet girls have to my utmost exe- 
cuted. Pretty villains, just calculated to plague mankind, unless 
the}' have experience enough to play tlie old soldier. 

What a genius is Morris. He makes love to everything 

pretty, but I think N y has him fast. I like it well. There

On the present Expedition, 'tis of ye first Importance to the suc-

that the most exact order &amp; Discipline be observ'd ; and the Honor of 
// our Armj &amp; the Righteousness of our Contest, will be made manifest 
to the World, &amp; our Enemies by the regular &amp; orderly Behaviour 
of the Officers &amp; Soldiers. 'Tis not from any base &amp; mercenarj- &lt;^/

we draw our Swords, but from the Koble &amp; /fenerous Principle of t «. . 
$/ maintaining the Right^of Humanity, &amp; vindicating the Liberties of 
' Freemen. The officers &amp; Soldiers are therefore, most earnestly ex- 
A/ horted &amp; Strictly Comm^ded, to forbear all Violation of Private c 
Property. Not the least article is to be taken but by order^. We ' 
are to convince our Enemies we despise their Practices'&amp; Scorn to 
follow their Example ; but should any Person be so lost to all 
Virtue &amp; Honor, as to infringe this order. He or they, may depend

Dear Sir : — On my return home on Saturday last I received 
a letter from Mr. Bondinot, desiring me to meet him in the 
Jerseys. 



266 

I set out Monday in the storm, and on m}- way to his house, at 
a little village called Chatham, about ten miles from Morristowu, 
I had the pleasure to see and dine with your younger brother, Cap- 
tain of Light Horse, who was very well, and in high spirits ; glad to 
hear so straight from you. He set out Thursday last with his troop 
of horse and many others to join General Gates at Fishkill. 

I returned this day, and have brought snndi-y letters for the 
officers, all which I enclose to you, requesting the favor of your 
delivery of them. I enclose you also some newspapers. I would 
rather you should not mention this to certain people who are apt 
to take umbrage at everything and make mountains out of mole- 
hills. Your brother did not write, Ijecause I could tell you he was 
well, and would have been improper for him to write more. 

I can give you no further news about the exchange. Mr. 
Boudinot informed me that he knew nothing of the particulars, 
having only received a few lines by express from General Washing- 
ton, acquainting him that General Howe having proposed a general 
exchange, to which the Congress had acceded, his presence became 
necessary at camp immediately. I parted ^vitli him at Princeton 
on Thursday morning, when he set out for the camp and I for 
home. 

Major John Beattj-, late your fellow prisoner, is appointed by 
Congress to succeed Mr. Boudinot as Commissary of Prisoners, and 
he accompanied him from Princeton to camp. 

I came in a flag boat with a load of flour, which will unload 
Monday, and prevent me the pleamre of paying you a visit ; but you 
may expect to see me as soon as I can possibly spare half a day, 
being, 

Yours, sincerely, 
Colo. Webb. L. Pin-taed.

X. York, 19th June, 17T8. 
Dear Sir : — I huve this minute received a letter from Major 
Beatty, who has been in town by the brig near two days, dated 12th 
inst., in which he says : Mr. Boudinot with myself have at length 
settled every difficulty with regard to an exchange. Mr. Loring, 



267 

who will pro'oiibly arrive before this reaches yon, will inform you of 
the particulars. You will be kind enough to inform the gents on 
Long Island of this agreement, who I flatter myself will all be at 
liberty in a few weeks. The flag is detained for my answer to the 
Major's letter, and therefore I can only add that I am 

Your Very Humble Serv't 

L. PiXTAED. 

Please to inform Mr. Clarkson that his chair is safe in my 
stable.

Col. Popham to Doctor Vruoman. ^^Ux^/V^u Uft&amp;6- , 
Xeav York, Dec'r 30th, 1787. 

My Dear Sir : — Your letter Ijy the last post was received, 
and your orders respecting the muff have been attended to, but 
hitherto without effect. Kitty has the charge of the business, and 
is as industrious in the pursuit as the nature of the other more 
momentous concerns will admit. 

I sincerely congratulate you and your good family, on the event 
which is likely to take place in a little time. I have conversed 
freely with the *Geueral on the subject, and have found him can- 
did and generous as I expected. He has declared his attachment 
for fKitty in the most unequivocal terms, and his most serious and 
honorable intentions. I can therefore have no donljt but that in 
due time a union will ta!:e place ; and from my intimate knowl- 
edge of the man, I have every reason to believe that she will be a 
very happy wife. 

This, I believe, will be accompanied with a letter from him to 
you on the subject, which I flatter myself will be satisfactory to the 
family. I have received a letter from Judge Hogeboom, which I 
should have answered, Imt by the interruption of company I must 
defer to another post. I beg you will make my best respei 
him and Mrs. Hogeboom ; tell them I must sincerely congratulat(" 
them on the pleasing pi'osjiect of seeing their daughter happily 
united to a man of worth ; who, in the estimation of all his friends, 
possesses every qualification to make a woman happy. 

*Gen. S. E. Webb. 
"t.Miss Kitly Hogeboom. 



268 

I cannot close this letter without observing that this gentleman 
is a native of Connecticut, of genteel conversation, pleasing person, 
agreeable manners, and as far as I can understand, in independent 
circumstances. He is at present in no business except that of set- 
tling the estate left him by his late wife ; he is about thirty-two 
years of age. Thus endeth the first lesson. 

Wishing you the compliments of the season, 

I am, yours, &amp;c., 

Wm. Popiiam. 




Major-General Phillips (British) to Col. H. B.Web:). 
^ IS'ew York, Dec'r 3d, 17;9. 

/V'tco *AS- Sir: — I ta!^e the opportunity of a flag going to Elizabcthtown, / 

A, ^«to inform you that I am arrived hero among my friends ; and as my 
'^ /''/'time, as you will naturally conclude, has been hitherto engaged in 
receiving the civilities and attention of my friends, I haA'e not had 
an opportunity of entering ujjon business of any kind. I do not, 
however, forget the conversation we had on the subject of ex- 
changes ; and I beg leave to repeat to you that I shall be extremely 
happy to be instrumental in forwarding so desirable an object for 
both armies. 

You will please to remember that you promised on your I'e- 
turn to the American headquarters, to mention to General "Wash- 
ington our jdeas on the subject ; and you assured me that I should 
hear furthef from you relative to this business. I shall be very 
glad, as I mentioned to you before, to meet, with the consent of 
Sir Henry Clinton, any gentleman recommended bj' General Wash- 
ington, to talk with upon these matters at any time, or in any 
manner most agreeable ; and when I have the satisfaction of know- 
ing that this measure will be adopted, I will then ask General Sir 
.Henry Clinton's commands to enter upon the subject of exchanges 
with such gentlenien. This I shall do with much pleasure and 
A./ cheerfulness, beginning it as a matter of private conversation first, 
which may hereafter be resolved into a public discussion, should 
our ideas on the subject fortunately happen to coincide, and that I 
obtain Sir Henry Clinton's consent upon the occasion, whom I do 
not intend to trotihle upon the aSair until I hear from you. 



209 

It ^vill give me great pleasure if, throiigli your aud my means, 
any measi^res should be adopted which may tend to the relief of 
captivity on both sides. 
- I am, Sir, 

with much personal respect, 

your most obedient 

most humble servant, 
W. Phillips. 

Jabez Parson's Letter. /7&gt;W. fCo^eCLos 
Hartford, 6th April, 1T81. ^ 
^^ 1/^ Dear Colo. : — By the enclosed papers yovr will see my deter- 
mination which has been unaToidable. I have therefore only to 
express my feelings on the occasion which are unhappy. Having 
had the honor of serving under your order with the gentlemen of 
your Eeg't adds much to the natural regret I feel at leaving 
service, and the polite treatment I received from yourself will 
endear to me the memory of that short and happy portion of 
my time, and for which I request you to accept of my warmest 
thanks. 

Having had the misfortune of wounding myself will prevent 
my coming to the Reg't sooner, for which reason I have to request 
a recommendation from yourself to the Commander-in-Chief for 
my dismission. This I wish to be done as soon as may, as it will 
be a matter of delicacy at the opening of the campaign. I should 
have sent sooner but had no opportunity. 

If you think proper to mention my being disabled from doing 
marching for some time by my wound I shall be glad, though I do 
not offer that as a reason. I shall come to the lleg't as soon as I 
find myself able to settle any matters that may be necessary. 

Should be very happy to have my dismission forwarded to 
Hartford, and lodged at the printing office. 

Request my respects to Major Wyllys and officers of the Reg't, 
and should think myself obliged to have an opportunity to divide 
with any my rural fare. 

With a glorious and immediate conclusion to the war, and an 
honorable settlement with the army. 

Am, with the greatest respect, 

Colo. Webb. Jabez Parsons.

Eichard Piatt's Letter. 

Xew York, Dec. 8tli, 1790. 
Dear Sik : — Colonel Smith took passage iu the last packet 
for England, and previously resigned his office of marshal, that is 
to say, he informed the President of his intended departure, and I 
think, without doubt, he will appoint a successor. If you think it 
any way worthy your notice you will, of course, make application 
to the President immediately. 

I hear nothing from you about certificates nor of Pompey— the 
latter you should return, and the former I think you should not 
lose sight of. 

With compliments to Mrs. Webb, 

I am, Dear Sir, 

Your friend and obed't serv't, 
Gen'l Webb. Rich'd Platt. 



Kichard Piatt's Letter. 

New York, June 19th, 1791. 
Dear Webb : — What has become of you for so long a time ? I 
wish much to see you — why cannot you come down and pay us a 
visit ? Everybody will rejoice to see you, but at present the most 
of your friends say you are dead. Come down and convince the 
contrary soon, or perhaps they will not believe you if you delay it 
much longer. 

Besides and above everything else, my good friend, I want you 
- here on the 4th July next ; you must come and stay with me, and 
go to Eockaway afterwards. 

I am, with sincere regards, 

best wishes for Mrs. Webb's,

Gen'l Webb, Dear Sir : — Amongst the sons of misfortune 
who are totally ruined by Dner, McCough and "Whippo, I am to be fVi.a-CC'u^l 
ranked. I wish you will come down as fast as possible and see me. 
I have in hand stock to face any note to you. This is right and 
just, as I conceive your money lodged in my hands as if deposited 
in Bank, subject to your draft at pleasure. The like is the case 
with Sargeant Giles, Cincinnati, and Ohio funds, which are sacred 
in my hands, and the calalmity is so general that it is impossible to 
tell you wlio will or can stand. I think it my duty to come to a 
full stop, and this event will take place to-morrow. This, my old

SiR : — From the present appearance of affairs there is the 
greatest probability that some officers will be permitted to go out to 
Philadelphia on the subject of an exchange in a few days. As you 
are equally interested in the subject, your interest with Congress 
and presence is wished for, and could you be in Philadelphia 
about two weeks hence it would, perhaps, answer a valuable 
purpose.

return I am i-esolved to be better than mine. You have not had 
time it seems to write whether you are well or ill, happy or other- 
wise. You know by experience my situation affords a few nic- 



273 

ments to inquire after my friends. As such I embrace this oppor- 
tunity to enquire how you are — how you have been — and how you 
have passed your time, &amp;c. 

We go on in the old way. The weather being remarkably fine, 
walking with the fair sex is the principal amusement, That night 
I sat an hour with one of them who lives near the centre of this 
city, as iisual she was chatty &amp; agreeable counting the days of your 
absence and the hours before you return. I did not then know of 
this opp'y or would have had messages, compl's, &amp;c. The flower 
you were to send me is not yet come to hand. 

Mrs. Bainbridge whom I was with last evening begs you will 
apply to Gen'l Washington for a passjaort to visit her children &amp; 
friends in the Jerseys. She says you will confer a lasting obliga- 
tion on her by obtaining the desired permission. 

We have heard nothing of the exchange. I am afraid you have 
not succeeded. If so you will be the Bearer of the first letters after 
the receipt of this. Adieu. God bless you, don't let me see your 
face again in Flatbusli.

Phillip Schuyler's Letter. 

Clavekack, 20 February, 1788. 

Dear Feiexd : — I arrived here on Wednesday last and have 
spent my life since that in a continued round of dancing and dissa- 
pation. I could wish you were here to partake of my pleasure and 
the company of a certain lady whose behaviuor to me has been so ex- 
tremely kind that it never will be in my jiower to cancel the obliga- 
tions she has conferred ujion me. 

If you was not well acquainted I should undertake to comment, 
biit even that would be the height of presumption in my feeble 
feather ; since the pen of a Hamilton or a Chancellor would be in- 
competent to the task. She is truly noble, and if you are serious and 
accomplish your undertaking, if you don't spend your time attended 
with extreme Iiappiness in a connection with her you ought to be 
damned into an eternitv of eternities. 



273 

I now set out for Albany accompanied by a nuniliur of tine g'n-U 
from Hudson. I have followed your example, and paid some atten- 
tion to indifferent individuals. 

Dame Fame has got it in the mouth of her extensive trumpet, 
and make no doubt, but the next news you hear concerning me is 
that I am engaged to Miss Olney. Yours joins with me in present- 
ing our best respects to you. Pray give my love to the Misses 
Rutsen whenever you see them. I can't inform you anything con- 
cerning the old affair yet, as I did not stop at Poughkeepsie longer 
than the stage changed horses.

delphia &amp; Baltimore by water and returns through York to this 
place. He is a son of John Sargent's, and about "^1 years, and 
though he has never before been from home, is I think an accom-

I have given him a line to Clarksim &amp; Piatt, and should have wrote 
to you by him, but that he was in haste and I intended introducing

ilajor Wintlirop Sargent's Letter. 

lOth of August, Boston, 1787. 

I liave enjoyed, my dear Webb, the pleasure of seeing your 
friends at Wethersfield and in this town, who all anxiously inquire 
after you &amp; have long been anticipating a visit. Your Brother Joe 
&amp; Mrs. Webb paid every ci\-ility &amp; attention to Doctor Holten &amp; 
myself. 

Haskell is still here, &amp; witli myself paid his compliments to the 
Commodore of the French Fleet at this Port who is a very genteel 
man. The Chevalier Du Quesne &amp; several others of the officers 
wear the order of the Cincinnati. If you can make it convenient 
to come here while this fleet continues, you will find some addi- 
tional amiisements perhaps, b^it indeed &amp; seriovsly I expect to hear 
of you at the Road attracted there by our fair water nymph, &amp; upon 
my honour I think her charms sufficient to invoke in her Train 
men less in Love than yourself. By my heart Webb I wish you 
indissolubly tied to the object of your pursuit, because I think she 
possesses all your affections, &amp; that you are capable of making her 
hajipy, but I will drop this subject. 

You must not, you will not I am sure, forget occasionally to 
mention our wishes as to Ohio appointment amongst those gentle- 
men of Congress with whom you are acquainted — particularly such 
as may have arrived in York since I have left it, &amp; it will be proper 
to talk a little with Mr. Smith, &amp; I beg of you to present me occa- 
sionally as your otvti propriety of judgment may dictate to him &amp; 
the other members of Congress to whom I have the honour of being 
kno'svn. 

If George Turner is with you, present him my regards ; I shall 
write him on the subject of a small memorandum he enclosed me as 
soon as I have satisfaction on that jioint. 

Eemember me most affectionately to our worthy friend' Piatt &amp; 
others who may do me the honor to bear me in mind &amp; believe 
me. 

Ever yours, 

W. Saegent.

MoxDAY, 14th of Jaii'y, 1788, Boston. \ 

Samuel ! Samuel I 
Where art thou "? 

Twice, my good sir, have I wrote to you of late, and without 
a word of Reply. Are you so much engaged at the corner that 
you cannot spare a moment for your friend. Well, I wish you 
hajipy, &amp; you know I have given it as my sentiment that those in 
your mystic circle are to be your Felicities. 

How are the good Ladies ? do write me, for I feel myself inde- 
pendent of your Worship, affectionately interested in the welfare of 
that whole family. I regretted very much that in my late visit to 
York wc could not pass together sotrq of our Time with him. When 
I am next with you I hope it will be otherwise. This is to be about 
the middle of February, &amp; perhaps sooner. However, it will depend 
upon General St. Clair from whom I shall hear previous to my 
journey, as be has promised to write me from New York. Is he 
there ? 

I shall be well pleased to be situatsd near you — you know the 
quarters I would like, and I will ask you to look out for me. It is 
not probable that I shall remain in York longer than two weeks 
almost. 

Accompanying of tliis are six maps which I request you will 
dispose of agreeable to the List here annexed. Don't forget that I 
mean them as a compliment, so that if you meet with the names in 
your list of subscribers you must observe that what I now send on 
has nothing to do with the business. 

I saw your Brother Barrell yesterday — who desired (jf me to 
write Piatt concerning the Interest on our Certificates paid for 
Shares in the Ohio Company. Will you be so obliging as to tell Piatt 
that the subscribers generally would be very glad to receive them 
at this time as they can now negotiate them to great advantage. If 
he will foi'ward Butler's, May's, Jackson's, Downer's, May's &amp; 
mine, I will be responsible for them to him. 
I am your affectionate,

six maps ; one for yourself, one for Gen'l Thoron, one for St. John, 
one for Capt. Hutchins &amp; the other two for Bauman &amp; Piatt. 

I intend being in York about the middle or 20th of next

there — on my way to the Western Country, where, my dear Fellow, 
I wish most sincerely you would go on leave to take a look at the 
country, &amp; if you have not business to engage you here, it will 
really be wise disposing of yourself, &amp; you will receive more satis- 
faction than at this distance you may promise yoi;rself. 

I shall stay about two weeks in \"ork &amp; should like to have

Dobb's Ferry, 25th Dec'r, 1782. 
My D'r Webb : — You are too well assured of my friendship 
to attribute my silence to anj-thing that can be injurious to the 



280 

sentiment upon which it is founded. The true reason is, that I am 
so pressed. Front, Flank &amp; Rear, with official business, that my pen 
is constantly employed. I have not since I saw you, had the least 
intermission, but have been confined almost as closely by Mars, that 
Harsh murdering deity of war as I formerly was by. the God of 
LoTC, who assisted by his mother, spread the silken net with an en- 
chanting grace, &amp; proved more successful in his capture than I be- 
lieve his intentions were entitled to. However the Little Villain 
being almost conquered, I have re-enlisted under the banners of 
Mars, &amp; shall continue his faithful soldier as long as he keeps 
them displayed. 

Under whose shadow should I conquer or prove 
I'll rest — Superior to the arts of Love. 

I find myself nxnniug into sucli a singular train of thought 
and cxi)ression, that I must check m3-self by pursuing the Laby- 
rinth ; I shall not only involve myself, but lead my friend into 
difficulties from which we may have trouble in extricating oiir- 
selves. Therefore, altering my phraseology, I shall in as plain 
terms as the English language will at present furnish me with 
what I iuteiided ah origine, Imprimis — damn it, 
here creeps in Latin, what will yoii expect next. I think I hear 
you say with the sprightly Frenchman — Vive la Lafayetfe — well 
agreed. For it affords them much mirth &amp; as allies what makes 
them laugh should at least in us produce a grin. 

I will, however, attempt to inform you of that which I intended 
when I sat down should be the subject of this Letter. It is that 
the prospect of accompanying you to Connecticut has vanished. I 
have expressed a wish to the Gen'l to be relieved, but he strokes my 
back with the idea of command, &amp;c., and thinks I had better stay, 
to which you know I must submit. Inclosed is a letter for Dady. 
If j'ou visit our friends shake the males by the hand, salute the 
females for me with your usual delicacy, and tell them it is the 
present I send accompanied with the compliments of the season. 

I am, D'r Sam.,

UirXL. qAcU" Dear Sam. : — A long time it is,siuce I haye set Peu to paper to 

w fli/Vtf- write to any of my friends,' therefore you'lj not think yourself neg- 

lected by the omission. ^* j&gt; 

And now,' what shall I write yon but a sorrowfnl^account of my 
misfortunes \rhicli^I may truly say.have kept pace with the calami- 
ties of my country. Not long since I was bereft of the partner of 
my wishes, since which, the little representative which slfe left be- 
hind^ and which seem'd some consolation to me imder that irre- 
£ pai-able loss, is snatch'd from me, and I am left as it were, alone, 

^ to bemoan my hard fate. v» .» » 

^^T^ou see, my dear Sam, that I am obliged in thi* early periods 
of my life to drink large draughts of the bitter cup. This may at 
least serve as a lesson to teach us^not to depend'too much on any- 
thing in this life, since it is but temporary and everything in is at- 
Si^e/L, tended with ' muoh uncertainty.* AVliat prospects Iliad/ for what ^ 
the world calls happiness, you well know. How are they cut off 
and vanishS^ in a moment from my view. What further misfor- 
tunes may fall to my lotC^time will "ait^lwse whatever they are, f^''^'^'*) 
or whenever they may come, I hope to have fortitude sufficient to 
bear up under them as a man, and if I do it as a good one 
hapjiy for me. 

This theme, my dear Sam, although a melancholy one, pleases 
me to dwell on, and knowing your good/nature, and having a claim 
to your friendship, I take the gi'eater liberties in laying open to 
yoi;r view the sorrows of my heart ; when you and myself used to 
occupy my little South Cliamber, we knew no troubles, all then was 
/ ^. smooth, easy and joyous_j' ^ow is the scene chang'd not only with . 

me, but even with yourself^ -fhcw we take a retrospective view of id "W 
former times and compare them with the present^ ^hat an odds_; CC- 
— where are all our dreams of happ)iness flown/^ ^ime has slid i ^ 
away, and we have not as yet catch'd the phantom which was pur- / 
jl ^ sued- ^he still eludes our eager gi-asp"; and plainly tells us, 
she IS not to be possess'd by mortals in tins life.— .Fix, my dear 
Sam, your views beyond it, and let's no longer trifle in pursuing 
pleasures, which, when possess'd, lose their delights in the moment 
of enjoyment. [_ OrUMi Hu. ^/AZ pL^t trfi ^^ in-tl-tyi^i.tr^ •

\ Phila., :2D.MarA 1780. 

Dear Webb : — I thank you most cordially for your letter of 

JL the 20th ulto., as it convinces me that my friend Webb has not en- 

wQ'^^^^tirely forgot there was such a person as Seagrove. I can readily 

* */ excuse your not answering my two letters while prisoner on Long 

^/ Island, as it might have been attended with disagreeable conse- 

• [uences to you should the enemy have known it. Believe me, Sam, 

more of the very disagreeable scenes I have gone through since we 

parted, has not in the least lessened my esteem for you, and it 

will ever add to my happiness to hear of your prosperity. 

I hope that you are again a true man. I mean that you 
are exchanged, for if I am to believe report, you are more a 
captive than ever to that dear sweet girl Miss B — my old ac- 
quaintance. Indeed we have it here that you and she are one. 
I cannot think it or surely you would have mentioned it. In your 
next pray empower me to contradict or confirm it. Tlie latter will 
be most agreeable. 

As I am a prisoner of war on parole to tliis State, I cannot 
promise myself the pleasure of seeing you or the ladies in Jersey, 
and when the poor devils taken in Cliarlestown arc to be exchanged 
I know not. 

I am sorry to inform you that Baron Steuben left this ten days 
before I rec'd yours, and is now with the army in N. or S. Caro- 
lina, and I cannot find any persons here to settle his affairs, I now 
inclose the letter you sent for him. 

I had few lines from Jos. Webb a few days since which gave 
Hie pleasure. Please present my best Respects, Love and Compli- 
ments to Mrs. B— Aunt Polly, Miss B — or Mrs. W — C, and Miss 
Webb, who I understand is witli you. 



284 

Euken desires his compliments. He sails in a few days for 
France. Constable is with onr army in Virginia. I shall be glad 
to hear from yon/and when you come this way I exjject to see yoi\ 
to talk over the days Ave have seen. 

I am, 

Dear Sam, 

Yours, afE'y, 
Col. Webb. J. Seageove. 




James Seagrove's Letter, '■^v?, t\.(\/i ^u^^&lt;, 
PniLA., 25th March, 1781. ^ 
Dear Webb : — I have receiv'd three of your favours, the last dated 
the 9th Inst., and am truly ashamed of my indolence in not hav- 
ing wrote you before, but so it is. When a man has not anything 
to employ him, he contracts those habits which on reflection give 
him jiain, and make him appear inattentive to his friend. Tho 
more than probable I should have sum"d up resolution to have given 
you a line before, but the want of anything much agreeable or in- 
teresting has in a great measure prevented — and sorry am I to 
think that at this moment I am equally destitute. News siich as it 
is we have in abundance — but little dependence can be placed in 
report — certain it is we are on the eve of important events. 

Lord Cornwallis &amp; Gen'l Greene within a few miles of each 
other, both acting with miich caution and their force nearly equal, 
if any odds Greene has it. Arnold at Portsmouth entrenched with 
ab't 1,500, or at most 2,000 men. The French fleet gone there 
with 1,200 Grenadiers — the Marquis Lafayette 1,500 Lt. Infantry. 
Gen'l Guest 500 Continentals from MaryF, and ab't 4,000 Vir- 
ginians under Mulenberg &amp; Werden— are the force to attack him. 
Those with the assistance of the shipping I think must do his busi- 
ness. Hope and wish they will attack him without delay, as we 
have much to fear from the arrival of the British Fleet from Gar- 
diners Bay with the late embarkation of troops from New York. If 
we are so fortunate as to capture Arnold and push on 2,000 good 
troops immediately to Greene, Cornwallis must fall, as he is up- 
wards of 300 miles from Charlestown, &amp; 200 from any seaport. His 
advance into N. Carolina, was in my opinion rash &amp; may prove his 
ruin. The "uar between England &amp; Holland no doubt will be in 



285 

favour of America in general, but individuals feel it very severely. 
This town has already lost by the capture of Ft. Eustacius not less 
than half a million pounds hard cash, and I am sorry to say that I 
contribute to this not less than £2,000 Sterl. 

I am afraid I shall be puzzled to get j'our ptjrt wine and Ijecr, 
but if in town for sale you shall have them &amp; the corks by way of 
Trenton to go from thence in a wagon which brings up some goods 
of your neighbor Jno. Shaw who is the bearer. Enclosed you have 
one of our late prints for you and the lady's anmsement. Please 
present my best regards to Mrs. Webb, Miss Webb, Mr. Banker 
and Aunt Polly ; nothing would give me greater pleasure than to 
pass a week with you and them, Ijut remember I am bounded by 
the Delaware. 

I am to thank Jos. and you for the care of my mare, as I am 
totall}- unhorsed, and the pleasant riding season coming on I shall 
he obliged if you will send her here to me by first safe hand with 
what expense you have been at. 

Colo. Mayard is at Lancaster forwarding on his regiment to tlie 
southward. I know not whether he goes on or not, I should think 
not as his Eeg't is but small at present. 

We are in momentary expectation of interesting news from 
Greene and the Marquis. God gi-ant it be agreealjle. 

I wish you health and hapjjiness, and am with expectation of 
hearing from you by every opp'y. 

Dear Sam., 

Your afEec't friend, 

Col. Webb. James Seaokove.

My Dear Friexd : — A few days past I received a letter from 
a friend in Xew York, acquainting me of your Ijeing a ])risoner on 
parole on Long Island. Be assured, my good friend, this I was dis- 
tressed to hear, and especially as I have been unfortunately absent, 
when a person whom I highly respect, and am under numberless 
obligations to, perhaps stands in need of a friend's assistance to 
lighten captivitj&gt; but on consideration that can scarcely be supposed 
to be the case with vou — for the general good character which vou 



28G 

have established, exclusive of extensive acquaintance in New York 
and Long Island, miTst make your time pass as agi-eeably as the 
situation can permit. I wonder at your not writing me. I heard 
of a Oolo. Webb being taken in the sound, but was informed he was 
of Stamford. Believe me Dear Sam, I wish to see you, for which 
purpose I shall pay a visit to New York next month, and in the 
meantime, should you stand in want of cash, please call on the 
bearer, Mr. "William Constable (Partner of Jno. Porteous &amp; Co., 
Hanover Square, New York), who will deliver you what you re- 
quire, and I will reimburse him here. You see I make no ceremony 
with you and exjiect none on your part. I have much to say when 
we meet. We have very late news from England — things seem as 
if we should have peace in America. 

I shall expect a line from you as soon as possible, and am, 
Dear Sam, 

Your Friend &amp; Humble Serv't, 

Col. S. B. Webb. J. Seagkove.

Dear Webb : — I hope this will meet you returned from the 
eastward and in good health and spirits. I am happy to inform 
you that we an-ived safe at this tovra the sixth day from the Wharf 
at New York, all in health. I find everything agreeable beyond 
expectations and only want you and a few more of our friends from 
the northward to make us very happy. 

Jack Webb does not yet appear. I am by no means uneasy as 
to his safety — as the weather has been unfavorable for his getting 
in. Besides I think it probable he did not sail so soon as he in- 
tended. It is unfortunate the people are not here. I am torn to 
pieces by the people here to engage them a preference of our car- 
penters. I could employ 100 every day. Peace is concluded and 
firmly settled between the Indians and this State, and we have five 
of their Chiefs as hostages. Jack of coui-se will immediately go on 
his land on the River St. Mary's, which I find (since it has been 
surveyed) is considered as the very best tract in this State — Major 
Armstrong and myself will accompany him. Mrs. Bard &amp; Mrs. 
Pendleton are well- The former intends changing her name on

When you write to Connecticut give my love to all our friends.

My Dear Colo :^I am happy in the opportunity of telling 
yon that the result of the last negotiation of Exchange, has pro- 
duced a letter from Gen'l Lincoln to his Excellency Gen'l Washing- 
ton, who means to refer it to Congress. I think this the Critical 
Moment. I shall set off to-morrow or next day for Phila. with the 
despatches from Headquarters on this important subject &amp; conld 
wish to see you before they are delivered. I am sure much dejjends 
on the success that may attend them, and your weight &amp; influence 
with Congress is of the utmost Consequence. 

The enemy are thi-eatening to send the Privates to Halifax or 
West Indies, but say nothing of the officers. God only knows what 
may be their fate ; it may be worse than it is, but their present 
situation is intolerable. I need not say any more. Your own feel-

And has sent him under cover a Philadelphia paper of 21st ulto., 
just received by Miss Schemerhorn from Morristown, containing a 
piece under the signature of " 2}Jai)i triith," being strictures on the 
address of common sense to Mr. Dcanc, which he thinks a very 
candid, masterly and unanswerable ^performance, much to Mr. 
Deane's credit, and highly exposing the author of common sense 
which it's more than probable Colo. Webb has already been furn- 
ished with, as it's of an old date. However should he not it ^ill 
give Mr. Seaman pleasure of sending the Colo, any papers that have 
a tendency to remove the prejudices that have been attempted to 
be raised against the character of a gentlemen so nearly related to 
him as Mr. Deane. 

Mr. Seaman was extremely mortified that he happened not 
to be at home when the Colo, was kind enough to call and see 
him when last in town, and hopes the next time he will not be 
deprived of that happiness. The ladies join in Compliments to

Mr. St. John presents his compliments to General Webb. He 
feels himself much honored by the General's very polite attention 
to the French nation through him. Mr. St. John's short residence 
in this city has not yet given him an opportunity of knowing all 
the gentlemen of that nation who may at present be in this city, 
and therefore he cannot, with propriety, point out to General Webb 
such as may be worthy of the compliment the General means to pay 



292 

tliem. The Chevalier D'Aboville and his brother, Monsieur 
D'AboTille, are the only persons who Mr. St. Jolin can at present 
mention to the General. Mr. St. John is sorrv that he was not at

Major Benjamin Talmadge's Letter. 

^r*^ UpPEE DrBLI&gt;r, XEAB Gekmaxtowx, / 

\ Nov. 13th, 1777. ( 

Deae Sib : — Eetired from duty a moment, I am set down to 
give you the current news of the day, the whole of which summed 
up amounts to but little ; so that, on the whole, this letter will 
contain subject matter for erjiectation, rather than of past occur- 
rences. 

The noble defence lately made at the important post on the 
Red-bank you have doubtless been ajiprized of. By a gentleman 
from Philadelphia I am told that nothing could equal the mortifi- 
cation and disappointment of the enemy on that repulse, as they 
expected but little resistance would hare been made, and on setting 
down and counting the cost it has been the amount of about five 
hundred men to them. 

The greatest preparations are making by the enemy to attack 
our forts both by land and sea. They have cut down sundry small 
sloops, which are to carry one or two heayy guns, and float over the 
chevaux de frise. These are preparing below, near Fort Chester. 
Above the fort, and at the city, they have built floating batteries, 
which, with the Delaware frigate, is to pull down and attack the 
gallies on that quarter. A 6 gun battery of 32 pounders has been 
lately opened on Province Island, which fired about 200 shot the 
first day without wounding a man of ours. The plan proposed (if 
accounts be true), is that the shipping and batteries should play on 
the fort incessantly, and if possible dislodge our people ; this fail- 
ing, they are determined to storm it. How difficult a job this may 
be they will be better able to judge when they make the trial, but I 
rest in hopes they wiU not succeed. Everything almost depends on 
our maintaining those forts, and unless they can obtain them it is 
evident their visit ^■T^hiladelphia can Ije but of short duration. 



293 

In front of their army is a chain of redouts, connected together 
by a continued piqnctt or abattis, from river to river. Thougli 
they are formidable (I mean the redouts), yet if they draw off much 
of their force to act below, I hojJC and tliink the General will try 
the strength of them. 

A constant tiring is kept up Ix'low, and we in turn are almost 
everyday taking off their piquetts advance in front of their works. 
Gen. Potter with one brigade is on the other side of the Schuylkill. 
General Vamiun has crossed the Delaware, and lies on the Jersey 
side, and the main body of the army, with his Excel elncy, is in 
the rear of Germantown. Thus you have the disposition of the 
arm}-, which in this part is encamped in two lines, from which we 
defy General Howe with double his number of Invincibles to drive 
us. Colonel Livingston, I am told, is a prisoner. Unfortunate 
man ! I pity him much, but his amiable lady more ; because I 
really believe she i\ill be more concerned for him than he feels for 
himself. His zeal for our cause, and determination not to hear it 
ridiculed may, perhaps, bring him into trouble, but his connec- 
tions in New York and the British army will be of great sernce to 
him. 

Make my compliments to Major Huntington and all the 
officers of your regiment. If my old friend David Humphreys is 
with you, give him also the benediction of 

Your friend aud humble serv't, 
Col. Webb. Besj. Talmadge. 

17th Nov. — I am sorrj- to inform you that we have just re- 
ceived intelligence that our people were yesterday obliged to evacu- 
ate Fort Mefflin, having sustained a very heavy cannonade for many 
days, both from the enemies batteries and shipping. I am told that 
we brought off most of the cannon and stores ; wish I could 
give you the particulars, l)ut am not able, as the news has just 
reached us.

opportunity which I long wished for of exposing the Jesuitical con- 
duct of a man who has rendered himself odious in the eyes of every 
honest man. After answering the questions proposed by the House 
we had the opportimity of laying before the House sundry letters 

signed by General W h in behalf of the Committee, which 

being designed for answers to questions of moment proposed by 
your Committee, we were not able to find any meaning or honest 
principle in them, and of course (to the great disappointment of a 
certain person) we laid them before the Assembly as a sample of 

the candor with which, under the auspices of W h, the 

settlement was like to be conducted. Unfortunately, the Assembly 
were as miich puzzled to explain the letters as our committee. In 

the pause of our obseiTations before the House, Mr. W h 

was handled sometimes without mittens. Indeed, the House, I 
believe, suggested that his objections to ovir proceedings were 
rather captious than otherwise. I have not seen their last resolu- 
tion in consequence of our application, but I am told they have 

taken all the staff officers into the Con 1 Line and excluded 

the general officers, ^his appears to be an odious distinction, but 



295 

I am convinced the Generals will do better with the Continent 
than this State. I hope we have now got almost over embarras- 
ments. 

Since you left us we had an agreeable Ito}) at Mr. Lockwood's 
A choice collection of ladies attended. As usual, the number was 
rather too gi-eat. 

We hare no news of moment from the Eastward. Our Assem- 
bly rose last Thui'sday. If I should attempt to tell you what busi- 
ness they had done, I should be as long in telling you what they 
needed; as they repealed almost the whole acts of the session. "When 
you reflect that every paragraph of a bill can be delated and passed 
the House, and then the whole be nccjatired, I need not enter into 
a more particular description of their proceedings. I am told they 
have determined to make good the £10 notes issued in '77. Of this 
yoii may take advantage, and I wish you would purchase as many 
as you can find in your travels for yourself and me. Some of them 
have doubtless hoQu carried into N. Jersey, and the possessors would 
be glad to get rid of them. 

Make my compliments to General Green, Colonel Huntington 
and friends, and be assured that I am 

Yours sincerely, 
Col. S. Webb. Bexj. Tallmadge.

Major Benjamin Tallmadge's Letter. 



Jk^j.^ Ceampoxd, July 6th, 1780. 

^ t I / Dear Sir : — Since my arrival at camp (which was on the third 
^^ day after I left you), a variety of avocations has prevented my writ- 
ing to my friends as often as I could have wished. 

I have just returned from Il'dqu'rs at West Point, where I 
found and left yoiir brother Jack in health and happy. 

Since the arrival of Sir Harry from Carolina, and the alarm 
which spread thro' the coi;utry in consequence thereof, on acc't of 
your fortresses on the North River, I am haj^py to assure you that 
our afiairs at the garrison wear a promising aspect. Much credit is 
due to the State of Connecticut for their exertions in forwarding 
supplies, and I believe more to Governor Clinton for the seasonable 
reinforcement which he sent to the fort. From a government so 



296 

modelled, and a Governor so zealously engaged in our cause, every- 
thing ■uithiu the reach of human exertions may be expected. Did 
you not know the spirit of the Constitution of this State, and 
particularly the powers of the Governor in military matters, I would 
relate to you some of his proceedings toward the militia in the late 
alarm, where pecuniary satisfactions will not atone for breaches of 
military orders, and the rich are obliged equally with the poor to take 
their tour of duty or suffer military sentence and execution, no man 
hopes to escape, and of course all are willing to assist. 

General Washington has retired or advanced from the Clove 
down to the Kachet 'tis said on account of forage. 

We have this day been informed that the French fleet have 
arrived at Rhode Island. God grant it may be true, as I long to be 
in a more active sphere. I am to-morrow going on an enterprise 
down to the Line with a very respectable command of horse or foot. 
I hope the next account you hear from me may relate some achieve- 
ment.

Dear Sir : — I must acknowledge the receipt of yonr two 
favors of the 12th and 16th inst. ; am sorry I did not receive them 
in season, that I might have liad the pleasure of seeing you on your 
way to New Jersey. Benton has gone into New York with the horses, 
etc., agreeable to your request. 

You have doubtless heard before this of the rascally conduct of 
Arnold. He has gdue to the enemy, where I think his miser)', 
which must ensue, will be complete. Poor Andre, who has been 
under my charge almost ever since he was taken, has yesterday had 
his trial, and tho' his sentence ig~not known, a disgraceful death is 
undoubtedly allotted to him. By Heavens ! Col. Webb, I never 
saw a man whose fate I foresaw, whom I so sincerely pitied. He is 
a young fellow of the greatest accomplishments, and was the Prime 
Minister of Sir Harry on all occasions. He has unbosomed his 
heart to me, and indeed, let mc know almost every motive of his 
actions so fully since he came out on his late mission that he has 
endeared himself to mc exceedingly. Unfortunate man ! He will 
undoubtedly sufEer death to-morrow, and tho' he knows his fate, 
seems to be as cheerful as if he was going to an assembly. I am 
sure he will go to the gallows less tearfu.1 for his fate, and with less 
concern than I shall behold the tragedy. Had he been tried by a 
Court of ladies, he is so genteel, liandsome, polite a young gentle- 
man that I am confident they would have acquitted him. 

But enough of poor Andre, who, tho' he dies lamented, falls 
justly. lam happy to find he has wrote to Sir Henry Clinton, in 
which letters he speaks highly of our treatment towards him, and 
takes oif the idea of his Ijeing under sanction of a flag when he was 
taken, which has been told by Arnold to Sir Harry, that our con- 
duct in punishing him might be censurable. I think his letter to 
General Clinton will effectually ruin Arnold with the enemy. 

Jos. Smith, an accomplice with Arnold, I also l)ro't on with 
rae ; he is now under trial. 

Of news we are entirely bare. I conclude 4^ are so taken uj) 
with the agreeable prosjiect of connubial life that you can hardly 
pay attention enough to read a letter from your friend — a man who 
Avould not risk anything for such a Banker would deserve never to 



298 

be liappy. All must approve your choice ; but you only will be 
benefited by the bargain. God bless you, and if I belicTed she re- 
membered me as well as I do her, I would send her a thousand 
compliments. 

To your i^isfei' Hefty please make my compliments, and to any 
person of my acquaintance. 

In haste, believe me 

Your friend and most 

Obedient servant. 
Col. Webb. Bexj. Tallmadge. 




Major Benjamin Tallmadge's Letter, ^'h^. ai-^^CU.*, 
ToTOWA, November 4th, 1780. 

My Deae Sir : — Capt. Webb this moment informs me that 
there will be an opportunity to send you a line to-morrow. 

Since the new establishment of the Army has come out in gen- 
eral orders the head ofiBcers of the difierent lines have been very 
busy fixing upon those who command new regiments for the war. 
The provision for the retiring officers is so ample that I am sorry 
to say there seems to be an emulation among our Eastern officers 
who shall go home rather than who shall continue in the service. 

After the great pains General Washingion has taken to provide 
some honorable compensation for those officers who retire, for their 
past services and sufferings, such a requital would wound him very 
sensibly. However, there is a check upon them, that no one can 
retire with the benefits iiromiscd until the new regiments are com- 
pletely officered. 

I am this afternoon informed that the field officers of the Con- 
necticut line have been together, and that Col. Wi/llys, Col. Sunft, 
Col. Weih, Col. Meigs and Lt. Col. Sherman are ijrojjosed as the 
commanding officers of the new regiments. Was I to give you my 
opinion, I should advise that j'ou immediately repair to camp, for 
the purpose of assisting in comjDleting the arrangements. There 
are many things, such as the rank of a regiment, the field and 
other officers arranged, &amp;c., &amp;c., which would be well worthy 
your attention. I am informed this day by some of our officers 
Just exchanged that j'ou are at lengi:h liberated. I hope it may 
be triie.

299 

I intended, when I crossed the North RiA'er, to have rode as far 
as Princeton before I returned, and of coiu'se I should have called 
on you. A letter from the General of this day, on particular busi- 
ness, obliges me to return to-morrow. 

It is said there is another embarkation taking place destined to 
Virginia. 

Col. Sheldon is very honorably acquitted. You will see his 
whole trial in print. 

Please to make my compliments to Mrs. Webb and your diil- 
cinea, if she remembers me. 

In a few months, according to custom, I shall expect to hear 
by line from you. In the interim, 

I am. Dear Sir, 

with friendshiii and esteem.

Col. Webb. ' Benj. Tallmadge.

New York, 20th June, 1778. 

Dear Colonel : — I received your favor of this day, and was 
veiy Sony that I could not have the pleasure of waiting on you with 
Mr. Shaler, by reason of attending the General. Since I saw you 
have waited on General Prcscott and Colonel Campbell and men- 
tioned your affair. You may depend on it, they are inclined to 
serve you. Colonel Campbell acquaints me that he has received no 
answer from Sir Henry Clinton as yet, but every day expects one, 
and nothing can be done till then. Nothing could afford me greater 
pleasure than your company in the Flag, which will most probably 
sail on Monday or Tuesday next, and will endeavor, if possiljle, to 
see you before we sail. Am very busy now in packing up Govornor 
Franklin's things. 

I am, Dear Colonel, 

Yours, &amp;c..

should not suit, return it and have it altered.

My Dear Friend :— The stage driver informed me that he 
had put a letter in the post-office for me from you. This informa- 
tion I did not receive till this afternoon. I called at the office this 
evening and the Postmaster was absent. I know not the contents 
of your letter, but I will attend to it in the morning. Goodrich has 
not received his examination, and I am fearful it will not take 
place till the last of the week. My business I will accomplish to- 
morrow, but I shall be in duty bound to attend to Goodride, and 
wait until he gets his examination. 

Pray don't leave Claverack till after my return, which will be 
on Thursday or Friday. I hope }-ou have taken possession of one 
of my rooms, or all. "My love to my dear girls.

Ciijitain Jnsrph "Walker's Letter. 

Hartford, Gth Feb'y, 1780. 
'AR Sir : — By way of apology for not writing to you before, 
Hch I should have done had I not been informed you were on a 
tour of pleasure at Boston, therefore, you would not get my letter 
veiy soon ; should have wrote by the last post had I knomi of your 
being at home. Ilowever, let what I have now wrote, and my em- 
bracing the earliest o])portunity since to convince you it was not for 
want of attention. 

I left the regiment the sixth day of last month, and I am hapi)y 
to say in much Ijetter circumstances at that time than they had been 
for weeks before. Our situation in regard to provisions was such as 
I never wish to see again. Short commons ever ought to be 
avoided, and when it cannot, the consequences are to be dreaded in 
an army, that you well know. However, I can with pleasure in- 
form yon (and what I think will give you no small satisfaction) that 
the lads bore it with the greatest patience and fortitude. 



306 

- We- consider the severity of the season, the difficulty of trans- 
poiiatiou, and were willing to make all allowance iwssible. 

My good friend, it requires almost the wisdom of Solomon to 
conduct at these times, and the virtue of the Angel Gabriel to sur- 
mount the difficulties which, to appearance, came upon us as it 
were in a moment. 

After our long march you may well think our men were rather 
destitute of clothing. After our arrival we began and completed 
our huts, which destroyed our clothing still more, and to my certain 
knowledge we had not more than fifty men in the regiment returned 
fit for duty, all for the want of clothing. Many a good lad with 
nothing to cover him from his hips to his toes save his blanket ; 
some wanting one thing and some another, but the most general 
complaint was shoes. Once we did not experience these hardships, 
though we had greater reason to expect them at this time, when the 
public were convinced for three years past they had an army de- 
pending uj)on them for subsistence. 

As to provisions, before I left them they had received a full 
supply for the present, and clothing they received some, though 
inadequate to their wants. In short, my good friend, our suffer- 
ings were such as I did not expect at this day, and such as is past 
any art with pen, ink and paper to describe or even give you an idea 
of our feelings upon the occasion. 

Am informed you set out for headquarters soon.; hope you will 
take Hartford in your way, that I may have the joleasure of seeing 
you and spending a little time in chat upon matters and things. I 
hear an exchange is like to take place, which is my most earnest 
wish should be effected, that I may once more have the happiness 
of seeing you at the head of your regiment, and where you have 
been long exijceted and much wished for. 

The family join with me in their best wishes for your health 
and happiness, and respects to your brothers and sisters. Make my 
compliments to the good jieople at Col. Chester's, and excuse this 
scrawl, as coming from one who remains with esteem. 

Your friend and 
Humble servant, 

Col. S. B. Webb. J. Walker.

QX\ ^..-^ Stratford, Fel/y 27, 1780. 

Dear Sir : — Knowing yonr anxiety for tlio Welfare of your 
Keg't &amp; your great desire for having it recrnited, induces me at this 
time to ofiEcr you my sentiments upon the subject, as I am inform'd 
you expect to go on to Headquarters this week, and my business 
being such as will unhappily })revent nu" Juiving the pleasure of 
seeing you in this place. 

The prospects of Eecruiting in the country as well as with the 
army you must be sensible are very dull at present, though I am 
confident there are a great many recruits may be got among those 
whose time of service has expired this Winter, and others, especially 
these State Eegimcnts that arc now raising to send down to the 
Lines, if proper encouragements are ofEered &amp; pains taken. 

I heard Gen'l Parsons propose a plan, and such as I believe he 
means to adopt in his Brigade on his return to the army. That 
was to send into this State a number of likely Serjents &amp; some 
Musick under the care of some officers, &amp; let them go from Town to 
Town among the State Troops and beat up for Recruits. You 
miTst be sensible that there arc numbers of men now only awaiting 
to know what is done for the army &amp; what bounty is given to en- 
coiTrage them to enlist. 

Our Regt. is on as good footing as any now is, the service from 
this State, &amp; I think might stand a good chance to recruit should 
the officers exert themselves. All this I offer on the strength of 
yo\ir being exchanged, which I suppose is almost a certainty, &amp; be 
assured is the most earnest wish of your sincere friend &amp; 

Humble Serv't,

in the Beg't from the first, though he has not been able to discharge 
the duty of a s/jldier by reason of a pain in hLs hack, which at time-s 
he is subject to. He has a brother who will enlist to take his place. 
The lad is about seventeen years of age &amp; am informed he ia a 
strong, hearty Boy — ^should think might be more beneficial in the

will accept of his Brother or not. I also request you to inform me

Capt. S. Williams" Letter, rhy) . cCffUiCicy 
Connecticut IIutts, 1st Dec, 1781. ' 

Dear Colonel : — Some weeks since I wrote you by Beldcn, 
which letter I expected would have found you at W'f'd, but Lieut. 
Strong informs us that you arrived there but a few days before he 
saw you, from which I fear ytiu must have had a long and tedious 
passage. He likewise brings the melancholy news of the death of 
your Lady, whose amiable character, withoiit the pleasure of a per- 
sonal acquaintance, I find sufficient to interest me in the affliction 
of her friends, whose grief must be exceeding great. But the sor- 
rows of one possessed of the most susceptible feelings, and in that 
near connection which you had but lately formed, must be such as 
will recpiire every virtue to support. For me to suggest the pro- 
priety of an humble submission under the most afflicting events, or 
endeavour to alleviate your jn-esent sorrows, while reminding you 
that those virtues and desirable accomplishments, which so greatly 
endeared your departed friend, are sufficient grounds to believe that 
they have attended her to those happy mansions, where only they 
would receive their reward, — would be improper as unnecessary, since 
the same disposition which inclined you to form the connection 
which is now dissolved will lead you to such reflections as are be- 
coming the occasion of your sorrows. 

But lest I should increase that grief which I would wish to 
soften, I will only add to this melancholy letter, that I most cor- 
dially share with you, in your present affliction and my sincerest 
wishes that your sorrows may receive every consolation which the 
sincerity of your grief can admit — and am with sincere friendship 
&amp; esteem. 

Y"r humble serv't, 

S. Williams. 



31? 

P. S. — Please ti) present my iiKJst friendly coniplinients to 
your good Brother &amp; family. 
Colo. Sam'l Webb. 

The enclosed letter to my afflicted friend I expected to have 
forwarded by Capt. Bulkley, but as he has postponed the journey 
for a few days, shall send it by Beldon, ^vho arrived last ev'g and 
leaves Camp to-morrow. 

The friendly manner in which you mention the reception of 
my former letter confers the obligations upon myself if they afforded 
the least satisfaction in the distressed situation in which they found 
you, it is all I could wish— and in your present affliction to deny 
that consolation which the most sympathetic feelings of a friend 
could afford, would be unfriendly indeed. I am sensible it is only 
those who have experienced the loss that can realize your sorrows. 
We know them to be severely great and share with you in grief. 

As Capt. Bulkley writes j'ou it will be unnecessary for me to 
be particular in Regimental matters — indeed I could only say that 
the men are destitute of clothes, even to a greater degree than they 
were last winter. We expect to draw clothing shortly, but it may 
be several weeks first. I hoj)e Colo. Huntington will come on as 
soon as he can make it convenient, as it is a matter of consequence 
to have a field officer with the Regt. 

We expect the lads from the Southward will soon l)e here. 
The invalids from Col. Scammel's detachment have arrived. 

AVe are just beginning a furlough. The orders arc very strict. 
There is to be a field officer to each Reg't and a commiss'd offi'r to 
each Co. constantly present and two men from a Co. on furlough. 
We have heard nothing from the Serg't who was with you on the 
passage — it would be injurious to those here to be long absent. 

You have probably heard that Capt. Parsons has retired and 
that Rogers succeeds him in the Reg't, so that wo have only three 
Capt's on the Staff. Gen'l Parsons is very sick at Danbury — 
his Excellency is expected here in a short time whicli will ailord 
the pleasure to those who have already been too long under the 
command of some we would wish to be clear of. 

I will close this letter with the request of the gent'm of the 
Reg't, whose best wishes attend you, and who sincerely lament 
your misfortunes, and am with the sincercst esteem. 

Y'r affectionate friend, 

Colo. Webb. S. Williams.

■e^ ^CCty Jon'th Williams' Letter. 

BosTOif, Feb'y 24, 1780. 
^y^BEAU AVebb : — Enclosed is a letter for Gen'l Washington. The 
^-^/^ase of wine which I hope was taken jjarticular care of went ac- 
cording to yoiir direction. I leave it to you to acquaint Gen'l Wash- 
ington the mode of my sending it. I am sure yon will make the 
best of it, and lay me under many obligations which I already anti- 
cijDate. 

This letter has been wrote some time, liut I knew not till to-day 
that it was sent on. 

Apropos, Samjison in the Packet is arrived at the Vineyard. 
He brings this story. That Ireland under pretence of opposing an 
invasion from France and Spain requested a supply of arms, &amp;c., 
which they got to the amoimt of 40,000, &amp; then remonstrated, 
prayed for a redress of Grievances, &amp; asserted their rights to a free 
Commerce, with a hint that if this was not allowed then they would 
redress themselves. That Sir Jos. J^ork had left tlie Hague in a 
Hurry, and that the Parliament were assembled in a Hullul. 

I write this in a hiirry ; however, I will write with more leisure 
another time if you will address me a correspondent. I want to 
commence an intercourse with one that from his situation will be 
able to inform me, and all the news that is interesting to you here 
you shall be supplied with in a homespun dress, if you ajiprovc the 
chdice I have made for a correspondent. 

I am, 

Your most obd't.

Maj. J. P. Wyllys' Letter. 
Highlands, Const. Hutts, 10 December, 1781. 1 

Dear Colo : — The day before yesterday I arrived with the 
troops at this post sufficiently satisfied with our march, but all 
pleased with what was once thought so execrable — a sight of the 
Highlands. 

The news of your misfortune first reached me at Pliiladeli&gt;hia, 
and was confirmed at Mr. Lott"s barely; to say that I condyle with 
you docs not do justice to my feelings or friendship. AVhat a man 



310 

of your sensibility must feel on such an occasion I think l/a_n in 
some degree Judge — indeed my dear Col. I feel with you. 

Capt. Williams doubtless gives you the situation of the Reg't. 
I am sorry it is necessaiT for you to be troubled with such affairs 
now. A field oflScer mtisi be with the Reg't this winter. I shall 
tarry sometime longer than I otlierwise should, had Colo. Hunting- 
ton been present at my arrival, but I shall not remain for more than 
a fortnight. I should imagine he ought not now to be critical as to 
the expiration of his furlough. 

The condition of our whole line is at present very disagi-ceable, 
the soldiers uneasy for want of pay and clothes. I wish our friends 
in Conn't were properly sensible of the consequences which nuiy at- 
tend it. 

Be so good as to present my compl'ts to Mr. &amp; Mr.-. Webl) &amp; to 

your sisters. 

Believe me, s'r. 

Your Friend &amp; Humble Scrv't, 
Colo. S. B. Webb, Jxo. P. Wyllys.

, {^ Dear Colo : — The tea and sugar came safe for which I am 

U^ oljliged to you. We get no news here, except what is contained in 

Jimmie's Letter, which I enclose. I hope to find the troops when 
I return ready to take the field, as the herbage here is very luxuri- 
ant. The Duty here is not much easier than at first, or rather is 
more natural. I have slept under cover no night since I have been 
at the post. We make use of Serg't White's led of honour on which 
ten thousand men might sleep without touching. However, the 
duty may be called hard, our men grow sick fast. 

A party of our voliinteer horse which I had sent as scout fell 
in with some refugees, five or six of whom they wounded and took 
one prisoner. That is all the military exploits in which I have as 
yet had any hand since the command commenced. I expect at 

least Gen'l 's thanks for planning. 

My Compliments to the officers 

of the Keg't and believe me,

Hartford, May 13, 1780. 

D'r Sir :■ — I sn]i])ose you well know that; for some reason or 
other the officers of (mr lleg't had not received their commissions 
when I left the Keg't, and as I have thought of going to Europe in 
the Fall, should be much obliged to you if you would take the 
trouble to get my commission made out, and send it me, tho' I 
supj^ose there has been one made out some time ago, tho' I never 
received it. You know a certain person if he had it, and knew it 
would be any service to me, would not have delivered it to me, ex- 
cejit he was obliged, for which reason I have never applied for it 
before. The reason of my wanting t(j have it is that I imagine it 
might be of service to me abroad by gaining me respect if not 
friends. I should also Ije glad if you C(juld get me an honorable 
discharge from (Jeneral Washington, as I never had one, nor was 
mustered out as a supernumerary, tho' jierhaps tlie JIajor might 
consider it in that light. I never received the year's pay which 
was allowed to supern'y officers nor indeed ever desired it, as I did 
not enter the service for the sake of pay or liank and imagine 
should not have quitted it till the war was over, if yon had not been 
so unfortunate as to be taken from it. 

I beg you to let me know whether you can coni])Iy with my 
request the first opjiortunity, and in the meantime remain

Sam'l 15. Webb's Sentiments on .Matriniony. 



If ever we may be allowed to say, that marriages are nuule in 
Heaven, it must be when tho union is formed upon a disinterested 
affection ; a love that cannot be described even by those who have 
felt it. My own heart tells me that it is beyond all description. 
Sure I am, that the flame is kindled, and cherished by a superior 
power. 'Tis not a pretty face, or an elegant person. 'Tis not a 
brilliant wit, or a fine understanding, that can excite or i)reserve 
mutual affection. It springs from an higher source. It has been

My Dear Webb: — The enclosed I need not give any directions 
respecting its being put in the proper road to meet the owner. You 
will readily imagine it. Tlie want of an opportiTuity has at length 
induced me to impose this task on my friend, conscious from long 
taught experience that he would do it with pleasure. 

I can say little to you from this quarter that would be any ways 
diverting or novel, but that I am drudging on in the old way and I 
may say with propriety, living on anticipation, for were I to suj)- 
pose that the last of Days would bear a comparison with these I 
know not what I would not be tempted to do. 

I need not relate to you the state of my domestic affairs in my 
family in town. You doubtless know all, and I assure you my 
friend that altho' I am Ijanished at present from the sight of those 
in this world most dear to me, yet I am infinitely more happy than 
a month ago saw me. 

My love to Mrs. &amp; Miss Wickham and oblige your troublesome 
yet believe me.

Friday Evening. )' 

My Dear Brother :— I have Just heard that Col. Dclaney 
sets off for New York in the morning. I could not let so good an 
oi^portunity pass without writing a few lines to assure you tliat we 
all are every hour wishing for you again with us. But alas ! Iiow 
unavailing are such wishes. We must make ourselves easy until 
you are exchanged, which I flatter myself will be before agreat while. 
You may perhaps think from what I have said, that we have some 
prospect of a speedy exchange, but that is not the case. I think it 
right to hope the best, not to anticipate evils. I was very anxious 
on your account until Friday. Then your kind letter arrived and 
dispelled all my anxiety on your account. How happy 3'ou are to 



336 

be in so amiable a family as our friend Mr. S . Him I know 

and have the gi'eatest rcsi^ect for. His lady is a fine ^\oman. I am 
not acquainted with her virtues, but I am witli lier person. In 
company with such agi-ceable people you cannot but be content — I 
had almost said happy — but I hardly think it possible for a prisoner 
to be really hapjiy. Do not let your spirits sink ; everything de- 
pends upon keeping them up. 

Your friends at the other house are well, and desire to be re- 
membered. They have been much with us of late. The Major is 

with his friends. It is a week since he left iis. Mr. L 1 and 

Col. L n arc expected this evening ; indeed, we have looked 

for them for this week past. They have paid Boston a much longer 
visit than they talked of when they left us. Should you see my 
friend iliss Howard, give my love to the good girl, and tell her that 
I want much to see her ; that I often think of the many haj)py days 
we have spent together at our good Mrs. Ilowdings. Ask her, too, 
if you please, wliat is become (jf Miss Mobson. She was one of our 
happy family. I have never heard one word from her since we 
parted in Boston. I loved the good little girl, and should be hajipy

My Dear Webb : — Our old friend Scammel paid the last debt 
of nature on the Gtli instant, at tlie hospital in Williamsburg. I 
have informed you of his being made a'prisoner &amp; wounded — which 
wound proved fatal, and he is no more to be found in the walks of 
men.^.^ 

' (4)n the morning that the enemy evacuated their advance re- 
doubts, he being officer of the day, reconnoitci'cd rather too far, fell 
insensibly among a number of horsemen who were patrolling tlie ^ 
front of the lines they had retire'^ to. Two of them addressed him v- 
rather in harsh terms. The one seized his bridle iw yl tlie otlier '^/ 
presented a pistol to his breast. Thus situatccl, lie acknowledgjjd ~ »t. 

himself a prisoner ; when a third rode up presented his pistol close 
enough to burn his coat, &amp; shot him in the liaek_ yS/ fourth made 
a stroke at him with his sword, but the shot liavmg weakened him 
he fell from his horse &amp; the intention of the vilM'n was frustrated. 
They plundercd'liim of everything he had,'tt hurried him into 
their Lines. The officers who were present never interferi*d nor,

Wr Sam'l : — Upon my arrival at Mori'istown I found letters 
from his Excellency and the Marquis,* the contents of which ren- 
dered it necessary that I should set off immediately for Camp, and 
deprived me of the promised pleasure of visiting your family as I 
intended ; but as I am the person disappointed I conclude an apology 
to you is in some measure unnecessan." therefor — 

I am informed that the arrangement of your line is returned to 
have some alterations made. If I could get my name enroll'd I 
should be happy, &amp; as I must consider myself at jiresent a member 
of the State I think my intentions not slightly founded. 

There is a Lt. Col. Johnston in your line who I am informed 
wishes for for an opportunity to retire. I should be happy to give 
him one by taking his place in the line. It can injure none of the 
inferior oflBcers and the superior, I flatter myself would have no 
objection. I am told they have conversed upon this subject &amp; no 
objections were started except by Lt. Col. Gray. His reasons I am 
not acquainted with, therefore cannot give you my sentiments upon 
them, but am a little dubious whether they will stand a strict 
scrutiny if they should refer to its being a precedent that might 
hereafter prove injurious. That may be easily obviated as there is 

*La Fayette.

no Gentleman at prefcnt in tlie army in a similar situation, &amp; as I 
mean to enter ujion no other consideration than by an unanimous 
consent of the field officers, it will be setting an example that will 
in my opinion rather be of service than otherwise. I intended 
to have waited on you this morninir, but am detained in order to 
join the Marquis, &amp;c., &amp;c. 

If j'on will inform me after consnlting- on the sul)jeet how mat-

It was agreeable &amp; Unexpected \ews.

Jerc Wadsworth's Lettei-. 

XoETH Castle, Xot. 15th, 17?8. 

Deak Sir : — I received yours of yesterday. You may depend 
oil my attending to your affairs. I will write you as soon as I am 
informed of their situation. I believe tliey are all safe. I shall be 
much obliged to you to attend to tlie inclosed advertisement, as you 
will see by it I have lost my horse, and it will be a great disappoint- 
ment, and a loss that I am not willing to put up witli, as I have 
lately met with several others. Perhaps the horse may be brought 
to headquarters for sale, as he is so good a one. 

I am very unwell with a pain in my head and heart, spitting of 
blood, etc. I expect to go home in a few days, and if you have any 
commands, propose them. I must return soon as I have put my 
affairs in order there but not to stay. I am determined not to be 
in a situation so very disagreeable as I have been lately. I wish 
you would return my letter from Tracy, and let me know what his 
Excellency's opinion of Geii'l BelVs conduct is. I wish to have it 
remembered that I sent that letter to headquarters, and for the 
reason that much loss has hajipened and great waste has been made 
of the stores since I have been moving them, and in some future 
time when these losses appear, it may be forgot that those people 
whose duty it was to have gTiarded the magazines neglected them, to 
say no worse of it. 

And the blame may be at my door, and it is not impossible 
that I may lose my character if not my estate. If his Excellency 
were to write something on this matter, setting forth the circum- 
Btances attending the moving of the stores, and the difficulties and 
losses necessary attending such a sudden movement, I think it would 
secure me from future blame or loss. I do not want to make any 
more use of it but to secure me if I am called, and never will show 
it unless I am obliged to for my own safety. 

And this I will not expect if the General has the least doubt 
about the propriety of it. And yoa will mention it in your own 
time and way. But the sooner the better for me. At any rate, 
write me and tell me the news, etc. 

Give my compliments to Col. Gary, and tell him the girl has 
got a pain in her heart, and I'm afraid she is pining after him. He 
is a sad dog, a very sad dog, to offer to touch any of the Commis- 
sioner's stores (girls come within the article of stores, especially 



333 

when they are in liis ]i()use.) I liave eourted her for Iiim ever 
since he went away. I don't know but slie will send him word tc^ "" ■ 

come back, but she has not promised me to do so yet. AVhen she ''''•-^- 
does I will send him word. " 

If you don't go from Peekskill soon I shall see you, as I must 
see General Mifflin before I go to Connecticut. 

I am, Dear Sir, 

Your most obcd't serv't

Dear Coloxel : — The &gt;Sergeant, whom you sent into New 
Jersey with your letters returned this day ; he brought only one, 
w^hich will be handed you with this. Mrs. Lott did not write, but 
says you may expect a letter from her very soon. As the Sergeant 
who carried your letters belongs at New Haven, it will be verj- in- 
convenient to send him to \i&gt;f*r Shall therefore send another lad &gt;^iTt ^ 
with this ; as Captain Burkeley is with you it will be needless for me ^ 

to particularize on Regimental matters. Our lads arc so entirely 
destitute of clothing that it is difficult to persuade them to take 
furloughs, which is a sufficient proof that their unifcn-ms are not 
decent. The Light Infantry and a part of Colonel Scammel's com- 
mand arrived here yesterday. Major W'yllys will writeyou. Capt. 
Bith has not arrived, but is expected within a few days. The 
other gentlemen of the regiment from Virginia are with us, but all 
expect to be in Connecticut very soon. If Colonel Huntington could 
make it convenient to come before the clothing is drawn (which it is 
lirobable will be within fifteen days at farthest) I think it would 
be of real advantage to the reginu'nt ; indeed, there is not a month 
in the year in which it is of more consequence to have a field officer 
with the regiment than the present, arnl Major Wyllys will remain 
with us but a very few days. 

We have nothing of consequence to accpiaint you with. We 
expect a new arrangement of the army will shortly take place, and 
it is probable that the number of regiments will be reduced. Gen. 
Lincoln has accepted his appointment of Minister of War, and re- 
mains at Philadelphia with his Excellency. The latter it is jtmba- 



334 

blc will not be with us until late in tbc winter. I think it jiroljable 
that scTcral sergeants in the line will soon be promoted ; wish yon 
to speak to Col. Huntington upon that subject, that if you should 
think it proper to ]iromote any of ours we may not be behind 
Iiand. 

At present the want of officers in the regiment is a real injury 
to those of us who are with the regiment, but I have only room to 
request my mcst friendly com])limentG to your brother and family 
and other friends, and am, 

AVith sentiments of esteem, 

Yours, 

Cil. Webi!. S. Williams.

ily Deak Bkotiier : — Mine, by AV. Frink, I liope you re- 
ceived. Let me repeat to you the sensible obligaticm we are under 
for the civil, genteel Ix'havior shown you liy all ranks — those atten- 
tions you have shown prisoners when in your hands is, I am now 
told, most amply returned ; nothing in life can be more pleasing 
to a feeling, susceptible mind, nor a mark of greater soul tlian treat- 
ing a prisoner well when in your power, as well as the highest 
heights of good, sound ^w/i'c?/. I could wish to have a long, circum- 
stantial letter from you of the return of the Mrs. Smith, who now 
is jiermitted ))y his Excellency, (fovernor Trumbull, to visit her 
aged mother in New York. I have ventured to say, if she gets per- 
mission to go she will be treated with the greatest politeness from 
the officers of the army on both sides. 

I have been expecting some garden seeds from my friend Mr. 
Chew, likewise a list of the jirisoners in the Xavy Uejiartment, send 
me back Rivingtoii and Gains' papers. Tell Col. Hirdyship his lady 
was yesterday with me, and lias lately, with all her children, had the 
small-pox, and is now anxious to go to him, but as yet has not 
liberty. She much wants to hear particulars from her husband with 
his jiarticular orders. AVill you ask Col. Lawrence how he does, 
and whether the act (lie knows what about) is settled. AVhere is 
Sargent Ballantine 'i He uses me excessively ill ; in sliort, tlie 
British prisoners are in distress for clothing. I wisli yi.u W(ra]d 



335 

nu'iiticn it to Col. .Slurril'e .iiid the otlui- officers. Let Cairfain 
Emmerick know that the new levies are in great distress for eloth- 
mg (for Heaven's sake let the general exchange take place for the 
advantage of both sid(.s). There has been such desertions of the 
prisoners that William's tells me he is obliged to shut most of them 
up, which is extremely bad, and I am told of their almost as often 
as every other day breaking prison, etc., etc. Much could Ijc said 
of the bad consequences of keeping prisoners so long confined. 

This letter was to have gone by Mrs. John Smith, but this did 
not happen, and now will be handed you by Mrs. Friuk or Ensign 
Green. Mr. Frink you know ; he wanted to settle with our friend 
Mr. Sherbrook. Ensign Green has been very attentive to the 
British prisoners, and deserves merit for the care of 'em, and can 
tell the necessity of their gi'cat want of clotlies. 

My most respectful compliments to Mr. Sherbrook and his 
lady. General Robertson and his two aids-de-camp. 
I am, Dear Sammy, 

Your most affectiouate brother,

Lieut. Blotchcni, I advanced some money to, has run off. If 
you see Mr. Moor, Paymaster to Governor Brown, I wish yoii or 
Mr. Chew to mention if he has any pay to stop it for his friend 
Webb, if consistent. Ask our friend Chew again and again not 
to forget the scarlet beans, savory, cabbage, cauliflower, and sweet 
marjorem.

E. Haskeirs Letter. I^l/y-}. t^ex\,^Lto\ 



New York, 34 August, 1780. 
My Dear Jack : — The train of circumstances which have led to 
the issue of the dispute between your Brother and Livingston were 
not fiilly foreseen. The most of them you have become acquainted 
with and there are others that can never be represented. I am 
however fully persuaded that there is SufiBcicnt proof against Mr. 
Livingston and in favor of your brother to convince every unprejui- 
diced person of the criminality cf the former and the innocence of 
the latter. 

On these points everything in my opinion depends Whenever 
the Challenge and acceptance come into view there are scarcely two 
of opinion, nothing is more common and easy for a man to put his 
hands in his sides and say, trivial as the dispute may be "tliey 
ought to have fought. 

By heaven, we are a very contemptible set of beings and so on. 
They who reason least are the most clear for a solemn appeal. — that 
is for others not for themselves. 

Your Brother does not appear fully satisfied altho' I think he 
has abundant reason to be so. Those whose opinions are worth 
taking acquit him of every possible imputation. 
I am. 

My Dear Jack, 

Y^ours, sincerely, 
Capt. Webb. E. Haskell. 

P. S. — If Your Brother has any recollection of me, I beg that I 
may be remembered to him in a favorable manner.

Dear Colo. :— I hope to See you in a few Days. Shall there- " ^^^^'^^'^ T'- 
fore say only that I propose to set out for Camp next Tuesday at the ^- &amp;^ , 
farthest, but if you arrive there pay no Regard to this but come on 
as fast as Possible to Philadelphia, for if you meet mc on the Road 
it will be as well, perhaps better. I shall go by Trenton, Princeton 
and so on the Common Road direct to Baskenridge, where if you 
arrive before me, come on to meet me. What ever you may ob- 
tain of Intelligence, I wish to learn of You personally, for the 
practice of intercepting Letters prevails, and these who are Base 
enough to intercept are Wicked Enough to put the worst Constnic- 
tion on Everything. Wishing you success.

Henry Livingston's Letter. 

New York, Mch. 17, 1793. 
Dear General : — Capt. Ten Brocke delivered me your favor 
with the Bundle of orders. With all of which I will do the best I 
can for you. They have not been presented as yet, owing to 
Bancker's being absolutely engaged in the Land office for these last 
two days past. 

There is a Law whicli has had its second reading to direct the 
reasons about Certificates for Military services. I will send you the 
Law by Ten Brocke. I now stand so fair with 'Mr. B. that I believe 
I can do you a friendship if any person can. 
March 18, Sunday evening. 

Your favor of the 15th I received this moment. I shall attend 
to every particular, the matter of D_un is almost come to a 
To-morrow he is to meet his creditors, but be assured his failure will

What a weight of obligation. Ruminating in retirement at a 
istance from all who knfiw or care^a farthing for me : "How poor 
is the friendless master of a world," thoa^t I, when my ser»fit 
entered with your very obliging letter. The usual pleasure of 
breaking the seal was succeeded by a glow of gratitude. Then 
vanity, spite of sober effort, was on the wing, and tickled most 
sWj^tly. 

And is it possible my departure could occasion a moment's re- 
gret «^ to the ladies ? Really, yen have an opinion of my discre-

tioii. Such a coiiiuuiiiicatidU is ennugh to j)uli uuc iutu a CDXcoiiih. 
J^^ But my knowledge of yours aad the goodness very conspicuous in 
the countenanced (if the amialile circle round your lireakfast table, 
which leads me to attribute tlie Ifayoraljle o])inion to your candiir 
rather than to my own nierity Could I be famished with an 
equipoise for the yanity that unayoidably arises upon the occasion^,, — • 
and now to the points Why, then, with the frankness you use, I 
mform the ladies " you did not press me to stay," but on friend- 
ship's hallowed shrine I staj^d not a moment the less with you *^ ^ — ^/ 
on that account ; nor in the least would it liaye retarded my calling 
upon you on niy return had your favor of the 23d never reached me. iiZ^ . 
I could easily forgive an omission when ^n _ ill-tim ed friendship 
called a son of Mars from the armjof Hebe's beauteous sisteE For / 

could I expect even civility^ when my rashness with a man less gen- 
erous would have made a ^crificc to the Cj^n-ian Queen, whose 
mysteries I hadjalthough invertentlv disturbed. Surely I have most 
reason to apologize at least to one of^the ladies, whose pardon I im- 
plore. For you, as you never have, and acting yourself, never can 
offend, I, of course, have nothing to forgive. And if you, as your 
interest is very prevalent with one of the ladies, will get me a 
Ijardon-in the name of friendship, I attribute wliat is passed to for- 
getfulness. Let a general amnesty take place, so we can get all the 
_ ladies to sa;Lamen.^ 

The slave of business, I can neither command my own time or 
movements, and take it not unkindly if I don't promise when per- 
formance may be impracticable^ But your family have so many 
inducements that those who do not call upon them^when opportu- 
nity admits are rather objects of compassion than resentment, for 
neglect of happ/ness which incurs its own punishmcnt;__ — ^ j,.

Jos. Webb's Letter. 

Elizabeth Town, 2U Aug., IMS. 
Dear Brother : — 1 wish this may not find you in York, but 
:(ine home either liy Exchange or parole. I confess I am much 



345 

Chagrined that you have hi'fn detained so hmg, hut Ood only 
knows how nnxch h)nger you nuiy yet he in hondage, for it seems 
that the affairs of Full Colonels yet remains unsettled hetween thi' 
two parties. I did expect the British Officers, many that have ))een 
Prisoners in Xew England, more particularly in Connecticut, would 
have Interested themselves with the General Officers in your hehalf. 
(iratitude is a virtue almost above every other, it must ])lease 
Heaven itself. I have been told that Col. Campbell &amp; some others 
have acted the Gent'm. They have my most unfeigned thanks for 
their politeness &amp; civility, and I hope they may sooner or later be 
sensible that doing a generous good action meets with its reward. 
I feel for your situation and would do every ccmsistcnt thing in my 
power for your release, but really I see no jjrospects as there are no 
full Colonels in the King's Service in America. You will there- 
fore wait with Patience, or perhaps (ieneral Clinton will consent 
to j'our coming out on pai'ole if you can't l)e released. You may 
tell (lencraK Robertson 1 have paid thi' money iicconling to Order 
which I'll soon send the amt. of, that you nuiy receive it. 1 saw (lov'r 
]McKinley who was Endeavoring his Kxchange for (lov'r Franklin, 
but I believe will not succeed. It seems they expect Thompson to 
be exchanged first. But, however, it's not determiiu'd. I could 
wish to complete as much of a settlement with tJiose Bills yon may 
have as you possibly can. I wish you might exchange y'l" Two 
Horses for a fine pair, &amp; if cheap a Genteel Phaeton I much Want. 
I yesterday met with Mrs. ilaterine. Sister of Wm Livingston, out 
from York, who lives at Flushing, on Long Island, &amp; returns in a 
few days who can tell yon more particulars of the situation of Our 
Family. If you .see Col. Barton you may ask him to settle with 
you the money advanced him when at home. He also took in some 
money to deliver Col. Heart, who was a ])risoner on Long Island, 
but while Col. Barton was on his route to Y'ork, Heart was Ex- 
changed &amp; Col. Barton had no opp'y to deliver the money, but now 
has it which you'll please receive and give him a Ileceipt. 1 wish 
you to give my compliments to Mr. .Jno. Winslow &amp; ask him if [ 
shall advanced money to the good Parson's Lady, Miss Lucky,. &amp;c., 
if it's his desire I'll do it with pleasure. I Kec'd two half sovs of 
Doctor Middleton to be Delivered to a Priscmer at Dunstables. 
(Lenten Home Tlst h'eg't) which I forwarded, but verv' lately it was 



346 

returned to me and this montli he was exchanged ; therefore you'll 
repay Doct. Middleton the Two half. 

B. Deane is in company with me on our route from Philadel- 
])hia Home, &amp; desires to be remembered amongst the rest. Our 
Sister Simpson is now at Boston, I hope I will not loose her House, 
tho' I much fear it. 

Since writing the above I have met with the Gent'm bearer of 
this who is polite cnoiigh to say He will this day see you &amp; will de- 
liver it Himself. 

It gives me pain that you can't at least be Allowed to come 
out on parole, your affairs suffer very much &amp; really want your 
personal attention Exceedingly. I can't think but if it was 
justly represented to Gen'l Clinton He would consent to it. Col. 
Campbell, French and many others will aid you and assist you. As 
to your parole they can't doubt, as they have already permitted it 
for Two months &amp; found you strictly adhered to it. Poor Hetty 
not so well as I could wish. 

Adieu, &amp; Believe me 

to be Y'r most aff. B'r,

General Webb to Joseph Barrell. * ' 

New York, Jan'y 13tb, 1875. 

Deae Barrell : — We were made Joyful by last evening's post 
on the news of Connecticut having adopted the Constitution, but a 
damj^ness is thrown on our spirits by information that at the Con- 
vention of Massachusets are much divided. Should that State re* 
ject it we are ruined. On them depends everything. Every Fed- 
eral man in this city looks up to your State for oiir political salva- 
tion, for then if Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Hampshire 
accepts it with tolerable unanimity, this State dare not refuse ; but 
on the contrary, should they reject it, the anti-Federal Junto here 
will increase and come forward. 

The fact is that the sense and property hero all are universally 
in favor, this city is very unanimoiTS ; but we have as you have be- 
fore heard four or five characters violently opposed, none, however, 
whose influence is to be feared 'but Governor Clinton's. His has 
been astonishing in the country, but it is undoubtedly daily lessen- 



The Legislature is now sitting at Poughkeepsie, 80 miles up 
the liver ; what they will do we are at a loss to determine ; that 
they will appoint a convention we haven't a doubt, but suppose the 
anti-federalists will be for delaying its meeting to as distant a period 
as possible. However, as I said before, almost everything depends 
on your State. I wish in your next you would dip a little into this 
subject. Let me know how the convention proceeds, and what the 
prospects are. 

God forbid that Adams should have much influence among 
you. 

We have in the press a pamphlet written by Colonel Hamilton, 
under the signature of Publius on the subject of a Federal Govern- 
ment, which I will send you by the first conveyance. He is un- 
doubtedly one of the most sensible men in America, tho' yet not 
much more than thirty years old. £ I hold him one of my warmest 
friends and he possesses my undivided esteem, j 

We have no late arrivals from Europe, but several ships are 
daily exjiect^d, whon it is probable wo shall know whether peace is 
continued. 

I tliink a war in Europe would be advantageous to our politics 
tlio' our commercial reputations are so bad (or rather the want of 
any general regulations) that I am fearful the mercantile interests

I wrote you by yesterday's post, Tnit bad not then time to be so 
particular as I wished, by Mr. Iti ' illy , who sets ofiE to-morrow. 

I have the pleasure to inform you that on my arrival at head- 
quarters General Washington politely returned me the certificate 
with full power to negotiate the exchange as I thojlt^it proper. 
From this I proceeded to our posts, and l)y a Jlag wrote Jlr. Loring 
(and I euelosed a copy of the certificate) and requested him to meet 
me, acquainting him at the same time that I was fully authorized 
to exchange them. 

After waiting a week I I'eceived for answer tliat it was quite 
needless for him to meet me, as he had lately been with our Com- 
missary of Prisoners and agrecd^i'U Major Oeneral Philli])s and 
EeidH*»i being sent in. Brigadier Generals Tlionison, Waterbur}', 
Colonel Magaw and myself should be at Jiberty, and I have since 
found the two firstynamed are sentj'rom ^^irginia, so that I have 
reason to suppose three or four weeks at Hie l^rtliest will release 
me. However, for fear of accidents I liave k-t»pt the certificate ])y 
me : nor do I intend giving it up jwitil^ny exchange is final. t/ 

I find that a prize or two of tlie (!ates has got into the east-

Indeed, the -nlmh week lias ))een Init one continued "hurrah, from

As to the regimental matters, they are much in s/a/n quo. C'apt. 
Parsons joined us a few days since, and is now in command at 
New Bridge. Lt. Taylor, with a small command of chosen men, 
has now command. Officers has been absent near ten days ; what 
the object of liis expedition is remains a secret ; but as we have 
heard nothing from him yet, except that he was at Stamford, we 
conclude he will effect nothing. 

We most sincerely wish to see you here as soon as the circum- 
stances of your family will admit. Friend Ned, we expect, will 
return within a few days, as he proposed being absent but a short 
time. 

We have reixirts here that the liaritan fleet has returned much 
damaged, and that is all we know about it. However, it is the gen-

Col, DeLancy is returned with nu — so is Col. Ely. Bulkley, &amp; 
Munf ord are on Parole, and are unhapj)y as myself at not seeing you. 
General Robertson, his two aids Wynens &amp; ilurray was vastly ])olite 
to me and deserves my particular thanks. I can hardly jiaint to 
you the attention I received from General Robertson and Governor 
Trumbull, on Putnam's as well as my own account ; those civili- 
ties go beyond what anyone but a feeling good Heart can judge of. 
In short I should not do justice to our most worthy friend Sher- 
brooke if I suffered a line to pass without acknowledging his 
family's friendly notice &amp; regard to me ; added to the rest let me 
recommend to your attention a most valuable couple — Mr. Jno. 
Atkinson and his lady, on whom I have given an order to pay you 
if you want twenty guineas. 

I believe General Rol)ertson will let you come out on Parole 
which I prefer ; but should he not, I think you will be much hap- 
pier in Long Island than York, as Mr. Sherbrooke can tell his 
chit-chat and mince about this and some other affairs. I wish 
you to write me as often as possible. Send nic by Ballentine a 
Hamper of Porter, &amp; 6 Gross Good Corks — tell Col. Meigs I have 
got him a p'r of white epaulets. Ensigii Mumford begs you to re- 
member your officer's commissions which are of consequence io 
them. Should you have any other commands from his Father, he 
wishes it may be sent back by some careful Body to the care of Mr. 
Bears. 

I intended to have wrote you a number of Letters to our par- 
ticular friends, but really tho' I am too fatigued, sleepy &amp; unwell, 
so that you must excuse it — take the will for the deed, &amp; depend I 
shall constantly think of you while you are in your captivity. Gen- 
eral Lee is in some expectation of coming out soon. He's allowed 
the liberty of the town, and when it is proper he'll be very happy 
to see you. We are just at this late hour agreeing to sit down to 
supper, being hungry enough I can give you my word. One and 
all, desire my mentioning compliments, &amp;c., &amp;c. Delancy says he'll 
soon be with you. I have got the bearer to come to you, not know- 
ing, but that yon may want something more than I at present know 
of. Let me know, &amp; if within my grasp you'll have it. I am as 



t3 



366 

anxious for yon as yon can vnsh, tho' I know no one ■srill be treated 
Arith more politeness than yourself, who they think differs so 
widely from them. Let me cantion you to refuse forerer chatting 
on politicks. It can be of no service to yourself or country, ilr. 
Chew and George Brindley, took much pains to please all &amp; will be 
your friend. The latter is quite an agreeable person. I think, 
however, your greatest happiness will be (provided you are obliged 
to stay) in your chamber \\ith your books.

Jos. Webb's Letter. fJu^ , cCo'i-i!^'^^ 
^J^ 14th Jax't, 1??&amp;. ' 

Mt Deae Beothee: — I rec'd yours p'r Mrs. Coffin, &amp; observe 
the contents about the Hay. At that time I expected a Cartel 
would have been settled. After I found the prospect was over, I 
sent to the Governor who sent me permission to forward to you one 
ton of hay, and Barrel of flour, &amp; some little necessaries to make 
yon more comfortable. 

I am afraid ilr. Loring thinks odd of Col. Ely Capt. Buckley 
and Ensign Mnmford for not returning sooner, but you'll please to 
acquaint him that they never heard of it until the 13th instant which 
gives them much uneasiness for fear of censure. They are now pre- 
paring to go. Poor Buckley has met with a sad misfortune — a 
Hhd. of salt fell on one of his feet, which has laid him up for a long 
while, but is so far recovered as to determine to join immediately. 
I believe they'll endeavour to carry in about a b'U of flour a man 
perhaps some cider, wine, spirits, &amp;c. I wish you'd speak to the 
Commissary for his permission. Col. Heart says it will be seized 
as being contraband &amp; against the rules of Flags. I can't think a 
single objection wiU arise on the subject when they know it's going 
to the prisoners' relief without the least fraud. I told them the 
British would notbe guilty of it and they might carry those little ne- 
cessaries without the least damage or danger to either side, for I well 
know I was suffered to bring out Porter, wine, cheese, &amp;c., &amp;c., to 
their ofiBcers while prisoners ; but however, I wish Mr. Loring to send 
a line out to Col. Eno by the first oppr. with his permission for 
those newspapers^ subject to his inspection or any officer that he 
thinks proper after the things arrive at Xew York. 



3G7 

If a good opportunity offers, would it not be well to send your 
carriage and horses out to save the very great expense ? 

Mr. S. D. is yet at Philadelphia in a paper war with Common 
Nonsense. 

Sally and Hetty are at Boston. 

The same Privateer that took the Harriet Packet, we are told, 
has taken the Eagle packet from New York with a number of Bri- 
tish officers ; which officers, except what few were killed, are landed 
in Spain to a British Consul, &amp;his Eeceipt to deliver General Wash 
ington as many American officers of the same Rank, taken. 

Poor Col. Howard of the guards, was killed. The Eagle on her 
passage to Newbury port was retaken. 

Pray how many oiBcers of the rank of Colonel are before you 
in the line of Rotation ? I wish, if consistent, you would give me 
a list of the Connecticut ofScers now prisoners with you, the dates 
&amp; the particulars of the capture. By Ely Buckley and Mumford 
I shall write you. 

Adieu, 

Says, Your affectionate Bror., 

Jos. Webb. 
Wethersfield, Jau'y 14th, 1779. 

I intended to have wrote Mr. Loriug by this app'y, but the 
Post is waiting, &amp; must beg his Excuse, but that he will read this 
Letter &amp; do what he thinks proper.

Sarah Simpson's Letter. i y-jg 

Wethersfield, 28th Feb'y, 1780. 
Friday, 1 o'clock. 

Dear Brother : — By Capt. Delancy you will receive this ; he 
expects to leave town this afternoon or to-morrow early. He will 
be able to give you a particular account of your friends in this part 
of the world. Am happy to hear that you have so agreeable a 
house as our good friend's Mr. Sherbrook's — with them you cannot 
be unhappy. 

We received your letter by Mr. Winslow who arrived here Sun- 
day,and left us the day following for Boston, was very thankful that 



368 

you lent him your horses which forwarded his journey greatly. I 
advise you to be in your usual spirits. Be ever cheerful, which is a 
great promoter of health. I dare say it will not be long before you 
get exchanged and return to your much loved friends who daily wish 
to see you. Jack has been with us ever since you left Wethersfield 
and expects to leave us next week. He was very sorry not to find 
you here. I was in hopes that we might have once more met to- 
gether after an absence of four years. 

Do, my Dear Brother, improve every opi)ortunity they afford 
you of writing me. I shall know they must afford you pleasure 
notwithstanding I have nothing new or entertaining for you, yet 
it's from a friend and Sister who thinks her greatest earthly happi- 
ness is her friends when deprived of them. Adieu to all happi- 
ness. 

Brother Joscy returned safe — no accident attending his jour- 
ney — was disappointed at not seeing you. Believe he will write 
you by this opportunity. 

I remain, 
Your sincere Friend and most affectionate Sister, 

Sarah Simpson. 

Wethersfield, Peb'y 28tli, 1778. 



Sarah Simpson's Letter. ■'7/Tf 

(h/llXt. Wethersfield, April 30th, 1779. 

Dear Brother : — Your letter, my dear brother, came safe,and 
I have just been reading it. Although short it is very affectionate, 
and afforded me much satifaction as I was then very' anxious in 
regard to your health. 

I am very glad that you are upon Long Island. The town is 
too miich crowded, and as the waiTn season approaches it must be 
disagreeble. I have had reason, to dread any more of my friends 
being there, fatal as it was to them. I shall never love the place 
more. 

Should you sec Miss Howard tell her I have not forgotten her, 
but should be glad to see her here again. I have no time to write 
her, indeed, I am not well, therefore you must j)ardon ail amiss in 



30 'J 

this. Iwiis loath sd (rood an ()]iportunity slionld slip without writing: 
this yon'll receive from Doctor Tndor. I shall expect an answer 
when he returns, so don't disappoint mc. 

Sister Webb and Hetty dined out, otherwise would have wrote. 
All your friends wish to sec you and hope that you may return 
soon. Whenever that happy time arrives, must still if possible re- 
quest you to brinj? those things that I some time ago wrote for, as 
I much want them, especially the Caliminco. My friend Mrs. At- 
kinson will give you a small box, if she gets them in season, which 
I must beg your particular care of, as they are of consequence to 
me and no other person. 

AVe had letters from Jack this week, was well and happy. 
Major Huntington is gone and all the rest have followed his ex- 
ample. Our friend Xancy Johnson we expect in a few days, you 
are frequently enquired after, but thought of by none more than 
Your sincere friend and affectionate Sister, 

Sarah Simpsox. 

Should you see Mr. Sherbroke and Lady, remember my com- 
pliments to them, the three little ones are well. Sally improves 
fast.

Sarah Simpson's Letter. 

My Dear Brother : — Long before this, we expected to have 
seen you and are anxious at your delay, what can be the reason ? 
Your friends all wish your return, and that speedily. However, 
keep your usual spirits, all may yet turn as you desire. Indeed, a 
state of confinement must be very disagreeable, and I hope you'll 
soon be out of it. Your kind letter of the 17th of May I received 
and return you my sincere thanks. Continue to write me while 
you stay. They afford me great satisfaction. Am happy I am not 
neglected hy my friend that's absent. 

I should make many apologies for the incorrectness of this let- 
ter, but my eyes arc weak, for its but little more than three weeks 
since I was confined. Indeed I have not left my chamber yet. I 
have a fine daughter and we are both very well. 

I dined with Mrs. Chester three weeks ago. They were all well 
and expressed a great desire to see you. Our friend Nancy left us 
on Friday. Sister Abby returned with her and is to spend some time 



370 

at Stratford: as soon as you get leave to return to Wethersfield, give 
my friends timely notice so that they may write me, 

I heard from Brotlier Jack yesterday. He was in health and 
spirits. Was surprised that he could hear nothing of you. 

Eemember me to Mrs. Sherbroke and my other friends and you 
will oblige. 

Yoiir sincere friend and most 
affectionate sister, 

Sarah Simpsox.

Sarah Simjison's Letter. 

^. aCcUcCti^'y Sunday EvExixG, 

f 10 o'clock. 

With pleasure do I improve every opportunity of writing my 
dear Brother whose welfare is very near to my heart. 

I hope that time will soon expire and that we may soon have a 
happy meeting, and eonyerse freely on what has passsed since our 
separation. Keep in your usual spirits ; remember that we are all 
well and wish to see you. 

I hope that you have received my letters from Colo. Delan- 
cey and delivered the enclosed ones to my friend. 

Brother Jack has been home and left us a few days ago. We 
heard from him this day. He was grown out of my knowledge, I 
think for the better. You mnst give our compliments to Mr. 
Sherbroke and Lady. Miss C. who is here desires to be remember- 
ed to Brother Sammy and wishes most ardently to see you. Mrs. 
Smith whois the bearer of this leaves Town early in the morning. 
She, I dare say, can inform you of particulars, which is more than 
I can write at this time. 

If you have received my letter and noted the contents do as you 
think proper and I will be content. That you may have every bles- 
sing from indulgent heaven is the fervent desire of 

Your friend 

and most affectionate Sister, 

S. SiMPSOX.

Sarah Simpson's Letter. 

Wetheesfield, October 30th, 1778. 
My Dear Bkother: — In tlie greatest hurry imaginable I write. 
I have only time to say that we are all well, except Hetty, who de- 
sires her most afiectionate regards and begs that you would procure 
for her a handsome pair of buckles, and remind Brother to get for 
me the handsomest watch chain that can be got. I am afraid that 
he will forget it. I long to say more, but have not time. I hope to 
see you shortly for many reasons. Brother will inform you what, 
and remember me to all my friends. 
Adieu, 

I am and ever will be, 

Your most afiectionate Sister, 

Saeaii Simpsox.

this first moment after I am assured of your return to Wethers- 
field, to assure you that I am rejoiced you have a fair prospect of an 
exchange, and that I shall be heartily glad when it is effected. 

I shan't write Bro. Joe by this Post as I wrote freely yester- 
day by Mr. Lockwood, tho' I observe what he says in his favor of 
the 9th. Heartily join him in sentiment, &amp; my best wishes that 
the devil may take the man who prevents an honorable peace. Tell 
him we begin to do as he wishes with respect to prisoners as we are 
absolutely determined no one shall go at large in this town. 

I am sorry I can't give you better acc'ts from Penobscot. We 
haven't yet heard of its surrender, tho' I have firm hopes still that 
will be the event, &amp; if I don't wish it, I wish my right hand may 
forget its cunning. I fear I am 3 Hats, a suit of clothes, 3 p'r 
silk hose &amp; 2 p'r of shoes out of pocket on this acc't as I always lay 
on the side I favor, and in these days I very frequently pay for it. 

Don't break your heart, you dog, but as sure as you live, Sam 
White carries off the prize. He will very speedily be permitted to 
build upon the Temple. The old gentleman is as well and better 



372 

than I expected to tind hiui from the accoiiuts I beard of him a few 
days since, but surely his days are nearly numbered and finished. 
We dined there last week. 

I wrote brother Joe yesterday with Respect to a watch and 
chain I supiiose Mr. Brattle has brought out for me from Lon- 
don. I wish when you go again to the lines you will make a point 
of getting them for me &amp; forward them to mo, or if you don't ex- 
pect to go again yourself, I beg ynii will write to a friend you can 
confide in to do the needful. 

If you should go into York again, pray get at Berry and Roger's 
a pair of stone knee buckles like ynur handsomest, or as much 
neater and handsomer as yon please. 

By sereral gentl from France, that liave l^een in London, there 
is but little prospect of those proud fools giring up their idea of an 
Independence. If it will please the asses let 'em style themselves 
Kings of America, as they do of France, and I am content they 
should hold as much power in the- one country as in the other. Sii', 
I trust one day to find their haughty spirits sufficieutl}' humble, 
and when that is the case, I shall be willing to employ their me- 
chanics, for the boys are good workmen, but after wanton brutality 
in America, with all their arrogance, I am sure they '11 never pre- 
tend to anything on the score of humanity, but what a savage 
will be ashamed of. 

Mother grows stout, sleeps as little, lays in bed as long, and 
gets below as early as when you were here, &amp; I despair of mending 
her in this matter. I intend making an advantage of it in Winter, 
as I expect no wood ; she shall lay in bed all day. 

My love to Kitty. I once thought her a girl of her word. She 
promised to write me, and as she knows I am ceremonioits, I can't 
write her first. Mr. D has not forgot her yet. I forljear men- 
tioning names, but you may assure her by the initials, I don't mean 
the devil. 

^Martha &amp; Lilly are very well &amp; send their Loves to you all in 
w'ch joins. y'r assured friend &amp; 

affec. Bro., 

Ool. S. B. Webb. Jo. Bakrell. 

P. S. — Pray don't forget to remember lis to bro. Jack. I 
most heartily wish him a load of laurels, good health and a speedy 
return to his friends.

Joseph Barren's Letter. 

Boston, Sept. 23d, 1782. 
Dear Sam : — The bearer, ]\Ir. Tandy, with his friend Mr. 
Taylor, gentlemen of my acquaintance, are going to Virginia the 
place of their abode. I write only to introduce them to your no- 
tice, and to inform you we are all well. Hetty is getting better fast — 
so well as to go this day to a ball tlie General De Vandevail gives 
at his house. She will not dance, but nevertheless I hope she will 
spend an agreeable evening. We all join in love to you and brother 
Jack. The bearer can inform you I am so busy that I can't en- 
large further than to assure you that I am, as always, 
Your friend &amp; l)ri)ther. 
Col. S. B. AVebu. Joseph Barkell. 




Jos. Barren's Letter. 

Boston, 19th May, 1782. 

Dear Sam. : — I was disappointed in not seeing you before you 
joined the army, as you promised us that ])leasure. 1 now give it 
over until the close of the Campaign, which I trust will be the last, 
but if not, I hope the exertions of this season will drive from our 
doors the common disturbers of our peace, and if they must wrangle 
let it be on British ground. 

I wish the Employment^of the army may drive from your mind 
the painful past of the remembrance of your dear friend. Time 
must befriend us in those calamities, or nothing. A letter lately 
from Wethersfield tells us Mrs. Banker's grief is still fresh. I pity 
her from my heart, but I greatly wonder she grieves so much when 
in all probability it is but a little while she will be separated from 
her darling child. Her loss none but a parent knows, and you 
can be told by none. I have lately buried my youngest child, a 
baby too, as sweet a babe as I ever had and one that promised fair 
to answer my fondest hopes. He was 4 mos. old, and tho' so young 
't was taking a piece of the heart, biit there are things that have to 
be submitted to. 

By a vessel yesterday, in 40 days from Amsterdam, we have as- 
surances that in a few days the Independence of America will bo 
acknowledged by the States of Holland. 



374 

We have various reports of the Engagements in the West Indies 
between the two fleets, but from what I can gather, my opinion is that 
the French have got the best of it. If this be the case I think the 
chance is ten to one that Jamaica falls, as I wish it to most ard- 
ently. 

Friday we had a certain acc't that the Hound, a British 36 gun 
Frigate ran on shore at Cape Bersue, and is lost. I haven't shed a 
tear on this acc't and I don't believe I should if half their fleet was 
as safely moored. 

The Chatham, a new 50 gun ship is cruising in our Bay and no 
doubt will do us much damage. 

The arrival of the Frigate's Alliance and Dean may be looked 
upon as a fortunate event. I think we are acting a very stupid part 
in retaining the lands belonging to the estate. They might be sold 
for large sums now, and if you didn't want the money it might be 
laid oixt in Government securities wh' might be purchased at 1-3 
their value, and ii2ion a peace they would no doubt rise greatly. Yovi 
would I think do well to insist on it. 

Jo. wants a little spurring in this matter. I have turned it to 
him and there are difficulties he says in the way. Well, if there are 
they might be removed for the present opportunity if lost cannot be 
regained. 

8ally is well and joins in love to 3-ou. 
I am. 

Your friend, &amp;c., 
Colo. Webb. Jos. Baeeell. 



Joseph Barren's Letter (Poetry) with a knife &amp; fork. 

BosTOii', April 6th, 1781. 



^U^ 



Dear Sam., to you a knife I send, 
A present from your brother, friend ; 
Xot to cut love, as old wives say 
But to cut victuals, day by day ; 
A Fork is joined in close embrace. 
As you have been, in happier case ; 
Biit press them hard, and they asunder 



375 

Will come that fools may look, &amp; wonder ; 
Divided thus, in each hand one, 
And yon may eat for food, or fun. 
But mind me Same, as heretofore, 
Don't use this knife to cut a score; 
The days that's past, are ov'r and gone ; 
And now you'd better work at home ; 
Enjoy the ilessing ; hug the jJrize ; 
Conccal'd, domestic pleasure lies ; 
Compar'd, the only stveet in life 
Is a fo7id, fair, good naturcd wife 
Attentive virtue in her breast, 
She lulls corroding care to rest. 
Charms gTief to joy, to pleasure, pain ; 
And laughs to hear the word complain — 
Ah, with such tender care carest, 
'Tis Heaven, and you're supremely blest ; 
Long may you thus without a sigh 
Together live, together die. 
Boston, April Gth, 1781.

Boston, June 30th, 1779. 

My Dear Brother :— This afternoon Mr. Wickoff leaves town 
for Philadelphia — by him I send your key. Am very sorry that we 
did not get Josey's letter sooner. I was at Mr. Temple's when the 
post went out. Hetty is still there. Expect her to-morrow with 
the family who are to dine here. 

It gives mc sincere pleasure to hear that you. once more are 
permitted to visit your friends who have long wished to see you, 
but none more than myself, and sliall not forgive you if you don't 
spend most of your time with me before your return. I have mucli 
to say to you. So has Hetty. But you must come here, for I am 
determined she shan't leave me for sometimes ; for with each other 
we are happy, separatedf I am miserable. Remember me to all 
my dear brothers and sisters. I have not time to write them by this 



376 

conTeyance which I am sorry for, Mr. Barrell joins me in love to 
you, and the family. Write me by every opportunity and believe 
that 

I am, and ever will be, 

Your sincere friend 

and most affectionate Sister,

Gexr'l Washingtok. 



(J^Aii^-^ 



To Washington, who greatly brave, 
Rcsolv'd his native land to save. 

Or perish in the cause : 
To Washington, what praise belongs ! 
What marble busts ! what grateful songs ! 

What tributes of applause ! 

At freedom's call, the Hero rose. 

Left each dear scene, and fought our foes, 

And braved their fiercest rage : 
While they (for us a scourge design'd) 
Within their walls inglorious pin'd . 

Nor dar'd with him engage. 

His martial skill our legicms form'd. 
His glorious zeal their bosoms warm'd 

And fann'd the rising flame. 
Like Fabius, he by wise delay, 
Forc'd Britain's bands to waste away. 

Then bade them fly with shame. 



379 

His vengeance struck theui witli dismay, 
His thunders broke tlieir firm away, 

And wither'd all the host. 
Why felt thy chiefs unusual dread ? 
Where were thy sons, ! Britain, iled 

To what ill fated coast ? 

But now the cannon's thundering roar, " 

Begins to echo round the shore, 

And call our youths from far; 
Oh ! now may he, with glory crown'd. 
While guardian Angels shield him round, 

Trium2ihant guide the war. 

At last (for so the fates decreed) 
These climes by him from slav'ry freed, 

And ev'ry wrong rcdrcst. / ^ / S^ r

Kemarks of the Inspector General on Colonel AYebb's Kegiment. 

This regiment is in seven companies, and is too weak to form 
a battalion ; the only fault I4ind with it «^being in the best order 
of any I have yet seen at the first review. The arms are really a 
model for an army. The regiment marches perfectly, and has a 
military air. 

Colonel Webb deserves particular credit for the superior order 
in which he has kept his regiment.

First Order to 3d Conn't Reg't after Release as Prisoner of War. 
Regimektal Orders, 7tli Feb'y, 1781. 
It is with singular satisfaction the Colonel has it in his power 
again to join his Reg't, the Honor and welfare of which has always 
been near his Heart. He takes the^ first opportunity of returning 
his most sincere thanks to the officers for the great care they have 
taken in supporting a Discijiline, which has done Honor to them- 
selves &amp; to the Regiment at large, &amp;^in w-hich he thinks himself an 
equal sharer. The cheerfulness with which the Soldiers have en- 
dured their many unavoidable hardships merits the approbation &amp; 
Thanks of their officers and their Country. 

He most earnestly recommends to officers a steady and constant 
attention to the Discipline of the Regiment.^ ^ the time is fast 
approaching when we shall again take the Field, let us exert our- 
selves that MM- Regiment may appear in superior order^ To accom- 
}*l*eh this, nothing is more absolutely necessary than the strictest 
attention by officers to the internal police of the Reg't — they must be 
answerable that the non-commissioned do their Duty, and that they 
are properly supported in the Execution of it. The Col. flatters 
himself the Soldiers -n-ill continue to behave in a manner be- 
coming the characters of men who are exerting themselves in 
support of everything dear to freemen ; they will continiie to re- 
collect they are not mercenaries fighting for a foreign Prince, or 
for extent of Dominion, but for that which is dearer than life — 
their Liberty. At the end of the War we trust a grateful Country 
will honorably reward their noble exertions, and hereafter they will 
be handed down to future generations as men who have delivered 
themselves and their Posterity from tj; :p t uHiu -jajy«::&amp;£ixm.^»aiul the 
vilest servitude.

/J-ylA''/'^^^ Jan'y 10th, 1782. 

As it is expected that in the course of the present winter, many 
of the officers and men helonging to the Army of the United 
States, will be indulged with leave of absence from their corps for 
a limited time ; and it is absolutely necessary that the strictest 
punctuality should be observed in returning at the expiration of the 
time to which their furloughs are granted ; the commander-in- 
chief has thought proper thus early in the season to signify his first 
determination to all concerned, that every officer or soldier who 
shall absent himself beyond the limitation of his furlough, unless 
he shall be prevented from returning by some inevitable misfortune 
or other casualty which shall be deemed a sufficient reason for his 
detention, shall, for siich conduct, be brought to trial before a court 
martial. Upon the return of any officer, who may have ^^olated 
this order, by absenting himself beyond the time of his furlough, 
report is immediately to be made thereof to the Adj't General or 
deputy Adj't General, who is to represent the same to the General 
or Commanding officer, that the necessary steps may be taken with- 
out delaj-. 

The mode of proceeding against officers as pointed out by a 
resolution of Congi'ess is to be invariably pursued. 

Soldiers are also to be tried and punished in the most summary 
manner, if they will be guilty of crimes so injurious to the public 
service as well as to the interest and feelings of their brother 
soldiers who may, in consequence of the absence of such delinquents, 
be unavoidably debarred the gratification of visiting their friends 
before the oi^ening of the campaign. 

The General, however, cannot but hope by the taking the pre- 
caution of causing this public notice of his intention to be given 
to the army, the disagreeable consequences will be prevented which 
might otherways take place, for he is pursuaded who ever will give 
himself the trouble to reflect, will find that as great indulgences 
as are consistent with the public good and justice to individuals arc 
granted in the first instance ; that as a certain number of officers 
must be constantly kept in Camp — every tres^Dass upon those indul- 
gcncies is an act of injustice to the individual who is detained, 
in consequence of it ; probably in the issue to the piiblic the 



391 

most pointed exactness is iudisiieiisably rc(piisitc in all military 
affairs, events unknown frequently of the greatest magnitude, de- 
pending upon it, and that those men who have attached them- 
selves to the service of their country, should consider that the 
jjublic has a constant claim upon their services, which can only be 
dispensed with under certain circumstances, and for definite 
periods, of which those interested with the regulations of the army, 
■must be supposed to be the competent judges. No officer or soldier 
is to be permitted to be absent on f\irlough, after the 10th day of 
April next, on any occasion whatever.

Adj't General.

To His Excellency ;— Sir Henry Clinton, K. B., Commander- 
in-Chief of His Brittanic Majesty's forces in North America. 

The memorial of sundry officers of the American Army, 
risoners of War on Long Island, on behalf of themselves and 
others. 

Most Respectfully sheweth. 

That a memorial has been drawn up and signed by all the 
officers. Prisoners on Long Island, addressed to the Hon'l the Con. 
tinental Congress, pnrp(jrting an earnest desire that a general 
Exchange might speedily be concluded on, for the mutual ad- 
vantage of the unfortunate captives of both armies. 

For the more speedy effecting so desirable a puqiose, wc, 
your memorialists, most earnestly request that your Excellency 
would be pleased to permit Col. Sam'l B. Webb to accompany Col. 
Baylor to Phila., there to remain on Parole so long as it may be 
necessary to present and enforce the above-mentioned memorial. 

And your memorialists as in Dutv bound, &amp;c. 










The Spirit of the Times. 

We the subscribers, inhabitants of the town of Wethersfield, 
having taken into our serious consideration the precarious state of 
the liberties of Xorth America, and more especially the present dis- 
tressed condition of this insulted province, embarrassed as it is by 
several acts of the British Parliament, tending to the entire subver- 
sion of our natural and charter rights, — among which is the act for 



30:5 

blocking up the harlKiur ( f Bost( n ; ami bting fully sensible of our 
indispensable duty to lay hold on every means in our power to pre- 
serve and recover the much injured constitution of our country ; 
and conscious at the same time of no alternative between the horrors 
of slavery, or the carnage and desolation of civil war, but a suspen- 
sion of all commercial intercourse with the island of Great Britain, — 
Do, in the jiresence of God solemnly and in good faith, covenant 
and engage with each other. 1st, That from henceforth we will 
suspend all commercial intercourse with said island of Great Britain, 
until the said act for blocking up the said harbour, be repealed, and 
a full restoi'ation of our charter rights be obtained. And, 

21y, That there may be the less temptation to others to con- 
tinue in the said now dangerous commerce, we do in like manner 
solemnly covenant, that we will not liuy, purchase or consume, or 
suffer any person, by, for or under us to purchas3 or consume, in 
any manner whatever, any goods, wares or merchandize which shall 
arrive in America from Great Britain aforesaid, from and after the 
last day (jf August next ensuing. And in order as much as in us 
lies, to prevent our being interrupted and defeated in this only 
peaceable measure, entered into for the recovery and preservation of 
our rights, we agree to break off all trade, commerce and dealings 
Avhatever with all persons, who, preferring their own private in- 
terest to the salvation of their perishing country, shall still con- 
tinue to import goods from Great Britain, or shall j)urchase of those 
who do import, and never to renew any commerce or trade with 
them. 

And, Whereas the promoting of industry, economy, arts and 
manufactures among ourselves, is of the last importance to the civil 
and religious welfare of a community ; we engage, 

3dly, That from and after the first day of October next ensuing, 
we will, not by ourselves, or any for, by, or under us, purchase or 
use any goods, wares, manufactures or merchandize, whensoever or 
howsoever imiiortcd from Great Britain, imtil the harbour of Bos- 
ton shall he ojiened, and our charter rights restored. And, 

Lastly, As a refusal to come into any agreement which promises 
the deliverance of our country from the calamities it now feels, and 
which, like a torrent are rushing iipoii it with increasing violence, 
must evidence a disjiosition inimical to, or criminally negligent of 
the common safety, we agree, that when this covenant has been 



39i 

offered to any jierson, and they refiise to sign it, we will consider 
them in the same light as contumacious importers, and withdraw 
all commercial connections with them forever, and jmblish their 
names to the world. 

Witness our hand, Jame, 15th, 177-i.

The Leonard Liftpcnard named in order of July 7th, on page 44, 
was tho'great grandfather of my wife, Helen Lispenard Stewart ; and 
the great great grandfather of my elder children. I add, from ]Mrs. 
Lamb's History of New York, a notice of the family. Lispcnard's 
country seat, laid down on most of the maps of that day, was situated 
on th3 Hudson, near Canal street ; and the " Lispenard Meadow's " 
were famous, in my early days, as the favorite skating ground of 
the youth of the city. The water of the Bay backed up, at high 
tide, to Broadway ; where the " Stone Bridge," as it was called, 
crossed Broadway ; and the water from the Collect passed under it 
to the Hudson, or rather the Harbour. I have seen boats from the 
Harbour lying at that bridge as late as 1819. 



From Biographical and Historical Sketches, Chamber of Com- 
merce Records, by John Austin Stevens. 

" Leonard Lispenard was born in the city of New York, in 
171G. He was the son of Anthony Lispenard, Jr., and grandson 
of Anthony Lispenard, a Huguenot refugee, who came to New 
York about the middle of the seventeenth ccnturj'. He married, 
in 1741, Alice, daughter of Anthony Rutgers. This lady inherited, 
from her father, who died in 174G, one-third of the extensive 
grants which he had received from George II.; and Lispenard 



Vlll 



purchased, September 28, 1748, from the two sisters of his wife, 
(one of whom was Mrs. Eev. Dr. Barclay), the remaining two- 
thirds, thus becoming proprietor of the whole. This was the 
origin of what has since been known as the Lispenard estate. 
Lisjienard was a large merchant ; was Alderman of the city for a 
dozen or more years; was one of the active members of the Stamp 
Act Congress, and was connected with nearly all the later impor- 
tant committees. He was a member of the Assembly from 17G5 
to 1767. He was one of the original members of the Society of 
the New York Hosjntal, and one of its first governors from 1770 
to 1777. He was, also. Treasurer of King's College for a long 
period. His country mansion was on Lispenard Hill, a handsome 
elevation overlooking what was afterwards St. John's Square. 
The centre of this hill was the present junction of Hudson and 
Desbrosses streets. He had three children : 1, Leonard ; 2, An- 
thony ; 3, Cornelia, who married Thomas Marston, of New York. 
Leonard Lispenard, Jr., was born in 1743, and was one of nine 
who graduated from King's College in 1762. He was a merchant 
and member of the Chamber of Commerce. He travelled exten- 
sively in Europe, and was spoken of as a man of fine education 
and intelligence ; and great symmetry of character. He was the 
proprietor of the property known as " Davenijort's Neck," in New 
Rochelle, where he had a summer residence. He never married. 
His brother, Anthony, married his cousin Sarah, daughter of An- 
drew Barclay (merchant), and niece of Rev. Dr. Barclay. He, 
Anthony, was proprietor of extensive breweries and mills on the 
Greenwich road, near the present foot of Canal street. He had 
six children, three sons and three daughters. They were : 1, 
Leonard (3d), who married his cousin (their mothers were both 
daughters of Andrew Barclay), Anna Dorothea, daughter of The- 
ophylact Bachc, and left four children ; 2, Anthony, Jr., died 
unmarried ; 3, Thomas, died unmarried ; 4, Helena Roosevelt, mar- 
ried Paul Bachc, son of Theophylact Bache ; 5, Sarah, married 
Alexander Stewart, of New York, and was the mother of Lispen- 
ard Stewart ; 6, Alice, died unmarried. The down-town streets, 
Leonard and Lispenard streets, were so called by the corporation of 
the city in honor of the family. Bache street, now spelled Beach, 
which was opened through the Lispenard farm, was named for 
Paul Bache. The Lisj)cnards sleep in the family vault in Trinity 



iz 



Churchyard. The honored name is now merged in the families 
of Stewart, Webb, Nicholson, Livingston, Lc Uoj, and Winthrop, 
who are among the dcscondcnts in the" direct line. 



Thus much fur the Lispenards. My present wife, mother of 
my five younger children, is a direct desccudent of that John 
Cram, who, in 1030, in company with others of "the Exeter Com- 
bination," settled New Hampshire ; and the farm he then pur- 
chased from the Indians, remained in the family until since my 
marriage to Laura Cram, in 1849 ; when, upon the death of the last 
of her uncles, it was sold to settle the estate. Her father, Jacob 
Cram, was the class-mate of Daniel Webster, and Lewis Cass, at 
the Exeter Academy ; and was educated for the church ; but pre- 
ferred a business career, and died, in 1809, one of the best known 
and among the wealthiest of our Merchant Princes. Upon the 
death of his cousin, Porter Cram, celebrated as one of the ablest 
leaders of the anti-slavery crusade, the Boston Advertiser said 
of him : 

"Porter Cram was descended from an ancestor, who began the 
planting of New Hampshire with John Wheelwright, the school- 
mate of Cromwell and William Wentworth, the kinsman of Straf- 
ford ; he was born and died within a league of where his first 
ancestor bought his farm from the Indian sagamore of Pisca- 
taqua ; and he spent his life in maintaining the simple framework 
of good goverment which John Cram, of Exeter, joined in build- 
ing, under Wheelwright's direction. The Roman would have been 
proud, who could trace his ancestry to Eomulus, and the legendary 
^neas of Troy, by as clear a connection as the New England farm- 
ers can show between tlieinselves and the founders of a government 
more powerful, and soon to be more universal than that of Eome. 

"The Exeter 'combination' of 1039, as original and cruita- 
ble as the Mayflower cumpact, bound John Cram and the other 
'brethren of the church of Exeter, to erect and set up amongst 
us, such government as shall be to our best disceryiing, agreeable to 
the will of God;' and to submit themselves 'to such godly and 
Christian laws as are estalilishcd in the realm of England, — and to 
all other such laws which snail, upon good grounds, bo made and 
enacted amongst us, according to God.' This agreement was well 



kept by the generations that succeeded, and by none more strictly 
or cheerfnlly, than by Porter Cram, who was always ' ready to assist 
in the administration of justice and prcserration of the peace with 
body and goods and best endeavors, according to God,' as his 
pioneer forefathers made oath." 

"The conspicuous occasion to do yeoman service, in the cause 
of liberty and good government, came to my old friend and polit- 
ical instructor, in 1845, when the slave power made its first great 
stride towards dcsiootism in America, by the annexation of Texas."
