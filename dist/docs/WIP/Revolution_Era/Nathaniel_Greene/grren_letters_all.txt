14*2 LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 

countenance, and the expectation of an immediate 
and triumphant issue, was universal and extravagant. 

But now^ a fatal reverse was experienced. At a 
single blow, the army was annihilated; and the coun- 
try, once more open and defenceless, exposed to the 
incursions of a rapacious foe. 

With this ensued, a corresponding change, in pub- 
lic feeling. Hope and expectation, until this reverse 
inordinately high, were succeeded by a deep and ge- 
neral despondency. In the apprehensions of the peo- 
ple, freedom was lost. The writer of this narrative, 
was situated within the route, by which the army of 
general Gates retreated. Although a child, when the 
catastrophe occurred, he was far from being indiffer- 
ent to the appearance of the shattered troops, and the 
terrified inhabitants. Indeed the impressions he recei- 
ved, were too deep and permanent, for time to efface. 

The dismal fears and forebodings of the country, 
he distinctly remembers: and, now, at the distance 
of nearly forty yfcars, the consternation and dismay 
pictured in every countenance he beheld, present to 
his view a high-drawn image of terror and distraction. 

Nor can he ever forget the (Jeadly effect, produced 
by the cry of " Gates is defeated," which, uttered by 
the hundred tongues of Rumour, and carried, by dis- 
patch messengers, from dwelling to dwelling, was 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 143 

regarded, by every one, as the knell of liberty. Even 
the bravest and most sanguine, had scarcely a hope 
or a prospect left, but that, of once more facing the 
conqueror, and, in a last and desperate effort, esca- 
ping his chains, by an honourable death. Of all the 
stages of the war, in the south, this was the period, 
which most emphatically " tried men^s souls." 

That, under the pressure of such a disheartening 
conjuncture, he had the firmness not to despair of 
his country, redounds, somewhat to the honour of 
general Gates. 

Having retreated to Salisbury, and thence to Hills- 
borough, he, there, succeeded, in collecting around 
him, the fragments of his army. Being, soon after- 
wards, reinforced, by several small bodies of regulars 
and militia, he again advanced towards the south, 
and took post in Charlotte. 

During this movement, the circumspection, and mi- 
litary skill, he exhibited, were not a little superior, 
to those which had marked his former conduct. Se- 
verely exercised in the school of misfortune, he ap- 
peared to have profited, considerably, by the disci- 
pline. But, whatever might be the apparent amend- 
ment of his policy, having forfeited and lost, the con- 
fidence of the country, it was impossible for him, to 
turn the current of adversity. Nothing, indeed, could 
effect that, but the presence of an officer, fertile in 
resources, of a commanding genius, and a spotless 
reputation. 

Convinced of this important truth, and dissatisfied 
with the loss of the southern army, congress resol- 
ved, that the conduct of general Gates be submitted 
to the examination of a court of inquiry, and the com- 
mander in chief, directed, to appoint an officer to 
succeed him. 

In complying with that portion of the resolution, 
which related to a commander of the southern army, 
general Washington, without hesitation, offered the 
appointment to general Greene. In a letter to con- 
gress, recommending the general to the support of 
that body, he made the most honourable mention of 

N 

him, as " an officer, in whose abilities, fortitude, and 
integrity, from a long and intimate experience of 
them, he had the most entire confidence." . 

In this appointment, Washington had the good 
fortune to meet, not only his own views, and gratify 
his own wishes, but those, also, of the South Caro- 
lina delegation in Congress. Writing to Mr. Mat- 
thews, a member from Charleston, he says., " You 
have your wish, in the officer appointed, to the south- 
ern command. I think, I am giving you a general; 
but, what can a general do, without men, without 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 145 

arms, without clothing, without stores, without pro- 
visions." 

The delicacy of general Greene, on this occasion, 
was highly honourable to him. It showed him to be 
a man of correct feelings, an amiable temper, and a 
magnanimous disposition. Far from exulting in his 
appointment, or manifesting any offensive superiority 
over the officer, he was destined to supersede, he re- 
monstrated against the recal of general Gates, pro- 
nouncing him an able commander, notwithstanding 
his misfortunes, and declaring himself willing to re- 
pair to the southern army, and " serve under him." 
Equally delicate, and gentlemanly, in their de- 
portment, towards each other, were those two offi- 
cers, when they met in Charlotte, North Carolina, 
where the command of the army devolved on Greene. 
The conduct and feelings of general Gates, in re- 
signing the command, are manifested, much to his 
credit, in the following order. 

"Head-quarters, Charlotte, 3d December, 1780, 
Parole, Springfield — countersign, Greene. 

The honourable major general Greene, who arri- 
ved yesterday afternoon, in Charlotte, being appoint- 
ed, by his excellency general Washington, with the 
approbation of the honourable congress, to the com- 
mand of the southern army, all orders will, for the 
future, issue from him, and all reports, are to be 
made to him. 

" General Gates, returns his sincere and grateful 
thanks, to the southern army, for their perseverance, 
fortitude, and patient endurance, of all the hardships 
and sufferings, they have undergone, while under his 
command. He anxiously hopes, their misfortunes will 
cease therewith; and that victory, and the glorious 
advantages attending it, may be the future portion of 
the southern army." 

On the next day, his successor introduced into his 
general orders, the following very handsome and dig- 
nified reply. 

" General Greene returns his thanks^to the hon- 
ourable major general Gates, for the polite manner, 
in which he has introduced him to his command, in 
his orders, of yesterday, and for his good wishes, for 
the success of the southern army." 

In addition to this, general Greene had already 
been, and continued to be, the firm advocate of the 
reputation of general Gates, particularly if he heard 
it assailed with asperity. It was believed, however, 
that his magnanimity, and extreme tenderness for 
the feelings of an officer, fallen from his former fame, 
and his determination to frown on unmanly censure, 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 147 

induced him to carry his defence of general Gates, 
as far, at least, as his judgment warranted. It is 
scarcely possible, that, with his luminous views, and 
great military mind, he could do other, than secretly 
condemn, some part of the conduct, of his unfortu- 
nate predecessor. That, in reality, he did condemn 
it, is manifest from the fact, that, under circumstan- 
( ces, not dissimilar, he governed his own conduct, by 
different principles. But, led by the amiability of his 
temper, to be silent, where many considerations for- 
bade him to commend, unavailing censure was ne- 
ver heard to issue from his lips. 

That portion of territory, technically denominated, 
the southern department of the Union, extended, 
originally, no further north, than to the south bank of 
the Potowmac. It included, therefore, only Virginia, 
the two Carolinas, and Georgia. But, to this depart- 
ment were added, soon after the defeat of general 
Gates, for the purpose of strengthening it, Maryland 
and Delaware. 

When proceeding on his route, to the army of the 
south, general Greene visited the governors of the se- 
veral states., composing his department, to advise and 
concert with them, the best plan of furnishing provi- 
sions, and their quotas of troops; and to ascertain, 
generally^ what effective force he might reasonably 
calculate on bringing into the field. 

Having completed, as far as possible, these pre- 
liminary arrangements, he hastened, with his suite, 
to his place of destination. 

The character of parts of the country, through 
which he had to pass, were, by no means, favour- 
able to his interest, or flattering to his views of fu- 
ture success. The inhabitants were deeply disaffect- 
ed to the cause of freedom; and such was their au- 
dacity, springing out of the late triumph, of the roy- 
al arms, that, few as his attendants were, his per- 
sonal safety was, several times, considered in dan- 
ger. His prudence and firmness, however, affording 
him protection, he arrived, on the second of Decem- 
ber 1 780, without insult, or molestation, at the head- 
' quarters of general Gates. 

That officer having, as already stated, surrender- 
ed to him his command, in complimentary terms, re- 
mained with him a few days, frankly communicating 
all the useful information he possessed, touching the 
condition of the army, the country, and the enemy; 
and then, taking an affectionate leave of him, set out 
for the north, never again to appear in the field. 

His long and dreary journey, was a true picture 
of lost favour, and fallen greatness. Although digni- 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 149 

fied in his deportment, and condescending in his 
manners, no eye beamed on him, with a cordial wel- 
come, no tongue saluted him, in accents of kindness. 
He was every where met, with frowns or indiffer- 
ence, neglectful silence, or murmured censure. All 
recollected, in him, the fugitive from Camden, no one 
recognized, the victor of Saratoga. 

Hapless veteran! once deservedly a favourite of 
his country, and, from past services, worthy, still, of 
abetter fate! Although judgment disapproved, and 
prudence justly censured, parts of his conduct; vir- 
tue admired his late magnanimity, and humanity 
wept over his fajded laurels. 



CHAPTER VI. 

The difficulties Greene had to encounter, in first entering on the com- 
mand of the southern army — weak state of the army — provisions and 
military stores wanting — the system pursued, by him, the only one cal- 
culated to save from ruin — The plans of military operation, in 
America, more extensive, than in Europe, and, therefore, require 
more genius for execution — reasons for this opinion — campaigns of 
Greene, compared with those of Napoleon and Wellington — Ame- 
rica not degraded by works of inferiority — the reverse, nearer the 
truth — instances in proof of this — Frederick and Napoleon, per- 
haps, excepted, Greene, an abler commander, than any Europe has 
produced for centuries — Greene, by his wisdom and industry, greatly 
meliorates the condition of his army — the composition of his army 
— sketches of the characters of his principal officers — of general 
Morgan — of colonel Washington— of colonel Howard — of colonel 
Williams — of colonel Lee. 



In entering on the duties of his command, general 
Greene found himself in a situation, that was fear- 
fully embarrassing. 

Although by deep reflection, on the enterprise be- 
fore him, he had informed himself sufficiently of its 
magnitude and importance, the real difficulties of its 
achievement, had been hitherto concealed from him, 
because, he was now, for the first time, apprized of 
the total incompetency of his means. 

His army, consisting mostly of militia, amounted 
to less than two thousand men. Notwithstanding the 
exertions of his predecessor, to establish magazines 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 151 

and military stores, he found, on hand, but three 
days' provision, and a very defective supply of ammu- 
nition. 

In front, was an enemy, proud in victory, and too 
strong to be encountered; around,, and in his rear, 
was a country exhausted, dispirited, and, in many 
parts, disaffected; and Virginia, at the distance of 
two hundred miles, and struggling, herself, against a 
formidable invasion, was the only source, to which 
he could reasonably look for succour. 

With such means, and under such circumstances, 
to recover two states, already conquered, and pro- 
tect a third, very seriously menaced, constituted a, 
task that was almost hopeless. 

The kind of warfare, that alone was suited to 
these purposes, was of the most perplexing and ar- 
duous character; and, to conduct it, successfully, cal- 
led for consummate, and diversified abilities. 

It was not, merely, to meet an enemy in the field, 
to command skilfully, and fight bravely, either in 
proffered, or accepted battle. These operations, are 
among the simplest that present themselves to the 
leader of an army. They depend on mere professional 
qualifications, that can be readily acquired, by mod- 
erate capacities. ' 
But, to raise, and provide for, an army, in a dis- 
pirited and devastated country, creating resources 
where they do not exist, to operate, with an incom- 
petent force, on an extended and broken line of 
frontier, to hold in check, in many points, and avoid 
coming into contact with him, in any, an enemy su- 
perior in numbers and discipline, to institute a vast 
system of military policy, so comprehensive, provi- 
dent, and efficient, as to protect and encourage the 
friendly, overawe the disaffected, and confirm the 
wavering, when these different descriptions of cha- 
racters, reside in settlements and districts, remote 
from each other — To conduct a scheme of warfare 
like this — and such, precisely, was that which tested 
the abilities of general Greene — requires a genius of 
the highest order, combined with indefatigable in- 
dustry, and skill. 

With foreigners, the belief is, perhaps, universal, 
that the operations of our revolutionary war, com- 
pared to the military bperations of Europe, were on 
a diminutive scale; and, that the conducting of them, 
therefore, was no evidence of superior intellect, or 
masterly talent. 

An opinion more palpably erroneous, than this, can 
scarcely be iiriagined. Reverse it, and you approach 
much nearer to the truth. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 153 

As a general rule, the commanders of Europe, 
operate on a limited theatre, with a large force. Un- 
der such circumstances, it is scarcely possible, that 
any great extent of military policy can be displayed. 
The armies must either remain in their positions, or 
meet and fight. They have too little room for manoeu- 
vre or stratagem. To march and countermarch, ad- 
vance, retreat, waste time, detach parties to attract 
and distract attention, effect diversions, and pursue 
every varying measure to overreach and gain advan- 
tage, is, there, a practice comparatively rare. But, with 
general Greene, it was, for a time, the common and 
necessary employment of his life: Such was the con- 
dition of his army, that to risk battle, was to court 
ruin. To attain the great object, in view, therefore, 
with the very limited means, which were placed at 
his disposal, required that his mind should be con- 
stantly, and vigorously on the alert, and that he should 
avail himself, through the medium of stratagem and 
policy, of every advantage, that genius could suggest. 

Necessity compelled him to cover a large country, 
with a small force; which required a great military 
plan. This was, in fact, to operate on an extensive 
scale, and called, of course, for extensive talents. But, 
to cover a small country, with a large force, requires 

but little of either policy or plan. Directed with com- 

u 
mon circumspection, the means are, of themselves, 
perfectly adequate to the contemplated end. In a 
comparative point of view, then, the scale of opera- 
tion is small; and needs, for its superintendence, but 
moderate abilities. 

The writer of these Memoirs, pretends to no mi- 
litary experience, nor has he any attainments in the 
science of war. The positions he has, here, ventured 
to advance, he regards as the result of common sense; 
and, without any serious apprehension of being found 
in the wrong, appeals, for their correctness, to the 
judgment of thpse, who are bred to arms, and versed 
in the practical operations of the field. Strange, and 
extravagant, as, to most readers, perhaps, the opi- 
nion may appear, he has no hesitation in believing, 
that general Greene's campaigns, in the southern 
department, required more of military talent to con- 
duct them, than did those of the emperor Napoleon, 
in which he humbled Italy, Prussia, and Austria. 
The latter, whose means were in his sword, over- 
whelmed, by the direct operation of superior force; 
but the former, destitute of force, employed, chiefly, 
the weapon of policy, dextrously wielded by the hand 
of Genius. The conquests of the one, .were more the 
result of physical power, heightened and embolden- 
ed, by a confidence of victory; while Jhe success of 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 155 

i 

the other, arpse from the unbounded resources of his 
intellect. 

We would not be understood, as meaning to run 
a parallel between general Greene and the emperor 
Napoleon; much less, to disparage the talents of the 
latter, whom we consider, in the mairi, as the most 
distinguished captain of the present age — perhaps, of 
any age. But, many military characters, of sound 
judgment, and no inconsiderable experience, in war, 
who have studied both, with deliberate attention, 
concur in giving a preference, on the score of poli- 
cy, to the campaigns of general Greene, over those 
of the leader, who, in the battle of Waterloo, had the 
good fortune, to conquer Napoleon. This decision 
we believe to be correct. Greene, as will presently ap- 
pear, vanquished lord Oornwallis 5 who, in his genius 
, for war, was superior to lord Wellington, 

It may be laid down, then, we think, as a settled 
axiom, that, as far as policy, and the degree of intel- 
lect their achievement requires, are concerned, the 
real magnitude of military operations, is to be deter- 
mined, much more, by the extent of the theatre act- 
ed on, than by the number of troops, engaged in ac- 
tion. And, further, that the commander, who, in 
America, has rendered himself illustrious, by cover- 
ing and protecting a large country, with a small force. 



156 LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 

could, in Europe, with much more facility, have ac- 
quired renown, by operating, in a small country, 
with a large force. 

We do hope and believe, that the time is near at 
i 
hand, when all that is American, whether it relate to 

peace or war, will cease to be underrated, in the 
countries of Europe. Nothing but ignorance, vulgar 
prejudice, or contemptible knavery, can be guilty of 
such injustice. Nature has not marked the Ameri- 
cans with an inferiority of mind. That the reverse is 
true, abundant evidence might be easily adduced. 
Every person, of observation, well knows, that, in a 
vast majority of cases, the sons of Europeans, emi- 
grating to this country, surpass their fathers, in the 
better qualities of man, both corporeal and mental. 
Whatever is deemed intellectually great, in America, 
would, to say the least, be accounted equally so, were 
it achieved in Europe. If the American be not equal 
to the European officers, whence is it, that they van- 
quish them, with inferior means? 

The truth is, that, Frederick and Napoleon, per- 
haps,' excepted — and we are not, confident that even 
they ought to be excepted — we believe general 
Greene, to have been superior, in all the higher qua- 
lities of command, to any general officer, that has ap- 
peared in Europe for many centuries. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 157 

Preparatory to the commencement of his cam- 
paign, Greene's first care was, to provide for his 
troops subsistence and ammunition. In effecting this 
primary and most essential pre-requisite of war, he 
derived great aid from his personal experience, in the 
business of the commissary and quarter-master de- 
partments. Such, indeed, were the difficulties of his 
situation, that, without this, it is firmly believed, he 
could not have kept his forces in the field. By means 
of the knowledge thus acquired, he was enabled, not 
only to make judicious appointments, in organizing 
the staff of his army, and to perceive, when his offi- 
cers, in these departments, performed their duty; he 
was qualified to dictate to them the measures to be 
pursued. 

This qualification for such a diversity of duties, 
presented him to his troops, in the twofold relation of 
their supporter, and commander; and strengthened, 
not a little, their love of his virtues, their admiration 
of his talents, and their spirit of prompt obedience to 
his orders. 

The advantages he derived from this condition of 
things, were numerous and invaluable: for, much of 
the moral strength of an army consists, in a confi- 
dence in its leader, an attachment to his person, and 
a spirit of subordination, founded on principle; the 



158 LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 

latter of which qualities, may be considered as grow- 
ing out of the two former. 

The wisdom and sagacity with which he had or- 
ganized his army, his salutary regulations, on the 
; score of discipline, and the excellence of his whole ar- 
rangement for action, soon began to be apparent; for 
much to the joy and comfort of his troops, they found 
their condition, in a short time, exceedingly improved. 

To such an extent was this true, that even the 
common soldiery, sensible of the superintendence of 
a superior intellect, predicted, confidently, a change 
of fortune. Their defeat at Camden was soon forgot- 
ten, by them, in their anticipation of future victory. 

They fancied themselves ready, once more to take 
the field, and felt a solicitude to meet the enemy, that 
they might regain their lost reputation, and signal- 
ize their prowess, in presence of their new and be- 
loved commander. 

However limited, in numbers, such an army be, 
when thus morally strengthened, it is always formi- 
dable. 

But there were yet other causes, which added 
much to the energies, and efficiency, of the army of 
the south. It was the chivalrous spirit, and lofty qua- 
lities, of many of its officers. Search the world, and 
no where will there be found, in an equal number of 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 159 

\ I 

commanders, embarked in the same enterprise, a 
higher amount of gallantry, intelligence, and military 
devotion. Many of them were.? truly, the " choice and 
master spirits of the time, who might have stood by 
Caesar, and given direction." 

Most of this band of heroes, had already seen ser- 
vice, in the campaigns of the North, where Wash- 
ington commanded. By his order, and under his eye, 
several of them, had, honourably, signalized them- 
selves in battle. 

With a few exceptions, they were all young; and, 
although respectably descended, and liberally educa- 
ted, yet, far from being wealthy, depended on their 
swords, far fortune and fame. Born within the limits 
of the southern department, to that section of the 
Union, they were most strongly bound, by friendship, 
kindred, and all the ties, that cling so forcibly to the 
heart of youth. Superadded, therefore, to a sentiment 
of patriotism, which led them to hazard life, in their 
country's defence, they experienced a wish, and che- 
rished a resolution, peculiarly strong, to liberate from 
invasion, and insult, that section, which was more 
specifically their native soil. They recollected the ex- 
ploits of the hardy and resolute sons of the north, at 
Bennington, Saratoga, and Bunker's hill; and, actua- 
ted by a motive of high-minded emulation, determin- 
ed to render the fields, in their own department, 
equally illustrious, by the deeds of the South. In this 
resolution they were the more confirmed, by an earnest 
desire to retrieve, by subsequent good conduct, the 
loss of reputation, which the southern arms had sus- 
tained, at Charleston, Stono, Savannah, and Camden. 

Composed, in its higher departments, of these ele- 
ments, supported by a hardy and intrepid soldiery, 
the army of Greene might be beaten or annihilated, 
but could not be conquered. 

Eldest among his officers, and, at this period, fore- 
most in renown, was general Morgan. 

As much, as is the case, with any mortal, that ve- 
teran's reputation and fortune, were the work of his 
sword. 

His mind, of perfect Roman texture, its firmness 
and' valour, which, originally, nothing could shake, 
had been still further strengthened, by much severe 
and dangerous service. Nor were his corporeal qua- 
lities less adapted to the toils of war, and the exer- 
tions of battle. His frame being large, and his person 
, muscular, early labour and extensive practice, in 
athletic, more especially pugilistic exercises, had 
rendered him exceedingly strong, and capable of 
enduring great fatigue; and had further taught him 



LIFE, OF GENERAL GREENE. 161 

the art of using his strength, when engaged in com- 
bat, with the deadliest effect. 

He was born in New Jersey, where, from his po- 
verty, and low condition, he had been a day-labour- 
er. To early education and breeding, therefore, he 
owed nothing. But, for this deficiency, his native sa- 
gacity, and sound judgment, and his intercourse, with 
the best society, made much amends, in after life. 

Enterprizing in his disposition, even now, he re- 
moved to Virginia, in 1755, with a hope and expect- 
ation, of improving his fortune. Here, he continued, 
at first, his original business of day-labour; but ex- 
changed it, afterwards, for the employment of a wa- 
goner. 

His military novitiate, he served in the campaign, 
under the unfortunate Braddock. The rank he bore, 
is not precisely known. It must, however, have been 
humble; for, in consequence of imputed contumely 
towards a British officer, he was brought to the hal- 
bert, and received the inhuman punishment, of five 
hundred lashes: or, according to his own statement, 
of four hundred and ninety-nine; for he always as- 
serted, that the drummer charged with the execution 
of the sentence, miscounted, and jocularly added, 
iC that George the third, was still indebted to him, one 

lash." To the honour of Morgan, he never practical- 

x 
ly remembered this savage treatment, during the re- 
volutionary war. Towards the British officers, whom 
the fortune of battle placed within his power, his con- 
duct was humane, mild, and gentlemanly. 

After his return from this campaign, so inordi- 
nately was he addicted to quarrels, and boxing 
matches, that the villiage of Berrystown, in the coun- 
ty of Frederick, which constituted the chief theatre of 
his pugilistic exploits, received, from this circum- 
stance, the name of Battletown. 

In these combats, although frequently overmatch- 
ed, in personal strength, he manifested the same un- 
yielding spirit, which characterised him, afterwards, 
in his military career. When worsted, by his anta- 
gonist, he would pause, for a time, to recruit his 
strength; and, then, return to the contest, again and 
again, until he rarely failed to prove victorious. 

Equally marked was his invincibility of spirit, in 
maturer age, when, raised, by fortune, and his own 
merit, to a higher and more honourable field of action. 
Defeat, in battle, he rarely experienced; but, when he 
did, his retreat was sullen, stern, and dangerous. 

The commencement of the American revolution, 
found Mr. Morgan married, and cultivating a farm, 
which, by industry, and economy, he had been en- 
abled to purchase, in the county of Frederick. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 163 

Placed at the head of a rifle company, raised in his 
neighbourhood, in 1775, he marched, immediately, 
to the American head-quarters in Cambridge, near 
Boston. 

By order of the commander in chief, he, soon af- 
terwards, joined in the expedition against Quebeck; 
and was made prisoner, in the attempt on that for- 
tress, where Arnold was wounded, and Montgomery 
fell. 

During the assault, his daring valour, and perse- 
vering gallantry, attracted the notice, and admiration 
of the enemy. 

The assailing column, to which he belonged, was 
led by major Arnold. 

When that officer was wounded, and carried from 
the ground, Morgan threw himself into the lead; and, 
rushing forward, passed the first and second barriers. 
For a moment, victory appeared certain. But the 
fall of Montgomery, closing the prospect, the assail- 
ants were repulsed, and the enterprise abandoned. 

During his captivity, captain Morgan was treated 
with great kindness, and not a little distinction. He 
was repeatedly visited, in confinement, by a British 
officer, of rank, who, at length, made an attempt on 
his patriotism and virtue, by offering him the com- 
mission and emoluments of colonel in the British 
army, on condition that he would desert the Ameri- 
can, and join the royal standard. 

Morgan rejected the proposal, with scorn; and re- 
quested the courtly and corrupt negociator, " never 
again to insult him, in his misfortunes, by an offer, 
which plainly implied, that he thought him a villain." 
The officer withdrew, and did not again recur to the 

* 

subject. 

On being exchanged, Morgan immediately rejoin- 
ed the American army; and received, by the recom- 
mendation of general Washington, the command of 
a regiment. 

In the year 1777, he was placed at the head of a 
select rifle corps, with which, in various instances, 
he acted on the enemy, with terrible effect. His 
troops were considered the most dangerous, in the 
American service. To confront them, in the field, 
was almost certain death to the British officers. 

On the occasion of the capture of Burgoyne, the 
exertions and services of colonel Morgan, and his 
riflemen, were beyond all praise. Much of the glory 
of the achievement, belonged to them. Yet, so gross 
was the injustice of general Gates, that he did not 
even mention them, in his official despatches. 

His reason for this, was secret, and dishonourable. 
Shortly after the surrender of Burgoyne, general 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE, 165 

Gates took occasion to hold with Morgan, a private 
conversation. In the course of this, he told him, 
confidentially, that the main army was exceedingly 
dissatisfied, with the conduct of general Washing- 
ton; that the reputation of the commader in chief, 
was rapidly declining; and, that several officers, of 
great worth, threatened to resign, unless a change 
were produced, in that department. 

Colonel Morgan, fathoming, in an instant, the 
views of his commanding officer, sternly, and with 
honest indignation, replied, " Sir, I have one favour 
to ask. Never, again, mention to me this hateful 
subject: under no other man, but general Washing- 
ton, as commander in chief, will I ever serve." 

From that moment, ceased the intimacy, that had 
previously subsisted, between him and general Gates. 

A few days afterwards, the general gave a dinner, 
to the principal officers of the British, and some of 
those, of the American, army. Morgan was not invited. 

In the course of the evening, that officer found it 
necessary to call on general Gates, on official busi- 
ness. Being introduced into the dining-room, he 
spoke to the general, received his orders, and imme- 
diately withdrew, his name unannounced. 
f Perceiving, from his dress, that he was of high 
rank, the British officers inquired his name. Being 
told, that it was colonel Morgan, commanding the 
rifle corps, they rose from table, followed him, into 
the yard, and introduced themselves to him, with 
many complimentary, and flattering expressions, de- 
claring, that, on the day of action, they had very se- 
verely felt him, in the field. 

In 1 780, having obtained leave of absence, from 
the army, on account of the shattered condition of 
his health, he retired to his estate, in the county of 
Frederick; and remained there, until the appoint- 
ment of general Gates, to the command of the south- 
ern army. 

Being waited on, by the latter, and requested to 
accompany him, he reminded him, in expressions, 
marked by resentment, of the unworthy treatment 
he had formerly experienced from him, in return for 
the important services, which he did not hesitate to 
assert, he had rendered him, in his operations against 
the army of general Burgoyne. 

Having received no acknowledgment, nor even 
civility, for aiding to decorate him, with laurels, in 
the north, he frankly declared, that there were no 
considerations, except of a public nature, that could 
induce him to cooperate, in his campaigns, to the 
south. " Motives of public good might influence him; 
because his country had a claim on him, in any 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 167 

quarter, where he could promote her interest; but 
personal attachment must not be expected to exist, 
where he had experienced nothing but neglect and 
injustice." 

The two officers parted, mutually dissatisfied; the 
one, on account of past treatment, the other, of the 
recent interview. 

In the course of a few weeks, afterwards, congress 
having promoted colonel Morgan to the rank of bri- 
gadier-general, by brevet, with a view to avail then> 
selves of his services, in the south, he proceeded, 
without delay, to join the army of general Gates. 
But he was prevented from serving, any length of 
time, under that officer, by his defeat, near Camden, 
before his arrival; and his being, soon afterwards, 
superseded in command, by general Greene. 

Such were the qualifications, and such had been 
the services, of general Morgan, when Greene took 
command of the southern army. His conduct, in the 
battle of the Cowpens, will be stated hereafter. 

There existed, in his character, a singula^ contra- 
diction, which is worthy of notice. 

Although, in battle, no man was ever more prodi- 
gal of the exposure of his person to danger, or ma- 
nifested a more deliberate disregard of death, yet, so 
strong was his love of life, at other times, that he 
has been frequently heard to declare, c; he would 
agree to pass half his time, as a galley slave, rather 
than quit this world for another." 

The following outline of his person and character, 
is from the pen of a military friend, who knew him 
intimately. 

" Brigadier general Morgan was stout and active, 
six feet in height; strong, not too much encumbered 
with flesh, and was exactly fitted for the toils and 
pomp of war. His mind was discriminating and 
solid, but not comprehensive and combining. His 
manners plain and decorous, neither insinuating, nor 
repulsive. His conversation grave, sententious, and 
considerate, unadorned, and uncaptivating. He re- 
flected deeply, spoke little, and executed, with keen 
perseverance, whatever he undertook. He was in- 
dulgent, in his military command, preferring always 
the affections of his troops, , to that dread and awe, 
which surround the rigid disciplinarian/' 

A considerable time before his death, when the 
pressure of infirmity began to be heavy, he became 
seriously concerned, about his future welfare. From 
that period, his chief solace lay, in the study of the 
scriptures, and in devotional exercises. He died in 
the belief of the truths of Christianity, and in full 
communion with the Presbyterian church. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 169 

Another officer, destined to figure with great lus- 
tre, in the army of the south, was colonel William 
Washington. An honest soldier, brave as Ajax, and 
scarcely inferior, in personal strength, always impe- 
tuous, at times, perhaps, rash, in action, his sword 
was his idol; and he was calculated to execute, rather 
than plan. Leaving to others, the deliberations of 
the closet, he panted for the field; and his delight, 
there, was in the tumult of battle. Yet, when the 
nature of the service, he was engaged in, required 
it, he manifested, on several occasions, a ready ap- 
titude for the stratagems of war. This officer com- 
manded, now, a regiment of continental cavalry. 

He was the eldest son of Baily Washington, Esq., 
of Stafford county, in the state of Virginia; and be- 
longed to a younger branch, of the original Wash- 
ington family. 

In the commencement of the war, and at an early 
period of life, he had entered the army, as captain 
of a company of infantry, under the command of 
general Mercer. In this corps, he had acquired, from 
actual service, a practical knowledge of the profes- 
sion of arms. 

He fought in the battle of Long Island; and, in his 
retreat, through New Jersey, accompanied his great 
kinsman, cheerful under the gloom, coolly confront- 
1 

ing the danger, arid bearing, with exemplary fortitude 
and firmness, the heavy misfortunes, and privations, 
of the time. 

In the successful attack, on the British post at 
Trenton, captain Washington acted a brilliant, and • 
most important part. Perceiving the enemy, about to 
form a battery, and point it, in a narrow street, 
against the advancing American column, he charg- 
ed them, at the head of his company, drove them 
from their guns, and, thus, prevented, certainly, the 
effusion of much blood, perhaps, the repulse, of the 
assailing party. In this act of heroism, he received a 
severe wound, in the wrist. It is but justice to add, 
that, on this occasion, captain Washington was ably, 
and most gallantly supported, by lieutenant Monroe, 
now president of the United States, who also sus- 
tained a wound, in the hand. 

Shortly after this adventure, Washington was pro- 
moted to a majority, in a regiment of horse. In this 
command, he was very actively engaged, in the north- 
ern and middle states, with various success, until 
the year 1 780. Advanced to the rank of lieutenant- 
colonel, and placed, at the head of a regiment of ca- 
valry, composed of the remains of three, that had 
been reduced, by sickness and battle, he was, then, 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 171 

attached to the army, under general Lincoln, engaged 
in the defence of South Carolina. 

Here, his service was various, and his course 
eventful; marked, by a few brilliant strokes of for- 
tune, but checkered with two severe disasters. The 
first of these reverses, was at Monk's corner, where 
he himself commanded; the other, at Leneau's ferry, 
where he was second, in command, to colonel White. 

Inured to an uncommon extent and variety of hard 
service, and sufficiently disciplined, in the school of 
adversity, colonel Washington, although a young man, 
was, now, a veteran, in military experience. Added 
to this, he was somewhat accustomed to a warm 
climate, and had acquired, from actual observation 5 
considerable knowledge of that tract of country, 
which was to constitute, in future, the theatre of war. 

Such was this officer^ when, at the head of a re- 
giment of cavalry, he was attached to the army of 
general Greene. The most distinguished of his sub- 
sequent achievements, will be noticed in the regular 
course of our narrative. 

One of his partisan exploits, however, the result 
of a well conceived stratagem, must be succinctly 
narrated. 

Having learnt, during a scouting excursion, that a 
large party of loyalists, commanded by colonel Rudg- 
ley, was posted at Rudgley's mill, twelve miles from 
Camden, he determined on attacking them. 

Approaching the enemy, he found them so secur- 
ed, in a large log barn, surrounded by abbattis, as to 
be perfectly safe, from the operations of cavalry. 

Forbidden, thus, to attempt his object, by direct at- 
tack, his usual and favourite mode of warfare, he de- 
termined, for once, to have recourse to policy. 

Shaping, therefore, a pine log, in imitation of a 
field-piece, mounting it on wheels, and staining it with 
mud, to make it look like iron, he brought it up, in 
military style, and affected to make arrangements to 
batter down the barn. 

To give to the stratagem solemnity and effect, he 
despatched a flag, warning the garrison of the im- 
pending destruction, and, to prevent blood-shed, sum- 
moned them to submission. 

; 

Not prepared to resist artillery, colonel Rudgley 
obeyed the summons; and, with a garrison of one 
hundred and three, rank and file, surrendered at dis- 
cretion. 

In the spring of 1782, colonel Washington marri- 
ed Miss Elliot, of Charleston, and established himself 
at Sandy-Hill, her ancestral seat. 

After the conclusion of peace, he took no other 
concern, in public affairs, than to appear, occasional- 
ly, in the legislature of South Carolina 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 173 

When general Washington accepted the command 
in chief, of the armies of the United States, under the 
presidency of Mr. Adams, he selected, as one of his 
staff, his kinsman, colonel William Washington, with 
the rank of brigadier-general. Had other proof been 
wanting, this alone, was sufficient to decide his mi- 
litary worth. 

In private life, he was a man of unsullied honour, 
urfited to an amiable temper, lively manners, a hos- 
pitable disposition, and a benevolent heart. 

A third officer, of great distinction, in the south- 
ern army, was colonel Howard, of Baltimore. He 
commanded the second regiment of Maryland regu- 
lars; and, for gallantry and firmness, decision of cha- 
racter and sound judgment, was not exceeded, by 
any officer, of his rank, in the service of his country. 

With great intelligence, and skill in arms, he was 
one of those heroic spirits, on whom general Greene 
reposed his hopes, during the time he was deepest 
in adversity, and, in his high determination, to reco- 
ver the south, or perish in the attempt. 

Although he had been in commission, first, as cap- 
tain, and afterwards, as major, from the month of 
June, 1776, he does not appear to have been much 
engaged in action, until he took his station, at the 
head of a regiment, in the southern army. 



174 LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 

Accomplished in tactics, and ripe in experience^ 
although only, now, in his twenty-seventh year, he 
was, in all respects, fitted for the operations of the 
field. 

Accordingly, no sooner did an opportunity for ac- 
tion present itself \ than his valour, as a soldier, and 
his reputation, as a commander, became conspicuous, 
in the midst of the accomplished and the brave. 

His brightest laurel was gathered at the Cowpens, 
where, assuming to himself the responsibility of the 
act, he charged, without orders, and, at the point of 
the bayonet, discomfited and scattered, a party of the 
enemy, superior in number to his own command, 
and consisting of the flower of the British army. 

His interview, immediately after the action, with 
general Morgan, the commanding officer, was emi- 
nently interesting; and, were other evidence wanting, 
shows, on how precarious a footing, stands, the re- 
putation, and the life, of a warrior. 

" My dear Howard," said Morgan, cordially pres- 
sing his hand, as he spoke, "you have given me victo- 
ry, and I love and honour you; but, had you failed in 
your charge, which you risked without orders, I 
would have shot you." 

Previously to this, colonel Howard had distinguish- 
ed himself among those, who, by their gallantry and 
good conduct, had sustained the character of the 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 175 

American arms, and prevented the utter destruction 
of the forces, in the battle near Camden, where Gates 
was defeated. 

Nor was he entitled to less applause, for the spirit 
and judgment, which he afterwards displayed, at 
Guilford, Hobkirk's hill, and the Eutaw springs; at 
the latter of which, he was severely wounded. 

But a letter, from general Greene, dated Novem- 
ber 14th, 1781, to a friend, in Maryland, is conclusive, 
as to the military reputation of colonel Howard. 

"This will be handed to you, says the general, by 
colonel Howard, as good an officer, as the world af- 
fords. He has great ability, and the best disposition, 
to promote the service. My own obligations to him 
are great — the public's still more so. He deserves 
a statue of gold, no less than the Roman and Gre- 
cian heroes. He has been wounded, but has happily 
recovered, and now goes home, to pay a little atten- 
tion to his private affairs, and to take charge of the 
fifth Maryland regiment, recruiting in your state. 

With great respect, and esteem, 

I am, dear Sir, yours, 

N. Greene." 

Colonel Howard was born, June 4th, 1152, on his 
ancestral estate, near the city of Baltimore. His pa- 
ternal ancestors were from England, his maternal, 
from Ireland. The descendant of a gentleman, easy 
in circumstances, his education was such, as his rank 
and fortune entitled him to receive. 

On the conclusion of the war, he married Miss 
Chew, daughter of the honourable Benjaman Chew, 
of Philadelphia. 

Contented and happy, in domestic life, and much oc- 
cupied, with his private affairs, he has never sought po- 
. litical honours, but left to others to govern the coun- 
try, which he, by his valour, contributed to set free. 

He still resides on his patrimonial estate, surround- 
ed by a large and respectable family, pre-eminent in 
affluence, and passing the evening of his life, in that 
dignified and felicitous retirement, which a high and 
unsullied reputation, a peaceful conscience, a cultiva- 
ted intellect, and polished manners, alone can bestow. 

A fourth officer, uniting, in himself, all that gives 
dignity and worth to the private citizen, and excel- 
lence to the commander, was colonel Otho H. Wil- 
liams, also a native of the state of Maryland. 

This gentleman was formed for eminence in any 
station. His talents were of a high order, and his at- 
tainments, various and extensive. Possessing a person 
of uncommon symmetry, and peculiarly distinguished, 
by the elegance of his manners, he would have gra- 
ced, alike, a court or a camp. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 177 

Rich in that species of military science, which is 
acquired by experience, and a correct, systematic 
and severe disciplinarian, general Greene confided to 
him the important trust, of adjutant general to the 
southern army. The services, which in this, and 
other capacities, he rendered to that division of the 
American forces, in the course of their toilsome and 
perilous operations, were beyond all praise. 

He was born, in the county of Prince George, in 
the year 1748, and received, during his youth, but a 
slender education. This, he so much improved, by 
subsequent study, that few men had a finer taste, or 
a more cultivated intellect. 

He commenced his military career, as lieutenant 
of a rifle company, in 1775; and, in the course of the 
following year, was promoted to the rank of major, 
in a rifle regiment. 

In this corps, he very honourably distinguished 
himself, in the defence of fort Washington, on York 
Island, when assaulted by sir William Howe; and, on 
the surrender of that post, became a prisoner. 

Having suffered much, by close confinement, dur- 
ing his captivity, he was exchanged, for major Auck- 
land, after the capture of Burgoyne, and immediate- 
ly rejoined the standard of his country. 

z 



1 78 LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 

Being now promoted to the rank of colonel of a 
regiment of infantry, he was detached, under the ba- 
ron De Kalb, to the army of the south. 

General Gates having been appointed to the com- 
mand of this division of the American forces, he was 
present with that officer, at his defeat, before Cam- 
den; and, during the action, manifested great valour, 
and skill, in directing, and leading the operations 
against the enemy, while resistance was practicable; 
and, an equal degree of self-possession and address, 
in conducting the troops from the field, when compel- 
led to retreat. 

But, as an officer, his valour and skill, in battle, 
were among the lowest of his qualifications. His pe- 
netration and sagacity, united to a profound judg- 
ment, and a capacious mind, rendered him, in the 
cabinet, particularly valuable. 

Hence, he was one of general Greene's favourite 
counsellors, during the whole of his southern cam- 
paigns. Nor did any thing ever occur, either through 
neglect, or mistake, to impair the confidence, thus 
reposed in him. In no inconsiderable degree, he was 
to Greene, what that officer had been to general 
Washington, his strongest hope, in all emergencies, 
where great policy and address were required. 



LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 179 

This was clearly manifested, by the post assigned 
to him, by general Greene, during his celebrated re- 
treat, through North Carolina. 

In that great and memorable movement, on which 
the fate of the south was staked, to Williams was 
' confided the command of the rear guard, which was 
literally the shield and rampart of the army. Had he 
relaxed, but for a moment, in his vigilance and ex- 
ertion, or been guilty of a single imprudent act, ruin 
must have ensued. 

Nor was his command much less momentous, 
when, recrossing the Dan, Greene again advanced on 
the enemy. Still in the post of danger and honour, 
he now, in the van of the army, commanded the 
same corps, with which he had previously moved in 
the rear. But of these operations, it will be our bu- 
siness to speak more particularly hereafter. 

A military friend-, who knew him well, has given 
us the following summary of his character. 

" He possessed that range of mind, although self- 
educated, which entitled him to the highest military 
station, and was actuated by -true courage, which 
can refuse, as well as give battle. Soaring far above 
the reach of vulgar praise, he singly aimed at pro- 
moting the common weal, satisfied with the con- 
sciousness of doing right, and desiring only that 
share of applause. w r hich was justly his own. 
" There was a loftiness and liberality, in his char- 
acter, which forbade resort to intrigue and hypocrisy, 
in the accomplishment of his views, and rejected the 
contemptible practice, of disparaging others to exalt 
himself. 

" In the field of battle, he was self-possessed, in" 
telligent, and ardent; in camp, circumspect, attentive, 
and systematic; in council, sincere, deep, and per- 
spicuous. During the campaigns of general Greene, 
he was uniformly one of his few advisers, and held 
his unchanged confidence. Nor was he less esteemed 
by his brother officers, or less respected by his sol- 
diery." 

Shortly before the close of the war, he was pro- 
moted to the rank of brigadier-general. 

Another officer, attached to the southern army, in 
all respects worthy of his companions in arms, and 
of the glorious cause for which he was contending, 
was colonel Lee, of the cavalry. , 

By birth a Virginian, and descended from the 
most distinguished branch of the Lees, of that state, 
he possessed the lofty genius of his family, united to 
invincible courage and firmness, and all the noble 
enthusiasm of the warrior. 

But his ardour, brilliancy, and daring resolution, 
constituted but a part of his military worth. In him 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 181 

the fierce impetuosity of youth, was finely blended, 
with the higher and more temperate qualities of age. 
If he had, in his temperament, something of the elec- 
trical fire of Achilles, it was ennobled by the polished 
dignity of Hector, and repressed and moderated, by 
the wisdom of Nestor. 

For vigilance, intelligence, decision of character, 
skill in arms, a spirit of enterprise, and powers of 
combination, he had but few equals, youthful as he 
was, in the armies of his country. 

As ^tn officer of horse, and a partisan commander, 
perhaps he had no superior, on earth. 

That he was justly entitled to this encomium, ap- 
pears, as well from the extensive catalogue of his 
exploits, as from the high confidence, always repos- 
ed in him, by the commanding officer under whom 
he served. This is true, no less in relation to Wash- 
ington, than Greene. He was the intimate friend 
and confidant x>f both. The sentiments of the latter, 
with regard to him, are forcibly expressed, in the fol- 
lowing extract of a letter, dated February 18th, 1782. 

" Lieutenant colonel Lee retires, for a time, for 
the recovery of his health. I am more indebted to 
this officer, than to any other, for the advantages 
gained over the enemy, in the operations of the last 
campaign; and should be wanting in gratitude, not to 
acknowledge the importance of his services, a detail 
of which is his best panegyric." 

But, as it is intended, that a distinct memoir of 
his character shall appear hereafter, we forbear, for 
the present, to speak of hirn further.

laid, for the reconquest of the south — Greene's agency in the cap- 
ture of lord Cornwallis — Difficulty in settling his plan of future op- 
erations — opinions of his officers — determines to march to the south — 
His opinion of lord Cornwallis, and his probable movements. 



The soldier; when trained to arms, and practical- 
ly instructed in the details of his duty, is a mere in- 
strument in the hand of his officers. He is wielded, 
by them with as much facility, as he himself wields 
his musket or his sword. 

To render him efficient, in service, nothing is re- 
quisite, in himself, but good spirits, strength, activi- 
ty, and personal hardihood. All other qualities, use- 
ful in war, he derives from his commander. 

The captain infuses his own spirit into his com- 
pany, the major, into his battalion, the colonel, into 
his regiment, the general, into his division, the com- 
mander in chief, into his whole army, and, at the 
same time, communicates to their movements, the 
tone of his intellect. 

Good officers, therefore, never fail to make good 
soldiers; it being exceedingly rare, that well discip- 
lined troops, ever refuse, either to obey, or follow 
their leaders. 



LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 185 

Of these truths, no man was more sensible than 
general Greene. Hence, he no sooner became ac- 
quainted with them, than he sincerely rejoiced in the 
character of his officers; because, in them, he per- 
ceived the character of his army. " In relation to my 
regular troops, said he, to a confidential friend, I 
have but one wish — that they were more numerous. 
My officers are brave, intelligent, and skilful; I, also, 
flatter myself they are already attached to me: they 
will, therefore, give direction and efficiency to the 
soldiers. As to the militia, they are as good as 
any other undisciplined troops. They serve for 
numbers, show, and camp duty; but cannot be safe- 
ly relied on, in action. The utmost I expect or wish 
from them, in battle, is, to give and receive two 
or three fires, and, then, retreat in tolerable or- 
der. If they will do this, my regulars will do the rest/' 

Having performed the first duty of an able cap- 
tain, in making himself acquainted with the char- 
acter and capabilities of his own troops, his next was, 
to acquire a knowledge of those of his enemy. 

Of their number, which constitutes one of the 
elements of the capacity of an army, he was suffici- 
ently informed. Nor was he a stranger to the char- 
acter of lord Cornwallis, their commanding general, 

having previously studied it, in his northern cam- 

a a 
paigns; especially when opposed to him, in the state 
of New Jersey. Their troops he knew to be well 
disciplined, and well provided; he could, therefore, 
estimate their effective force. 

Having made the calculation, and found himself 
unable to meet them in the field, he resolved on a 
different mode of warfare. To induce him to this, 
superadded to the decision of his own judgment, he 
had before him two instructive examples — the con- 
duct of Washington, and the conduct of Gates. 

The former, by making his own views of expedi- 
ency the rule of his conduct, in defiance of public 
opinion and public censure, and by foregoing that 
temporary eclat, which might arise from a brilliant 
exploit, for the more solid and permanent renown, 
resulting from the attainment of a great object, had 
conquered, by delay, and by carefully selecting his 
time to strike. 

The latter, miscalculating, or not calculating at all, 

his own strength and that of his enemy, over-anxious 

to pluck a fresh laurel, or shrinking from the impu- 

, tations that might attach to retarded action, fought 

precipitately, and encountered ruin. 

With Washington in his eye, and his own genius 
to devise his measures, Greene resolved on cautious 
movements, and protracted war, 






LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 18? 

His great object was the recovery of the south; 
but his subordinate objects, as means towards this, 
were numerous. 

Although unable to meet his enemy, in general 
combat, yet, to sustain the spirit of the country, it 
was necessary that he should not altogether shun 
him; but, watching and confronting his scouts and 
foraging parties, fight, cripple, and beat, him, in de- 
tail. In these operations he had further in view, to 
straighten him, in his comforts and means of sub-: 
sistence. 

Nor were these the only points, that claimed his 
attention. 

The inhabitants of the surrounding country, were 
divided into three classes: the friends of freedom, the 
disaffected, and the wavering or neutral, residing, 
generally, in distinct settlements, situated somewhat 
remotely from each other. To manage these, to the 
best advantage, was a task of equal difficulty and 
importance. To protect the friendly settlements, and 
enable them safely to join his standard, to overawe the 
unfriendly, and prevent them from resorting to the 
standard of the enemy, and to preserve, at least, the 
neutrality of the wavering, and induce them, if pos- 
sible, to declare in his favour, — these objects, all of 
them necessary to insure success, in the great end of 
his operations and toils, required, for their achieve- 
ment, an extent, an intricacy and a nicety of com- 
bination, which none but a consummate leader could 
effect. 

To increase his difficulties, the tract of country, 
over which it was necessary that his influence should 
be felt, was exceedingly extensive, reaching six hun- 
dred miles, from the Dan to the St. Mary, and three 

hundred, from the Atlantic to the mountains. To 

» 
act on such a surface, with such a force, had never, 

perhaps, before, been attempted by man; and consti- 
tuted, therefore, a scheme of military operations, 
gigantic, beyond what history can furnish. 

To appoint officers precisely fitted for the various 
duties assigned to them; so to divide his troops, as to 
render detachments sufficiently strong, without too 
far 1 weakening the main body; to move unseen and 
strike unexpected; to menace one post of the enemy, 
in appearance, but another in reality; so to connect 
and arrange his operations, that action in one point, 
might be felt at a distance; and, to make such a ju- 
dicious selection of positions, as to be safe himself, 
while he endangered his adversary; such was the ar- 
duous, perhaps we might say, unexampled mode of 
warfare, which tried the genius, and awakened the 
resources, of the deliverer of the south. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 189 

In all his movements, it was necessary for him to 
maintain a communication with Virginia, from which 
he was ta receive supplies of provision, munitions, 
and men. 

But such was the fulness of his competency, as a 
commander, that Greene was never found deficient, 
where preparation was possible; nor supine, where 
vigilance was a military virtue. Ably seconded, by 
Marion, Sumpter, Pickins, and Davie, who, although 
rarely under his eye, were subject to his orders, he 
first arrested the current of conquest, and ultimately 
turned it back on the enemy, with a force that over- 
whelmed him. 

Shortly after taking command of the southern 
army, he was called on to exhibit his firmness and 
decision of character, no less, in relation to his own 
troops, than in his policy towards the enemy. 

He found, to his surprise, that owing to an alarm- 
ing laxity of discipline, the soldiers of the American 
army, had been in the practice, of leaving camp, 
without permission, visiting their homes, and often 
protracting their absence from duty, to the term of 
two or three weeks. 

To suppress this usage, so ruinous to the service, 
he proclaimed, in general orders, his determination, 



190 LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 

to punish, by death, the first delinquency of the kind 
that should be detected. 

Accordingly, a deserter, being taken, was shot, in 
presence of the army, which was drawn up to witness 
the spectacle. 

This single example proved sufficient. Without 
further trouble, the evil terminated. 

Early in December, general Greene received from 
lord Cornwallis, the following note. 

" I think proper to represent to you, that, the offi- 
cers and soldiers, taken at King's Mountain, were 
treated with an inhumanity scarcely credible. I find 
myself under the disagreeable necessity, of making 
some retaliation for those unhappy men, who were 
so cruelly and unjustly put to death, at Gilbert-town/' 

To this, the American commander returned the 
following answer. 

" I am too much a stranger to the transactions at 
Gilbert-town, to reply fully, on that subject. They 
must have been committed, before my arrival in the 
department, and by persons under the character of 
volunteers, who were independent of the army. How- 
ever, if there was any thing done, in that affair, con- 
trary to the principles of humanity, and the law of 
nations, and for which they had not the conduct of 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 191 

your army, as a precedent, I shall be ever ready to 
testify my disapprobation of it. 

"The first example was furnished, on your part, 
as appears by the list of unhappy sufferers inclosed; 
and it might have been expected, that the friends of 
the unfortunate would follow it. Punishing capitally, 
for a breach of military parole, is a severity, which the 
principles of modern war will not authorise; unless 
the inhabitants are to be treated as a conquered 
people, and subject to all the rigour of military go- 
vernment. The feelings of mankind will for ever 
decide, when the rights of humanity are invaded, 
I leave them to judge, of the tendency of your lord- 
ship's order to lieutenant colonel Balfour, after the 
action, near Camden; of lord Rawdon's proclamation; 
and, of Tarleton's laying waste the country, and dis- 
tressing the inhabitants, who were taught to expect 
protection and security, if they observed but neu- 
trality. 

" Sending the inhabitants of Charleston to St. 
Augustine, contrary to the articles of capitulation, is 
a violation, which I have also to represent, and whiGh 
I hope your lordship will think yourself bound to 
redress." 

This letter, replete with sound sense and unan- 
swerable argument, brought the matter to a close; 
lord Cornwallis neither retaliated, for supposed of- 
fences, nor remonstrated further. 

General Greene's first movement from the village 
of Charlotte, where he yet held his head quarters, 
was productive of the happiest effect. 

The British force, under lord Cornwallis, was sta- 
tioned at Winnsborough, and a strong detachment* 
under major general Leslie, was advancing on Cam- 
den. 

General Greene, with his main army, marched, 
in the month of December, to the Cheraw Hills, 
about seventy miles to the right of lord Cornwallis, 
despatching, at the same time, general Morgan, with 
four hundred continentals under colonel Howard, 
colonel Washington's corps of dragoons, and a few 
militia, amounting in all to about six hundred, to 
take a position on the British left, distant from 
them about fifty miles. 

This judicious disposition, which formed a<rallying 
point, for the friends of independence, both in the 
east and the west, and facilitated the procurement of 
provision for the troops, excited his lordship's appre- 
hensions, for the safety of Ninety-six and Augusta, 
British posts, which he considered as menaced, by 
the movements of Morgan. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 193 

This gave rise to a train of movements, which ter- 
minated in the celebrated battle of the Cowpens. 

From the whigs of the neighbouring country, who 
were equally encouraged and gratified by its pre- 
sence, the western column of Greene's army was re- 
ceiving daily accessions of strength. Alarmed at this, 
and at the boldness and success of several of its enter- 
prizes, and somewhat offended at the proximity of its 
position, lord Cornwallis formed a resolution to frus- 
trate its views, and punish its temerity, by driving 
it from the country, or effecting its destruction. 
s Pursuant to this, colonel Tarleton, with a strong 
detachment, amounting, in horse and foot, to near a 
thousand, was despatched, by his lordship, to the 
protection of Nijxety-six, with orders, to bring gene- 
ral Morgan, if possible, to battle. 

To the ardent temper, and chivalrous disposition 
of the British colonel, this direction was perfectly 
congenial. Greatly superior in numbers, he advanc- 
ed on Morgan, with a menacing aspect, and compell- 
ed him, at first, to fall back rapidly. 

But the retreat of the American commander, was 
not long continued. Irritated by pursuit, reinforced by 
a body of militia, under general Pickens, and repos- 
ing great confidence, in the spirit and firmness of 

nis regular troops, he halted at the Cowpens, and. 

b b 



194 ' LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 

after consulting his officers, and finding their wishes 
in unison with his own, determined to gratify his 
adversary, in his eagerness for combat. 

This was on the night of the sixteenth of January 
1781. Early in the morning of the succeeding day, 
Tarleton, being apprised of the position of Morgan, 
pressed towards him with redoubled rapidity, lest, 
by renewing his retreat, he should again elude him. 

But, by neglecting to study the character of his 
adversary, this high spirited warrior committed an 
error, which blasted his laurels, and humbled his 
pride. 

Morgan, now, had other thoughts, than those of 
flight. Already had he, for several days, been at war 
with himself, in relation to his conduct. Glorying 
in action, his spirit recoiled from the humiliation of 
retreat, and his resentment was roused by the inso- 
lence of pursuit. This mental conflict becoming 
more intolerable to him than disaster or death, his 
courage triumphed, perhaps, over his prudence, and 
he resolved on putting every thing to the hazard of 
the sword. 

Nor had he been, in any measure, judicious in the 
selection of his ground. His position was open, and 
practicable for cavalry, in which the enemy trebled 
him in number. His flanks, being unprotected, might 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 195 

be readily turned, and, Broad river, running parallel 
in his rear, forbade retreat, in case of misfortune. 
Thus situated, his defeat and ruin were to be consi- 
dered inseparable. Notwithstanding this, trusting to 
his fortune and superior soldiership, he appeared to 
have a confident anticipation of victory. 

By military men, who have studied the subject, 
his disposition for battle is said to have been masterly. 
The following perspicuous and succint account of it, 
is given by general Lee. 

" Two light parties of militia, under major M'Dow- 
el, of North Carolina, and major Cunningham, of 
Georgia, were advanced in front, with orders to feel 
the enemy as he approached; and, preserving a desul- 
tory well aimed fire as they fell back to the front 
line, to range with it and renew the conflict. The 
main body of the militia composed this line, with ge- 
neral Pickens at its head. At a suitable distance in 
the rear of the first line, a second was stationed, com- 
posed of the continental infantry and two companies 
of Virginia militia, under captains Triplet and Taite, 
commanded by lieutenant colonel Howard. Wash- 
ington's cavalry, reinforced with a company of mount- 
ed militia, armed with sabres, was held in reserve; 
convenient to support the infantry, and protect the 



196 ' LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 

horses of the rifle militia, which were tied, agreeably 
to usage, in the rear." 

In the common acceptation of the term, and on 
ordinary occasions, Morgan was no orator. But the 
present conjuncture, big with the fate of his army 
and himself, had aroused the secret energies of his 
soul, and given to his intellect unusual fire. 

Availing himself of the solemn interval, between 
the last act of preparation, and the first of combat, 
he passed along his line, with a firm and cheerful 
countenance, forcibly and eloquently exhorting his 
troops, with topics of argument and address judi- 
ciously adapted to their character and feeling. 

To the militia he pictured their families and their 
homes, and the valour they had often displayed in 
defence of them, even when unsupported by veteran 
troops. The reputation they had already established, 
he was confident they would not forfeit, now, when 
led by himself, and sustained by infantry and caval- 
ry, of experience and renown. He represented, to 
them, his long tried fortune, in war. This, he declar- 
ed, had never forsaken him, under circumstances so 
promising and auspicious as the present. By rifle- 
men, in no respect, superior to themselves, he had 
often scattered or brought to submission, an enemy 
much more formidable than that which was advanc- 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 197 

iiig — an enemy led by a veteran, not by a youth, 
without experience. He, finally, exhorted them to 
be firm and steady; to point their fire, with well di- 
rected aim, and pour in but two skilful volleys, at 
striking distance, and, by the aid of their veteran 
companions, the victory would be secure. 

To the continentals, his address was brief. He re- 
minded them of the confidence he had always repos- 
ed in them; that he considered them among the best 
troops in service, and that his mortification would be 
infinite, should they now disappoint him: he assured 
them that firmness and good conduct, on their part, 
would render victory certain; and desired them not 
to be disconcerted, by the retreat of the militia, " that 
being a part of his plan and orders." 

Posting himself, then, in the line of the regulars, 
he waited, in silence, the advance of the enemy. 

Tarleton coming in sight, hastily formed his dis- 
position for battle, and commenced the assault. Of 
this conflict, the following picture is from the pen of 
general Lee. 

" The American light parties quickly yielded, fell 
back, and arrayed with Pickens. The enemy, shout- 
ing, rushed forward upon the front line, which re- 
tained its station, and poured in a close fire; but con- 
tinuing to advance with the bavonet on our militia. 
they retired and gained, with haste, the second line. 
Here, with part of the corps, Pickins took post on 
Howard's right, and the rest fled to their horses; 
probably with orders to remove them to a further dis- 
tance. Tarleton pushed forward, and was received 
by his adversary with unshaken firmness. The con 1 
test became obstinate; and each party, animated by 
the example of its leader, nobly contended for victory, 
Our line maintained itself so firmly, as to oblige the 
enemy to order up his reserve. The advance of 
M'Arthur reanimated the British line, which again 
moved forward; and, outstretching our front endan- 
gered Howard's right. This officer instantly took 
measures to defend his flank, by directing his right 
company to change its front; but, mistaking this 
order, the company fell back; upon which the line 1 
began to retire, and general Morgan directed it to 
retreat to the cavalry. This manoeuvre being per- 
formed with precision, our flank became relieved, 
and the new position was assumed with promptitude. 
Considering this retrograde movement the precursor 
of flight, the British line rushed on with impetuosity 
and disorder; but as it drew near, Howard faced 
about, and gave it a close and murderous fire. Stun- 
ned by this unexpected shock, the most advanced of 
the enemy recoiled in confusion. Howard seized the 



LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 199 

happy moment, and followed his advantage with the 
bayonet. This decisive step gave us the day. The re- 
serve having been brought near the line, shared in 
the destruction of our fire, and presented no rallying 
point to the fugitives. A part of the enemy's cavalry, 
having gained our rear, fell on that portion of the 
militia who had retired to their horses. Washington 
struck at them with his dragoons, and drove them 
before him. Thus, by a simultaneous effort, the in- 
fantry and cavalry of the enemy were routed. Mor- 
gan pressed home his success, and the pursuit be- 
came vigorous and general. The British cavalry 



having taken no part in the action, except the two 
troops attached to the line, were in force to cover the 
retreat. This, however, was not done. The zeal of 
lieutenant colonel Washington in pursuit having car- 
ried him far before his squadron, Tarleton turned 
upon him with a troop of the seventeenth regiment of 
dragoons, seconded by many of his officers. The Ame- 
rican lieutenant colonel was first rescued from this 
, critical contest by one of his sergeants, and after- 
wards by a fortunate shot from his bugler's pistol.' • 

" In this decisive battle we lost about seventy men, 
of whom twelve only were killed. The British infan- 
try, with the exception of the baggage guard, were 
nearly all killed or taken. One hundred, including 
ten officers, were killed; twenty-three officers and 
five hundred privates were taken. The artillery, 
eight hundred muskets, two standards, thirty-five 
baggage wagons, and one hundred*%dragoon horses, 
fell into our possession/' > 

The result of this action, so beneficial to the coun- 
try, and so signally glorious to the American arms, 
was attributable, chiefly, to two causes; the judgment 
and skill of colonel Howard, and the precipitancy and 
want of judgment, of colonel Tarleton. 

The former, seizing the critical moment, confound- 
ed and staggered the enemy, by a terrible fire; and, 
then, pressing him with the bayonet, consummated 
his overthrow. 

The latter, in the opinion of military men, com- 
mitted a variety of faults. Instead of halting, to refresh 
and invigorate his troops, he hurried them into action, 
without the least necessity, when they were fatigued 
and exhausted. He permitted them to advance, in an 
irregular and unsoldierly manner, when the first line * 
of the militia fell back; he neglected to charge the 
broken and retreating militia, with his dragoons; dnd, 
when he ordered up his reserve, brought it complete- 
ly within the range of Howard's fire, so as to expose 
it equally with the front line, and, thus, forego the 
advantage to be derived from it. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. ,201 

Another act of colonel Howard, in this engage- 
ment, manifested uncommon coolness, sagacity and 
self-command; and is believed to have contributed,^ 
in no small degree, to the issue of the day. 

After having thrown the British line into confu- 
sion, by his fire and unexpected charge, he called 
out to them, ip a loud and commanding voice, to 
surrender, and they should receive "good quarters/' 

On this summons, five hundred of them instant- 
ly threw down their arms. 

The victory of the Cowpens, although achieved „ 
under the immediate command of Morgan, was the , 
first stroke of general Greeners policy, in the south; 
and augured favourably of his future career. It led , 
to one of the most arduous, ably-conducted, and me- 
morable operations, that occurred in the course of 
the revolutionary war — the retreat of Greene, and 
the pursuit of lord Cornwallis, during the inclemen- 
cies of winter, from the Catawba to the Dan, a dis- 
tance of two hundred and thirty miles. 

On the part of the American commander, that re- 
treat, with his advance, manoeuvres, and action at 
Guilford, which soon afterwards followed, may be , 
safely pronounced, with the exception, perhaps, of 
the retreat of the ten thousand Greeks, a succession, 

ef as masterly movements, as are recorded in the 

c c 
page of military history. For any but a genius of the 
highest order, and a soul of the firmest texture, to 
have planned, and achieved such a scheme of opera- 
tions, would have been impossible. 

Except in the number and equipment of the for- 
ces in motion, and the eclat arising from that cir- 
cumstance, it is, certainly, in no respect surpassed by 
the retreat o£ Moreau, through the defiles of Germa- 
ny, which called forth the admiration and applauses 
of Europe, and placed that officer at the head of the 
captains , of the' French empire. 

As the transactions of this conjuncture, more se- 
verely, perhaps, than those of any other period of his 
life, tested the abilities of general Greene, and threw 
on his renown its brightest lustre, an account of 
them, somewhat circumstantial, is due to his me- 
mory. 

Galled, in his pride, and crippled, in his schemes, 
by the overthrow of Tarleton, lord Cornwallis resol- 
ved, by a series of prompt and vigorous measures, to 
avenge the injury, and retrieve the loss, which the 
royal arms had sustained, at the Cowpens. In his me- 
ditated plan of operations, for this purpose, he em- 
braced three objects: to advance rapidly on Morgan, 
retake his prisoners, and destroy his force; to main- 
tain an intermediate position, and prevent his union 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 203 

with general Greene; or, in case of the junction of 
the two divisions of the army, to cut off their retreat 
towards Virginia, and force them to action, south of 
the Dan. 

He and Morgan were both on the west, Greene, 
on the east side of the Catawba. 

His lordship, having committed to the flames his 
heavy baggage, and reduced to the condition of light 
troops, his whole army, dashed towards Morgan, to 
strike him, before he could pass that river. 

But the American commander, no less vigilant 
and provident than himself, plainly foreseeing what 
his movements would be, hastened his march, and 
had made good his passage of the river, just as the 
British van arrived at the bank. 

General Greene, apprized of the movement of lord 
Cornwallis, and apprehending that his object was to 
pass into his rear, and cut off his communication 
with Virginia, put his army, also, in motion, towards 
the north. But, an express arriving, with information 
of the defeat of Tarleton, he instantly perceived, that 
his lordship^s first object, was the overthrow of Mor- 
gan and the recapture of his prisoners. 

Ordering his troops to proceed, under general 

F 

Hugher, on their march towards Salisbury, where 
he meditated a junction with the detachment of Mo r- 
gan, he himself, escorted by a few dragoons, set out 
for the head-quarters of that officer, and joined him, 
a few hours after he had crossed the Catawba. 

Despatching the prisoners for safety, under a guard 
of militia, towards the northern states, these two of- 
ficers prepared to dispute with his lordship, the pas- 
sage of the river; and, if possible, retard his advance, 
until the troops under general Hugher should reach 
Salisbury. > 

Fortunately a sudden swell of the Catawba, in con- 
sequence of a copious fall of rain, detained the 
British, for two days, on its western bank, and pla- 
ced the prisoners, captured at the Cowpens, entirely 
beyond the prospect of rescue. This occurrence was 
hailed by the pious, as an interposition of Providence 
in behalf of America. 

Early in the morning of the third day, being the 
first of February 1781, the enemy effected their pas- 
sage, in several columns, at as many different fords, 
and forced the Americans again to fall back. 

Here commenced the retreat of general Greene, 
m the course of which, he displayed such resources, 
and gained, in the e;id, such lasting renown. 

Sensible of the immense prize, for which he was 
contending, he tasked, to the utmost, his genius, in 
the struggle. On its issue was staked, not merely 



LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 205 

the lives of a few brave men — not, alone, the exist- 
ence of a whole army; but, the fate of the south, and 
the integrity of the union. For, should the American 
forces now be cut off, it was inevitable, that the 
three southern states, at least, must be re-annexed to 

the British empire. 

i 

So eager and rapid was the advance of lord Corn- 
wallis, that general Greene, perceiving he would reach 
Salisbury, before the division of the army, under 
general Hugher, sent orders, by express, to that of- 
ficer, to march, with all possible despatch, by a more 
direct route, to Guilford court-house, where he pro- 
mised to join him, with the division under Morgan. 

Much rain having fallen, and the soil of the coun- 
try consisting of a tough, red clay, interspersed with 
rounded stones, the roads were rendered inexpres- 
sibly bad. Notwithstanding this, general Greene, 
pushing his retreat, with great activity, crossed the 
Yadkin, a broad and rapid rjyer, fifty miles distant 
from the Catawba, on the night ofthe second. So close 
was the pursuit, at this point, that, when about to 
embark, his rear guard was fiercely assaulted, by the 
British van. Jt sustained, however, no damage. 
Here, again, the American commander having se- 
cured the boats, and the river being swollen, by the 
late rains, the enemy experienced a further detention. 

To his great mortification, lord Cornwallis now 
perceived, that in two of his objects, the destruction 
of Morgan's detachment, and the prevention of its 
union with the main division, he was completely frus- 
trated, by the activity of Greene. But, to intercept 
the retreat of the Americans, after their union, and 
compel them to action, south of the Dan, was still 
perhaps practicable. To the achievement of this, 
as his last hope, he now directed his undivided ener- 
gies. 

Moving to the head-branches of the Yadkin, where 
its waters were fordable, he threw himself over it, 
and, by forced marches, bent his course towards the 
Upper Dan. 

In pressing for that point, his lordship manifested 
sound policy, and correct calculation. 

His present position enabled him to reach the Up- 
per Dan, before general Greene ; the waters of the 
Lower Dan could not be forded, on account of the late 
rains; and he believed it impracticable, to procure 
boats sufficient for the transportation of the Ameri- 
can troops. In his estimation, therefore, battle was 
certain. 






LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 207 

But the full extent of his adversary^ resources had 
not yet been disclosed to him. 

The expected junction of his troops, at Guilford 
court-house, being safely effected, on the seventh of 
the month, general Greene, on examining his force, 
found himself still too weak, to hazard an engage- 
ment. His safety, therefore, consisted in the continu- 
ance of retreat. 

Fresh difficulties now presenting themselves, new 
arrangements became necessary to meet them. 

From the position held by lord Cornwallis, to reach 
and pass the Upper Dan, was altogether impractica- 
ble. The Lower Dan might be attained, without mo- 
lestation; and, probably, also a sufficiency of boats, 
for passing it, procured. But the transportation of 
an army was a work' of time. Should the enemy, 
therefore, be pressing on his rear, when he might 
reach the river, great loss, in baggage and stores, 
must necessarily be sustained, in attempting its pas- 
sage. A portion of his troops must also be sacrificed, 

Such was the situation, and such the reasoning, of 
the American commander, at this most trying and 
eventful conjuncture. 

A cloud of adversity so gloomy and procellous, has 
rarely overshadowed a military leader. But the geni- 
us of Greene, was neither to be obscured by its 
darkness, nor his energies deadened by its threaten- 
ing aspect. Self-collected, and adapting his conduct 
to the nature of the crisis, his firmness grew with 
the increase of danger; and the measure of his great- 
ness, was the extent of the difficulties he was called 
to encounter. 

The plan he pursued, on the present occasion, 
was the only one that could have saved his army; 
and this he devised and adopted, with great prompt- 
ness. 

Determined to attempt the Dan, at Irwin's ferry* 
and having designated the route most practicable 
and proper for the army to follow, he despatched 
colpnel Carrington, his quarter-master general, a 
most intelligent and able officer, to collect boats, 
and make all other necessary arrangements for cros- 
sing. 

But, for the completion of his scheme of retreat, 
another measure was yet to be added. 

To secure the safety of his army, it was necessa- 
ry that he should receive, at short intervals, correct 
information of lord CornwalhVs position and move- 
ments: to promote its comfort, it was requisite that 
its rear should be protected, in its march, from re- 
peated assaults: and, to enable it to pass the Dan, 
without being seriously injured, during its transport- 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 209 

ation, it was essential, that, on its arrival there, it 
should be considerably in advance of the enemy's 
van. 

For the attainment of these objects, general Greene 
formed a corps of light troops, amounting, to seven 
hundred, composed of a select body of infantry, un- 
der colonel Howard, Washington's cavalry, Lee's 
legion, and a few of his best militia riflemen. 

General Morgan having, for reasons, which were 
never deemed satisfactory, declined the proffered 
honour of leading this detachment, the command of 
it was given to colonel Williams. Every act of that 
high minded soldier proved, that an officer more ca- 
pable and worthy of so elevated and important a trust 
could not have been selected, from the American 
army. 
Y His orders were, in the words of one of his asso- 
ciates in arms, who acted a conspicuous part on the 
occasion, " to take post between the retreating and 
the advancing army, to hover round the skirts of the 
latter, to seize every opportunity of striking in detail, 
and to retard the enemy, by vigilance and judicious 
positions; while Greene, with the main body, should 
hasten towards the Dan, the boundary of his present 

toils and dangers." 

d d 
The fitness of general Morgan for such a service 
is exceedingly doubtful. Much more enamoured of 
action than policy, and, of a temper too stern and 
irritable, to submit to the tcazing of repeated petty 
attacks, and the galling impression of close and in- 
solent pursuit, there is reason to apprehend, that he 
would have turned on his adversary, in a moment of 
resentment, and, obedient to the impulse of valour, 
rather than to the dictates of prudence, or the or- 
ders of his superior, endangered both his own detach- 
ment, and the main army. His refusal, therefore, 
of the command, was probably fortunate. 

Colonel Williams, on the other hand, was peculi- 
arly adapted to the station assigned him. Of an ex- 
panded, enlightened, and well regulated intellect, pos- 
sessing the attribute of self command, in a degree 
that was unusual, and being no less vigilant and 
circumspect, than decisive and bold, he was of a 
temperament of mind equally prone to action or 
policy, as circumstances demanded. He never haz- 
arded any thing, unless when necessary for the pro- 
motion of the service, to which he was appointed; 
and, then, he risked both himself and his troops, 
with a gallantly of spirit, and a generous enthusiasm, 



LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 211 

that nothing could surpass. His conduct, in the pre- 
sent crisis, justifies fully this tribute to his memory. 

Having completed his arrangement, general 
Greene placed himself at the head of his army, and 
actively pursued his retreat towards the Dan. 

From this moment, the detachment under colonel 
Williams, presented a spectacle, which, although 
witnessed by many persons, now living, cannot be 
denied to exhibit, in the recital, almost as much of 
the extravagance cf fiction, as of the sobriety of fact. 

Forgetful of themselves, and bent exclusively on 
the preservation of those, they were appointed to 
protect, these brave troops, confronted difficulty and 
danger, and submitted to privation and hardship, 
with a persevering loyalty, and a self-devotedness, 
that have scarcely a parallel in the records of war. 

So close and uninterrupted was the pursuit, that 
one meal a day, was all the sustenance they had lei- 
sure to take; and, so severe, at night, was their du- 
ty, in picquets and patroles, that six hours' sleep, out 
of forty-eight, was all the repose they were permitted 
to enjoy. This, with marching through deep and 
heavy roads, exposure to cold and rainy w 7 eather, 
and frequent skirmishing with the pursuing foe, 
would seem to carry hardship to the utmost height, 
that humanity could bear. 



2X2 LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 

Yet, were these soldiers of freedom, cheerful, 
healthy, and apparently happy. Proud of their sit- 
uation, they would not have exchanged it, until the 
completion of the service, for all the fruition, that 
the ease and abundance of home could afford. Such 
are the charms of danger and suffering, when in- 
curred in the discharge of an honourable trust; and 
so much can the valiant and the high minded sustain, 
when actuated by duty, and attracted by glory. 

So immediate, during a considerable portion of 
one day, was the proximity of colonel Williams to the 
enemy, and, weary of unavailing conflict, so peaceable 
was the demeanour of the parties towards each other, 
that a stranger would have supposed them to be sec- 
tions of the same army. Except in crossing a stream 
or in passing a defile, the pursuers made no attempt 
to molest. 

Greene having effected his passage of the Dan, on 
the morning of the thirteenth, and Williams, on the 
evening of the same day, they met, on the opposite 
shore, with mutual congratulations; and, free from 
danger, permitted their troops to repose from their 
toils, to shelter themselves from the weather, and to 
enjoy plenty. 

Frustrated thus, in all his purposes, throughout 
this long and arduous movement, lord Cornwallis, 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 213 

although the pursuing party, must be acknowledged 
to have been fairly vanquished, in the contest. 

Victory is the successful issue of a struggle for 
superiority. Military leaders contend for different 
objects; to vanquish their enemies, in open combat; 
to attack and overthrow them, by stratagem and sur- 
prise; to exhaust their resources, by delay of action; 
or, to elude them, in retreat, until, strengthened by 
reinforcements, they may be able to turn and meet 
them, in the field. 

These several modes of warfare, require different 
means, for their successful execution. The first, 
calls specifically for the sword, which is wielded by 
the physical strength of the army: the three last are 
conducted, more exclusively, by the genius of the 
commanders. Here, intellectual is substituted for 
physical power; military policy, for military force. 

We shall not pause to inquire, in which of these 
forms of war, a victory is most creditable to the tal- 
ents of a leader. Among civilized and enlightened 
nations, the point is already decided. Wherever . 
mind is preferred to matter, the victory of genius, 
will always take an ascendency over that of the 
sword. 

When it is our purpose to attach to a commander 
a moderate reputation, we denominate him^ a rt good 
fighting officer;" meaning, by this, that he has more 
of animal courage and personal activity, than of intel- 
lect and combination. v 

A victory gained in the field, is accompanied by 
the pomp and pageantry of battle. It is broad and 
dazzling, and has strong attractions for the common 
mind. But, genius, in effecting a victory, works less 
ostentatiously; and the merit of the achievement is 
recognized, only, by the discerning and the intel- 
ligent. 

Were it requisite, further to illustrate this point, 
we might add, that the more vulgar entertainments 
of the stage, exhibited in the midst of rich and gor- 
geous scenery, attract and highly delight the multi- 
tude; while the elevated and exquisite productions 
of the Drama, represented in the chaste simplicity 
of nature, are relished only where sound judgment 
and taste predominate. 

To estimate the talents of a general officer, then, 
by the number and extent of the battles he has fought, 
and even won, is a vulgar error. He, on the other 
hand, is a leader of talents, who conquers by policy; 
who, substituting his own genius for the sword of his 
army, spares, as much as possible, the blood of his 
troops, fighting only when necessary, or when, by 



LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 215 

gaining an advantage, he is enabled to strike with 
decisive effect. 

Hence the fallacy of the opinion, too prevalent 
even in our own country, that, because the military 
leaders of Europe have shed more blood, and con- 
sumed more gun-powder, than those of America, 
they must, therefore, be possessed of superior abili- 
ties. 

Such a sentiment corresponds, sufficiently, with 
the state and condition of savage tribes, where a 
leader is selected, on account of his personal prow- 
ess and strength. But, in an enlightened nation, 
where genius is the predominant attribute of the com- 
mander, it ought not to be tolerated. 

The victory, then, of general Greene, over lord 
Cornwallis, in his memorable retreat, from the Ca- 
tawba to the Dan, although less splendid, is equally 
creditable, with that achieved over the same officer, 
by the sword of Washington, within the ramparts of 
Yorktown. Were it not for the policy and address, 
exhibited by the commander in chief, when prepar- 
ing to invest the British leader, which throw their 
lustre on the subsequent conquest we should not 
hesitate to pronounce it more creditable. 

To render the success of Greene's retreat the 
more signal, in itself, and the more honourable to 
its conductor, the country through which he pas- 
sed, superabounded in royalists, much more inclined 
to withhold, than to furnish resources, to deceive 
than to communicate correct information, and to re- 
tard, than promote the movements of the army. The 
food of his troops was deficient, in quantity; their clo- 
thing much more so. Their shoes were worn out, and 
they had but one blanket to four men. The weather 
was tempestuous and cold, rain and snow alternate- 
ly falling, in considerable quantities, during the re- 
treat. 

The British troops, on the contrary, were amply 
provided in food and clothing; anil had as much 
camp equipage, as, at the commencement of their 
march, they had chosen to retain. So g* eat was the 
difference, in point of comfort, between t he retreat- 
ing and the pursuing army. 

The exertions made by the royal, to compel the 
American commander, to action, could not, in wisdom 
and energy, have been surpassed. 

Such were the difficulties encountered and van- 
quished, by the hero of the south. 

To crown the whole, no loss was sustained, by 
him either in men, munitions, artillery, or any thing 
that enters into the equipment of an army. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 217 

Just, in his measures, and sensible of the influence 
of merited applause on the minds of the generous, 
Greene, on the north of the Dan, expressed in ge- 
neral orders, his obligations to his whole army, and, 
with nice discrimination, bestowed on officers and 
soldiers, the special commendations to which their 
services entitled them. 

On this occasion, he recognized, with marked dis- 
tinction, the exemplary conduct of the colonels, Wil- 
liams, Carrington, and Lee. 

Deeply chagrined, at being surpassed in general- 
ship, by the American commander, lord Cornwailis 
resolved, notwithstanding, to profit by the events that 
had recently occurred. 

Having compelled general Greene to a temporary 
abandonment of North Carolina, he affected to con- 
sider the state as conquered, and reannexed to the 
British empire. To his credit it must be acknowl- 
edged, that this was a measure, not only allowable 
in war, but perfectly worthy of an enlightened cap- 
tain, whose duty required him, to secure, by policy, 
what he had acquired by power. Nor did he mani- 
fest less judgment, in attempting its execution. 

The country around Hillsborough, but more es- 
pecially to the southward and westward of it, was 

deeply disaffected towards the cause of freedom. 

e e 



218 LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 






Establishing his head-quarters in that town, his lord- 
ship erected there the royal standard, calling on all 
faithful subjects to repair to it, without delay; and 
warning the rebellious to be equally prompt, in re- 
turning to their loyalty, claiming protection, and re- 
ceiving pardon. 

Aware of the fatal tendency of this system, unless 
immediately met by countervailing nieasures, gene- 
ral Greene, whose sagacity and judgment, in milita- 
ry matters, rarely failed him, without waiting for his 
expected succours from Virginia, determined to re- 
cross the Dan, and dispute the sovereignty of North 
Carolina, on its own soil. 

Preparatory to this, to reconnoitre the position 
and movements of the enemy, to hold in check the 
spirit of disaffection, and sustain the hopes and ex- 
ertions of his friends by showing that the state was 
not surrendered, to intercept such bodies of royalists 
as might be on their march to Hillsborough, and to 
procure intelligence, generally, he despatched over 
the Dan, a corps of light troops, composed of infan- 
try, riflemen, and cavalry, under the command of 
colonel Lee. 

The more fully to impart to that officer his plan 
of operations, and to impress him the more deeply 
with the importance of vigilance and great circum- 



# LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 219 

spection, he left his position, north of the Dan, and, 
crossing thafriver, under a small escort of dragoons, 
risked his person, in passing through a hostile set- 
tlement, and overtook him, at the distance of more 
than twenty miles from head-quarters. After continu- 
ing a night with him, most of it spent in a free and 
solemn conference, and in communicating his final 
instructions and advice, he returned to the army, and 
Lee proceeded on the business of his command. 

The correctness of the apprehensions of Greene, 
and the wisdom of the measures he had just adopted, 
were soon apparent: for Lee had been but a few 
days, on the south of the Dan, when he encountered, 
cut to pieces, and dispersed, a body of five hundred 
tories, repairing to the royal standard, under the 
command of colonel Pyle. 

In its consequences, this stroke was exceedingly 
felicitous. Intelligence of it being conveyed, by the 
survivors, to all parts of the country, each straggling 
individual protesting, that he alone, of all the party, 
had escaped the sword, the tories who were prepar- 
ing to assemble in arms, were struck with dismay, and 
their exertions in favour of royalty, paralysed. 

Uneasy and restless, in a state of quietude, while 
the interests of his country called for action, general 
Greene, having completed his arrangements with the 



220 LrFE OF GENERAL GREENE. » 

government of Virginia, for supplies of troops, pro- 
visions, and military stores, recrossed the Dan with 
his army, on the 23d of February, being the tenth 
day, after the termination of his celebrated retreat. 

In the tract of country, lying between the Haw 
and Deep rivers, was situated an extensive and 
thickly populated settlement, consisting almost en- 
tirely of royalists. The more effectually to overawe 
these, and deter them from repairing to the British 
standard, the American commander moving to the 
South, took a position, in the centre of the settlement. 

With a view to favour and promote what general 
Greene had made arrangements to prevent, lord 
Cornwallis, about the same time, advancing from 
Hillsborough, marched his army into the same quar- 
ter. 

Here, again, were these two great commanders, 
equal to any the age had produced, in the vicinity of 
each other, resolutely bent on mutual embarrass- 
ment, circumvention, and overthrow. To induce the 
royalists of the place, to flock to his standard, was 
the object and wish of the British chief; because, 
without such addition, his force must diminish, by the 
operations of war; to prevent this, and, at the same 
time, to protect his friends, and encourage them to 
rally around the banner of freedom, was the end of 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 221 

the American. Thus, was each leader forbidden, by 
his views of interest and expediency, to abandon to 
the other this section of country. 

Already had they contended, in a trial of skill, and 
Greene had proved superior. It was obvious, now, 
that they must shortly encounter, in a trial with the 
sword. Success in this, depending much on the in- 
fluence of accident, could not be reached by human 
calculation. 

As yet general Greeners expected reinforcements 
had not arrived. Still, therefore, was he unable to 
cope with his adversary in the field. For a time, 
then, he must avoid battle, but not retreat. Hence 
arose a second trial of military skill, more compli- 
cated, and not less interesting and important, than 
that which had been terminated by the passage^ of 
the Dan. 

Neither army had erected fortifications, of any de- 
scription; and the country being level, and not much 
intersected by streams of water, presented nothing 
that could be technically denominated a natural 
stronghold. In avoiding action, therefore, the Ameri- 
can commander must place his reliance, on his own 
vigilance, and skill in movement. 

To secure intelligence, and guard against surprise, 
Greene threw into his front the same light corps, 



222 LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 

which had previously constituted his rear; and en- 
trusted the command to the same officer. 

It was now about the beginning of March. Here 
commenced the second essay in military policy, 
which, within a small tract of country, was continu- 
ed, by marches, counter-marches, feints, selections of 
positions, and every other stratagem that genius could 
devise, until the tenth or eleventh of the month, when 
lord Cornwallis, convinced of the impracticability of 
either bringing his enemy to action, or forcing him to 
retreat, gave up the contest. During this period, the 
American leader changed his place of encampment 
twice, at least, every twenty-four hours; frequently 
oftener; so that, at times, the British commander did 
not know where to find him; and was afraid of being 
himself attacked by surprise. 

On the part of general Greene, nothing like this 
occurred. From the vigilance and activity of his light 
troops, he was never three hours, at a time, without 
correct information of the position of his foe. 

To give rest to his fatigued and harassed troops, 
and renovate their strength, against the day of ac- 
tion, to which he felt confident that his adversary, as 
well as himself was steadfastly looking, as soon as 
his forces should be sufficiently augmented, lord 



LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 223 

Cornwallis took post, with his army, at BelPs Mill, 
on the waters of Deep river. 

For the same purposes, and to wait for reinforce- 
ments, which he knew must shortly arrive, general 
Greene fixed his head-quarters, at the Troublesome 
iron-works. In selecting this position, he manifested 
his usual discernment and skill. It enabled him to 
maintain his communication with Virginia, the chief 
source of his hopes and expectations, as to troops, 
provisions, and military stores. 

It was now, that in the consummate abilities of 
the American leader, lord Cornwallis began to per- 
ceive his own ultimate and unavoidable discomfiture, 
unless prevented by some stroke of fortune. 

In the last struggle for superiority, he had lost a 
double prize. He had failed to bring his adversary to 
action, while his force was inferior; and he- had re- 
ceived no accession to his own army, from the roy- 
alists of the country. For, until the British arms 
should attain a decided ascendency, those deluded ci- 
tizens had prudently determined to remain at their 
homes. So salutary, in its effects, was the overthrow 
of colonel Pyle; an event, which, in his sound judg- 
ment, general Greene estimated more highly, than 
he would have done the discomfiture of an equal 
number of British troops. 



224, LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE, . 

- 

At lengthy to the unspeakable joy of Greene, 
arrived his expected reinforcements, with supplies 
of provisions and military stores. 

Having spent a few days, in the further discipline 
and amalgamation of his army, by the intermingling 
of fresh with veteran soldiers, it was, now, determin- 
ed, by him, no longer to decline a meeting with the 
enemy, but to seek battle, if it should not be offered. 

A similar disposition prevailing, on both sides, a 
trial in arms could not be remote. It occurred, at 
Guilford court-house, on the fifteenth of the month; 
and was one of the most obstinate, sanguinary, and 
splendid affairs, that marked the course of the revo- 
lutionary war. 

The policy of Greene, in now, encountering his 
foe, was no less masterly, than it had been before, in 
perseveringly avoiding him. 

From the comparative strength of the two armies, 
he was confident, that, although he might be forced 
from the field, he could not experience a very seri- 
ous disaster. He must, necessarily, in the action, 
cripple and reduce the British force, which, in the 
present posture of affairs, could not be recruited; while 
any loss he might sustain, could be easily remedied, 
by further reinforcements. His condition, therefore, 
after battle, must be relatively amended. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 225 

Such was the reasoning of general Greene; and, 
its correctness was demonstrated by the effects of 
the battle, which shortly ensued. It was his inter- 
est, therefore, to engage, as soon as he could do it 
on favourable terms. 

Nor was a trial of strength less the wish of the 
opposite party. 

Diminished, by the casualties incident to a state 
of war, far beyond its accession of fresh troops, it 
was obvious, that the British army was destined to 
ruin, unless saved by a removal of the cause, to which 
this was attributable. That cause was the presence 
and operations of the army of Greene. 

To destroy the influence of this army, by com- 
pelling a retreat, lord Cornwallis had found to be 
impracticable. Nothing remained, therefore, but to 
destroy it, by the sword, or to retreat himself. Be- 
sides, the hopes of the friends of freedom were 
strengthened, their energies invigorated, and the 
American forces were increasing in numbers, as well 
as in discipline. Each day's delay, therefore, threw 
a deeper shade over the declining prospects of the 
royal arms. 

Such was the critical situation, to which the po- 
licy of Greene, had reduced his adversary. 

Ff 
Both leaders were now desirous of battle; but from 
different motives. In the latter, this desire arose from 
a wish to avoid ruin, which must, however, more 
certainly and speedily overwhelm him, should he sus- 
tain a defeat. In the former, it was produced, by a 
solicitude to meliorate his condition, which he could 
not fail to do, even although victory should declare 
against him. 

On this battle, lord Cornwallis staked his army, 
and his hopes; while general Greene, staking nothing, 
but the lives of a few of his troops, fought under a 
certainty of gain. The one must conquer or fall; the 
other was sure of being benefited, even by defeat. 

Corresponding to their situations, and the differ- 
ent views and feelings, arising out of them, was the 
conduct of the two leaders, on the field of battle. 

General Greene fought bravely, exposing, to every 
peril, his army, and his own person,* to injure his ad- 

s 

*The exertions of the two rival generals, both in preparing for this ac- 
tion, and, during- the course of it, were never surpassed; and, forgetful of 
every thing, but the fortune of the day, they, on several occasions, min- 
glerJ in the danger, like common soldiers. 

In one instance, Greene was near being cut off, a detachment of the 
enemy having partly gained his rear, within thirty paces of him, while, 
in advance of his troops, he was intent on the direction of an important 
movement. 

Fortunately, major Pendleton, one of his aids, discovering his situa- 
tion, and a *mall copse of woods concealing him from the foe, he regained 
the line, without injury. 



LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 221 

versary, secure victory, if practicable, and, at all 
events, to prevent disaster. But he calmly retreated, 
when it was no longer prudent, to maintain his 
ground. 

Lord Cornwallis, on the contrary, desperate in his 
fortune, and resolutely bent on victory or death, risk* 
ed every thing, firing even among his own troops, to 
repulse his enemy and keep the field. 

General (at that time colonel) Lee, who acted him- 
self a conspicuous part in it, gives the following ac- 
count of the disposition and movements, in this me- 
morable engagement. 

" Guilford court-house, erected near the great state 
road, is situated on the brow of a declivity, which de- 
scends gradually with an undulating slope for about 
a half mile. It terminates in a small vale, intersected 
by a rivulet. On the right of the road is open ground 
with some few copses of wood until you gain the last 
step of the descent, where you see thick glades of 
brushy wood reaching across the rivulet. On the left 
of the road from the court-house, a deep forest of lofty 
trees, which terminates nearly in a line with the ter- 
mination of the field on the opposite side of the road. 
Below this forest is a small piece of open ground, 
which appeared to have been cultivated in corn the 
preceding summer. This small field was long, but 



228 . LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 

narrow, reaching close to the swamp bordering upon 
the rivulet. 

"In the road captain Singleton was posted, in a line 
with the termination of the large field and the com- 
mencement of the small one, with two six pounders 
ivithin close shot of the rivulet, where the enemy, 
keeping the road, would pass Across the road on his 
left, some few yards in his rear, the North Carolina 
militia were ranged under generals Butler and Eaton. 
At some distance behind this line, the Virginia mili- 
tia, led by the generals Stevens and Lawson, were 
formed in a deep wood ; the right flank of Stevens and 
the left flank of Lawson resting on the great road. 
The continental infantry, consisting of four regiments, 
were drawn up in the rear of the Virginia militia, in 
the field to the right of the road; the two regiments 
of Virginia, conducted by colonel Greene and lieute- 
nant colonel Hawes, under the order of brigadier Hu- 
ger, composing the right; and the two of Maryland, 
led by colonel Gunby and lieutenant colonel Ford, un- 
der the orders of colonel Williams, composing the left 
Of these, only the regiment of Gunby was veteran; 
the three others were composed of new soldiers, among 
whom were mingled a few T who had served from the 
beginning of the war; but all the officers were experi- 
enced and approved, Greene, well informed of his ene- 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 229 

my's inferiority in number, knew he could present but 
one line, and had no reserve; considering it injudicious 
to weaken either of his lines by forming one. On the 
right, lieutenant colonel Washington, with his cavalry, 
the old Delaware company under the brave captain 
Kirkwood, and colonel Lynch with a battalion of the 
Virginia militia, was posted, with orders to hold safe 
that flank. For the same purpose, and with the same 
orders, lieutenant colonel Lee was stationed on the 
left flank with his legion and the Virginia riflemen 
commanded by colonel Clarke. 

" In the rear line our small park was placed, with 
the exception of two sixes with captain Singleton, — - 
who was now with the front line, but directed to re- 
pair to the rear as soon as the enemy should enter 
into close battle, and there take his assigned station. 

" As soon as the British van appeared, Singleton 
opened a cannonade upon it, — convincing lord Corn- 
wallis of his proximity to the American army. Lieu- 
tenant M^Cleod, commanding the royal artillery, has- 
tened up with two pieces, and, stationing himself in 
the road near the rivulet, returned our fire. Thus 
the action commenced: the British general in the 
mean time arranging his army in order of battle. Al- 
though he could form but one full line, he took the 
resolution of attacking an able general advantage- 



£S0 LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 

ously posted, with a force more than double, a por- 
tion whereof he knew to be excellent, supported by 
a cavalry of the first character. Yet such was his 
condition, that lord Cornwallis was highly gratified 
with having it in his power, even on such terms, to 
appeal to the sword. The seventy-first, with the re- 
giment of Bose, formed his right under the order of 
major general Leslie; his left was composed of the 
twenty-third and thirty-third regiments, led by lieu- 
tenant colonel Webster. 

"The royal artillery directed by lieutenant M'Cleod 
and supported by the light infantry, of the guards 
and the yagers, moved along the road in the centre. 
The first battalion of guards, under lieutenant colonel 
Norton, gave support to the right. While brigadier 
O'Hara, with the grenadiers and second battalion of 
guards, maintained the left, lieutenant colonel Tarle- 
ton, with the cavalry in column, formed the reserve 
on the road, in the rear of the artillery. 

" The moment the head of the British column pas- 
sed the rivulet, the different corps, in quick step, de- 
ployed to the right and left, and soon were ranged in 
line of battle. 

"Leslie instantly advanced upon the North Caroli- 
na militia. These troops were most advantageously 
posted under cover of a rail fence, along the margin 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 231 

i 

©f the woods; and Campbell's riflemen and the legion 
infantry connected in line with the North Carolina 
militia, turning with the fence as it approached the 
rivulet, raked by their fire the right of the British 
wing, entirely uncovered: — the legion cavalry, in the 
woods, in a column pointing to the angular corner 
of the fence ready to support the militia on its right, 
or the infantry of the legion to its left. The appear- 
ance in this quarter was so favourable, that sanguine 
hopes were entertained by many of the officers, from 
the manifest advantage possessed, of breaking down 
the enemy's right before he approached the fence; 
and the troops exhibited great zeal and alacrity. 

"Lieutenant colonel Webster took his part with his 
usual ability, — moving upon the Virginia militia, who 
w T ere not so advantageously posted as their comrades 
of North Carolina, yet gave every indication of main- 
taining their ground with obstinacy. Stevens, to give 
efficacy to this temper, and stung with the recollection 
of their inglorious flight in the battle of Camden, had 
placed a line of sentinels in his rear with orders to 
shoot every man that flinched. When the enemy came 
within long shot, the American line, by order, began 
to fire. Undismayed, the British continued to advance; 
and having reached a proper distance, discharged 
their pieces and rent the air with shouts. To our infinite 
distress and mortification, the North Carolina militia 
took to flight, a few only of Eaton's brigade excepted, 
who clung to the militia under Clarke; which, with 
the legion, manfully maintained their ground. Every 
effort was made by the generals Butler and Eaton P 
assisted by colonel Davie, commissary general, with 
many of the officers of every grade, to stop this unac- 
countable panic; for not a man of the corps had been 
killed, or even wounded Lieutenant colonel Lee 
joined in the attempt to rally the fugitives, threatening 
to fall upon them with his cavalry. All was vain, — so 
thoroughly confounded were these unhappy men, that 
throwing away arms, knapsacks, and even canteens, 
they rushed like a torrent headlong through the woods. 
In the mean time the British right became so injur- 
ed by the keen and advantageous contest still upheld 
by Clarke and the legion, as to render it necessary 
for Leslie to order into line his support under lieu- 
tenant colonel Norton, a decided proof of the difficult 
condition to which he must have been soon reduced, 
had the North Carolina militia done their duty. The 
chasm in our order of battle, produced by this base 
desertion, was extremely detrimental in its conse- 
quences; for being seized by Leslie, it threw the 
corps of Lee out of combination with the army, and 
also exposed it to destruction. General Leslie, turn-

ing the regiment of Bose, with the battalion of guards, 
upon Lee, pressed forward himself with the seven- 
ty-first to cover the right of Webster, — now keenly 
engaged with the Virginia militia; and seized the 
most advantageous position, which he preserved 
through the battle. Noble was the stand of the Vir- 
ginia militia; Stevens and Lawson, with their faithful 
brigades, contending for victory against the best of- 
ficer in the British army, at the head of two regi- 
ments, distinguished for intrepidity and discipline; 
and so firmly did they maintain the battle (secured 
on their flank by the position taken by Washington, 
who, anxious to contribute to the aid of his brave 
countrymen, introduced Lynch's battalion of rifle- 
men upon the flank of Webster, already fully enga- 
ged in front) that brigadier Q'Hara, with the grena- 
diers and second battalion of the guards were brought 
into the line in support of Webster. As soon as this 
assistance was felt, lieutenant colonel Webster, turn- 
ing the thirty-third upon Lynch, relieved his flank of 
all annoyance; and instantly O'Hara, advancing with 
the remainder of the left wing with fixed bayonets, 
aided by the seventy-first under Leslie, compelled 
first Lawson's brigade and then Steven's to abandon 
the contest. Unhappily the latter general received a 
ball through his thigh, which accelerated not a little

the retreat of his brigade. The militia no longer pre- 
sented even the show of resistance: nevertheless, 
such had been the resolution with which the corps 
under Lee, sustaining itself on the left against the first 
battalion of guards and the regiment of Bose, and so 
bravely did the Virginia militia support the action on 
the right, that, notwithstanding the injurious deser- 
tion of the first line without exchanging a shot, every 
corps of the British army, excepting the cavalry still 
in reserve, had been necessarily brought into battle, 
and .many of them had suffered severely. It cannot 
be doubted, had the North Carolina militia rivalled 
that of Virginia upon this occasion, that lord Corn- 
wallis must have been defeated: and even now the 
continental troops being in full vigor, and our caval- 
ry unhurt, there was good ground yet to expect vic- 
tory. 

" Persevering in his determination to die or to con- 
quer, the British general did not stop to concentrate 
his force, but pressed forward to break our second 
line. The action, never intermitting on his right, was 
still sternly maintained by colonel Norton's battalion 
of guards and the regiment of Bose with the rifle mi- 
litia and the legion infantry; so that this portion of the 
British force could not be brought to bear upon the 
third line, supported by colonel Washington at the

head of the horse, and Kirkwood's Delaware compa- 
ny. General Greene was well pleased with the pre- 
sent prospect, and flattering himself with a happy con- 
clusion, passed along the line, exhorting his troops 
to give the finishing blow. Webster, hastening over 
the ground occupied by the Virginia militia, sought 
with zeal the continental line, and presently ap- 
proached its right wing. Here was posted the first 
regiment of Maryland, commanded by colonel Gun- 
by, having under him lieutenant colonel Howard. 
The enemy rushed into close fire; but so firmly was 
he received by this body of veterans, supported by 
Hawes' regiment of Virginia and Kirkwood's com- 
pany of Delawares, (being weakened in his contest 
with Steven's brigade, and as yet unsupported, the 
troops to his right not having advanced from inequa- 
lity of ground or other impediments) that with equal 
rapidity he was compelled to recoil from the shock. 
"Recrossing aravine in his rear, Webster occupied 
an advantageous height, waiting for the approach of 
the rest of the line. Very soon lieutenant colonel Stu- 
art, with the first battalion of guards, appeared in the 
open field, followed successively by the remaining 
corps, all anxious to unite in this last effort. Stuart, 
discovering Ford's regiment of Maryland on the left 
of the first regiment, and a small copse of woods con-

cealing Gunby, pushed forward upon Ford, who was 

* 

strengthened by captain Finley with two six poun- 
ders. Colonel Williams, commanding the Maryland 
line, charmed with the late demeanor of the first re- 
giment, hastened towards the second, expecting a 
similar display, and prepared to combine his whole 
force with all practicable celerity; when, unaccount- 
ably, the second regiment gave way, abandoning to 
the enemy the two field pieces. 

" Gunby being left free by Webster's recession, 
wheeled to his left upon Stuart, who was pursuing 
the flying second regiment. Here the action was well 
fought; each corps manfully struggling for victory; 
when lieutenant colonel Washington, who had, upon 
the discomfiture of the Virginia militia, placed him- 
self upon the flank of the continentals, agreeably to 
the order of battle, pressed forward with his cavalry. 

Ci Stuart beginning to give ground, Washington fell 
upon him sword in hand, followed by Howard with 
fixed bayonets, now commanding the regiment in 
consequence of Gunby being dismounted. This 
combined operation was irresistible. Stuart fell by 
the sword of captain Smith, of the first regiment; the 
two field pieces were recovered; his battalion driven 
back with slaughter, — its remains being saved by the 
British artillery, which, to stop the ardent pursuit of 



LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. £37 

Washington and Howard, opened upon friends as 
well as foes; for Cornwallis, seeing the vigorous ad- 
vance of these two officers, determined to arrest 
their progress, though every ball, levelled at them, 
must pass through the flying guards. Checked by this 
cannonade, and discovering one regiment passing 
from the woods on the enemy's right, across the 
road, and another advancing in front, Howard believ- 
ing himself to be out of support, retired, followed by 
Washington. 

" To these two regiments, (which were the seven- 
ty-first, which general Leslie had so judiciously con- 
ducted after the ignominious flight of the North Car- 
olina militia, and the twenty-third, the right of Web- 
ster,) brigadier O'Hara, though grievously wounded 
brought the remnant of the first battalion of guards, 
whom he in person rallied; and, with the grenadiers, 
filled up the interval between the left and right wing. 

" Webster, the moment Stuart appeared in the 
field, putting Ford to flight, recrossed the ravine and 
attacked Hawes' regiment of Virginia, supported by 
Kirkwood's company. The action was renewed in 
this quarter with vigor; the seventy-first and twenty- 
third, connected in their centre by the first battalion 
and grenadier guards, having at the same time mo- 
ved upon Howard. Meanwhile the long impending 
contest upon the enemy's right continued without in- 
termission, each of the combatants getting gradually 
nearer to the flanks of their respective armies, to 
close with which was the desired object of both. At 
length lieutenant colonel Norton, with his battalion 
of guards, believing the regiment of Bose adequate 
to the contest, and close to the great road to which 
he had been constantly inclining, pressed forward to 
join the seventy-first. Relieved from this portion of 
the enemy, lieutenant colonel Lee dispensed with his 
cavalry, heretofore held in the rear to cover retreat 
in case of disaster, ordering it to close with the left 
of the continental line, and there to act until it should 
receive further orders. Upon Bose the rifle and the 
legion infantry now turned with increased animation 
and with confidence of success. Lieutenant colonel 
Buisy, of the regiment of Bose, continued to defend 
himself with obstinacy; but pressed as he was by su- 
perior force, he at length gave ground, and fell back 
into the rear of Norton. Still annoying him with the 
rifle corps under Clarke, Lee hastened with his in- 
fantry, to rejoin his cavalry upon the flank of the 
continentals, the point so long and vainly contended 
for. In his route he found the battalion of guards un- 
der Norton in possession of the height first occupi- 
ed by Lawson's brigade of Virginia militia. With 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. £39 

this corps again the legion infantry renewed action, 
and supported by the van company of the riflemen, 
its rear still waiting upon lieutenant colonel Buisy, 
drove it back upon the regiment of Bose. Every ob- 
stacle now removed, Lee pressed forward, followed 
by Clarke, and joined his horse close by Guildford' 
court-house. 

"Having seen the flight of the second regiment of 
Maryland, preceded by that of the North Carolina 
militia, — the corps of Lee severed from the army, 
and considering it, if not destroyed, at least thrown 
out of the action by LeshVs judicious seizure of the 
interval produced by the panic of the North Caroli- 
na militia, and in all probability not able to regain 
its station in the line, — Greene, immutable in the re- 
solution never to risk annihilation of his force, and 
adverting to his scanty supply of ammunition, deter- 
mined, when he found all his personal efforts, se- 
conded by colonels Williams and Carrington, to rally 
the second regiment of Maryland nugatory, to pro- 
vide for retreat. 

" Never did two generals exert themselves more 
than did these rival leaders upon this occasion. Long 
withheld from each other by the sagacious conduct 
ef Greene, until he acquired sufficient strength to 
risk battle, they seized w 7 ith ardor the opportunity at

i 

length presented of an appeal to the sword. This 
decision was wise in both; and every step taken by 
the one and by the other, as well in preparation for 
battle, as in the battle, demonstrated superior abili- 
ties. 

" Greeners position was masterly, as was the 
ground selected for the combat peculiarly adapted to 
his views and troops. Cprnwallis saw the difficulties 
thrown in his way by the skill of his antagonist, and 
diminished their weight by the disposition of his force 
as far as it was practicable. Having done all that 
was possible to accomplish their purpose, no atten- 
tion was omitted, no peril avoided in the course of 
the action, to produce the desired issue. They expo- 
sed their persons, unconscious of danger, and self- 
devoted to national triumph. Upon one occasion 
Greene was nearly passed by a body of the enemy 
within thirty paces of him, when major Pendleton, 
one of his aids, discovered them. Luckily a copse of 
woods intervened, which covered Greene's return to 
our line. 

" Soon afterwards Cornwallis, seeing the discomfi- 
ture of one battalion of the guards, repaired in per- 
son to direct the measures for the recovery of the 
lost ground; when, by the dauntless exposure of him- 
self, he was placed in extreme danger. It was upon 



LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 241 

this occasion that he ordered his artillery to open 
through his flying guards to stop Washington and 
Howard. Brigadier O'Hara remonstrated, by exclaim- 
ing, that the fire would destroy themselves. " True/' 
replied Cornwallis; "but this is a necessary evil, 
which we must endure to arrest impending destruc- 
tion." 

The numerical force of the two armies, on this 
occasion, was as two to one, the Americans consist- 
ing of four, the British, of two thousand rank and 
file. But, from the superiority, in the discipline and 
equipment of the latter, their real force might be 
considered equal. 

In its effects on the enemy, this battle was mur- 
derous; nearly one third of them including many 
officers of distinction, being killed and wounded. 

Colonel Webster, of the thirty-third (lord Cornwal- 
lis's own regiment), as gallant a soldier, and as ac- 
complished an officer, as ever drew a sword, died of 
his wounds, lamented by the generous of both parties. 

The loss sustained, by the Americans, was much 
less considerable, amounting, in killed and wounded, 
to about four hundred. 

The result of this conflict, although technically a 
defeat, was virtually a victory, on the part of gene- 

ah 
ral Greene. In his relation to his adversary, it pla- 
ced him on higher ground, than he had previously 
occupied; enabling him, immediately afterwards, in- 
stead of the retreating, to become the pursuing 
party. 

That his army was not materially shattered, ei- 
ther in strength or spirit, appeared from his conduct 
soon after the action. 

Not doubting that lord Cornwallis would follow 
him, he retreated slowly and in good order, from 
the field of battle, until attaining, at the distance of 
a few miles, an advantageous position, he again, 
drew up his forces, determined to renew the contest, 
on the arrival of the enemy. 

But his lordship was in no condition to pursue: 
nor, brave and enterprising, as was his character, 
had he the slightest desire for another conflict. Hav- 
ing, by pa.st experience, not to be forgotten, learnt 
that his adversary was an Ulysses in wisdom, he now 
perceived, that he was an Ajax in strength. Alike 
expert in every mode of warfare, and not to be van- 
quished, either by stratagem or force, he found him i 
too formidable to be again approached. 

Influenced by these sentiments, lord Cornwallis 
instead of pursuing his foe, or even maintaining his 
ground, commenced his retreat, leaving behind him 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 243 

about seventy of his wounded, whom he recommend- 
ed, in a letter, written by himself, to the humanity 
and attention of the American chief. 

As a last effort to augment his forces, in that quar- 
ter, by embodying the royalists of the place, he pro- 
claimed, in great pomp of style, the victory he had 
gained, and called on all loyal subjects, to assemble, 
in arms, and repair to his standard, in support of the 
government of their rightful sovereign. 

But it was too late. The film had fallen from the 
eyes of the disaffected, and neither promise nor stra- 
tagem, could any longer delude them. 

The cause of freedom was rising before them, 
with a force that could not be resisted, and a bright- 
ness that nothing could obscure. The American 
chief appeared invincible. Having dissipated, by his 
genius, the clouds of adversity that lately surround- 
ed him, he was now in the midst of them, in all his 
splendour. 

A few weeks since, they had seen him, at the head 
of a handful of troops, consulting his safety, in a ra- 
pid retreat. But, brief had been the triumph of the 
foe that pursued him. Gathering strength, like An- 
taeus from his fall, he had suddenly returned, more 
vigorous and formidable, from the lap of misfortune. 
Although forced from the field, in the late engage-

4 

merit, by adverse occurrences beyond his control, 
his genius had converted defeat into victory. In fact, 
the fortune of war was completely reversed; and the 
British was, now, the retreating party. 

Under such circumstances, for lord Cornwallis to 
expect to fill up his devastated ranks, by the acces- 
sion of tories, might well be denominated, the " hope 
of despair." As most of those individuals had ad- 
hered to the royal interest, only because they con- 
sidered it the strongest, it was not to be looked for, 
that they would risk much in its favour, now that it 
was palpably and rapidly on the decline. 

Had general Greene been in a condition to pursue 
his lordship, as soon as he commenced his retreat, 
the destruction of that officer and his army would 
have been inevitable. Some spot on the plains of 
Carolina would have witnessed the surrender, that 
was reserved for Virginia; and the hero of the south, 
would have worn the laurels, which, shortly after- 
wards, decorated the brow of the hero of the nation. 
But Greene's military stores were so far expend- 
ed, that he could not pursue, until he had received a 
supply. The delay thus occasioned, gave time to 
the British commander, to effect his escape. Colonel 
Lee, who was despatched in pursuit of him, with a 
corps of light troops, hung on his rear and embar- 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 245 

rassed his march; but was too weak to make a se- 
rious impression on him, or, in any considerable de- 
gree, to retard his progress. 

Having received his supplies, Greene immediately 
pursued the enemy, leaving behind him, all the 
wounded of the British army, that had fallen into his 
possession, and such of his own as were unfit to be 
removed. 

The more certainly to secure to these unfortunate 
soldiers, every accommodation and comfort that the 
country could afford, he recommended them to the 
humanity and attention of the inhabitants of New- 
Garden, a large and wealthy settlement in the neigh- 
bourhood, composed almost entirely, of an extensive 
congregation cf the society of Friends. 

In his letter, on this occasion, he observed, that 
he himself had been bred a member of that society, 
and still admired the excellence of their habits, and 
held in high estimation, the principles of piety and 
practical virtue, by which they were governed. 

That he knew well their abhorrence of war, and 
their determination, not to be concerned, in any 
thing connected with the profession of arms. Nor 
did he ask of them a departure from this resolution. 
He only solicited, in behalf of a few unfortunate men, 
who had suffered, in the late action, those kind offices, 



246 LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 

in the performance of which, he was sensible they 
delighted. That, in bestowing these, they could not 
be said to take any part in the existing cqntest, in 
as much as the subjects of them, belonged alike to 
both armies. 

He requested of them, therefore, nothing, but the 
exercise of that general beneficence, which he be- 
lieved to be dictated by their own hearts, no less 
than by the excellent religion they professed. 

In consequence of this warm and benevolent ap- 
peal, the disabled soldiers received from those to 
whom it was addressed, every thing they could do, 
to sooth their sufferings, and heal their wounds. 

The eagerness of Greene's pursuit, and his earn- 
est desire to bring the enemy to battle, are evinced 
by the following letter to colonel Lee. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

Headquarters, 11 o'clock, March 21st, 1781. 

Lieutenant colonel Lee, 

DEAR SIR, 

Your letter dated at New Garden, yesterday, has this moment come to hand. Our army marched 
yesterday, in the direct route for Magee's Ordinary, near the head waters of Rockv river, which will be 
twelve miles from Bell's mills. We expect to get about two or three miles beyond Passley to night. We have got provisions to draw, cartridges to make, and several 
other matters to attend to, which will oblige us to halt a little earlier than common. 

I beg you will try to forward me the best intelli- 
gence you can get of the enemy's situation this morn- 
ing, and whether they move or not. 

I mean to fight the enemy again, and wish you to 
have your legion and riflemen ready for action on 
the shortest notice. If, in the mean time, you can at- 
tempt any thing which promises an advantage, put 
it in execution. Lord Cornwallis must be soundly 
beaten, before he will relinquish his hold. 

I am, dear sir, &c. 
Nathaniel Greene,

ed their advance with great activity, under the super- 
intendence of general Koschiusko, who had been 
bred to arms, and regularly educated in the engi- 
neer-department. 

Lord Rawdon, in the mean time, lay inactive in 
Charleston, deeply mortified by the fall of Augusta. 
He was also painfully anxious for the fate of Nine- 
ty-six ; but, was too much crippled, in the battle near 
Camden, to attempt its relief, until he should receive 
reinforcements that were expected from England. 

By the garrison and the assailants, the approaches 
and defence were conducted with eminent ability and 
enterprise. 

a The besiegers," says general Lee, " advancing 
closer and closer, with caution and safety, both on 
the right and left, lieutenant colonel Cruger foresaw 
his inevitable destruction, unless averted by the ap- 
proach of lord Rawdon. To give time for the desir- 
ed event, he determined, by nocturnal sallies, to at- 
tempt to carry our trenches; and to destroy with the 
spade whatever he might gain by the bayonet. These 
rencontres were fierce and frequent, directed some- 
times upon one quarter and sometimes upon another; 
but so judicious had been the arrangements of the 
American general to counteract these expected at- 
tempts, that in no one instance did the British corn*- 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 285 

niandant succeed. The mode adopted was neverthe- 
less pursued without intermission; and although fail- 
ing to effect the chief object contemplated, became 
extremely harassing to the American army, — whose 
repose during the night was incessantly disturbed, 
and whose labour during the day was as incessantly 
pressed. Ignorant of the situation and prospects of 
the British general as lieutenant colonel Cruger con- 
tinued to be, he nevertheless indulged the confidence, 
that every effort would be made for his relief, and 
persevered with firmness and vigour in his defence." 

Lord Rawdon^s long-looked-for reinforcements ar- 
riving on the third of June, his lordship prepared im- 
mediately for the field; and, on the 7th, at the head 
of two thousand troops, advanced from Charleston, 
for the relief of Ninety-six. 

" All his endeavours to transmit information to 
Cruger having failed, his lordship apprehended, that, 
pressed by the difficulties to which that officer must 
be reduced, and despairing of succour, he might be 
induced to surrender, with a view to obtain favour- 
able conditions for his garrison; to stop which, he re- 
newed his efforts to advise him of the propitious 
change of his condition, and his consequent advance 
for his relief. 



£86 LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 

" Greene was informed by Sumpter, on the 11th, 
of the arrival from Ireland, and of the measures im- 
mediately taken by Rawdon to resume offensive ope- 
rations. Directing Sumpter to keep in his lordship's 
front, he reinforced him with all his cavalry conduct- 
ed by lieutenant colonel Washington; urging the bri- 
gadier to exert every means in his power to delay the 
advance of the British army. Marion was also order- 
ed to hasten from the lower country, as soon as he 
should discover the intention of Rawdon to move up- 
on Greene; and brigadier Pickens, just joined from 
Augusta, was detached to Sumpter. 

" Our approaches continued to be pushed with un- 
abated diligence, in the expectation and hope that 
they might be brought to maturity in time to enforce 
the submission of the garrison, before the British ge- 
neral could make good his long march. 

Ci We now began to deplore the early inattention of 
the chief engineer to the enemy's left; persuaded that 
had he been deprived of the use of the rivulet in the 
beginning of the siege, he must have been forced to 
surrender before the present hour. It was deemed 
practicable to set fire to the stockade fort, and thus 
to remove the water defence to the left of the rivulet. 
In the succeeding day, a dark violent storm came on 
from the west, without rain. Lieutenant colonel Lee 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 287 

proposed to general Greene to permit him to make 
the attempt. This being granted, a sergeant with nine 
privates of the legion infantry, furnished with com- 
bustible matter, was directed to approach the stoc- 
kade in the most concealed direction, under cover of 
the storm, while the batteries in every quarter opened 
upon the enemy, and demonstrations of striking at the 
star redoubt were made, with the expectation of di- 
verting his attention from the intrepid party, which, 
with alacrity, undertook the hazardous enterprise. 
The sergeant conducted his gallant band in the best 
manner; concealing it whenever the ground permit- 
ted, and when exposed to view moving along upon 
the belly. At length he reached the ditch with three 
others; the whole close behind. Here unluckily he 
was discovered, while in the act of applying his fire. 
Himself and five were killed; the remaining four es- 
caped unhurt, although many muskets were discharg- 
ed at them running through the field, before they got 
bevond the nearest rise of ground which could cover 
them from danger. After this disappointment, nothing 
remained but to force our works to maturity, and to 
retard the advance of the British army. In the eve- 
ning, a countryman was seen riding along our lines 
south of the town, conversing familiarly with the of- 
ficers and soldiers on duty. He was not regarded, a? 
from the beginning of the siege, our friends in the 
country were in the habit of visiting camp, and were 
permitted to go wherever their curiosity led them, 
one of whom this man was presumed to be. At 
length he reached the great road leading directly to 
the town, in which quarter were only some batteries 
thrown up for the protection of the guards. Putting 
spur to his horse, he rushed with full speed into town, 
receiving the ineffectual fire of our centinels and 
guards nearest to him, and holding up a letter in his 
hand as soon as he cleared himself of our fire. The 
propitious signal gave joy to the garrison, who running 
to meet their friend, opened the gate, welcoming his 
arrival with loud expressions of joy. He was the 
bearer of a despatch from lord Rawdon to Cruger, 
communicating his arrival at Orangeburg in adequate 
force, and informing him that he was hastening to 
his relief. This intelligence infused new vigour into 
the intrepid leader and his brave companions. 

" It also inspired the indefatigable besieger with 
additional motives to push to conclusion his prepar- 
atives, as he now yielded up every hope heretofore 
derived from Cruger^s ignorance of the movement of 
the British general, and the forwardness of our works. 
Major Greene, who commanded the star with great 
ability, finding that our third parallel was nearly

finished, and that a Mayham tower was erecting 
which would overlook his parapet, very judiciously co- 
vered it with sand-bags, to lessen the capacity deriv- 
ed from superior height, leaving between each bag an 
aperture for the use of his riflemen. Nor were the ap- 
proaches on the left less forward than those on the 
right; they not only were directed against the stock- 
ade, but also were carried so near the rivulet, as to 
render supplies of water difficult and precarious. The 
fire during the 17th was so effectual, as to induce the 
enemy to withdraw his guards established between the 
rivulet and the stockade; and parties of the troops on 
the left were posted in various points, to annoy the 
communication with the rivulet. These arrangements 
succeeded throughout the day completely, and the 
enemy suffered greatly from this privation, though 
accomplished too late to produce material advantage. 
Rawdon continued to advance by forced marches, and 
inclining to his right, made a vigorous push to throw 
himself between Sumpter and Greene. 

" In this effort he completely succeeded, and thus 
baffled all the measures adopted by Greene to delay 
his approach. It became now necessary to hazard 
assault of the fort, to meet Rawdon, or to retire. 
The American general was disposed to imitate Caesar 

at Alisia; first to beat the relieving army, and then to

take the besieged town. But his regular force did but 

little exceed the half of that under Rawdon, which 

added to his militia, consisting of the corps of Sump- 

ter, Marion and Pickens, still left him numerically 

inferior to the British general. Nevertheless confiding 

in his known superiority of cavalry, he would have 

given battle to his lordship, could he have left an 

adequate corps to attend to the garrison. Compelled 

to relinquish this plan, he determined to storm the 

fort, although his works were yet unfinished. On the 

right, our third parallel was completed, two trenches 

and a mine were nearly let into the enemy^s ditch, 

and the Mayham tower was finished. 

cc On the left, our trenches were within twenty 
yards of his ditch; and the battery directed by lieu- 
tenant Finn, gave to the assailant, in this quarter, ad- 
vantages which, well supported, ensured success. 
Greene, anxiously as he desired to conclude his se- 
vere toils in triumph, was averse to the unequal con- 
test to which he must necessarily expose his faithful 
troops, and would probably have decided on the safe 
course, had not his soldiers, with one voice, intreated 
to be led against the fort. The American army hav- 



ing witnessed the unconquerable spirit which actuated 
their general, as well as the unexpected results of 
former battles, could not brook the idea of abandon-

i 

ing the siege, without one bold attempt to force a sur 
render. They recollected, with pain and remorse, 
that by the misbehaviour of one regiment at the bat- 
tle of Guilford, and of another at Hobkick's hill, their 
beloved general had been deprived of his merited 
laurels; and they supplicated their officers to entreat 
their commander to give them now an opportunity of 
obliterating preceding disgrace. This generous ardor 
could not be resisted by Greene. Orders were issued 
to prepare for a storm; and the hour of twelve on the 
next day (18th June) was appointed for the assail- 
ing columns to advance by signal from the centre bat- 

terv. 

" Lieutenant colonel Campbell, of the first Virginia 
regiment, with a detachment from the Maryland and 
Virginia brigades, was charged with the attack on 
the left; and lieutenant colonel Lee, with the legion 
infantry and Kirkwood's Delawares, with that on the 
right. Lieutenants Duval of Maryland, and Seldon 
of Virginia, commanded the forlorn hope of Camp-* 
bell; and captain Rudolph^ of the legion, that of Lee. 
Fascines were prepared to fill up the enemy's ditch, 
long poles with iron hooks were furnished to pull 
down the sand bags, with every other thing requisite to 
facilitate the progress of the assailant. At eleven the 
third parallel was manned, and our sharp shooters 
took their station in the tower. The first signal was 
announced from the centre battery, upon which the as- 
sailing columns entered the trenches; manifesting de- 
light in the expectation of carrying by their courage 
the great prize in view. 

" At the second cannon, which was discharged at 
the hour of twelve, Campbell and Lee rushed to the 
assault. Cruger, always prepared, received them with 
his accustomed firmness. The parapets were manned 
with spike and bayonet, and the riflemen, fixed at the 
sand-bag apertures, maintained a steady and destruc- 
tive fire. Duval and Seldon entered the enemy's ditch 
at different points, and Campbell stood prepared to 
support them, in the rear of the party furnished with 
hooks to pull down the sand-bags. This party had 
also entered the enemy's ditch, and began to apply 
the hook. Uncovering the parapet now would have 
given us victory; and such was the vigorous support 
afforded by the musketry from the third parallel, from 
Hie riflemen in the tower, and from the artillery 
mounted in battery, that sanguine expectations of this 
happy issue were universally indulged. The moment 
the bags in front were pulled down, Campbell would 
have mounted the parapet, where the struggle could 
not have been long maintained. Cruger had prepared 
an intermediate battery with his three pieces, which 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. £9S 

lie occasionally applied to right and left. At first it 
was directed against Lee's left, but very soon every 
piece was, applied upon Campbell's right, which was 
very injurious to his column. 

" Major Greene, commanding in the star redoubt^ 
sensible of the danger to which he was exposed, if the 
attempted lodgment upon his front curtain succeeded, 
determined to try the bayonet in his ditch as well as 
on his parapet. To captains Campbell and French was 
committed this bold effort. Entering; into the ditch 
through a sally-port in the rear of the star, they took 
opposite directions, and soon came in contact, the one 
with Duval, the other with Seldom Here ensued a 
desperate conflict. The Americans, not only fighting 
with the enemy in front but with the enemy overhead., 
sustained gallantly the unequal contest, until Duval 
and Seldon became disabled by wounds, when they 
yielded, and were driven back with great loss to the 
point of entry. The few surviving escaped with the 
hookmen to our trenches, where yet remained Camp- 
bell, the sand-bags not being removed. On the left, 
the issue was very different. Rudolph gained the ene- 
my's ditch, and followed by the column, soon opened 
his way into the fort, from which the enemy, giving 
their last fire, precipitately retreated. Measures were 
in train on the part of Lee, to follow up his blow by 



2 


passing the rivulet, entering the town, and forcing the 
fortified prison, whence the left might have yielded 
substantial aid to the attack upon the star, by com- 
pelling Cruger to struggle for the town, or forcing 
him with all his troops to take refuge in the star; a 
situation not long to be held, crowded as he must 
have been, and destitute of water. The adverse for- 
tune experienced in the assault on the right, made 
the mind of Greene return to his cardinal policy, the 
preservation of adequate force to keep the field. 

" Charmed with the courage displayed in his view, 
and regretting its disadvantageous application, he sent 
orders to Campbell to draw off, and to Lee to desist 
from further advance, but to hold the stockade aban- 
doned by the enemy. 

" Our loss amounted, during the siege, to one hun- 
dred and eighty-five killed and wounded; that of the 
garrison to eighty-five. Captain Armstrong, of the 
Maryland line, was the only officer killed on our side 5 
as was lieutenant Roney the only one on their side. 
After our repulse, Greene sent a flag to lieutenant co- 
lonel Cruger, proposing a cessation of hostilities for 
the purpose of burying the dead; but as to the burial 
of the dead the proposition was rejected, Cruger not 
choosing to admit our participation in a ceremonial 
which custom had appropriated to the victor. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 295 

|€ As soon as it was dark, the detachment was with- 
drawn from the stockade, and preparations were be- 
gun for retreat." 

The mortification experienced by the American 
army, in consequence of their repulse from the Bri- 
tish works, and, at being compelled, by the approach 
of an enemy too powerful to be resisted, to abandon 
an enterprise, which, in two days more, must have 
clothed them in laurels, was galling and deep. They 
felt humbled at their failure, although perfectly con- 
scious, that, in the late assault, they had done their 
duty. 

To remove these sensations, so afflicting to the 
brave, and, at the same time, so injurious to military 
service, their humane and heroic commander, who, 
instead of being dissatisfied, was proud of their prow- 
ess, addressed them, in general orders, in a style that 
was kind, consolitary, and encouraging. 

He expressed to them his high and grateful sense 
of their conduct, both in their attack on the fort, and 
during the siege. He assured them, that, judging 
from the past, he anticipated, in future, the most bril- 
liant result, whenever an opportunity should be afford- 
ed them, of confronting the enemy, on equal terms. 
And, that, confiding in their determination, to mani- 
fest, on all occasions, the same dauntless spirit they 



296 LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 

had so recently exhibited, he would neglect, on his 
part, no practicable measure, to gratify them with the 
meeting they so ardently desired, and which he felt 
convinced., was alone necessary to give them victory, 
and cover them with glory. 

On the approach of lord Rawdon, Greene, placing 
his sick and wounded in front, and throwing, as on a 
former occasion, his light troops into the rear, to harass 
his lordship^s van, and retard his advance, fell back 
rapidly on the state of North Carolina. The tract of 
country over which he passed, was exceedingly un- 
favourable for a retreating army, pursued by an expe- 
rienced and powerful foe. It was intersected by four 
considerable streams, the Saluda, the Enoree, the 
Tiger, and Broad river; all of which, lying in his 
front, he was compelled to cross, in the face of the 
enemy. 

His situation was, again, extremely critical, and 
his prospects darkened by a gathering cloud, which 
no mortal eye could penetrate. 

Disheartened, by a state of things, so perilous and 
gloomy, some of his friends, advised him to abandon 
South Carolina, and repair, for safety, to his re- 
sources in the north. His reply was indicative of the. 
patriot and hero. " I will recover the country, or pe* 
rish in the attempt/ 1 



LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE, 291 

Having, without loss, made good his passage over 
the rivers in his front, lord Rawdon, perceiving the 
futility of any further attempt to overtake him, aban- 
doned the pursuit; and, returning to Ninety-six, pre- 
pared for its evacuation. Thus did the policy of 
Greene, which is moral strength, compel the surren- 
der of that fortress, although from a want of physical 
strength, he failed to carry it by the sword. 

To sustain the spirit and hopes of his friends, and 
repress, as far as possible, those of the tories, he re- 
solved not to abandon the tract of country he now oc- 
cupied. No sooner, therefore, had lord Rawdon com- 
menced his retrograde movement towards Ninety-six, 
than general Greene changed his front, and moved in 
the same direction. Nor did he deem it requisite to 
maintain from the enemy a very respectful distance. 
So enterprising was he in his disposition, and so dar- 
ing in his demeanour, that his light troops, which 
now formed his van, hung at times on the British 
rear, intercepting its stragglers and threatening its 
safety. 

On the breaking up of the garrison of Ninety-six, 

and the return of lord Rawdon towards Charleston, 

which immediately ensued, the British army moved in 

two columns, at a considerable distance from each 

other. It was then that general Greene became, in 

pp 
reality, the pursuing party, exceedingly anxious to 
bring his lordship to battle. 

To effect this, colonel Lee, with a detachment of 
light troops, received orders to throw himself in the 
enemy^s front, and, by every practicable measure, 
retard his advance, until Greene should overtake him. 

This service was performed, with great enterprise, 
ability and skill. But notwithstanding the exertions 
of that distinguished young officer, he was frustrated 
in his purpose, through a failure of the expected co- 
operation of others. Thus, by one of those accidents, 
which so often decide the fate of armies, did that of 
lord Rawdon escape destruction. For had Sumpter, 
Marion, and Washington, been fortunate enough to 
join Lee, at either of the places designated in their 
plan, his lordship would have been retarded until 
Greene had reached him; in which case, his ruin 
would have been inevitable! 

Near half the summer was already wasted. Since 
the commencement of January, the army of Greene 
had experienced nothing but an uninterrupted series 
of exertion, toil, exposure, and battle. It is believed 
that a more active, or, for the number of troops engag- 
ed, a more eventful campaign, is nowhere recorded 
in military history. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 299 

m 

Nor had adverse fortune been backward in her ap- 
proaches, or light in her visitations. The Americans 
had been twice defeated in general action; once re- 
pulsed from the lines of a fortress; and twice com- 
pelled to consult their safety, in a rapid, arduous, and 
extensive retreat. Notwithstanding this, their hopes 
were sanguine, and thejr confidence unshaken; be- 
cause the genius of their commander still convert- 
ing misfortune into prosperity, and, deriving from de- 
feat the advantages of victory, was conducting them 
with certainty to conquest and triumph. Already had 
they captured most of the enemy's posts, turned 
against him the tide of war, so as to place him com- 
pletely on the defensive, and wrested from his hand 
a large proportion of the conquered territory. 

But the season was now hot, and the troops were 
becoming sickly. General Greene, therefore, resolv- 
ed on retiring to a secure and healthy position, to in- 
dulge his army in a short repose, that their health 
being restored, and their strength renovated, they 
might be the better prepared to act with vigour, in 
their future operations. 

Selecting for this purpose the high hills of San- 
tee, where the air is pure, the water excellent, and, 
in consequence of the elevation of the ground, the 






300 LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 

heats less oppressive, he encamped there about the 
middle of July. 

This pause from the toil of active operations, the 
first they had enjoyed for many months, was alike 
necessary and acceptable to officers and soldiers. To 
the commander himself it was peculiarly so, as it af- 
forded him leisure to scrutinize his own conduct, to 
derive instructive lessons from a calm review of it, 
and to mature more fully, by profound meditation, the 
scheme of warfare he was afterwards to pursue. 



CHAPTER IX. 

Greene is satisfied with his army — his gigantic plan of operations, for the 
entire recovery of the southern department — -in consequence of infor- 
mation from general Washington, he relinquishes a part of it.— The 
execution of colonel Hayne, with Greene's conduct on the occasion — 
the salutary effects of that conduct — colonel Hayne's letter — his de- 
portment at the place of execution, compared with that of major An- 
dre — all things considered, the preference given to the conduct of the 
American — Greene marches in quest of the enemy — advances on 
them, at the Eutaw springs — the battle of that place — description of 
■ — a singular and interesting military adventure. — The British army 
retreats, and the American pursues — the shattered and enfeebled con- 
dition of the former — Greene's relative condition meliorated, by every 
operation in which he engages — this an evidence of the superiority of 
his genius. Unable to compel the foe to another action, he falls back, 
by easy marches, to the high hills of Santee. 

From a deliberate retrospect of what he had al- 
ready achieved, Greene found abundant reason to 
be satisfied with his army. While the loyalty of 
its attachment to his own person, and to the glo- 
rious cause in which he was engaged, conciliated 
his affection and awakened his gratitude, the invin- 
cibility of its spirit, and its heroism in action, exci- 
ted his admiration, and ministered to his pride. 

But notwithstanding the discipline and firmness 
of his regulars, and the high moral excellence of all 
his troops, their numbers were too limited, and their 
physical powers too inconsiderable, to execute the 



302 LIFE OF GENERAL &REENE. 

daring and gigantic plan he meditated for the recove- 
ry of the southern department. 

Virginia, although valiantly struggling in defence 
of her freedom, was ready to sink under a formida- 
ble invasion. Wilmington in North Carolina was ac- 
tually occupied by a British garrison, and, no oppo- 
sition to them being there made, the whole eastern 
section of that state, was virtually subject to the do- 
minion of the enemy. For the recovery of the states of 
South Carolina and Georgia much had been done; 
but still, their capitals and a small portion of their 
maritime districts, were in possession of the invaders. 

The whole amount of the southern army now as- 
sembled on the high hills of Santee, did not exceed 
two thousand three hundred. 

With a force thus disproportioned, an attempt to 
act on a theatre of war so extensive in its limits, 
would have presented itself to most leaders as wild 
and chimerical. But to the mind of Greene, capa- 
cious, enlightened, and full of resources, the pro- 
ject appeared feasible; and his love of enterprise de- 
termined him to undertake it. 

His plan appears to have been, to commence his 
operations, by the reduction of the garrison in Wil- 
mington; then expel the enemy from South Carolina 
and Georgia; and, having accomplished this, hasten 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. SOS 

with the elite of his army, and, placing himself at 
the head of the troops in Virginia, again take the field 
against lord Corn wallis, who had assumed the com- 
mand of the British forces in that state — a scheme 
of action, and a combination of adventure, beyond, 
perhaps, what any other leader ever meditated with 
such limited means. 

Some movements towards the execution of this 
plan having been already effected, Greene, in con- 
sequence of information received from general Wash- 
ington, was induced to relinquish it, and confine his 
views, for the present, exclusively to the recovery of 
the two southern states. 

That he would have succeeded in his colossal at- 
tempt against the enemy, throughout the whole of the 
southern department, it would be hazardous either 
to assert or deny. The conception of the enterprise 
marks, at least, the compass of his mind, and the 
boldness of his spirit; and satisfactorily demonstrates 
the stupendous results, that might have been ex- 
pected from his operations, had his force been com- 
mensurate with his talents for war. Nor is it ex- 

in 

travagant to believe, that, in the prosecution of his 
design, comparatively feeble as his army was, he 
would have created and called into action, resources 
sufficient for its complete accomplishment. 



304< LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 

About this period, occurred, in Charleston, a very 
tragical event, which, although private in itself, in- 
volved public principles, of great latitude and import- 
ance, and called for the interference of general 
Greene, as commander of the American forces in 
that quarter. JNor was he wanting, on the occasion, 
either in sympathy as a man, or in prompt investi- 
gation and decision as an officer. 

The event alluded to, was the inhuman execution, 
I by the British commandant, of colonel Hayne, an 
American citizen of high respectability and worth, 
in direct violation of a compact entered into with 
himself, and contrary to the principles of legitimate 
war. 

The object of the enemy, in the perpetration of 
this nefarious act, was perfectly manifest. If it was 
not openly avowed, no pretexts at least were feign- 
ed, for the purpose of concealment. Nor could any 
attempt at disguise have proved effectual. It was, 
to intimidate the friends of Independence in the 
neighbourhood of Charleston, and prevent them, on 
the approach of the American forces, from resort- 
ing to arms, and assembling around the standard of 
their country. 

But the wisdom and firmness of Greene frustrat- 
ed their intention, and greatly promoted the very end 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 305 

they were solicitous to prevent. Thus did he now, 
as on every other occasion, by an open, manly, and 
magnanimous line of conduct, defeat them in their 
measures of short sighted policy. More conclusive evi- 
dence of his intellectual superiority cannot be required. 

No sooner was he informed of the circumstances 
of colonel Hayne's execution, than he addressed a 
letter to colonel Balfour, the British commandant 
of Charleston, demanding an explanation of so dar- 
ing an outrage on the laws of war, and the recog- 
nized rights of the American citizen. 

The attempt to explain amounting to nothing but 
a miserable subterfuge, Greene resolved on a stern 
retaliation, should the practice be pursued. In this 
he was supported by all his officers, who concluded 
a spirited and manly address to him, in the follow- 
ing words. 

€c p erm it us to add, that while we lament the ne- 
cessity of such a severe expedient, and commiserate 
the sufferings to which individuals will be necessarily 
exposed, we are not unmindful that such a measure 
may, in its consequences, involve our own lives in 
additional danger. But we had rather forego tenir 
porary distinctions, and commit our lives to the most 
desperate situation, than prosecute this just and ne- 
cessary war on terms so unequal and dishonourable/ 
•» 

Gratified alike by this assurance of cordial sup- 
port, and the firm and animated language in which 
it was proffered, the commander immediately is- 
sued a proclamation, deeply reprobating the late 
execution, and declaring his deliberate and solemn 
determination to " make reprisals for all such in- 
human insults, and to select, for the objects of re- 
taliation, officers of the regular forces, and not the 
deluded Americans, who had joined the royal army." 

By this just and resolute measure, he attained, at 
once, a two-fold end. He broke down the sangui- 
nary disposition of the enemy, and, by convincing 
the citizens of South Carolina, that their rights and 
lives would be securely protected or rigorously 
avenged, he encouraged them to repair to the stand- 
ard of their country. 

Even the British officers themselves, after a cool 
and dispassionate examination of the facts and prin- 
ciples connected with the event, were compelled to 
condemn the injustice and cruelty exercised towards 
colonel Hayne, and to recognize, of course, the cor- 
rectness of the resolution of general Greene. 

The ferocious and exterminating character which 
the war in the South, at this period, threatened to 
put on, was fortunately prevented by two causes — 
the attitude which the American general assumed; 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 307 

and the prospects of peace which soon afterwards 
ensued. Greene did not retaliate; and the British 
commander, ashamed of the past, and shrinking from 
the responsibility of what must necessarily follow, 
should he indulge his thirst for the blood of the in- 
nocent, proceeded no further. 

The following letter, written by colonel Hayne 
when informed, after a mock trial, that he was sen- 
tenced to expire on a gibbet, and the subsequent nar- 
rative by general Lee, deserve to be perused by 
every native of the United States. If the reader's sensi- 
bility be honourable and his heart loyal, those pro- 
ductions will strengthen his love of country, and che- 
rish in his bosom, a laudable pride, by representing to 
him, in colours that nothing can improve, the impos- 
ing character, which, in the most trying situation, an 
American can maintain, and the calm dignity with 
which he can die. 

Those, and they are many, — that have wept over 
the deportment of the unfortunate Andre, who, by 
the maxims of war, deserved his fate, will scarcely 
do less over that of the accomplished and amiable 
Hayne, who, by the same maxims, was entitled to 
an acquittal. 

Indeed with the closing scene of the life of colonel 
Hayne are connected various considerations, which 
give to it, in point of dignity and interest, a decided 
ascendency over that of major Andre. 

The latter gentleman was a soldier by profession, 
adjutant general to the British army, and the intimate 
and confidential friend of the commander in chief 
of the royal forces. 

His habits, therefore, with the whole bent of his 
mind, and the train of his daily reflections, must have 
rendered the idea of death familiar to him, and, uni- 
ted to his military pride, deprived it entirely of its 
power to dismay; while his elevated rank, and the im- 
portant business which had been lately confided to 
him, placed him on an eminence, where all Christen- 
dom must witness his demeanour. Hence his future 
fame, must be in proportion to his present firmness. 

Under such circumstances, to die with calm and 
manly heroism, was a natural, if not a necessary act. 
To have shrunk from the blow, or manifested un sol- 
dierly perturbation under the trial, would have been 
pusillanimous and cowardly. 

Besides, distance and long absence from his friends, 
and his being an unmarried man, lately disappointed 
in a tender attachment, with the well known effect of 
a camp life on the mind of an officer, must have blunt- 
ed greatly those domestic feelings, which give to death 
its severest pang. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 309 

The reverse of this, in all points, was the situation 
of colonel Hayne. 

Although possessing a soul of consummate bravery, 
he was a soldier and an officer only in name. His 
station was that of a private gentleman, and nothing 
more. The pride of rank, therefore, gave him no sup- 
port. In the midst of his friends and neighbours who 
were agonized to distraction by his melancholy fate, 
and fresh from the embraces of his orphan children, 
whose mother he had recently consigned to the tomb, 
he had every thing to crush and humble his spirit, and 
shatter his fortitude at a conjuncture so appalling. » 

To die with greatness, under these circumstances, 
was infinitely difficult — the result of heroism of the 
highest order. Yet, with the firmness of a martyr and 
the humility of a christian, the task was triumphantly 
achieved by the American. 

Without meaning to sully the lustre of major Andre, 
whose character and deportment all must admire, 
we venture to assert, that for one individual, that 
w r ould have shrunk from death in his situation, twen- 
ty would have done it, in that of colonel Hayne. 

That our reasoning on this subject is neither so- 
phistical nor forced, the last words of Andre satis- 
factorily testify. 
\ 

Being told, at the place of execution, that the fatal 
moment was at hand, and asked if he had any thing 
to say, he replied, " Nothing, but to request that you 
will witness to the world, that I die like a brave man" 

In this answer is contained a virtual, but fair 
avowal of the fact, that the very fortitude and lofti- 
ness of soul, which the prisoner exhibited, arose, in 
part, from a firm persuasion, that his heroic deport- 
ment would be made known to the world, and spoken 
of in a way to redound to his fame. 

Equally favourable to the position we have taken, 
are the words of general Washington on the occa- 
sion. 

" Andre," says the general in a private letter, " has 
met his fate with that fortitude, which was to be ex- 
pected, from an accomplished man, and & gallant offi- 
cer" — a sentiment clearly implying, that had he not 
been an officer, less fortitude might in reason have 
been looked for. 

But colonel Hayne did not exhibit less fortitude 
Comparatively, therefore, he exhibited more. 
To lord Rawdon and colonel Balfour, 

C MY LORD AND SIR. 

" On Thursday morning I had the honour of receiv- 
ing a letter from major Frazer, by which he inform- 
ed me, that a council of general officers would be as- 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 31 1 

sembled the next day for my trial; and on the eve- 
ning of the same day, I received another letter from 
the same officer, acquainting me, that instead of that, 
a court of inquiry would sit for the purpose of decid- 
ing under what point of view I ought to be consider- 
ed. I was also told, that any person whom I should 
appoint, would be permitted to accompany me as my 
counsel. Having never entertained any other idea of 
a court of inquiry, or heard of any other being form- 
ed of it, than of its serving merely to precede a coun- 
cil of war, or some other tribunal, for examining the 
circumstances more fully, except in the case of a spy; 
and Mr. Jarvis, lieutenant marhal to the provost, not 
having succeeded in finding the person who had been 
named for my counsel, I did not take the pains to 
summon any witnesses, though it would have been in 
my power to have produced many; and I presented 
myself before the court without any assistance what- 
ever. When I was before that assembly, I was fur- 
ther convinced that I had not been deceived in my 
conjectures. I found that the members of it were not 
sworn, and the witnesses were not examined upon 
oath; and all the members, as well as every person 
present, might easily have perceived, by the questions 
which I asked, and by the whole tenor of my con- 
duct, that I had not the least notion that I was tried 



312 LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 

or examined upon an affair on which my life or death 
depended. 

" In the case of spies, a court of inquiry is all that 
can be necessary, because the simple fact whether 
the person is or is not a spy, is all that can be the ob- 
ject of their researches; and his having entered the 
lines of the enemy's camp or garrison, subjects him 
to military execution. As that accusation neither is 
nor can be made against me, I humbly conceive that 
the information I received, that the court would make 
Inquiry concerning what point of view I ought to be 
considered under, could not be taken as a sufficient 
notice of their having an intention to try me then; but 
could only be thought to signify, that they were to 
take it into consideration whether I ought to be looked 
upon as a British subject or as an American: that 
in the first case I should undergo a legal and impar- 
tial trial; in the second, I should be set at liberty on 
my parole. Judge then, my lord and sir, of the as- 
tonishment I must have been in, when I found they 
had drawn me by surprise into a proceeding tending 
to judgment, without my knowing it to be such; and 
deprived me of the ability of making a legal defence, 
which it would have been very easy for me to have 
done, founded both in law and in fact; — when I saw 
myself destitute of the assistance of counsel and of 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 313 

witnesses; and when they abruptly informed me, that 
after the procedure of the court I was condemned to 
die, and that in a very few days. Immediately upon 
receiving this notice, I sent for the lawyer whom I 
had originally chosen for my counsel. I here inclose 
his opinion concerning the legality of the process held 
against me; and I beg that I may be permitted to re- 
fer myself to him. I can assure you with tlie utmost 
truth, that I had and have many reasons to urge in 
my defence, if you will grant me the favour of a re- 
gular trial, if not, which I cannot however suppose 
from you justice and humanity, I earnestly intreat 
that my execution may be deferred, that I may at 
least take a last farewell of my children, and prepare 
for the dreadful change. I hope you will return me a 
speedy answer, and am, with respect, 

« Isaac Hay^e." 
" To this representation the town major returned 
the following answer. c I have to inform you, that 
your execution is not ordered in consequence of any 
sentence from the court of inquiry; but by virtue of 
the authority with which the commander in chief in 
South Carolina and the commanding officer in 
Charleston are invested: and their resolves on the 
subject are fixed and unchangeable/ 

ar 
" Disdaining further discussion with relentless 
power, Hayne merely solicited a short respite, to en- 
able him for the last time to see his children. The 
request was granted in the following communication 
from the town major. c I am to inform you, that in 
consequence of a petition signed by governor Bull 
and many others, as also of your prayer of yesterday, 
and the humane treatment shown by you to the Bri- 
tish prisoners who fell into your hands, you are re- 
spited for forty-eight hours; but should general 
Greene offer to expostulate in your favour with the 
commanding officer, from that moment this respite 
will cease, and you will be ordered to immediate ex- 
ecution/ 

"After the delivery of this message, the amiable 
American enjoyed the comfort of seeing his family 
and conversing with his friends. During this interest- 
ing, this awful period, he discovered a dignified com- 
posure; and in his last evening declared, that ( he felt 
no more alarmed at death, than at any other occur- 
rence which is necessary and unavoidable/ Very^dif- 
ferent, indeed, were the feelings of his friends. Mrs. 
Peronneau, his sister, accompanied by his children, 
all clad in the deepest mourning, and manifesting the 
toriare of their heart-rending agony, waited on lord 
Rawdon, and on their knees supplicated him to spare

the victim! But his lordship's c resolve was fixed and 
unchangeable!' Anxious to terminate a life of truth 
in the formalities of honour, colonel Hayne solicited, 
in a second letter to the stern duumvirate, permission 
to die like a soldier. He then arranged the preceding 
correspondence; and on the morning of his execution 
presented the packet to his son (a boy of thirteen 
years), and directed him to c deliver it to Mrs. Ed- 
wards, with my request to forward it to her brother 
in congress. Go then to the place of my execution, — • 
receive my body, and see it decently interred with 
my forefathers/ ,This done, he embraced him, im- 
ploring the divine blessing on his orphan children. 
Dressed with his accustomed neatness, accompanied 
by a few friends, he marched with unruffled serenity 
through a weeping crowd to the place of execution. 
He had flattered himself w T ith the presumption that 
his last request would be granted: quickly the sight 
of the gibbet announced the fallacy of this hope. For 
a moment he paused, but immediately recovering his 
wonted firmness, moved forward. At this instant a 
friend whispered his confidence that ' you will now 
exhibit an example of the manner in which an Ame- 
rican can die/ c I will endeavour to do so/ was the re- 
ply of the modest martyr. Never was intention better 
fulfilled: neither arrogating superiority, nor betraying 
weakness, he ascended the cart, unsupported and iu> 
appalled. Having taken leave of his friends, and com- 
mended his infant family to their protection, he drew 
the cap over his eyes, and illustrated by his demeanor, 
that death in the cause of our country, even on a 
gallows, cannot appal the virtuous and the brave. 5J 

Decamping from the high hills of Santee, on the; 
21st of August, general Greene moved in quest of 
the enemy now commanded by colonel Stuart, lord 
Rawdon having recently sailed for Europe. 

Proceeding by easy marches, the better to preserve 
the strength of his troops, and taking a circuitous 
route, that he might pass the Wateree and Congarec, 
two considerable rivers in his front, without molesta- 
tion, he did not arrive in the neigbourhood of the foe. 
posted in force at the Eutaw Springs, until the eve- 
ning of the 7th of September. 

The battle, which, on the following day, was fought 
on that ground, Greene having almost by surprise 
attacked the enemy in their position, was one of the 
most scientific and bloody, that marked the course of 
the revolutionary war. 

General Lee, who took part in it, with his usual 
gallantry and good conduct, has favoured us with the 
following excellent description of it. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 317 

" Greene advanced at four in the morning in two 
columns, with artillery at the head of each, lieutenant 
colonel Lee in his front and lieutenant colonel Wash* 
ington in his rear. 

" While moving with much circumspection, in the 
well grounded expectation that we should fall upon 
the British picquets unperceived, captain Armstrong, 
conducting the reconnoitring party, communicated to 
Lee the approach of a body of the enemy. This oc- 
curred about eight o'clock in the morning, four miles 
from the British camp. Forwarding this intelligence 
to the general, and presuming that the descried foe, 
consisting of horse and foot, must be the van of the 
enemy, Lee halted, waiting for the approximation of 
our main body. 

" The legion infantry were drawn up across the 
road, the cavalry in open wood on its right, and Hen- 
derson with his corps in thick w 7 ood upon its left. 
Shortly the British appeared, following Armstrong, 
The action opened, and the enemy were soon forced 
in front, while the horse, making a rapid movement 
under major Eggleston, gained the rear. The infan- 
try was destroyed, several killed, and about forty 
taken with their captain; the cavalry flying in full 
speed as soon as they saw the legion dragoons pres- 
sing forward, saved themselves, as did the foraging 



318 LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 

party following in the rear, consisting of two or three 
hundred without arms. 

" Pressing forward, we soon got in view of another 
body of the enemy, with whom the action recommenc- 
ed. Lieutenant colonel Lee, advising the general of 
this occurrence, requested the support of artillery to 
counteract that of the enemy now opening. Quickly 
colonel Williams, adjutant general, brought up cap- 
tain Gains with his two pieces in full gallop, who un- 
timbering took his part with decision and effect. 

" During this rencounter both armies formed. The 
American having, as before mentioned, moved in two 
columns, each composed of the corps destined for its 
respective lines, soon ranged in order of battle. 

" The North Carolina militia under colonel Mai- 
medy, with that of South Carolina, led by the briga- 
diers Marion and Pickens, making the first, and the 
continentals making the second line: lieutenant colo- 
nel Campbell with the Virginians on the right; bri- 
gadier Sumner with the North Carolinians in the 
centre; and the Marylanders, conducted by Williams 
and Howard, on the left, resting with its left flank on 
the Charleston road. Lee with his legion was charg- 
ed with the care of the right, as was Henderson with 
his corps with that of the left flank. The artillery, 
consisting only of two threes and two sixes, com- 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 319 

manded by the captains Gains and Finn, were dispos- 
ed the first with the front and the last with the rear 
line; and Baylor's regiment of horse, with Kirkwood's 
infantry of Delaware, composed the reserve, led by 
lieutenant colonel Washington. 

" The British army was drawn up in one line, a few 
hundred paces in front of their camp (tents standing), 
with two separate bodies of infantry and the cavalry 
posted in its rear, ready to be applied as contingencies 
might point out. 

" The Buffs (third regiment) composed its right, 
resting with its flank on the Charleston road; the 
remains of several corps under lieutenant colonel 
Cruger the centre; and the sixty-third and sixty-fourth 
(veterans) the left. On the Eutaw branch, which runs 
to the British camp, right of the Charleston road, was 
posted major Majoribanks at the head of the light 
infantry, inking one battalion, — his right on the 
branch, and his left W etching in an oblique line to- 
wards the flank of the Buffs. This branch issued from 
a deep ravine, between which and the British camp 
was the Charleston road, and between the road and the 
ravine was a strong brick house. The artillery was dis- 
tributed along the line, a part on the Charleston road 
and another part on the road leading to Roache's 
plantation, which passed through the enemy's left wing. 


" The front line of the American army, following 
close in the rear of the two pieces under captain 
Gains, began now to be felt by the van, who, diverg- 
ing to the right and left, firing obliquely, took post 
on the flanks agreeably to the orders of battle. 

" The militia advancing with alacritv, the battle be- 
came warm, convincing lieutenant colonel Stuart, un- 
expected as it appears to have been, that Greene was 
upon him. The fire ran from flank to flank, our line 
still advancing, and the enemy, adhering to his po- 
sition, manifesting a determination not to move. 

" The sixty-third and the legion infantry were warm- 
ly engaged, when the sixty-fourth, with a part of the 
centre, advanced upon colonel Malmedy, who soon 
yielding, the success was pushed by the enemy^s left 5 
and the militia, after a fierce contest, gave way, — leav- 
ing the corps of Henderson and the legion infantry 
engaged, — sullenly falling back, 

" Greene instantly ordered up the centre of the se- 
cond line under brigadier Sumner, to fill the chasm 
produced by the recession of the militia, who came 
handsomely into action, ranging with the infantry of 
the legion and the corps of Henderson, both still 
maintaining the flanks with unyielding energy. The 
battle being reinstated grew hotter, and the enemy, 
who had before gained ground, fell back to his first 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 321 

position. Stuart now brought into line the corps of in- 
fantry posted in the rear of his left wing, and directed 
major Coifiji with his cavalry to take post on his left; 
evincing a jealousy of that flank where the woods 
were open and the ground opportune for cavalry, in 
which we excelled. In this point of the action, lieu- 
tenant colonel Henderson received a ball, which stop- 
ped his further exertion. His corps, however, soon 
recovered from the effect produced by his fall; and, 
led on by lieutenant colonel Hampton, continuing to 
act well its part, the American line persevered in 
advance, and the fire became mutually destructive. 
Greene, determining to strike a conclusive blow, 
brought up the Marylanders and Virginians; when 
. our lile bet ame dense, and pressing forward with 
a shout the battle raged with redoubled fury. 

" The enemy, sensible that the weight of our force 
was bearing upon him, returned our shout, and sus- 
tained himself nobly from right to left. Majoribanks 
now for the first time was put in motion, which being 
perceived, lieutenant eolcnel Washington with the re- 
serve was commanded to &»Jj upon him, and at the 
same moment the line was ordered to hold up its fire 
and to charge with bayonet. The air again resounded 
with the shouts of the advancing Americans; the ene- 
my answering by pouring in a close and quickly re- 

ss 
peated fire. As we drew near, lieutenant colonel Lee, 
at the head of his infantry, discerning that we out- 
stretched the enemy's line, ordered captain Rudolph 
to fall back with his company^ to gain the enemy's 
flank, and to give him a raking fire as soon as he turn- 
ed it. This movement was executed with precision, 
and had the happiest effect. The enemy's left could 
not sustain the approaching shock, assailed in front as 
it was in flank, and it instantly began to give way, 
which quickly afterwards took place along the whole 
line, in some parts of which the hostile ranks contend- 
ed with the bayonet: many individuals of the Mary- 
landers and of the Buffs having been mutually trans- 
fixed. The conquering troops pressed the advan- 
tage they had gained, pursuing the foe, anS? pos- 
sessed themselves of his camp, which was yielded 
without a struggle. Washington promptly advanced 
to execute the orders he had received, and made 
a circuit to gain the rear of Majoribanks, preceded 
by lieutenant Stuart with the leading section. As he 
drew near to the enemy, he found the ground thick- 
ly set with black jack, i;ind almost impervious to 
horse. Deranging as was this unlooked-for obstacle, 
Washington with his dauntless cavalry forced his 
way, notwithstanding the murderous discharge of the 
enemy, safe behind his covert. Human courage could 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 323 

not surmount the obstruction which interposed, or 
this gallant officer with his intrepid corps would have 
triumphed. Captain Watts, second in command, 
fell, pierced with two balls. Lieutenants King and 
Simmons experienced a similar fate; and Washing- 
ton^ horse being killed, he became entangled in the 
fall, when struggling to extricate himself, he was 
bayoneted and taken. Lieutenant Stuart was now 
dismounted, being severely wounded, and his horse 
killed close to the hostile ranks; nor did a single man 
of his section escape, some being killed and the rest 
wounded. The gallant young Carlisle, from Alex- 
andria, a cadet in the regiment, was killed, and half 
the corps d3Stroyed; after which the residue was 
drawn off by captain Parsons, assisted by lieutenant 
Gordon. 

" This repulse took place at the time the British 
line gave way. Majoribanks, although victorious, fell 
back to cover his flying comrades; and major Sheri- 
dan, with the New York volunteers, judiciously took 
possession of the brick house before mentioned for 
the same purpose; wiiii^, with the same view, major 
Coffin, with the cavalry, placed himself on the left, in 
an open field west of the Charleston road. 

" In our pursuit we took three hundred prisoners 
and two pieces of artillery: one taken by captain 
Rudolph, of the legion infantry, and the other by lieu- 
tenant Duval, of the Maryland line, who was killed, 
-—a young officer of the highest promise. As soon 
as we entered the field, Sheridan began to fire from 
the brick house. The left of the legion infantry, led 
by lieutenant Manning, the nearest to the house, fol- 
lowed close upon the enemy still entering it, hoping 
to force his way before the door could be barred. 
One of our soldiers actually got half way in, and for 
some minutes a struggle of strength took place, — 
Manning pressing him in, and Sheridan forcing him 
out. The last prevailed, and the door was closed. 
Here captain Barry, deputy adjutant, general, the 
brother of the celebrated colonel S. Barry, and some 
few others, were overtaken and made prisoners. 
Lieutenant colonel Lee, finding his left discomfited 
in the bold attempt, on the success of which much 
hung, recalled it; and Manning so disposed of his 
prisoners, by mixing them with his own soldiers, as 
to return unhurt; the enemy in the house sparing him 
rather than risking those with him. 

" At this point of time lieutenant colonel Howard^ 
with a part of his regiment, passed through the field 
towards the head of the ravine, and captain Kirk- 
wood appeared approaching the house on its right. 
Majoribanks, though uninjured, continued stationary 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 325 

on the enemy's right, as did Coffin with the cavalry 
on the left. Sheridan, from a few swivels and his 
musketry, poured his fire in every. direction without 
cessation. 

" During this period, Stuart was actively employed 
in forming his line; difficult in itself from the severe 
battle just fought, and rendered more so by the con- 
sternation which evidently prevailed. The followers 
of the army, the wagons, the wounded, the timid, 
were all hastening towards Charleston; some along 
the road in our view; others through the field back of 
the road, equally in view; while the staff were de- 
stroying stores of every kind, especially spirits, which 
the British soldiers sought with avidity. 

" General Greene brought up all his artillery 
against the house, hoping to effect a breach, through 
which he was determined to force his way; convinced 
that the submission of the enemy in the house gave to 
him the hostile army. At the same moment lieuten- 
ant colonel Lee (still on the right) sent for Eggleston 
and his cavalry, for the purpose of striking Coffin, 
and turning the head of the ravine; which point was 
properly selected for the concentration of our force, 
too much scattered by the pursuit, and by the allure- 
ments which the enemy's camp presented. Here we 
commanded the ravine, and might readily break up 



;126 LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 

the incipient arrangements of the rallying enemy; 
here we were safe from the fire of the house, and 
here we possessed the Charleston road. While Lee 
was halted at the edge of the wood, impatiently wait- 
ing for the arrival of his horse, he saw captain Arm- 
strong (the leading officer for the day) approaching, 
and not doubting that the corps was following, the 
lieutenant colonel advanced into the field, directing 
Armstrong to follow. 

" He had gone but a little way, when the captain 
told him that only his section was up, having never 
seen the rest of the corps since its discomfiture on the 
left some time before. This unlooked for intelligence 
was not less fatal to the bright prospect of personal 
glory, than it was to the splendid issue of the conflict. 
Not a single doubt can be entertained, had the caval- 
ry of the legion been in place, as it ought to have 
been, but that Coffin would have been carried, which 
must have been followed by the destruction of the 
British army. Our infantry were getting into order, 
and several small bodies were sufficiently near to 
have improved every advantage obtained by the cav- 
alry. Howard, with Oldham's company, had just re- 
commenced action between the house and the head 
of the ravine; and our troops on the right were in 
motion for the same ground, not doubting the des- 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. %^ k 

truction of Coffin, who only could annoy their flank. 
The recession of Lee, and the retirement of Howard, 
who was at this instant severely wounded, nipped in 
the bud measures of offence in this quarter; while, 
on the left, the house remained in possession of Sher- 
idan, the weight of our metal being too light to effect 
a breach. 

• c This intermission gave Stuart time to restore his 
broken line, which being accomplished, he instantly 
advanced, and the action was renewed. It soon termi- 
nated in the enemy's repossession of his camp, fol- 
lowed by our retreat, with the loss of two field pie- 
ces, and the recovery of one of the two before taken 
by us. 

" Satisfied with these advantages, colonel Stuart 
did not advance farther; and general Greene (after 
despatching lieutenant colonel Lee with a proposition 
to the British commander, the object of which was to 
unite with him in burying the dead), drew off; per- 
suaded that he had recovered the country, the object 
in view, as well as that a more convenient opportuni- 
ty for repetition of battle would be presented on the 
enemy's retreat, which he was convinced could not 
long be deferred. 

" The battle lasted upwards of three hours, and 
was fiercely contested, every corps in both armies 
bravely supporting each other. The loss was uncom- 
monly great, — more than one fifth of the British and 
one fourth of the American army being killed and 
wounded, as stated in the official returns, which in- 
telligent officers of both armies considered short of 
the real loss sustained. The enemy made sixty pris- 
oners, all wounded; — we took about five hundred, in- 
cluding some wounded left in his camp by colonel 
Stuart when he retired. Of six commandants of re- 
giments bearing continental commissions, Williams 
and Lee were only unhurt. Washington, Howard and 
Henderson were wounded; and lieutenant colonel 
Campbell, highly respected, beloved and admired, 
was killed. 

" This excellent officer received a ball in his 
breast, in the decisive charge which broke the British 
line, while listening to an interrogatory from lieuten- 
ant colonel Lee, then on the left of the legion infant- 
ry, adjoining the right of the Virginians, the post of' 
Campbell. He dropped on the pummel of his saddle 
speechless, and was borne in the rear by Lee's or- 
derly dragoon, in whose care he expired, the mo- 
ment he was taken from his horse. Many of our offi- 
cers of every grade suffered, militia as well as conti- 
nentals; among whom was brigadier Pickens, who 
was wounded, 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 329 

" The conclusion of this battle was as unexpected 
to both armies as it was mortifying to ours. The 
splendor which its beginning and progress had shed 
upon our arms became obscured, and the rich prize 
within our grasp was lost. Had our cavalry contribut- 
ed their aid, as heretofore it never failed to do, a 
British army must have surrendered to Greene on 
the field of battle. But they were unfortunately 
brought into action under difficulties not to be con- 
quered; one corps cut to pieces, and the other dis- 
persed, in effect the same; and the critical moment 
passed, before it concentrated. Had the infantry of 
the reserve preceded the cavalry of the reserve, 
Washington would have avoided the unequal contest 
to which he was exposed; and by patiently watching 
for the crisis, would have fallen upon Majoribanks 
when retiring to shield the enemy's broken line. Had 
Eggleston not been drawn from his post by orders 
officiously communicated to that officer as from the 
general, when in truth he never issued such orders, 
Lee would have been joined by his cavalry, ready to 
inflict the last blow, so clearly within his power. Both 
these untoward incidents were necessary to stop us 
from the signal victory courting our acceptance, and 
both occurred, 

Tt 
" The honour of the day was claimed by both sides, 
while the benefits flowing from it were by both yield- 
ed to the Americans: the first belonged to neither and 
the last to us. 

" Congress expressed their sense of the conduct of 
the general and of the merit of the army, presenting 
their thanks to Greene, and to every corps who 
fought under him on that day; presenting him at the 
same time with a British standard, and a gold medal 
emblematical of the battle." 

In this action, the effective force of the two armies 
may be considered equal; each consisting of about 
two thousand three hundred troops, their characters 
being in all respects nearly the same. 

The palm of gallantry and skill in arms belonged 
to the Americans. In fair conflict, the British were 
beaten; and they escaped ruin, only in consequence 
of a fortuitous occurrence, propitious to them, and 
unfavourable to their enemy. 

In the course of the battle occurred an individual 
affair, somewhat singular, and not without interest. 

Two young officers bearing the same rank met in 
personal combat. The American perceiving that 
the Briton had a decided superiority, in the use of 
the sabre, and being himself of great activity, and 
personal strength almost gigantic, closed with his 
adversary and made him his prisoner. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 331 

Gentlemanly, generous, and high minded, this 
event, added to a personal resemblance which they 
were observed to bear to each other, produced be- 
tween these two youthful warriors an intimacy, 
which increased, in a short time, to a mutual attach- 
ment. 

Not long after the action, the American officer 
returning home, on furlough, to settle some private 
business, obtained permission for his friend to ac- 
company him. 

Travelling without any attendants or guard, they 
were both armed and well mounted. Part of their 
route lay through a settlement highly disaffected to 
the American cause. 

When in the midst of this, having, in consequence 
of a shower of rain, thrown around them their cloaks, 
which concealed their uniforms, they were suddenly 
encountered by a detachment of tories. 

The young American, determined to die rather 
than become a prisoner, especially to men whom he 
held in abhorrence for disloyalty to their country, and 
the generous Briton resolved not to survive one by 
whom he had been distinguished and treated so kind- 
ly, they both together, with great spirit and self-pos- 
session, charged the royalists, having first made sig- 
nals in their rear, as if directing others to follow them : 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 

and thus, without injury on either side, had the ad- 
dress and good fortune to put the party to flight. 

Arriving in safety at their place of destination* 
what was their surprise and augmented satisfaction, 
on finding, from some questions proposed by the 
American officer's father, that they were first cousins! 

With increasing delight the young Briton passed 
several weeks in the family of his kinsman, where 
the writer of this narrative saw him daily, and often 
listened, with the rapture of a child, to the check- 
ered story of his military adventures. 

To heighten the occurrence, and render it more 
romantic, the American officer had a sister, beauti- 
ful and accomplished, whose heart soon felt for the 
gallant stranger, more than the affection due to a 
cousin. The attachment was mutual. 

But here the adventure assumes a tragical cast. 
The youthful foreigner, being exchanged, was sum- 
moned to return to his regiment. The message was 
fatal to his peace. But military honour demanded the 
sacrifice; and the lady, generous and high-minded as 
himself, would not be instrumental in dimming his 
laurels. 

The parting scene was a high-wrought picture of 
tenderness and sorrow. On taking leave, the parties 
mutually bound themselves, by a solemn promise, to 



LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 333 

Remain single a certain number of years, in the hope 
that an arrangement contemplated might again bring 
them together. A few weeks afterwards, the lady ex- 
pired under an attack of small pox. The fate of the 
officer we never learnt. 

The battle of the Eutaw springs being terminated, 
the movements of the two hostile armies which fol- 
lowed, were nearly the same, part of them, however, 
arising from very different motives, that had taken 
place after the action at Guilford court-house. 

In the present instance, general Greene gained the 
victory and kept the field. But to procure water 
for his suffering troops, whose canteens had been 
emptied early in the action, and, there being no 
springs or rivulets on the battle ground, he was 
obliged to fall back, immediately, to a position that 
was several miles in his rear. 

Encamping here for the night, he determined, 
after the requisite refreshment of his army, to return 
without delay, and compel the enemy to another en- 
gagement. 

Accordingly, on the morning of the 9th, the 
American light troops under Lee and Marion, re- 
ceived orders to march circuitously, and gain a po- 
sition ill the British rear. 



334 LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 

The object of this movement was twofold; to in- 
tercept such reinforcements as might be advancing 
from Charleston; and to prevent the retreat of colo- 
nel Stuart within the lines of that fortress. 

But the British leader was too much weakened, to 
risk himself any longer in the neighbourhood of his 
adversary. Conscious that he was indebted to ac- 
cident for his preservation in the last, he plainly 
foresaw, that another encounter would effectuate his 
ruin. 

So prompt was he, therefore, in his measures, and 
so precipitate in his movements, that, leaving his 
sick and wounded behind him, he made good his re- 
treat, before the American commander could reach 
him. The only injury he received in his flight, was 
from Lee and Marion, who cut off part of his rear 
guard, galled him in his flanks, killed several, and 
made a number of prisoners. 

Such was the issue of the battle of Eutaw. Like 
that of every other fought by general Greene, it man- 
ifested, in him, judgment and sagacity of the highest 
order. It proved definitively, that he never erred, in 
selecting the moment to strike his opponent. 

Although he was repeatedly forced from the field, 
it may be truly said of that officer, that he never lost 
an action — the consequences, at least, being always 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 335 

in his favour. In no instance did he fail to reduce 
his enemy to a condition, relatively much worse, than 
that in which he met him; his own condition, of 
course, being relatively improved. Hence, unless 
where the foe received reinforcements, he was, in 
every instance, solicitous to renew the battle; to avoid 
which, his adversary uniformly retreated. 

More conclusive evidence of the ability and good 
conduct of a military chief, in the discharge of his 
duty, can no where be found. Whether, in the mode 
of warfare necessary to be adopted, a commander re- 
treat, advance, delay, give battle, or avoid it, his only 
object is, to better himself relatively; in doing which 
a sufficient number of times, he is sure to triumph. 

Such was the never-failing issue of every plan of 
military operations, which Greene devised and de- 
liberately pursued. 

From the crossing of the Catawba, he retreated 
before lord Cornwallis, until the battle of Guilford, 
when the state of things was reversed, and his lord- 
ship was compelled to become the retreating party. 

Although driven from the field, by lord Rawdon, 
at Hobkirk's hill, that officer, soon afterwards find- 
ing himself unable to maintain his ground, fell back 
towards Charleston. 
Repulsed from Ninety-six, and pursued by the 
same commander, that fortress was notwithstanding 
immediately evacuated, and his lordship obliged to 
retrograde for safety. 

And finally, of the battle of the Eutaw springs, the 
last essay in arms, in which it was the fortune of 
Greene to command, the issue was, the abandon- 
ment, by the enemy, of the whole of South Carolina,, 
except the post of Charleston and its vicinity. 

Unable to bring the foe again into the field, and 
his army, from fatigue and exposure, becoming ex- 
ceedingly unhealthy, the better to provide for his 
sick and wounded, and preserve from disease the re- 
mainder of his troops, he returned, by easy marches, 
to his late salubrious encampment, on the high hills 
of Santee. 



CHAPTER X. 

Disappointed, in the promised co-operation of the French sea and land 
forces, for the entire recovery of the southern department, general 
Greene determines, again, to attempt it, single-handed — moves from 
the high hills, and takes post in the neighbourhood of Charleston- 
confines the enemy to their lines — meditates daring enterprises 
against them — projects an attack on St. John's island — one of the most 
arduous, bold, and magnificent, that marked the course of the revo- 
lutionary war — account of. — Reinforcements arrive from the North. 
— Expedition against the enemy in Georgia, led by general Wayne — 
the character of that officer — his successes and reverses — augments 
his reputation — discontents in the army of Greene — a conspiracy 
formed to deliver him to the enemy — discovered, quelled, and the 
ringleader put to death — the remainder desert to the enemy.— No na- 
tive American engaged in the plot — colonel Laurens exchanged be- 
fore his turn — difficulties in relation to assigning him a command- 
Greene's anxiety on the subject — makes an arrangement in behalf 
of Laurens — the discontent excited by it — Greene adheres to his 
purpose — The officers of Lee's legion resign. — On a suggestion from 
Greene, they withdraw their resignation, and refer their wrongs to 
congress — General Leslie, now holding the chief command of the

sent favourite and healthy position, until after the cap- 
ture of lord Cornwallis. 

He had received a promise, that on the occur- 
rence of that event, the French fleet, with a part of 
the land forces on board, leaving the Chesapeake, 
and passing round to Charleston, would co-operate 
with him, in the entire recovery of the Southern de- 
partment. But for reasons which were neither sat- 
isfactory nor liberal, this engagement, although de- 
liberate and positive, was not fulfilled; the French 
admiral refusing his services. 

With the stipulated aid, the expulsion of the foe 
from the three southern states would have been cer- 
tain and easy, Even without it, the American com- 
mander still believed, that he could force them from 
North Carolina and Georgia, confining them within 
the lines of Charleston alone. 

Chagrined by disappointment in an enterprise, 
which promised a result so decisive and glorious, he 
resolved to remain no longer inactive, but, inconsid- 
erable in numbers as his forces were, to renew the 
contest single handed. With this determination he 
decamped from the high hills, about the middle of 
November, and once more took post in the neigh- 
bourhood of the enemy. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 339 

The British had established, at Dorchester, a 
strong post, containing in regulars and tories near 
a thousand men, besides a large amount of military 
stores. 

With a view to strike, and carry this important 
garrison by surprise, Greene, leaving his main army, 
placed himself at the head of his cavalry, supported 
by two hundred infantry, and advanced on it through 
by-ways with the utmost secrecy. 

But the inhabitants of the neighbouring district 
being mostly royalists, the enemy were informed of 
his approach; and he found them, therefore, prepar- 
ed for defence. A part of them had even the auda- 
city to sally from their lines, to try their strength 
with him in open combat. But they were fiercely 
charged, and without any loss on the part of the 
Americans, driven back on their works, with consid- 
erable slaughter. 

Without attempting any thing further, or waiting 
until operations should be commenced against them, 
they burnt their stores, on the following night, and 
retreated precipitately towards the lines of Charles- 
ton. 

Disappointed in this favourite enterprise, which, 
to give it the greater certainty and effect, he had 
conducted in person, he returned to the encampment 
of the main army at the Round 0. 
Here, with the exception of the light troops under 
Lee and Marion, which were constantly on the alert, 
and often in action, to protect the country from the 
predatory excursions of the British horse, the army 
of Greene was comparatively unemployed. But 
very different was the case with regard to his own 
prolific and enterprising mind. At no former period 
had that been more uninterruptedly or intensely en- 
gaged. 

His schemes of adventure devised against the 
enemy were daring and original. Unprovided as he 
was with a maritime force, he, notwithstanding, 
meditated an attack, by land and water, on the gar- 
rison in Charleston, commanded now by major ge- 
neral Leslie. His plan was, to float a select detach- 
ment of troops down the Ashley river, in the night; 
to enter the city in that quarter, at a given hour, 
concurrently with an assault on the lines in front. 

Although obstacles insuperable prevented any actu- 
al attempt at the accomplishment of this scheme, the 
conception of it alone bore testimony to the intrepidi- 
ty and abundant resources of the general's mind; and, 
an apprehension that something of the kind was in- 
tended, produced among the enemy, who now asso- 
ciated with the name of Greene every thing that was 
formidable, great uneasiness. Invincible as they had 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 341 

found himself, they began to believe that nothing 
could resist him; but, that by stratagem or force, he 
was destined to accomplish whatever he might at- 
tempt. When an officer has thus subdued the spirit 
of his enemy, his ascendency is complete; and the 
fault is his own, if he does not destroy them. 

But the most magnificent enterprise, both in its 
nature and probable effects, which was at any time 
meditated by general Greene, and perhaps the most 
daring that marked the course of the revolutionary 
war, was that against a strong detachment of the 
British in St. John's island, under the command of 
colonel Craig. 

In the whole of this adventure, which, although 
romantic in appearance, was perfectly feasible, the 
late general (then colonel) Lee had a deep concern. 
In no other way, therefore, can we render our read- 
ers so perfectly acquainted with it, as by communi- 
cating it to them in that officer's words. 

" We have before mentioned, that major, now lieu- 
tenant colonel Craig, had taken possession of St 
John's island, with a respectable detachment. Lee 
was ordered, when detached towards that island, to 
take measures for ascertaining with exactness the 
strength and position of Craig, with his customary 
precautions against surprise, and his manner of dis- 
charging the duties which his situation imposed. 
This service was undertaken with all that zeal and 
diligence which the mandates of a chief so enlighten- 
ed and so respected, and an enterprise more brilliant 
than all the past exploits in the course of the south- 
ern war, could claim. Some weeks were assiduously 
devoted to the acquiring of a clear comprehension of 
this arduous and grand design, with an exact knowl- 
edge of the complicated means necessary to its ex- 
ecution: in the mean time, demonstrations were made 
and reports circulated, exhibiting a settled plan in 
the general of passing Ashley river, to be ready to 
fall upon Charleston as soon as the reinforcement 
under St. Clair, now approaching, should arrive. 

" Lieutenant colonel Craig, with his infantry, was 
posted at a plantation not far from the eastern extre- 
mity of the island. The cavalry were cantoned six or 
seven miles from the infantry, at different farm-hous- 
es in its western quarter. At low water the inlet di- 
viding St. John's from the main was passable by in- 
fantry at two points only, both familiar to the enemy. 
That at the western extremity ot the island was full 
of large rocks, and could be used only in the day, it 
being necessary carefully to pick your route, which 
in the deep water was from rock to rock. About mid- 
way between the eastern and western extremities

LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 343 

was the other, where no natural difficulty occurred, 
and in the last of the ebb tide the depth of water was 
not more than waist high. This was guarded by two 
galleys, the one above and the other below it; and 
both within four hundred yards of each other, as 
near to the ford as the channel would permit. 

" Lee^s examination of their position, together with 
his observation of the manner in which the captains 
of the galleys performed night duty, suggested the 
practicability of passing between the galleys with in- 
fantry unperceived. As soon as general Greene be- 
came satisfied that this difficulty could be surmounted 
he determined to hazard the attempt if a proper place 
for the cavalry to swim across, could be ascertained. 
But the deep marshes which lined the shores seemed 
at first likely to prevent the approach of the horse. 
At length major Eggleston, commanding the legion- 
ary cavalry, discovered a practicable route some dis- 
tance below the galleys. He ordered one or two of 
his dragoons to swim to the opposite shore in the 
night to select firm ground, and to erect small stakes 
as' beacons to guide the cavalry where first to strike 
the shore of the island. This was duly executed, and 
reported accordingly to the general. 

" The day was now fixed for making the attempt, 
and preparatory orders were issued. Lieutenant colo- 
nel Lee, with the light corps acting under him, being 
insufficient in strength, a detachment of infantry from 
the army was made ready and placed under lieuten- 
ant colonel Laurens, who was ordered to join Lee at 
a given point, when on his march to the theatre of 
action. 

" The plantation on which lieutenant colonel Craig 
had encamped was intersected by many ditches, as 
was usual in the cultivated grounds of South Carolina 
near the sea. One of these stretched along the front 
of the British camp, about one hundred yards dis- 
tant from it, which afforded sufficient space for the 
infantry of Craig to display in line, and which the 
assailants did not doubt the lieutenant colonel w 7 ould 
seize as soon as he should discover their advance. 

" To compensate in some measure for the advan- 
tage which the ground afforded to the enemy, the in- 
fantry of the attacking corps was rendered superior 
by one fifth to that to be assaulted. 

" Lieutenant colonel Craig, although to all appear- 
ance protected from annoyance by his insulated sit- 
uation, did not neglect the necessary precautions for 
his safety; nor did he permit any relaxation in discip- 
line, or any diminution of vigilance. The chance of 
surprising him was not encouraging; but being very 
desirable and possible, it was determined that it 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 845 

should be attempted. On the road leading from the 
ford, protected by the galleys, Craig had placed a 
picquet, about a mile from the galleys; and two miles 
further on was another, at the point where the road 
last mentioned ran longitudinally through the island. 
On the left of this point of intersection, Craig was 
encamped, three or four miles from it towards 
Charleston; and on the right of the same point were 
the cavalry, a few miles distant towards the western 
extremity of the island. Our plan was as follows. 
As soon as the infantry should effect its passage into 
the island, an officer of cavalry, who had been di- 
rected for the purpose" to accompany lieutenant colo- 
nel Lee, was tlren to return to major Eggleston with 
orders for the cavalry to pass to the island, and wait 
for the infantry near to the road of march, which 
took a direction inclining to the landing place of the 
horse. 

" The first picquet was to be'approached with the 
utmost secrecy, and then to be forced with vigor by 
the van, which was ordered to spread itself for the 
purpose of preventing the escape of any individual; 
and the cavalry had directions to take measures to 
intercept every person who might endeavour to pass 
' in their direction. We flattered ourselves with pos- 

sessing the picquet without much resistance; and 

x x 
knowing that Craig was too remote to hear the fir- 
ing, should any occur, we hoped by the interception 
of every fugitive to stop all communication with him. 
"The second picquet was to be avoided, which with 
proper care was feasible; when the infantry, support- 
ed by one troop of horse, was to advance upon Craig, 
while Eggleston with the residue of the dragoons 
would fall upon the enemy's cavalry. Succeeding in 
both points, the main body could not escape the me- 
ditated surprise, which would give to us an easy vic- 
tory: failing in arresting every individual of the post, 
or in evading the last picquet, Craig would be advis- 
ed of our approach, and would be prepared to receive 
us. In the latter event, we intended, by turning one 
of his flanks, in case he threw himself into the ditch, 
— of which, from our knowledge of his character, no 
doubt could exist,— to force him to change his front; 
and we were so thoroughly satisfied with the charac- 
ter of our troops as to assume it as a fact, that no 
corps, even of equal force, could execute the manoeu- 
vre in our face without being destroyed. In this opi- 
nion Greene concurred, and on its accuracy was 
rested the issue of the enterprise. However such a 
conclusion may wear the appearance of arrogance, 
it does not merit the reproach. The veteran troops 
in the Southern army had attained the highest grade 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 347 

of discipline. Every soldier as well as officer was 
conscious of his acquirements, and had experienced 
their good effect. They also knew that victory was 
not only the sure reward of every man's doing his 
duty in battle, but they were convinced that each 
man's personal safety was promoted by the same 
course. 

"Thus persuaded, they were habitually actuatedby 
the determination of confiding entirely in their lead- 
er, their discipline, and their valor. Such troops will 
generally succeed, and, upon this occasion, could 
scarcely fail: for the major part of Craig's infantry 
had long been in garrison at Wilmington, where 
they never had seen an enemy in arms; and his cav- 
alry were known to be very inferior to the American 
horse, and were separated from the infantry. To 
reckon, therefore, upon victory, did not manifest 
presumption; but only showed that Lee and Laur- 
ens duly appreciated the advantages they possessed, 
and were willing to stake their reputation and lives 
on the correctness of the estimate they had formed 
of them. 

" The day appointed for the execution of the enter- 
prise now arrived (21st December). Lieutenant co- 
lonel Laurens moved with his detachment from the 
main body towards the Ashley river, for the ostensi- 
ble purpose of passing the river and taking post in 
the neighbourhood of Dorchester. Halting near Ba- 
con^ bridge until late in the evening, he counter- 
marched, as if returning to camp, when after night- 
fall he turned to his left, taking the route prescribed 
for his junction with Lee. The latter officer moved 
in the same evening from his position at McQueen's 
plantation, and about nine P. M. reached the rendez- 
vous, where he was met with precision by Laurens. 
The troops halted, and took the last meal for twen- 
ty-four hours, after which they were called to arms 
and were made acquainted with the destined object. 
They were told, that the enterprise before them was 
replete with difficulties; that the most powerful of the 
manv which attended it would be met at the thresh- 
old; that this was to be encountered by the infantry, 
and could be overcome only by profound silence and 
strict obedience to orders. Success in the first step 
would in all probability lead to complete victory; in- 
asmuch as the enemy was inferior in number, divid- 
ed in position, and safe, in his own presumption, 
from his insular situation. That the plan of opera- 
tions had been approved by the general; and the 
troops now united had been honoured by his selec- 
tion of them for the purpose of concluding the cam- 
paign in a manner worthy of the zeal, courage and 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 34f* 






patience displayed by the army in all preceding- 
scenes. They were assured that every difficulty had 
been well weighed; the best intelligence with the 
best guides had been procured ; and that they could 
not be disappointed in reaping a rich harvest of 
glory, unless the commandants had deceived them- 
selves in their estimate of their intrepidity and dis- 
cipline. A burst of applause ensued from the ranks, 
evincing the delight which all felt in knowing that 
victory was certain, unless lost by their misbehaviour. 

" The disposition for battle was now made. The 
infantry was arrayed in two columns: that of Lee 
forming the right, that of Laurens the left. The cav- 
alry were also divided into two squadrons: one third 
under Armstrong was attached to the infantry; while 
the other two thirds, under Eggleston, were appro- 
priated to strike at the enemy's dragoons, with orders 
as soon as they were secured to hasten to the sup- 
port of the infantry. 

" Every necessary arrangement having been made, 
we resumed our march; and, after a few miles move, 
the cavalry filed to our left to gain its station on the 
river. Within an hour from this separation, we got 
near to the marsh, which on this side lines the river 
in the place where the infantry was to pass. Here 
the infantry again halted and deposited their knap- 
sacks, and the officers, dismounting, left their horses. 
Dr. Skinner, of the legion infantry, who considered 
fighting as no part of his business, was indulged in 
his request of being intrusted with the charge of the 
baggage. The detachment again moved; every man 
in his place; and every officer enjoined to take spe- 
cial care to march in sight of his preceding section, 
lest in the darkness of the night a separation might 
happen. 

" After some time our guides informed us that we 
were near the marsh. This intelligence was commu- 
nicated from section to section, and the columns were 
halted, as had been previously concerted, that every 
officer and soldier might pull off boots and shoes to 
prevent the splashing which they produced when 
wading through water, to be resumed when we reach- 
ed the opposite shore. The order was instantly and 
cheerfully executed by the troops. Entering on the 
marsh, we moved very slowly, every man exerting 
himself to prevent noise. The van, under Rudolph, 
reached the shore, and proceeded, in conformity to 
orders, without halting into the river. Lee coming 
up with the head of the column, accompanied by 
lieutenant colonel Laurens, halted and directed a 
staff officer to return and see that the sections were 
all up. We now enjoyed the delightful pleasure of 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 351 

hearing the sentinels from each galley crying " all is 
safe" when Rudolph with the van was passing be- 
tween them. 

" No circumstance could have been more exhilarat- 
ing, as we derived from it a conviction that the diffi- 
culty most to be apprehended would be surmounted, 
and every man became persuaded from the evidence 
of his own senses, that an enemy assailable only in 
this way would be found off his guard, and, therefore, 
that victory was certain. At this moment the staff of- 
ficer returned with information that the rear column 
was missing. Laurens immediately went back to the 
high land with some of the guides and staff officers 
to endeavour to find it. The affliction produced by 
this communication is indescribable. At the very 
moment when every heart glowed with anticipations 
of splendid glory, an incident was announced which 
menaced irremediable disappointment. 

" Hour after hour passed; messengers occasionally 
coming in from Laurens, and no intelligence gained 
respecting the lost column. At length the tide, which 
was beginning flood when the van passed, had now 
risen so high as to compel the recal of Rudolph, even 
had not the morning been too far spent to admit per- 
severance in the enterprise. A sergeant was sent 



$52 LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 

• 

across the inlet with orders for the return of the van, 
and the column retired. 

"Rudolph found the water, which had not reached 
the waist as he passed, up to the breast as he return- 
ed. Nevertheless every man got back safe; the tallest 
assisting the lowest, and the galley sentinels continu- 
ing to cry u all safe." We soon regained our baggage, 
where large fires were kindled, and our wet troops 
dried themselves. Here we met general Greene, who 
had, in conformity with his plan, put his army in mo- 
tion to draw near to the theatre of action, lest a body 
of troops might be pushed across the Ashley to inter- 
cept the attacking corps in its retreat from the island; 
and with a view of compelling the galleys to abandon 
their station, that Lee might retire on the next low 
tide where he had passed, it being the most conveni- 
ent route. He received with regret the unexpected 
intelligence, rendered the more so, as he was well 
assured that the enemy would learn the intended en- 
terprise, and, therefore, that it could never be again 
attempted. 

" As soon as the day broke, the last column, — which 
had been completely bewildered, and was, if possi- 
ble, more unhappy at the occurrence than were its 
chagrined comrades,— regained the road taken in 
the night, and was now discerned by those who had 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 353 

been searching for it. Laurens returned with it to 
our baggage ground, most unhappy of the unhappy. 

" On inquiry it was ascertained that the leading 
section, instead of turning into the marsh, continued 
along the road, which led to a large plantation. Here 
the error was discovered, to which was added ano- 
ther. Instead of retracing his steps, the senior offi- 
cer, from his anxiety to rejoin without delay, took 
through the fields under the guidance of a negro, it 
being the nearest route, and again got lost, so very 
dark was the night; nor was he even able to reach 
the road until directed by day light. 

"Thus was marred the execution of an enterprise 
surpassed by none throughout our war in grandeur 
of design, and equalled by few in the beneficial effects 
sure to result from its successful termination. Cen- 
sure attached no where; for every precaution had 
been adopted to guard against the very incident 
which did occur, and, dark as was the night, the 
troops had nearly completed the most difficult part of 
the march without the least interruption. The officer 
of the leading section of Laurens' column was among 
the most attentive and trust-worthy in the army, and 
yet the blunder was committed by him which led to 
our disappointment. The whole corps lamented the 

deranging occurrence^ especially Laurens, who re- 

Y 7 
proaclied himself with having left his column, pre- 
suming the accident would not have happened had 
he continued in his station. This presumption may 
be correct, as that officer was singularly attentive to 
his duty; and yet his absence being necessary, it 
could not be better supplied than it was. The pas- 
sage of the river was the essential point, that on which 
the expedition hung; and Laurens being second in 
command, it was deemed prudent, — as lieutenant co- 
lonel Lee would necessarily pass with the front col- 
umn for the purpose of directing those measures in- 
tended to be applied against the enemy^s picquet the 
moment our rear reached the island, — that lieutenant 
colonel Laurens should repair to the river, and there 
continue to superintend the troops as they entered in- 
to the water, lest the sections might crowd on each 
other, and thus increase the noise, a consequence to 
be dreaded and guarded against; or, by entering too 
high up or too low down the stream, miss the ford 
and get into deep water. 

" Laurens left his column by order to give his per- 
sonal superintendence to this delicate operation; and, 
therefore, was entirely exempted from any participa- 
tion in the production of the unlucky accident which 
occurred. 



LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 355 

* General Greene assuaged the sorrow which the 
baffled troops so keenly felt, by thanking them as they 
arrived for the exemplary manner in which they had 
conducted themselves, and for the ardent zeal they 
had displayed in the abortive attempt to execute the 
enterprise committed to their skill and courage. He 
lamented the disappointment which had occurred., 
but declared it to be owing to one of those incidents 
which so often take place in war, and against which 
upon this occasion every precaution had been adopt- 
ed which prudence could suggest. He attributed the 
accident to the darkness of the night, and, by com- 
mending all, forbad the censure of any. Not satisfied 
with this oral declaration to the troops, the general on 
his return to camp, addressed a letter to each of the 
lieutenant colonels, repeating his thanks to them and 
to their respective corps. 

" How often do we find military operations frustra- 
ted by the unaccountable interposition of accident, 
when every exertion in the power of the commander 
has been made to prevent the very interruption which 
happens? No doubt these incidents generally spring 
from negligence or misconduct; and, therefore, might 
be considerably diminished, if not entirely arrested, 
by unceasing attention. When the van turned into the 
marsh, Lee, as has been mentioned, halted to give a 



35ti LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 

minute or two for taking off boots and shoes, and 
did not move until lieutenant colonel Laurens, who 
had been sent for, came up and informed him that 
every section was in place. From this time Laurens 
continued with Lee, and in the very short space which 
occurred before the leading section of Laurens reach- 
ed the point of turning into the marsh did the mis- 
take occur which put an end to our much desired en- 
terprise. Lieutenant colonel Lee believing the inter- 
vention of mistake impracticable, as the sections were 
all up, and as the march through the marsh would be 
slower than it had been before, did not direct one of 
his staff, as he had done heretofore, to halt at the 
point where the change in the course of the route 
occurred. This omission cannot be excused. This 
precaution, although now neglected in consequence 
of the official communication then received that the 
sections were all in place, and the short distance to 
the marsh, — the experience of this night proves that 
however satisfactorily the march may have been con- 
ducted, and however precisely in place the troops 
may be, yet that no preventive of mistake should be 
neglected. Had the practice been followed at the 
last change of course, which had uniformly taken 
place during the previous march, the fatal error 
would not have been committed, and this concluding 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 357 

triumph to our arms in the South would not have 
been lost. 

" The state of Georgia might probably have been 
recovered by the effects of this severe blow; as the 
northern reinforcement soon after joined us, and ge- 
neral Leslie would have found it necessary for the 
security of Charleston to have replaced the troops 
lost on St. John's island, which could not be so con- 
veniently done as by drawing to him the garrison of 
Savannah. Hitherto Greene had struggled to recov- 
er the country far from the ocean: now he contempla- 
ted its delivery even where British troops were pro- 
tected by British ships, but was baffled by this night's 
accident. The spirit of disaffection, which had al- 
ways existed among the inhabitants of Charleston^ 
had been vigilantly watched by the British comman- 
der, as he was no stranger to its prevalence. When 
lord Rawdon evacuated Camden, this spirit became 
so formidable, in consequence of the success of the 
American arms in the South, as to induce his lord- 
ship to continue with his army at Monk's corner, un- 
til the arrival of three regiments from Ireland ena- 
bled him to leave behind an adequate force ibr the 
security of that city during his resumption of offensive 
operations. Subsequent events promoted this dispo- 
sition, and the capture of the army under earl Corn- 
wallis gave to it full energy. Nor can it be doubted 
that, had Greene succeeded in destroying the corps 
under lieutenant colonel Craig, this spirit would have 
been turned to his co-operation, in case general Les- 
lie had been so imprudent as to rely upon his reduced 
garrison for the defence of Charleston after the junc- 
tion of our reinforcement from the North. We may, 
therefore, safely pronounce that general Greene did 
not err in his calculations of restoring Georgia to the 
Union in the event of his success against Craig, and 
we sincerely lament that his bold design should have 
been frustrated by the derangement which occurred." 

By order of general Greene, a British galley ly- 
ing in Ashley river, mounting twelve guns and seve- 
ral swivels, and manned with forty-three seamen, 
was captured and burnt, without loss, by captain 
Rudolph of Lee's legion. On this well conducted, 
and brilliant little affair, general Lee makes the fol- 
lowing remarks. 

" Thus the tone of enterprise continued high and 
vigorous on our side, while low and languishing with 
the enemy., The novelty of this successful attempt at- 
tracted notice in Charleston ; and such was the state 
of despondency wlych prevailed in its garrison as to 
give currency to opinions calculated still further to 
depress the humbled spirit of the British soldier. 






LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 359 

When it was found that even their floating castles, the 
pride and bulwark of Englishmen, were successfully 
assailed by landsmen, the water quarter of the town, 
which was accessible by water, necessarily became 
an object of jealousy. Every alarm in the night ex- 
cited dire apprehensions: sometimes Greene was 
moving to force their lines; at other times he was 
floating down the Ashley; and in one way or another 
he was ever present to their disturbed imaginations." 

Reinforcements, led by major general St. Clair, 
having arrived from the army of the north, disposi- 
tions were made, without delay, to act with effect 
against the enemy in Georgia. 

The first object of this arrangement was, to pro- 
tect the country from predatory excursions: but the 
chief officer had it also in charge, to reconnoitre with 
care the garrison of Savannah, and, should the en- 
terprise appear practicable, attempt it by assault. 

The command of the expedition was conferred on 
brigadier general Wayne, who had recently arrived 
from the northern department, and for ardour, gal- 
lantry, intrepidity of spirit, and all that urges to deeds 
of valour, stood unrivalled among the officers of his 
rank. So strong was the affinity of his soul for dan- 
ger, that he appeared to court battle for its own 
sake, and to hold even the scroll of glory cheap, un-

less its characters were traced in blood. Yet, as a 
man, he was eminently tender and humane, suscepti- 
ble of all the softer affections, remarkable for the 
warmth and steadiness of his friendships, and greatly 
beloved for his social virtues. 

His career in the service now assigned him, was 
singularly checkered with success and misfortune. 
But if, on any occasion, he justly incurred the impu- 
tation of negligence, his firmness and courage nobly 
sustaining him in every emergency, and making the 
best possible amends for antecedent remissness, he 
acquired, in the end, an increase of reputation. 

From this period, until the close of the war, an 
interval of many months, nothing occurred of brilli- 
ancy or exploit, to bestow on the character of the 
commander of the south additional liistre. Yet, at 
no former conjuncture, however portentous, had he 
duties to perform, or difficulties to encounter, that 
called more imperiously for the exercise of all the 
powers of his intellect, and for all his acquired expe- 
rience and skill. 

Added to his usual circumspection in relation to 
his enemy, he had now to watch the deportment, and 
pry into the spirit of his own troops, with a suspi- 
cion and jealousy that were peculiarly painful to him. 

While employed in the active operations of the 



LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 361 

field, his army had thought of nothing but the con- 
quest of the foe. But a season of inaction had af- 
forded them leisure to reflect on their own condition, 
which, injustice, must be acknowledged to have been 
extremely comfortless. 

For their country they had done and suffered 
much; while it, in return, had done but little for them; 
and, in their estimation, appeared to undervalue the 

services they had performed. Of their pay a very 

» 

heavy arrearage was due to them, and no competent 
arrangement made for discharging it: their supply of 
provisions, miserable in quality, was scanty and pre- 
carious; and, although winter was at hand, they were 
actually destitute of blankets and clothing. 

Greene's own letters, at this period, present a 
forcible picture of the deplorable condition, to which 
the army was reduced, and the infinite difficulties he 
had to encounter in keeping the field. 

" I would order, says he, to the secretary at war, 
iC the returns you require, but we really have not pa- 
per enough to make them out; not having had, for 
months past, even paper to make provision returns, 
or to record the necessary returns of the arrny." 

Again — " since we have been in the lower country, 
through the difficulty of transportation, we have been 
four weeks without ammunition, while there was 



z z 
plenty of this article in Charlotte. We lay within a 
few miles of the enemy with not six rounds a man. 
Had they got knowledge and availed themselves of 
our situation, they might have ruined us." 

" You can have little idea of the confusion and 
disorder, which prevail among the southern states. 
Our difficulties are so numerous, and our wants so 
pressing, that I have not a moment's relief from the 
most painful anxieties." 

" A great part of our troops are in a deplorable 
situation for want of clothing. We have three hun- 
dred men without arms; and more than a thousand 
so naked, that they can be put on duty only in cases 
of a desperate nature. We have been all winter in 
want of arms and clothing. The subsistence of the 
army is wretched, and we are without rum or any 
other kind of spirits." 

Superadded to the deep anxieties he felt on ac- 
count of the suffering condition of his army, general 
Greene experienced solicitudes exceedingly painful, 
from considerations of a personal nature. 

" I was well informed, said he, in a letter to the 
secretary at war, that you had let in some prejudices 
to my disadvantage; such as my being more influenc- 
ed by men than measures; and that, in the field, I 
had neither activity nor enterprise. However mortify- 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 363 

ing these things were, my pride would not suffer me 
to undeceive you; and such was my situation, at the 
time, that it would have been difficult, if not impossi- 
ble, had I attempted it. My military conduct must 
speak for itself. I have only to observe, that I have 
not been at liberty to follow my own genius, until late- 
ly; and here I have had more embarrassment, than 

it is proper to disclose to the world. Let it suffice 

i 

to say, that this part of the United States has had a 
narrow escape. I have been seven months inthejkld $ 
ivithout taking my clothes off one night!" 

Under difficulties so numerous and complicated, to 
keep the field in the vicinity of the enemy, and so 
conceal his real condition, as to hold them in check, 
by presenting a bold and formidable aspect, bespeaks 
in general Greene, such a plenitude of resources, as 
has never been surpassed in any commander. 

In consequence of their situation, as here depicted, 
discontent among the troops, which was first heard 
in murmurs, burst forth in loud and general com- 
plaint. 

Nor had the evil yet attained its climax. Part of 
the soldiery became tainted with treason; and a con- 
spiracy was formed, to seize the person of Greene 
and deliver him to the enemy. An arrangement to 
that effect was f understood to have been settled in a 
correspondence with a British officer; and so fully was 
the project matured, that a party of Tarleton's horse 
advanced, as was believed, to the place where they 
expected to receive their prisoner. 

But the vigilance of Greene was not to be eluded; 
his penetration and discernment could not be over- 
reached; nor did his decision pause as to the course 
to be pursued. The plot was discovered and defeat- 
ed; the ringleader apprehended, tried, and shot, and 
twelve of the most guilty of his associates, deserted 
to the enemy. Two of the general's domestics were 
strongly suspected; but the evidence of their guilt 
being insufficient to convict them, they escaped pun- 
ishment. 

To the honour of the American character, no na- 
tive of the country was known to be concerned in 
this conspiracy. Foreigners alone were its projectors 
and abettors. 

Thus was another scheme of treason, conducted, 
indeed, by individuals of humbler rank, but equally 
daring with that of Arnold, and, in the present pos- 
ture of affairs, not likely to prove much less fatal in 
its consequences, happily defeated. At this critical 
moment, the surrender of the commanding general 
to the enemy, would have produced the dissolution 
of the southern army. For, suffering and deeply 






LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 365 

discontented as they were, Greene was, now, the 
Washington of his troops. He held them together, 
and kept them to the faithful discharge of their duty, 
much more by the attachment they bore his person, 
and the pride they felt in fighting under his banner, 
than by the terms of their enlistment, or a spirit of 
subordination. 

Greene's conduct on another occasion, in prevent- 
ing a meditated mutiny of the Maryland line, mani- 
fested sound judgment, and a perfect knowledge of 
human nature. 

Having already caused to be tried and shot, the 
only open abettor of the crime he had been able to 
detect, he thus expressed himself, in general or- 
ders. 

" One or two, of artful dispositions, are sufficient 
to betray hundreds of well disposed men into errors. 
But the general is happy to find, that the Maryland 
line has nobly withstood the secret machinations of 
such as have attempted to mislead them: nor can he 
believe that soldiers who have fought so bravely, and 
whose character is universally admired, will ever tar- 
nish their glory by improper conduct." 

To a soldier versed in battle, and proud of his re- 
putation, an appeal like this, is much more power- 
ful than the fear of death. 
The most prevalent and dangerous crime of the 
southern army was that of desertion. To suppress 
this, the commanding general was obliged to be ex- 
ceedingly rigorous in his government. Hence arose 
the frequency of executions; which, in proportion to 
the number of his troops, was greater under the ad- 
ministration of Greene, than in any other division of 
the American army. 

Within a short period afterwards, there occurred, 
in his army, another event, extremely delicate and 
difficult to be managed. 

Colonel Laurens, a native of South Carolina, and 
a young officer of splendid abilities, having become 
a prisoner at the time of the fall of Charleston, had 
been exchanged antecedently to his regular turn, and 
had recently joined the southern army. 

This violation of order and usage, in the libera- 
tion of that gentleman, being considered an act of 
unwarrantable partiality, gave serious offence to 
those officers who had been captured before him, 
and were still permitted to remain in the hands of 
the enemy. 

The reasons assigned for this procedure, although 
sufficiently specious, were not deemed satisfactory, 
especially by those who suffered by the act. They 
were, the superior services which it was alleged 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 367 

colonel Laurens would be able to render to his na- 
tive state, now the chief seat of war in the depart- 
ment of the south; and, that, being aid to general 
Washington, the commander in chief, he ought not 
to be held subject to the common rule of exchange. 

In this transaction, however, which had been the 
work of congress alone, general Greene had no more 
concern than any other officer. 

But, in relation to colonel Laurens, there existed 
another difficulty, which gave the general great un- 
easiness, and embarrassed him not a little in the ad- 
ministration of his command. 

That gentleman was now in his family, and was 
expected to receive, in the line of the southern army, 
a station suitable to his rank. 

From his desire to gratify what he believed to be 
the wish, not only of congress, but of the comman- 
der in chief, as well as from his knowledge of the 
preeminent worth of colonel Laurens, Greene was 
solicitous to confer the expected command. No 
vacancy, however, at present existed; and should 
one occur, it could not be thus filled, without injus- 
tice to other officers, who, from services rendered in 
the southern department, had superior claims. 

The anxiety of Greene, to confer on colonel Lau- 
rens a suitable appointment, was much heighten- 
ed, by intimations he had received from head-quar- 
ters. He had learnt, on authority not to be ques- 
tioned, that he himself was there represented in 
whispers, as inordinately ambitious: that he was said 
to have been, of late, less communicative to general 
Washington, than circumstances warranted; and, 
that, supposed to be vain of his laurels in the south, 
he was suspected, like Gates, after the victory of 
Saratoga, to be aspiring to the station of commander 
in chief. 

That general Washington entertained a jealousy 
so groundless and unworthy, had not been intimated. 
Nor, pure as he held the spirit, and elevated the sen- 
timents of that illustrious man, did Greene believe 
such an error possible. He was not mistaken. 
Washington harboured no such suspicion. 

Unwilling, however, either to perform or omit, an 
act, which, with any shadow of probability, jealousy 
itself might construe against him, he had resolved 
from the beginning, to create an opportunity, should 
laone present itself, to gratify colonel Laurens in the 
wished for arrangement. 

In the enterprise against St. John's island, he had 
associated him with colonel Lee, hoping that the 
brilliancy of victory might justify preferment. But-, 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. S69 

the adventure had failed, and with it, the prospect of 
facility from that quarter. 

His health having suffered from the services and 
exposure of a long continued campaign, Lee had 
asked and obtained, permission to retire from the 
command of the legion. But the vacancy thus 
created, afforded no relief to the embarrassment of 
Greene. 

To bestow on colonel Laurens that station, the 
most desirable, because the most honourable of its 
rank connected with the army, neglecting officers 
who had participated abundantly, in the dangers and 
glories of the late campaign, was alike inconsistent 
with justice and prudence. 

To remove, as far as possible, all existing impedi- 
ments, the legion being augmented, was erected into 
a brigade, and general Gist appointed to lead it, 
having under his command colonel Baylor at the 
head of the cavalry, and colonel Laurens at that of 
the infantry. , ■ / 

Here again arose a difficulty, that had not been 
anticipated. 

While led by colonel Lee, the infantry and cavalry 
of the legion had been united. Long associated, 
therefore, in their fatigues and dangers, their mis- 
fortunes and triumphs, they had formed attachments 

3 A 



370 LIFE OP GENERAL GREEJNE. 

which it was painful to sever. Besides, having re- 
peatedly witnessed each others gallantry and prowess 
in battle, a reciprocal confidence had been thus en- 
gendered, which sustained their firmness in every 
emergency. When contending side by side, how- 
ever greatly outnumbered by the foe, they were 
strangers to fear, or apprehensions of disaster. Mu- 
tually, but not supinely relying, each man encourag- 
ed by support in which he trusted, and determined 
to do his duty, no less for the safety of his friend 
than of himself, they thought of nothing but certain 
victory. 

But, by the new organization of the corps, these 
comrades and friends were unexpectedly separated, 
and placed under the command of different officers. 
This unwelcome derangement of their associa- 
tions and habits, did not fail to produce discontent. 
The soldiers murmured, and the officers remonstrat- 
ed, in terms that were wanting in respect to their 
commander. 

Greene replied with dignity and moderation; but 
adhered with firmness to his new dispositions. 

This, on the part of the officers of the legion, was 
followed by an actof inconsiderate rashness. Chagrin- 
ed at their disappointment, and aware of the stern 
inflexibility of their leader, and, therefore, without 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 371 

further hope of bending him to their purpose, they 
unanimously resigned their commissions, and asked 
leave to retire from service. 

Although this event was unexpected and embar- 
rassing to Greene, and might have proved in a high 
degree disastrous to the army, yet it produced in 
him no relaxation of measures, nor any change in 
the organization of the light brigade, with a view to 
calm the discontented, or reclaim the delinquents, 
He simply apprized the officers about to retire, of 
their right to appeal to congress, alleging that that 
body would redress whatever injury, or violation of 
privilege, they might have sustained from the injudi- 
cious decisions, or arbitrary rule of their command- 
ing general. Conscious of the purity and rectitude 
of his intentions, and persuaded that his late arrange- 
ments were, in the main, calculated to promote the 
good of the service, he made no overture to induce 
them to remain. 

These officers were generous and high minded; 
but they had acted hastily, and under strong irrita- 
tion. Passion had usurped the seat of reason, and 
hurried them to a deed, that could not fail to sully 
their reputation, and might prove, in the end, des- 
tructive to their comrades. They had received from 
their general many favours. He had distinguished 



$12 LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 

them by his applauses, assigned to them uniformly 
the post of honour, passed indulgently over their faults, 
and, through every vicissitude of situation and for- 
tune, toiled incessantly for their comfort and safety. 
To abandon him now, in the face of the enemy, for 
a single measure, even admitting it to be arbitrary 
and wrong, would be ungrateful and unsoldierly. It 
would manifest, in them, a preference of self to their 
love of country, falsify that sentiment of devotion to 
the cause of freedom, they had always professed, and 
be a stain on the laurels they so highly prized. 

Under these reflections, eagerly availing them- 
selves of the suggestion of their commander, they 
withdrew their resignations, returned with invigorat- 
ed alacrity to their duty, and referred tfeeir grievan- 
ces to the decision of congress. 

Having antecedently effected the conquest of his 
enemy, Greene had now achieved the last act of 
consummate generalship, a victory over his officers, 
his army, and himself. • 

The disasters of the enemy, in the last campaign, 
had rendered certain, at no distant period, the evac- 
uation of the fortresses at present in their posses- 
sion, and the return of peace. Besides the capture 
of an entire army, led by the bravest and most ac- 
complished of their generals, they had lost, in the 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 373 

south, a number of posts with their garrisons and 
stores, and all the territory they had previously con- 
quered. To attempt to recover, with diminished 
means, what had thus been wrested from them, 
when in greater force, worse than a common effort 
of despair, would have been a convulsive and un- 
availing struggle of madness. Convinced of this, 
general Leslie lay inactive within the lines of 
Charleston. 

The only exception to a state of perfect inactivity, 
on his part, arose from the necessity of procuring 
supplies of provision for his troops. This he was 
compelled to do, by marauding incursions into the 
neighbouring country, which were often productive of 
skirmishing and slaughter. 

Weary of this useless effusion of blood, and having 
announced his intention to evacuate Charleston, the 
British commander expressed to general Greene, a 
sincere desire to discontinue these incursions, pro- 
vided he could be permitted to purchase provisions 
for his army, unmolested, and at a fair price. 

To this proposal, which was both wise and hu- 
mane, the American general, had he been empow- 
ered to act on it, would have readily acceded. But 
to decide in relation to it, belonged to the civil an- 
thority of South Carolina; which, from well-meant 
but mistaken motives, unfortunately rejected it. 

The consequence was, a necessary continuance of 
predatory warfare, until it ultimately led to a very 
serious disaster. The accident was individual: but 
misfortune in war is to be estimated by worth, rather 
than by numbers; on which ground that alluded to 
could scarcely have been exceeded. In repelling the 
last incursion, attempted by the British, Gist^s brigade 
sustained an irreparable loss in the much lamented 
fall of colonel Laurens. 

Cultivated and accomplished in person and intel- 
lect, possessing the wisdom of age happily blended 
with the ardour of youth, valiant to excess, full of re- 
sources, and passionately devoted to the cause of in- 
dependence, a champion more chivalrous, or an offi- 
cer of higher promise, did not grace the ranks of 
freedom. x 

With as near an approach to perfection, as it is the 
lot of humanity to attain, his life became a sacrifice 
to the short sighted policy of his native state. 

Had the peaceful offer of Leslie been accepted, 
Laurens might have lived, to deliberate with the wis- 
est, and contend with the most eloquent, in the coun- 
cils of his country, as he had already vied with the 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 375 

most heroic, that constituted the nerve and pride of 
her armies. 

v 

From this period, although peace was not yet pro- 
claimed, nor had any formalities touching a cessa- 
tion of hostilities, passed between the rival leaders, 
the ravages of war were permitted to cease, and the 
two armies to enjoy repose, under a full persuasion, 
that it w 7 ould not again be interrupted, by the hurry 
of preparation, or the din of battle. 

At length, much to the satisfaction of all concern- 
ed, general Leslie had completed his arrangements 
for evacuating Charleston. Although general Greene 
now believed in the approach of that event, and con- 
fided in the sincerity of the enemy in relation to it 
he was too well acquainted with the unlooked for vi- 
cissitudes in human affairs, to place himself in any 
measure within the power of accident. Unrelaxing 
therefore, in all his measures, he held himself in a 
state of preparation to act, precisely as time and oc- 
currences mia;ht direct. 

It having been finally settled, as a condition of the 
preservation of the city, that the enemy should not be 
molested during their embarcation, the evacuation 
took place on the 14th of December, 1782, the 
American van entering the lines, just as the British 
rear had left them. 



376 LIFE OF GENERAL GREECE. 

To the inhabitants of Charleston, who were dis- 
tinguished for their loyalty in the cause of freedom, 
this was a day of returning joy, and rapturous exul- 
tation. Long exhausted, except what had been kind- 
ly distilled into it by the hand of hope, but now 
abundantly replenished from various sources, their 
cup of felicity was ready to overflow. 

For more than twenty months, they had been in 
the hands of their enemy, subject to the restrictions 
of a garrison establishment, and all the rigours of mi- 
litary rule. Their lives, their liberties, and their en- 
tire possessions, had been, during that period, at the 
mercy of a fee, not very scrupulous in his opinions 
of right, or in exercising the power of the victor over 
the vanquished. 

But these severities and privations were now ex- 
changed, for freedom of action, the return of law. 
and the watchful and indulgent protection of their 
friends. 

Nor was the joy inspired, by a change so propi- 
tious, embittered by an apprehension that it would 
be fleeting in its duration. On the contrary, it was 
greatly enhanced, by a confidence that it would be 
lasting. The circumstances under which the enemy 
had been compelled to depart, presented a guaranty 
that they would not return. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 377 

With these considerations were connected others, 
that were no less consolatory. For some time past, 
the tumult of war having been gradually subsiding in 
other quarters, the sword had been suffered to rest in 
its scabbard. Although the star of peace, therefore, 
had not yet arisen, the eastern horizon was brighten- 
ing with its beams. 

Embracing, then, in their generous rejoicings, the 
present welfare, and the future prospects of their fel- 
low citizens at large, the inhabitants of Charleston 
foresaw, in their own emancipation, the final recog- 
nition of the Independence of their country. Super- 
added, therefore, to personal considerations, the joy 
of patriotism ennobled the spectacle, by lifting the 
soul above the region of self. 

But the occasion, precious in its nature to the lov- 
ers of peace, and dear to every patriotic bosom, was 
rich in sources of tenderer felicity. Friends, who 
had been separated and long kept asunder, by the 
casualties of war, and excluded from a knowledge of 
each others fate, were once more united, with sensa- 
tions of delight, which, far beyond the power of lan- 
guage to portray, must be left to the heart of sensibili- 
ty to conceive. Nor can justice even thus be done 
to them, except by those, who, under grievous priva- 
tions, having experienced the " sickness of hope de- 

3 b 
felted" have been healed by the balm of returning 
enjoyment. Parents, wives, sisters, and other rela- 
tives, lately the victims of corroding sorrow, but now, 
with susceptibilities heightened by past sufferings, 
and frantic with joy from present objects, flying to 
the embraces of sons, husbands, brothers, and kins- 
men, whom they had supposed to be lost, presented 
such a scene of tumultuous beatitude, as man has but 
rarely been privileged to witness. One more exqui- 
site, it is not within the dispensations of heaven to be- 
stow., unless the nature of our race were changed, 
and our capacities of fruition multiplied or enlarged. 

But the indulgence of private feeling, however de- 
lectable, was of transient duration. A public duty 
remained to be performed, which soon engrossed 
universal attention. It was, with hearts overflowing 
with gratitude and love, to do honour to the man, to 
whom, under providence, all were indebted for the 
present intoxicating draught of felicity. Nor has duty 
been ever more faithfully performed. 

Suddenly, as if every other consideration had es- 
caped from the memory, Greene became the object 
of undivided regard. When, conducting into the ca- 
pital the civil authority of the state, he advanced, at 
the head of a body of cavalry, no tongue ventured, at 
first, to interrupt the silence that every where pre- 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 379 

vailed. The eye seemed for a time to be the only 
organ capable of action. Nor was it until that was 
satisfied with gazing, that the lips ventured to give 
utterance to the overflowings of the heart. 

Expressions of admiration and gratitude, faint at 
first, grew louder and louder, until the vast assem- 
blage of spectators, united in a mingled tribute of 
thanks, applauses, and benedictions, to him, whose 
wisdom and valour had stayed the desolating sword 
of war, rescued them from the sceptre of military 
despotism, and given them, in prospect, a certainty of 
freedom, independence, and peace. 

From every quarter congratulatory addresses 
were presented to Greene; banquets, balls, and other 
festive entertainments, public and private, were pro- 
vided for his gratification; fire-works and illumina- 
tions were brilliantly exhibited; and all that a liber- 
ated and generous people, in the jubilee of their soul, 
could devise to amuse or delight him, were expen- 
sively prepared. To crown the whole, in places of 
public worship, thanks were solemnly oiFered to the 
God of battles, for the various successes of the 
American arms, and the signal deliverance, the city 
had experienced. 



380 LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 

Such was the reception of the conqueror of the 
south, in the chief city of the department he had de- 
fended. 

In the midst of this prodigality of admiration and 
honour, never did man deport himself more meekly. 
Retiring from the* blaze of public distinction, Greene 
alone appeared to be unconscious of the merit which 
attracted it: another proof, subjoined to the many be- 
fore existing, that greatness and modesty are mostly 
united. 

"Were we inclined to indulge in a spirit of contem- 
plation, a subject more attractive than that which here 
presents itself could scarcely be selected. 

A military leader, successful in a mighty contest 
where the choicest interests of humanity were at 
^take; now reposing from the toils of war, in the 
midst of those, whom his arms had defended; the idol 
of the time, yet equally unmoved by the surrounding 
pageantry, as he had formerly been by the shock of 
battle; rejoicing in the attentions, so liberally bestow- 
ed on his gallant army, but declining the offerings df 
homage to himself; looking on the past with an eye 
of satisfaction, and regarding the future with the 
cheerfulness of hope; but deriving, for the present, 
his highest reward, from a recollection of duties 
faithfully performed, and the concomitant approba- 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 381 

tion of a peaceful conscience — Such a leader, and 
under circumstances thus imposing, was the hero of 
the southern department in the bosom of Charleston. 
Moulded into symmetry by all the virtues, brightened 
by military glory, and crowned by moral grandeur, 
on a more august object the eye of mortal can scarce- 
ly alight. 

The triumphal pomp of Roman conquerors, where 
captives were degraded by pride and cruelty, and 
merit obscured by vanity and ostentation, is much 
less attractive. Tell, when he had broken the chains 
of Switzerland, Alfred, reascending the throne of his 
ancestors after the conquest and expulsion of the 
enemy, and Bruce, having achieved the freedom of 
Scotland, present to the mind of patriotism images 
that awaken its finest sensibilities. But, acting on a 
much more limited scale, their condition was inferior 
in interest to that of Greene. 

Shaded by laurels, derived from his glorious suc- 
cesses at York-Town, rendered still more illustrious 
by the recent victory achieved by his virtues over 
the discontents of his army at Newburgh, and con- 
secrated by the blessings of a liberated people, Wash- 
ington alone, in resigning his commission, surpassed 
the spectacle!

The destructive operations of the war being now 
terminated, the army of the south was no longer en- 
dangered by the sword of the enemy. But prudence 
forbidding that it should be yet disbanded, and the 
means of the Carolinas being entirely spent, it soon 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 383 

became, in a degree that was alarming, oppressed by 
want and threatened with famine. 

This painful and distressing destitution arose also, 
in part, from a neglect of the public authorities of 
the southern states, to provide for an army, whose 
services they no longer wanted, and whose welfare 
and accommodation, therefore, too soon ceased to be 
an object of their care. 

Impatient of their sufferings, and exasperated at 
the supposed ingratitude of the people they had de- 
fended, the troops, encamped in the neighbourhood 
of Charleston, began to manifest a spirit of mutiny. 
To such an extreme had their insubordination at- 
tained, that they were ready to march into the city, 
and supply themselves with food and clothing at the 
point of the bayonet. Even the authority of their be- 
loved and venerated commander was forgotten or 
disregarded, in the keenness of their necessities, or 
the fierceness of their resentment. 

To prevent his army from sullying its laurels, by 
outrage and injustice, and to save the inhabitants of 
Charleston from a renewal of military exaction, 
Greene was prepared for every sacrifice, to which 
man could submit. He had even resolved, if violence 
were attempted, and milder measures should fail to 
suppress it, to throw himself in front of the mutinous 
soldiers, with such of his officers as might choose to 
accompany him, and cut down every man that should 
disobey orders, or fall himself in the unequal conflict. 

To those acquainted with the history of that dis- 
tinguished prince, it is well known, that a public 
avowal of a resolution like this, and under circum- 
stances not dissimilar, constituted one of the most 
heroic events in the life of Bernadotte of Sweden. 

But fortunately, in the affair of Greene, matters 
were adjusted, without a resort to sanguinary means. 

Mr. Banks, a native of Virginia, was now the con- 
tractor of supplies for the army. He had, at this mo- 
ment, large contracts existing in Charleston; but for 
want of money or sufficient credit, was unable to 
get possession of the articles purchased. 

Information of this was communicated to Greene. 

So severe was the pressure, and so threatening 
the aspect of things, that not a moment was to be 
lost. The army, naked and starving, had become 
ungovernable, and the inhabitants of Charleston 
were trembling for their safety. 

Under these circumstances, Greene, urged by mo- 
tives of patriotism, humanity, and military honour, of- 
fered himself security in the contracts of Banks. 
The pledge was accepted, the contractor became 
possessed of the public supplies, and their urgent 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 385 

wants being promptly removed, the troops returned 
contented to their duty. 

In this transaction, so important to his country, the 
commander of the army exhibited much more of the 
virtue of the patriot, and the devotion of the officer, 
than of the policy, of the man of the world, or the 
prudence of the man of business. He was led to it 
by the same feeling, that would have induced him, in 
battle, to sacrifice his life. 

The sum for which he became security was large; 
amounting to treble the value of his estate. His 
country might assume the payment, and relieve him 
from the obligation; but it might also refuse, in 
which case his ruin was inevitable. As hehad often- 
times before, therefore, hazarded his life for the 
public welfare, it cannot be denied, that for the same 
object, he now put at hazard his fortune and his 
hopes. An act so perfectly disinterested and noble, 
must have arisen from feelings which none but the 
patriotic and the high minded cherish. 

But as there are said to be insects, which extract 
from the rose a deadly venom, so are there individu- 
als, who derive a poison from virtuous actions. Rare,- 
ly has this truth been more abundantly manifested, 
than in the present instance. 

3 c 
Banks being a speculator, his object was gain. 
Nor was he delicately scrupulous in his means of at- 
taining it. He had no objection, therefore, when an 
opportunity offered, to abuse the public confidence to 
his private emolument. Being unsuccessful in his 
speculations, and unable consequently to meet his 
engagements, he finally failed for a large amount; 
and the investigation of his affairs did not terminate 
to the advantage of his character. 

Like every great and virtuous man, Greene had 
enemies among the low-minded and envious; who, 
unable to reach his gigantic elevation, were anxious 
to depress him to their own level. Having been as- 
sociated with Banks, in the transaction referred to, 
he was represented, by these, as associated with him 
generally, in his schemes of traffic. In fact, he was 
daringly stigmatized, as a lawless speculator, whose 
mercenary views should subject him to pay, from 
his private means, the amount of the bonds, into 
which he had entered. 

An accusation more foul in principle, or unfound- 
ed in fact, never issued from the tongue of malice. 
In consequence of it, the conduct of Greene in his 
whole connexion with Banks, was solemnly investi- 
gated at the bar of congress, by some of the most 
upright and intelligent men of the nation. In this 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 887 

scrutiny, general Hamilton was actively concerned. 
The result proved, as every man of intelligence was 
confident it would, in a high degree honourable to 
the reputation of Greene. From the witnesses and 
documents that w 7 ere examined, there appeared no 
shadow of ground to arraign his motives. On the 
contrary, their purity and the general uprightness of 
his character were incontestably established. An of- 
ficial paper containing a decision to this effect, was 
prepared and deposited in the archives of the nation, 
and the debt for which his estate had become liable^ 
was finally paid out of the public treasury. Many- 
years having elapsed after his death, before this de- 
cision took place, the matter not being finally adjust- 
ed until about the year 1796, his personal influence 
could not be regarded as efficient in the procure- 
ment of it. It was a spontaneous act of justice by 
the government, in behalf of the reputation and es- 
tate of an officer, whose integrity was as spotless as 
his services had been pre-eminent. 

It is a maxim in business, that in many instances, 
a delay, is as bad as a denial of justice. This, to a 
certain extent, was true in the case of general 
Greene. From the tardiness of the public councils in 
investigating his claims, he sustained great disquie- 
tude of mind, and no inconsiderable loss of property. 
So unfaithful was the country to the feelings and the 
interest, of one of her brightest ornaments and ablest 
defenders. 

Peace being at length restored, and his country 
no longer in need of his services., Greene, without 
waiting for the disbanding of the army, which was 
provided for by congress, withdrew from the south, 
and returned to the bosom of his native state. 

The reception which he there experienced, was 
cordial and joyous. The authorities of the common- 
wealth welcomed him home, with congratulatory ad- 
dresses, and the chief men of the place waited on 
him at his dwelling, eager to testify their gratitude 
for his services, their admiration of his talents and 
virtues, and the pride with which they recognized 
him as a native of Rhode Island. 

Although Greene, from the modesty of his disposi- 
tion, and his love of sincerity, shrunk from the pomp 
of mere public compliment, yet the attachment to 
his person manifested, on this occasion, by his kins- 
men and neighbours, was peculiarly grateful to him. 
It awakened in his mind, a lively recollection of his 
early years, when the play of the affections gave a 
zest to enjoyment, and those who were now doing 
honour to him, as a leader of armies, and a champion 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 889 

of freedom, had been his companions in the sports 
and amusements of youth. He received, therefore, 
his numerous visitants, with the courtesy of a gentle- 
man, softened and endeared by the sensibilities of a 
friend. 

His residence in Rhode Island was short. But 
during the continuance of it, he had the good for- 
tune to render to the state an important service. 

Many of the inhabitants, especially in the town 
and neighbourhood of Newport, had been tinctured 
with toryism; and some of them had borne arms in 
the ^cause of royaltv. 

Against those deluded and unfortunate men, who 
were now anxious to return to their violated loyalty, 
and many of whom promised to become valuable 
citizens, the resentment of the whigs was fiery and 
inexorable. Nothing could satisfy it short of the ban- 
ishment or extermination of the obnoxious individu- 
als, and the confiscation of their estates. So exaspe- 
rated were the parties, and to such an extreme had 
the ferment arisen, many of the tories having pre- 
pared to defend themselves, that the state was threat- 
ened with civil war. If any of the more temperate 
and enlightened of the whigs, attempted to restrain 
the violence of their associates, their motives became 
suspected, and their safety endangered. 



Such was the unsettled and alarming condition of 
things, when Greene returned triumphant from the 
south. 

By the liberal and well disposed of both parties, . 
his arrival was hailed as a providential occurrence. 

In consequence of his popularity, and the love and 
veneration his fellow citizens bore him, it was per- 
ceived that his influence in the state must be great; 
and from the moderation of his character, and the 
magnanimity of his spirit, it was confidently antici- 
pated, that he would be the advocate of mild and pa- 
cific measures. As a statesman, he was believed to 
be too wise and politic to countenance unnecessary 
severity; and as a soldier, too high minded to tolerate 
insult or injury to a foe that had submitted. 

Nor did public expectation, as to these points, 
sustain a disappointment. The benevolence of his 
heart extended to the unfortunate of every descrip- 
tion. Desirous that even those who least deserved it, 
might participate in the blessings for which he had 
fought, an earnest endeavour to remove the prejudi- 
ces, and assuage the animosities of the whigs and 
tories, constituted one of his earliest acts of peace. 

Some of the leading whigs, from most parts of the 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 891 

state, having assembled at Newport, Greene addres- 
sed them publicly with great effect. 

He drew a lively and forcible picture of the moral 
duties of clemency and mercy, representing, in strong 
and impressive terms, their universal obligation and 
extensive prevalence. 

He declared, that under every form of government 
and every ruler, it had been found politic and wise, 
that the close even of a rebellion should be followed 
by an act of general amnesty, from which none but 
the most flagrant offenders were excluded. 

The claims of the tories were still stronger. They 
were not rebels, but deluded citizens, in whose de- 
fection many palliating circumstances were to be 
found. In the part they had acted, during the late 
contest, having violated no pre-existing law, they had 
forfeited no allegiance; and it was his firm belief, that 
most of them had been misled by honest prejudices. 
Their conduct, therefore, although erroneous and re- 
prehensible, could not, in the true acceptation of the 
term, be denominated treasonable. But were it so, 
such of them as had neither taken a lead in opposi- 
tion, nor been guilty of any dark and heinous atroci- 
ties,^ — those of them whose hands were unpolluted 
with blood— were surely entitled to pardon, on re- 






§92 LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 

nouncing their errors and manifesting a disposition 
to return to their duty. 

Needless severity he pronounced to be wanton 
cruelty. And where, he asked, in the present case, 
existed the necessity for rigid measures? 

Such measures could be necessary and useful only, 
when contributing to the attainment of certain con- 
templated ends. — To humble the spiritof the disaffect- 
ed, and render them obedient to government and law. 
— To defeat any mischief they might plot against the 
state. — Or to prevent them from again proving faith- 
less to their country, in case of hostilities with a for- 
eign power. 

But no such ends were now to be answered. The 
tories, already sufficiently humbled, were professing 
their obedience and soliciting protection. In that 
view of the subject, therefore, every thing to be de- 
sired was already attained. To press the matter fur- 
ther, would be not only superfluous, but unmanly and 
unjust. 

As to the second point — the prevention of meditat- 
ed mischief — the united force of the British and the 
royalists having been already successfully resisted, 
from the latter, single-handed, no danger could be 
reasonably dreaded. The timid alone could entertain 
such an apprehension; and he confidently trusted, 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 393 

that among the whigs of Rhode Island, few such 
were to be found. 

Nor could an argument in favour of rigid mea- 
sures be derived from the third topic of consideration; 
it being extremely improbable, that any war would 
occur, in future, in which the native inhabitants of 
the country would feel inclined to take part with the 
enemy. Under these circumstances, to make public 
examples, would be to inflict punishment from mo- 
tives of vengeance, and not with a view to its only 
fair and legitimate ends, the reformation of the cul- 
prits, and as a warning to others. 

The general further stated his conviction, and ven- 
tured to pledge his reputation on the issue, that those 
who had been disaffected, would be found, hereafter, 
among the most loyal and faithful of our citizens. 
Their allegiance to their king had been the ground 
of their hostility to the cause of freedom. But the 
bond of duty in that compact being solemnly cancel- 
led, they would be found, in future, to adhere with 
equal steadiness and good faith, to the constitution 
and government of their native country. Their late 
defection might even be regarded as an earnest of 
such adherence. 

He further represented, that the strength and se- 
curity of a nation, as well as the cultivation of its soil 

3d 
the natural and most permanent source of its wealth, 
depended essentially on the number and density of its 
population. By the waste of human life, in the late 
war, the population of the United States had been 
already thinned. To reduce it further, by the ban- 
ishment or death of a large proportion of the inhabi- 
tants, would be a policy in the highest degree unwise 
and injurious. It would impose on us the necessity 
of replenishing it by means of foreign emigration. 
And it was not to be expected, that entire strangers 
would be as loyal or useful, as the natives of the 
country. 

He concluded by stating, that it was not only cus- 
tomary, it was an evidence of virtue in individuals 
and communities, to express, by acts of clemency and 
mercy, their joy and gratitude for signal favours. 

On the achievement of a great victory, the com- 
mander of an army pardons those who are under sen- 
tence for military offences. The youthful prince, on 
bis elevation to a throne, throws open the prison doors 
of his kingdom, and sets free the guilty. 

He, therefore, declared, that the blessings of peace, 
and the prospects of happiness, having npw revisited 
us, to persist in a scheme of inexorable persecution 
against the royalists, would manifest unbecoming pas- 
sions, and be unworthy of the wisdom of the politi- 



LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 395 

cian, the magnanimity of the soldier, and the hu- 
manity of the man. 

His reasoning being deemed conclusive, he proved 
the happy instrument of directing the public mind to 
its true interest, protecting the unfortunate, and re- 
storing harmony to his native state. 

On this occasion, he generously bestowed on the 
royalists of Rhode Island, the same favours that ge- 
neral Hamilton did on those of New York, and 
Patrick Henry, on those of Virginia. He saved 
them from banishment, their property from confis- 
cation, and even the persons of many of them from 
the swords of their countrymen. In this struggle, 
his merit was the greater, as, notwithstanding the 
amount of his sufferings and services in the cause 
of freedom, he sustained, for a time, on account of his 
interference, the deep odium of many of the whigs. 

On the close of the war, the three southern states 
that had been most essentially benefited by his wis- 
dom and valour, manifested, at once, their sense of 
justice, and their gratitude to Greene, by liberal 
donations. 

South Carolina presented him with an estate, on 
the river Edisto, valued at ten thousand pounds ster- 
ling: Georgia, with an estate, on the river Savannah, 
a few miles from the city of the same name, worth 
five thousand pounds: and North Carolina, with 
twenty-five thousand acres of land, on Duck river, 
now in the state of Tennessee. Of these estates, 
the two former have passed out of the family ; but 
a portion of the latter is still retained by them, and 
is extremely valuable. 

Having spent about two years in his native state, 
in the adjustment of his private affairs, appropriating 
his leisure hours to liberal studies, especially those 
of history, metaphysics, and the principles of civil 
policy, he sailed for Georgia, in October 1785, and 
settled, with his family, on his estate near Savannah. 

Engaging, here, in agricultural pursuits, he em- 
ployed himself closely in arrangements for planting, 
exhibiting the fairest promise to become as eminent 
in the practice of the peaceful virtues, as he had al- 
ready shown himself in the occupations of war. For 
so various were his excellencies, and so lofty his en- 
dowments, that in no walk of life could he fail to be 
distinguished. 

But it was the will of Heaven, that in this new 
sphere of action, his course should be limited. The 
short period of seven months was destined to wit- 
ness its commencement and its close. 

Walking over his grounds, as was his custom, 
without his hat, on the afternoon of the 15th of June 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 397 

1 786, the day being intensely hot, he was suddenly 
attacked with such a vertigo and prostration of 
strength, as to be unable to return to his house, with- 
out assistance. The affection was what is denomi- 
nated a " stroke of the sun. " It was succeeded by 
fever, accompanied with stupor, delirium, and a dis- 
ordered stomach. 

Being in high health, at the time of his attack, 
his habit plethoric, and his temperament inflamma- 
tory, the disease was violent, and its progress ra- 
pid. It was a southern complaint, fiercely invading 
a northern constitution. All efforts to subdue it 
proving fruitless, it terminated fatally on the 19th of 
the month. 

The sudden death of a man so distinguished, be- 
loved, and venerated for the past, and whose future 
life promised, so lately, to be long and illustrious, was 
felt throughout the south, as an afflicting calamity. 

Intelligence of the event being conveyed to Savan- 
nah, but one feeling pervaded the place. Sorrow 
was universal ; and the whole town assumed in- 
stinctively the aspect of mourning. All business was 
suspended, the dwelling houses, stores, and shops 
were closed., and the shipping in the harbour half- 
masted their colours. 
On the following day, the body of the deceased 
being conveyed to the town, at the request of the in- 
habitants, was interred in a private cemetery with 
military honours, the magistrates and other public 
officers of the place, the society of the Cincinnati, 
and the citizens generally joining in the procession. 

As soon as the funeral ceremonies were finished, 
the members of the Cincinnati assembled in their 
hall, and adopted unanimously the following resolu- 
tion : 

" That, as a token of the high respect and vene- 
ration, in which this society hold the memory of 
their late illustrious brother, Major General Greene, 
deceased, George Washington Greene, his eldest son, 
be admitted a member of this society, to take his 
seat, on arriving at the age of eighteen years. " 

To the sincere sorrow of all that knew him, and 
the disappointment of the fondest hopes of his coun- 
try, this youth, whose early virtues and vigorous in- 
tellect, promised a manhood of usefulness and renown, 
was drowned in the river Savannah, before he had 
attained the age of maturity. 

On the 12th of August, of the year in which the 
General died, the Congress of the United States 
unanimously resolved : 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 399 

" That a monument be erected to the memory of 
the Honourable Nathaniel Greene, at the seat of the 
Federal government, with the following inscription. 

SACRED 

to the memory of 
the Honourable NATHANIEL GREENE, 

who departed this life, 

the nineteenth of June MDCCLXXXVI; 

late Major General 

in the service of the United States, 

and commander of their army 

in the southern department. 

The United States, in Congress assembled, 

in honour of his 

patriotism, valour, and ability, 

have erected this 

MONUMENT. 

To the disgrace of the nation, no monument has 
been erected ; nor, for want of a head-stone, or 
other memorial, can any one, at present, designate 
the spot, where the relics of the Hero of the South 
lie interred ! ! 

Having dwelt somewjiat extensively on the ser- 
vices of Greene, in the capacity of an officer, it is 
our purpose to be brief on his character as a man. 

To this we are induced, by two considerations. 



Private character is much more an object of indi- 
vidual curiosity, than of general interest, or public 
importance. A representation of it may amuse and 
entertain ; but it is rarely calculated to instruct or 
improve. This is more especially the case with mili- 
tary commanders, who have been long concerned in 
the operations of the field. All, or, at least, most 
that is interesting in their lives, consists in public 
action. In private life, they are well-bred gentlemen, 
warm friends, good husbands, and agreeable com- 
panions ; but, being neither writers, philosophers, 
politicians, nor mechanists, they seldom do any thing 
more, in their peaceful character, than rest from their 
labours, enjoy society and govern their families. 

But this is not all. It is impossible to give a full 
and faithful representation of the private character 
of an individual, without a personal and intimate ac- 
quaintance with him. Neither an inspection of his 
familiar letters, nor the minutest narratives of those 
who knew him, can qualify a writer for so delicate 
a task. He who trusts to such materials, may com- 
pose a pleasing fancy-picture, but can never succeed 
in giving a faithful portrait. 

As well might an attempt be made to enable a pain- 
ter to draw a likeness, by a verbal description of the 
countenance, or an exhibition of a few of the features. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 401 

separately, of the person to be painted. Nothing but 
an actual inspection of the face, can qualify an artist 
to delineate it. Nor can a competent preparation 
to paint the mind and manners, be derived from any 

i 

other source. 

Without pretending, therefore, to give a perfect 
delineation of the private character of Greene, who 
was personally unknown to us, we hope that the fol- 
lowing traits of him as a man, will be acceptable 
to those, who delight to dwell on his merits as an 
officer. 

His intellect was of masculine texture and strength. 
Sound, penetrating and capacious, rather than bril- 
liant, judgment and sagacity were its predominant 
features. He possessed, in a high degree, the capa- 
city to profit, by observation and experience, and 
placed much reliance on that source. Without this 
qualification, no mind can be practically great; no 
individual wise. 

In his perceptions he was quick and clear, ready 
in his combinations, forcible in his reasonings, and 
prompt in his decisions. 

His acquaintance with human nature, derived from 
history and an intercourse with man, was extensive 
and profound; and, in his apprehension of the tendency 
of principles, no man committed fewer mistakes. 

% E 
Hence, of a number of schemes of action submitted 
to his examination, or arising in his own mind, he 
had a peculiar facility in distinguishing that which 
best suited in his present condition. As if guided by 
the lights of intuition itself, it is not recollected that 
when left to consult his own judgment, he ever during 
his military career, erred in his selection. However 
extraordinary, or even extravagant, this statement may 
appear, it is believed to be true. On these occasions, 
although deeply thoughtful, yet so rapid were the move- 
ments of his mind, that the result seemed an act of per- 
ception, rather than deliberation. This w r as one of the 
most fruitful sources of his ability as a commander. 
It enabled him to decide, while others were doubting; 
to employ in action, the time which they consumed 
in deliberating. 

For the zeal and sedulity with which he pursued 
knowledge, at every period of his life, he had 
no equal, among officers of rank, in the American 
army. His portable library was well chosen and 
rich; and on occasions of the utmost perplexity and 
danger, when the probability of a night attack for- 
bade him to undress himself, and in the midst of his 
greatest fatigues, not excepting the evening after a 
battle, he never retired to rest, until he had spent ait 
hour or two in reading. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 403 

Of historians, Hume was his favourite; of metaphy- 
sicians, Locke; of poets, Shakspeare and Milton; of 
the ancient classics, Horace. The latter work he 
carried constantly in his pocket, and read it fami- 
liarly, partly for his amusement, and, in part, that he 
might retain his knowledge of the Latin tongue. 
For, although deprived of the advantages of an early 
and liberal education, his classical attainments had 
become, by his own industry, in the midst of active 
engagements and the toils of war, highly respectable. 
This information is derived from one of the first 
scholars of our country, who communicates it on the 
ground of personal knowledge. 

He possessed uncommon equability of temper, 
and, on most occasions, was a perfect model of self- 
command. Yet he was no less remarkable for the 
high-toned sensibility and ardour of his mind. He 
was also capable of great abstraction. Hence, when 
preparing for action, or engaged in battle, so strong 
was his excitement, as to render him insensible to 
every thing but his duty as a commander. All per- 
sonal considerations being merged in the desire of 
victory and the love of glory, he seemed unconscious 
of the danger to which he sometimes exposed himself. 

On the score of morality, he was unimpeachable. 
Roman virtue, in the best days of the republic, was 
never more unsullied and inflexible than his. Of 
him it was as true as of the elder Pitt, that " modern 
corruption had not touched him." 

Conscientiously devoted to duty, he never, in his 
private transactions, intentionally violated punctuality, 
much less integrity. As a public functionary, his 
honesty was unquestioned, except in the affair of 
Banks; and, there, like sterling metal, it was bright- 
ened by the ordeal through which it passed. So 
sound and impenetrable was his whole moral cha- 
racter, that all imputations directed against it, either 
fell harmless at his feet, or recoiled on those, from 
whom they proceeded. 

For the bubble popularity, inflated by the breath 
of the multitude, his contempt was deep. Nor had 
he any respect for those who covet it. The courtier 
and the sycophant, he held to be weak, or hypocriti- 
cal and dishonest. With no time-serving disposition, 
or accomodating flexibility of character himself, but 
acting steadily on established principles, he consi- 
dered as dangerous and unworthy to be trusted, all 
who were governed by different motives. He has 
been heard to declare, that he would as soon confide 
his personal safety to a vessel at sea, driven by varia- 
ble winds, without a steersman, as the management of 
his own, or any of the concerns of his country, te 



LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 405 

the direction of an individual, who did not adhere to 
recognized principles as the guide of his actions. 

Resolution of purpose he regarded as the rampart 
of virtue; and the want of it, as a breach, through 
which, sooner or later, vice must enter. To waver, 
therefore, when determination was required, was to 
forfeit at once his confidence and esteem. 

Notwithstanding his rigid devotion to business, 
his disposition was social, he was fond of rational 
amusement, and, during his hours of relaxation from 
severer duties, took great delight in mingling with his 

friends. 

In conversation he was fluent and instructive, al- 
ways lively, and sometimes playful. To wit he made 
no pretension. His powers of sarcasm were terrible. 
But he never, by a wanton indulgence of them, gave 
pain to the unoffending, the modest or the well-bred. 
It was the forward and presuming that were doomed 
to feel him; and he frequently punished the rude and 
impertinent, by the most poignant retorts. 

When conversing with men of enlightened minds, 
his favourite topics were political economy, and the 
principles of government. On these subjects, his 
views, which were always liberal, had, by reading 
and reflection, been rendered profound. It was the 
opinion of his friends, that he was preparing himself 
for a recommencement of his public career, in a 
civil capacity. Were this* the case, and had his life 
been prolonged until the organization of the federal 
government, his station would have been high. Wash- 
ington would certainly have invited him to his cabinet. 
Notwithstanding his firmness and decision, in 
most things, his disposition was eminently mild and 
humane. These amiable qualities threw into his 
public character a degree of softness that was pecu- 
liarly attractive. Hence, as a commanding officer, 
he never acted with unnecessary harshness, nor in- 
flicted punishment, unless where the good of his 
country required it. 

To this trait he is believed to have been indebted 
for the preservation of his life, during his southern 
campaigns. The tories, apprised of it, from expe- 
riencing its effects, were induced to spare him, 
when within reach of their rifles; some of them, per- 
haps, from motives of gratitude; but most of them, 
from an apprehension, that in case of his death, he 
might be Succeeded by a commander, who would 
visit their disaffection with greater severities. Such, 
at least, is the belief, which he himself is known to 
have entertained. 

In the technical signification of the term, he was 
no writer. Yet few men knew better the power 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 40? 

of words. Hence, in his private and official letters, 
his language is well selected, and his style, disin- 
cumbered of every thing ornamental or redundant, 
remarkable for its condensity, perspicuity and 
strength. His communications descriptive of the* 
battles he fought, are masterly specimens of that 
kind of writing. The enemy themselves admired 
and applauded them. Delighted with their simpli- 
city and picturesque character, some of the British 
officers were heard to declare, that "no man in 
either army, except general Greene, knew how to 
describe a battle." Certainly no man described one 
so well. His letters, on these topics, are rather pic- 
tures than accounts of the actions represented. 

In friendship, he was warm, sincere, and steady. 
As a gentleman and a neighbour, courteous, kind 
and obliging. Although he did not, during his short 
residence in Georgia, mingle much in society, yet, 
strangers and visiters were welcomed to his dwel- 
ling, with the open and generous hospitality of the 
south. 

In his diet he was always temperate; at times, ab- 
stemious. Careful of his health, he often, with a 
view to the preservation of it, abstained, for a day 
or two, from animal food. This course he judi- 
ciously preferred to the frequent employment of me- 
dicinal potions, a practice too commonly pursued in 
warm climates. 

In his domestic relations, he was amiable and ex- 
emplary. As a parent he was peculiarly affectionate 
and indulgent, as far as indulgence can be accounted 
a virtue. The education of his children, embracing 
moral and religious, as well as literary instruction, 
constituted an object of his anxious regard. To 
make amends for the defects of public schools, whicn 
were, at that period, few and faulty, in the southern 
states, he employed a private tutor, who resided in 
his family. 

In managing the concerns of his estate, he com- 
bined strict method, with liberal economy. 

His appearance, although dignified, was not suffi- 
ciently imposing to be very forcibly expressive of 
his character. He had the aspect of a general offi- 
cer; but it was that of an intrepid rather than a 
great one. 

His stature, which was nearly six feet, did not, to 
the eye, seem to rise above the middle standard, on 
account of the roundness and breadth of his shoul- 
ders, and a forward inclination of his neck and 
head. His frame was muscular and powerful but 
defective in symmetry. As he advanced in yeans, he 
became somewhat corpulent, which injured still fur- 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 409 

ther the proportions of his person; in consequence 
of an injury received in his youth, he was slightly af- 
fected with lameness; not, however, in a degree suffi- 
cient, to impair materially his activity of body. An 
excellent horseman, he mounted with ease, and rode 
with elegance. Nor were there many that could 
surpass him in exercises on foot; and although 
somewhat weakened in his general health, by ex- 
posure and intense application to duty, he vied with 
the hardiest in toil and fatigue. 

His head exceeded the middle size, and was finely 
moulded. His features were bold, and his visage 
comely, but bore no marked resemblance to either 
the Greek or the Roman model. His countenance 
was expressive of the mildness and benignity of the 
philanthropist, rather than the stern purposes of 
the warrior. His hair was light, and his com- 
plexion, fair and ruddy in youth, became deeply em- 
browned by the southern climate. His forehead 
was lofty and expanded, but his eye was by far the 
finest of his features. It was large and full, though 
not very prominent, capable of unusual motion, its 
colour a deep blue, and under high excitement, 
seemed to swim in liquid fire. On these occasions, 
his whole countenance was peculiarly irradiated by 

the workings of his intellect.

A short time before the commencement of the 
American revolution, he married into a respecta- 
ble family, in his native state. He left behind him 
five children, two sons and three daughters, the 
eldest of whom, as already stated, was unfortunately 
drowned. The other four are still living and mar- 
ried, the son in the state of Rhode island, one 
daughter on Cumberland island, in Georgia, and the 
other two in the state of Tennessee. 

They are sufficiently wealthy for all the purposes 
of comfort and elegance; and, in intellect and infor- 
mation, moral virtue, and ornamental accomplish- 
ments, worthy of the distinguished name of Greene. 
In society they are treated with marked respect, 
partly in acknowledgment of their own merit, but 
no less on account of their father's fame. 



CONCLUSION. 

JlN attempting an estimate of the military character 
of general Greene, we must derive our elements from 
a variety of sources. Of these, the most important 
are, his native propensity to the profession of arms, 
the rapidity of his promotion after an entrance into 
military life, the opinion of cotemporary and com- 
petent judges, and the number and extent of his pro- 
fessional achievements, considered in relation to the 
means by which they were effected, and the charac- 
ter of the enemy he was called to encounter. 

He was born and educated in the bosom of a so- 
ciety of christians, one of the distinguishing features 
of which is, an adherence to peace under all cir- 
cumstances, and a conscientious disavowal of the 
principles of war. Of this society he was a regular 
member; and his attachments to it were sincere and 
strong. Yet, in opposition to the force of first impres- 
sions, early habits, and the remonstrance of friends, 
he not only deliberately violated its tenets, but submit- 
ted to a solemn act of rejection, rather than forego 
the gratification of his passion for arms. 



<b\2 LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 

But, as a general rule, a predominant propensity 
to any one of the distinguished walks, or professions 
of life, if not the result, is, at least, an evidence, of a 
genius to excel in it. It is the finger of an instinct 
which rarely errs, pointing the soul to its proper 
destiny: the surest indication which nature offers, of 
a peculiar adaptation of the means to the end. 

Of the truth of this, could we descend to particu- 
lars, testimony ample and satisfactory might be ad- 
duced. 

It is well known, that in the case of eminent math- 
ematicians, musicians, painters, poets, mechanicians, 
and others, such has often been the ascendency of 
the ruling passion, that no restraint, however forci- 
ble, could withhold the individual from his chosen 
pursuit. 

From this source, then, we consider ourselves fair- 
ly authorized to infer, that general Greene possessed 
a genius adapted by nature to military command. 

After resorting to arms, his attainment of rank 
was much more rapid, than that of any other officer 
Dur country has produced — perhaps the most rapid 
that history records. 

It has been already stated, that in October 1774, 
he commenced his career, as a private in the Ken- 
tish guards, and in May 1775, was created brigadier 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE, 413 

general, with the chief command of the militia of 
Rhode Island. In August 1716, he was pron .oted, 
by congress, to the rank of major genera] in the 
regular army; in March, 1778, he reluctantly accept- 
ed, as a favour to his country, the office of quarter- 
master general: and in October or Noveii ler 1780, 
was appointed to the chief command of all the forces 
in the southern department. 

These offices, so high in responsibility and honour, 
were conferred on him, not as matters of personal 
favour or family influence; nor yet through the in- 
strumentality of political intrigue. They were re- 
wards of pre-eminent merit, and tokens of recognized 
fitness for the highest functions of military service. 

It was mentioned on a former occasion, that of all 
his associates in arms, general Washington consider- 
ed Greene best qualified lor the command in chief, in 
case of his own disability or death. That such was 
his opinion, had he never avowed it, we have conclu- 
sive evidence, in his nomination and high recommen- 
dation of him to congress, to conduct the war in the 
southern department. This was virtually to confide 
to him that appointment: for, while engaged in service 
to the south, it cannot be denied, that Greene held 
the prerogative, and administered the duties of com- 
mander in chief, as unequivocally, and under circum- 



414 LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE. 

stances as critically trying, as Washington himself 
did, in the department of the north. 

Washington's exalted opinion of Greene may be 
further inferred, from the well known fact, that, when 
accessible, he always consulted him in difficult emer- 
gencies, and received his sentiments with peculiar 
deference. Instances are not wanting, where, with 
the commander in chief, the judgment of Greene, 
was more than a counterbalance, to that of all the 
other general officers of the army. 

It has been further stated to us, on authority which 
we cannot question, that in the nomination of Greene, 
as chief of the southern army, Washington experi- 
enced great perplexity. He knew him to be the officer 
best suited to that station, but, from his perfect reli- 
ance on him in times of difficulty, he was in the highest 
degree reluctant to dispense with his services from 
under his own immediate command. In this, how- 
ever, as in all other instances, his love of country 
triumphed over every selfish propensity, and he per- . 
mitted his favourite to march to the south. 

But, the sentiment of Greene's fitness for the sta- 
tion of commander in chief, was not confined to 
Washington alone. It was universal with the Ameri- 
can military; the French officers warmly concurred 



LIFE OP GENERAL GREENE, 415 

in it; and, as early as the year 1777, it was enter- 
tained by a large majority of congress.* 

Nor was its prevalence limited here. Towards the 
close of the war, especially during the success of the 
American arms in the south, the whole country 
united in the opinion; and, had any fatality befallen 
general Washington, Greene would have succeeded 
him without opposition. 

Even the enemy he conquered, did homage to his 
pre-eminent talents for war. Tarleton, who must be 
acknowledged to have had strong ground to know him, 
bestows on him, in his " Campaigns in the Southern 
Provinces of North America," several lofty and well 
deserved encomiums ; and is reported to have pronounc- 
ed him, on a public occasion, the most able and ac- 
complished commander that America had produced. 

But it is from the number, importance, and lustre 
of his actions, and the uniformity of his successes 
against the enemy, contrasted with the usual inferi- 
ority of his means, much more than from any other 
source, that the military character of Greene is to be 
deduced. 

When acting under the orders of others, he not 
only never failed to discharge, to their satisfaction, 

* The honourable Thomas T. Paine, then a member of congress from 
Boston, communicated this fact to colonel Pickering;. 
the duties entrusted to him, however arduous, but 
received, for the most part, for the excellence of his 
conduct, their commendations and thanks. 

Of the truth of this, abundant evidence may be 
derived from the affairs of fort Lee, of Brandywine, 
of Germantown, of Monmouth, of Springfield, of 
Rhode Island, from his administration of the quarter- 
master department, and his operations against lord 
Cornwallis in the state of New Jersey. 

But it is the southern department of the union, that 
constitutes the theatre of his achievements and fame. 
It was there, where his views were unshackled, 
and his genius free, that by performing the part of 
a great captain, he erected for himself a monument 
of reputation, durable as history, lofty as victory and 
conquest could render it, and brightened by all that 
glory could bestow. 

When he first took command, in the department 
of the south, his means were feeble, and his prospects 
appalling. His troops, exceedingly limited in num- 
ber, were humbled in spirit, and destitute of every 
thing that gives comfort, content, and efficiency to 
an army. 

Two states were already conquered, and a third 
about to be invaded by a foe, overwhelming in force, 
flushed with victory, led by the ablest of the British 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 417 

commanders and amply provided in all the equip- 
ments and requisites of war. 

Yet, finding in himself, wresting from his enemy, 
or creating in the midst of the destitution that sur- 
rounded him, the resources required, he attempted 
from this period no scheme ,of military operations, in 
which he did not virtually succeed. 

If he gave ground, or refused battle, it was only 
to gain time, reinforcements, or means, to make vic- 
tory sure. 

His celebrated retreat from the Catawba to the 
Dan, with his subsequent advance, and masterly 
movements in the county of Guilford, give evidence 
of the truth of this assertion. Avoiding battle until 
sufficiently prepared, yet, by a policy not to be resist- 
ed, preventing the foe from abandoning the tract of 
country where he meant to attack him, he struck 
him at length with such decisive effect, that, from 
that moment the ascendency became his. 

The spirit of tor\ism, on which the enemy relied, 
was thus extinguished in North Carolina; lord Corn- 
wallis obliged to fly to escape destruction; and the 
state soon afterwards relieved from the invading 
army. 

His advance on South Carolina, with an enemy 

in his rear, that might cut him off fipjn his re-

sources and hopes of succour from the north, was 
regarded, by every one, as a daring, and, by many, 
as a rash and perilous, movement. But, events soon 
proved, that, replete with wisdom, it was the concep- 
tion of a great practical intellect, fitted for gigantic 
projects in war. It w^as the commencement of a sys- 
tem of military operations, capacious in its outline, 
and, which, urged with skill and vigour in the de- 
tails, shook to its centre the British power in the 
south, and effected, in a short time, its entire extinc- 
tion.* 

* In the exposition of his reasons for penetrating- into South Carolina, 
after the battle of Guilford court-house, Greene manifested great pow- 
ers of military combination. 

He pronounced that movement the best that could be made; because, 
being least expected by the enemy, it would most disconcert them, and 
they would be, therefore, in the worst state of preparation to meet it. 

Lord Cornwallis, said he, meditates an invasion of Virginia, and has 
doubtless already made arrangements to take the command, and co- 
operate there, with general Philips. Should he change his views, and 
pursue me into South Carolina, much good may result from the measure. 

Virginia being relieved from part of her pressure, the enemy will be 
expelled from that state, or conquered in it, and succours immediately 
forwarded to me in the south. 

But in case his lordship, whose army is already reduced, persist in his 
present determination, and join general Philips, their united force can 
be successfully opposed by the state of Virginia, with such aid as may 
be afforded from the north. 

In either case, North Carolina will be free from the pressure of the 
foe, and can direct her means as circumstances may require — to my 
assistance, should 1 need them; to Virginia, should it be more advise- 
able. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 419 

The policy and achievements of Greene, at this 
period of his campaigns, were alone sufficient to im- 
mortalize his name. Incompetent, still, to cope with 
his adversary, in a general engagement, he confined 
himself rigidly to a war of posts, compelling the 

Further. Let lord Cornwallis follow me into South Carolina, with his 
utmost speed, I shall be so far in advance of him, as to have beaten lord 
Rawdon, and captured some of his posts, before his arrival. Id that 
case, I shall be fully prepared for a second meeting with his lordship; the 
more so, as the presence of an army in the state, will encourage the 
whigs of South Carolina to assemble in arms, and augment our force 
by joining our standard. 

But if, on the contrary, I march into Virginia, the state of South 
Carolina considering herself abandoned, her spirit of freedom will be 
extinguished, by despair, the whigs will submit, toryism triumph, and 
all resistance in that quarter cease. 

Nor is this all. Lord Rawdon being unemployed, will invade North 
Carolina, paralyse the energies of that state, if he does not conquer it, 
augment his force by an accession of tories, and even carr\ his arms, 
perhaps, into Virginia. 

Hence we shall be compelled to contend in the latter state with the 
concentrated powers of the enemy, without the least prospect of aid 
from any part of the south. 

But, admitting the greatest evil that can happen, on my marching 
for South Carolina — that lord Cornwallis should follow me there, and 
arrive before the defeat of lord Rawdon — m}' condition will still be bet- 
ter than it was before my late retreat, my force having been, since that 
time, considerably increased, and his lordship's much diminished. In 
addition to this, my troops are now confident in themselves, which is a 
source of great efficiency, while his are broken-spirited; the reverse of 
which was heretofore true. 

To march into South Carolina, therefore, is the true way to save 
North Carolina, to fight and beat the enemy in detail, the only mode in 
which they can be subdued, and to keep alive the spirit of freedom in 
the two southern states. 

From this movement, then, no evil can result, while much benefit 
probably will. I shall, therefore, adopt it. 


i 



evacuation or surrender of every place be attempted, 
until, having reduced the forces of the enemy to an 
equality with his own, he overthrew them in battle, 
at the Eutaw r springs, drove them for shelter within 
the lines of Charleston, and effected completely the 
reconquest of the country. 

Such, in brief, were the achievements of Greene, 
constituting a career of successes, unrivalled in the 
course of the revolutionary contest, and demonstrat- 
ing, by evidence clear and irresistible, that his ge- 
nius for war was of the highest order. 

On examining the minds of most commanders, it is 
common to find in them a marked predominancy of 
certain military qualities, giving to their characters 
a peculiar cast, and fitting them for some kinds of 
service rather than others. 

One leader is signalized by his daring courage, his 
fondness for battle, and his vehemence in attack; 
another, by great decision of character, accompanied 
by promptness of action, in every emergency; a third, 
by coolness, self-possession, and soundness of judg- 
ment; a fourth, by invincible fortitude and persever- 
ing resistance under the pressure of adversity; and 
a fifth, by a restless spirit of enterprise, seeking ad- 
venture for its own sake. 



LIFE OF GENERAL £REENE. 42 J 

Officers of these several descriptions are import- 
ant in their places, and essential to an army, on ac- 
count of their aptitudes for specific services; but they 
are totally disqualified for the highest stations. Their 
province is to receive and execute orders, not to ori- 
ginate them. 

In the military character of Greene, no such mark- 
ed predominancy existed. Too perfectly balanced 
for this, and exhibiting as much of symmetry as of 
greatness, so happily in unison were the powers of 
his mind, that no one of them preponderated at the 
expense of the others. 

It is this rare and sublime equilibrium of facul- 
ties, that forms a consummate genius for war, and 
constitutes a fitness for supreme command. Hence, 
poets and other fictitious writers of judgment, always 
bestow it on those heroes, to whom they intrust the 
direction of armies or the fate of nations. 

When Homer created his Agamemnon, to conduct 
the Greeks in the investment of Troy, and Tasso 
his Godfrey, to command in chief in the holy wars, 
each conferred on his leading hero a well balanced 
intellect. 

Had the former given the supremacy to Achilles, 
and the latter to Rinaldo, although the most bold 
and formidable warriors of their hosts, but charac- 
terised by a strong predominancy of qualities, they 
would have manifested a culpable weakness of judg- 
ment, and an entire want of military knowledge. 

Alexander of Macedon, whose master qualities 
were boldness, decision amounting to precipitancy 
and a love of enterprise, would never have achieved the 
empire of the world, had it been his fortune to con- 
tend, on equal terms, with Caesar, whose capabilities 
as a commander were greatly superior, because the 
balance of his mind was more perfect. 

Where this equilibrium does not exist, the genius 
of the leader is so far imperfect, an excess of one 
quality being always accompanied by a deficiency of 
some other. 

Such is the construction of the human intellect 
that it is scarcely possible the case can be otherwise. 
Excessive valour implies, in its definition, a want of 
prudence. Decision and promptness, carried to ex- 
cess, amount to a want of calm deliberation. Where 
prudence is the high predominating quality, the spirit 
of enterprise is frigid and feeble. And even fortitude 
and an endurance of evil, carried to an extreme, 
paralyse the functions of active courage, and become 
identified in effect with a want of energy. 

It is not intended to be here maintained, that an 
equilibrium of intellect is essential to genius of every 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 423 

description. In relation to many subjects the case 
must be reversed. 

True genius for mathematics consists in a high 
predominancy of the power of abstraction: a genius 
for poetry, in a predominancy of the power of inven- 
tion: and a genius for painting, in a predominancy of 
the imitative power. But mental irregularities like 
these, are wholly incompatible with the genius for 
war. Hence, no great commander has ever been dis- 
tinguished as a mathematician, a poet, or a painter 

Were we to attempt an analysis of the aptitudes 
and capacities of Greene, as a military chiei] we 
might show them to be composed of the following 
elements. 

Courage, of that elevated kind, which is " inflamed 
by reason, and by reason cooFd" — that courage, 
which, not only enabled him to bear undauntedly the 
shock of battle, but in opposition to public sentiment, 
and under the imputation of cowardice itself,* em- 

* Much of Greene's merit in retreating^ first from lord Cornwallis, 
through North Carolina, and afterwards from lord Kawdon, in South 
Carolina, arose from the consideration, that he did it in opposition to 
public sentiment, and even sustained, on account of it, the imputation 
of cowardice. 

For a brave officer to bear such a charge, and, still, from a devotion 
to the good of his country, persevere in the measures that have sub- 
jected him to it, requires a consummate degree of patriotism and cou- 
rage — a degree, which such commanders as Fabius, Washington, and 
Greene, alone possess. 
boldened him to retreat, when circumstances de- 
manded it, boldness in enterprise, profound judg- 
ment ripened by experience into practical skill, for- 
titude in adversity, coolness and self-possession in all 
emergencies, firmness of resolution,* promptitude of 

* Greene had been but a few weeks invested with the command of 
brigadier general, when he was appointed president of the first court- 
martial held under congress, after the commencement of the revolution- 
ary war. 

The primary object of the court, as heretofore stated, was the trial of 
certain officers on charges of misconduct in the battle of Bunker's hill. 
As yet no system of military discipline had been regularly introduced 
into the American army* The duty of strict subordination and obedience 
to command, was not only unkown, but repugnant to the very spirit 
and feeling which had induced the inhabitants of the country to resort 
to arms. Yet the public Safety called imperiously for its immediate 
enforcement. 

In this state of things, the task of Greene was arduous, and his situa- 
tion in a high degree responsible and critical. An example was to be 
set, and a standard erected for the conduct of the military, which, while 
salutary in their effect, might be attractive in their nature. At this early 
period, to do any thing so arbitrary as to disgust the people with the 
service, might be fatal to the cause for which the sword had been drawn. 
Too much severity might endanger freedom from the want of soldiers, 
and too much lenity from the want of discipline. 

To determine and maintain the proper means require^ all the wisdom 
and firmness of Greene. But he had the ability to acquit himself greatly 
to his own credit, and no less to the advautage of the service and the 
nation. In every case that was brought before him, the decision was 
acknowledged to be just; in none offensively severe. 

The court-martial, which was known to derive its chief efficiency 
from him alone, was felt, in its effects, throughout the army. It aided in 
the establishment of subordination and discipline, and was highly instru- 
mental in giving an early tone to the character of the military in gene- 
ral, which continued throughout the war, and contributed essentially to 
their safety and success. 



LIFE OF GENERAL GREENE. 425 

decision, sagacity in discovering the character of an 
enemy, and in selecting the favourable moment for 
action, vigour in attack, enlightened prudence, which 
knows when to risk and when to be cautious, a tem- 
pered obstinacy of spirit, prompting to a renewal of 
action when least expected, and an unrelaxing per- 
severance, in pursuing advantages already gained, 
until converted into an entire discomfiture of the 
foe.* 

The firmness and competency he manifested, and the standard of duty 
he set up, on this occasion, constituted one ground of his early and high 
estimation with the commander in chief. 

' This spiiit was abundantly manifested by Greene, on the occasion 
of the battle of Guilford court-house. 

When he retreated from the field, aware that lord Corwallis had sus- 
tained a heavy loss, but not supposing him crippled to such an extent as 
to be unable to pursue, he formed his line in the first advantageous po- 
sition he reached, determined again to give battle, as soon as his lordship 
should arrive. 

But the British army not appearing, led him to suspect that the blow 
he had given, was more destructive than he at first imagined. Convinced 
of this truth, in the course of the evening, by learning that the loss of 
the enemy amounted to a third of their force, he instantly resolved to 
become the assailant, and attack them in their position early in the 
morning. 

Preparations were accordingly made for the assault. But a very pro- 
fuse fall of rain occurriug in the night, rendered a stream or two that 
interposed, impassable, and thus prevented the execution of his purpose. 

But for this event, it is probable that lord Corwallis would have been 
compelled to surrender on the field of battle. 

These facts have been recently communicated to us by general 
Greene's surviving aid, who was with him, at the time, and privy to his 
intentions. 

It has been elsewhere stated, that the final escape of the enemy, on 
this occasion, was owing to Greene's being obliged to wait for supplies 

3h 
Instances, to which it would be superfluous to re- 
fer, wherein all those qualities were abundantly mani- 
fested by Greene, have been detailed in the course 
of the present work. 

If to these we add, his peculiar faculty of calling 
forth the resources of the country when existing, and 
of creating resources, in cases of deficiency, his mul- 
tifarious knowledge, his unwearied industry, and his 
powers of combination, fitting him for the entire su- 
perintendence of the concerns of an army and the 
most complicated systems of military policy, and his 
happy facility of attaching his officers to his person 
and securing their obedience, as if endowed by na- 
ture with the prerogative ,of command. — This as- 
semblage of aptitudes for the profession of arms, pre- 
sents no incorrect, although perhaps an incomplete 
picture of his genius for war, and ranks him, as he 
deserves to be, with the ablest captains of modern 
times.

I. Greeners ktter to the President of Congress^preparatonj 
to his resignation of the office of Quarter -master gene- . 
rah 

Morristoxvn, 12th Dece?nber, 1779. 
" Sir, 

" It has been my wish for a long time to relinquish the 
office of quarter-master general. This is the close of the 
second campaign, since I engaged in the duties of this of- 
fice; and I feel a degree of happiness in having it in my 
power to say with confidence, that every military operation 
whether in the main army, or in any detachment, has been 
promoted and supported, as far as it depended upon this 
department. The commander in chief has given me the 
most ample testimony of his approbation, and the success 
in every other quarter, sufficiently evinces the ample pro- 
vision that has been made. Having gone through the labo- 
rious duties of this employment successfully, two cam- 
paigns; and having engaged originally in this business, 
from necessity and not of .choice, I am desirous of return- 
ing to the line of the army, which is more grateful to my 
feelings, and consistent with my military pursuits. It has 
ever been my study, since I have been in the public ser- 
vice, to serve my country in that capacity in which I could 
be most useful, and on these occasions, I have frequently 
sacrificed my own private wishes, to the calls of public 
utility. It was well known to the congress of that day in 
which I accepted my appointment, the necessity that urged 
a compliance, and the reluctance with which I agreed to

hold the office. It was also well known to the committee of 
congress, who were delegates to negotiate this business, 
that I claimed no extraordinary emoluments, but offered 
my services on the same conditions, on which they could 
engage my colleagues. I mention those things to show, that 
I took no advantage of the public necessity, nor made the 
profits of the office, the conditions of my acceptance. I rea- 
dily confess the appointment has been somewhat flattering 
to my fortune, but in a very small proportion to what some 
people out of doors, through mistake, ignorance, or design, 
have represented. Though the perplexities incident to the 
business, are infinitely superior to the benefits accompany- 
ing it, yet I do not mean to complain, nor do I wish fur- 
ther compensation. I am not desirous of leaving the de- 
partment from a dislike to the terms of service, but from 
the employment, being injurious to my health — harassing 
to my mind, and opposed to my military pursuits. As in- 
terest was not the object which first induced me to accept 
the appointment, it would be my wish to resign it, even if 
the emoluments would be made five times as large as they 
are; provided I could retire with the approbation of con- 
gress, and without injuring the public service. These are 
the two only conditions which will determine my conduct 
in this affair; and it is on this account that I take this early 
opportunity at the close of the campaign of laying my wish- 
es before them. There are many things in holding this of- 
fice, which wound my feelings as a military man, and many 
others in the execution thereof, from the complication of 
the business, which are perplexing and vexatious; but the 
principal source of all our difficulties, is the state of our 
money — the depreciation of which locks up almost every 
species of supplies, deprives us of the opportunities of mak- 
ing contracts, or of gaining credit; and obliges us to employ 
innumerable agents to collect from the people, what they 
would be glad to furnish, were the representation of proper- 



APPENDIX. 429 

ty upon a more stable footing. Here one evil rises out of 
another: for by the great number of agents found necessary 
to procure the supplies for the army, the public expendi- 
ture is considerably increased, suitable agents more difficult 
to be got, and the whole detail of the business rendered 
mere complex, and subject to imposition. From this unfor- 
tunate circumstance great murmurings have prevailed, and 
innumerable inconveniences arisen; suspicions of want of 
economy have crept in, and distrust and jealousy have pre- 
vailed on every side. The staff officers could only conduct 
the business by such means as they were furnished with, 
and the value of these depending so much upon opinion, 
has given birth to great dissatisfaction, from the different 
estimations which have prevailed at different times, and in 
different places. The losses sustained by those individuals 
and districts, which have been the most forward to supply 
the public on credit, and in the greatest plenty, have taught 
others to be more wary; and this disposition has now grown 
to a most formidable height, not only among individuals, 
but in towns, counties, and even among most of the states; 
in ail of which such a spirit of competition prevails for the 
benefit of their own inhabitants, as is alarming to behold, as 
well as destructive to the public interest; and wherever the 
law of any state obliges the people to part with their pro- 
perty, for the use of the army, the magistrates will not put 
it in execution, unless the public agents are possessed of 
money to pay for the same. Had the currency any perma- 
nent footing, or fixed value, such are the characters of 
many of the public agents, that large supplies might be had 
upon their credit; but the unsettled state of the money, and 
the sufferings' of those who have sold upon credit hereto- 
fore, as well as the heavy demands now against the depart- 
ment, leave us nothing further to hope from this source. In 
this distressing situation, without money and without cre- 
dit, necessity obliges me to give congress this information, 



430 APPENDIX. 

and to ask their advice what we are to do? Here is an ex- 
pensive army to support, and the difficulties hourly in- 
creasing, besides the preparations necessary for another 
campaign fast approaching, while we are without the 
means either to defray the current expenses, or discharge 
our past contracts, which are now very great, owing to the 
poverty of the treasury for some months past; and so dis- 
satisfied are the people at being kept out of their money, 
that they have begun to sue the public agents — the conse- 
quence of which will be, an accumulated expense to the de- 
partment, as well as a total loss of confidence in the public 
officers. So strict are the laws of some states, and so at- 
tentive are the magistrates to guard the people's property, 
that the forage officers have been prosecuted, and heavily 
fined, for presuming to take forage on the march of the 
army, to save the public cattle from starving, by virtue of a 
press-warrant, granted by the commander in chief. Nothing 
can be more alarming than the situation of the forage -de- 
partment at this time. The magazines empty, the consump- 
tion very large, and will be greatly increased from the in- 
terior position in which the commander in chief has ordered 
the army to be placed in for its greater security. 

I should have written to congress long before, of the ap- 
proaching distress which I had reason to tear, from the 
scanty supplies of money; but I have been in constant ex- 
pectation that things would change for the better, and I 
have been so much engaged for this month or six weeks 
past, in making preparation for the intended New York 
expedition, and in searching out a position for hutting the 
army, that I have had neither time or opportunity — Be- 
sides, Mr. Pettit's representations on this head have been 
so full, that he has left me little or nothing to say. Such 
is the state of the army, both with respect to provisions 
and forage at this time, from the scanty supplies of cash, 
that I dare not say what I think I have great reason to 



APPENDIX. 431 

fear; and such has been the difficulty of supporting the 
army through the whole of the campaign, that had it not 
been for the taxes in some states, and the expectations of 
them in others, it had been utterly impossible to have done 
it. 

The earlier congress shall make choice of a person to 
fill my place, the better; as a new arrangement is absolute- 
ly necessary to be made for the staff on salary; which if 
not speedily attended to will leave the department without 
a single agent (except those on commission) necessary to 
the business; indeed, so great has been their disgust and 
distress, that it has been with the utmost difficulty and per- 
suasion, that they could be prevailed on to stay for this 
six months past — and nothing but personal influence and 
the fullest assurance that a more ample provision would be 
made for their support at the close of the campaign, has 
kept them in service. This is a matter of such importance, 
and the consequences of a delay so much to be dreaded, 
that I trust it will obtain the earliest notice. I shall be 
happy to give every information in this, and all other^regu- 
lations, (which are not a few) that shall be found necessary 
for the due government of this department.

II. General Greeners official report of the battle of Guil- 
ford, to the president of congress. 

Camp at the Iron Works, March 16, 1781. 
" Sir, 

" On the 10th, I wrote to his excellency general Wash- 
ington, from the High Rock ford, on the Haw river, a copy 
of which I enclosed your excellency, that I had effected a 
junction with a continental regiment of eighteen months 
men, and two considerable bodies of militia, belonging to 
Virginia and North Carolina. After this junction, I took 
the resolution of attacking the enemy without loss of time, 
and made the necessary disposition accordingly, being per- 
suaded, that if we were successful, it would prove ruinous 
to the enemy, and, if otherwise, it would only prove a par- 
tial evil to us. 

" The army marched from the High Rock ford on the . 
12th, and on the 14th, arrived at Guilford. The enemy lay 
at the Quaker meeting-house, on Deep River, eight miles 
from our camp. On the morning of the 15th, our recon- 
noitring party reported the enemy advancing on the great 
Salisbury road. The army was drawn up in three lines. 
The line was composed of North Carolina militia, under 
the command of generals Butler and Eaton. The second 
line of Virginia militia, commanded by generals Stephens 
and Lawson, forming two brigades, one of Virginia, and 
one of Maryland continental troops, commanded by gene- 
ral Huger and colonel Williams. Lieutenant colonel Wash- 
ington, with the dragoons of the first and third regiments* 
a detachment of light infantry, composed of continental 
troops, and a regiment of riflemen, under colonel Lynch, 
formed a corps of observation for the security of our right 
flank. Lieutenant colonel Lee, with his legion, a detach- 
ment of light infantry, and a corps of riflemen, under colo- 



APPENDIX. 433 

nel Campbell, formed a corps of observation for the securi- 
ty of our left flank. 

u The greater part of this country is a wilderness, with a 
few cleared fields interspersed here and there. The army 
was drawn up on a large hill of ground, surrounded by 
other hills, the greatest part of which was covered with 
timl'er and thick under-brush. The front line was posted 
with two field pieces, just on the edge of the woods, and 
the back of a fence which ran parallel with the line, with 
an open field directly in their front. The second line was 
in the woods, about three hundred yards in the rear of the 
first, and the continental troops about four hundred yards 
in the rear of the second, with a double front, as the hill 
drew to a point where they were posted j and on the right 
and left were two old fields. In this position we waited the 
approach of the enemy, having previously sent off the bag- 
gage to this place, appointed for our rendezvous in case of 
a deft at. Lieutenant, colonel Lee, with his legion, his in- 
fantry, and part of his riflemen, met the enemy on their ad- 
vance, and had a severe skirmish with lieutenant colonel 
Tarleton, in which the enemy suffered greatly. Captain 
Armstrong charged the British legion, and cut down near 
thirty 'of their dragoons; but as the enemy reinforced their 
part}', lieutenant colonel Lee was obliged to retire, and 
take 1 lis position in the line. 

u The action commenced bv cannonade, which lasted 
about twenty minutes; when the enemy advanced in three 
columns: the Hessians on the right, the guards in the centre, 
and lieutenant colonel Webster's brigade on the left. The 
whole moved through the old fields to attack the North 
Carolina brigades, who waited the attack until the entmy 
got within one hundred and forty yards, when part of them 
began to fire; but a considerable part left the ground with- 
out firing at all. The general and field officers did all they 
could to induce the men to stand their ground; but neither 

3 i 



434 APPENDIX. 

the advantages of the position, nor any other consideration 
could induce them to stay. General Stevens and general 
Lawson and the field officers of those brigades were more 
successful in their exertions. The Virginia militia gave 
the enemy a warm reception, and kept up a heavy fire for 
a long time; but being beat back, the action became gene- 
ral almost every where. The corps of observation, under 
Washington and Lee, were warmly engaged, and did 
great execution. In a word, the engagement was long and 
severe, and the enemy only gained their point by superior 
discipline. 

" They having broken the second Maryland regiment 
and turned our left flank, got into the rear of the Virginia 
brigade, and appearing to be gaining on our right, which 
wouid have encircled the whole of the continental troops, 
I thought it most advisable to order a retreat. About this 
time lieutenant colonel Washington made a charge with 
the horse upon a part of the brigade of guards, and the 
first regiment of Marylanders, commanded by colonel Gun- 
by, and seconded by lieutenant colonel Howard, followed 
the horse with their bayonets; near the whole of the party 
fell a sacrifice. General Huger was the last that was en- 
gaged, and gave the enemy a check. We retreated in good 
order to the Reedy Fork river; and crossed at the ford, 
about three miies from the field of action, and then halted, 
and drew up the troops, until we collected most of the 
stragglers. We lost our artillery, and two ammunition 
wagons, the greater part of the horses being killed before 
the retreat began, and it being impossible to move the pie- 
ces but along the great road. After collecting our strag- 
glers, we retired to this camp, ten miles distant from Guil- 
ford. 

" From the best information I can get, the enemy's loss 
is very great; not less, in killed and wounded, than six 



APPENDIX. 435 

hundred men, besides some few prisoners that we 
brought off. 

" Inclosed I send your excellency a return of our killed, 
wounded and missing. Most of the latter have gone 
home, as is but too customary with the militia after an 
action. I cannot learn that the enemy has got any consi- 
derable number of prisoners. Our men are all in good 
spirits, and in perfect readiness for another field day. 

" I only lament the loss of several valuable officers, who 
are killed and wounded in the action. Among the latter 
are general Stephens, shot through the thigh, and general 
Huger in the hand; and among the former is major An- 
derson, one of the Marvland line. 

" The firmness of the officers and soldiers, during the 
whole campaign, has been unparalleled. Amidst innume- 
rable difficulties, they have discovered a degree of mag- 
nanimity and fortitude that will for ever add a lustre to 
their military reputation."

III. Battle of HobkirVs Hill. 

Sir, 

w I had the honour to write to your excellency the 2d in- 
stant, April, to inform you that we were encamped be- 
fore Camden, having found it impossible to attempt to 
storm the town with any hopes of success; and having no 
other alternative, but to take such a position as should 
induce the enemy to sally from their works. To this end, 
we posted ourselves on an eminence about a mile from the 
town, near the high road leading to Wacsaws: It was co- 
vered with woods, and flanked on the left by an impassable 
swamp. The ground between this place and the town is 



436 APPENDIX. 

covered by a thick wood and shrubbery. In this situation 
we remained constantly on the watch, and ready for action 
at a moment's warning. 

" On the morning of the 25th, about eleven o'clock our 
advanced pickets received the first fire from the enemy, 
and returned it warmly. The line was formed in an in- 
stant. General Huger's brigade to the right; colonel Wil- 
liam's Maryland brigade to the left; the artillery in the 
centre; colonel Read, with some militia, formed a kind of 
second line; captain Kirkwood, with the light infantry, was 
posted in our front, and when the enemy advanced, he 
was soon engaged with them, and both he and his men 
behaved with a great deal of bravery; nor did the pickets 
under captains Morgan and Benson act with less courage 
or regularity. Observing that the enemy advanced with 
but few men abreast, I ordered lieutenant colonel Ford, 
with the 2d Maryland regiment, to flank them on the left, 
while lieutenant colonel Campbell was to do the same on 
the right. Colonel Gunby, with the 1st Maryland regi- 
ment, and lieutenant colonel Hawes, with the 2d Virginia 
regiment, received orders at the same time to descend 
from the eminence, and attack in front; and I sent lieu- 
tenant colonel Washington at the same time to double the 
right flank, and attack the rear of the enemy. The whole 
line was soon in action in the midst of a very smart fire, 
as well from our small arms as from our artillery, which, 
under the command of colonel Harrison, kept playing upon 
the front of the enemy, who began to give way on all sides, 
and their left absolutely to retreat; when, unfortunately, 
two companies on the right of the 1st Maryland regiment 
were entirely thrown into disorder; and, by another stroke 
of fortune, colonel Gunby ordered the rest of the regi- 
ment, which was advancing, to take a new position to- 
wards the rear, where the two companies were rallying. 
This movement gave the whole regiment an idea of a re- 



APPENDIX. 437 

treat, which soon spread through the 2d regiment, which 
reir. t cc rdingly; they both rallied afterwards; but it 

was too late; the enemy had gained the eminence, silenced 
the artillery, and obliged us to draw it off. The 2d Vir- 
ginia regiment having descended the eminence a little, 
and having its left flank naked by the retreat of the Mary- 
landers, the enemy immediately doubled upon them, and 
attacked them both on the flank and in front. Colonel 
Campbell's regiment was thrown into confusion, and had 
retreated a little; I therefore thought it necessary for colo- 
nel Hawes to retreat also. The troops rallied more than 
once; but the disorder was too general, and had struck too 
deep for one to think of recovering the fortune of the day, 
which promised us at the onset the most complete victory; 
for colonel Washington, on his way to double and attack 
in the rear, found the enemy, both horse and foot, retreat- 
ing with precipitation towards the town, and made up- 
wards of two hundred of them prisoners, together with 
ten or fifteen officers, before he perceived that our troops 
had abandoned the field of battle. The colonel, upon this 
occasion, and indeed his whole corps, acquired no incon- 
siderable share of honour. We then retreated two or 
three miles from the scene of action, without any loss of 
artillery, wagons, or provisions, having taken the precau- 
tion to send away our baggage at the beginning of the ac- 
tion. The enemy have suffered very considerably; our 
forces were nearly equal in number; but such were the 
dispositions that I had made, that, if we had succeeded, 
the whole of the enemy's army must have fallen into our 
hands, as well as the town of. Camden. I herewith enclose 
a list of the killed and wounded; among the first is captain 
Beatry, of the Maryland line, one of the best of officers, 
and an ornament to his profession. Our army is full of 
spirits; and this little check will not by any means derange 
or alter our general plan of operations.

" P. S. The cavalry and a part of the infantry charged 
the enemy in the dusk of the evening, and made them fly 
with precipitation into the town." 



IV. The Assault of Ninety Six. 



u 



In my last letter of the 9th, I informed your excel- 
lency, that the enemy had received a considerable rein- 
forcement at Charlestown, and that I was apprehensive 
they would march and interrupt our operations. On the 
11th I got intelligence they were advancing; I immedi- 
ately advanced all the cavalry, with orders to general 
Sumpter to collect all the force he could, and keep in their 
front, and by every means in his power to retard their 
march. The enemy passed him at Congaree before he 
got his troops in motion; afterwards he found it impracta- 
ble to gain their front. It was my intention to have fought 
them before they arrived at Ninety six, could I have col- 
lected a force sufficient for the purpose. 

" We had pushed on our approaches very near to the 
enemy's work; our third parallel was formed round their 
abbatis; a mine and two approaches were within a few feet 
of the ditch. These approaches were directed against the 
Star fort, which stands upon the left of the town as we ap- 
proached it from the Saluda. On our right our approaches 
were very near the enemy's redoubts: this was a strong 
stockade fort, with two block houses in it. These two 



APPENDIX. 439 

works flanked the town, which is picketed in with strong 
pickets, a ditch round the whole, and a bank raised near 
the height of \ common parapet. Besides these fortifica- 
tions, were several little Heches in different parts of the 
town; and all the works communicated with each other by 
covered ways. We had raised several batteries for can- 
non; one upwards of twenty feet high, within one hundred 
and forty yards of the Star fort, to command the works, 
and a rifle battery also within thirty yards, to prevent the 
enemy from annoying our workmen. For the last ten 
days not a man could show his head but he was immedi- 
ately shot down; and the firing was almost incessant day 
and night. In this state of the approaches, I found the 
enemy so near us, that it would be impossible to reduce 
the place without hazarding a storm. This, from the pe- 
culiar strength of the place, could only be warranted by 
the success of a partial attempt to make a lodgement on 
one of the curtains of the Star redoubt, and a vigorous 
push to carry the right-hand work. 

" The disposition was accordingly formed, and the at- 
tack made; lieutenant colonel Lee, with his legion infantry, 
and captain Kirkwood's light infantry, made the attack on 
the right; and lieutenant colonel Campbell, with the 1st 
Maryland and the 1st Virginia regiments, was to have 
stormed the Star redoubt, which is their principal work, 
and stands upon the left; the parapet of this work is near 
twelve feet high, and raised with sand bags near three 
feet more. Lieutenant Duvall, of the Maryland line, and 
lieutenant Selden, of the Virginia line, led on the forlorn 
hope, followed by a party with hooks to pull down the 
sand bags, the better to enable them to make the lodge- 
ment. A furious cannonade preluded the attack. On the 
right the enemy were driven out of their works, and our 
people took possession: on the left, never was greater bra- 
very exhibited than by the parties led on by Duvall and 



440 APPENDIX. 

Seldon; but they were not so successful. They entered 
the enemy's ditch, and made every exertion to get down 
the sand bags, which, from the depth of the ditch, height 
of the parapet, and under a galling fire, was rendered dif- 
ficult. Finding the enemy defended their works with 
great obstinacy, and seeing but little prospect of succeed- 
ing without heavy loss, I ordered the attack to be pushed 
no further. 

" The behaviour of the troops on this occasion deserves 
the highest commendations; both the officers that entered 
the ditch were wounded, and the greater part of their men 
were either killed or wounded. I have only to lament 
that such brave men fell in an unsuccessful attempt. 

" Captain Armstrong, of the 1st Maryland regiment, 
was killed, and captain Benson, who commanded the regi- 
ment, was wounded at the head of the trenches. In both 
attacks we had upwards of forty men killed and wounded; 
the loss was principally at the Star fort and in the enemy's 
ditch, the other parties being all under cover. The attack 
was continued three quarters of an hour, and as the enemy 
were greatly exposed to the fire of the rifle battery and 
artillery; they must have suffered greatly. Our artillery 
was well served, and I believe did great execution. 

" The troops have undergone incredible hardships dur- 
ing the siege; and though the issue was not successful, I 
hope their exertions will merit the approbation of con- 
gress. 

" We continued the siege until the enemy got within a 
few miles of us, having previously sent off all our sick, 
wounded, and spare stores. 

Nath. Greene."

V, Head-quarters, Martin's Tavern, near Fergusons 
Swamp, South Carolina, September 11th, 1781. 
"Sir, 

" In my last despatch of the 25th of August I informed 
your excellency that we were on our march for Fryday's 
ferry, to form a junction with the state troops, and a body 
of militia, collecting at that place, with an intention to make 
an attack upon the British army laying at colonel Thomp- 
son's, near M'Cord's ferry. On the 27th, on our arrival 
near Fryday's ferry, I got intelligence that the enemy were 
retiring. 

" We crossed the river at Howell's ferry, and took post at 
Motte's plantation. Here I got intelligence that the enemy 
had halted at the Eutaw Springs, about forty miles below 
us; and that they had a reinforcement, and were making 
preparations to establish a permanent post there. To pre- 
vent this, I was determined rather to hazard an action, 
notwithstanding our numbers were greatly inferior to theirs. 
On the 5th, we began our march, our baggage and stores 
having been ordered to Howell's ferry under a proper 
guard. We moved by slow and easy marches, as well to 
disguise our real intention, as to give general Marion an 
opportunity to join us, who had been detached for the sup- 
port of colonel Harden, a report of which I transmitted in 
my letter of the 5th, dated Maybrick's creek. General 
Marion joined us on the evening of the 7th, at Burdell's 
plantation, seven miles from the enemy's camp. 

" We made the following disposition, and marched at 
four o'clock the next morning to attack the enemy. Our 
front line was composed of four small battalions of militia, 
two of North and two of South Carolinians; one oi the 
South Carolinians was under the immediate command of 
general Marion, and was posted on the right, who also 
commanded the front line: the two North Carolina bat- 
talions, under the command of colonel Malmady, were 

3 K 



442 APPENDIX. 

4 

posted in the centre; and the other South Carolina bat- 
talion, under the command of general Pickens, was posted 
on the left. Our second line consisted of three small bri- 
gades of continental troops, — one from North Carolina, 
one from Virginia, and one from Maryland. The North 
Carolinians were formed into three battalions, under the 
command of lieutenant colonel Ash, majors Armstrong 
and Blount; the whole commanded by general Sumner, 
and posted upon the right. The Virginians consisted of 
two battalions, commanded by major Snead and captain 
Edmonds, and the whole by lieutenant colonel Campbell, 
and posted in the centre. The Marylanders also consisted 
of two battalions, commanded by lieutenant colonel How- 
ard and major Hardman, and the brigade by colonel Wil- 
liams, deputy adjutant general to the army, and were 
posted upon the left. Lieutenant colonel Lee with his 
legion covered our right flank; and lieutenant colonel Hen- 
derson with the state troops, commanded by lieutenant 
colonels Hampton, Middleton, and Polk, our left. Lieu- 
tenant colonel Washington with his horse, and the Dela- 
ware troops under captain Kirkwood, formed a corps de 
reserve. Two three pounders under captain lieutenant 
Gaines advanced with the front line, and two sixes under 
captain Browne with the second. 

" The legion and state troops formed our advance, and 
were to retire upon the flanks upon the enemy's forming. 
Ir this order we moved on to the attack. The legion and 
state troops fell in with a party of the enemy's horse and 
foot, about four miles from their camp, who, mistaking 
our people for a party of militia, charged them briskly, 
but were soon convinced of their mistake by the reception 
they met with. The infantry of the state droops kept up 
a heavy fire, and the legion in front, under captain Ru- 
dolph, charged them with fixed bayonets: they fled on all 
sides, leaving four or five dead on the ground, and several 



APPENDIX. 442 

more wounded. As this was supposed to be the advance 
of the British army, our front line was ordered to form 
and move on briskly in line, the legion and state troops to 
take their position upon the flanks. All the country is co- 
vered with timber from the place the action began to the 
Eutaw Springs. The firing began again between two and 
three miles from the British camp. The militia were 
ordered to keep advancing as they fired. The enemy's 
advanced parties were soon driven in, and a most tremen- 
dous fire began on both sides from right to left, and the 
legion and state troops were closely engaged. General 
Marion, colonel Malmady and general Pickens conducted 
the troops with great gallantry and good conduct; and the 
militia fought with a degree of spirit and firmness that 
reflects the highest honour upon that class of soldiers. 
But the enemy's fire being greatly superior to ours, and 
continuing to advance, the militia began to give ground. 
The North Carolina brigade, under general Sumner, was 
ordered up to their support. These were all new levies, 
and had been under discipline but little more than a 
month; notwithstanding which they fought with a degree 
of obstinacy that would do honour to the best of veterans; 
and I could hardly tell which to admire most, the gal- 
lantry of the officers or the bravery of the troops. They 
kept up a heavy and well directed fire, and the enemy 
returned it with equal spirit, for they really fought worthy 
of a better cause, and great execution was done on both 
sides. In this stage of the action, the Virginians under 
lieutenant colonel Campbell, and the Marylanders under 
colonel Williams, were led on to a brisk charge, with 
trailed arms, through a heavy cannonade and a shower of 
musket balls. Nothing could exceed the gallantry and 
firmness of both officers and soldiers upon this occasion. 
They preserved their order, and pressed on with such un- 
shaken resolution that they bore down all before them. 



444 APPENDIX. 

The enemy were routed in all quarters. Lieutenant colo- 
nel Lee had, with great address, gallantry, and good con- 
duct, turned the enemy's left flank, and was charging 
them in rear at the same time the Virginia and Maryland 
troops were charging them in front. A most valuable offi- 
cer, lieutenant colonel Henderson, got wounded early in 
the action, and lieutenant colonel Hampton, who com- 
manded the state cavalry, and who fortunately succeeded 
lieutenant colonel Henderson in command, charged a party 
of the enemy, and took upwards of one hundred prisoners. 
Lieutenant colonel Washington brought up the corps de 
reserve upon the left, where the enemy seemed disposed 
to make further resistance; and charged them so briskly 
with the cavalry and captain Kirkwood's infantry, as gave 
them no time to rally or form. Lieutenant colonels Polk 
and Middleton, who commanded the state infantry, were 
no less conspicuous for their good conduct than therr in- 
trepidity; and the troops under their command gave a 
specimen of what may be expected from men, naturally 
brave, when improved by proper discipline. Captain 
lieutenant Gaines, who commanded the three pounders 
with the front line, did great execution until his pieces 
were dismounted. We kept close at the enemy's heels 
after they broke, until we got into their camp, and a great 
number of prisoners were continually falling into our 
hands, and some hundreds of the fugitives ran off towards 
Charleston. But a party threw themselves into a large 
three story brick house, which stands near the spring; 
others took post in a picqueted garden, while others were 
lodged in an impenetrable thicket, consisting of a cragged 
shrub, called a black jack. Thus secured in front, and 
upon the right by the house and a deep ravine, upon the 
left by the picqueted garden and in the impenetrable shrubs, 
and the rear also being secured by the springs and deep 
hollow ways, the enemy renewed the action. Every ex-

ertion was made to dislodge them. Lieutenant colonel 
Washington made most astonishing efforts to get through 
the thicket to charge the enemy in the rear; but found it 
impracticable, had his horse shot under him, and was 
wounded and taken prisoner. Four six pounders were 
ordered up before the house — two of our own, and two of 
the enemy's, which they had abandoned — and they were 
pushed on so much under the command of the fire from 
the house and the party in the thicket, as rendered it im- 
practicable to bring them off again when the troops were 
ordered to retire. Never were pieces better served; most 
of the men and officers were either killed or wounded. 
Washington failing in his charge upon the left, and the 
legion baffled in an attempt upon the right, and finding 
our infantry galled by the fire of the enemy, and our am- 
munition mostly consumed, though both officers and men 
continued to exhibit uncommon acts of heroism, I thought 
proper to retire out of the fire of the house, and draw up 
the troops at a little distance in the woods; not thinking it 
advisable to push our advantages further, being persuaded 
the enemy could not hold the post many hours, and that 
our chance to attack them on the retreat was better than a 
second attempt to dislodge them, in which, if we suc- 
ceeded, it must be attended with considerable loss. 

" We collected all our wounded, except such as were 
under the command of the fire of the house, and retired 
to the ground, from which we marched in the morning, 
there being no water nearer, and the troops ready to faint 
with the heat, and want of refreshment, the action having 
continued near four hours. I left on the field of action a 
strong picquet, and early in the morning detached general 
Marion and lieutenant colonel Lee with the legion horse 
between Eutaw and Charleston, to prevent any reinforce- 
ments from coming to the relief of the enemy; and also to 
retard their march, should they attempt to retire, and give 



446 APPENDIX. 

time to the army to fall upon their rear and put a finishing 
stroke to our successes. We left two pieces of our artil- 
lery in the hands of the enemy, and brought off one of 
theirs. On the evening of the 9th, the enemy retired, 
leaving upwards of seventy of their wounded behind them, 
and not less than one thousand stand of arms that were 
picked up on the field, and found broke and concealed in 
the Eutaw Springs. They stove between twenty and 
thirty puncheons of rum, and destroyed a great variety of 
other stores, which they had not carriages to carry off. 
We pursued them the moment we got intelligence of their 
retiring. But they formed a junction with major M' Ar- 
thur at this place, general Marion and lieutenant colonel 
Lee not having a force sufficient to prevent it: but on our 
approach they retired to the neighbourhood of Charleston. 
We have taken five hundred prisoners, including the 
wounded the enemy left behind; and I think they cannot 
have suffered less than six hundred more in killed and 
wounded. The fugitives that fled from the field of battle 
spread such an alarm that the enemy burnt their stores at 
Dorchester, and abandoned the post at Fair Lawn; and a 
great number of negroes and others were employed in 
felling trees across the road for some miles without the 
gates of Charleston. Nothing but the brick house, and 
the peculiar strength of the position at Eutaw, saved the 
remains of the British army from being all made prisoners. 
u We pursued them as far as this place; but not being 
able to overtake them, we shall halt a day or two to re- 
fresh, and then take our old position on the High Hills of 
Santee. I think myself principally indebted for the vic- 
tory we obtained to the free use of the bayonet made by 
the Virginians and Marylanders, the infantry of the legion, 
and captain Kirkwood's light infantry: and though few 
armies ever exhibited equal bravery with ours in general, 
yet the conduct and intrepidity of these corps were pecu-

liarly conspicuous. Lieutenant colonel Campbell fell as 
he was leading his troops to the charge, and though he 
fell with distinguished marks of honour, yet his loss is 
much to be regretted: he was the great soldier and the 
firm patriot. 

" Our loss in officers is considerable, more from their va- 
lue than their number; for never did either men or officers 
offer their blood more willingly in the service of their 
country. I cannot help acknowledging my obligations to 
colonel Williams for his great activity on this and many 
other occasions in forming the army, and for his uncom- 
mon intrepidity in leading on the Maryland troops to the 
charge, which exceeded any thing I ever saw. I also feel 
myself greatly indebted to captains Pierce and Pendleton, 
major Hyrne and captain Shubrick, my aids-de-camp, for 
their activity and good conduct throughout the whole of 
the action. 

" This despatch will be handed to your excellency by 
captain Pierce, to whom I beg leave to refer you for fur- 
ther particulars. 

" I have the honour to, &c.

VI. Mecklenburgh Declaration of Independence. 

The present work purporting to develop somewhat of 
the spirit and character of the people of the south, during 
the war of the revolution, the publication of the following 
curious and interesting document is so far relevant to its 
design. 

On the authenticity of the article, it is believed that a 
perfect reliance may be placed. 

With the chairman and secretary {clerk , as the latter is 
there denominated) as well as with colonel Thomas Polk, a 



448 APPENDIX. 

very spirited and leading member of the association, the 
writer of these Memoirs was intimately acquainted; and 
knows them to have been capable, of all that is virtuous, 
patriotic, and daring. 

Their proceedings clearly show, that while Virginia and 
Massachusetts are contending for the honour. of having 
given birth to the revolutionary spirit of our country, the 
state of North Carolina took the lead of both, in a formal 
manifestation of the spirit oj independence. 

We need not indicate to the reader the identity of the 
language, which closes the third resolution of the Meck- 
lenburg declaration, with that closing the last section of 
our national declaration, which was prepared and adopted 
more than a year afterwards. 

North Carolina, Mecklenburgh County, 

May 20th, 1775. 

, " In the spring of 1775, the leading characters of Meck- 
lenburgh county, stimulated by the enthusiastic patriotism 
which elevates the mind above considerations of individual 
aggrandisement, and scorning to shelter themselves from 
the impending storm, by submission to lawless power, &c. 
&c. held several detached meetings, in each of which the 
individual sentiments were " that the cause of Boston was 
the cause of all; that their destinies were indissolubly con- 
nected with those of their eastern fellow-citizens — and 
that they must either submit to all the impositions which 
an unprincipled, and to them an unrepresented parliament 
might impose — or support their brethren who were doomed 
to sustain the first shock of that power, which, if success- 
ful there, would ultimately overwhelm all in the common 
calamity. Comformably to these principles, colonel Adam 
Alexander, through solicitation, issued an order to each 
captain's company in the county of Mecklenburgh (then 
comprising the present county of Cabarrus) directing each 



APPENDIX. 449 

militia company to elect two persons, and delegate to them 
ample power to devise ways and means to aid and assist 
their suffering brethren in Boston, and also generally to 
adopt measures to extricate themselves from the impend- 
ing storm, and to secure, unimpaired, their inalienable 
rights, privileges and liberties from the dominant grasp of 
British imposition and tyranny. 

" In conforming to said order, on the 19th of May, 
1775, the said delegation met in Charlotte, vested with 
unlimited powers; at which time official news, by express, 
arrived of the battle of Lexington on that day of the pre- 
ceding month. Every delegate felt the value and impor- 
tance of the prize, and the awful and solemn crisis which 
had arrived— every bosom swelled with indignation at the 
malice, inveteracy, and insatiable revenge developed in 
the late attack at Lexington. The universal sentiment 
was — let us not flatter ourselves that popular harangues — 
or resolves; that popular vapour will avert the storm, or 
vanquish our common enemy — let us deliberate — let us 
calculate the issue — the probable result; and then let us 
act with energy as brethren leagued to preserve our pro- 
perty — our lives, — and what is still more endearing, the 
liberties of America. — Abraham Alexander was then elect- 
ed chairman, and John M^Knitt Alexander, clerk. After 
a free and full discussion of the various objects for which 
the delegation had been convened, it was unanimously 
ordained — 

" 1. Resolved, That whosoever directly or indirectly abet- 
ted, or in any way, form, or manner, countenanced the 
unchartered and dangerous invasion of our rights, as claim- 
ed by Great Britain, is an enemy to his country — to 
America — and to the inherent and unalienable rights of 
man. 

" 2. Resolved, That we, the citizens of Mecklenburgh 

county, do hereby dissolve the political bands which have 

3 l 



450 APPENDIX. 

connected us to the mother country, and hereby dissolve 
ourselves from all allegiance to the British crown, and 
abjure all political connexion, contract, or association with 
that nation, who have wantonly trampled on our rights 
and liberties — and inhumanly shed the innocent blood of 
American patriots at Lexington. 

ct 3. Resolved, That we do hereby declare ourselves a 
free and independent people; are, and of right ought to be, 
a sovereign and self governing association, under the con- 
troul of no power other than that of our God and the ge- 
neral government of the congress: to the maintenance of 
which independence, we solemnly pledge to each other Our 
mutual co-operation, our lives, our fortunes, and our most 
sacred honour. 

"4. Resolved, That, as we now acknowledge the existence 
and controul of no law or legal officer, civil or military; 
within this county, we do hereby ordain and adopt, as a 
rule of life, all, each, and every of our former laws — 
wherein, nevertheless, the crown of Great Britain never 
can be considered as holding rights, privileges, immuni- 
ties, or authority therein. 

u 5. Resolved, That it is also further decreed, that all, 
each, and every military officer in this county is hereby 
reinstated to his former command and authority, he act- 
ing conformably to these regulations. And that every 
member present of this delegation shall henceforth be a 
civil officer, viz. a justice of the peace, in the character of 
a c committee man,' to issue process, hear and determine 
all matters of controversy, according to said adopted laws, 
and to preserve peace and union, and harmony, in said 
county; and to use every exertion to spread the love of 
country and fire of freedom throughout America, until a 
more general and organized government be established in 
this province. 



APPENDIX. 451 

u A number of by-laws were also added, merely to pro- 
tect the association from confusion and to regulate their 
general conduct as citizens. After sitting in the court- 
house all night, neither sleepy, hungry, nor fatigued, and 
after discussing every paragraph, they were all passed, 
sanctioned, and decreed unanimously, about two o'clock, 
A. M. May 20. In a few days, a deputation of said de- 
legation convened, when captain James Jack, of Char- 
lotte, was deputed as express to the congress at Philadel- 
phia, with a copy of said resolves and proceedings, toge- 
ther with a letter addressed to our three representatives, 
viz. Richard Caswell, William Hooper, and Joseph Hughes, 
under express injunction, personally, and through the state 
representation, to use all possible means to have said pro- 
ceedings sanctioned and approved by the general congress. 
On the return of captain Jack, the delegation learned that 
their proceedings were individually approved by the mem- 
bers of congress, but that it was deemed premature to lay 
them before the house. A joint letter from said three 
members of congress was also received, complimentary of 
the zeal in the common cause, and recommending perse- 
verance, order, and energy. 

" The subsequent harmony, unanimity, and exertion, in 
the cause of liberty and independence, evidently resulting 
from these regulations, and the continued exertion of said 
delegation, apparently tranquilized this section of the state, 
and met with the concurrence and high approbation of the 
council of safety, who held their sessions at Newbern and 
Wilmington, alternately, and who confirmed the nomina- 
tion and acts of the delegation in their official capacity. 

u From this delegation originated the court of inquiry 
of this county, who constituted and held their first session 
in Charlotte; they then held their meetings regularly at 
Charlotte, at colonel James Harris's, and at colonel Phi- 
fer's, alternately, one week at each place. It was a civil 



452 



APPENDIX. 



court founded on military process. Before this judica- 
ture all suspicious persons were made to appear, who were 
formally tried, and banished or continued under guard. 
Its jurisdiction was as unlimited as toryism, and its de- 
crees as final as the confidence and patriotism of the 
county. Several were arrested and brought before them 
from Lincoln, Rowan, and the adjacent counties. 

" [The foregoing is a true copy of the papers on the 
above subject, left in my hands by John Matthew Alex- 
ander, deceased. I find it mentioned on file that the ori- 
ginal book was burned in April, 1800; that a copy of the 
procedings was sent to Hugh Williamson, in New York, 
then writing a history of North Carolina, and that a copy 

was sent to general W. R. Davies.
