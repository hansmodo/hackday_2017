 The Duke Charles writes : 

" My Dear Colonel Riedesel : 

" I send you herewith a commission, which, however, you are 
not to produce until you have finished the first march with the 
first division. I also send you instructions in German and 
French, together with the directions which each regimental 
commander will likewise receive. You will make yourself 
thoroughly acquainted with all of them, and see that they are 
strictly and accurately enforced. I depend solely upon you for 
this, always remaining 

" Your affectionate 

" CHARLES, DUKE OF BRUNSWICK. 
" Brunswick, January 20, 1776. 

" To Colonel Yon Riedesel at Wulfenbiittel." 

Before the inarch there was granted to the officers two months 
extra pay for their equipment. 



AV r THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 27 

The form of the oath as prescribed in the treaty was as fol 
lows : 

" You hereby promise and make oath to God upon his holy 
word, that, in consequence of a subsidiary treaty made between 
the most excellent, high and mighty prince and lord, George 
ITT, by the grace of God, king of Great Britain, of the first part, 
and his excellency, the prince and lord, Charles, by the grace of 
God, duke of Brunswick Liineburg, of the second part, you will 
give this [the amount of money here inserted] to his highness, the royal majesty, in service from this day. You farther 
promise, on all occasions, to obey orders as it becomes and be 
hooves brave and honest soldiers, with the exception of those 
obligations, whereby you are already bound to the service of 
his highness the duke, our most gracious Lord in everything 
faithful and without deceit. So help you God." 

These treaties were made with the utmost haste ; for England 
had no time to lose if she would quell the rapidly growing rebel 
lion in her colonies. And, indeed, with all the expedition that 
could be made, and under the most favorable circumstances, six 
months must elapse before she could land her troops on the 
American coast. In the garrison cities of Brunswick unusual 
activity now prevailed so many preparations had to be made 
for the long journey. 

Amid, however, the thousand and one details of business 
demanded by the service, Riedesel was mindful both of his own 
future and that of those who belonged to him by the ties of 
kindred. In a will which he made, he gave directions in relation to the disposition of his property and the welfare of his 
family in case of his death. Previous to this, he asked the con 
sent of Frederick II to dispose of his property in Camin; a 
permission which was granted by the king on the condition 
that with the sum realized by the sale of that estate, land 
should be purchased within the boundary of the Prussian do 
minions. 

The soldier, in any war exposed to numerous dangers, ran a 
much greater risk in a campaign like this, where so much de 
pended on a long and tedious voyage ; for should the voyage be 
successfully made, other and hitherto unknown hardships and 
dangers awaited the warrior who, set down in a distant part of 
the globe, was obliged to participate in a war which was con 
ducted on very different principles from those of Europe. 
America, much less known in those days than at present, was 
called, throughout a large portion of Germany, the " land of 
adventures and wonders." Stories, bordering on the fabulous, 
were told about it. There, the war could be carried into vast 
deserts. There, the wild men often invaded the lands of the 
colonists ; and horrible stories were told about the love of the 
Indians for scalps. Malignant fevers, from time to time, 
thinned the European population who were themselves in a 
semi-civilized state. Notwithstanding these reports, however, 
the Brunswick soldiers were in high spirits and cried, "Now for 
America ! " There were many Germans, they knew, in America, 
fighting on the side of the colonies against the English ; and 
if they could endure hardships, why should they not also ? 

The Brunswick corps that was destined for America, consisted 
of the following troops : 1st. A regiment of (dismounted) dragoons, under Lieut. Col. Baum. 2d. Prince Frederick s regiment 
of infantry, under Lieut. Col. Praetorius. 3d. Ilhet s regiment 
of infantry, under Lieut. Col. Van Ehrenkrook. 4th. Riedesel s 
former regiment of infantry under Lieut. Col. Von Specht. 5th. 
Battalion of grenadiers, under Lieut. Col. Breymann. 6th. Rifle 
battalion (yagers), under Lieut. Col. Earner. 

Although the troops were ready for the march on the 15th of 
February, as agreed upon in the treaty, they did not move until 
the 22d. This was owing to the fact that the vessels, upon which 
they were to embark, were not yet in readiness. 

There were busy times in Brunswick on that day, every one 
being desirous of seeing the troops leave for the far off land. 
The crowd was still further increased by people who had flocked 
in from the neighboring villages and hamlets to witness the

strange sight and bid their friends farewell. The duke and the 
prince appeared on horseback on the plaza where the soldiers 
were collected. The former made the men a parting address ; 
after which, to the sound of music and drums they marched by 
their beloved ruler each battalion, saluting him with a tremendous hurrah ! They had seen their sovereign and commander for 
the last time ! 

Colonel Riedesel bade his family adieu with a heavy heart. 
It seemed impossible for him to be separated from them for any 
length of time. He would gladly have taken them with him, 
but his wife was expecting to be confined within two weeks. He 
accordingly made an agreement with her that as soon as she was 
convalescent she should follow him. This, the loving and reso 
lute woman promised him with a joyful heart. We cannot omit 
giving in this connection a letter of the Duke Charles which 
bears witness both to the excellent heart of that prince and to 
the confidence that he placed in RiedeseFs devotion and capacity. 
It is as follows : 

" My dear Colonel Riedesel : I have received your report of 
this day in which you announce that everything is in readiness 
for to-morrow s march. Gratefully acknowledging your faithful 
services, and your well meaning sentiments tow r ards me, I do not 
in the least doubt that you will acquit yourself with your com 
mand to my entire satisfaction. You may rest assured that if 
in an unhoped for case it is the will of Heaven that you 
should fall, your wife and children shall be cared for as far as 
possible. I hope and pray that you may return well and sound, 
even should you not meet me again. In the meantime I expect 
to see you on the morrow in order to wish you in person all 
possible good fortune. " I remain ever, 

" Your affectionate 

" CHARLES, 

" Duke of Brunswick and Liineburg.

" LEIFERT, Pel. 22, 1776. 

" Dearest Wife : Never have I suffered more than upon my 
departure this morning. My heart was broken ; and could I 
have gone back who knows what I might have done. But, my 
darling, God has placed me in my present calling, and I must 
follow it. Duty and honor force me to this decision, and we 
must be comforted by this reflection and not murmur. Indeed, 
my chief solicitude arises from the state of your own health, in 
view of your approaching confinement. The care of our dear 
daughters, also, gives me anxiety. Guard most preciously the 
dear ones. I love them most fondly. 

"I am thus far on my journey without accident and in good 
health, although very tired in consequence of my anxiety of 
mind the past few days. I am hoping, however, for a refreshing sleep, and trust that you may be blessed in a similar manner. 

" I have this evening been raised to the rank of major-general. 
Therefore, my own Mrs. General, take good care of your health, 
in order that you may follow me as quickly as possible after 
your happy delivery. "

" Monseigneur : I am not able to express the joy which I felt 
when, the day previous to our march, I denied with the regiments 
in the presence of your excellency, and had the honor of bidding 
you, in the presence of the troops, a last farewell. Yet this last 
homage cost me great self-control, having all I could do to con 
ceal my sorrow and trouble. Will your excellency allow me to 
express my humblest thanks for the great honor and distinction 
you have had the kindness to extend to us. Our march has pro 
gressed better than I expected. We have not had a single desertion ; every one is content ; and I have not thus far had a single 
difficulty to adjust. Malordie is satisfied with us, and I have every 
reason to be equally so with him, and also, with the arrangements 
which have been made for the support of the troops. 

" We shall camp on the 5th in the vicinity of Stade, where I 
hope we will pass muster before Colonel Faucit, and be taken on 
board the ships as soon as they arrive. 

" May your excellency in the future grant me your high favor.

" ON THE ELBE, ON BOARD THE PALLAS, 

"March 19, 1776. 

" Monseigneur : I take the liberty of sending you a short report 
of that which has occurred during the march of the four batta 
lions of troops that left Wulfenbiittel on the 21st of February. 

" The following list will show your excellency at what places 
we encamped before arriving at Stade. We have finished our 
march without desertion, and without the least complaint either 
fmm the inhabitants or the men ; and, what is the most remark 
able feature in the whole of it is, that a large number of those 
who were very much fatigued held out to the end. 

" Colonel Faucit, on the 7th of March, reviewed the dragoons 
and the battalion of grenadiers. With the former he was very 
much pleased, but found some fault with the latter in regard to 
their height. Some of these, also, he thought too old but in 
the main he was satisfied. On the 8th he reviewed a regiment 
of infantry at Horneburg, and also Prince Frederick s regiment 
at Vortstade. He seemed more pleased with these regiments 
than with the grenadiers, especially the former. We dined at 
Vortstade, and in the evening returned to Stade. On the 9th 
he began drilling the recruits, and continued it until the 12th. 
On that day, which was Tuesday, the ships, to the number of 
seven, arrived; and, on the 13th the regiment of dragoons 
embarked in the greatest order and tranquillity. In two hours 
all was over. Colonel Faucit said that he had never witnessed 
an embarkation of troops which was so quiet and orderly. Not a single man was intoxicated. Colonel Faucit counted all the 
men once more ; and, although this was contrary to the agree 
ment. I consented, having a clear conscience. 

" On the 14th the two regiments of Riedesel and Prince Frede 
rick were quartered at Stade; and on the 15th four companies 
of my regiment were put on board of three vessels. The 16th 
I spent in visiting all the ships to see that nothing was wanting. 
Six more ships are to arrive to-day. The five remaining com 
panies of my regiment embarked on the 17th, as also did the 
entire regiment of Prince Frederick. The same order and 
quiet was maintained which was observed during the two previous 
embarkations. The 18th saw all our horses safely on board. I 
gave all the necessary lists to Colonel Faucit. We dined to 
gether; and after dinner I went on board my ship the Pallas, 
whence I have the honor of writing this to your excellency. 
This evening we start for Freyburg, and thence to Gliickstadt, 
where we shall wait for favoring winds in order to leave the 
Elbe. 

" I am unable sufficiently to describe the contentment of our 
soldiers. Every one is joyful and in good spirits. I leave it 
to my brother to give your excellency in person a more detailed 
account. 

" Monseigneur : Yes, I dare to say my most, most gracious 
and dear protector, this is the last letter I shall write you from 
Germany, and soon even from Europe. I therefore venture to 
beg of your excellency a favor, which to me is of great moment. 
It is this that you will not forget me, but preserve to me 
your kindness and love. As far as in me lies I will do all to 
deserve them. 

" I remain, etc., 

" RIEDESEL."

" ON BOARD THE PALLAS, March 21, 1776. 

" Here we are still quietly lying before Stade, in consequence 
of contrary winds ; we must therefore have patience. Never 
theless we shall to-day noon proceed to Friburg, which is not 
far from Grliickstadt, where we shall wait for more favorable 
winds to carry us out to sea, and across to England. Mean 
while we are quite content. Your presence only is necessary to 
complete my happiness, for I confess that I have the greatest 
longing to see you once more. 

" For your amusement, and that you may see how we pass 
away our time, I, herewith, send my journal. 

" First then, we have a state-room almost as large as your 
sitting-room. Upon both sides are two small cabins, in one of 
which is my bed, and in the other that of Captain Foy. In the 
state-room itself, on both sides are fixed four beds, in which 
sleep Captains Hensch, Gerlach, and Cleve, and the captain of 
the horse, Fricke. The cashier, the keeper of the military- 
chest, and the secretary, are in that part of the ship reserved 
for the soldiers, a private state-room having been put up especially for them. 

" I rise about seven o clock in the morning, after having said 
my prayers in bed. We dress ourselves quickly, and breakfast 
after the English fashion upon tea and bread and butter. Then 
I go upon deck to smoke my pipe. After that I write or read, 
drink my coffee, walk up and down with both the Englishmen, 
and with one or two pipes more pass away my time until two 
o clock when we have dinner. We have nine persons at table, 
have three dishes, and eat nearly an hour. Then the table 
cloth is taken off, and we spend nearly half or three-quarters of 
an hour drinking different healths as follows: First, the king- 
second, the duke ; third, yours and the children ; fourth, Captain Foy s wife ; fifth, a good sea voyage ; and sixth, a successful 
expedition in America. At four o clock, all is finished. Four 
bottles of wine are consumed daily, together with half a bottle 
of arrack for punch. Afterwards I drink coffee with the 
Englishmen. The remaining gentlemen provide for themselves. 
After coffee I visit the other vessels ; and in the evening play 
a rubber of whist. At half-past eight cold meat is brought 
on also wine for whoever will drink, and beer and at ten 
o clock all of us go to bed, and in this manner one day after 
another passes by. 

" Captain Foy goes from Dover to London to report himself 
to the king, and will rejoin me at Portsmouth. Upon his 
arrival there, I shall be transferred to a man-of-war, where 
everything will be more agreeably arranged for my comfort. 

" General (rage returned from America in this ship, at which 
time it had eight small state-rooms, an apartment for the gene 
ral, and a dining-room; all of which will be again fitted up. 
But of all this you shall hear in detail from me at Portsmouth, 
as also of the condition of things in America, and of the safest 
and quickest way for us again to see each other." 

On the 22d the reigning duke writes, himself, to General 
Riedesel, as follows : 

" I have with joy seen in the report of the major general that 
the march has progressed well. May God also in the future 
give it his blessing. The answer to your question is here inclosed. 
I refer to the letter of G. R. de Ferronce to the major general. 
I herewith send you, also, a list of the staff officers of the corps 
now on the march ; thoseof the first division left on the 29th 
"of February. To-day, the 21st of March, the two divisions take 
their departure. 

;i I have received nothing as yet from Mrs. Major General ; and 
I have accordingly sent an express to Wulfenbiittel, who has not, 
however, returned. I hope the news may be good. I shall soon send it to you. But I did not wish to delay longer sending off 
this letter. I have received the report of your brother. Wishing you and all the other officers success,

" ON BOARD THE PALLAS, opposite Dover, March 26, 1776. 

" I write you the instant we come in sight of the English 
coast. Captain Toy, Avho goes to London, will post this letter 
from that city. I mention to you with satisfaction that I have 
not been unwell a moment j still less have I been sea-sick ; but, 
on the contrary, have had a good appetite and good sleep the 
whole time. The soldiers, however, and also my servants, have 
mostly all been sick and yet remain so. The poor cook is so 
bad that he cannot do the least work, indeed, he cannot even 
raise his head. This is very inconvenient, since Captain Foy 
and myself are obliged to attend to the cooking, which would 
amuse you could you see us. 

" I will now give you a brief account of our voyage. Thurs 
day, we sailed from Stade to Fryburg. It was a magnificent 
spectacle to see the beautiful villages upon both banks of the 
stream. Grliickstadt, a fine Danish fortress, we left upon our 
right. We were in fine spirits, ate and drank heartily, and 
played whist in the evening. 

" Friday, we made sail for Hitzebiittel or Cashaven, where we 
hove to at evening in order to land and see the city, and play a 
rubber of whist. 

u Saturday we went to sea with a very gentle wind. We, 
however, hardly believed that we were at sea. We were all well 
and eat with great appetite. From the Ked Ton, where the 
Hanoverian pilots left us, I wrote you my last letter. In the 
afternoon, fishermen from Helgoland came on board, and I 
bought, for two thalers, 1 a large codfish, twenty haddocks, and 
four flounders, which I could not have obtained in Brunswick 
^pr ten thalers. Rainy weather now came on. 

" Sunday morning we had a heavy fog, and the sea became 
boisterous. Two guns were fired from our ship to indicate to 
the other vessels the route for them to take. The fog now 
lifted, the wind and the waves rose, but still there was no storm. 
Now all were sick. The cook could not cook. M tiller could 
not dress me. Valentine could find nothing. To sum up, 
great lamentation and great blundering arose on all sides. 
Hungry, I had nothing to eat. Finally, Captain Foy and my 
self cooked a pea soup in the sailor s kitchen, and eat cold roast 
beef, which made up our whole dinner. The soldiers eat 
nothing. 

" Monday the weather was somewhat milder, and some of the 
people became better, though most of them remained sick. 
Captain Foy and I once more cooked a portable bouillon soup, 
a cod with anchovy sauce, a ragout from roast beef, and a piece 
of roast veal with potatoes. 

" Tuesday we had the most beautiful weather in the world, 
and a few of the people became again well. The soldiers cooked 
for themselves, but the cook still could do nothing. Foy and 
myself, therefore, again did the cooking. We had rice soup, 
yellow turnips with beef, codfish with anchovy sauce, and a 
ragout of veal. From a distance one could see land. 

u To-day, Wednesday, we are opposite Dover. Captain Foy 
goes from us and takes this letter with him. Dearest angel, 
remember that every one may be sick upon the water j conse 
quently, you will have very little help from your servants. 
You must, therefore, choose the shortest route to England. I 
think the best one will be by way of Calais. 

" Captain Foy says that if Quebec is still ours, and there is no 
American army this side of Montreal, not only he, but General 
Carleton, also, will have his wife join him. You must positively not set out on your journey before they do then you 
can accompany them and travel with more safety, as you will 
have company and attendance, and want for nothing."

" LA PRAIRIE, June 22, 1776. 

" Monseigneur : We are at this place masters of the whole 
province of Canada ; and I feel confident that the good fortune, 
which has attended our troops thus far, will cause you to rejoice. 
If we had enough ships and sloops of war in which to cross Lake 
Champlain we would soon be in rear of the colonies. But as we 
are in need of the most necessary thing for crossing, and as all 
our vessels are yet to be built, this delay will lose us three weeks 
and materially impede our progress. At the same time, how 
ever, it will do much towards restoring the health of the troops, 
who, in consequence of hardships and poor fare, are much 
exhausted. 

" We have left the ships without taking any of our luggage, 
as the teams required for transporting it were needed for other 
purposes. We have marched about fourteen miles in three 
days; during the whole of which journey myself and the other 
officers were obliged to go on foot. This is the seventh day that 
I have worn the same shirt and stockings. At first it was disa 
greeable, but we stood it. All the officers manifest the very best 
spirit, and our troops are the strongest and have the fewest sick. 
" I am very happy to be under the command of General Carle- 
ton. He manifests such a contempt for the rebels, that I feel 
sure that we shall soon attack and get the best of them. 

" I commend myself, etc., 

" RlEDESEL."

" LA PRAIRIE, Sept. 31, 1776. 

" My Lord : The honor which your excellency has bestowed 
upon me, in giving me the command and supervision of the left 
wing of the army, induces me to express to you my humble 
opinion in regard to the distribution of the German troops into 
brigades as soon as they have all been brought together. By 
pursuing the course which I propose, each brigade will see not 
only that it is to be well led, but that a good officer has been 
given them. Ever since the year 1767 that officer has never 
been of a less rank than a lieutenant colonel a rule which 
has always secured them one of the oldest staff officers of the 
army. 

" I wish your excellency would kindly allow Prince Frederick s 
regiment to rejoin the army. Its place in the garrison at 
Quebec could be quickly replaced by drawing detachments from 
the different regiments composed of those recruits and invalids 
that are too young or feeble to stand the hardships of a cam 
paign. In case these should be used for garrison duty, it only 
depends on your excellency to have formed at once three bri 
gades of the German troops who are sufficient in number for 
the purpose in accordance with the plan which I have here 
the honor to inclose. The third brigade might also be used on 
the left wing, either as the advance, or in any manner which 
your excellency thinks best perhaps, in the same way as the 
brigade of General Fraser is employed on the right wing. This 
would greatly encourage Lieutenant Colonel Breymann, who now 
feels slighted at having been passed over in favor of younger 
lieutenant colonels. I will be responsible for his courage and 
military knowledge ; with his deportment I feel assured that 
your excellency will be satisfied. 

" For my own part, I have no other motive in making this 
request, but to maintain the good feeling between the troops of 
his majesty and ours who are in his pay; to satisfy all just 
demands; and to reap the approbation of your excellency, 
which is, and will be my only aim,

" TROIS RIVIERES, November 10, 1776. 

"Monseigneur : Ihopeyour excellency has by this time received 
my last letter of the 19th of October, which I sent to England by 
Captain Decker of the navy. I have now the honor of transmit 
ting to your excellency the continuation of my journal, and also 
of announcing the termination of this year s campaign, which has 
been a successful one for us, and has cost little blood. 

" If we could have begun our last expedition four weeks earlier, 
I am satisfied that everything would have been ended this year ; 
but not having shelter nor other necessary things, we were 
unable to remain at the other end of Lake Champlain. But I 
believe, and on pretty good grounds, that the whole affair 
will be terminated with another campaign. The rebels are 
losing courage. They know that they are being led astray by 
some ambitious men, but do not yet see how to get out of the 
fix. There are many, both in Albany and New York, who 
impatiently wait for the arrival of the northern army, to unite 
with it ; but at present, they dare not give expression to their 
feelings, for fear of losing their property and life. 

" As this, probably, is the last ship that will sail for England 
this year, I avail myself of this opportunity to express to your 
excellency my last sentiments of devotion for this year, hoping 
that your excellency may end it, a*s previous ones, in the best 
of health, welfare and contentment. 

" RIEDESEL."

At this time, General Riedesel wrote to Duke Ferdinand the 
following letter : 

" THREE RIVERS, April 10, 1777. 

" Monseigneur : I am very much flattered by the fact that 
your excellency still remembers his old servant, who will never 
forget that, for his present position, as well as for the little 
knowledge he possesses, he is indebted to yourself. His grate 
fulness will, therefore, never cease. I have taken the liberty of 
writing your excellency very often during the past year, and 
have sent you from time to time, a continuation of the journal 
so far as regards all that has occurred in our army the past year. 
But having received no answer, I am unable to te ll whether all 
my reports have reached you or not. It is unfortunate that 
letters from Europe are so long in coming. 

Our army have remained very quietly in their winter quar 
ters; in fact, there has not been a solitary rifle discharged 
against the enemy the last ten months. The lakes, large rivers, 
"indeed, everything has been covered with ice. In addition to 
which, the monstrous deserts and forests have aided in putting 
an end, for the time being, to this insignificant war. Care for 
the health of the men, and drilling, have thus far been our only 
occupation. The entire army, which, by the bye, is in excellent 
condition, is always ready to march at a moment s notice, and 
will move as soon as the melting of the ice will permit a passage 
down Lake Champlain. We are, at present, opposite Mahahu- 
gets bay. in the vicinity of which are those rebels that General 
Howe left in his rear when he marched south into Pennsylva 
nia. It is my belief that this campaign will finish the war, 
provided we are successful in driving the enemy away from 
there. We have hardly any news of the movements of General Howe s army ; and the little which we do hear is so con 
tradictory, that I will not mention it, for fear of giving false 
reports. I hope that as soon as the fleet is ready, our operations 
will progress faster than they did last year, and that I shall be 
able to report events to your excellency of more interest than 
those of the last campaign.

" THREE RIVERS, May 8, 1777. 

u P. S. No ship having sailed when I wrote the above, I 
have now the honor of communicating to your excellency, that 
General Burgoyne returned from London, on the Apollo, day 
before yesterday. He brings me five letters from your excellency ; the first, dated at Gardersheim, October llth ; the second, 
October 21st, from the same place; and the last three from 
Brunswick, under dates respectively, of November 22d, 23d, and 
28th. These five letters have given me exceeding great joy. 
I return my humblest thanks to your excellency for the kind 
expressions of regard which you manifest in all your letters. 
Your excellency is perfectly right in saying that it would have 
been of great advantage, could we have wintered at the southern 
extremity of the lake. The facts, however, which I have 
written down in my journal to you of last year, will show the im 
possibility, and the reasons for not doing it. The only benefit 
which has resulted from the expedition up the lake last fall is, 
that the fleet of the rebels has been destroyed a loss which, 
to them, is irreparable, and which, also, will greatly facilitate 
our passage up the lake this year. The instructions which 
have been brought to General Carleton, by General Burgoyne, 
will, I believe, inaugurate the campaign immediately, in which 
case I shall soon be able to transmit more interesting news to 
your excellency. I am, etc.,

AV THE AMERICAN EEVOL UTION. \\ 5 

at the usual speed. Iliedesel, after marching about a quarter 
of an hour, heard a hrisk firing of musketry. He, therefore, 
pushed forward with his advance guard with still greater 
rapidity. Captain Pocllnitz being sent back to tell Lieutenant 
Colonel Breymann to follow on as quickly as possible. 

In the meantime a second officer arrived from Fraser and 
reported to the Brunswick geneifil that the former had met the 
enemy in such force that he would not be able to withstand him 
unless he was speedily reenforced. It was impossible, however, 
for Iliedesel to hasten any faster. He, accordingly, sent word 
to Fraser that he was already on the way to his aid and would 
soon be with him. At last the Brunswick troops, after a rapid 
march of a quarter of an hour, arrived, terribly heated, upon an 
eminence from which could be seen the contending forces. 

General Iliedesel saw at a glance that the Americans were 
moving more and more toward the right with the evident 
intention of surrounding Fraser s left wing. He, therefore, 
resolved to out manoeuvre them and get into their rear. 
Accordingly he ordered the company of yagers to advance 
to the attack, while the rest of the troops were to endeavor to 
fall upon the enemy s rear. In order to puzzle the enemy, and 
make him believe that his assailants were stronger than they 
really were, he ordered a band of music to precede the ya 
gers. At this moment an aid arrived with a message from 
Fraser, to the effect that he feared his left wing would be sur 
rounded. Iliedesel sent word back to him that he was at that 
very instant about to attack the enemy s right wing. 

The company of yagers advanced courageously upon the 
enemy, and were met by a brisk fire from four hundred men. 
Far, however, from shrinking, the Brunswickers did not flinch, 
but paid them back with interest. Under their brave leader, 
Captain Van Geyso, they advanced upon the enemy with fixed 
bayonets and to the sound of music. In twelve minutes they 
had beaten them completely^ and captured twelve pieces. Captain Schottelius, at the head of the grenadiers, also attacked 
the enemy at the same time, when seeing that they were partly 
surrounded, the Americans stopped fighting and retreated. 
Greneral Fraser acknowledged that he would have been in great 
danger, had it not been for Riedesel s timely aid ; for if reen- 
forcements had not arrived just when they did, the whole corps 
would have been surrounded and cut off. Those of the Bruns- 
wickers who had followed, also fastened their march and arrived 
upon the same eminence just as the firing ceased. 

The American forces on this occasion, consisted of four regiments commanded by Brigadier Francis. He fell, pierced by 
a German bullet, while leading the third attack on the left 
wing, and was buried by the Brunswick troops. This corps of 
Francis formed the rear guard of the American army in its 
retreat from Fort Carillon. 

A few days after this event, Riedesel wrote to Duke Ferdi 
nand in relation to this engagement, as follows : 

"SKINSBURY, 1 July 11, 1777. 

" Monseigneur : So tired that I can scarcely move, I send your 
excellency these few lines. In order to inform you of the great 
success which has attended our arms since July the 1st, I send 
your excellency, inclosed, the continuation of my journal. 

" The great courage manifested by a handful of German troops 
in the engagement near Hubberton, and the good services they 
have rendered toward the successful termination of that action, 
will certainly please your excellency ; and I can assure you, in 
all sincerity, that this occasion has given a good name to the 
Brunswick troops among the whole of the army. We shall 
continue our march from here to Fort Ann and Fort Edward. 
It is said that the enemy will raise another army of five thou 
sand men. This army, however, will have no artillery, as all 
of their guns are in our hands. It is, therefore, to be supposed 
that the second engagement will take place at, or in the vicinity 
of Fort Edward. I recommend myself, etc. 

" RIEDESEL." 

1 Probably Skcensborough. 



IN THE AMERICAN RE VOL UTI ON. \\^ 

After this engagement, General Riedesel posted his troops in 
the following manner : Earner s light infantry were placed upon 
the left wing of the English for the support of the yagers 
and grenadiers. The battalion of grenadiers and his own regiment were sent to the right of the English wing in order to 
guard the road leading to Skeensborough, as the army were 
now to march for that place. 

While these events were taking place upon land, General 
Burgoyne was pursuing the enemy upon the water. In a few 
hours he destroyed the moorings near Carillon, on which the 
Americans had worked several months ; and, by a few well 
directed cannon shots, he broke in two the collossal chain upon 
which so many hopes had been hung. 

On the evening of the 6th of July, he encountered the ships 
of the enemy near Skeensborough, and destroyed them after a 
short engagement. Three of these the enemy burned, and two 
were captured. The fort at that place was then evacuated by 
the rebels, who retreated to Fort Anne. Lieutenant Colonel 
Hill with a detachment was thereupon sent by Burgoyne, to take 
this fort, but finding it too strongly fortified, and occupied by 
an American corps, he did not succeed. On the morning of 
the 8th, he was attacked by a superior force of Americans, and, 
after a long fight, was forced to retreat. In this engagement, 
both sides suffered considerable loss. 

A great quantity of provisions, ammunition and other war 
material were found at Skeensborough. The army encamped 
there on the following day. 

The corps both of Fraser and of Riedesel having had no provi 
sions for four days, and being unable to obtain any from their 
ships it was agreed that Riedesel should march to Skeensborough, 
and Fraser should remain where he was until further orders 
had been received from Burgoyne in relation to the disposition 
of the wounded. At noon of the 8th of July, the Brunswickers 
accordingly marched to Skeensborough. Hitherto the first 
German brigade had been with General Burgoyne. The left 
wing encamped on the left bank of Wood creek, and the right, 
on the right bank. 

On the 9th, General Fraser arrived in the camp and took 
his position on the right wing. On the 10th, General lliedesel 
received orders to march with his corps. The first brigade was 
to encamp on the Castletown river. From here patrols were to 
be sent into the enemy s country to encourage the loyal Ameri 
cans to take up arms on the side of the king. 

On the 10th, General Burgoyne issued the following order : 

ORDER FROM HEAD QUARTERS, JULY lOxn, 1777. 

" The rebels evacuated Fort Ticonderoga on the 6th, having 
been forced into this measure by the presence of our army. On 
one side of the lake they ran as far as Skeensborough : on the 
other side as far as Hubberton. They left behind all their 
artillery, provisions and baggage. 

"Brigadier Fraser, with one-half of his brigade and without 
artillery, met two thousand rebels strongly fortified ; attacked 
and drove them from their position. The latter lost many of their 
officers. Two hundred were killed, more wounded, and three 
hundred captured. Major General Von lliedesel, with his 
advanced guard, consisting of the company of yagers (eighty 
men), light infantry and grenadiers, came up in time to support 
Brigadier Fraser ; and by his judicious orders, and the bravery . 
with which they were executed, he, as well as his troops, shared 
in the honor of the victory. 

" On the 8th, Lieutenant Colonel Hill was attacked by the 
rebels at Fort Anne, and notwithstanding he was outnumbered 
six to one, he drove them off with great loss after a contest of 
three hours. In consequence of this affair, the rebels evacuated 
Fort Anne after setting it on fire. A detachment of our army 
now occupies it. 1 

" The rapid progress of our arms for which we cannot suffi 
ciently thank God gives great honor to our troops. The 



The garrison consisted of one captain, one hundred men and two cannons. 



IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 1 19 

GREATEST PRAISE is due General Yon lliedesel and Brigadier 
Fraser, who by their bravery, supported by officers and soldiers, 
have rendered the greatest service to the king. 

: - The highest honor is due to the troops from the fact that in 
spite of the many fatigues they have undergone through 
incle*ment weather, and without bread they have never shown 
the least insubordination. THEREFORE, on next Sunday there 
shall be divine service in front of the army and the advance 
guard, and in the evening at sunset there shall be firing of 
cannon and small arms. This shall also be done at Ticonderoga, 
Crown point, the camp at Skeensborough, at Castletown and in 
the camp of Colonel Breymann. The commander of each 
regiment shall, himself, read this order to his regiment ; and 
Major General Von Riedesel will see to it that this order shall 
be sent to the detached corps of the left wing. Brigadier 
Hamilton will send it to Crown point. 

" BURGOYNE." 

All the news, respecting the position of the enemy, indicated 
that they were in the vicinity of Fort Edward, under General 
Schuyler. 

On the morning of the 12th, General Riedesel started with 
the corps of Breymann and the infantry regiment Riedesel. The 
troops were embarked and sailed through South bay and East 
creek as far as the latter was navigable. They then went on 
shore at the landing place, where the Hesse Hanau regiment, 
which had preceded them, was already encamped. The corps 
of Breymann continued its march on land as far as the sawmill 
near Castletown, where it bivouacked for the night. The next 
day it marched to Castletown, the regiment Riedesel remaining 
until the day after, when it marched to the camp of Brigadier 
Specht. This march was attended with extraordinary diffi 
culties. It was impossible to procure horses ; consequently all 
the tents and baggage had to be carried by the soldiers on 
their backs over a shockingly bad road. $his tramp lasted for 



120 MAJOR GENERAL EIEDESEL 

five hours, and was partly the occasion of the brigade of Specht 
having to pass four, and the other regiments three, days in the 
woods, without tents. On his arrival at 11 A. M. in the camp of 
Brigadier Specht, General Riedesel sent out a party of troops 
to collect wagons and horses, which were to be employed in 
transporting the baggage and other army supplies. In addition, 
also, to the above grievances a great many of the troops in 
camp, especially of the regiments of Specht and Rhetz, were 
suffering from dysentery. 

On the 14th, Riedesel inspected the camp of Specht and 
Breymann, and made a few alterations here and there in the 
distribution of the out posts. Foreseeing, also, that during the 
long and tiresome marches, which the army would have to 
undergo, the lack of facilities for transportation would be often 
felt, Riedesel ordered, that all officers should provide themselves 
with horses on which to carry their own personal equipage 
the latter to consist of as few articles as possible. 

On the 15th, General Riedesel was ordered to Ticonderoga 
to superintend the removal of the ships to Lake George. Of 
the two regiments yet remaining at Ticonderoga the 62d 
English and Prince Frederick s one-half of each, under the 
command of Colonel Amstruther, and Major Yon Hiller, was to 
cover the removal. The same day Riedesel received intelligence that a corps of the enemy numbering between four and 
five thousand men, under Colonel Warner, was near Manches 
ter. It was also reported that the latter was using his utmost 
exertions to rally the militia in the vicinity, and thus strengthen 
his own corps. Owing, however, to the fact that Colonel 
Skene, the governor of the province, 1 was desirous of having 
him accompany him to Castletown to aid in making a list of all 
the loyal inhabitants, he could do nothing for the present against 
Warner. 



1 This Colonel Skene was royal governor of Crown point. Ticonderoga and those 
townships and forts in New York and New Hampshire which bordered on Lakes 
Champlain and George and the Hudson river. Note to the German edition. 



IN THE AMERICAN REVOL UTION. 121 

About four hundred inhabitants from different townships 
came into Castletowii and took the oath of allegiance in due 
form, each one receiving a certificate to that effect. A large 
number of these people were not in earnest in taking this oath. 
They had only come that they might find out the names of those 
who were truly loyal and afterwards betray them. They went, 
therefore, immediately back to their comrades and told them 
all they had seen and heard. No sooner had Colonel Warner 
heard the report of these spies, than he at once advanced, 
plundered the loyalists, took away their cattle, and even carried 
off the men themselves. Riedesel, who had promised to protect 
them, immediately dispatched Captain Willoe to head quarters 
as the bearer of a plan to Burgoyne, in which he proposed to 
attack the traitors at once, and take from them what cattle and 
vehicles might be necessary for the use of his troops. 

The English general had no objections to the plan; still he 
would not consent to its execution, pretending that he intended 
soon to make a move with his whole army. But although the 
German general s hands were thus tied, he determined at least to 
make any future operations of the enemy difficult. He, therefore, 
sent a detachment of seventy men to Tinmouth, and another to 
Wells riding himself toward Rutland and Wells for the purpose 
of reconnoitering. The detachment sent to Wells returned on 
the evening of the 19th, and reported that Colonel Warner had 
returned to Manchester, and that those of the inhabitants w r ho 
had fallen under suspicion of disloyalty, had left their houses, 
taking their furniture and most of their stock with them. 
Nevertheless the detachment brought in a few heads of cattle, 
and carts with the teams belonging to them. 

The day previous, the two partisans, St. Luke and Lancelot, 
arrived at head quarters with one thousand Indians and some 
Canadian volunteers. On the same day, Riedesel learned that 
the long expected ship, having on board recruits from Europe, 
had arrived at Three Rivers. General Phillips, also, returned 
the same day from Ticonderoga. 
16 
On the 20th, the other detachment returned, having been 
within a mile and a half of Colonel Warner s camp. They 
brought with them four prisoners, and about sixty head of 
cattle. Colonel Warner was so alarmed at the sudden appearance of this detachment, that he immediately evacuated Man 
chester, and retreated to Arlington. 

On the 21st, General Burgoyne went on a reconnoitering 
expedition by way of Forts Anne and Edward in order to 
ascertain the position of the enemy in that vicinity. He wrote 
to General Riedesel to move in a few days with his army in the 
direction of those forts ; telling him, also, that he might expect 
more particular directions from him on his (Burgoyne s) arrival 
at Fort Anne. Riedesel was at this time suffering severely from 
an ulcerated tooth and a raging fever. But, although confined 
to his room, he was not idle. He apportioned the new recruits 
among the different regiments, in order that there might be no 
confusion when they should arrive ; for at present they were to 
remain in Canada until they had learned the drill. The recruits 
were apportioned as follows : 

Men. 

To the regiment of Dragoons, .... 25 
" Prince Frederick, . . 39 

" Rhetz, 32 

" Riedesel, . . 35 

" Specht, 26

The grenadier battalion of Breymann received men from the 
other regiments as follows :

LV THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, 123 

Tn pursuance of an order from the duke, those men, only, 
who had already served one year and a half and had a certain 
height, were to be taken for this battalion. 

The order on this subject, under date of July 19th, says that 
men must be selected who are thoroughly reliable, and of such 
strength and appearance as will answer for grenadiers." llied- 
esel issued strict orders in regard to the conduct of the troops 
toward the inhabitants and their property. Inasmuch, also,- as 
there were a large number of loyal inhabitants scattered through 
the country, who were often taken for rebels, the strictest orders 
had to be issued lest the soldiers should treat them as such. In 
one of these orders, under date of July 22, the following passage 
occurs : " Breaking into houses, plundering and similar excesses 
will be punished; if the first offense, by whipping, and, if the 
second, by running the gauntlet." And at the end of this order, 
of which the colonel of each regiment received a copy, it further 
says : "In order to avoid all misunderstanding respecting the 
treatment of the inhabitants by those detachments that are sent 
out from time to time, and to avoid all marauding, this order is 
given to you. You will be able to judge best what is legitimate 
booty, and whether or not it can be allowed to the soldier." 

At noon of the 24th, liiedesel received orders to march with 
the left wing to Skeensborough ; but the soldiers, being at that 
moment in the act of cooking their dinner, he allow r cd them 
first to finish it. Upon the reception of the orders, however, 
he sent a message to the battalion of grenadiers and the bri 
gade of Specht, telling them to start for the landing place, and 
be ready for embarkation the following day. The regiment 
Hanau, which had remained up to this time at the latter place 
for the protection of the ships and baggage, also received orders 
to embark, and arrived at the appointed time at Skeensborough. 
When the German troops reached there on the 25th, the right 
wing of the army, under General Phillips, had already started 
and was encamped near Gordon s house. General Fraser started 
as early as the 22d for this place, his departure being hastened 
by intelligence that the Americans had evacuated Fort Edward 
on the 21st. He, therefore, hastened on in advance to occupy 
it. At Skeensborough, Riedesel met Burgoyne and held a 
consultation with him in regard to the advance of the army. 

Great discouragement must have prevailed at this time in the 
army of General Schuyler ; for many deserters now came into 
the English army, while others ran away to their homes. Many 
had been forced into the American ranks, and these naturally 
took the first opportunity to escape. 

On the 26th, Riedesel sent back the vessels to Ticonderoga 
with the sick and superfluous baggage. The sick were to re 
main in the hospital at that place, and the ships and baggage 
were to be transported by Canadians to Lake George, and thence 
to Fort Edward on the Hudson river. Those Brunswick officers, 
who were deputed to bring back from Canada the new recruits, 
also returned on these vessels. 

As it was impossible for teams to make any progress on the 
road from Skeensborough to Fort Anne, two English vessels 
were laden with the baggage and sent up Wood creek to that 
fort. The troops marched on that day as far as Gordon s house, 
and thence to Fort Anne. An English detachment, under Major 
Irving, and fifty Germans, remained at Skeensborough for the 
purpose of facilitating the transportation on Wood creek. 

General Fraser, upon arriving in the vicinity of Fort Edward, 
found that the report of the Americans having evacuated that 
place was unfounded. They were still in possession, but retreated 
on the appearance of the English. The Indians who were in 
advance, went within cannon shot of the fort, when a severe, but 
ineffectual firing took place. They returned, bringing with them 
eight prisoners unscalped. General Burgoyne established his 
head quarters at Fort Edward on the 31st of July. General 
Riedesel, who also went there on the same day, 1 describes the

escaped. A patrol of the enemy endeavored to way-lay him in the woods, but just

position of the Americans as a very advantageous one. Mean 
while. General Phillips having accomplished the removal of 
the stores and artillery from Ticonderoga had arrived at Fort 
George, and was busily engaged in building a road from that 
fort to Fort Edward. 

The Americans, who had in the meantime retreated as far as 
Schuyler s island, left there on this day (the 31st) and retreated 
to Half Moon, 1 twelve miles this side of Albany. They were 
led by General Arnold, the one who had lost the engagement 
on Lake Champlain. He superseded General Schuyler, who 
had been summoned to appear before congress. It was believed 
that General Arnold would unite with General Washington, who 
was then at the highlands, and that this movement would be the 
last effort of the rebels, who were already looked upon as lost. 
It was, therefore, determined that as soon as the vessels should 
arrive, and the detachment 2 return, the march of annihilation 
should be continued southward. 

On the 1st day of August, General Riedesel celebrated the 
birthday of his sovereign at Fort Anne, with as much ceremony 
as circumstances would permit. 

By the 3d of August, a sufficient number of teams had been 
collected to enable a few regiments to begin the march. The 
battalion of grenadiers started first, and encamped near Fort 
Edward to the left of the corps of Fraser. The regiments 
Specht and Riedesel left Fort Anne on the 4th and the same 
day, the regiment Rhetz was ordered to march to the Ritsch- 
field plains between Fort Edward and Fort Anne, and relieve 
the 21st English regiment. On the same day, an official dis 
patch was received from General Howe, in which he communi 
cated several things of importance to General Burgoyne. The 
latter, however, kept the news so secret that nothing could be 



as they were on the point of accomplishing their object, a party of Indians also 
out on a scout suddenly made their appearance, forcing the rebels to retreat. 

1 The present town of Crescent in Saratoga county. 

2 1. e., the one that had been left at Skeensborough, Whitehall. 
learned except that Howe was close to General Washington who 
occupied a fortified position in the highlands. It was therefore 
supposed that a general engagement between the two armies 
would soon take place. The news of the retreat of the Ameri 
cans from Saratoga to Stillwater was also received at this time 
Nor were the Indians idle. They attacked a detachment of the 
enemy, killed twenty, and captured ten men. 

Several desertions having occurred in the English army, 
Burgoyne ordered the Indians to pursue and scalp all that 
they should capture. 

On the 9th, Brigadier Powell was ordered to take with him 
the 53d Regiment and relieve Brigadier Hamilton at Ticonde- 
roga : at the same time the 62d was ordered to rejoin the army. 
The company of Canadian militia, under Boucherville, was to 
remain for the present at Fort George. The regiment Prince 
Frederick was still stationed at Ticonderoga. 

On the same day, Fraser, with his advance corps, started 
again and encamped near Fort Miller, seven miles from Fort 
Edward. Lieutenant Colonel Baum followed with the dragoon 
regiment, with which soon afterward were incorporated the 
Brunswick regiment of light infantry, a detachment of Canadian 
volunteers and two cannons. Altogether they numbered five 
hundred men. With this force he was to go on an expedition 
in the direction of the Connecticut river. The object of this 
expedition was peculiar, namely, to procure good horses from 
the inhabitants, on which to mount the dragoons. Besides this, 
it was hoped that thirteen hundred additional horses could be 
obtained from the same source, to be used in transporting the 
baggage. Connecticut, new at that time, was one of the most 
flourishing states in North America, and made a special business of breeding excellent cattle and horses. 

On the 10th, Riedesel received authentic news from General 
Howe s army. According to the intelligence received, that 
general had rallied his troops in June near Fort Knyphausen, 
evacuated the province of Jersey, and sent Clinton with a strong 



AV TIl A MERICA IT EE VOL UTION. 127 

advance guard toward the highlands, where Washington was 
encamped. He had also sent a few frigates up the Hudson for 
the purpose of making the enemy believe that he was meditating 
an attack at that point. General Washington, believing this, 
went into a fortified camp. As soon as Howe heard of the 
success of his ruse, he threw off all disguise, embarked his army 
under a favorable wind, and entered the Delaware river. Wash 
ington did not learn of this movement until a week after, when 
he at once evacuated his fortified position, and leaving Putnam 
in the highlands to watch Clinton, retreated into Pennsylvania 
with the intention of preventing the further advance of Howe. 
Meanwhile, four English frigates attempted to sail up the narrow 
passage of the Hudson through the highlands and reach Albany. 
At the same time, Howe detached another body of troops up 
the Connecticut river with orders to advance as far as Spring 
field, and then march parallel with the Canadian army, provided 
the latter had reached Albany. 



In the meantime, (reneral Burgoyne resolved to capture the 
magazine at Bennington. The conduct of this expedition was 
intrusted to Colonel Baum, who was ordered not to march by 
way of Manchester, as had been at first considered advisable, 
but direct to Bennington. General Riedesel took the liberty 
of calling attention to the dangers connected with this under 
taking, Bennington being at too great a distance, and the 
enemy too near it. But the English commander was not a man 
to be dissuaded by any one from any project he had determined 
upon. General Riedesel, therefore, seeing that Burgoyne s 
purpose could not be changed, did his best to prepare the de 
tachment for the march as quickly as possible. They were 
rendezvoused at Fort Miller; and Brigadier Fraser being 
unable to furnish his quota of men, General Hiedesel completed 
it by detaching one hundred men from the corps of Breymaun. 



128 MAJOR GENERAL RIED^SEL 

As the motives of this unsuccessful expedition have been 
described by the historians of the North American war in such 
a contradictory manner, we take the liberty of giving them 
verbatim as we find them in General Riedesel s journal. He 
says : 

"Lieutenant Colonel Baum marched to-day (llth), from 
Fort Miller to the Battenkill. General Burgoyne rode up to 
him to give him further instructions. As the said general had 
received intelligence that there was a magazine of considerable 
importance at Bennington defended only by a small body of 
militia, he countermanded the instructions he had previously 
given Baum, and ordered him, instead of marching to Manchester and thence to Bennington, to take the direct road, attack 
the enQiny and capture the magazine. General Burgoyne 
informed General Riedesel, upon the latter s return from Fort 
George, of the alteration in his plan respecting the expedition 
under Lieutenant Colonel Baum. General Riedesel expressed 
his fear and astonishment in regard to the danger attending 
it. General Burgoyne, however, considered the change in the 
plan necessary for the following reasons : 1st. It would be of 
great advantage to the army to gather their subsistence from 
the captured magazine of the enemy, until supplies could be 
transported to the army sufficient to last for four weeks. 2d. 
In case he should move with his whole army against the enemy 
near Stillwater, General Arnold would not be able to send a 
strong force against Colonel Baum. 3d. That he had received 
intelligence that Colonel St. Leger was besieging Fort Stanwix, 
and that Arnold intended to send a considerable force to the 
relief of this place ; therefore, it was of the greatest importance 
that a detachment of the left wing should make a move and 
thus intimidate the enemy, and prevent him from sending this 
force against St. Leger. These three reasons overruled the 
representations of General Riedesel." 

Bennington is situated between the two arms of the Hoosick 
river, about twenty-four miles east of the Hudson. The road 

X 



IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 129 

thither was very bad, and led through dense woods. A royalist, 
who knew the road, and offered to guide Lieutenant Colonel 
Bauin, also called the attention of Burgoyne to the dangers 
connected with this expedition, and stated that at least three 
thousand men were necessary, as the Americans would exert 
themselves to the utmost to hold their position. But in spite of 
all this, it was destined that the expedition should start. 

On the 12th of August, Lieutenant Colonel Baum marched 
from the Battenkill to Cambridge, 1 at which place he met a 
detachment of the enemy, which he attacked and defeated, 
capturing a few supplies and eight prisoners. 2 

On the 13th, Bauin reported to Burgoyne that he had heard 
the magazine at Bennington was defended by between fifteen 
and eighteen hundred militia men ; but, on account of their 
disaffection, he believed they would evacuate the fort upon 
his appearance. He would, therefore, at once march upon the 
enemy. General Burgoyne, very much pleased with his report, 
immediately consented, with the understanding, however, that he 
was not to make the attack until he had thoroughly acquainted 
himself with the position of the enemy. In order to make the 
attack successfully, Baum determined to halt four miles this 
side of Bennington, and carry out the advice of his commanding 
general. Lieutenant Colonel Breymann marched on this day 
from Fort Edward to Douart s house ; while Eraser, who was to 
advance as far as Saratoga, started in advance. On the 14th, 
the army began to advance from Pouart s house. 

At six o clock on the morning of the 15th, General Burgoyne 
received a report from Lieutenant Colonel Baum, dated the 



1 The present town of Cambridge in Washington county, N. Y. 

2 Stedman, in his History of the American War, part 1, p. 417, states that Baum 
captured on the first day an American corps, which was released the following day 
by Colonel Skene, under the impression that this act of magnanimity would influence the released Americans to take no further part against their king. He adds 
that these very ones fought the hardest against the English at Bennington. No 
mention, however, of this circumstance is made either in RiedeseFs journals or in 
the report of Baum. Note in original. 

17 
14th, in which he stated that his advance guard, on its march 
to Bennington, had been attacked by a corps of the enemy num 
bering about seven hundred men, but after a few cannon shot 
had been fired they had retreated. He also said that, from 
prisoners and loyalists he had learned that a body of eighteen 
hundred men were in camp near Bennington, favorably situated 
and fortified, and who were only waiting for additional reen- 
forcements to meet and attack him. He, therefore, asked for 
reenforcements. Burgoyne immediately instructed Riedesel to 
send Lieutenant Colonel Breymann to his support. Riedesel, 
who was much troubled in regard to the entire movement, asked 
and obtained permission of Burgoyne, to give Breymann a few 
suggestions. The latter set out at once, leaving the tents, bag 
gage and superfluous ammunition. A rain that had fallen for 
several days, made the roads, which were already miserable, 
even worse ; and this circumstance, added to the lack of horses 
for the transportation of artillery, forced Breymann, after a 
short march, to bivouac seven miles this side of Cambridge. 
He, therefore, dispatched a few men to Baum to notify him of 
his advance. The latter had been again attacked on this same 
day, but was able to repulse the enemy with his artillery ; and 
having confidence in his position, and expecting speedy reen 
forcements, he resolved to stand his ground. Toward nine 
o clock, on the morning of the 16th, small bodies of armed men 
made their appearance from different directions. These men 
were mostly in their shirt sleeves. They did not act as if they 
intended to make an attack ; and Baum, being told by the pro 
vincial, who had joined his army on the line of march, that 
they were all loyalists and would make common cause with him, 
suffered them to encamp on his side and rear. 1 Shortly after 
another force of the rebels arrived and attacked his rear ; but, 
with the aid of artillery, they were again repulsed. After a little

defeat at Beunington. and consequently the defeat of Burgoyne. This is an entirely 
new revelation. 



AY THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. \^\ 

while a stronger body made their appearance and attacked more 
vigorously. This was the signal for the seeming royalists, who 
had encamped on the side and rear of the army, to attack the 
Germans ; and the result was, that Baum suddenly found him 
self cut off from all his detached posts. For over two hours 
he withstood the sallies and fire of the enemy his dragoons, 
to a man, fighting like heroes but at last, his ammunition 
being used up, and no reenforcements arriving, he was obliged 
to succumb to superior numbers and retreat. The enemy 
seemed to spring out of the ground ; indeed, they were esti 
mated at between four and five thousand men. Twice the 
brave dragoons succeeded in breaking a road through the 
enemy s ranks ; for, upon their ammunition giving out, Baum 
ordered that they should hang their carbines over their shoulders, 
and trust to their swords ; but bravery was now in vain, and 
the heroic leader, himself severely wounded, was forced to sur 
render with his dragoons. Meanwhile, the Indians and pro 
vincials had taken flight, and sought safety in the forest. 

Lieutenant Colonel Breymann, who had again started early 
on the morning of the 16th, reached the bridge of St. Luke at 
three o clock in the afternoon. Here he met Governor Skene, 
who assured him that he was only two miles distant from Lieu 
tenant Colonel Baum. Skene, however, not informing him of 
the events that had occurred he continued his march as quickly 
as possible, notwithstanding his troops were greatly fatigued. 
Scarcely, however, had he advanced fifteen hundred paces on 
the bridge, when he saw a strongly armed fore occupying an 
eminence toward the west. Governor Skene assured him that 
this force were not rebels; but Breymann, not satisfied with 
this assurance, sent ahead a patrol toward the eminence, who 
were immediately received with a volley of musketry. Upon 
perceiving how the case stood, he at once ordered Major Barner 
to advance upon the eminence, sent his grenadiers to the right, 
put the guns of both regiments into position, and directed the 
fire upon a log-house occupied by the enemy. The Germans 
drove the Americans across three hills ; but their ammunition 
soon giving out, they were obliged to cease from the pursuit. 
The enemy, guessing the cause of the halt, in their turn once 
more advanced; upon which Breymann, relying solely upon 
the darkness, which was fast coming on, to save himself, halted 
his men opposite the enemy, and remained there till it was per 
fectly dark. He then, under cover of the darkness, retreated 
across the bridge, but was obliged to leave his cannon. At 
twelve o clock at night he arrived with his fatigued corps, at 
Cambridge, and reached the army on the Battenkill on the 17th. 1 

General Burgoyne received the news of the unfortunate 
termination of both engagements at three o clock on the morning of the 17th. He immediately consulted with General 
Riedesel, and resolved to start with the entire army and save, 
if possible, one or the other corps. Captain Gerlach was, there 
upon, sent to find Breymann and tell him to rejoin the army, 
which was on its way for his relief, under the command of 
Riedesel. While on his way, however, to the relief of these 
corps, he received orders from Burgoyne to take up a position 
on the Battenkill. Here he received news from Breymann 
that he had escaped with his corps, and was within six miles of 
the Battenkill. Riedesel immediately reported this intelligence to Burgoyne, who ordered him to return again to his 
former camp. 

General Burgoyne, after these events, saw plainly that he 
could not advance without supplies ; and, accordingly, he deter- 



ir The missing officers were Lieutenant Colonel Baum, Major Von Maiborn : 
captains of cavalry, Von Fricke, Von Reineking, Von Schlagenteuffel, Jan. ; 
Lieutenants Von Reckrodt, Von Bottimer ; Cornets Schoenewald, Graesse, Stutzer ; 
Adjutant Boera, Quartermaster Gerfeckc, Chaplain Mulzagine, Auditor Thomas, 
and Lieutenant Von Reichenfeld. The dragoon regiment which suffered so 
severely in this engagement consisted of four squadrons. According to a report 
by Adjutant Cleve, dated August 26, 1777, the regiment should have numbered 20 
officers, 33 non-commissioned officers, 8 musicians, 246 privates and 20 servants. 
The number now was 5 officers, 5 non-commissioned officers, 2 musicians, 77 pri 
vates and 14 servants. Missing, therefore, 15 officers, 28 non-commissioned officers, 
6 musicians, 169 privates and 6 servants.

mined to remain for the present at Douart s house. At the 
same time, however, he entrusted to Riedesel the duty of maintaining communication with Fort Anne and Fort George. The 
latter, therefore, having with him the German regiments of 
Rhetz and Hesse Hanau, and the 47th English regiment with 
six guns of heavy calibre, broke up camp on the 18th, marched 
to Fort Edward, where he rallied his troops, and, on the 19th, 
arrived at John s farm and took up a position in a fortified 
camp. 

The English, as usual, endeavored to lay the entire blame of 
the ill success of this expedition upon the Germans. Burgoyne 
had merely made a mistake in selecting only Germans for the 
attack on Bennirigton, since, in their opinion, they not only 
marched too slow but carried too much baggage. The English 
said that the hats and swords of the dragoons were as heavy 
as the whole equipment of a British soldier. It is true that 
justice was done to the bravery of Colonel Baum, but they also 
said that he did not possess the least knowledge of the country, 
its people, or its language. But who selected him for this 
expedition ? 



After the unsuccessful affair near Bennington, Riedesel re 
turned on the 18th of August, and took his family which had 
now arrived from Germany to John s farm. The general 
occupied a building called the Red House, in which, notwith 
standing the smallness of its size, he made himself comfortable 
with his wife and children. From the time of marching he 
was obliged to provide for his suite. His staff adjutants and 
officers ate with him at the same table. As the Red House 
contained only one room and a bed-chamber they dined out of 
doors in a barn, where tables and chairs were improvised for 
the occasion by boards laid across barrels. Provisions being 
scarce they often had bear meat. Madam Riedesel never had 



134 MAJOR GENERAL R1EDESEL 

cooked any such meat before, but she describes it as being very 
palatable, especially the paws. 1 

General Riedesel, having been ordered to hold this place, had 
it fortified as far as he was able, and caused the magazines at 
Fort Anne, to be removed thither as he thought that place could 
not be held. At that same time a few magazines were erected at 
Saratoga, and supplied with rations sufficient to last the troops 
three weeks. 

There were still eighty Brunswick dragoons with the army j 
this number being all that was left of the regiment. Riedesel, 
desirous of having them mounted as soon as possible, began by 
mounting thirty men ; for no more horses than that number 
could be had for the present. Meanwhile, almost all of the 
Indians had left for their homes, while the army was standing 
still. Very likely they did not find things as they expected, 
especially European discipline, which did not at all suit them. 
The excuse they gave was, that they must gather their harvest. 
They were chiefly of use to the army because the Americans 
wished to avail themselves of their services and their propensity for scalping. Indeed, as the Indians were mainly used as 
guards at the outposts, the rebels hardly ever dared to come 
near them, well knowing that the wild men were very cunning, 
and their eyes and ears very acute. This is proved by the fact 
that as soon as they had left, the enemy began to molest the 
outposts, and became very troublesome. 

The army being now provided with the most necessary 
articles, an advance was ordered. All the heavy baggage of 
the different regiments was sent back to Ticonderoga on the 1st 
of September. Those articles, however, which might be more 
needed, were only sent back as far as Diamond island in Lake 
George seven miles from Fort George that they might be 
close at hand in case of need. At the same time two companies

IN THE AMERICAN HE VOL UT1 ON. 135 

of the 47th Regiment were sent with them as a garrison ; only 
thirty men and one officer being left at Fort George, as the 
communication with that lake was to be given up for the 
present. In pursuance with this plan the two companies of the 
53d Regiment, which had been hitherto stationed at Fort 
George, were sent to Ticonderoga to reenforce that post. 

Meanwhile, the Americans troubled the outposts more and 
more. A few men, who had strayed beyond them, were captured ; 
and, on the 1st of September, an outpost of twenty Canadians 
and provincials was taken directly on Eraser s front. To put a 
stop to these proceedings and replace the Indians in some 
measure, General Fraser, on the 2d of September, issued an 
order that one non-commissioned officer and sixteen men should 
be furnished by each regiment to form a corps of yagers this 
body to be led by Captain Fraser. 

On the 3d, Riedesel left Fort George ! for the purpose of 
expediting the transports for the army. On his arrival, he 
found a document from the American General Gates, and also a 
few letters and lists written by Captain O Connell, who had been 
taken prisoner near Bennington. These papers were brought 
by Cornet Graef. Through them, the general learned the 
particulars of that engagement. Lieutenant Colonel Baum had 
died of his wounds two days after his capture, and been buried 
at Bennington with all military honors. Captain Reineking of 
the dragoons and Lieutenant Amiers of the grenadier battalion, 
had also died of their wounds at Bennington ; Lieutenant Boera 
and Cornet Stutzer were severely, and Chaplain Melzheimer, 
Lieutenant Gebhard and Ensign Specht slightly wounded ; and 
Ensigns Muchlenfield and Hagemann were shot. More than 



1 Fort George is still in a tolerable state of preservation, being, indeed, the best 
preserved of the revolutionary fortifications (excepting, perhaps, Fort Putnam) in 
existence. It lies almost sixty rods southeast of the present Fort William Hotel at 
Caldwell, Lake George. It was built to take the place of old Fort William Henry 
which was erected by Sir William Johnson and afterwards destroyed by Montcalm, 
in 1757. It was never the scene of an engagement, and was only used as a depot 
for military stores and as a connecting link between Ticonderoga and Fort Edward. 



13(3 MAJOR GENERAL R1EDE8EL 

one hundred of the Brunswickers, who had been severely 
wounded, were in the hospital at Bennington, and were well 
taken care of. Those who were at Albany had been taken 
northeast in the vicinity of Boston. The general also learned 
that of the eleven companies sent from England, seven had 
reached the army the same day (the 3d), and had been dis 
tributed among the different regiments. 

Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger, who had been sent some time 
since to the Mohawk river, was at first successful ; but the 
Americans, after their victory at Bennington taking fresh 
courage, and a strong American detachment advancing from 
Half Moon to Fort Stanwix, he was forced to relinquish all 
hopes of its capture ; and, after burying his cannon, he left the 
Mohawk and retreated to Oswego. The Hesse Hanau yagers 
together with a corps of Indians were with him. But upon his 
raising the siege, many of the latter left him and returned to 
their homes. About two hundred of them, however, reached 
the army on the 3d of September and offered their services, 
which were very welcome to the commanding general. As the 
captured Brunswick officers were in need of money, clothing 
and linen, Riedesel sent them one hundred guineas, besides 
other necessaries. The English surgeon, Wood, was selected to 
carry these articles to the prisoners, and Burgoyne ordered him, 
at the same time, to take along with him his instruments, 
medicines, etc., and pay special attention to the wounded. 

On the 7th, Burgoyne learned from an American deserter 
that the army, under General Gates, numbered between four 
teen and fifteen thousand men ; also, that that general was 
preparing to meet the royal Canadian army and attack it. The 
inhabitants of Albany had already received orders to drive their 
cattle into the back country, that the army of the enemy might 
be deprived of the means of subsistence should it reach that 
point. 

Three of the best generals served under Gates, viz : Schuy- 
ler, Arnold and Lincoln; of the brigadiers were mentioned

Glover, Stark and Whipple. The main army of the Americans 
was near Stillwater in a very advantageous position j while 
another corps of six thousand men was at Half Moon, at the 
junction of the Mohawk and Hudson ! rivers a very favorable 
situation for the support of the main body. 

On the 9th of September the artillery of the left wing, with 
the 47th Regiment, marched from John s farm - to Fort Ed 
ward. The same day, Burgoyne issued orders that the army 
should march the next day ] but hearing that the advance 
corps of the enemy was on the other side of the Hudson this 
side of the Fishkill, 3 he countermanded it. 

At seven o clock on the morning of the 10th, Riedesel started 
for Fort Edward with the rest of the left wing consisting of the 
regiments of Rhetz and Hesse Hauau. He had previously 
sent ahead a sufficient number of men with the light infantry to 
construct a pontoon bridge across the Hudson. 4 These troops 
took up a position this side the Fishkill on the 10th. They 
were under Captains Fraser, Monin, Boucherville, and Colonels 
Petersen and Yessop 3 of the provincials. Upon the approach 
of this body the enemy retreated, and immediately the advance 
corps of Brigadier Fraser and the reserved corps, under Brey-

4 The Brunswick Journal states, that as early as the 19th of August, a bridge was 
first made above the present Saratoga Falls or rapids ; but upon a better place being 
found lower down it was broken up and a new one built below the rapids. 

The exact place w r here the British crossed the Hudson was just below the Sara 
toga Falls, two miles above Schuylerville, about eighty rods northwest of the 
present residence of Abraham Yates Rogers. The entrenchments which were at 
that time thrown up to cover the passage of the river, are still to be seen very 
plainly. They are three hundred feet in length and from four to six feet in height, 
but are (1867) overgrown with scrub pines. Mr. Rogers, whose grandfather lived 
on the farm at the time, states that within thirty years the wooden platforms for 
the cannon were in existence behind the entrenchment. The survey for the rail 
road from Union village to Saratoga Springs, was through the entrenchments.

Glens Falls, are named.

mann, advanced to a point this side of the bridge. On the 
opposite bank of the river a small fort was erected for the 
defense of the bridge, and the protection of a few supplies 
deposited there. On the same day the artillery of the left 
wing, and Lieutenant Colonel Amstruther, with the 62d Regi- 
ment, reached the army. 

On the llth, the entire army started from Douart s l house 
and took up a position close in the rear of the reserved corps of 
Breymann in the immediate vicinity of the bridge all the 
artillery being sent to the left wing of the English regiments. 
Upon this, the rebel army retreated behind its advance guard, 
leaving Saratoga altogether. They sent, however, some detachments close to the English camp, and thus obliged the corps of 
Eraser and Breymann to remain the whole night under arms, 
and Burgoyne to throw up some entrenchments with the utmost 
haste. This day, Riedesel was very much occupied in trans 
porting stores from Fort George to Fort Edward, whence they 
were carried down the Hudson. 

Riedesel at first designed sending his family back into Canada; 
but was dissuaded by the prayers of his wife, who begged to be 
permitted to follow his fortunes the same as the other officers 
wives. The ladies followed in carriages a day s march behind 
the army, and got along as well as they could. General Bur 
goyne was so certain of victory that the ladies were in high 
spirits. When leaving, the vain man, with the utmost confi 
dence, exclaimed, " Britons never retreat ! " The prudent 
Madame Riedesel, however, was very much disgusted at Bur- 
goyne s never keeping his plans to himself; for all the ladies 
knew in advance what was to be done, and thus the enemy was 
always kept well informed by his spies. 

On the morning of the 12th, Riedesel, with the regiments of 
Rhetz and Hesse Hanau, left Fort Edward, to take up a position 



1 By some called Duer s house. This building stood in the present village of Fort 
Miller on the east side of the Hudson, about two miles and a half above where the 
troops crossed the river. 



IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. \ 39 

near Douart s house. The two English regiments, the 47th 
and 62d, departed at the same time and united with the army. 

At ten o clock on the morning of the 13th, lliedesel with his 
regiments again started and reached the left wing of the army 
the same day. The corps of Fraser also started the same day 
at seven in the morning and crossed the bridge, 1 taking a position on an eminence this side of the Fislikill. - 2 The reserves of 
Breymann followed at nine o clock, covering the left wing of 
Fraser s corps. After crossing the bridge the artillery remained 
on the Hudson ; the 9th, 20th, 21st and 62d Regiments en 
camped on the plain near the river between the barracks l and 
the Fishkill and the six companies of the 47th, covered the 
bateaux on the right bank of the river. All the German troops 
of the left wing remained on this side of the river. The hos- 



1 The Brunswick Journal, in speaking of the passage of this bridge, says ; " The 
avant-guarde, under Fraser was the first to march over. At nine o clock the reserve 
under Lieutenant Colonel Breymann followed after them, in order to cover, in the 
first place, Fraser s left flank. The Germans who formed the left wing of the 
army went over last of all. As soon as the last man had crossed the bridge it was 
broken up. They had passed the Rubicon, and all further communication with 
Canada was now cut off. The army which, on first setting off from there, was 
10.000 strong, had already diminished to (i.000, and even these were provided with 
provisions not only scant in quantity, but bad in quality. 

When the army had crossed the river, those of the Brunswick dragoons, that 
were left, were mounted. These amounted to only some twenty men, and now 
formed the entire cavalry of the army, and even these few were very poorly 
equipped. 1

ver, whose father was in the battle of Saratoga, and assisted in the execution of 
Lovejace the tory. The translator is under much obligation to both Mr. Strover and 
his son-in-law, Dr. C. H. Payne, for their assistance in pointing out to him the 
localities. 

Schuyler s house (so says the manuscript journals of the German officers) was 
between the old village of Saratoga and the Fishkill. This fact is of great importance in locating the old village, which, by the way, at best consisted of only a 
few scattered houses. 

3 These barracks were located on the north side of the road to Saratoga Springs, 
directly upon the present site of the red barns of the Hon. Alonzo Welsh of Schuy- 
lerville, who (1867) resides a few rods east of the barns on the main village street. 
The barracks were standing and occupied by a farmer up to within twenty years. 
In March, 1867, Mr. Welsh, while ploughing back of his barns came across the 
burying place of the hospital. The bones thus exhumed he carefully reburied. 
pital was at the barrack, and General Burgoyne took up his head 
quarters in a house on the other side of the Fishkill belonging 
to General Schuyler. The head quarters were guarded by two 
hundred men. 

The hills around Saratoga were so covered with woods and 
underbrush that it was impossible to place the army in a position to withstand an attack from the enemy. All of the gene 
rals carefully inspected the hills nearest to the camp, and agreed 
upon a position in case of the enemy making their appearance. 
All the colonels were notified of this. The situation of the 
army, moreover, was rendered additionally precarious by the 
fact that it was separated by the river, and was thus obliged to 
be constantly on its guard. New embankments were therefore 
thrown up, and strong outposts placed in every direction, especially on the side toward Bennington. Meanwhile, the Americans 
had retreated into their fortified camp near Stillwater, distant 
about six miles from the English army. They had not disturbed 
the latter on the passage up the river. General Burgoyne burned 
with impatience to advance on the enemy. Accordingly, the very 
moment that all the baggage had crossed the bridge, and the 
fact was told him, he gave orders at eleven o clock on the 
morning of the 13th, that, at one o clock, the army should 
advance. The corps of Brigadier Fraser formed the advance 
guard ; then followed the army in three columns. The four 
English regiments, under Brigadier Hamilton, and constituting 
the first column, were to inarch toward the right. The second 
column was made up of all the artillery. The German troops, 
as the third column, were to march to Stillwater and remain on 
the west side of the Hudson. The baggage was to remain in 
the rear, and the hospital and supplies to follow after the heavy 
artillery, under the escort of six companies of the 47th Regi 
ment. The corps of Breymann was ordered to remain on the 
bridge and to destroy it as soon as the left wing had crossed 
over. Henceforth, this corps was to form the rear guard of the 
whole army. The regiments began the advance at the sound 



IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. \\ 

of music, in the best of spirits. The entire army defiled in 
front of General Burgoyne who was on the other side of the 
river with his suite. In consequence of the road being in bad 
condition, the order for marching was altered, so that the whole 
of the infantry formed only one column, while marching on the 
shore of the river. But shortly before reaching the new camp 
the army marched in two columns. The centre of the army 
soon came to Dovogat s house which the commander in chief at 
once selected as his head quarters. The left wing rested on the 
Hudson ; the right on marshy ground ; the front was covered 
by the Cumniings kill which here empties into the river. Fraser, 
with his corps, was with the right wing ; and the regiment of 
Rhetz and the 47th English were so placed in the left wing, 
that the chain of the pickets was on the rear of the left wing in 
connection with the reserved corps of Breymann. For the 
defense of the baggage, which, it will be remembered, was ^nder 
the protection of the 47th, two more twelve pounders were 
detached. The spot, occupied this day by the army, had been 
used only the day previous, as the camp of four hundred Ameri 
cans. The camps of both armies were about five English miles 
distant from each other, so that at eight o clock on the morning 
of the 16th, the roll call of the Americans could be distinctly 
heard in the English camp. It was believed in the British 
army, that the Americans had approached nearer ; and in order 
to be certain in regard to this, as well as the position of their 
army, Burgoyne himself sallied out to reconnoitre. Two roads 
for the two columns were also to be made at the same time, and 
a bridge, that had been destroyed by the Americans, was to be 
repaired in order to facilitate the advance of the army. A part 
of the light troops, consisting of one-half of Eraser s corps, and 
the second brigade of the two wings with six guns, were detached for this purpose. The 9th and the 62d, of the right wing, 
under Lieutenant Colonel Amstruther, and the regiments of 
Specht and Hesse Hanau of the left wing under Brigadier Gall, 
were also detached for the same purpose. 
At eleven o clock on the morning of the 16th, the corps left 
the camp accompanied by Burgoyne, Phillips, Riedesel and 
Fraser. Two divisions of working men, each one hundred strong, 
with the necessary tools, followed the corps. The column of 
the right wing consisted of one-half of Fraser s corps, under 
Major Ackland, and the regiment Specht ; the column of the 
left, of the 9th, 62d and Hesse Hanau. The former crossed a 
ruined bridge, which had now been repaired, and came to a 
road leading to Dovogat s house, just below the Cummings kill. 
The latter, after crossing the bridge, took the road leading to 
Sword s house.- Both houses were about two and a half English miles- distant from the British camp. The generals were 
obliged, on account of the detention caused by the repairing of 
the bridge, to discontinue reeonnoitering for this day. Toward 
evening they reached the two houses above mentioned, which 
were about eight hundred paces distant from each other and 
separated by dense woods. At eight o clock in the evening 
the corps returned to their camp, without seeing anything of 
the enemy. On the following day (the 17th), at ten o clock in 
the morning, the army again started in two columns, taking the 
two roads that had been made the day previous. The right 
column was composed of Fraser s brigade and the English 
regiments of the right wing ; the left, of all the German troops 
of the left wing. Behind these followed the heavy artillery, 



1 This house, which is still (1867) standing in good preservation, on the margin 
of the Lake Champlain canal about fifty rods from the Hudson, is situated forty 
rods east of the road from Schuylerville to Stillwater, in what is called Van 
Vechten s cove at Coveville. It is owned by Mr. Wilcox, the president of the 
Schuylerville bank, and is at present tenanted by an Irishman of the name of 
Patrick Mohan. 

2 The site of this house, is on the south bank of a spring brook, about fifty yards 
west of the Hudson river, and a few rods north of the south line of the town of 
Saratoga. It may be readily found from being about thirty rods north of a high 
way leading from the Hudson river road westerly, which highway is the first one 
north of Wilbur s basin. This highway, was nearly the same at the time of General Burgoyne s visit in 1777, as it is now. It was on land, now (1867) owned by a 
Mr. Chase, about three miles south of Schuylerville. All traces of it are now 
obliterated, save a slight depression in the soil, where was the cellar. 



AV THE A MEXICAN EEVOL IJTION. \ 43 

the hospitals, stores, and all the baggage of the army. The 
corps of Breymann again formed the rear guard. At six in 
the evening the army encamped near Sword s house, extending 
back to Dovogat s house. The camp was on an eminence. In 
advance, among the hills, stood Eraser s corps j and in the rear, 
toward the plain, bivouacked Specht s brigade in line. Brey- 
mann s division reached the main army at one o clock in the 
night, and encamped fifteen hundred paces in the rear of 
Specht s brigade. In the space between Breymann s corps and 
Specht s brigade were artillery, trains, supplies, etc. ] the latter 
brigade extending as far as the Hudson. The bateaux, with 
their freight, were also here. A deserter reported that the 
Americans had left their camp near Stillwater three miles 
distant, in order to attack the English army. Burgoyne 
accordingly reenforced the outposts, and gave orders that the 
next morning before daybreak the army should be under arms. 
The night, however, passed quietly still no particulars of the 
enemy s position among the hills were as yet known. Brey 
mann s corps, for the sake of safety, advanced to the right wing 
close to the division of Fraser. lliedesel, in turn, then advanced to the position just left by Breymann. The regiment 
Rhetz occupied the bridge between Sword s house arid the 
English regiments of the right wing. At this point, a footpath 
led from Stillwater across the mountains. 

The Americans had destroyed all the bridges, and the roads 
were consequently impassable for an army. Burgoyne, there 
fore, could advance no farther. On the 18th, he caused some 
roads to be cut through the woods, and, at the same time, had 
a few earth works thrown up to cover the army in the rear. 
The road along the bank of the Hudson was entirely destroyed 
by the Americans ; and as the left wing, artillery and baggage 
were to advance in this direction, the road and the buried 
bridges had also to be repaired. lliedesel superintended this 
work himself, and this, too, in the presence of the enemy who 
were on the opposite bank. By two o clock in the afternoon, 
two bridges were repaired, and a new one, designated No. I, 1 
built. Here was left a picket of two hundred men. The enemy 
made several movements toward the left wing, which occupied 
more ground and had progressed more rapidly with its work 
than the right. All unnecessary firing was forbidden in the 
English army. Everything remained quiet. 

Toward four in the afternoon, four regiments of the enemy, 
with banners, could plainly be seen. Three were hidden be 
hind the hills, and two behind some woods on the plain. 

The night passed quietly, although the English army were 
ready at any moment for battle, and were under arms an hour 
before daybreak. Riedesel, who was the more cautious, as he 
expected that the left wing would be first attacked, ordered two 
companies of his regiment, two hours before day, to advance 
and occupy a position between the left wing and the picket on 
the bridge. All the patrols, who returned in the morning, 
reported that they had seen nothing of the enemy. Burgoyne, 
therefore, determined upon an advance ; and, as a preparatory 
step, once more divided his army into three columns. The first 
or centre column, consisting of the 9th, 20th, 21st and 62d 
Regiments with six six-pounders, was led by Brigadier Hamil 
ton ; the second or right column, consisting of the English 
grenadiers and light infantry, the 24th Brunswick grenadiers, 
and the light battalion with eight six-pounders under Lieutenant 
Colonel Breymann, was led by General Eraser; and the third 
or left column, which was to advance on the main road and 
consisted of the rest of the German troops and the artillery of 
the left wing, was led by General Riedesel. General Burgoyne 
remained with the column of Brigadier Hamilton. The heavy 
artillery, baggage, etc., followed the column commanded by 
Riedesel. The 47th Regiment remained on the right bank of 
the Hudson for the protection of the bateaux.

known as Van Buren s ferry, directly opposite the village of Easton. It is still 
quite a stream. 



AY THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION 145 

On the 19th of September, the army began its preparations 
for the march by forming into three columns. The Hesse 
Hanau regiment was directed by Iliedescl to occupy the hills 
on either side of Sword s house and defend the roads leading 
into the woods behind this house. It was further ordered to 
remain in this position until the troops of the left wing had 
passed, when it was to form the rear guard. At eleven o clock, 
upon the discharge of a signal gun in the centre, the advance 
guards of the three columns started. l The advance guard of the 
left wing was formed by part of the dragoons, and a detachment 
of one hundred men of the light infantry. Then followed the 
regiment Riedesel, a detachment of working men and the 
artillery of the left wing, the regiment Rhetz, and, last of all, 
the regiment Specht. The column crossed new bridge No. 1, 
and, after passing Taylor s house,- halted at a distance of about 
eight hundred paces from the latter. At this point it was 



1 The reverberations of this signal gun among the hills is described in several 
manuscript journals as particularly grand. 

2 Taylor s house the one in which General Fraser is supposed to have died 
was situated three miles and a half south of Fish creek, and about one hundred 
rods north of Wilbur s basin. At the time of the battle it stood by the side of the 
old road on the w r est margin of the intervales at the foot of the hill on which General Fraser was buried. When, some years afterwards, the present turnpike was 
constructed, running twenty rods east of the old road, the latter was discontinued, 
and a Mr. Smith (who had purchased the old house), drew it to the west side of 
the turnpike and turned it into a tavern. Hence it was long known as the Smith 
house. It stood until within five years, when it was torn down. The foundations 
yet (1867) remain on ground now owned by Cotton & Sons. In 1820, the late 
Theodore Dwight visited the spot, and made a drawing of it, which has been en 
graved and given in The Letters and Journals of Mrs. General Riedesel. 

It is generally believed that the Taylor house was the one in which General Fra 
ser died. This, however, I believe to be a mistake, and for the following reason : 
Whenever any incident occurs at or near Taylor s house it is always spoken of in 
the manuscript journals of the German officers as having occurred at or near Tay 
lor s house. But when speaking of the prominent event of Fraser s death, he is said 
to have been carried into the log house occupied by Mrs. Riedesel. This opinion, 
moreover, seems to receive confirmation in the fact that on the original maps of 
this action, three houses are put down on the locality where Taylor s house stood. 

Neither was the Taylor house at any time the head quarters of Burgoyne, as has 
also been heretofore believed. General Burgoyne s head quarters, after leaving 
Sword s house, was in the centre of the army on Freeman s farm.

necessary to build a new bridge across a marshy ditch, which, 
when completed, was known as bridge No. 2. 1 The men at 
once fell to work, under the protection of the regiment Kied- 
esel ; the other regiments meanwhile sending out patrols as far 
forward as possible. Toward one o clock in the afternoon a 
brisk fire of musketry was heard at a considerable distance off. 
It continued to be heard for half an hour, and was supposed to 
proceed from the second column. In the meantime the work 
men continued their operations on the left wing. Finally 
Riedesel ordered the regiment Rhetz close up to his own 
regiment, that it might be near at hand in case of need. At 
the same time he ordered two companies, under Captain Fred- 
ersdorf, to push forward to the other side of the ditch, when it. 
would be in more easy communication with the centre column. 
General Phillips, who commanded the heavy artillery, and had 
hitherto followed the left column, offered to go back to the 
second column and investigate into the cause of the late firing. 
Not deeming it prudent to take the nearest way through the 
woods he rode back, and followed in the track of the right or 
second column. As soon as the bridge was finished, Eiedesel 
informed the different colonels of it by a signal. He then advanced across the bridge ; but scarcely had he gone six hundred 
paces when he was obliged to build another one (called No. 
3 -), in consequence of which the army were again brought to 



1 This bridge was over the creek that ran into the Hudson at a place now called 
Wilbur s basin, about one hundred rods south of the Taylor or Smith house. 
At this time it was quite a large stream, but having been directed into the Cham- 
plain canal, it is now only a muddy ditch. The land on which this is, is now 
owned by Mr. Hoag. 

2 This bridge, according to the Brunswick Journal * before quoted, was about 
1,500 feet south of bridge No. 2 (Wilbur s Basin), fifteen feet north of the first 
canal bridge south of Wilbur s basin. Its site is now occupied by the Champlain 
canal. The Journal says, " The left column resumed its march (from bridge No. 
2), but had scarcely advanced 600 paces t when they were compelled to halt again 
and repair a bridge which had been demolished, etc." This point is an important 
one, from the fact that it was the extreme southern limit on the river bank, reached 
by Burgoyne s army in his expedition.

a halt. The advance guard, the workmen and the party de 
tailed for the protection of the left wing were, however, relieved 
thus advancing the regiment Rhetz to the position lately held 
by the regiment lliedesel, the latter occupying the heights 
around Taylor s house on the other side of the ditch, and those 
in the woods on the cross road where Captain Fredersdorf stood 
with his two companies. For the defense of bridge No. 2, two 
twelve-pounders were brought into position, the six-pounders 
having been taken by the regiment Rhetz for the protection of 
the working party. 

Toward two o clock in the afternoon Major Bloomfiel 1 of the 
artillery returned. He had accompanied Phillips on his recon- 
noitering expedition, and had now been sent back by him to 
Riedesel with the report that the Brunswick light troops be 
longing to the advance guard of the right wing were already 
hotly engaged with the enemy, that the latter were drawn up 
in order of battle, and that a general engagement would take 
place that very afternoon. Major Bloomfield was accordingly 
directed to bring back with him a few heavy guns from the 
artillery train, for the support of the right wing ; but scarcely 
had he left, when the fire of musketry began anew. Riedesel, 
having as yet heard nothing from Burgoyne, 1 immediately dis 
patched Captain Willoe to the latter, at the same time posting 
his men so that he could not be taken by surprise. It was of 
the utmost importance that the ground between bridges Nos. 
1 and 2 should be held, as upon that depended the salvation of 
the entire army. Here were the artillery and* the supply train;

would make the distance from bridge No. 2, to bridge No. 3, about 1,500 feet as 
stated above.] 

1 The reader will bear in mind that Burgoyne had advanced toward Freeman s 
farm with the first or centre column, under Brigadier Hamilton. 
in fact, here, near Taylor s house, was the main position. This 
point was occupied by the regiment Riedesel, which had for its 
support two six-pounders, under Captain Pausch, posted in an 
advantageous position, a little in advance. Some Indians, run 
ning across the woods and mountains from the right wing, 
reported that a few regiments of the enemy had marched to 
within a short distance of the left wing. This story, moreover, 
was the more credible, as some rebel patrols, who had been 
seen on the plain, had shot the horse of a dragoon while acting 
as sentry. In the meantime the firing lasted until live o clock 
in the afternoon, when Captain Willoe returned with a message 
from Burgoyne to the eifect that Riedesel, after reenforcing his 
position near the river as much as possible, should take the 
rest of his troops and attack the flank of the enemy near Free 
man s farm. 1 Riedesel, accordingly, immediately selected for 
this purpose two companies from the regiment Rhetz, and the 
whole of his own regiment, together with two cannons their 
places being filled by the remaining three companies of the 
regiment Rhetz. Leaving Brigadier Specht with the 47th and 
the heavy artillery in command on the river, Riedesel took 
the road behind bridge No. 2, and crossed the new one No. 3, 
leading to the plain. Here he stationed a guard. After crossing the bridge, he hastened, with two companies of the regiment 
Rhetz as an advanced guard, as quickly as possible on a road, 
one and a half English miles long, through the woods till he 
arrived on an eminence, from the top of which he could see the 
engagement of the right wing. The enemy were posted on a 
corner ftf the woods, having on his right flank for a defense a 
deep muddy ditch, the bank of which had been rendered inac 
cessible by stones, underbrush and barricades. In front of this 
corner of the forest, and entirely surrounded by dense woods, 
was a vacant space, on which the English regiments were

owned and occupied (1867) by a farmer of the name of Ebenezer Leggett, 



JJ\ T THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. \Ay 

drawn up in line. The struggle was for the possession of this 
vacant space, on which, by the way, Freeman s farm was situ 
ated. It had already been in possession of both parties, and 
now served as a support for the left flank of the English right 
wing, the right flank being covered by the corps of Fraser and 
Breymann. The 9th served as a reserve. 

When General Riedesel arrived on the eminence, the battle 
was raging the fiercest. The Americans, far superior in num 
bers, had,, for the sixth time, hurled fresh troops against the 
three English regiments the 20th, 21st and 62d. The guns 
on this wing were already silenced, there being no more ammunition and all the artillerymen having been either killed or 
wounded. The three brave English regiments had been, by 
the steady fire of fresh relays of the enemy, thinned down to 
one-half, and now formed a small band surrounded by heaps of 
dead and wounded. This was the scene presented to the view 
of Riedesel on his arrival on the height. Every moment he 
expected to see the little band either captured or annihilated 
by the Americans. Quickly, and without waiting for the rest 
of his troops with drums beating and his men shouting 
"hurrah!" he attacked the enemy on the double quick. 
Posting his troops at the edge of the above mentioned ditch, he 
sent such a well directed volley among the Americans, that 
those troops who were coming out of the woods, and about to 
fall upon the English, were startled and turned back. The 
British, animated with fresh courage, pressed forward at the 
point of the bayonet. Meanwhile, Captain Pausch arrived with 
his guns at the right moment, and forming into line with the 
English, opened fire with grape shot. The regiment Riedesel 
also arrived at the nick of time, and, joining the two companies 
on the ditch, considerably extended the line of fire. 

The English had thrown a bridge across the ditch for the 
purpose of keeping up the necessary connection with the left 
wing. General Riedesel, therefore, after posting his two com 
panies on the edge of the ditch, galloped toward the bridge, in 



150 MAJOR GENERAL RIEDE8EL 

order to confer with Generals Burgoyne and Phillips. Thence 
he sent orders to his troops to do their best to cross the ditch 
and unite with the English. The Brunswickers, having succeeded in spite of its apparent impossibility in accomplishing 
this feat, immediately poured another volley of musketry into 
the enemy s flank, accompanying it with a " hurrah ! " This 
was the turning point ; for the English and Germans, throwing 
themselves upon the enemy in the woods, repulsed them. 
Scarcely, however, was the engagement over in this, quarter, 
when firing began again on the right. A few American bri 
gades had endeavored to surround the right wing, but Lieutenant 
Colonel Breymann, being on his guard, received them with a 
vigorous fire, and compelled them to retreat after a few dis 
charges. General Fraser, who was a witness of this, gives the 
most splendid acknowledgments to the German troops in a 
general circular to all the English generals. 

Only one hundred of the enemy s dead were on the battle 
field at the close of the engagement ; for he had had time and 
opportunity to remove most of his killed and wounded. Deserters 
reported that the Americans had had their whole force engaged, 
having left only eight hundred men to garrison their camp. 
They were commanded on this occasion by General Arnold. 
The English and Germans remained during the night on the 
battle field. Kiedesel, however, returned at nine in the evening 
to the left wing which he found encamped. The Hesse Hanau 
regiment was ordered to quit its position on the cross road, and 
take up another one near bridge No 2, hitherto occupied by 
the regiment Specht the latter, with two cannon, moving on to 
the height where the three companies of the regiment Rhetz had 
until now been stationed. 

Thus had General Riedesel, with his German troops, once more 
saved the English from a great misfortune, having unquestionably 
decided the engagement in their favor. Notwithstanding, how 
ever, the praise which the German troops received for their 
bravery on this occasion, General Burgoyne, and a few other 



IN THE A MEIiICA JV RE VOL UTION. \\ 

English commanders, regarded the German general with secret 
envy. Indeed, they would gladly have passed over his merits, 
had such a thing been possible. British pride did not desire 
the acknowledgment of bravery other than their own, as we 
shall see more plainly in the future. 1 

General Burgoyne resolved, after this engagement, to advance 
no farther for the present, but to await the movements of 
General Howe for the union of both armies. He concluded, 
therefore, to post his army in such a position, that while it 
would be secure from an attack, it might be free to undertake 
other operations. Accordingly, on the 20th, he inspected, with 
his other generals, the entire region of country which had been 
hitherto occupied by his three columns. The result of this 
inspection was the posting of the army from Freeman s farm 
across the woods and hills as far as Taylor s house, in front of 
bridge No. 2, and thence to the Hudson. At the same time 
for the defense of the right wing, a redoubt was thrown up on 
the late battle field near the corner of the woods, that had been 
occupied by the enemy, this side of the ditch. The defense of 
this ditch was entrusted to the corps of Eraser, who were to 
occupy the same position that the Germans had done on the day 
of the battle. The reserve corps of Breymann was posted the 
other side of the ditch, both for the protection of the right flank 



1 In St&lt;jdman s History of the American War we find the best evidences of the 
statement in the text. In describing this engagement, for instance, he makes not 
the least mention of General Riedesel and his flank attack. " The surrounding of 
the right wing," he says, " was frustrated by General Fraser." He further adds, 
" The German troops, in consequence of their position, the leaving of which was 
not considered advisable, did not take a great part in this engagement. After the 
commencement of this action, General Phillips made his way through the dense 
woods, a proceeding that was of great advantage. 1 We will not make any further 
explanations, but leave it to the decision of the reader. Note in the original. 

Mrs. General Riedesel, with a few of the officers wives, who had followed the 
army, was near the field of action, and knew that their husbands were in the contest. 
It was the first time she had stood this test ; and, notwithstanding her courage, she 
suffered the most intense anguish during these trying hours. She has described 
her situation very graphically and in detail in her Letters and Journals, to which

of Fraser s division and for the defense of a road leading from 
this point to the rear of the army. The right wing of the English brigade was placed in close proximity to the left wing of 
Fraser, thus extending the line to the left as far as bridge No. 
2. The road, on which Riedesel had hastened to the succor of 
the British, the previous day, was therefore now in the rear of 
the army. The left wing was also extended to a considerable 
eminence. The Hesse Hanau regiment kept its position on the 
cross road behind bridge No. 2. The 47th and the corps of pro 
vincials remained in its old position for the defense of the 
ground between bridges No. 2, and No. 3, 1 where the artillery 
and supply trains were placed. General Burgoyne took up his 
head quarters in the centre of the army. The entire front was 
covered by a deep, muddy ditch running nine hundred paces in 
front of the outposts of the left wing, but, at the same time, 
being so near the centre, that the outposts were on the farther 
side. This ditch ran in a curve around the right wing of the 
English brigade, thereby separating Fraser s corps from the 
main body. The space between them was filled up with 
artillery and a few detachments. Near the water, about four 
hundred paces from bridge No. 3, was a corner of the forest 
extending down the hills, behind which the enemy had his 
outposts. There was also a detachment of the Hesse Hanau 
regiment stationed behind some embankments, for the de 
fense of bridge No. 3. This was the new camp of Freeman s 
farm.- 

The beating of the reveille in the enemy s camp could be

2 The following, also, is the description of the forces as given in the Auxiliaries 
taken from the Brunswick Journal. Although it does not differ essentially from 
the one in the text (taken from General Riedesel s Journal) it furnishes additional 
details, besides proving most conclusively the falsity of the statement generally 
made, that Burgoyne s head quarters were at Taylor s house. Vide note on the 
Taylor or Smith house a few pages back. 

" The encampment, after the action, extended from Freeman s farm through the 
forest,"over the ridge of a hill up to the height behind Taylor s house ; and from 
the bridge No. 2, down to the Hudson. On the right wing, near the ravine, where

heard by the left wing, wlience it was conjectured that their 
right wing could not be far distant from the ditch near the 
camp of the Germans. The Americans were, therefore, nearer 
to the latter than to the English. In order, however, to ascertain the position of the enemy with more certainty as well as to 
force them, by a movement of the left wing, to vacate this side, 
the English general, at daybreak of the 21st, ordered one thou 
sand working men, under the supervision of two engineers, to 
cut a road through the woods in the direction where the Ame 
ricans were supposed to be encamped. The same number of 



the engagement of the preceding clay had taken place, a redoubt was thrown up. 
Fraser s corps was also stationed there, that is to say, on the spot, where, during 
the action, Riedesel s seven companies had been placed. On the other side of the 
ravine stood the reserve under Breymann, to cover the right flank.* Behind Fra- 
ser s left flank the right wing of the British brigades began, and thence the entire 
line of the army stretched across the hills up to Taylor s house before bridge No. 2. 
On the left wing there was a height from which the entire breadth of the valley 
from the river up to bridge No. 3 could be swept by shot. The regiment of Hesse 
Hanau was to keep its position in the valley on the cross road behind bridge No. 2, 
having its outermost posts near the bridge No. 3. The 47th Regiment and the corps 
of provincials, together with the few Indians that still remained with the army 
were also directed to defend the valley, and were stationed between the bridges 1 
and 2, where the train and hospitals were also placed. 

" Burgoyne camped between the English and German troops of Riedesd on the 
heights at the left wing. The entire front was protected by a deep, marshy difch, 
with an undergrowth of wood along its side ; said ditch running close to the line 
in the centre and winding off around the right flank, so that it cut its way between 
said flank and Fraser s division. The empty space left in this manner, was 
covered by guards and batteries. To the left the ditch lost itself in the valley near 
the declivity of the hills, at the distance of 300 paces on the other side of the chain 
of sentries. Behind the ditch, palisades and barricades of immense trees, cut down, 
rose up for trees were close at hand. In the valley, about 400 paces beyond the 
outer bridge No. 3, the angle of a forest extended along the Hudson, and ran 
through the hollow as far up as the declivity of the hill, and behind said angle or 
edge of the forest, the Americans had stationed their most advanced outposts in 
the valley. To protect the bridge No. 3, one officer and forty men of the Hesse 
Hanau regiment stood entrenched on the road, with a subaltern guard of ten men 
posted at some distance before them in a house with loop holes. Each regiment 
had to detach one picket, which was stationed 1,000 paces in advance of its front ; 
and between said picket and the camp were the outposts. For the protection of 
these outposts triangular redoubts were thrown up. Such, pretty nearly, was the 
disposition of the camp at FREEMAN S FARM. 

[* This spot is now called by the farmers BURGOYNE S HILL. See note some 
pages in advance.] 

20 
troops from the centre, and as many more from the left wing 
accompanied this party as a guard. The working party, after 
making a road on the left wing as far as the ditch, were at 
tacked by a force of one hundred rebels, who, however, were 
driven back. But the tumult, thus occasioned, caused Bur- 
goyne to call the army to arms, in which position it remained 
two hours. As soon as all was again quiet, the army returned 
into its camp. 

It was a very difficult task for the English commander to fill up 
the thinned ranks of those three English regiments that had borne 
the brunt of the last engagement. He finally determined, for 
the present at least, until reenforcements arrived, to fill up their 
ranks with provincials, having first gained the consent of their 
commanders, Captains Peterson, Yessop, Makelzy, and McKay, 
to the step, upon giving them a written promise that their men 
should be dismissed by the 25th of the December following. 

During the interval between the 21st and the 22d, a pontoon 
bridge was constructed alongside of bridge No. 2, under the 
direction of Captain Schenck. This was done to facilitate the 
communication of the army with the opposite bank. During 
the night, considerable noise and hallooing was heard in the 
Afuerican camp. This, in connection with the fact that at six 
o clock of the previous evening firing had been heard, led the 
army to suppose that some holiday was being celebrated. On 
the morning of the 22d, some loyal Albanians reached the army. 
The next morning the army received orders to be under arms 
every morning one hour before dawn as long as it remained in its 
present camp. A courier from General Howe arrived the same 
day with dispatches to Burgoyne, which the latter kept secret. 
Riedesel, however, learned among other things, that Howe had 
sent a corps up the Hudson in ships, under the* command of 
General Clinton, for the purpose of getting in the rear of the 
Americans ; also, that Howe promised to send some more news 
in about eight days. 

The work of fortifying the camp was continued daily. On 



AV THE AMERICAN EEVOL UTION. 155 

the 23d, a phtcc &lt;.r&lt;irmes was laid out in front of the regi 
ments, which was also fortified as much as possible and 
strengthened with batteries, the army having abundance of 
artillery. In front of the line in the woods, trees were felled 
to within a distance of one hundred paces; while between 
bridges Nos. 1 and 2, large embankments and redoubts were 
thrown up. More than one thousand men were employed for 
fourteen days on this work. In the night of the 23d, a great 
deal of noise was again heard in the American camp. This 
time, however, it may have proceeded from working parties, as 
the most common noise was the rattling of teams. From the 
fact, also, that human voices were heard, it is evident that the 
enemy must have been very near the other side of the ditch. 
Indeed, detachments of the enemy came close to the outposts, 
but were driven back by the patrols. 

On the 23d, Burgoyne sent the Brunswick Captain, Gerlach, 
with a strong detachment^ of provincials, on a reconnoitering 
expedition, to the opposite bank of the Hudson, for the purpose 
of ascertaining more exactly the real position of the enemy. 
He was to ascertain especially, if something could not be done 
against the enemy s right wing, provided the roads were in a 
suitable condition. He returned in the evening, and reported 
that he had been beyond the right wing of the Americans, but 
could not find out their position, otherwise than that he sup 
posed they were encamped in two lines. According, also, to 
his report, they had no bridge across the river, but a ferry four 
miles in their rear. 

On the morning of this day (the 23d) the outposts of the 
left wing and of the corps of Fraser and Breymann were 
attacked by a larger force than on the previous occasion. In a 
skirmish near the water, the enemy were repulsed, though with a 
loss of three men. Several of the Americans were also wounded ; 
and a patrol of the regiment Khetz brought in four prisoners. 
The same morning the wagons in which Riedesel had sent clothing to those Brunswick officers who had been captured, returned 
at ten o clock. General Gates gave the servant of the late Lieu 
tenant Colonel Baum his liberty ; a circumstance which caused 
the man to break forth in such laudations in the camp, that it 
was feared the fellow might induce some of the soldiers to desert. 
He said that the sick and wounded prisoners were still in Ben- 
nington, but the well ones had been taken to Springfield. A few 
loyal Albanians, who arrived at this time in the camp, reported 
that General Howe had lately gained some advantage over Wash- 
nington, whose army was near its dissolution. A deserter, who 
soon after came into camp, confirmed this report. 

The noises in the American camp continued the following 
night, and the outposts were again troubled. On the morning 
of the 26th, Burgoyne sent an officer, with a detachment of 
Indians and light troops, in the direction of the enemy by a 
circuitous way. This officer succeeded in gaining the rear of 
the Americans, but failed to learn anything of their position. 
He came across a party of the enemy which he repulsed ; and 
the Indians, as usual, brought in a few scalps. The description 
given by the servant of the late Lieutenant Colonel Baum, in 
regard to the amiable and pleasant deportment of General Gates, 
was in no wise extravagant. The latter soon gave another proof 
of this. The captured cornet, Graef, of the dragoons, soon after 
arrived, on the morning of the 28th, on the outskirts of the 
camp, in the company of Colonel Wilkinson, the adjutant 
general of General Gates. The former only was admitted. 
The object of Wilkinson s visit was to see about the exchange 
of a captured American colonel. In this, however, he was 
unsuccessful, as the colonel was then in England. General 
Gates wrote an extremely polite and agreeable letter to Bur 
goyne and Riedesel, and allowed Cornet Graef to remain five 
days in the English camp. Horatio Gates was a native of 
England, had formerly been in the British service, and had 
distinguished himself at the capture of Martinique. 1 He after-

ward left the army, went to America, and bought land in 
Virginia. Upon the breaking out of the rebellion in 1775, he 
entered the American service, and found another opportunity 
of using his military talents. He was a man of high culture, 
and very amiable. We shall soon speak further of this general. 

Many things, hitherto unknown, were gathered from Grraef. 
Among other items, he stated that a short time since the Ame 
ricans, under General Lincoln, had attempted to surprise the 
two forts at^Ticonderoga. In their main object they had been 
unsuccessful, though they had captured four companies of the 
53d, besides driving an officer arid his men out of a log house, 
and getting possession of a ship and one bateau. This was 
the occasion of the firing and noise heard in the enemy s camp 
during the night of the 21st. 1 

At nine in the evening of the same day (the 28th) an out 
post of the Hesse Hanau regiment near the river was surprised 
and driven back by a party of fifty men who had come suddenly 
upon them through a field of corn ; but being at once reenforced, 
they forced the Americans to retreat, and reoccupied their former 
position. 

The situation of General Burgoyne already began to grow 
dangerous. The outposts were more and more molested ; the 
army was weakened by sick, wounded, and the sending off of 
detachments ; the enemy swarmed in its rear, threatening the 
strongest positions ; the army was as good as cut off from its 
outposts; while in addition to all this, in consequence of the 
close proximity of the enemy s camp, the soldiers had but little 
rest. To prevent unnecessary alarms as far as possible, Bur 
goyne ordered the two generals,- commanding the two wings, 
to station an adjutant at each outpost, under whom should be 
the patrols. An alarm was then only to be given when one of

indebted to an enemy in his front for information respecting his own posts in his 
rear. Did his Indian scouts play him false, or was it bad generalship ? 

2 Brigadier Hamilton of the right, and General Riedesel of the left wing. 
these adjutants thought it necessary. Accordingly a staff officer 
was dispatched during the day for the purpose. But that which 
weakened the army still more, was the growing desertions. The 
Americans had sent agents into the English camp who endea 
vored to induce the soldiers, by all kinds of representations, to 
desert; and it being already known that the Americans treated 
their prisoners very kindly, and that they were not as strict in 
their discipline as the Europeans, the agents here and there 
found a willing ear. The want, moreover, of everything to 
which the English soldier especially, was accustomed, and the 
hard service, made matters worse yet. There were already, 
besides the sick who were with the regiment, eight hundred 
men in the hospital, the most of whom were wounded. On the 
other hand, General Gates was enabled to strengthen his army 
constantly by fresh reenforcements. It was also ascertained at 
this time, that General Lincoln, after his last expedition, had 
brought in thirteen hundred new men. The lack of forage was 
first felt in the English army and its general soon found him 
self obliged, on the 30th, to send out a foraging party of two 
hundred and fifty men with a six-pounder, under Major Yon 
Lucke. They foraged on the other side of the Hudson, behind 
the left wing, and were not troubled in the least by the enemy. 
On the same day, a courier, sent by Colonel St. Leger, ar 
rived from Ticonderoga. He had been obliged to make his 
way through the woods in order to elude the vigilance of the 
many war parties of the enemy. The colonel wrote that he 
would start on his march to the army in a few days ; that the 
Brunswick recruits had arrived at Ticonderoga ; and that 
Brigadier Powell was thinking of retaining them as a reenforce-ment of that garrison. His report in regard to the expedition 
of the enemy under General Lincoln, agreed perfectly with the 
story of Cornet Graef. The four companies, which had been 
captured, were the same who had defended the new road. 
Powell had learned the fact of their capture only two days 
afterwards, when Lincoln, with the cannon which he had cap- 



IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 159 

tured, fired upon the log house and displayed the daring- 
courage of inarching in front of forts Carillon and Independence 
and summoning the commanders to surrender. This demand 
being refused, he made four different assaults on as many 
different days ; but all proving abortive he marched off. On 
his retreat, he attempted to capture Diamond island in Lake 
George, but being bravely received by the commander, Captain 
Obry of the 47th, he was compelled to make a precipitate 
retreat having lost about sixty men in killed and wounded. 
Captain Obry pursued, and recaptured the ship and bateau. 

As we have before mentioned, Burgoyne sent patrols from 
the left wing to the rear of the Americans for the purpose of 
ascertaining their position. The Americans did the same thing. 
They sent patrols around the right wing of the English, and 
even had the audacity to come up close behind the head quarters 
in the centre. Ou the 1st of October, a few English soldiers, 
who were digging potatoes in a field five hundred paces in the 
rear of head quarters, were suddenly surprised by the enemy, 
who suddenly issued from the woods and carried off the men in 
the very faces of their comrades. For these sallies the Ameri 
cans also generally employed Indians who were called Stock- 
bridges. Many soldiers disappeared in this manner whenever 
they dared go beyond the line of guards to procure food or 
other necessaries from the inhabitants of the neighborhood. 
In order to guard against this, liiedesel issued the strictest 
orders to the Germans never to go beyond the line of outposts 
without special permission. Patrols of dragoons were also 
detached to ride over the roads in the rear of the army and 
arrest every man whom they should find. For the safety of the 
head quarters, moreover, some fortifications were thrown up 
and several of the outposts pushed farther into the woods. 

Nothing as yet being known. respecting the position of the

enemy, the occasion of the return of Cornet Graef into the 
American camp was made use of for this purpose. According 
to custom he was accompanied by an officer as far as the out 
posts of the enemy. Captain Gerlach was the one selected for 
this mission, and he did his best to find out something about 
the Americans. He arrived unmolested in front of their out 
posts, but gained nothing whatever, as a dense wood prevented 
him from seeing anything. He, therefore, returned without 
accomplishing his object, although he had been two thousand 
paces beyond the outposts of the English. The same day 
General Eiedesel went out on a reconnoitering expedition with 
the yagers. His intention was to explore the course of the 
ditch, and he did succeed in gaining the other side ; but the 
bank was so steep and covered with such dense thickets that 
nobody could get through, and he also was forced to return 
without having accomplished his purpose. 

Meanwhile Burgoyne still kept the men at work on the 
fortifications. On the morning of the 4th of October, the 47th 
was ordered to throw up a new line of embankments toward 
bridge No. 1. The pontoons were defended by the sailors who 
were daily drilled for the purpose. There were now only sufficient rations for sixteen days ; and foraging parties, necessarily 
composed of a large number of men, were sent out every day. At 
length General Burgoyne found himself obliged to cut down the 
daily rations from a pound and a half of bread, and the same 
quantity of meat, to a pound of bread and a pound of meat; 
and, as he had heard nothing either of How T e or Clinton, not 
withstanding the former s promise to send word in the course 
of eight days, he began to be seriously alarmed. In the eve 
ning of the 4th he had a conference with the generals, Phillips, 
Riedesel and Fraser, in respect to future operations. The 
subjects of consultation were the strength of the enemy, who 
outnumbered him four to one, his ignorance of their position, 
the lateness of the season, the scarcity of provisions, and the 
nonreception of intelligence froni General Clinton. Several 



IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 161 

plans were proposed by him by which he hoped to extricate 
himself from these difficulties. His idea was as follows : To 
surround the left flank of the enemy j and, after leaving eight 
hundred men for the defense of the ground between bridges 
Nos. 1 and 2, endeavor to get in its rear. This proposition 
caused considerable controversy ; for the question arose whether 
eight hundred men would be sufficient for the purpose assigned 
them. The safety of the whole army depended upon this ; for 
if this force should be beaten and the bridges in its rear 
taken, then the entire army would be completely cut off; and 
even if this detachment held its ground the position might still 
be lost since, as three or four days were necessary to get 
round through the woods and pathless thickets, the enemy 
would have abundance of time to mass his force on this spot, 
when he would, in all probability, capture the men and destroy 
the two bridges the only means of retreat. Such a hazardous undertaking must be thoroughly considered j and it was, 
therefore, agreed to inspect carefully on the next day the forti 
fications in that place, and the surrounding country. 

During the night of the 5th, the pickets were again attacked, 
and one-half of the troops of the left wing remained under 
arms. 

On the morning of the following day, the generals, in consequence of yesterday s consultation, rode to the designated spot. 
Here they found considerable fault, both in regard to the 
manner in which the fortifications had been located, and the 
place chosen for the artillery and supply trains. Three of the 
fortifications not only were built too large, but were not pro 
portionately adapted for defense, since, it being impossible for 
their guns to reach the valleys between the hills, the enemy 
could debouch from the woods on to the ground without being 
obliged to take the batteries on the heights. The. generals met 
again in the evening of the same day to continue their consulta 
tions. General Riedesel suggested that if it were impossible to 
get in the enemy s rear in one day, it would be more advisable 
21 



162 MAJOR GENERAL EIEDESEL 

to recross the Hudson, and again occupy their old position 
behind the Battenkill. Thus, not only would the communication with Lake George be regained, but the arrival of Clinton s 
army from the south could be safely awaited. The other 
generals were also in favor of this suggestion ; but Burgoyne, 
regarding a retrograde movement as disgraceful, at first would 
not hear to it. Subsequently, however, he said that on the 7th, 
he would undertake another great reconnoitering expedition 
against the enemy s left wing, to ascertain definitely his position, 
and whether it would be advisable to attack him. Should the 
latter be the case, he intended to advance on the enemy on the 
8th with his entire army ; but if he should not think an attack 
advisable, then he would, on the llth, march back to the Bat 
tenkill. 

On the Gth, a force of Americans, numbering five to six 
hundred men, again attacked the entire line of outposts, driving 
back those of them that were farthest advanced. At first only 
small detachments were sent to their support as their assailants 
soon retreated. The latter were pursued by a party of Indians 
and provincials up to the very pickets of the enemy, the first of 
which were driven in. The Indians advanced as for as a few 
sheds, which they fired. A little distance beyond these sheds 
was a house, in which, at this time, there happened to be a few 
American generals, who, hearing the approaching commotion, 
hastily mounted their horses and quickly galloped oif. A few 
of the Indians, who had approached nearest the house, sent a 
few bullets after them, one of which wounded one of the officers. 
The house was then set on fire. In this skirmish, several were 
wounded on both sides, and four prisoners were taken by the 
English. 

At ten o clock in the morning of the 7th, rations and liquor 
for four days having been previously issued to the army, General 
Burgoyne, with fifteen hundred men and eight cannon, started 
on his reconnoitering expedition, accompanied by Generals llied- 
esel, Phillips and Fraser. The troops, on this occasion, were 



AV 7770 AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 1(]3 

taken from till the regiments except the 47th. All the Indians 
(one hundred and eighty) and the corps of provincials crossed 
the right flank in a large circuit through the woods. The 
detachment itself, divided into three columns, advanced toward 
the right to within a quarter of an hour s march of the enemy s 
camp. The first picket, which was met near Waisser s house, 
was driven in, and the eminence, on which it had stood, occupied. 
The British were then placed in such a position, that the smallness 
of their number was concealed as much as possible. In this situation they remained for an hour and a half, during which interval 
the generals consulted together as to the manner in which the 
reconnoissance should be continued. Toward three in the after 
noon, the yagers discovered near a house, that lay a little way 
in advance and was separated from them by a ditch, a small body 
of the Americans. The latter, however, grew stronger and 
stronger ; and Burgoyne, supposing they meant to oppose his 
further advance, fired his two twelve-pounders at them several 
times, but without producing the least effect. On the contrary, 
they continued to increase in numbers. Finally, at four in the 
afternoon, they attacked his left wing with great spirit, soon 
forcing the English grenadiers, who were stationed in the woods 
at this point, to retreat. They next threw their entire force 
upon the centre, which was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel 
Specht, and consisted of three hundred men. But even then, 
Specht, who had already withstood the attack for a long time, 
would have maintained his ground, had not Lord Balcarras been 
called back through a misunderstanding. His flanks, however, 
were now exposed the enemy were on his sides and front 
and to avoid being cut off, he was obliged to retreat. This he 



1 The account of this portion of the action is much fuller and clearer in the Auxili 
aries / and, as each account is the complement of the other, and should be read 
together for a full understanding of the battle, the one in the Auxiliaries is here 
given : 

" At four o clock in the afternoon the Americans attacked the left wing, com 
posed of the grenadiers under command of Major Ackland, who were posted 
in the wood, with such resolution, that they were obliged to give ground. Lieu- 
accomplished in good order. The Americans now advanced with 
more vehemence and in greater numbers ; and the detachment 
was nearly surrounded when Burgoyne determined to retreat 
to the great redoubt on the right wing. Scarcely was this 
point reached, when the enemy attacked it with the same vigor 
they had hitherto shown, but without success. Another body 
at the same time attacked the embankments of Breymann s 



tenant Colonel Specht, who stood in the centre of the line with three hundred Ger 
mans, and whose left flank was exposed by the retreating of the grenadiers, ordered 
the two regiments of Rhetz and Hesse Hauau to form a curve ; and, supported by 
the artillery, he thus covered his flank which was in imminent danger. He maintained himself long and bravely in this precarious position, and would have stood 
his ground still longer, had he not been separated from the right wing, under Lord 
Balcarras, in consequence of the latter being unexpectedly commanded to take up 
another position with his light infantry. Thus Specht s right flank was as much 
exposed as his left. The brunt of the action now fell entirely on the Germans, who 
had to sustain alone the impetuous onset. The balls struck within their lines from 
three different sides. The three captains, Fredersdorf, Gleisenberg, Dahlstiena, 
and Ensign Geyling of Hesse Hanau fell dangerously wounded. The two cannons 
of Hesse Hanau were taken by the enemy. 

" Brigadier General Fraser, who, until then, had been stationed more to the right, 
with one-half of the English grenadiers, the light infantry and the 24th Regiment, 
perceived in what danger the centre was, and hurried on to its succor with the 24th 
Regiment. But scarcely had he appeared on the scene of action, when he was 
mortally wounded by a rifle ball. He sank down from his horse, and was borne 
away from the field. Thereupon Major Forster took the command of Eraser s 
troops, but as he was as yet separated from the centre, he, too, was charged in front 
and on his two flanks. He also was exposed to the most galling fire, till at last Bur 
goyne gave the order to retreat to the great redoubt." 

The grenadiers, under Ackland, were stationed a few yards to the left, and at the 
foot of an eminence now (1867) covered by an orchard, about two rods east of the 
road leading from Q.uaker springs to Stillwater, and twenty rods southeast of the 
house now (1867) occupied by Joseph Rogers. The Germans who were the centre 
under Specht, and the cannons of Hesse Hanau, were posted on top of this eminence 
where is now the orchard. Thus the grenadiers, under Ackland, were to the left 
of the Germans. It was here, therefore, on the top of the eminence, that the hottest 
part of the first of this battle was fought, and where Ackland was wounded. Fraser 
was shot midway between the orchard and Rogers s house. A bass-wood tree now 
marks the spot. This tree is a shoot out of the stump of the tree that stood at the 
time where Fraser fell. 

1 This redoubt was three rods south of the present barn yard of Mr. Ebenezer 
Leggett, whose house as mentioned in a preceding note stands on the old clearing of Freeman, the site of the first action of the 19th of September. Balls and 
skeletons are still picked up on this spot. I myself, this summer (1867) picked up 
four grape shot on the site of the redoubt.

division in front l and on the left flank. The grenadiers com 
posing this corps, fought bravely, but being only two hundred 
strong, and their commander the chivalric Breymann being 
shot dead, they were compelled to retreat. This latter misfor 
tune was owing to the fact that the Canadian companies, belonging to the reconnoitering expedition, were absent from their place, 
by the side of this corps, part of them being in the great redoubt, 
and the others not having returned to their position. Had they 
been in their places, it would have been impossible to surround 
the left flank of Breymann. Specht, coming up at this moment, 
endeavored to retake the entrenchments captured by the Ame 
ricans j but, night intervening, he not only failed to accomplish 
this, but in the general confusion, was taken prisoner along 
with a few other officers. As soon as it grew dark, the enemy 
desisted from their attack upon the fortifications and retreated. 
In this action, both General Arnold and General Fraser were 
severely wounded. There were also heavy losses upon both 
sides. The cannon, with the exception of two howitzers, fell 
into the hands of the Americans ; also the six-pounders which 
were in the entrenchments of Breymann. 

General Burgoyne, having now resolved to retreat to the 



1 The traces of Breymann s intrenchments are yet to be seen very plainly. They 
lie about twenty rods northwest of Mr. Leggett s house. The place is elevated 
considerably by nature, and is known among the farmers in the vicinity as Bur- 
goyne s hill. This, however, is a misnomer. Properly, it is Breymann s hill. It 
was at the northwest corner of this eminence that Arnold was wounded. 

It will be seen from this account of the action of October 7th which is made up 
entirely of Riedesel s own journal that the name " battle of Semis s heights " - 
which has hitherto obtained when designating the scene of action, is entirely errone 
ous, and calculated to seriously mislead. The first action, on the 19th of September, 
W as as is well known fought on Freeman s farm. But, with a few exceptions, 
it has always been supposed, even by the best informed writers on the subject, 
that the second battle of the 7th of October, was fought on, or at the base of Semis s 
heights. The original maps of this action, however, as well as Riedesel s journal 
show, that the action began on ground about two hundred rods southwest of the 
site of the first battle at Freeman s farm, and ended on the same ground on which 
the first action was fought. Thus Bemis s heights is fully one mile and a half south 
of the battle ground. In fact, all the interest that attaches to these heights is, that 
they were the head quarters of General Gates during, and a short time previous to 
the action.

Battenkill. had the tents taken down during the night as quietly 
as possible, the whole army meanwhile remaining under arms. 
On the following morning (the 8th) the army left its fortified 
camp before daybreak, and marched toward the ground between 
bridges Nos. 1 and 2, in order to cover the train and hospital. 
The pickets behind their respective brigades formed the rear 
guard until the approach of day when they rejoined their 
several regiments. Scarcely had the outposts left their stations 
when the Americans, occupying them, threatened to attack the 
army in its new position. The latter was, of course, obliged to 
remain until the departure of the teams, and especially the 
hospital, which, otherwise, would have been exposed to the 
enemy s fire. The whole of the day was occupied by these 
preparations for the march, all of which were accomplished 
under the fire of the Americans. The outposts were conse 
quently kept engaged with the enemy, and the cannons con 
tinually fired to prevent the latter s advance. 

To prevent the army being molested in the rear, Burgoyne, at 
twelve M., sent Lieutenant Colonel Southerland with the 9th 
and 47th, toward Swords s house ; the light troops, hitherto 
stationed there, preceding the main body to reconnoitre the 
roads. As soon as it had grown dark, the pontoons were 
quietly taken up j and at ten o clock, the advance guard, led 
by Riedesel, began its march. Its rendezvous was near Swords s 
house, whence it marched in the following order : The Indians 
and provincials, under Captains Fraser and McKay, the extreme 
van ; then came the Brunswickers and the light battalion , 
then the two English regiments under Lieutenant Colonel 
Southerland ; then the heavy artillery and all the teams of the 
army ; last of all General Burgoyne with the rest of the army 
in two columns. The Germans were consequently ahead, and 
Lord Balcarras, with the English regiments, in the rear. The 
bateaux, with the remaining stores, followed the main body on 
the right bank of the Hudson. As it was impossible, with the 
lack of transportation, to take along the hospital, numbering 



IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 1Q7 

over eight hundred sick and wounded, and it being equally 
difficult to defend so long a line of inarch, these unfortunates 
had to be left to the magnanimity of the enemy. Doctor Hess 
remained with them, and a letter of recommendation was given 
him to General Gates. 

During the time that the army was lying in the camp at 
Freeman s farm, Mrs. General liiedesel occupied a little house 
about an hour s march behind the army. She was accustomed 
to visit her husband every morning at the camp to inquire 
after his health. Sometimes he came over, accompanied by a 
few officers, and took dinner with her. As the season had 
become more inclement, a house twenty feet square, made of 
logs, filled in with clay, was built for Mrs. Riedesel. It was 
called the Block house, and was situated very near her 
husband s camp. 1 She was to have moved into it the very day 
that the army began the retreat. 

It was three o clock in the afternoon when General Fraser, 
mortally wounded, was brought up from the field on a clumsy 
litter into the house, where Mrs. Riedesel, in great anguish, 
awaited the termination of events. The pine table was quickly 
cleared off and carried out of the room, its place being supplied 
by a bed on which the wounded man was laid. Amazing 
change ! On the very spot where the unfortunate general was 
to have sat and partaken of the joyous meal, was now his death 



1 This block house was standing until within the last twenty years about halfway 
between Wilbur s basin and Bemis s heights. It was built after the regular model 
of a block house with the upper story projecting. Hence, the name given it at the 
time. Mr. Lossingin presenting a picture of it in his beautiful Book of the Hudson, 
states that Fraser was brought to this house, where he died. But this is mani 
festly incorrect, and for two reasons : 1st, Mrs. Riedesel says in so many 
words in her journal, that the retreat prevented her occupying this house ; and, 2d, 
she states that when the corpse was brought out, many of the cannon balls aimed 
at the funeral cortege flew not far from her, and that she u distinctly saw her hus 
band" assisting at the burial. It is also stated in the text a few pages on, that 
Mrs. Riedesel saw from her house the obsequies. But this new block house was 
not less than two miles from the place of burial, with dense woods between. The 
block house was also at this time in flames (vide her Journal, page 121), although 
the fire was afterwards extinguished.

bed. 1 Other wounded men and officers were shortly brought 
in and laid in the hall and other corners of the small house. 
Finally, in the evening, General Kiedesel, accompanied by his 
adjutants, called in for a little while to convince his wife that 
he was still safe. As this room was the only one which could 
be occupied by Mrs. Riedesel, her children were obliged to 
sleep in it. She, herself, spent the night with another lady 
Lady Harriet Ackland, whose husband had been severely 
wounded and captured this same day. 

The dying general was never unconscious. When General 
Riedesel came to him in the evening, he requested that he 
might be buried at four o clock the next afternoon in the 
embankment No. 1. This had always been with him a favorite 
spot, on account of the beauty of the view. With perfect 
resignation he awaited his end, which he felt confident was 
near at hand. His chief sources of grief were for his wife, and 
for General Burgoyne and his army. At eight o clock on the 
following morning he expired. After washing the corpse and 
wrapping it in a winding sheet, he was placed on the bed and 
covered up with a sheet. Madame Riedesel, with her children, 
came back into the room after this had been done, and remained 
with the body, as there was no other place for her to stay, 
Burgoyne had the deceased general interred, according to his 
last wish, in the spot selected, with all military honors.- Not 
withstanding, the engagement was again renewed on this day, 
Burgoyne and suit were present at the burial, and remained 



1 General Gates (showed himself on this occasion exceedingly noble and generous 
toward the captives. That he might share in some manner their feelings, he com 
manded his troops to wheel round the instant they laid down their arms. He, him 
self, drew down the curtains of his carriage in which he had driven to the ground, 
and in which he was then seated. 

" Before the soldiers parted with their muskets, they knocked off in their sup 
pressed rage the butt ends ; and the drummers stamped their drums to pieces, 
while tears trickled down the bronzed cheeks of the warriors." Brunswick 
Journal. 

The laying down of the arms took place at some distance from the American 
troops. According to one of the journals of one of the Brunswick officers, the 
muskets were not laid down but only piled together. This authority also states, 
that no American officer was present others, that only Adjutant General Wilkin 
son. After the surrender, the British marched back without escort to the place 
where stood the hospitals (the present site of Alonzo Welsh s barns in Schuyler- 
ville), where they bivouacked that, night. 

2 This estimate includes only the number contained in the immediate camp and 
lines of Gates as seen by the three officers in passing through them. The exact 
number of Gates s army not counting the troops on the other side of the Hud 
son was 22,350 men. This appears by the official list sent by Gates himself to 
Burgoyne. Counting those on the other or east side of the river, the American 
army must have been at least 25,000. 

3 This statement in regard to the elegance of the dinner is entirely different from 
the one given of the dinner in the Brunswick Journal. The latter says : 

" General Burgoyne did not lose for a moment his sound sleep and good appetite. 
When he met General Gates, shortly after the signing of the treaty, in the American 
camp, he not only manifested his usual remarkable serenity and politeness, but 
had attired himself in full court dress, as if going to assist in some gala occasion,

the highest of the American generals were invited. The 
Americans acted with a great deal of decorum. No sign of 
scorn or pleasure at the misfortune of their enemies was visible 
upon their countenances. On the contrary, they manifested, 
on this occasion, their sympathy in a very becoming manner. 

It was then that the English learned for the first time, the 
real condition of the enemy, which had hitherto been a secret 
to them. Certainly, a rare example in the history of war. The 
American army occupied the heights near the house of Bemis. 
This position was naturally a strong one, and had been still 
further strengthened by art. The right wing rested on the 
Hudson ; while the front was covered by a muddy ditch behind 



He wore costly regimentals bordered with gold, and a hat with streaming plumes. 
He had bestowed the greatest care on his whole toilet, so that he looked like a 
dandy rather than a warrior. The American general was dressed, on the contrary, 
merely in a plain blue overcoat which had upon it scarcely anything indicative of 
his rank. 

"Upon the two generals first catching a glimpse of each other, they stepped 
forward simultaneously and advanced toward one another until they were only a 
few steps apart, when they stopped.* The English general took off his richly 
decorated hat in an elegant manner, and making a very polite bow, said, General, 
the caprice of war has made me your prisoner. The American general, in reply, 
simply returned his greeting and said, You will always find me ready to testify 
that it was not brought about through any fault of your excellency. 1 Both generals 
were attended, on this occasion, by their staff officers. The American officers vied 
with their general in their civilities to the captured prisoners, and in efforts to 
make them forget their misfortunes. 

" They then dined in Gates s tent, on boards laid across barrels, which served 
for a table. The dinner was served up in four dishes, which consisted of only 
ordinary viands, the American being accustomed to plain and frugal meals. The 
drink, on this occasion consisted of cider and rum, mixed with water. Burgoyne 
appeared at this time in excellent humor. He talked a good deal, and said many 
things flattering to the Americans. He, also, proposed a toast to General Wash 
ington, an attention that Gates returned by drinking the health of the king of 
England. Burgoyne ate and drank all the time with the greatest appetite, so that 
the German officers present were more than astonished at his demeanor under 
such circumstances. The American army was kept under arms as long as the 
dinner lasted." Manuscript Brunswick Journal. 

[* The site of this formal meeting of the two generals, is generally believed to 
have been where an old elm stands, on the main street in the village of Schuyler- 
ville. This, however, is a mistake. It was a few rods south by east of the present 
Schuyler mansion. The Champlain canal now passes over the exact spot where 
the two generals stood.]

which were the lines, having also a strong abatis in their front 
The left wing rested upon a height on the top of which was 
the so called school house. This also was covered by an abatis 
extending to the bottom of the hill. The heights were as steep 
in the rear, as in the front of the lines ; and upon these heights 
stood the army behind still other fortifications. 

This same day, the troops marched to the ground, where, on 
the 8th, the army had left its position, the same spot, in 
fact, where their pontoons had been thrown across the river. 
The following day they encamped at this spot, the generals 
going on as far as Stillwater, six miles beyond. On the next 
day (the 18th) the other troops under the protection of a bri 
gade, commanded by the American general, Glover, also arrived 
there. They were to have continued their march across the 
Hudson the same day, but there being a scarcity of rafts, only 
the English were sent across. The latter accordingly bivouacked 
on the other side, the Germans remaining on this. General 
Riedesel continued his march twenty-five miles further to 
Albany in the company of General Glover. Here he met 
Generals Burgoyne and Phillips. An adjutant of the former, 
Lieutenant Willford, had been sent in advance to Albany, in 
order to ask General Gates whether a few of the German officers could not be exchanged according to the treaty, and return 
to Canada. The American general answered that he could not 
exchange any more until he had received the necessary orders 
regarding it from General Washington, since it had only been 
a matter of courtesy on his part toward General Burgoyne and 
his army, that he had permitted three English officers to leave 
the army. This, however, did not include the German officers 
as he had already stated. 

General Burgoyne, thereupon, at the solicitation of Riedesel, 
who considered the German troops slighted on this occasion, 
again appealed to General Gates. General Riedesel justly 
perceived in this negligence toward the German officers a par 
tiality. 



]92 MAJOR GENERAL RIEDESEL 

On the journey to Albany, they passed by Half Moon on 
the Mohawk. This post was manned by nearly 4,000 men, 
under the direction of Gates, for the purpose of covering his 
rear, and also for the sake of having a position to fall back upon 
in case of a retreat. It was well selected and fortified. 

Generals Burgoyne and Riedesel took up their abode at 
Albany, in General Schuyler s house, the same general whose 
house and mills at Saratoga had been destroyed by the former. 
Burgoyne, embarrassed by the friendly manner in which he was 
received, expressed his regret to the American general in regard 
to this circumstance, and endeavored to excuse himself. Where 
upon, Schuyler smilingly answered that it did not much matter, 
for in war, it could not be otherwise ; an answer which, cer 
tainly, betrayed a noble trait of character. 

General Schuyler was a descendant of a Holland family. 
He was married to a rich American lady, and was in prosperous 
and happy circumstances. After the surrender of Ticonderoga 
he rallied the fragments of St. Clair s brigade, and with these 
and a few militia men, whom he had also gathered, went to Half 
Moon. Out of this grew the army, which was afterward under 
the command of Gates, Schuyler having, in the meantime, 
resigned. 

The inhabitants of Albany a city, at that time, containing 
eight hundred houses were rich, and mostly loyal to the 
cause of the king ; and it was for this reason that a strong 
garrison of American troops were stationed here, and a fort 
erected. 

On the 20th, the two nationalities of the royal army sepa 
rated; the English regiments going to the left, across the 
Green mountains toward Stockbridge, and the German troops 
across the green woods. The latter crossed the Hudson this 
day, and marched, under the escort of a militia regiment, com 
manded by Colonel Hied, to Schaticoke. At Albany, they 
learned that General Clinton had actually taken a^Esopus a few 
days since and burned it, but, hearing of the fate of the army 



AV 77/7? AMER1 CAN REVOLUTION. 193 

of Canada, had not dared to go further. On the same day (the 
20th). the Germans encamped near New City. 

On the 21st, Burgoyne dispatched his adjutant, Lord Peter- 
sen, Captain Gray and Captain Valency to New York. To the 
former, he entrusted his dispatches to the secretary of war in 
London, in which he announced these sad events. 

The contents of this document are familiar. We cannot, 
however, omit to quote it for the reason that General Riedesel 
has made notes to his translation, which are of great interest so 
far as they contradict several points in Burgoyne s dispatch, 
and place them in another light. It reads as follows : 

" My Lord : There was no possibility, since the 9th of September, when I sent my last report, to send letters to your 
excellency. I have now, my lord, to announce to you the 
events which have taken place in the army under my command 
since my last report; a series of hard work, bloody engagements and unceasing troubles. 

" My only tope, after the savages had entirely deserted me, 
consisted in a final cooperation with the other army. The 
regular troops having melted down by many engagements to 
3,500 men, of whom scarcely 2,000 were English, with short 
rations for only three days, and surrounded by over sixteen 
thousand enemies, without a possibility of retreat. I was 
forced to call a council of war. by whose unanimous voice I 
entered into negotiations with General Gates. The inclosed 
documents will show what an unexpected answer I received 
from the American general ; and the noble resolution of the 
council of war, upon its reception, will certainly evoke the 
esteem of my lord toward that council. 

" Before entering upon the details of these events, I consider 
it my duty to remark that I took the responsibility upon myself 
alone, of endeavoring to cross the Hudson and force a passage 
to Albany. I did not consider myself justified at that time in 
calling a council of war, because express orders and the season 
forbade such a course. 

25 
" After collecting provisions for thirty days, besides other 
necessaries for the expedition, and after building bridges and 
getting together the requisite number of bateaux. I crossed the 
Hudson on the 13th and 14th of September, and encamped the 
army on the heights and plains of Saratoga. The enemy was at 
this time near Stillwater. 

" On the 15th, the army advanced to a good position at a place 
called Dovogat. 

" On the 16th, several of the bridges had to be rebuilt and 
repaired. This was accordingly done by a party under a strong 
guard. At the same time a reconnoitering expedition was 
undertaken. 

" On the 17th, the army advanced further to a point three or 
four miles distant from the enemy, building bridges on its march. 

" On the 18th, the enemy was seen in considerable force, 
having come out with the intention of preventing us from 
building bridges, and perhaps of giving battle. As they could 
use on us no artillery, the bridge was finished under a scattering 
fire, which, however, was attended with inconsiderable loss. 

" On the 19th, the passage across the ravine and the roads 
having been sufficiently reconnoitered, the army advanced in 
the following order : Brigadier General Eraser, supported by 
the corps of Breymann, the better to cross the ravine and not 
lose the advantage of the heights, took a circuitous route to the 
right, and afterward covered the march of the army in that 
direction. This corps, accordingly, marched in three columns, 
having the provincials, Canadians and savages on their front 
and flanks. The English regiments of infantry, led by myself, 
crossed the ravine in a direct southerly line ; and, after reaching 
the height, formed in order of battle, in order to give Eraser s 
corps time to make the longer route, and also to equalize the 
left wing, which, under Generals Phillips and Riedesel, with 
the artillery and baggage, had taken the valley road in two 
columns. Several bridges had to be repaired on their way. 
Meanwhile, the 47th Regiment covered the bateaux. 



AV THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. \ &lt;J5 

" After the signal guns had been discharged at two o clock, 
as had been agreed upon for the purpose of notifying the other 
column when one was ready, the march was continued. Soon 
after, a few patrols of the enemy fired upon the advance of the 
English regiments, but without effect. After an hour s march, 
however, the English regiments, forming the advance guard, 
were attacked and forced to retreat. They soon rallied, how 
ever, and were properly supported. 

" As soon as the English columns came out of the woods, they 
dislodged the enemy by a few cannon shots from the houses, from 
the windows of which he had fired upon the pickets and Briga 
dier Fraser, with the greatest precision, occupied an advantageous 
height to the right of the English line. 

" At the same time, the enemy, who, from the nature of the 
ground, were well acquainted with our march, came out of his 
entrenchments intending to turn our right wing; but, being foiled 
by Fraser, he made a counter march, and with his entire force, 
attacked the English left wing. This movement the enemy could 
the easier carry out without our knowledge, as the country was 
entirely strange to us. 

" Toward three o clock, the three English regiments were seve 
rally attacked. This charge lasted until dark and the enemy 
being constantly reenforced by fresh troops, the 20th, 21st and 
62d English regiments were forced to remain under fire without 
intermission for four hours. The 9th Regiment was kept as a 
reserve. The English grenadiers, the 24th Regiment and the 
light infantry, were also under fire a considerable length of 
time. All these corps fought with their usual bravery. 

" The Brunswick yagers and the corps of Breyniann were also 
of great use ] but it was found necessary for them to occupy 
the heights just left by Fraser. Thus, they were used only 
singly and occasionally. 

" Major General Phillips, upon first hearing the firing, made 
his way through dense woods, taking with him Major Williams. 
I owe him many thanks for his counsels and his timely and per-tinent assistance, especially in renewing the attack in a very 
critical moment, and in the way in which, unmindful of his 
own safety, he led the 20th Regiment. 

" General Riedesel worked hard in bringing up a part of the 
left wing, and arrived just in time to attack the enemy with 
determination and bravery, at the moment that the left wing 
was sorely pressed by the enemy. The latter retreated in all 
directions, leaving us the battle field with five hundred dead, 
and three times that number wounded on his side. Owing to 
the darkness, we took but few prisoners. 

" The conduct of officers and privates has been excellent 
throughout. Brigadier General Eraser took his position with 
much judgment. General Hamilton was engaged constantly, and 
acquitted himself with much honor. The artillery distinguished 
itself; and the brigade artillery, under Captain Jones who was 
shot dead, did extremely well. 

" The army laid on their arms during the night and the following day, and subsequently took up an entrenched position within 
cannon shot of the enemy. The right wing was covered by a 
strong redoubt j and the left wing marched on to the plain to 
cover the stream which runs through it. Here also was our 
hospital, the 47th Regiment, the regiment Hesse Hanau and a 
corps of provincials encamped for greater safety on the plains. 

"We found that the victory of the 19th had brought us no 
other advantage than honor ; for the enemy, using all energy in 
fortifying his left and right wings, had rendered the latter already 
impregnable. 

" On our side, also, it was necessary to throw up redoubts both 
on the heights and on the plain, where were our hospitals and 
depots. Their latter defenses were needed not only to secure the 
hospital against attack, but to make sure of a defensive position 
in case our army should make a move against the enemy s flank. 

" On the 21st, a messenger arrived with a letter in cipher 
from General Clinton, wherein he notified me that he intended 
to attack Fort Montgomery in ten days. The letter was dated 



AV THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 19J 

the 10th of September. This is the only letter that I have 
received of the many which, perhaps, may have been sent by 
Sir William Howe and General Clinton. The messenger was 
sent back the same night to inform General Clinton of the 
critical position in which I was, and of the necessity of a diversion on his part in order to force General Gates to detach some 
troops from his army. The letter also stated that I was deter 
mined, if possible, to wait till the 12th of October for happy 
events. 

" On the two following days, two disguised officers were sent 
by different roads with the verbal message that I still continued 
to fortify my camp, and keep watch of the enemy who were 
daily increasing in strength. On the 3d October, I found it 
necessary to cut dowu the rations of the soldiers in order to 
make our provisions last longer. This was accepted by the 
army without the least murmuring. 

" The difficulties connected with a retreat into Canada was 
easily to be seen ; and even if it had been possible, I did not 
wish to place General Gates in a position to operate against 
Sir William Howe. These circumstances caused me to retain 
this position against all risks as long as possible. I reasoned 
with myself thus. The expedition, which I command, is, ac 
cording to the judgment of everybody an hazardous one. 
Circumstances may take place, which will enable General Gates 
to form a junction with General Washington, the consequence 
of which may make the whole war a failure on our part. The 
unsuccessful union with General Clinton and the impossibility 
of a retreat into Canada is only an accidental misfortune. 

"I remained in this position up to the 7th of October. I 
received no intelligence in regard to the expected junction, and 
the term of my stay in that place would expire in five days. It 
was considered advisable to make a movement against the left 
wing of the enemy for the purpose of ascertaining whether or 
no it was possible to find a road by which this junction could 
be effected, or the enemy dislodged on his left wing. 



198 MAJOR GENERAL R1EDESEL 

" A detachment of 1,500 men with two twelve-pounders, six 
six-pounders and two howitzers, under my command, was ordered 
to march. I was accompanied by Generals Phillips, Kiedesel 
and Brigadier General Fraser. The command of the right wing 
in camp was given to Brigadier General Hamilton ; the left to 
Brigadier General Specht ; and the centre to Brigadier Gall. 
The forces of the enemy, including their camp opposite to ours, 
amounted to double our number. Thus the strength of the 
detached command could not be made stronger than the above 
given number. I formed the marching corps when within 
three-quarters of a mile of the enemy s left wing. Captain 
Fraser s corps, with the savages, Canadians and provincials, 
had orders to march through the woods toward the left wing of 
the enemy, that by this movement they might keep the enemy 
in check. 

" We were prevented from advancing any further by an at 
tack of the enemy on our left wing, where the English grenadiers stood to cover our left flank. Major Ackland of the 
grenadiers withstood the attack firmly ; but it was impossible 
for him to prevent the enemy extending his attack to the 
Germans who were stationed close to the grenadiers. Want of 
troops made it impossible to form a second line to support the 
attack on the left wing. Hitherto our right wing had not been 
attacked; but we soon found that the enemy, with a strong 
column, was marching around our right wing in order to turn 
it and cut off our retreat. The light infantry and the 24th 
Regiment were, therefore, ordered to form a second line, and 
cover the retreat to our camp. 

" While this movement was in progress, the enemy, who had 
been reenforced, made a second attack upon our left wing, which, 
by a superiority of numbers, was forced to retreat. Whereupon, 
the light infantry and the 24th Regiment were obliged to move 
quickly forward to cover that portion of the troops which, other 
wise, would have been cut off. It was here, that Brigadier Fraser 
was mortally wounded. 



IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. ]()9 

" The danger, wliicli now threatened our whole camp, was of 
such a nature, that I sent orders to Generals Phillips and Ried- 
esel to cover the retreat. This order was executed with the 
greatest precision. The cannon, under the command of Major 
Williams, had to be left behind, all the horses and most of the 
artillerymen being either dead or wounded. 

" Scarcely had the troops reached their camp, when it was 
stormed by the enemy. The latter advanced, under the fire of 
musketry, grape and canister, against our lines, but they being 
defended with much valor by my Lord Balcarras commanding 
the light infantry and a part of a detachment of this expedi 
tion, the enemy, led by General Arnold, was repulsed and their 
leader himself wounded. Unfortunately, the enemy captured 
the entrenchments of the German reserve under Lieutenant 
Colonel Breyinann, who was shot dead. In spite of my order 
to retake these redoubts, it was in no wise executed. By this 
misfortune, a road was left open for the enemy to fall upon our 
right flank and rear. Night coming on ended this affair. 

" In this sad plight, the army was ordered, during the night, 
to leave its present position, and occupy the heights around our 
hospital, a movement which compelled the enemy to take up an 
entirely new position. This movement, with all the teams and 
artillery, was carried out without any loss; and, on the 8th, we 
offered battle to the enemy in our new position. Perceiving, 
however, that they intended to turn our right flank, and as 
nothing but a retreat to Saratoga could hinder this movement, 
the army started at nine o clock in the evening. General llied- 
esel led the advance, and General Phillips the rear guard. 

" This retreat, with the artillery and baggage, was accom 
plished under a fire of musketry from the enemy, without, 
however, the slightest loss. But we experienced the greatest 
difficulty in transporting the bateaux. A severe rain storm 
prevented the army from reaching Saratoga on this night; 
neither could the artillery and baggage cross the Fishkill the 
following day. 
" When we came near Saratoga, a corps of the enemy, consisting of five or six hundred men, was noticed upon the heights 
in the vicinity of the barracks ; but they at once retreated across 
the Hudson and formed a junction with a detachment of another 
corps on the opposite side of the river. 

" On the 10th, it was considered advisable to send working 
men, under a strong escort, in advance to repair the bridges 
and roads leading to Fort Edward. The corps of Captain 
Fraser and McKay, and the 47th Regiment were dispatched for 
this purpose. But the enemy s army advancing and occupying 
the heights on the other side of the Fishkill with the object of 
crossing the river and making an attack, this detachment was 
ordered back. The provincials were left behind at the first 
bridge, which needed repairs, but being attacked, they ran 
away, and thus the working party could not complete the 
bridge. During this retreat, several bateaux were captured by 
the enemy, and a number of the men who guarded them killed 
or wounded. 

" On the llth, the attack on the bateaux was renewed. 
Several of them were taken and retaken but the proximity of 
the enemy made it impossible for us to defend them any longer, 
and it was therefore ordered that the provisions should be 
brought on land, a command, which, under the musketry fire 
of the enemy, was executed only with the greatest difficulty. 

" The possibility of a further retreat was now discussed by a 
council of war consisting of the generals. The minutes of this 
council are herewith inclosed. 

" It was thought that the only chance of a retreat was in this 
plan, viz : That the soldiers should carry their rations that 
the artillery and baggage should be left behind ; and that the 
passage of the river should be effected above Fort Edward. 

" Before, however, such a movement could be carried out. 
some patrols, who had been sent out, returned and announced 
that the enemy was strongly fortified upon the heights of Fort 
Edward, and that he was also encamped in considerable force 



IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 201 

between Fort Edward and Lake George. 1 The opposite bank 
was likewise occupied by detachments of the enemy ; while on 
this side of the river, their army was so near us, that it was im 
possible for our troops to march a mile without being detected. 

k Meanwhile, the army of the enemy daily grew stronger by 
new arrivals of militia and volunteers, until it was estimated 
altogether at 16,000 men. His position was formed in the 
shape of a crescent, and was surrounded on all sides by such 
natural strong holds, that it could not be attacked with any 
possibility of success. In this situation our army took up the 
best position which it could find; and entrenched itself in the 
hope of succor ; or, failing in this, in the next best hope of 
being attacked by the enemy. During the whole of this time 
the army rested on its arms, being Cannonaded from all sides. 
Yes, the enemy s rifles reached even the line itself; happily, 
however, without great effect. 

"Accurate measurements of the provisions still on hand were 
made ; and after the condition of the army had been written 
down, a council of war was called, in which were included the 
battalion and corps commanders. The inclosed document con 
tains the result of this council, a result which was inevitable 
in our situation and ought to be considered honorable. After 
the convention with General Gates had been concluded, the 
latter showed me his army, and I had the consolation to have 
as many witnesses, as my army numbered men, to the fact that 
its numbers were even greater than I have just now reported. 2 

" I take the liberty of referring you for further particulars 
to the verbal report of my adjutant, my Lord Peterson, 3 and 
avail myself of this occasion to recommend him to the favorable 
consideration of his majesty. This noble man, with his great 
talents, is capable of rendering great services to his country. 
His conduct, during the last campaign, was such as to earn for

26 
him the applause of everybody ; and I am convinced that his 
merits are sufficient to procure for him the same advantage and 
honor which officers usually receive who announce auspicious 
tidings. 

" I also append a statement of the dead and wounded, which, 
however, I cannot claim as perfectly accurate, since the sepa 
ration of the troops has made it entirely impossible to give it 
correctly. The English officers have spilled their blood in 
profusion and with honor ; and all who have fallen are worthy 
men, among whom the patriotic character of Major General 
Fraser will long be cherished by this army. Nor are those of 
the army who are still alive to be less honored. 

" The life of a general is more exposed by reason of the kind 
of warfare carried on here, than elsewhere. Notwithstanding 
which, I have had the good fortune to remain alive. Whether 
I shall consider the salvation of my life as a fortune or a mis 
fortune, depends on the decision of his majesty, in regard to 
my conduct, and upon the judgment of those who understand 
the military profession ; also upon that of the impartial and 
respectable portion of my countrymen. 

" I am, etc., 

" BURGOYNE." 

" P. S. The inclosed is an accurate copy of that which I 
have sent by my Lord Petersen. Captain Gray, the bearer of 
this, is an officer of great merit, and is especially worthy of 
recommendation, since he has served with great diligence and 
integrity in this laborious campaign in spite of a wound which 
he received at Hubert town, and which is not yet entirely 
cured/ 1 



1 This was a copy sent to Lord St. Germain. Captain Gray was dispatched with 
it, in case Lord Petersen should meet with any misfortune in carrying the other 
dispatches. Note to original. 



L\ THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 203 

" NOTES OF GENERAL HIEDESEL TO THIS DOCUMENT. 

" First. The expression in General Burgoyne s dispatch, of 
which scarcely 2,000 were Englishmen is painful. As if 1,500 
Germans made the army less respectable than it would have 
been if it had consisted of Englishmen only. The successful 
aid which the German troops rendered the English at Hubert 
town, and again on the 19th of September, should rather 
augment the attachment and love between the two nations ; 
and the English in this army owe it to their German comrades 
in arms, to hold them in high esteem, especially after Brigadier 
Fraser expressed his heartfelt thanks to them upon the termi 
nation of the action at Hubert town, and after the public decla 
ration of Brigadier Hamilton, that the German troops had 
saved him. Indeed, the praises of General Burgoyne, in the 
order which he issued, ought to kill the poison in this ex 
pression. 

" Secondly. When the attack on the column of General 
Burgoyne had commenced, and when General Phillips came 
from the left wing, no one knew where General Fraser was. 
This makes a slight difference as regards the praise which is 
given to the latter, that, he had taken his position to the right 
of the English regiments wifh precision/ 

" It is to be presumed that the enemy knew nothing of General Fraser, and that it was never the intention of the enemy to 
attack this corps, but rather to turn the left wing of Burgoyne. 
If, therefore, the reported vigorous attack of the English grenadiers and the 24th Regiment had been more vigorous, and had 
taken place at the right time, the 20th, 21st and 62d Regiments, 
under the brave Brigadier General Hamilton, would not have 
been forced to withstand a severe tire lasting four hours/ 
which ruined them, but did not make them retreat. 

" Thirdly. It is not to be denied that the presence of General 
Phillips did much to withstand the attack ; nor, further, is it to 
be gainsaid that his counsel was of much use. Nor, again, is 
it to be denied that Major Williams s conduct was praiseworthy. 
Still, it is difficult to say whether it was advisable for the latter 
to leave his post, where his presence would have been of great 
service in case of an attack from the enemy. But as regards 
the four cannon which Major Williams is said to have brought 
with him, let me say that this must be a mistake, for these four 
cannon were still found at nine o clock in the evening on the 
road. Perhaps the two six-pounders were meant that Captain 
Beusch brought up, and with which he renewed the cannonading 
that had almost ceased, in consequence of most of the English 
artillerymen being either dead or wounded. 

" Fourthly. General Iliedesel, who could have arrived an hour 
sooner had he received the long wished for order, brought up a 
part of the left wing just at the critical moment, when the enemy 
having made an attack on the left wing of Brigadier General 
Hamilton, the latter was withstanding it with great courage, 
but in momentary expectation of being driven back. 

" The advantage gained by falling on the right flank of the 
enemy, and his astonishment at being attacked by fresh troops, 
who, with closed ranks, delivered a regular fire, caused their 
right wing to retreat ; and a fresh attack by Hamilton at the 
same time, gave us l Complete victory, which could have been 
attended with the capture of many prisoners, had not night 
come on. 

" Fifthly. The attempt to keep Gates occupied up to the 12th, 
in order to prevent his making another move, together with the 
desire to learn more of the condition of the enemy, induced 
General Burgoyne to undertake heavy reconnoitering expeditions in spite of representations to him of the critical position 
in which both he and the army were placed. The constant 
presence of detachments of the enemy in our rear, the successful 
expedition whereby the bridge at Saratoga was burned, and the 
corps which was seen on the other side of the river near the 
Battenkill, were plain indications of the intention of the enemy 
to surround us and cut off our retreat to the Battenkill and 




AV 77/7? AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 205 

Fort Edward. Notwithstanding, however, all these critical 
events, Burgoyne, by false or pleasant news, was prevented 
from retreating to the Battenkill at the only time in which it 
was possible to do so. This, it was his duty to have done under 
those circumstances, especially as the season was far advanced, 
and the distance to New York was so great, that a junction with 
an army coining from the city was more chimerical than pro 
bable J 

"Incited by zeal, General Burgoyne refused to retreat; and 
the reconnoissance (not the foraging expedition which had taken 
place the day previous) was carried out on the 7th of October. 
General Burgoyne formed a detachment, three-quarters of a 
mile from the enemy s left wing, in a miserable position. Not 
withstanding we were close to the enemy, we could see nothing 
of his position j nor could Captain Fraser, who had approached 
the enemy still closer by a circuitous route through the woods, 
discover anything of him either. It was, therefore, resolved to 
await the enemy in this position. Meanwhile, General Fraser, 
finding two houses filled with forage, seized this opportunity to 
send to the camp after a corps of properly accoutred men to 
capture it. &lt; 

" The enemy was seen in small bodies while we were waiting 
for the approach of evening. We were amusing ourselves by 
firing at him with artillery, when suddenly we heard the fire of 
musketry on our left wing where Major Ackland was posted 
with all the English grenadiers. Shortly after this, we saw the 
grenadiers coming back in confusion, very likely discouraged 
by the loss of their brave commander, Major Ackland, who had 
been wounded and captured. By this retreat, the left wing of 
the German command, led by Lieutenant Colonel Specht, was 
exposed ; but detachments from the light infantry regiments of 



1 The reader will bear in mind that these opinions of Riedesel are not given after 
the event when it is so easy to say what might have been. Precisely these views, it 
will be remembered, he had urged upon Burgoyne before the self-confidence of the 
latter had made their adoption too late. 



206 MAJOR GENERAL KIEDESEL 

Hanau and Rhetz were at once sent forward, and by the assistance of the brave Major Wolham and the English artillery, the 
position was maintained. Captains Fredersdorf, Gleisenberg, 
Dahlstern and Gailitz of Hanau, were severely wounded on 
this occasion, and the Hanau artillery was lost by the retreat 
of the English grenadiers. The brave Major Forster, with two 
hundred and sixty English grenadiers, withstood an equally 
severe fire on the right wing. 

" In this critical situation of affairs, Brigadier General Fraser 
received orders to succor the centre. He arrived with the 24th 
Regiment, and was mortally wounded. My Lord Balcarras was 
sent to another position whereby our right wing was exposed in 
the same manner that the left had been during the whole time. 
Notwithstanding all these untoward circumstances, however, 
Major Forster and Lieutenant Colonel Specht kept their posts 
until Burgoyne sent orders for a retreat, which, in spite of 
being hard pressed by the enemy, they executed in good order. 
The cannon had to be left behind, as the horses had been shot, 
and most of the men either killed or wounded. Major Williams 
was captured. According to the order of Burgoyne, we were 
obliged to retreat in 4he direction of the great redoubt on the 
right wing of Eraser s camp. But scarcely had the troops 
reached this redoubt, when it was attacked by the enemy with 
great vigor and stormed. On our side, also, it was defended 
with great valor. 

" Every one knows that after the affair at Bennington, Brey- 
mann s corps, on the 19th of September numbered scarcely five 
hundred men. Of this number he was obliged to give up three 
hundred men to the detachment which was sent out on a recon- 
noitering expedition. Thus barely two hundred men remained 
with him. With this small band he defended his line for a 
long while, and Lieutenant Cleve reported very favorably con 
cerning this post, before General Riedesel had been sent from 
this position to the left wing. 

" It must be noticed here, that the left wing of Breymann s 



IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 207 

entrenchment was covered by two houses occupied by Canadians. These Canadians were ordered to join the reconnoi- 
teriug detachment; thus the houses were empty and without 
defense, a fact of which Lieutenant Colonel Breyuiann knew 
nothing. 

" Profiting by this, the enemy marched through this opening, 
and attacked the left wing of Breymann on the left flank and 
rear. Lieutenant Colonel Breymann was shot dead ; and a 
handful of men was driven back with the loss of its artillery, 
camp and baggage. This news reached the general during the 
absence of Kiedesel. Lieutenant Colonel Specht, urged on by 
harsh and cutting words, resolved, in order to save the honor 
of the Germans, to retake the entrenchment, but his detachment 
being indiscriminately mixed up with the English in the great 
redoubt, and night preventing him from collecting them together, 
he rallied four officers and about fifty men with whom, sorely 
chafed and offended, he started, half in despair, to attack the 
enemy. Unacquainted with the road, and in the darkness of the 
night, he met a man in the woods who pretended to belong to 
the company of McKay, and who promised to lead him to Brey- 
niann s corps. But this man, instead of keeping his promise, 
delivered him as a traitor into the hands of the enemy, by 
whom he and the four .officers were captured. The men, how 
ever, discovering the treachery of their guide in time, made 
their escape. 

" This is the answer to the severe expression of General Bur- 
goyne : Unfortunately the entrenchment of the reserve, under 
Lieutenant Colonel Breymann, was taken after the latter was 
shot. Orders were given that it should Ije retaken, but they were 
never executed. 

" Sixthly. During the retreat on the evening of the 8th, 
General Riedesel commanded the advanced guard consisting of 
the 47th and 62d Regiments of light infantry of the Brunswick 
grenadiers and the corps of Captain Fraser. The advanced 
guard arrived at Dovogat at three o clock on the morning of the 
9th. Here Riedesel learned that the enemy were entrenched on 
the heights of Saratoga at a short distance from the barracks. 
He thereupon ordered the column to halt, sent Captain Fraser 
in advance to reconnoitre, and reported to General Burgoyne, 
who had arrived before daybreak, that the enemy were on the 
other side of the Hudson. But, to the astonishment of every 
one, we remained the whole day at Dovogat near the Battenkill. 
At this time the enemy near the Batteukill, according to all 
reports, were not strong enough to have prevented our crossing 
the river ; but even if we had not been able to get across, we 
might have continued our inarch on this side, crossed the ferry 
near Fort Edward, and occupied the favorable heights at that 
place. Thus, in one way or the other, the army could have 
been saved, although the baggage might have been lost. 

" The army, however, passed the night at Fishkill, the enemy 
holding the whole of the opposite bank. General Burgoyne 
very prudently dispatched the 47th and 62d Regiments, under 
Lieutenant Colonel Southerland toward Fort Edward, Captain 
Twiss at the same time being ordered to repair the bridges. 
According to the report of Lieutenant Colonel Southerland, it 
is evident that had the army continued marching, it could have 
reached the heights of Fort Edward before the enemy ; and in 
case of this being impossible, we could have crossed the river 
higher up, and thus have reached the heights of Fort George 
without material loss. Nobody knows why the retreat was not 
continued. Lieutenant Colonel Southerland was ordered back 
again to the army. The sad situation in which the army was 
near Saratoga, after all the chances for a retreat had been 
neglected, is familiar to every one. 

" General Riedesel, as late as the 12th, proposed a retreat, 
and this proposition was approved ; but it was discovered that 
the distribution of rations had been forgotten. The distribution was thereupon ordered at once j and it was resolved that 
the retreat should be commenced immediately, if this distribution be accomplished by ten o clock. But when everything was 



IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 209 

ready for the march, the retreat was postponed until the following day when it was impossible to carry it out. l 

" These are the remarks which G-eneral lliedesel found 
necessary to make in regard to the letter of General Burgoyne 
to Lord Germain, and in regard, also, to the minutes of the 
council, upon communicating them to his excellency, the duke, 
and his own countrymen. 

" It seems that General Burgoyne has been kind enough to 
save the honor of General Riedesel, yea, even to speak with 
distinction and praise in regard to his conduct. Yet it is pain 
ful to the latter to know that he has not spoken of the troops 
with the same distinction, especially in regard to the affair of 
the 7th of October, and this, too, notwithstanding General 
Riedesel declared that he could have done nothing praiseworthy 
without the good will and the active cooperation of the troops 
which he commanded. 

" For this reason General Riedesel had rather be deprived of 
all praise than see his troops robbed of the same glory in a 
public and unjust manner. 

" For this reason, and with this intention, he desires to publish his ideas and relate circumstances truthfully for the honor 
of his nation. 

" RIEDESEL, Major General. 

" Cambridge, May 8th, 1778." 

In order to secure himself against all reproach, General 
Riedesel compiled a memorandum containing the course of 
events from the beginning of the campaign of 1777, up to the 
unfortunate affair near Saratoga, which was signed by all the 
German commanders. We find an extract from this memo 
randa in Madame Riedesel s book, and also in a patriotic 
journal, entitled The Brunswick Magazine, No. XI. One 



1 Riedesel, it will be remembered, himself saw to the distribution of the rations, 
which was all accomplished by ten o clock, the time specified. 

27 
reads like the other; but both are, as the postscript says, only 
extracts. Although the correspondent of that magazine states, 
that he had taken it from the original papers of the Brunswick 
general, the original in Riedesel s own handwriting is among 
his papers which are no longer in Brunswick. As this memo 
randum contains, in general, nothing that has not been already 
mentioned, we will not copy it here. It is signed by Brigadier 
Generals Yon Specht and Gall, 1 Lieutenant Colonel Leuz, 
Major Von Mengen, Von Ehrenkrook and Lucke, also by 
Captains Lohreisen and Schottelius. 

From the foregoing, we see lliedesel s opinion concerning 
many things undertaken by Burgoyne. We find in it, however, 
none of that indignation which would certainly have been excusable, under the circumstances, considering the conduct of the 
general toward the German troops, and the misfortune which he 
brought upon them by his thoughtless conduct. But KiedeseFs 
character was too noble, and he had too much tact to give vent to 
passionate expressions. It is the language of a man who is tran 
quil, and knows how to govern himself, and who is also conscious 
of his own rectitude. No allusion is made by him to the failing 
which caused General Burgoyne to commit many a rash act. 

The feeling wife, however, looks at these misfortunes in a 
different light. Her husband, her children, her friends, the 
brave soldiers and herself suffered too much from the conduct 
of the commanding general to permit of her silence. She was 
a witness of scenes at which her sense of right, duty and mo 
rality revolted. She therefore speaks of the conduct of the 
British general with not so much consideration as her husband. 
Accordingly, in her interesting book of events, she speaks of 
events which throw a clearer light upon this and that circum 
stance, and enable us better to see through the otherwise 
inexplicable character of General Burgoyne. 

Mrs. General Iliedesel arrived in the evening with the army 



1 Von Gall adds, " All, so far as I know, is entirely true. 1 Note to\the original. 



IN TllK AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 211 

at Saratoga wet and hungry. There was great confusion and 
excitement, and she was unable to find a place to sleep. She 
sat down with her children by a fire in order to dry her clothes, 
and then laid down on some straw. An English officer brought 
her a bowl of soup. 

It appeared singular to her that the English general should 
intend remaining there, and upon her expressing her fears con 
cerning the delay to Greneral Phillips, he answered : " Poor 
woman ! I wonder at you, although completely drenched, you 
yet have courage to think of going farther in this weather. I 
would that you were our commanding general. He considers 
himself too fatigued to go farther, and intends staying here all 
night and give us a supper." Burgoyne actually caroused here 
half the night. He was hilarious with champagne, caressing 
the wife of a commissary who was his mistress. 1 This was 
probably the cause of his remaining so long at this place, thus 
losing the precious time necessary for his retreat. While Bur 
goyne was enjoying his champagne and choice food, the army 
suffered the keenest want. 

The days which Madame Riedesel spent here, were, for her, 
the most terrible ones of the whole war. We will not enter any 
more into details, but refer the reader to her book in which she 
describes everything with her natural simplicity and humility. 
The wife of the wounded Major Harnach, Madame Reynolds, 
who had lost her husband, the wife of the lieutenant, who had 
given some of his soup to Mrs. Riedesel, and the wife of a com 
missary, Burgoyne s mistress, were the only ladies who were 
now with the army. 

All the captured generals were obliged to repair to the enemy s 
camp after the capitulation. As soon as Riedesel arrived in the 
American camp, he sent for his wife. While riding with fear 
and anxiety through the camp, she took new courage from the 



1 This fact which Mrs. Riedesel mentions in her Journal is confirmed by the 
journals of several of the German officers who served in this campaign. Vi le 
the Auxiliaries in America by Eelking. 
fact that the soldiers looked at her in a friendly manner and 
saluted her. Upon her arrival at the tents of the superior offi 
cers, a tall, good looking man approached her and took the 
children from the carriage, hugging and kissing them. She 
was then led by him into the tent of General Gates, by whom 
she was received in a friendly manner. To her great astonish 
ment, she met here Generals Burgoyne l and Phillips. The 
former was of good cheer, and seemed to be very familiar with 
General Gates. The American officer who had first met Mrs. 
Biedesel in the enemy s camp, was General Schuyler. 

We will not here speculate whether a brave army was led to 
ruin by the incapacity or the wantonness of its leader, or in 
consequence of a badly arranged plan. In consequence of the 
affair near Saratoga, the mother country lost her best colonies, 
for from this time the power and the confidence of the Ameri 
cans grew daily; the independence of the provinces being 
already as good as decided. 

As has been already seen, English generals and historians 
either were not impartial enough, or not sufficiently informed 



1 General Burgoyne was the natural son of Lord Lingley, and possessed, with a 
prepossessing exterior, the fine and sagacious manners of a courtier. He was 
witty and brave, and was, therefore, never in want of friends. In the year 1762, he 
led an English corps in Portugal with some success, in consequence of which his 
friends thought not a little of his military abilities. But personal coxirage does not 
constitute a commander ; for of a commander we expect other qualities, especially 
experience and presence of mind. General Burgoyne lacked both. In all his 
undertakings he was hasty and self-willed, desiring to do everything alone, he 
hardly ever consulted with others ; and yet he never knew how to keep a plan 
secret. Being a great sybarite, he often neglected the duties of a commander as 
well toward his king as toward his subordinates. He could easily make light of 
everything provided he was eating a good meal, or was with his mistress. Thus, 
immediately after the capitulation, he could eat and drink with the enemy s gene 
rals, and could talk with the greatest ease of the most important events. But 
what a responsibility had he not taken upon himself ? What could he expect in the 
future? What a difference did not General Riedesel find when comparing him 
with Duke Ferdinand, the thorough commander, the moral and kind philanthro 
pist ! General Burgoyne, soon after the surrender, returned to England. He was 
received very coolly at first by the court and the people, and was forced to give up 
his salary. But he had the good fortune never to have his crimes investigated by 
a court martial. Afterwards he became the favorite of the queen and wrote plays. 
He died in YlW. Note to the original. 



AV THE A MEE1 CAN REVOL UTION. 213 

to acknowledge the merits of the Germans. The brave General 
Riedesel felt this keenly. With a noble self-denial he sets aside 
his own glory to preserve that of his troops, but as he has never 
published anything regarding it, and -never intrusted any one 
with his documents a great deal is lost in obscurity and doubt. 
The historical works relating to this war were mostly written by 
English, French or Americans, and were only afterwards trans 
lated into German, and we have consequently related many 
things in the same manner as they were told us. Many of 
these things consist of documents and additions ; and we, there 
fore, ask the reader to pardon what is often necessary repetitions. 

If General Riedesel complains of the partiality of the English general, he does not do it without good reasons. Look, for 
instance, at the letter of Burgoyne ta Lord Germain. In it we 
find more of a justification than a report. He pays all regard 
to the English, but none to the German troops. Conspicuous 
in this report are the following points : 

First. General Burgoyne does not admit that on the 19th of 
September, the German troops saved the English near Free 
man s farm, the latter being already beaten. 

Secondly. The German troops on the 7th of October, bear 
all the blame for the Americans having been allowed to pene 
trate into the English camp. He has no excuse for them, and 
yet by his own doings, the left flank of Breymann s corps was 
exposed to the enemy without the knowledge of the Germans. 

Thirdly. He makes no mention of the fact that the bateaux 
were captured through the negligence of an English detach 
ment, and that four English companies, by a like mistake, were 
taken prisoners at Ticonderoga a short time afterward. 

Fourthly. He does not admit that on the 7th of October, 
during the great reconnoitering expedition, the German troops 
held the dangerous position near the enemy s camp, after the 
defeat of the English Grenadiers on the left wing. 

The public in England, as well as the loyalists in America, 
were very much prejudiced against the German troops by these 



214 MAJOR GENERAL R1EDESEL 

false reports, as is plainly expressed by General Riedesel in his 
remarks. 



On the 20th of October, the captured General Riedesel bid 
adieu to the family of General Schuyler by whom he had been 
so hospitably entertained ; and, with his family, continued his 
journey from Albany, riding in the same coach with his wife 
and children. His health had already suifered considerably, 
not only by continual bivouacking and other exposures, but by 
mental emotions caused by the misfortune to his brave troops. 
He was now constantly depressed in spirits, and suffered from 
headache and general physical debility. He overtook his troops 
at Kinder s hook, where they encamped in the woods. They were 
now fifty-two English miles from Stillwater. 

On the 23d, the men had a day of rest. Kinder s hook was a 
small, pleasant village, formerly settled by the Dutch, most of 
whom were loyal. 

On the 24th, bivouacked near Nobletown. 

On the 25th, they arrived at Great Barrington, where, for 
the first time during the march, they obtained shelter in barns. 
Hitherto the roads leading through valleys had been good, but 
now the road led over mountains in the green woods, which are 
connected with the Green mountains. They grew constantly 
worse ; and the commander of the escort, not being a good 
soldier, directed the march toward the best taverns. All the 
expostulations of General Riedesel were in vain, the com 
mander, only intent upon having everything as comfortable as 
possible for his men. After reaching the mountains, a terrible 
rain storm made the roads worse yet. The teams, also, for the 
transportation of the provisions and the sick, were to have been 
changed at Great Barrington ; but as they had not been ordered 
previously it was impossible to collect them. An unnecessary 
halt, therefore, had to be made. Finally, a sufficient number of 
toams were gathered to carry the provisions, but the sick were 



IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 215 

obliged to remain there in charge of commissioned and noncom 
missioned officers. A commissary, by the name of Thillemann, 
a German by birth, remained behind to send them forward 
afterwards. This person took a great deal of pains to induce 
German soldiers to desert and enlist in the American army. 

On this day, the troops marched fifteen miles and were forced 
to encamp near Spring s house in terrible weather. Several of 
the men had already remained behind, in consequence of fatigue 
and want of shoes. On the day following the number of the lag- 
garts increased, the march being fourteen miles. The troops 
encamped again in the woods near Grey s house. On the 28th, 
they were to have arrived at West Springfield, but the weather 
being bad and cold it snowing and hailing considerably 
they only reached Westfield. The march was so disorderly that 
prisoners and men belonging to the escort remained behind, and, 
in consequence, lost their way. General Iliedesel finally suc 
ceeded, by making friends with the inhabitants, in finding quarters 
for his men. Two German soldiers were frozen to death on this 
day in the woods. 

On the 29th, the prisoners arrived at West Springfield. By 
entreaties and various representations, General Riedesel succeeded in obtaining quarters for his weary and half frozen 
soldiers. On this day, they advanced only four miles. A day 
of rest was here given to the soldiers. 

On the 31st, the general went across the Connecticut river to 
East Springfield to make arrangements with the authorities at 
that place for a supply of provisions. In the meantime the 
troops remained at West Springfield, a rest that was very accept 
able to them, as it give them a chance to repair their torn cloth 
ing, shoes, etc. 

General Riedesel, however, did not find the people of East 
Springfield as obliging as those at West Springfield. Notwith 
standing all his entreaties, he failed to induce them to quarter 
his troops. They were, accordingly, obliged to continue their 
march as far as Palmer, a distance of thirteen miles. 



216 MAJOR GENERAL R1EDE8EL 

On the 2d of November, they were obliged again to encamp 
near Brookfield, after a march of sixteen miles. Here the 
English regiments were again met with ; and it was resolved 
that hereafter they should keep a day s march in advance of the 
Germans. 

After a great deal of discussion with a stubborn colonel, 
Hiedesel finally succeeded, after a march of eleven miles, in 
procuring quarters for his men at Leicester. 

On the next day, the 4th, the troops arrived at Worcester, 
after a march of eleven miles, and obtained decent quarters. 
Generals Burgoyne and Phillips, with Brigadier Glover, also 
arrived there at the same time. General Riedesel, who, in 
several letters, had already complained to the latter general of 
the conduct of Colonel Ileid, took this opportunity to have an 
interview with him, the good result of which was that hence 
forth, the prisoners were properly quartered. 

On the 5th, after a march of seventeen miles, the prisoners 
arrived at Marlborough. 

On the 6th, they arrived at West-town ; and finally, on the 
7th, after a march of sixteen miles, they reached the barracks 
at Cambridge near Boston. 

The barracks for the English troops were on Prospect hill ; 
those of the Germans on Winter hill. 1 They were in the most 
miserable condition. So far as regarded their provisions, the 
soldiers, it is true, were more contented, they being good and 
wholesome. Several of the officers were permitted to reside at 
Cambridge and Mystic, but no one was allowed to go to Boston. 
The American General Heath at first consented to the officers 
and soldiers going a mile beyond their barracks. This privi 
lege was afterward extended to three miles. 

During the journey, General Riedesel noted down several 
observations regarding the American army, especially its offi- 



1 The number of the English amounted to 2,300 ; that of the Germans to about 
1,900 men. Note to original. 



IN THE AMER1 UA N HE VOL UTLON. 217 

cers. That army had been gathered in the greatest haste ; and 

such thorough training and organization as is found in Europe, 

as a matter of course, could not be expected. Every citizen, 

who, out of patriotism or by the necessity of circumstances took 

up arms, joined the army without reference to position or 

wealth. Most of them were excellent marksmen ; and, knowing 

well the locality upon which they fought, knew how to make 

use of it in every way. Being hunters and farmers they were 

accustomed to exposure and endurance, and minded not fatigue 

and hardship. He who had the best capacity and the most 

influence was appointed leader. Thus generals were very often 

found among the Americans, who, when not otherwise engaged, 

despised no hard work, provided only they could make money. 

Thus, some of these generals carried on the noble profession of 

shoeniaking, a profession which, during the march, was very 

lucrative. In illustration of this, Mrs. Riedesel, in her journal, 

relates the following anecdote. An English officer, whose boots 

were entirely worn out, walked for some time alongside of one 

of the above mentioned generals who wore a pair of new ones. 

Says the Englishman, more in fun than earnest, " General, I 

would gladly give you a guinea for your boots. Immediately, 

the American general dismounted, took off his boots, and 

handed them to the Englishman, at the same time taking the 

money and the torn boots of the Englishman in exchange. He 

then mounted his horse and again rode on. 

General lliedesel, with his family, found shelter for the pre 
sent, in a farmhouse, 1 where he was forced to content himself 
with a room and a garret. Nothing but some straw could be 
found for a couch. Upon this some beds were thrown, the 
servants, meanwhile, sleeping in the hall. The landlord was

Riedesel house. On one of the window panes, scratched with a diamond, is 
the general s autograph. It is generally thought to be the handwriting of Mrs. 
Riedesel. A comparison, however, between her signature and her husband s shows 
conclusively that it is his own. 

28 



218 MAJOR GENERAL RIEDE8EL 

very kind, but his other half was a veritable dragon, doing 
everything to offend and annoy her obnoxious guests. But as 
it was impossible to find another place, they were obliged to 
put up with everything rather than be driven from the house. 

Their stay here lasted for three weeks ; after which Hiedesel 
came to Cambridge where he obtained nice quarters. A colony 
of aristocratic and rich people had settled in this part of the 
country; but being mostly royalists they were forced, by the 
course of political events, to leave their handsome houses, several 
of which were at this time vacant. The inhabitants were also 
divided into two opposing parties, viz : royalists and republicans. 
A middle party was unknown. The former, however, being in 
the minority, were often exposed to gross insults, as is often 
the case in such exciting times. As a natural sequence, brothers 
opposed brothers ] sons left their parents ; man and wife sepa 
rated. 

The life in these barracks, moreover, was miserable. They 
were poorly built ; the cold winds of November whistled through 
the cracks, and the rain and snow made inroads in many places. 
The poor soldiers suffered severely, being unable to protect 
their weary and half frozen limbs against the inclement weather. 
They had left behind them all the baggage which they could 
possibly spare when first starting on this unhappy retreat ; and 
the little which they had retained by them had either been 
gradually used up, or taken from them by the Americans by force 
and cunning. The misery of their situation also was increased 
by the fact that the governor of Boston, General Heath, con 
ducted himself in a manner anything but friendly toward the 
prisoners. He treated them with severity and harshness, thus 
making the fate of these miserable prisoners still more deplor 
able. As a natural consequence difficulties arose between this 
general and the commanders of the captured troops, a state of 
things that continued as long as the latter remained at Boston. 

According to the solemn promises given by General Gates, it 
was expected that the stay at Boston would be but of short 



IJf THE AMER1 CAN HE VOL UTION. 219 

duration. The poor soldiers, however, were very much deceived. 
Their real misery had only just begun. The beginning of their 
troubles is seen in the following letter from Riedesel to Bur- 
goyne : 

" A MOST HUMBLE REPRESENTATION. 

" Humanity as well as duty requires that we should attend to 
those soldiers who are entrusted to our care. In the sad situation in which we, as well as other officers are placed, we find 
ourselves obliged to call upon your excellency to take care of 
us, and better our situation by your representations. It is 
expressly stated in the treaty, which your excellency has ne 
gotiated with General Grates, that the officers should have 
decent lodging places in proportion to their rank. Instead, 
however, of this article being carried out, we have been sent to 
the most miserable barracks, erected of common boards, in 
which four, five and six officers are promiscuously lodged with 
out respect to rank. 

" Indeed, the greater number of the soldiers is so miserably 
lodged that they are unable to shelter themselves from cold and 
rain in this severe season of the year ; and in spite of the hand 
some promises arid the fact that they are here fourteen days, 
and notwithstanding, also, my offer, that the men would make 
the repairs themselves if the necessary materials were furnished, 
nothing has been provided for them yet. The soldiers, of whom 
twenty to twenty-four occupy the same barrack, are without 
light at night. Three of them sleep in the same bed. They 
receive, also, so little fuel that they can scarcely cook our 
rations, to say nothing of warming the cold rooms. In fact, 
they have not even considered it worth while to establish a rule 
by which the officers and privates, according to their rank, may 
receive fuel. 

" All these proper complaints cause general dissatisfaction 
among the troops ; and it is to be feared that the result will be 
desertion and disobedience for which we cannot be responsible. 
" Although we officers, belonging to the staff, think less of our 
own comfort than of that of the soldiers whom we command, yet we 
cannot deny that we are astonished at observing the care that has 
been taken of the lodgings of the English general officers, while 
we have not even been thought of. We know the justice and 
honor of your excellency too well to allow us to doubt for a 
moment that these just representations will be considered by 
you, and that you will see to it that the troops receive that 
which belongs to them by right of treaty. We believe that it 
is no more than justice to furnish the troops with the same 
rations, etc., as they have received during the winter of 1775, 
while in garrison in Boston. 

" We lay our fate in your hands and under your protection, 
and remain, with deep respect 

" Your excellency s, etc." 

Subsequently, General Burgoyne sent a dispatch to Sir Wil 
liam Howe, who was at Philadelphia at the time, in which he 
reported the miserable condition in which the troops were, 
requesting him at the same time to do all he could for them. 
Captain Valency carried the dispatch to General Howe. 

Congress, even as early as this, did not intend to keep the 
treaty which General Gates had made in his own name with 
the English general. The famous Marquis De Lafayette had 
arrived a short time previous to this in America, offering his 
assistance to the patriots, and joining their army as major 
general. France, intending at this time to declare war against 
England, was obliged to make common cause with the Ameri 
cans; and Lafayette, in the interest of his nation, advised congress not to send the prisoners to Europe, since they could be 
again used against France. General Heath, also, allowed the 
Bostonians to induce the soldiers to desert, even going so far 
as to aid them by making the situation of the prisoners as 
unpleasant as possible. 

We will here quote verbatim that which Riedesel says in his 



IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 221 

journal in regard to this. It reads as follows: "One would 
have believed that the people of America were better acquainted 
with the principles of the laws of nations, of military honor and 
public trust and faith ; but alas ! we learned differently! These 
pages will show the subterfuges which they used in making this 
treaty null and void; also, how they induced by hard, unjust, 
yea, we might say, treacherous methods, our men to join them. 
Again, how they would persuade them by false promises to 
embrace their side and thus cause our army to melt away gradu 
ally, by making part of it slaves to a detestable nation. Arid 
here, in fact, really lies the reason of all the troubles and difficulties which afterward arose between our commander and 
General Heath, to whose safe keeping our army had been com 
mitted." 

The camp of the prisoners was encircled by a chain of 
outposts. The officers, who were permitted to go somewhat 
beyond the camp, were obliged to promise in writing on their 
word of honor, to go no farther beyond it than a mile and a half. 
Within this space are the villages, Cambridge, Mystic or Med- 
ford, and a part of Charlestown. In these places the generals 
and brigadiers could select lodgings, for which, of course, they 
had to pay dearly. After a while this permission was extended 
to other staff and subaltern officers. Only a few of the Bruns- 
wickers availed themselves of this permission, preferring to 
remain in their miserable barracks, and thus share all inconveniences with their men. 

The camp was located on a height, which, to a distance of 
eight miles, was surrounded with woods, thus presenting a 
splendid view of Boston, the harbor and the vast ocean. The 
barracks had been built in 1775, at the time that the Americans 
first took up arms, and upon these very heights took their first 
position against General Gage. These heights were fortified. 

When the fatigued and worn out troops arrived here on the 
7th of November, they found not the least thing for their sup 
port. A little straw and some wood was everything that was 
furnished to the soldier. The officers and privates were obliged 
to repair the barracks as well as they could, although they had 
neither tools nor materials with which to do it. Necessity, 
however, which is the mother of invention, accomplished incredible things. 

The conduct of the German officers toward their soldiers, was, 
indeed, most exemplary. Both on the march and in the camp 
they sought to alleviate as much as possible the miseries of the 
troops, forgetting their own troubles. Thus many, who had 
still a little money left, bought boots and shoes for those of their 
men who were barefoot. A pair of second hand boots cost about 
four silver thalers. 1 During their journey, the Americans, in 
some instances, stole the knapsacks from these miserable beings 
who had carried them with great trouble thus far. They also 
stole about thirty horses. At Albany, all the baggage belonging to General Riedesel was stolen, and this too, although an 
American guard had been given him for its protection. Con 
sequently he and his family had nothing left but what they had 
carried on their backs. The English were treated in the same 
manner. During the march, prisoners most of whom had 
been captured near Bennington were met in almost every 
place. Some asked to be taken with the rest to Boston, while 
others, satisfied with their fate, wished to remain. Those Ger 
man officers who had been captured previously, were at West 
minster and Rutland. It was a short and painful meeting 
between old comrades. The prisoners were furnished with 
board and lodging for a remuneration by the people of Massa 
chusetts bay, but were obliged to assist at work. Some fared 
well, others ill, just as the fancy struck their host. 

On the 8th, General Heath came into the camp of the pri 
soners. He called upon all the generals, and, taking them to 
the city, gave them a dinner. Orders were also issued this day 
regarding the future treatment of the prisoners. Special regu- 



1 A thaler is equal to seventy cents in American money. 



IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 223 

lations were made for the officers which they had to sign on 
parole. They were obliged to promise to give neither direct nor 
indirect intelligence to the enemies of the United States, nor to 
say anything that could be in the least detrimental to the actions 
and provisions of congress. Finally, they were to obey the rules 
and regulations which had already been given them, and also 
those that should be given in future to the royal troops. This 
last point caused great indignation among all the officers, many 
refusing their signatures. Eight days passed before these latter 
could make up their minds to append their names ; but all repre 
sentations being in vain, and it being perceived that if they stood 
out they would have to share with the common soldiers their 
restricted space and be exposed to other extortions, they finally 
signed the obnoxious paper. 

The same day the following order appeared : " Major General 
Heath, commander of the eastern department, desirous of treating General Burgoyne and all officers of the army with politeness and generosity, and the soldiers with philanthropy and 
care, and for the preservation of order and harmony among the 
different troops, issues the following orders : 

" First. If an officer goes beyond the limits, he shall, for a 
punishment, be restricted to the narrower limits of the private 
soldier, or, according to circumstances, be placed on board a 
guard ship. 

" Secondly. All officers below the rank of staff officer shall 
be at their quarters by nine o clock in the evening. 

" Thirdly. Commissaries shall be appointed from whom the 
troops shall buy all their provisions at their original cost. Nor 
shall any of the troops buy anything from any person except 
these commissaries. 

" Fourthly. The officers shall carefully avoid all difficulties 
with the inhabitants, and in case they are insulted, shall carry 
their complaints to the proper place. 

" Fifthly. The servants of the officers, for whom their masters 
have signed the parole, are not allowed to go further from the 



224 MAJOR GENERAL RIEDE8EL 

quarters of their masters than to the sutlers, unless accom 
panied by their masters. 

" HEATH, Major General. 
" Boston, November 8, 1777." 

The German troops owed all the practical orders regarding 
the transportation of provisions to their general who, after 
many discussions finally carried his point with General Heath. 
They thereby obtained the necessaries of life easier and cheaper. 
This was also of advantage to the commanders as they were 
thus better able to keep their men together and prevent ex 
cesses and desertion. A great many of the English troops, 
who were not included in this order, had trouble daily, and 
numbers were arrested and transported to the guard ships. 

The prisoners camp had many visitors daily, who came not 
only from Boston and vicinity, but from far and near. Some 
times the curiously inquisitive would come a distance of one 
hundred miles to see the foreigners. Thus it occasionally 
happened that the Americans secretly took the opportunity to. 
bring into camp renegade prisoners in civilian s clothing, that 
the latter might picture the pleasant life they enjoyed and 
induce desertion. The Americans did this from economical 
motives j for there being a great want of working men, they 
used the prisoners like slaves. 

On the llth, General Riedesel issued a general order in 
regard to the interior of the camp. The companies were made 
to form in line twice a day for muster and all communication 
between the prisoners and the Americans who guarded them 
was forbidden. The officers and subalterns were to enforce dis 
cipline and order, and especially prevent difficulties and quarrels. 
This regulation in the German camp was also beneficial in another 
respect, viz : that the Americans soon recognizing it, always sent 
those soldiers who were arrested to their respective regiments 
for punishment, while they themselves punished the English 
soldiers by sending them to the guard house. For the purpose 



IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 225 

moreover, of bettering the miserable condition of the clothing, 
lliedesel ordered the tails to be cut off the coats that the waists 
might be mended with them. Thus coats became jackets. 

General Heath allowed passes to be issued to the servants of 
officers permitting them to go alone as far as the boundaries 
prescribed for their masters. The adjutant general of Heath, 
by the name of Keith, soon made this a paying business, asking 
a paper thaler for every pass. In order to increase his profits, 
he soon extended the permission to subalterns and privates, who 
were thus also allowed to go beyond the American outposts into 
the neighboring villages. 

Every day a staff officer was sent upon each of the hills, 
charged with the special superintendence of it. All difficulties 
were brought to him for settlement. On Thursdays and Sun 
days the regiments gathered for a sort of parade, when they 
were inspected by tlie generals. This was done with the usual 
precision, the generals walking between the open lines and 
inspecting the mended clothing with the same particularity as 
they would, had it been the handsomest uniform. Thus order 
and cleanliness was maintained among the. soldiers. 

Not even the sick came under shelter, but were sent to the 
special barracks where they died more of cold than disease. 

The American colonel. Lee, a very sociable man, was made 
commander of Cambridge. It was his duty to inspect two of 
the hills. Over him was a so called town major, by name 
Browne, who, as late as 1775, had served as a subaltern officer 
in the 47th English regiment, but who afterward deserted. 
This man was easily bribed ; and hating the English more than 
the Germans, he was much more obliging -to the latter. 

On the 20th of November, Boston was in a joyous commotion. 
From the towers pealed forth the bells ; and from the batteries 
thundered the guns, which in turn were answered by those in 
the harbor. Houses and ships were decked with flags and 
banners. All these demonstrations were in consequence of the 
arrival of the president of the province, by the name of HAN- 
29 
COCK, who had honored the city with a visit. Notwithstanding 
the so called patriots did not wish to have anything to do with 
the king, yet in presence of the prisoners, they called the 
president KING HANCOCK in order to tantalize them. Im 
partial men, who knew the president, said that his riches and 
his partiality rather than his talents had helped him in reaching 
this high position. The delegates of the townships met in 
Boston in their gala dresses on this occasion. Of these original 
people, as well as of the inhabitants of New England, the 
general gives the following description : 

" One can see in these men, here assembled, exactly the 
national character of the inhabitants of New England. They 
are distinguished from the rest by their manner of dress.. Thus 
they all, under a thick, round, yellow wig, bare the honorable 
physiognomy of a magistrate. Their dress is after the old 
English fashion. Over this they wear, winter and summer, a 
blue blouse, with sleeves, which is fastened round the body by 
a strap. One hardly ever sees any of them without a whip. 
They are generally thickset, and middling tall ; and it is dim- 
cull to distinguish one from another. Not one-tenth of them 
can read writing, and still fewer can write. This art belongs, 
aside from the literary men, exclusively to the female sex. The 
women are well educated \ and, therefore, know better than 
any other matrons in the world how to govern the men. The 
New Englanders all want to be politicians, and love, therefore, 
the taverns and the grog bowl ; behind the latter of which 
they transact business, drinking from morning till night. They 
are extremely inquisitive, credulous and zealous to madness for 
liberty ; but they are, at the same time, so blind that they can 
not see the heavy yoke imposed upon them by their congress, 
under which they are already sinking." 

General Burgoyne seems to have cared more for the welfare 
of his troops after the misfortune near Saratoga had overtaken 
him than before. He ordered from Rhode island winter 
clothing for the soldiers, which cost a great deal of money. 



AY THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 227 

The supply sent over scarcely sufficed to clothe one-eighth of 
the army j nevertheless, he had this divided equally among the 
two nationalities, and ordered more from New York. 

On the 13th of December, Captain Valency, who had been 
sent by Burgoyne the beginning of November to General Howe, 
returned with an answer from the latter to the effect that he 
had given orders to have the necessary transports got in readiness as quickly as possible to take the troops back to Europe. 
This news circulated quickly, not only in the camp but in the 
province of Massachusetts bay where the rest of the prisoners 
were quartered. Many of the latter left their quarters, and came 
into camp to go with their companions to Europe. As soon, 
however, as General Heath received intelligence of this fact, he 
issued orders for all such prisoners to return at once to their 
quarters. As a matter of course, this order had to be obeyed. 

Desertion among the English had now increased to such an 
extent, that toward the end of December about four hundred 
men were missing. Among the Germans, however, there were 
only ten desertions. 

Toward the latter part of this month, the transports, sent by 
General Howe under the command of Commodore Dalrymple. 
arrived at Cape Cod. Congress had already broken the treaty, 
under the flimsy pretense that the troops could not depart until 
the king of England had signed the treaty. Accordingly when 
Commodore Dalrymple reported to General Heath his arrival 
and the reason for it, he received the answer that the resolution 
of congress was final. General Burgoyne, also, received the 
same answer to his demand respecting the embarkation of the 
troops ; and the English flotilla was obliged to return to Khode 
island without having accomplished anything. General Bur 
goyne, thereupon, sent one of his adjutants, Captain Welford, 
with a letter to congress, in which he insisted upon the fulfillment of the treaty, at the same time pointing out the bad 
consequences which might arise if congress should act contrary 
to its stipulations. Captain Welford was, also, to support the 



228 MAJOR GENERAL RIEDE8EL 

demand of the English general by verbal representations. 
Another letter was given him by Burgoyne in which congress 
was petitioned, in case of its not permitting the departure of 
the troops, to allow the bearer, Captain Welford, to return to 
England on account of sickness and family affairs. He promised 
that if congress should at any future time recall him he would 
at once return to America. Burgoyne, also, gave him a second 
urgent letter to General Washington supporting his request. 

In the meantime the prisoners received other intelligence 
through the newspapers and the inhabitants, which caused the 
prospects of their speedy release to grow even fainter for it 
was said that the troops would not be allowed to depart until 
the king of England, in due form, acknowledged the independence of the United States. 

On the 31st, Major Von Mengen received the command of 
the grenadier battalion, Captain Von Poluitz succeeding him 
in the command of his old regiment. 

Paymaster General Godecke being still in Canada with the 
military chest, a great want of money was experienced. Desirous of mitigating this evil, Riedesel thought of the common 
man s interest first. He, therefore, issued a circular, on the 
31st of December, to all the German commanders, requesting 
them to see to it that the subalterns and privates received their 
pay first. They were further requested to borrow the necessary 
funds in some way, either from officers or from soldiers who 
had any to spare. Certificates, signed by Burgoyne and the 
English paymaster, were given to those persons who advanced 
money. Riedesel, himself advanced all the money he could 
spare. In this way enough was collected to enable the poor 
man to meet his expenses. 



Let us now cast a slight retrospect over the events that had 
thus far occurred during this war. Immediately after the be 
ginning of the campaign, General Washington, breaking through 




AV THE AMERICAN DEVOLUTION. 221) 

the English lines at Trenton, beat General Cornwallis on the 3d 
of January, near Princeton. A short time after this General 
Prescott was beaten by the American Lieutenant Colonel Barlow. 
The English were consequently forced to evacuate New Jersey. 
Howe did not succeed in his intended assault upon Philadel 
phia by water. He met Washington on land by the Brandywinc 
river, and defeated him on the 13th of September. Afterward 
he occupied Philadelphia. General Howe, however, not knowing 
how to take advantage of his victories, soon relapsed into his usual 
inactivity. The Americans acted better, and, accordingly, endea 
vored to augment their forces as much as possible. In addition 
to this, Marquis Lafayette (as already mentioned), Duplessis, 
Kosciusko, Pulaski and other thorough officers, came from Eu 
rope and offered their services to the Americans, which were 
gladly accepted. Thus the year 1777 passed, a year, which, for 
the army of Canada, began splendidly, but ended shamefully. 

For the purpose of giving a better idea of the strength of 
both armies that were in the northern section of the country, 
we here append the following lists. This appears the more 
necessary, for the reason that those historical works, generally, 
which treat on the North American war, either give the numbers differently and incorrectly, or do not give them at all. 

The American army near Saratoga under General Gates, 
consisted, on the 17th of October, of 3 major generals, 12 
brigadier generals, 44 colonels, 49 majors, 344 captains, 332 
first lieutenants, 326 second lieutenants, 345 ensigns, 5 chap 
lains, 42 adjutants, 44 quarter masters, 30 paymasters, 37 doc 
tors, 43 assistant doctors, 1,392 sergeants, 636 drummers, 
13,216 subaltern officers and privates, 662 sick in their rooms, 
and 131 sick at the hospital, 3,875 belonging to the rear guard, 
and 180 on furlough : total, 22,350 men. In actual service, 
20,817. 

The royal British army, under General Burgoyne, consisted, 
on the 17th of October, inclusive of the Brunswick and Hessian 
troops, of 1 major general, 2 brigadier generals, 5 lieutenant 
colonels, 10 majors, 63 captains, 80 first lieutenants, 60 second 
lieutenants, 11 under lieutenants and ensigns, 8 adjutants, 7 
quarter masters, 8 armorers, 4 auditors, 13 doctors, 4 scribes, 
59 drummer majors, hautboys and players, 6 provosts, 359 non 
commissioned officers, 26 assistant physicians, 210 drummers, 
4,538 soldiers, 327 servants : total, 5,801 men. Note: Generals 
Burgoyne, Phillips and Hamilton are not included in this list. 1 
The grenadiers and light infantry formed eight companies of 
the 29th, 31st, 34th and 53d Regiments which were in Canada. 
The number of the other companies of grenadiers and light 
infantry, which were with the army, were distributed among 
their respective regiments. - 

Losses of the Brunswick troops from the beginning of the 
campaign of 1777, until December the 1st of the same year, not 
including those captured at Saratoga :

formed of these regiments before leaving Canada. This remained in Canada under 
the command of General Carleton. The troops that were dispatched to Ticonderoga 
and other places are included here. Note to original.

is " captured on discretion."

OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS 

RELATING TO 

GENERAL RIEDESEL S CAMPAIGN IN AMERICA. 



CORRESPONDENCE OF GENERAL RIEDESEL WITH THE HEREDITARY 
PRINCE, AND AFTERWARDS REIGNING DUKE, CHARLES WILLIAM 
FERDINAND, OF BRUNSWICK, LUNEBERG. 

LA PRAIRIE, July 31, 1776. 
To His Serene Highness, the Hereditary Prince : 

I hope that your serene highness has received favorably my last 
frank letter ; but to no other do I give my confidence. Your highness knows best under what circumstances this corps was intrusted 
to me, and, therefore, I can communicate my thoughts to yourself 
alone. 

Thank God, I have so far succeeded with the drill of the two 
battalions, which are with me, that I can show them to General 
Carleton on his return from Quebec ; and I hope that he will do 
them justice in spite of his national love for the English troops of 
whose praises he is full. All the English officers who have seen us, 
praise us highly. 

Everything goes well as long as the ranks are closed for a charge ; 
but when we open the ranks and the middle line is visible, then I am 
ashamed. We must, however, make as much of it as we can ; and 
if you were here, you would admit that as much as was possible has 
been accomplished with the men. 

Our army, at present, is completely inactive. This was very 
welcome to me four weeks ago, in order to give time to set the regiments to rights ; but now I wish that we would soon start. We are 
mostly in need of armed sloops and bateaux. There is much talk, 
but whether the work is pushed through with the same zeal is quite 
another question. 



The foot notes to these documents, unless otherwise noted, are as given in the 
original. Translator.

234 OFFICIAL D CUMENTS RE LA TING 

Everything depends upon the expedition of General Howe. If he 
lands safely, captures New York, and gains a footing, we can cross 
the lake with a few brigades, one after the other. We have a sufficient number of bateaux for this purpose ; but if Howe meets with 
resistance, and if his operations are prolonged, then the whole plan 
will require a second campaign for its complete execution. In the 
former case we will certainly have peace this coming winter ; but in 
the latter event, another campaign, which cannot possibly be unsuc 
cessful, as the rebels are unable to oppose both armies, and their 
soldiers are not what they were thought to be in Germany. They 
are a miserable race of men, with poor officers. They have no 
money, only paper ; and there is such an excitement and tremble in 
the provinces themselves, that it is impossible for the confederation 
to last long. 

Nothing can be learned here in regard to position ; for I believe 
that there is no place in the whole of America, where six battalions 
could be placed in good position. Aside from the few cultivated 
regions on the rivers, all the hills are covered with woods. All we 
can do, therefore, is to post ourselves near rivers, take forts, and build 
new ones, and go with the Indians as much as possible through the 
primeval forests in order to destroy communications. It may, how 
ever, be practicable, when everything is in readiness, to attack the 
enemy wherever he is to be found, without regard to his position. 
We can also study out great manoeuvres. And even after the enemy 
is beaten, it will be impossible to pursue him, while the ships will 
have to be transported across the land to another river, or new ones 
built. In either case, however, it will cost money ; and if a mistake 
is made in regard to the amount of provisions, we will have to return 
for them even if the enemy does not compel us to do so. 

But little attention is paid to the men, it being thought that they 
are taken care of if they have plenty of bread and meat. Beer, brandy, 
vegetables, and straw for bedding are all unknown. Thus the soldier 
gets tired of his constant diet of meaty and during a march from one 
river to another, the officer has to live the same as a private. Such 
marches, however, cannot last long, as they are only over what is 
called portages, from five to six, or at most, ten leagues. 

Hoping that your highness will receive this favorably, 

I remain, etc., 

RlEDESEL. 



TO GEN. RIEDESEUS CAMPAIGN. 235 



THE HEREDITARY PRINCE TO GENERAL RIEDESEL. 

BRUNSWICK, September 14, 1776. l 
Right Honorable Sir and Highly Respected Major General : 

I had the pleasure of receiving two of your letters, the last of which 
is dated July the 5th. In this, I observe, with special satisfaction, 
the well being of yourself and corps, after so tedious a journey. 
Your honor knows as well as any one, that not only the haste but the 
stubbornness which Mr. Faucit has manifested, and still manifests, are 
the cause of so much being needed for the comfort of the corps. 
But I feel confident that your attention, zeal and activity in the 
service, will go far toward placing matters on a tolerable footing. 
Discipline among the officers is certainly the safest means to bring 
this about. The uniforms for the first division have already been 
sent, and those for the second will be shipped before the end of this 
month, so that there will be no lack for these most necessary articles. 
As regards the recruits, we will see to it, as soon as enlistments begin 
again, that you have sent to you strong and robust fellows if possible, not below five feet two inches. It will be, as you know, im 
possible to warrant their zeal in the service, but strict discipline, 
which I know you make a point to have, will be the best means of 
making them attend to their duty. The sacrifice, which this country 
has been obliged to make in consequence of the bad condition in 
which it has been, has been so great, that unless we exterminate whole 
generations we cannot extend enlistments over our own subjects. The 
misery of the wives and children left behind by the soldiers is so 
lamentable that they would starve did they not receive food from the 
barracks here, and this, notwithstanding the allowance mothers 
receive from the government. The landgrave of Hessia and the 
hereditary prince of Hanau have certainly considered from every 
point of view the best manner in which to treat their subjects which 
are committed to their care ; and it is certainly for the interest of the 
funds to furnish recruits for whom money is received, and none 
expended. They also believe that they have thoroughly considered 
the duties of a sovereign toward his subjects : and I believe that a 
free-born man cannot be forced, unless it be for the defense of the 
fatherland by taking arms against the inhabitants of Canada. 

I am not surprised that the colonists have evacuated Mont-Real, 
Chambly and St. John, for first, they were weak in that region if 



1 On the back of this letter is the indorsement, " answered June 1, 1777. 1 



236 OFFl CIAL D CUMENTS EEL A TING 

they rallied strongly in Virginia and Carolina, and secondly, the 
country was not with them. 

The descendants of the French and the Christianized Indians, who 
are Roman Catholics, are used to submission and blind obedience ; 
and their intelligence is satisfied, if he who governs them lets them 
alone. But it is different with the colonies, which are English ; and 
if the leaders understand their business but half, the thing will not be 
so easily settled. 1 Even if Carleton captures Crown point, which I 
hardly doubt, the colonists have only to prolong the matter as long 
as possible, in order to cause a great scarcity of provisions and men 
in the English army. 

The second division, in my opinion, will arrive at Quebec the fore 
part of August, and I long for news concerning it. 

I had the honor of making the personal acquaintance of Field 
Marshal Romanzow at Berlin. He was there with the grand duke 
who, as you know, married again after the death of his first wife, the 
princess of Wurtemberg, the daughter of Prince Eugene, who resides 
at Montbeillard. 

I desire you to give my thanks to Captain Gerlach for his two 
letters, and for drawing the plans. I will write him at the first 
opportunity. I am now just setting out for Potsdam. You are, I 
believe, informed of the ill health of the duke. The least mental 
excitement may bring us a great misfortune. 

I am, sir, most respectfully, 

Your obedient servant, 

CHARLES. 



LETTERS OF GENERAL RIEDESEL TO THE DUKE FERDINAND OF 
BRUNSWICK, LtiNEBERG.2 

THREE RIVERS, June 1, 1777. 3 
Monseigneur : 

I had the honor of receiving five gracious letters from your serene 
highness before the departure of my last letter of the 10th of last 
month ; and I am thus enabled to again make mention of their safe 
arrival. Since then I have been so fortunate as to receive two more 



1 It will be noticed that the hereditary prince, though so far from the theatre of 
operations, had a much better appreciation of the magnitude of the war, than 
Riedesel or the English commanders. Translator. 

2 The originals of these letters are still preserved. The duke always marked the 
date of their reception on the margin. It is not, however, known how these letters 
got back again among the papers of Riedesel. 

3 Received August 2 ; answered August 10, 1777. 



TO GEN. RIEDESEUS CAMPAIGN. 237 

letters from your highness, one dated the 20th, and one the 27th of 
September, for which, and for the assurance of your kind feelings 
toward me, I express my humblest thanks. 

The English minister has suddenly changed the theatre of war to 
this vicinity. General Carleton has been deprived of the command 
of the army. He seems very indignant at this, and intends to enter 
a complaint with parliament against the injustice of the minister. 

General Burgoyne will assume the command after crossing into 
New York and after communications are restored between himself 
and General Howe. God knows what he will do with the Canadian 
army which has already been a whip to his ambition. 

A great deal is said concerning the army of General Howe, especially in regard to its discipline. But I know not how much we can 
believe of these reports, for it always seems to me that all is not gold 
that glitters, and Colonel McLean had to wait there l for five days to 
receive orders for the Canadian army. 

To-morrow I shall leave Three Rivers ; and the army will march 
in two columns for Crown point the Germans on the left, and the 
English on the right and I hope we will arrive there about the 13th 
of this month. I hope, also, that rny reports will soon become more 
interesting, and that I shall be able to announce the capture of Carillon. 2 

Your serene highness will, in the continuation of this journal, find 
everything in regard to the position of the army ; also, the latest 
news which we have received from the army of General Howe, and 
the present arrangements for the movements of our army during the 
coming campaign. I will, therefore, not trouble your highness 
further with repetition. 

Lord Percy, indignant at General Howe, has returned to England, 
and I suppose that General Carleton will do the same thing before 
the close of this year. 

The arrangements for the march forbid me writing any further ; 
but my first report will certainly be very explicit. 

I remain, etc., 

RIEDESEL.

CEOWN POINT, June 28, 1777. 

I am not able to express to you my gratitude for the care with 
which your highness answers my reports, and, perhaps, no one else 
can show so many answers from yourself as 

By the appointment of another commander in chief of the army, 
the theatre of war is so changed that it does not now look like the 
same one. The new one judges somewhat hastily, and carries out 
the plan of the ministers. His predecessor went to work more care 
fully but safely, and made no more until he w r as convinced it could 
be carried out. The result will show who was right in the present 
situation. 

The rebels still hold Carillon with an army of from 3,000 to 4,000 
men ; and I believe we shall have to undertake a siege. We still 
lack, however, ammunition, and the most necessary things for this 
purpose. The season of the year keeps us here. It is lamentable 
that the requisite things for this campaign have not been sent here 
from England until so late. Consequently, a large portion of the 
time that should have been devoted to the campaign, passes by, and 
thus this expensive war is prolonged. 

My wife, with her three children, has finally arrived in perfect 
health. They reached Canada on the llth of June, and none of 
them suffered the least on the voyage. She speaks of this long voyage 
as a mere trifle. I was so fortunate as to see her at Three Rivers, 
where she will occupy my old quarters until circumstances provide 
her a safer place in New York. The children speak nothing but 
English, and no one takes them for Germans. She requests me, to 
request your highness graciously to remember them. 

That you may see more plainly the movements of the army, I add 
here the continuation of the journal. 

I remain, etc., 

RlEDESEL.

FORT EDWARD, August 8, 1777. 

I have the honor of sending your highness the continuation of the 
journal in which you will see that we are masters of the Hudson ; 
also, that the enemy has evacuated all the advantageous positions 
which he might still have held. Besides this, all the three rapids 1 
are in our possession ; and we can now place all our ships on the 
river, and have a clear passage to Albany. The rest of our position, 
you will see in the journal which I have the honor of inclosing in 
this letter. Matters are at present, at such a point, that everything, 
perhaps, can be decided in two different ways. Mr. Washington is 
falling back before General Howe; and Mr. Arnold is retreating upon Albany. 

Should our army adopt measures to prevent its defeat a con 
tingency which would weaken us then we may expect either that, 
with our army in high spirits, the rebels will shortly be surrounded, 
or that a decisive victory will put an end to the entire campaign. 

I hope to be able to communicate to your highness, in my next 
letter, several interesting items of news, and, among them, that the 
troops of my gracious master have given fresh proofs of their good 
will, and their desire to fight for the glory of their nation. 

I have the honor, etc., 

RlEDESEL.

JOHN S FARM, August 28, 1777. 1 

Fortune not being on one side every day, the expedition of Lieu 
tenant Colonel Baum, supported by Lieutenant Colonel Breymann, 
has not, therefore, met with the same good result as the affair near 
Hubbardstown. But it was not because the troops did not fight just 
as bravely. The distance between these two corps of our army 
enabled the enemy to attack Baum with eight times greater numbers ; 
and, in spite of all the exertions of Breymann, he was unable to re- 
enforce Baum at the right time. I do not doubt but that this was 
the second part of the affair at Hubertstown. You will see the 
account of this sad aifair better in the journal, which I have the 
honor of inclosing. It may be that my gracious master, the duke, 
will communicate to your serene highness, the detailed reports which 
I have sent to him, in order that he might take under his protection 
the commanders of both corps, and might see that our troops did 
their duty on that occasion. The transportation of provisions over 
the three rapids, still detains our army at this place. The rebels are 
fortified at Half-moon, ten English miles this side of Albany ; but I 
believe that we shall soon advance against them whenever the largest 
portion of our provisions have crossed the rapids. Although our 
army is considerably weakened by the sending out of detachments, 
and the bad result of the affair of the 16th, I believe that we shall 
attack the enemy, providing he remains at Half-moon. Thus four 
teen days will decide the result; and I hope that we shall at least 
make up for the losses we have lately sustained. 

I remain, etc , 

RlEDESEL.

REPORTS OF GENERAL RIEDESEL TO THE REIGNING DUKE, CHARLES OF BRUNSWICK, LUNEBURG. 1 

On the voyage to Freyburg road, 

SHIP PALLAS, March 21, 1776. 

Most illustrious Duke ; most gracious Prince and Lord : 

I report to your serene highness that, in consequence of contrary 
winds, we are still riding at anchor in the road at the confluence of 
the Elbe and Schwinge. Yesterday, ten ships sailed for Freyburg 
with a favorable wind. We may, perhaps, follow this afternoon if 
the change of tide brings an auspicious wind. The ships at Frey 
burg are to wait for us, as the direction of the voyage depends on 
our vessel. 

The wind now begins to blow ; the anchors are hoisted ; and we 
will start for Freyburg, whence we shall sail for England with the 
first favorable wind. 

I am now able to give your serene highness a general idea of the 
proposed plan of operations. All the troops that are destined for 
Canada, and of which the first Brunswick division will be the first, 
start for the River St. Lawrence. It remains to be seen whether 
Quebec is still in possession of the English, and w T hether the rebels 
have occupied it with an army. If Quebec is yet ours, then the troops 
will be disembarked there, and await the arrival of the second division and the other troops, which, together, will make an army of 
14,000 men. Upon reaching America they will encamp upon the 
island of Orleans, where a camp will very probably have been pre 
pared for their reception. Thence, having reembarked, they will 
sail up the river, toward Lac St. Pierre, to Montreal. This latter city 
is in the worst possible condition ; and every one claiming to be in 
command of it, it is said that it would be an easy matter to compel 
its surrender. Near Montreal is a trajet* of eight German miles, 
which has to be crossed on land. The empty ships will proceed on 
the river Sorel, and we will embark again on Lake Champlain, when 
we will sail up the lake to Fort Crown Point, which place the rebels, 
also, have in their possession. This fortification, however, is said to 
be a most miserable one, and will easily be demolished by the numerous cannon of Colonel Phillips in a few days. With the capture of 
this fort our expedition for this year will very probably terminate. 

In case the Americans have an army at Montreal or Crown Point, 
a battle will take place at one of those points. This, however, is 
doubtful, since Canada cannot furnish a sufficient quantity of pro 
visions for an army, and inasmuch, also, as the Canadians cannot be 
trusted by the Americans. Should Quebec have surrendered and 
Carleton been captured, then it is to be ascertained whether the city 
is occupied by only a few thousand men, or whether congress has 
sent a large army to occupy not only Quebec but the surrounding 
country, especially the island of Orleans. The latter supposition is 
said to be almost impossible, and is doubted. In the first case, I, with 
the first Brunswick division which will be the first to arrive, will 
disembark on the island Orleans and ascertain if a descent can be 
made on the coast of Quebec itself, and if the heights, on which 
General Wolfe fought his battle, can be gained. 

Should Quebec be but weakly garrisoned by the rebels, it is 
thought to be an easy matter to retake the place from the side ; but 
this is only possible, provided we are accompanied by a transport of 
artillery. If, however, the garrison at Quebec is too strong, then we 
must stay on the island of Orleans and await there the arrival of the 
other English troops and the second division. And should it prove 
that a large rebel army is at Quebec, then we shall not be able to go 
even to this island, but will have to remain on the vessels, at the 
mouth of the St. Lawrence, until our entire army arrives. The ex 
pedition will then begin with the siege of Quebec ; and should this 
be begun, the season will probably pass without the capture by our 
troops of Montreal. 

The army of General Howe, with whom will be all the Hessian 
troops, will, after leaving 2,000 men at Boston, rendezvous on Long 
island, and make that place the basis of future operations. This army 
will go up the Hudson mostly by water, and thus also operate against 
Crown Point. Should this army succeed in placing itself between Northampton and Luneburg and remain master of the Hudson 
and Connecticut rivers, then the rebels not only will be cut in two, 
and the connection severed between Philadelphia and Cambridge, 
but the armies of Generals Carleton and Howe will be able to form a 
junction. 

The third expedition is to be undertaken by General Clinton and 
Lord Dunmore in Virginia. They are to ascertain if that province 
can be gained over to the royal cause by kind measures. In case 
they are successful in this, they will endeavor to form there a national 
army, make a junction with the royal troops, and then march against 
Maryland and New York. But should they not succeed in their efforts at conciliation, then Clinton is to reunite with Howe. For 
this reason English regiments only are to be employed on this expedition. 

This is the general plan. I will be able to send more particular 
news to your serene highness from England or rather from Spithead. 
Hoping that your serene highness will graciously remember me, 
I remain with deep devotion, 

Your highness s humble servant, 

RlEDESEL. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

Hoping that your highness has received my last report, I proceed 
to state the condition we are^in at present : 

The rebels still hold the city and island of Montreal where the 
river Richelieu empties into the St. Lawrence. The corps, which is 
to operate against Canada, numbers about 4,000 men, and is en 
camped near St. Johns. It is represented as being in the greatest 
consternation, and preparing to pack up and retreat. In that case 
our army, if the wind is favorable, can get there. 

All the English regiments, with the exception of one, either have 
gone or are going to Three Rivers, where is the rendezvous of the 
main army. They go partly by land and partly by w r ater. These 
regiments operate on our right or on the left bank of the St. Lawrence. 
General Carleton was so kind as to intrust me with a separate corps 
consisting of 300 Indians, 150 Canadians, the English battalion Make- 
line, the grenadier battalion Breymann and the regiments Riedesel 
and Hesse Hanau. I am to remain on the other side or to the rigrjt 
of the River St. Lawrence, advance as far as Sorel in order to attack 
it in case the rebels attempt to hold it, and then wait for further 
orders from General Carleton. He appears to have confidence in me, 
for he gives me at all times, either the command of the advance 
guard, or of a separate corps. I cannot deny that I am exceedingly 
flattered that this general desires to use me in preference to all ; and 
I am convinced that the Brunswick troops will have an opportunity 
to distinguish themselves, and that they will not suffer from want of 
provisions as there are not too many of them together. The pro 
visions, including the biscuits, we draw from the large transports, 
which follow us constantly. 

The dragoons and the regiment Prince Frederick have furnished 
to-day the first guard in the city. It numbers 120 men. The parade 
was good, and Carleton appeared highly pleased. These two regiments furnish also a guard of 300 men for the height opposite Quebec, 
in order to keep a lot of disloyal Canadians straight. The garrison 



TO GEN. 11IEDESEUS CAMPAIGN. 243 

lies in barracks in a pretty comfortable condition, and are furnished 
rations by the king. 

I have gone over all of the fortifications at Quebec. Were they 
in Germany, four to eight cannon would make such an opening in 
them in a few hours that half a battalion could march through it. It 
cannot be denied that Carleton has displayed great bravery. He had 
a great amount of work done in the middle of the winter, that the 
fortifications might be placed in a tolerably defensive condition, and 
he has rallied a garrison, consisting of citizens, Canadians and sailors, 
not having had a single regular soldier. But it must also be confessed, 
on the other hand, that the rebels must be a miserable lot of soldiers, 
since so few men, in such a condition, are able to oppose them. 

I witnessed to-day a great ceremony. Four deputations of Indians, 
in the name of their people, offered their services to the king of Eng 
land. The lower part of their bodies was naked, and was painted 
all over with red and green. They spoke in their own language, 
which was explained by an interpreter. General Carleton told them 
that two armies would march up the river on either bank. They 
could, therefore, decide for themselves whether they would go with 
him or with me. 

For the purpose of giving your highness an idea of the march we 
are about to enter upon, I take the liberty of stating the following : 

The men will march by land. Each regiment will receive four 
bateaux, on which the tents, officer s baggage, and rations for fifteen 
days are to be transported. They are to encamp close by the river 
on suitable hills, which, in case of necessity, will be entrenched by 
redoubts and ditches. All the baggage is to be carried on board the 
bateaux (which will be close at hand), before breaking up camp and 
marching further. The savages, Canadians and the light troops will 
form a chain around the camp. The large transports, on which the 
heavy baggage is to be left, will follow at a distance. 

At present, the horses will be of no use, on account of the army 
having to cross little rivers over which there are no bridges. I was 
obliged to leave all our horses behind at Quebec, where they will 
have a chance to rest ; nor shall I have them brought to me until I 
reach Lake Champlain. Thither I shall go, like the rest of the army, 
on foot ; and I hope I shall set a good example to my men. 

I can report nothing further in regard to our march. One dragoon has 
died at Quebec. Those who are dangerously ill are there in a hospital. 
I pray your gracious remembrance, etc., 

RlEDESEL. 1

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

Since my last report, nothing new on the part of the enemy has 
taken place. All the regiments yet remain in the same quarters as 
when I last wrote. 

Last week, on the 25th of July, the English Brigadier Gordon was 
shot in the right shoulder while in the woods near St. John, and now 
lies in a dangerous condition. I, myself, have passed over this same 
road more than thirty times. Through our patrols (consisting of 
Canadians, Indians and regulars), it was ascertained that the rebels 
had sent one captain and fifty men through the woods from Crown 
Point (which is forty leagues from here), to reconnoitre the cantonment of our troops. One of their officers with five men actually 
stole into the very centre of our encampment. It was these latter who 
shot Brigadier General Gordon. 

With an army in Germany it would be scarcely possible for an 
enemy to steal into a cantonment, but here, and with the way in 
which armies are posted, it ie easier. The only wonder is how the 
rebels could make this long march of forty leagues through deserts 
and dense woods, and carry, at the same time, rations for fifteen days 
on their backs. The effect, however, of their audacity will be to 
cause Brigadier Frazer, with the light infantry, to advance to Isle 
aux Noix. Meanwhile, 100 Indians and 200 Canadians have gone to 
Crown Point to strike a blow. 

I ascribe the large number of sick solely to the rations received on 
board the ships. These rations are still furnished at Quebec, but 
Carleton, in consequence of my oft repeated requests, has granted 
fresh meat ; and I, therefore, hope that the sick, especially among 
the dragoons who proportionately have the largest number ill, will 
now decrease in number. Those who have died at Quebec, were 
generally those who were too quickly cured of fever last fall ; and it 
may be for a similar reason, that those companies, who were at 
Wolfenbuttel, have the most sick, and those who were at Brunswick 
the fewest. 

All the deserters, with the exception of three, have been caught. 
Six were punished to-day and six are yet to be tried. A grenadier, 
who, on the march, wounded a noncommissioned officer, who urged 
him on while straggling, evidently with the intention of deserting, 
will very likely be sentenced to death by a court martial. Two 
Canadians, who aided two of our men to desert, I had whipped before 
the front this morning. This I did with the consent of General Carle- 
ton. It caused, however, quite an excitement among the inhabitants, 
who will be careful in future. All those who caught deserters received from me one guinea per capita. A few noncommissioned 
officers were punished by me, for negligence, by being chained and 
whipped ; and three young officers were placed under arrest for the 
same offense. 

I cannot but praise the zeal and activity of the commanders of 
regiments. 

The two regiments quartered here now drill and fire in whole 
battalions. They are, without praising ourselves, so well drilled that 
I wish I could show them to your highness, so confident, am I, that 
you would be satisfied with them. They are better than they were 
last fall. The grenadier battalion level their muskets, and get 
down on their knees better J than my own regiment, but the latter 
loads and marches better, and takes surer aim. I have suceeded in 
creating a certain jealousy between the two battalions. Breymann 
does not like to see my regiment get ahead of his, and I, on niy part, 
tell mine, which I drill myself, that the grenadiers drill better than 
they. 

We still know nothing different regarding the army of General 
Howe. The time for crossing Lake Champlain seems as yet quite in 
the future, and I can, therefore, report nothing reliable in relation to 
the time of our commencing our march. 

RlEDESEL. 2 

There is nothing new to report to your highness. The army is 
still in its old quarters, with this difference, that General Frazer, 
with his three battalions, the English grenadiers, the English light 
infantry and the 24th Regiment, is encamped on the Isle aux Noix, 
and further, that the post at St. John has again been garrisoned by 
the G2d Regiment, and 200 men of my brigade under Lieutenant 
Colonel You Specht. I was at St. John myself in order to place and 
instruct this command properly. I also visited Isle aux Noix at the 
same time. This is a good post, and may be considered the key to 
Canada from the New England side. There is still, on this island, a 
large entrenchment, built by the French during the last war, which 
is yet in good condition and of good service to Brigadier Frazer. 

Our ship building at St. John progresses slowly ; and, although 
General Burgoyne has assured me that everything will be ready in 
ten days, and that the army will be able to cross the lake by the 1st 
of September, I must confess that I doubt it, and believe, alas, with 
good reasons, that the commencement of the expedition will have to 
be postponed fourteen days longer.

246 OFFICIAL D CUMENTS EEL A TING 

General Carleton has not yet returned from Quebec, the reestablish-ment of all civil offices keeping him longer than he at first expected. 
Neither have we reliable intelligence from the fleet of my lord, nor 
from the army of General Howe. There is a rumor afloat at Montreal 
that my lord Howe had entered the Hudson in sight of New York, 
and that the army was disembarking behind that city and the fortified 
camp of the rebels. In such a case, it was said, that the latter would 
be surrounded. Should this news, which, however, needs confirma 
tion, be true, then the rebels would be in a sad fix, and nothing 
would be left for them but to attack Howe with a disadvantage, or 
to surrender finally for want of provisions. Neither Carleton nor 
Burgoyne have any news whatever from Howe. He has not even 
communicated to them his plan of operations. 

The condition of the troops as regards desertions, arrests, sick, etc., 
etc., your highness will see by the accompanying report. The sick 
are in about the same proportion, but it seems as if their number 
would now finally diminish, since the terrible heat has gone by. 
Some have died, but they were mostly those who had weak lungs. 
I am about done with drilling the men ; and, I must confess, without 
boasting, that the two battalions, which are here, are in a very good 
condition. I wait for Carleton s return to show them to him. 

RIEDESEL. 



Nothing of interest has occurred since my last report of July 29th, 
from Skeensborough, except that I was detached to Castletown with 
five battalions of the left wing from the 10th to the 25th, for the purpose 
of making the rebels believe that the army intended marching in that 
direction, and of giving the loyal inhabitants a chance to join the 
army. I have sent out a number of detachments, given orders for 
taking down and erecting magazines, and reconnoitered as far as my 
corps was to be the advance guard of the army. Opposite me, at a 
distance of about ten hours, stood a corps of 500 men, under Colonel 
Von Werner; and, although I have twice asked permission to scatter 
this corps, Burgoyne will not allow me to do it, pretending that he 
does not wish me to go so far away from the army. 

The passage of the artillery and its ammunition across Lake George 
having been arranged, Burgoyne, with the right wing, advanced 
from Skeensborough to Fort Anne with the intention of there awaiting my return from Castletown, and then attacking the rebel army 
near Fort Edward. But the latter did not wait for our arrival ; for 



1 Written about the 29th of August, 1776. 



TO GEN. RIEDESEVS CAMPAIGN. 247 

Monsieur Arnold, as soon as our advance guard showed itself, fell 
back five English miles. On the second day he went back as far as 
Saratoga. During this retreat, his rear guard lost upward of 30 
prisoners, and quite as many dead. The want of teams, in which to 
transport the baggage and ammunition, was the cause of our army 
being able only to advance in battalions. As I was the furthest 
behind, on account of my expedition to Castletown, I did not reach 
the army with the right wing until yesterday. 

Unless a total change is made in the system of the army, it will be 
impossible to execute with it rapid movements. So much difficulty 
is experienced by our having no teams, and being so far away from 
our bateaux, that the army is unable to advance three German miles 
without waiting again eight and ten days for our necessary supplies 
to be brought up. 

I have taken the liberty of proposing a plan to Burgoyne, viz : to 
send a detachment to the flatlands of the Connecticut river, and con 
fiscate all the horses in that vicinity. There are a great many in 
that region, and, in this w T ay, our 1,500 Canadian horses can be de 
voted entirely to drawing the artillery and trains, leaving the horses, 
thus procured, solely for the conveyance of the baggage. The army 
could then march whenever it pleased. He seemed to like the plan 
very much, and told me he intended to carry it out. He also said 
that he would then mount the regiment of dragoons. 

Yesterday we received the first reliable news from General Howe s 
army. It seems he advanced from New York up the Hudson ; and, 
it is supposed that a general engagement will take place between his 
forces and the main army under Washington, who is fortified on the 
highlands. A portion of Howe s army has been detached to the 
right toward the Connecticut river, and it is said to have advanced 
as far as Hartford. Another detachment, it is also stated, has been 
sent to Philadelphia, but it is not known as yet how far it has pro 
gressed. 

It appears to be the intention of General Washington to concen 
trate the entire strength of the rebels at one point, and there await its 
final fate. If, therefore, our armies move carefully, and" neither one 
nor the other are defeated, it is fair to presume that the whole rebel 
army will be surrounded before the end of September, and our army 
united to that of General Howe. 

As regards the condition of the regiments, their health is much 
better this year than the last. Still, those of Rhetz and Specht have 
quite a number sick. I have ordered all the heavy baggage, and 
whatever else the regiments have left behind in Canada, to be sent to 
Carillon (Ticonderoga). 



248 OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS RELATING 

Inasmuch as the company of chasseurs have done such extraordi 
nary good service at Hubardstown, and it is necessary that its prestige 
with the enemy should be maintained, I intend, with the approbation 
of your highness, to take from the other regiments those chasseurs, 
that are well drilled, and add them to it. Thus it will always be 
kept in fine condition for service. 

RlEDESEL. 1 



Fortune is often fickle, but especially so in war, a fact of which the 
following unpleasant event is a proof. Misfortune has fallen in an 
especial manner upon a portion of your troops, and that, too, after the 
glorious affair at Hubardstown. 

Your highness will remember seeing in my last report how difficult 
and laborious our marches have been on account of the want of 
horses and vehicles for the transportation of the provisions, artillery 
and regimental baggage. "When in camp at Skeensborough, I took 
the liberty of communicating my ideas on the subject to General 
Burgoyne. He accepted my memoir a copy of which I here in 
close as proof, and answered me that my suggestions accorded with 
his views, and he would, therefore, endeavor to carry them out as 
soon as possible. 

This memoir was written by me on the 22d of July, and was 
answered by him on the 27th. The troops were marching ; every 
thing was quiet ; and I heard nothing more of this project until the 
4th of August, when the whole army were together near Fort Ed 
ward. All at once, Burgoyne came in the afternoon into my tent, 
and handed me for my perusal, the instructions which had been 
made for Lieutenant Colonel Baum to join him in an expedition. 
He further stated that the latter was to carry out the instructions 
immediately, and that they had been given him in consequence of a 
plan which I had sent to himself (General Burgoyne). But how 
great was my astonishment at finding my plan so changed! My 
idea was to have Bauin march behind the army, by way of Castle- 
town and Clarendon, to the Connecticut river. Thus, the enemy s 
army would not have discovered the movement soon enough to send 
a hostile force against Baum. It would also have been within our 
power to get in the rear of his army with a corps of our own men. 
But instead of this, it was ordered in the instructions that Baum 
should cross the Battenkill opposite Saratoga, and march straight to 
Bennington, where a hostile force was defending a strong magazine.

TO GEN. EIEDESEUS CAMPAIGN. 249 

It was hoped that Baum would be able to beat the enemy at Ben- 
nington and capture this magazine, after which he was to march to 
Manchester and so carry out his instructions. 

This corps, also, was, contrary to my advice, formed much weaker 
than was advisable, and was likewise composed of so many different 
troops that it was not nearly as effective as I designed. Accordingly 
I did not fail to represent the danger to which Lieutenant Colonel 
Baum would be exposed, showing at the same time very plainly 
that he would be unable to attain his object. Nevertheless, General 
Burgoyne maintained his purpose, giving for it the following 
reasons : 

1st. By the capture of the magazine at Bennington our army would 
be provided with rations for at least from ten to fourteen days ; and 
thus we would be enabled to transfer a large magazine from Fort 
George to Saratoga, and continue the expedition. 

2d. As he was about to advance himself with the entire army to 
Saratoga, and General Fraser being already as near as could be to 
Stillwater, where General Arnold was, the enemy most certainly 
would not dare to send troops in large numbers to Bennington. But 
even if he should do so he (General Burgoyne) would be ready at 
any moment to attack a corps thus sent, in the rear. 

3d. Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger was then besieging Fort Stanwix 
on the Mohawk river. General Arnold desired to retain that fort, 
and would, therefore, detach a considerable force thither. In order 
to prevent him from doing this, we must engage the enemy s at 
tention. 

All my representations were, therefore, in vain. General Fraser 
and Lieutenant Colonel Baum started on the 9th of August. The 
latter was to receive his several detachments from the former. He 
was instructed in everything according to the wishes of Burgoyne ; 
and Captain O Connell, also an engineer officer, was sent with him 
as an interpreter. Colonel and Governor Skeene also accompanied 
him to assist in the dispatches and the different supplies. 

When Lieutenant Colonel Baum arrived at Fort Miller, where he 
was to receive, on the following day, the necessary troops from 
Fraser, everything was wanted. Neither the savages, nor the Canadians could be rallied most"bf them having advanced against the 
rebels near Stillwater. Baum was thus forced to remain at Fort 
Miller on the 10th, and I received orders, against my judgment, to 
furnish another 100 men of Breymann s corps as a reenforcernent to 
Baum. 

On the llth, the latter advanced to the Battenkill opposite Saratoga, 
and arrived on the 12th at Cambridge. His advance guard en- 
32 



250 OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS RELATING 

countered a detachment of rebels which was repulsed. Eight men 
were taken prisoners, and a magazine, containing 100 bushels of 
corn, a large quantity of flour, 1,500 oxen, and a great many other 
things were captured. It was here that Baum was informed that the 
enemy at Bennington numbered from 15,000 to 18,000 men, but that 
they were mostly militia men who had little idea of fighting, and 
who, at his advance, would certainly fall back. He also learned that 
the stores at Bennington were considerable, containing upward of 
2,000 oxen and 300 horses. 

Animated by the result of his first encounter, and being a man of 
determined will, Baum made up his mind to march on Bennington 
on the 13th, and dislodge the enemy at that place. He sent a report 
of all that had happened up to that time to Burgoyne, who not only 
was well pleased with his whole conduct, but consented to the attack 
on Bennington, with, however, this remark, that he (Baum) should 
not advance until he was well informed of the enemy s position and 
was sure of attacking it advantageously. 

Lieutenant Colonel Baum halted on tne 13th, four miles this side 
of Bennington. On the morning of the 14th, just as he was in the 
act of starting, he was attacked by about 700 men, who, however, 
fell back upon the firing of a few cannon. Baum, at this point, 
received intelligence from some royalists and a prisoner, that the 
enemy was well fortified at Benniugton, and that he expected reen- 
forcements when he would there make an attack. Accordingly, 
Baum very judiciously changed his plan ; remained where he was, 
and asked for reenforcements. But the tone of his request was such 
as made Burgoyne believe that he did not wish to risk anything, and 
only asked for reenforcements that he might attack Bennington. 

This was the time when Baum should have fallen back ; because 
the distance between him and Breymann (some thirty miles) was too 
great for the latter to come to his assistance in season, in case 
of attack. But this was not thought of, and Breymann received 
orders on the morning of the 15th, to go to the assistance of Baum, 
who was informed of his coming. 

The reason why Baum was not recalled was, that he was bent 
upon taking Bennington. I will not recapitulate the details of this 
expedition, but inclose herewith his f eport. By this, as well as by 
other circumstances, it is plain that the distance between him and 
Breymann was too great for the latter to arrive in time. All, who 
were present, testify that Baum and the troops did well. He had 
thoroughly beaten the enemy when he was forced, through want 
of ammunition, to retreat. This the enemy observing, again 
advanced. 



TO GEN, RIEDESEUS CAMPAIGN. 251 

In regard to the commencement of this affair, its progress and its 
termination no one yet can state anything definite. The statements 
of those who have escaped are so at variance that no certain conclusion can be at present reached. But this much is certain ; that Baum, 
after being informed that Breymann was coming to his assistance, 
would not leave his post. Several small bands of armed men were 
near his camp in the morning, but he was told that they were royal 
ists. Between nine and ten o clock, these bands growing stronger 
and stronger, he began to investigate, and found that he was entirely 
surrounded by the enemy. These were the 1,800 men from Benning- 
ton, who, the previous day, had been reenforced by 2,000 men from 
Arnold s army a fact of which no one knew anything. 

Upon a prearranged signal, he was attacked at about half-past ten 
o clock from all sides. He held out for two hours, repulsing the 
enemy twice, until having expended all his ammunition he was on 
the point of retreating with his dragoon regiment, being entirely cut 
off from the savages and Canadians. Twice he cut his way through 
the enemy. None of the dragoons having another shot, he ordered 
them to sling their guns over their shoulders and draw their swords. 
In this way he endeavored to cut his way through the third time. 
What has been the fate of the poor men God only knows. Of the 
dragoons, who left here one hundred and fifty men strong, only 
seven have returned. I have now about eighty men of this regiment 
with me, consisting of a camp guard, a few sick and some who remained behind. 

General Burgoyne has publicly praised the men, but notwithstanding this, I cannot divest myself of the sorrow which I feel at this 
event, especially since the expedition was planned contrary to my 
wishes. I, myself, offered to go with Breymann s corps, but Bur 
goyne refused me on the ground that there was no other general 
with the army but he and I. Aside from the great loss of so many 
brave men of your highness, and the boast of the rebels, this affair 
will not be of much consequence, for Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger 
has captured Fort Stanwix with many cannon and a strong garrison. 
It is also said that General Clinton has won a battle near the high 
lands. 

The army of Arnold has evacuated Stillwater, and, it is rumored, 
is in Albany. As soon as our provisions and the necessary bateaux, 
which are transported by laud, shall have reached us, the army will 
advance, and will soon be in Albany in spite of our losses. 

I would recommend to your favor Lieutenant Colonel Breymann 
and Major Von Barner. They have acted bravely. This corps, 
witli the exception of its losses, is in the best condition. I must not 



252 OFFICIAL D CUMENTS EEL A TING 

suffer many more such losses, otherwise I would rather sacrifice my 
life in the service of your highness, than to spend it in nothing but 
sorrow and misfortune. 

Your most obedient and humble servant, 

RlEDESEL. 1

MEMOIR OF GENERAL RlEDESEL TO GENERAL BURGOYNE. 

SKEENSBOROUGH, July 22, 1777. 

Sir : Your excellency will remember that in the spring, on your 
arrival at Three Rivers, you gave me permission always to express 
my opinion to you freety, whenever an opportunity for doing good 
to the regiments offered itself. The position in which the army is 
at present induces me to take this freedom, with the firm confidence 
that the kindness of heart, and the friendship of your excellency will 
pardon it. 

Great and rapid successes have at once placed the army in such a 
position that we will often be forced to be, either with the whole or 
part of the army, far away from the rivers and our bateaux. The 
equipment of the army is of such a nature that our bateaux are very 
necessary, if we would not find ourselves short of everything. This 
makes trouble. One-half of a regiment runs around to procure the 
necessaries for the soldier. The men are weary from toil, and the 
battalion grows so weak that they look more like slim companies 
than heavy masses of men. The movements of the army can only 
be carried out slowly and by piece-meal, lacking, as it does, the 
means to transport that which is most necessary. 

I, therefore, give it as my opinion that there are only two ways for 
us to do. We must with the army always remain near a river, and 
not leave it until means offer themselves for transporting the bateaux 
to another river the time for their transportation not being more 
than eight days. This proceeding, however, in my opinion, is at 
tended with the following disadvantages : 

1st. The army are able to move but very slowly ; and the ad 
vantages which offer themselves upon the sudden retreat of the 
enemy cannot be availed of in time. Consequently the consternation 
which might perhaps be produced among the rebels by the presence 
of the royal army would not be increased. 

2d. The inhabitants of the country, who are at present extremely 
frightened, will voluntarily submit, and the army in a short time be 
provided with everything, provided we now and then appear with 
detachments. The latter, however, must not be allowed to go too 
great a distance from the main body. The enemy has small parties 
everywhere, and these keep the people in subjection. Therefore, 
confiscate all the teams, and make a desert of the whole country. 
Thus your excellency will be able to gain a much wider field for the 
operations of your army than at present. 

3d. The country, which our army has just left, has taken fresh 
courage ; a new militia has been organized ; small detachments once 
more .roam through these districts ; and each partisan can operate 
against our communications. This latter circumstance may in future 
be even more detrimental to us than at present. 

To avoid all these evils, our army must be brought into a condition 
in which it can move with much more celerity than it has been 
accustomed to. That is, the requisite number of horses must be 
procured to carry the necessary baggage of the officers, the tents, 
ammunition, artillery and provisions. It is, in my opinion, very 
disadvantageous to transport the baggage and tents on Canadian 
carts. They spoil the good roads, and can get along only with the 
utmost difficulty on good roads. The column is, therefore, lengthened 
too much, and the men are very often without tents, the carts not 
being able to keep up. But a pack horse goes everywhere. It can 
walk on the flanks of the regiment, and thus always provide the 
army with necessaries. Pack horses, therefore, would in my humble 
opinion, do away entirely with the carts. I would, also, keep no 
more teams than were absolutely necessary for the transportation of 
the provisions and artillery. 

When the regiments have a sufficient number of pack horses col 
lected, and when the transportation of the artillery is safely provided 
for, then your excellency can send out detachments at pleasure; 
keep a check upon the main body of the enemy ; and thus keep the 
inhabitants in subjection yea, even break up their militia, and pro 
cure the necessary support for the army ^ You can, also, extend or 
contract the army as you see fit, and thus freely operate indepen 
dently of the bateaux and a thousand other contingencies. 

I believe that the army may easily be placed in this independent 
position in three or four weeks at the furthest. 

The country between here and the Connecticut and even fifteen 
miles beyond that river is destitute of troops and full of the best 
horses. In fact, there is not an inhabitant who does not possess 
three or four horses. 

If your excellency will detach to the Connecticut, the regiment of 
dragoons, the corps of Peters and of Yessop, and an officer and thirty 
of each regiment, under the command of a good staff officer, I am 
convinced that this corps would procure the necessary number of 
horses for the army. The regiment of dragoons would thus be 
mounted, and do all that your excellency would expect from it. 

Your excellency might determine upon a proportionate tax of 
about five to six guineas for each horse. A commissary might go 
with this corps and give a receipt for each horse to the owner, who, 
upon producing it, could be paid by the general cashier. The officers 
who received horses might then have the money for them, gradually 
deducted from their pay, while the horses for the dragoons would be 
paid for by the king. This detachment, also, could, at the same 
time, gather up all the ox teams to be used in transporting the pro 
visions. This plan, if carried out, would place the army in the most 
flourishing condition, and your excellency would no longer have 
any difficulty in carrying out each movement, either in detail or 
otherwise according to your own plan. 

Your excellency might, perhaps, think it mean to take all the 
horses from the inhabitants, but it must be considered : 1st. That the 
chief work here is done by oxen, and that horses are only made use 
of either for carrying grain to the mill, or for riding. 2d. The horses 
could be bought at a price much above their value. 3d. If there was 
a want of horses, they would not be able to convey the news to the 
enemy so rapidly or so often. 4th. This little blood letting would, 
at least, be a just punishment for their treason and bad conduct 
toward their king. I am convinced that this course can be justified 
before God, the king and parliament, it being to the material advantage of the army and his majesty. 1 

Having thus communicated my ideas candidly and confidentially 
to the friendship of your excellency, I rely on your forbearance and 
pardon for my freedom. 

I have the honor, etc., 

RlEDESEL.

ACCOUNT OF THE AFFAIR NEAR WALLORM-KORK, AUGUST 16, 1777, 
BY LIEUTENANT COLONEL BREYMANN. 

At eight o clock on the morning of the 15th of August, I received 
orders from his excellency, General Burgoyne, by his adjutant Captain Clark, to start at once with the corps, consisting of the company 
of yagers, a battalion of chasseurs and grenadiers and two cannon, 
and reenforce the corps of Lieutenant Colonel Baum. I started, 
therefore, at 9 o clock ; and there not being any teams, I had two 
ammunition boxes placed upon the artillery wagons. Each soldier 
carried with him forty cartridges. The crossing of the Battenkill 
consumed considerable time, for the men had all to wade through 



TO GEN. RIEDESEISS CAMPAIGN. 257 

the water. The great number of hills, the bottomless roads, and a 
severe and continuous rain, made the march so tedious that I could 
scarcely make one-half of an English mile an hour. The cannons 
and the ammunition wagons had to be drawn up hill one after the 
other. All this, of course, impeded our march very much ; and I 
was unable to hasten it notwithstanding all of my endeavors. The 
carts loaded with ammunition upset, and it caused considerable 
trouble to right them. 

To this, also, was added another difficulty. The guide, whom we 
had, lost the way and could not find it again. At last, Major Earner 
found a man who put us back on the right path. 

All these unexpected mishaps prevented me from marching on the 
enemy on the loth, as far as Cambridge, and, I, therefore, found myself 
obliged to encamp seven miles this side of that place. 

Before reaching that place, however, I wrote to Lieutenant Colonel 
Baum notifying him of my arrival, and sent Lieutenant Hagcmann 
with the dispatch. Lieutenant Colonel Baum received this note at 
eleven o clock at night ; and I received his answer on the following 
morning. 

Early on the morning of the 16th, I set out, but the artillery horses 
being very weak, in consequence of their not having been fed, the 
march progressed very slowly. 

Major Earner was obliged to go ahead with the advance guard in 
order to procure horses and carts. These reached us before noon, 
and we at once made use of them. The march was then continued 
with as much haste as possible beyond Cambridge, where I was 
forced to halt half an hour to collect the columns. 

Toward two in the afternoon, Colonel Skeene sent two men to me 
with the request that I would detach one officer and twenty men to 
occupy the mill at St. Coyk, as the rebels showed signs of advancing 
on it. Instead of sending these men as he desired, I dispatched 
Captain Gleisenberg ahead with the advance guard, consisting of 
sixty grenadiers and chasseurs and twenty yagers. I followed as 
quickly as possible with the rest. Some of the ammunition carts 
again broke down on the road. 

I reached the mill at St. Coyk at half-past four o clock in the after 
noon, and found the advance guard, which had been sent on ahead, 
in that place undisturbed. I candidly confess, that I did not hear a 
cannon or a musket shot either w r hile on the march or in the mill. 

Colonel Skeene was also at the mill. He informed me that the 
corps of Colonel Baum ^ as only two miles distant. I supposed, 
therefore, that I could not do better than to hasten to meet it. Colonel Skeene was of the same opinion, and we both marched over the 
33 



258 OFFICIAL D CUMENTS EEL A TING 

bridge in order to reach the camp of Baum, being as yet unaware 
that his fate was already sealed. If Colonel Skeene was acquainted 
with that fact at this time, then I cannot imagine what could have 
induced him to keep it from me; for, in such a case, I certainly 
would not have risked an engagement. 

I was scarcely 000 paces from the bridge when I noticed through 
the woods a considerable number of armed men (some of whom wore 
blouses and some jackets), hastening toward an eminence on my left 
flank. I called Colonel Skeene s attention to it, and received from 
him the reply, that these men were royalists. But upon his riding 
up toward them and calling to them, the matter was soon explained, 
for instead of returning an answer, they fired upon us. I, thereupon 
ordered the battalion Earner to move toward the height, while the 
yagers and grenadiers advanced on the right. The engagement now 
commenced, and lasted until nearly eight o clock. 

The cannon were posted on a road where there was a log house. 
This w T e fired upon as it was occupied by the rebels. This drove 
them out, and we then repulsed them on all sides, and this too, not 
withstanding they received reenforcements. 

The troops did their duty, and I know of no one who doubts this 
fact After our ammunition was all expended, and the artillery in 
consequence ceased firing, nothing was more natural than to suppose 
that the enemy would be encouraged to renew his attack. Under 
this supposition I hastened, with a number of men, to the cannon in 
order to take them away. By this movement most of my men were 
severely w T ounded. The horses either were dead or in a condition 
which prevented them moving from the spot. In order, therefore, 
not to risk anything (as I was unable to return the enemy s fire, my 
ammunition being exhausted), I retreated on the approach of darkness, destroyed the bridge, had as many of the wounded as possible 
brought thither that they might not be captured, and, after a lapse 
of half an hour in company with Colonel Skeene, pursued my march 
and reached Cambridge toward twelve o clock at night. Here, after 
taking precautionary measures, I remained during that night, and 
marched thence at daybreak of the 17th of August to the camp. 

This is all that I am able to report concerning the affair of the 16th 
of August. The loss of the two cannon pains me most. I did my 
best to save them, but the above named circumstances and the want 
of ammunition rendered it impossible to retake them from under the 
fire of the enemy s muskets, although I would willingly have done it 
even at the loss of my life. 

Your most obedient, 

In camp at Saratoga, August 20, 1777. BREYMANN.

LETTER OP BURGOYNE S ADJUTANT TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL BREYMANN. 

Right Honorable Sir, highly respected Lieutenant Colonel : General Burgoyne has himself written a letter to yon this forenoon, and 
he has directed me just now to address you a few lines to say that in 
consequence of the good news, he has this moment received, from 
Lieutenant Colonel Baum, he would be very glad providing there 
be not too much risk if his design in regard to the expedition could 
be carried out. He, however, leaves it to yourself and your talents 
to do that which you consider best. 

The general requests that as soon as circumstances will safely 
permit it, you will send to the army the horses, cattle, etc., which 
you can spare, and which have been captured from the enemy. 
I have the honor to be with high esteem, 
Sir, your obedient servant,

LETTER OF JUSTIFICATION OF GENERAL RIEDESEL IN REGARD TO 
THE ENGAGEMENT NEAR BENNINGTON, ON THE 16TH OF AUGUST, 
1777, TO DUKE CHARLES WILLIAM FERDINAND OF BRUNSWICK. 

NEW YORK ISLAND, September 3, 1780. 

Captain Cleve, upon his return from Germany to New York, 
informed me that there is still a doubt in the public mind as to 
whether I was not the author of the affair near Bennington. This, 
also, seems the more reasonable, since General Burgoyne, in his last 
letter of justification, published under the title of The State of t/te 
Expedition, seeks to persuade the world that I not only proposed the 
plan of the expedition but even drew up the order for its execution 
for Lieutenant Colonel Baum. I consider myself, therefore, in duty 
bound to throw still more light upon this subject, and endeavor to 
explain it a second time. This step on my part, moreover, seems to 
me the more necessary, sftice many persons try to make out that this 
unsuccessful expedition was the source of all the misfortunes which 
have befallen the northern army, and consider all the mishaps near 
Saratoga as the natural consequence of it. If this is true, then am I 
more guilty than HE who commanded the northern army up to the 
time of the convention, or HE who first planned the campaign of 1777. 

The inclosed document marked A, was my plan. I was induced 
to make it on account of the sad situation in which I found myself 
placed while in my camp at Castletown, where tents, provisions and 
other necessaries had to be carried on the backs of the soldiers from 
a distance of nine miles, and where the entire region round about 
abounded with horses, which were used by the inhabitants, for no 
other purpose than to come in the morning to take the oath of 
allegiance to the king, and return again in the evening to the com 
manding officers of the enemy and relate everything they had seen 
in my camp. 

No person, in reading this document, can discover the idea ad 
vanced, that this corps were to engage the enemy. On the contrary, 
it is asserted that the direction of the march was at such a distance 
from Albany, that the whole thing could have been carried out and 
the blow struck before the enemy could have even begun to suspect 
anything in regard to this excursion. 

There is an interval between the date of this document and the 
time of the giving of the order to Lieutenant Colonel Baum, during 
which the condition of the army had materially changed. The 
question, therefore, arises, was the time when the order was given 
as favorable as it was when the plan was made ? 

General Burgoyne, himself, in his State of the Expedition, proves 
exactly the contrary. He states that the American tfroops, who at 
tacked Lieutenant Colonel Baum near Bennington, were those who 
came from Massachusetts bay to reenforce the hostile army at Albany. 
But the country was, by that time, already in arms, and the plan 
rendered more difficult to be carried out than when I proposed the 
plan. 

Since General Burgoyne passes over in silence those transactions 
which took place between him and me in regard to the expedition 
during this interval, I am forced to relate them in this place. As 
they were only oral I can but give my word of honor for their truth 
fulness. 

On the 31st of July, I went from Fort Anne to Fort Edward for 
the purpose of seeing General Burgoyne. As soon as he perceived 
me, he took me one side, thanked me for the memoir, which I had 
sent him from Skeensborough, and excused himself for not having 
answered it, giving as an excuse that the time for its execution had 
not yet arrived. 

I modestly answered, that matters had somewhat changed, but 
that I thought if Lieutenant Colonel Baum would go in the same 
direction as was laid down in the plan, and if another corps would 
endeavor to drive Colonel Warner from Manchester, and thus cause a 
diversion in that direction, it would still not be impossible to have 
the undertaking carried out with success. 

His answer to this was as follows : " I do not think it necessary to 
send Lieutenant Colonel Baum so far back. Warner, according to news 
I have received, has fallen back from Manchester to Bennington ; and, 
if Baum takes such a circuitous rout, he cannot return in season, and 
I cannot postpone my intended advance until his arrival." 

I, thereupon, took the liberty to remark that it ought to be decided 
whether Baum should take horses, oxen, etc., or should fight the 
enemy ; that the enemy would certainly send a detachment against 
him from Albany, and thus the plan might be frustrated ; but that if 
Baum should offer battle to the enemy, or assume the offensive 
against Warner, I would have nothing to say against it. 1 

Upon this, General Burgoyne, with a flattering mien tapped me 
upon my epaulette, and said : " My friend, I intend to kill two flies 
with one blow. I am informed that Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger is 
before Fort Stanwix and is besieging it. Since it is impossible for 
me to advance, on account of want of provisions, I design Lieutenant 
Colonel Baum s march to attract the attention of the enemy to his 
right wing, and thus prevent him from sending succor to Fort 
Stanwix." 

This answer from my commanding general, as a matter of course, 
prevented me from replying, and thus the conversation ended. 

On the 2d of August, I went into camp at Fort Edward with the 
left wing. Upon reporting myself to General Burgoyne, he laid 
before me orally his ideas of the manner in which Baum should carry 
out his expedition, at the same time requesting me to draw up an 
order and lay it before him for revision. This document is here 
inclosed, marked B. 2 In speaking of this order in the lower house, 
Major Kingston said it contains the sentiments of General Riedesel. 
General Burgoyne also quotes it in his treatise on half of a page, with 
his remarks opposite, under the title of Ms amendments. 



1 This? is the reading of this sentence in the German text. In another draft, how 
ever, of this same letter written by Riedesel in French and signed by him, which I 
procured in Germany and which is now before me, the reading which is slightly 
different, is as follows : " Thereupon, I took the liberty to reply as follows : that 
it ought to be determined whether Baum should make an excursion in the vicinity 
for the purpose of taking from the inhabitants their horses, oxen and teams, or 
whether he should givtj battle to the enemy ; that, in the first "case (which was 
always my idea), I believe the march to Manchester would be too far ; that the 
enemy would, without doubt, detach from Albany a corps against him, and thus 
defeat his design ; but that if Baum assumed the offensive against Warner, that I 
would say nothing against it." Translator-. 

2 Max Van Eelking in a note in the original, states that " this document cannot 
be found." I am, however, the guilty cause of his not finding it, as I myself found 



252 OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS RELATING 

I cannot deny that I was the one who wrote this order, in the same 
way, for instance, as an adjutant writes the order of his general; but 



it when in Germany, and, with the permission of its owner, carried it with me to 
America. It is now before me, and reads as follows : 

"B. 

" Statement of Instructions given to Lieutenant Colonel Baumfor his Guidance in the 
Expedition that he is to command, 

" The design of this expedition is to sound the sentiments of the inhabitants, to 
mount the regiment of dragoons, and to furnish the army with horses, oxen and 
teams. Colonel Baum is to take the route to Arlington, Manchester and Eocking- 
ham, making a halt at each of those places, and from Manchester he is to send 
detachments of savages and provincials to the head of the Connecticut river, even 
as far as No. Four. 

" From Manchester, he will continue his route as far as Eockingham, where he 
will post himself. 

li The lieutenant colonel, with his regular troops, is not to pass beyond Eocking 
ham. He is to take up in that place the most advantageous position. All the 
oxen, horses and teams are to be sent to the army by the provincials well escorted. 
After the design of the expedition has been accomplished, he will take the most 
direct road, by way of Brattlebury, to Albany, to join the main body of the army at 
that place. 

" At every place through which he passes, he is to make the inhabitants believe 
that the corps, which he commands, is the advance guard of the army which is on 
its way to Boston, and which is to be joined at Springfield by a body of troops

" In case that the main army has not arrived in Albany by the time that the lieu 
tenant colonel has accomplished his object, General Burgoyne will give him advice, 
and recall him to the army when he will give him and his corps another route. 

" The lieutenant colonel will give from time to time intelligence of his position, 
and what he has accomplished. 

"In case of the enemy combining against Lieutanant Colonel Baum in too great 
force, General Burgoyne will not fail to send him the most prompt succor, and will 
make such a movement that the enemy will find himself between two fires. 

" VOILA, in general the nature of the instructions given to Lieutenant Colonel 
Baum. The change afterward made in his route, was caused by the report of 
Colonel Skeene who gave Burgoyne information to the effect that the enemy had a 
very large magazine of supplies at Bennington, and that it would be a very easy 
matter to surprise and capture it. 

" Lieutenant Colonel Baum was sent from his camp at the Battenkill on the right 
toward Bennington. 

" The rebels having sent large reenforcements to that place, the lieutenant 
colonel was not able (with his small number), to resist the efforts of an enemy who 
had, at least, ten times his force. The misfortunes which resulted are only too 
well known.

that they were not my own sentiments is proved by the memoir 
which I have already alluded to. 1 

I handed the order, drawn up in this manner, to General Burgoyne. 
He put it in his pocket and said he would read it and then talk to me 
more about it. On the next day, he came to my tent and brought 
me the sketch again with the added alterations, which are the same 
that he calls his amendment in his Treaties? This order was corrected 
in accordance with his amendments, and General Burgoyne received 
an English translation thereof, while Lieutenant Colonel Baum received the original ; and this is all I had to do with the whole matter. 

There were a great many difficulties connected with the carrying 
out of the expedition ; it w r as not easy to procure the requisite quota 
from the corps of Brigadier Frazer; the Indians could not be induced 
to march ; and horses were needed for the transportation of the 
necessary articles. Thus a few more days passed away. 

Meanwhile, General Burgoyne heard of the magazine at Benning- 
ton. Thereupon he rode himself into the camp of Lieutenant Colonel 
Baum, and gave him the oral order not to march to Manchester, but 
direct to Bennington. With this order Baum marched at once with 
out my seeing him again. Then came the misfortune which is 
known to the world. 

Upon Lieutenant Colonel Baum making his report to the effect 
that he was opposite the Battenkill and waited for further orders, 
General Burgoyne sent his adjutant, Clarke, to me in the night, and 
requested me to order Lieutenant Colonel Breymann to march at 
once to the relief of Colonel Baum. I replied, that I considered the 
situation of the latter as very dangerous, and that I thought it much 
more advisable to order him back again halfway to meet Breymann, 
when he could act as circumstances might dictate. In truth, I did 
not like to have anything to do with the matter, and, therefore, sent 
Captain Gerlach to General Burgoyne in order that the necessary 
orders might be carried directly from that general to Breymann.

This is all that I had to do with this Bennington expedition ; and 
I now leave it to any military man if I can with truth be called the 
author of this expedition. 1 



1 In the French draft of this letter, the last paragraphs are much more in detail ; 
and I am inclined to believe the most trustworthy, from the fact that my copy (the 
French draft), is signed by Riedesel himself, whereas the one in the text has no 
signature. Beginning at the paragraph which commences with the sentence, 
11 meanwhile. General Burgoyne heard of the magazine at Bennington," etc., the 
French draft reads as follows : 

" Meanwhile, General Burgoyne was told by a certain provincial captain, named 
Sherwood, that the enemy had established a considerable magazine at Beuuiugton 
which was very poorly (lightly, legerement) guarded. Seduced by this news, which 
Captain Sherwood said had been intimated to him by Colonel Skeene, General 
Burgoyne rode on horseback into the camp of Lieutenant Colonel Baum, and gave 
him verbally the order not to go to Manchester, but to march directly for Benning 
ton. With this order, Lieutenant Colonel Baum set out on his march, without my 
ever seeing him after. 

" The misfortunes which happened to him and his corps are only too well known 
by my exact and faithful reports from John s farm. 

" Lieutenant Colonel Baum anticipating very soon a serious resistance from the 
enemy did not fail to make a regular report of this to General Burgoyne. He told 
him that 2,000 of the enemy were assembled at Bennington. and he prayed him to 
reenforce him, that he might be able either to sustain his position, or attack the 
enemy at Bennington according to circumstances. On receiving this report, 
General Burgoyne sent his aid de camp, Sir Francis Clarke, to me in the night and 
requested me to order Lieutenant Colonel Breymann immediately to reenforce 
Lieutenant Colonel Baum, and having united with him, be prepared either to 
sustain an attack from, or attack the enemy. Mv reply to Sir Francis Clarke was, 
that I considered the situation of Lieutenant Colonel Baum very precarious, and 
that my advice would be to order Lieutenant Colonel Baum to retire half way back 
and join the corps of Lieutenant Colonel Breymann, and, afterwards, to act together according to circumstances, that, for this reason, I would prefer that 
General Burgoyne should dispense with me entirely in this affair ; and that I 
would send Captain Gerlach to General Burgoyne that he might send by him such 
orders to Lieutenant Colonel Breymann as he might deem the most fitting. 

" This, my lord, is the true statement of all the agency I had in this expedition 
to Benniugton ; and I leave myself entirely to the judgment of military comnois- 
eeurs, to determine whether they believe me to be the author of the expedition to 
Bennington. 

li I am, with the greatest devotion to your most serene highness,

CHARLES WILLIAM FERDINAND 1 TO GENERAL RIEDESEL. 

BRUNSWICK, January 5, 1781. 
Highly Honored Major General : 

The explanations which your honor has given me respecting Ben- 
nington and Saratoga, although very valuable to me, were not 
necessary for your justification. The people have done you ample 
justice; and I, for my part, have not expected anything else as I am 
pretty well acquainted with the actors in those events. 

Since the loss of my father, all my efforts have been bent upon the 
reconstruction of this country : and I flatter myself not entirely 
without success. I hope to be able in a shori time to resign the com 
mand of the Prussian regiment which was intrusted to me, that I 
may devote myself solely to my new duties, which, of course, removes 
me entirely from military matters. Your honor will find me to be a 
real country gentleman, living only for his farm and the education 
of his children, and shunning everything that does not come within 
this province. It is really no small good fortune to be able to escape 
from this stormy world. I feel this, and know, therefore, how to 
appreciate my good luck. May Heaven give you perfect health, and 
bring you back to us when peace is finally made. Friendship and 
esteem will meet you here. 

Filled with such sentiments, I have the honor of being always, 
Your honor s 

Most faithful friend and servant.

GENERAL RIEDESEL TO THE HEREDITARY PRINCE. 

CAMBRIDGE, September 12, 1778. 

Most Illustrious Hereditary Prince : 

The war between the emperor and his majesty the king, having 
begun (according to the newspapers which are our only sources of 
news from Europe), and as your highness commands one of the 
strongest corps in the Prussian army, I congratulate you, thereupon most humbly, knowing that the wishes of your highness are now 
fulfilled. 1 

Your highness has now an opportunity of once more showing your 
great talents, and of rendering many services to a monarch, who, by 
his publicly expressed regards for you, has reechoed the sentiments of 
the public. 2 

How delighted would I be if I could engage in this war under your 
highness. I would gladly be your very last adjutant. What a 
difference between a war there, and here, where unfavorable territory, 
want of everything, and ignorance on the part of the leaders frustrate 
all expeditions, and will not consider the character of the people 
against whom we are fighting. All that you have predicted in regard 
to it is true, and has, alas, taken place ; and I now see clearly that 
the conquering of this nation by force of arms is and will be a 
problem which cannot be solved, unless divisions among the colonies, 
quarrels with the French (against whom they cherish a great hatred), 
want of resources, and the policy of the English commissioners, 
solves it. 

I will not trouble you, who are now engaged in such important 
business, with complaints in regard to our still being unexchanged, 
with a narration of the hostile operations here, nor with an account of 
the bad situation in which the troops of your highness find them 
selves at present. lam convinced that his serene highness, the duke, 
will communicate to you my reports to him, in which I give every 
thing in detail. I only desire to commend myself and the whole 
corps the conduct of whom both in good and bad fortune has been 
extremely good to the gracious consideration of your highness, 
and to pray for your gracious protection in case w r e should need it. 

The public testimonial which General Burgoyne has given in his 
speech before parliament, and his public declaration that no blame 
attaches to the troops for the failure of his expedition, is, I hope, an 
honor to the troops. If the period which is to decide our fate was 
only at hand now, and if these troops only had an opportunity for 
avenging the calamity they have endured, I should rest content. 

I am, etc.,

A FEW LETTERS AND ORDERS OF GENERAL BURGOYNE TO GENERAL RIEDESEL, WHILE ON THE MARCH TO SARATOGA. ON THE BOUQUET RIVER, June 24, 1777. 

My Dear General : 

It is my intention to have the army march from here to Crown 
point in making a movement, which will allow a rest of two or three 
hours on the march. 

You will, therefore, have the goodness to see that the troops take 
down the tents (if the weather will permit it), and endeavor to reach 
Crow r n point before two o clock to-morrow. But in case there 
should be too much wind for the enemy to cross at the proper 
moment, you will remain until a more favorable opportunity, taking 
care, however, not to arrive in the night. 

I have the honor with respect, and esteem, to sign myself, 

Your most faithful and obedient servant,

I beg you to order the reserve corps of the left wing to remain in 
the woods during the day ; but on the approach of night, to occupy 
the house in front of them on the clearing near the river with a captain and a proportionate detachment. The yagers will advance, and 
the post of the captain will serve as a support, while the troops of 
Lieutenant Colonel Breymann will be on the left wing of its position. 
The reserve corps will be supported by the fire from the ships in 
case of an attack. You will, also, please embark the left wing, in 
order to support it in case the engagement proves a severe one. 

I have the honor, etc.,

July 4, 1777. 

My Dear Sir : 

I have this moment received the letter, with which you have 
honored me, and also the report of Lieutenant Colonel Breymann. 

The strong picket, at the foot of the mountain, is evidence that 
the post of Breymann causes some uneasiness to the enemy. I do 
not believe that the latter will think of continuing his cannon fire, 
either from one side or the other, after seeing the result. 

Our men work diligently on the roads designed as a communication for the right wing. I am very sure that the same work pro 
gresses under your command, on the left wing, with the greatest 
possible expedition. 

The savages, who should have passed before daybreak, did not 
march by till about seven o clock. Captain Frazer very likely marched 
by without halting, in order to reach the rendezvous which was 
designated for eight o clock at a distance of two miles beyond. This 
appears probable. He ought, however, to have united himself to us. 

I do not know whether I shall be able to visit the left wing to-day 
or not. 

I have, etc.,

SKEENESBOHOUGII, July 7, 1777. 

I arrived here yesterday in season to attack the manned ships of 
the enemy which cover his retreat. He had only rive, two of which 
were taken, and the rest burned and blown up. A great part of their 
baggage and ammunition is in our possession. His army is cut in 
two. The New England provincials have left for home in the 
greatest disorder. The others have turned toward Fort George, 
where they intend to await General Putnam with an army of 5,000 
men. It is my opinion that the army of Ticonderoga is entirely 
annihilated, as it is in want of all the materials for support and defense. 

You will have the kindness to go into a " camp of rest " with the 
troops of the left wing, either on Mount Independence or in its 
vicinity, and there remain until I have completed my arrangements 
for the continuation of our advance. If you find means for forwarding our provisions, I wish Breymann s corps l^be stationed within 
a few miles of barrack Independence, on the main road to Ticon 
deroga near No. 4, to support operations in that direction, and facili 
tate communication des Men effectives. 

You will have the goodness to distribute manifestoes and issue 
strict orders for the prevention of plundering or otherwise injuring 
the inhabitants. 

You will hear again from me in a short time. Till then

CAMP AT SKENESBOROUGII, July 8, 1777. 

I had the honor of writing you this morning. Since then I have 
received a letter from General Frazer, which informs me of your 
intention of marching to-morrow. Your ships and tents are at 
present here ; and I suppose that you intend marching, in spite of the 
different opinions I have had upon the weather, with a view of joining me at this place. It is now my wish (since, by the retreat of the 
enemy to No. 4, communication is open) to unite as far as possible, 
the whole strength on this side. I beg that you will leave a sufficient 
guard for the wounded until they can be carried to Ticonderoga. 
You will, if possible, supply the guard with enough provisions to 
last one or two days ; and means will have to be found to supply 
them afterwards. The guard will soon be released by another corps.

HEAD QUARTERS, SKEENESBOROUGII HOUSE, July 10, 1777. 

Dear Sir: 

The reason for the movement of the left wing is to prevent any 
communication between No. 4 and Albany by way of Castletown, to 
afford protection to the loyal inhabitants, to frighten the disloyal, 
and to protect the hospital at Huberton. 

You will, therefore, have the goodness to take your position on 
the Castletown river, and send the corps of Lieutenant Colonel Brey- 
mann to the opposite side, where is the junction of the roads to 
Poultney and Rupert. 

The Hesse Hanau regiment will occupy the height of East Creek 
post, near the landing place, in order to secure this communication. 

After taking up this position, I desire you to use all means to en 
courage the inhabitants. You will offer them the protection of the 
king by placing sentinels in front of the houses and possessions of 
those who are known to be loyal, and by saving those houses which 
are empty until you receive further instructions, as I intend to 
appoint a certain time for the guilty ones to return, before resorting 
to military executions. 

I would also request you to punish soldiers or others under your 
command, who may be found guilty of plundering or otherwise 
abusing the inhabitants. 

I have the honor, etc., 

J. BURGOYNE.

HEAD QUARTERS AT SKEENESBOROUGH, July 18, 1777. 

I beg you will excuse my not having replied to your last two letters ; but I have been very much hurried in finishing my dispatches to the court. 

Your proposition to make a movement with your corps is entirely 
in accordance with rny wishes, and shows, in all its parts, the talents 
which you possess. The state of the weather, however, prevents me 
from making use of them, as there is danger of too greatly fatiguing 
your troops. 

It will be necessary to advance soon with the whole army. I am 
only waiting for the roads to be in a proper condition. 

I hope you will observe strict order in sending the baggage back 
to Ticonderoga, The baggage of the British officers has already 
been sent back, and some have only a small tent and a knapsack left. 
In the end, it is really the best thing for the officers to be particular 
upon this point. 

I have ordered the distribution of horses among the artillery. The 
remainder will then be portioned out to the troops. But their number is as yet insufficient to carry the tents of the soldiers. 

The inhabitants of your neighborhood give as an excuse for not 
bringing in cattle, that they were engaged in the service of your 
camp. I would be very much obliged to you if you would report to 
me the number of oxen, horses and wagons actually employed (in 
cluding the Haiiau regiment), that I may punish those who tell me 
falsehoods. 

We are at present engaged in transforming the new corps of 
provincials into regular troops. It is necessary for Mr. Sherwood to 
return with all his people as soon as possible, that their names may 
be placed upon the register and that other matters in regard to their 
enlistment may be settled. 

I have ordered four dozen bottles of port wine and the same 
quantity of madeira to be sent you. I am sorry that the present condition of my cellar does not allow me to send you a larger quantity 
and a better kind.

SKEENESBOROTJGH, July 23, 1777. 

I returned yesterday from my excursion of two days which I spent in reconnoitering Fort Ann and the country of the enemy 
too late to reply to the two letters of the 21st with which you honored me. 

The blocking up of the roads which the enemy have endeavored 
every where to destroy, forced me to postpone for one day the united 
movement and make a few alterations in the arrangement. The 
corps of Fra/er marched to-day. The right wing will follow the day 
after to-morrow (the 25th) ; and you will have the goodness to have 
the left wing occupy the same territory on which it encamped near 
Skeensborough. It is left to you, sir, either, for the accommodation 
of your troops, to march to-morrow to Castletown, or to make the 
whole distance in one day, or further if you find it advisable to 
embark your troops or part of them on East creek, according to the 
number and accommodation of your ships. It will be necessary to 
continue the march of the left wing on the 25th ; and it is left to 
your own judgment whether it would not be less fatiguing for the 
troops ,to bivouack during the night of the 25th than for them to 
transport their tents from the ships to the camp-ground only to re- 
embark them again on the next morning. 

By having the army thus march in divisions as far as Fort Ann, I 
shall prevent the confusion which the large number of ships would 
cause in the narrow passage of the creek. 

The enemy are in considerable force at Fort Edward, and appear 
to await us there. I very much doubt it : still, it will be necessary to 
take measures to advance against this position with sufficient force, 
and in such marching order that a line of battle can quickly be 
formed. 

Please bring with you all the wagons and teams you have and can 
muster, for which you will give the owners certificates. 

I will leave the other matters until I have the honor of seeing you. 
In the meantime, I remain with the greatest esteem, 

J. BURGOYNE. 

P. S. The enemy had the audacity to push forward a patrol of thirty-four men a quarter of a mile beyond Fort Ann. A deserter brought this news. A portion of our Indians, who had lately arrived, were quickly dispatched after them, and succeeded in capturing a captain and eighteen men; the rest were either killed or scattered. I believe this will be a good lesson to them. This letter will serve in 
the place of orders for your march to Skeensborough without my sending you a general order.

CAMP NEAR SARATOGA, August 13, 1777, 

10| o clock in the morning. 

Being desirous of not retarding your march this morning, I kept 
the details of this plan, intending to have it follow you. 

Mr. Baum reports to me that the enemy number 1,800 men, and 
that he, therefore, could not carry out the projected plan. He also 
states that lie is at present attacked, and expects reenforcement8. 

Confiding in the talents of this officer, I am convinced that you 
will find him at his post; and it depends on you according to 
what you may learn from the enemy either to make a new attack 
or to call back the detachment. 

The main thing is to arrange the retreat (if it be unavoidable), in 
such a manner as to give the enemy no chance to triumph over us, 
and no cause for discouragement to the Indians. To prevent this, 
all the animals and wagons, captured by the troops, must be kept. 
It would also, be very desirable to have the flour and corn taken 
away ; but since we have no means for doing this, they will have to 
be burned. 

Please report to me all that takes place. 

I have, etc., 

J. BURGOYNE.

August 25. 

I have had the honor of receiving your three letters, and have 
thoroughly considered the report of Colonel Breymann. Nothing 
can be said against the troops in regard to bravery. It is certain that 
the march of Mr. Breymann was very slow. It would have been 
better if he had left his artillery behind to follow after him under an 
escort, than to have delayed reenforcing the troops. 

Mr. Skene insists that it was impossible for Lieutenant Colonel 
Breymann not to have known of the encounter of Baum, since two 
or three officers, who had witnessed it, were with him in the mill. 
Skeue, however, says, that he himself knew nothing of the affair. 

It is also certain that the gunners fired at too great a distance. 
Finally, I consider it necessary to inclose the following order in the 
general instructions, which I communicate to you before it is pub 
lished, on account of the attention I owe you. I will wait until you 
honor me with your answer. 

You wiU find that then; are to-day more wagons for the trans 
portation of articles to Fort Ann. I am very impatient and anxious 
to have the provisions with us for the march against the enemy. 
The moment is a decisive one ; and with your keen perception you 
will readily see that our communication with Fort Ann is too ex 
tended and too much exposed for us to depend on being supplied 
much longer, when our army shall have advanced a little further. 
Consider, also, that it will be necessary to leave all the wagons at 
Stillwater, and that all transportation from Fort Ann will then cease. 
I say all this to you in confidence ; and you will keep it secret. It 
has been reported to me that wagons are to come from Fort George. 
Orders will be given that the wagons, you mention, shall be furnished 
to Breymann s corps. 

Will you have the kindness to send hither to-morrow a troop of 
six or eight dragoons. I expect to have about ten horses which you 
may have to enable you to begin the mounting of your escadron ; 
and I will try in every way to complete it. 

Your letter to Baum I will send into the enemy s lines by a 
drummer. 

I have, etc., 

J. BUIUJOYNE. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

August 26, 1777. 

I had the honor of writing you last night, and informing you that 
I had received the intelligence that a strong patrol of the enemy 
about 200 men have marched against Fort Ann, and requesting 
you to send a sufficient escort from your post with carts in case 
enough of them should arrive. 

I sent the letter by a courier, who, I fear, has lost his way in the 
dark. I therefore, send Lieutenant Wilford with this one, though I 
confess that I shall not be at ease until I receive an answer to this letter. 
A failure would not only be a mortification, but detrimental for the 
future transportation of supplies. I feel assured that all the carts we 
possess, are engaged for this purpose. 

If I am right in this latter conjecture, then the measures of those 
who sent them from Fort Edward were well meant, but this was not 
my order. 

If a sufficient escort, under an officer, who carefully covers his 
flanks and front to guard against surprise (for the chief talents of an 
army should be directed to this end), has marched, then send Mr. 
Wilford back at once with the intelligence. 

But in either case, I request you to send an officer in advance to 
prevent any delay of the teams on so dangerous a road. The severe 
rain has very likely made the travel extremely difficult ; and it 
would, therefore, be better to put on the carts only half of a load 
(leaving the rest in the woods), than to have them stick fast in the 
mud and the horses driven away. 

I wish when you arrive, you would retain sufficient provisions to 
last your corps six days, and send the balance to Fort Edward. If 
the condition of the roads renders it practicable, and nothing is seen 
of the enemy, then the few teams that have started can keep on. 
But the carts I would not like to venture on another route. It is 
better to leave the rest behind. 

Should it be necessary to partly unload the carts, then by all means 
do not take off the flour, but carry it as far as possible. 

I have, etc., 

J. BUHGOYNE. 

P. S. Just as I am closing this letter, my courier arrives. Never 
theless, I send Mr. Wilford, as I still think that it will be better, as 
the roads are so bad, not to have the carts return for a second load. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

August 31, 1777. 

I beg you to accept my apology for not sooner answering the letter 
with which you honored me on the 29th. 

Regarding Fort George, it is my intention to leave there four 
companies of the 47th Regiment, two of which will occupy the fort, 
and the remainder the island three miles distant from the land. 1 I 
take it for granted that the fort is safe against any surprise, no matter 
how strong the attacking party may be. In case of an assault, the 
garrison can still retreat through the open ditch, to the island, 2 
whither the enemy can never go, being destitute of ships, while we, 
on the contrary, have gunboats. 

The island will, also, be a place in which to keep valuables ; and 
the officer, who remains there to command the four companies, will 
be instructed to carry out this order. 

I beg that you will have the guard for your baggage as small as 
possible. I will order the English regiments to do the same. In 
this way, we shall approach the enoniy as strong as is in our power. 

It will not be advisable to have guards (posts) between Fort George 
and the army. Communication will, therefore, be very hazardous. 
In order to neutralize this, however, I am now engaged in having a 
transportable magazine built, which will be ready in a very few days. 
As soon as this is completed, your corps will at once join the army. 3 

I am also endeavoring to procure horses, both for mounting the 
dragoons, and for the transportation service. 

I have just this moment heard* a rumor which gives me much 
uneasiness. It is said that several ships (some fifty), are still between 
Fort Ann and Skenesborough. If this rumor is true, then Major 
(?) made a great mistake in leaving his post without first allowing them to pass. I beg you, my dear sir, to send an escort with 
Captain Harrington, who has the honor of carrying this letter to 
you, and who is to investigate this matter. It seems to me, that this 
may be productive of disagreeable consequences, nothing short of 
furnishing the means to the enemy of reaching Super-Hill near Ti- 
conderoga by the South river, 1 and of alarming our guard at the 
portage. Therefore, in case the ships are of any number, and in suffi 
ciently good condition to be transported, and the country is clear of 
the enemy, let them be brought through Skeensborough to Ticon- 
deroga by a skillful manoeuvre of the two companies of the 47th, 
whose province it will be to garrison the island. You will please 
give them their orders in conformity with the report of Captain Har 
rington. In case, however, the number of the ships are too small, I 
desire to have them burned or destroyed. I have, etc , 

J. BURGOYNE. 

P. S. Please present my compliments to the baroness, and my 
readiness to serve her in any way when you march. I foresee great 
fatigues for a lady. B.

September 10, 1777. 

The last orders have been given to have nothing remain in Fort 
George. The last of the wagons will accordingly pass Fort Edward 
either to-niorrow evening or Friday morning ; and you will then be 
able to march with all the troops that are now with you. 

General Gates, having considered it best to reoccupy the position at 
Stillwater, I desire to contract my front somewhat before crossing the 
river. I have, therefore, postponed the advance of Frazer s and Brey- 
mann s corps until to-morrow. As everything is on the retrograde, 
and the ships are loading with provisions) this postponement involves 
no loss of time. 

I have, my dear general, to intrust a little matter to your care, 
during your stay at Fort Edward. 2 I desire to have two ships, with 
their oars, buried as quietly as possible. It would, also, be well to shovel earth upon them ; and to give them still more the appearance 
of graves, a cross might be placed upon each hillock. All this must be 
done in the night, and only by trustworthy soldiers. The teamsters 
cannot be relied on. 

The use for which these ships are intended, is to help Lieutenant 
Colonel St. Leger in crossing the river, in case of circumstances 
forcing him to march without his ships. 1 This officer has been forced 
by the bad conduct of the Indians, to retreat on the road to Oswego. 
He has, however, accomplished this without loss, and is now on his 
march to the army. I have sent him orders as to the necessary mea 
sures of precaution he is to take upon arriving on the island at the 
lower end 2 of Lake George. If he finds that the enemy are not in the 
vicinity of the road leading to the army, and he can keep the march 
of twenty- four men a secret, he is to cross the river near Fort Ed 
ward, at the same time notifying me, in advance, of his movement, 
that I may be able to facilitate it from my side. I have told him 
where he will find the ships, viz : inside of Fort Edward. 

I have given orders to Brigadier General Powell to have your 
reserves cross at the same time with Colonel St. Leger, and to leave 
those only behind that belong to the regiment of Prince Frederick. 
If you have any special orders to give your officer, you may send your 
letter by the officer who has the honor of taking this to you. 

Respectfully, etc., 

J. BURGOYNE.

MISCELLANEOUS EXTRACTS FROM RIEDESEL S JOURNAL. 

Arrival of the First Brunswick Division in America. 
On the morning of the 25th of May, 1776, on waking, we found 
ourselves fourteen or fifteen leagues from Cape Catt near the Cammel 
mountains. By ten o clock we had a most favorable east wind, which 
would, as Captain Bell (our captain) assured us, bring us the same 
evening to the Isle Pic. Although the weather was stormy, the wind 
continued favorable. Finally, at three in the afternoon we came in 
sight of the longed for Isle Pic. The frigate Juno gave the signal to 
cast anchors at seven and a half o clock. All the captains of the different transports were then ordered to go aboard the Juno, and every 
one expected, as a matter of course, that they would there procure 
their pilots ; especially, since we had met the frigate Surprise (under Captain Lincee) near the island. The latter had lain there several 
days waiting for us. But on the return of our captain to the Pallas 
we were informed that the fleet, with the Irish regiments, had arrived 
the day before, and had taken all the pilots. 

Captain Dalrimple, in the meantime, resolved to venture it without 
a pilot, and continue on to Quebec as soon as a favorable wind would 
allow. In the middle of the night there arose a sudden blast, which 
forced us to cast out a second anchor ; and, as it was, several of the 
ships were torn loose from their moorings. This was, also, the more 
dangerous as the water at this place was full of rocks. 

On the IGth we had the finest weather, but owing to the wind being 
contrary, were obliged to continue at anchor. In the afternoon, General Ricdesel availed himself of this delay to pay a visit to General Bur- 
goyne, on board the Blonde. On this occasion he went ashore on the 
Isle Pic distant about 1,300 paces from the ship. 

This island is surrounded by rocks, and the approach of the vessels 
was thereby very much endangered. All kinds of shells and the 
skeletons of whales were found on the shore. Among the various 
kinds of trees were the pine and the birch. The smell of the former 
is a great deal stronger here than in the north of Germany. The soil 
was covered by all kinds of herbs and plants, some of which we were 
familiar with. The atmosphere here was altogether warmer and of a 
better quality than that on board the ship. But few families have 
settled here, and those belong to pilots. Pilots are also sent here 
from Quebec when necessary. General Riedesel met General Bur- 
goyne on board of the Blonde. The latter was in the act of leaving 
the ship to go on board the Surprise preparatory to sailing in advance 
to Quebec, whither he desired to proceed to arrange matters there for 
the troops as Carleton had left that city in pursuit of the enemy. At 
eight in the evening, thirteen guns thundered from the Blonde, as 
Burgoyne left that ship and embarked on the Surprise. 

At twelve at night, the anchors were hoisted, and the voyage was 
continued on the 27th under a favorable wind. We kept very near 
the right or southern bank of the river, passing close to Cap a 1 Ori- 
ginal, afterward Road island, which is at the mouth of the Sageyney 
river. On the shore we saw here and there a settlement of colonists. 
About ten we passed Green island, and saw at a distance a most 
magnificent waterfall. After passing this island, we could overlook 
a great portion of the southern shore of the river, with its houses and 
farms, very pleasing to the eye, and especially to our eyes, as we had 
not seen the like in a long time. The left or northern shore was at 
this point not cultivated, for the high mountains come down to the 
water s edge. Our Englishmen assured us that the side beyond the 



278 OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS RELATING 

mountains was better cultivated than even the south side, and that 
there was actually a good road leading to Quebec. 

Toward noon we approached more toward the northern shore and 
passed Hare island, so named from the large numbers of that ani 
mal found in it. The hares of Canada are white in winter and their 
natural color in summer. The water here is yet saline and is fifty 
fathoms deep. At five o clock we, saw a nice little village on the 
southern shore, which numbered about fifty houses, including a 
church. This village was thought to be La Bouteillerie. On this 
day we reached Kamaraska islands, and cast anchor between them 
and the Mal-Bai at eight o clock. Thus Cape Gose was in front of 
us. On this day we made twenty-six leagues. 

Anchors were weighed at eight on the morning of the 28th. The 
weather was clear, and the wind favorable. We saw a great many 
porpoises playing in the water. Judging from their color, they are a 
different species from the ones we saw at sea, for those were white 
while these are grey. The white porpoises are said to exist only in 
the St. Lawrence and the Bay of Finnlancl. During this day s voy 
age we saw both shores strewn with settlements, some of which were 
surrounded by large tracts of cleared land. 

At twelve M. we came in sight of the Island Aux Coudres. This 
island was designated as the general rendezvous for all the ships that 
were driven out of their course. The shores, as well the channel of 
the river, are here full of rocks and cliffs ; and it is, therefore, impos 
sible to get along without a pilot. We accordingly cast anchor. 

At the expiration of an hour pilots came on board from the island, 
and conducted some of our ships (among them the Pallas) to another 
anchorage. This was between the north side of the Isle aux Coudres 
and the left shore of the river. It was just at low tide, and the cur 
rent of the water was so strong, that the ships bad to be pulled along 
by row boats. From the pilots we ascertained that the fleet with the 
English regiments had passed the island the Sunday previous, and 
that it had taken with it all the other pilots. They are, however, 
expected back this clay. 

It was two o clock when we cast anchor for the second time, having 
made sixteen leagues from the Isle of Kamaraska. A curious acci 
dent, occurred on our first casting anchor, which came very near 
resulting in the destruction of the Pallas and the Apollo. The cap 
tains of these two vessels accidentally cast anchor at one and the 
same time. The consequence was that the anchors and ropes became 
so entangled that the two ships were in the very act of coming into 
collision. We did not notice the danger until the crews of the other 
ships by great outcries drew our attention to the danger, at the same 



TO GEN. EIEDESEVS CAMPAIGN. 279 

time sending, in all haste, their boats, with a view of saving as many 
lives as possible. At first our sailors seemed to be at a loss what to 
do. The steersman left his rudder, not knowing what the matter 
was, and fearing to make things worse by turning the ships. But this 
confusion happened only during the first moments. Captain Ilaynes 
very soon got to work himself. He ordered Captain Bell to be 
ready to cut the cable ; and at the very moment when a collision 
appeared likely, Captain Foy ran to the wheel, and gave the Pallas so 
skillful a turn that both ships passed each other safely ; their cables 
disentangled themselves ; and no other damage was done, except the 
tearing of some of the sails and the breaking of a few of the spars. 

In the afternoon Captain Haynes sent to the Isle aux Coudres for 
all the rest of the pilots to bring up the ships left behind. Five were 
found, and these were distributed among the vessels. At four in the 
afternoon the pilots who had taken the English regiments to Quebec, 
returned in two vessels; and there was now no scarcity in the article 
of pilots. It was just then low tide ; the wind was unfavorable ; and 
it was therefore determined that the ships should lie at anchor. 
Meanwhile, as the weather was beautiful, General Riedesel went on 
shore to see the island. 

The base of it consists of nothing but useless slate-stone rocks 
which reach out of the water on all sides. The island is three leagues 
long, with a circumference of from six to seven leagues. It contains 
about three hundred inhabitants who live in sixty-five dwellings. It 
belongs to the bishop at Quebec, to whom the inhabitants pay a 
yearly sum at the rate of one shilling for each acre of land. Those 
who settled here eighty years ago are all French and Catholics, like 
all the rest of the Canadians. The island, otherwise, is under the 
protection of the governor of the province Quebec, who appoints for 
the inhabitants three officers taken from among them. A new one is 
elected each year, the oldest one in office giving place to the person 
newly elected. Thus each hold office for three years. 

On the east and north side where we disembarked, we found the 
newest settlements, which are scattered here and there. On the south 
and west side are the oldest settlements. These latter form a village 
with a church, called La Balaine. The atmosphere here must be 
very healthy, since we had mentioned and shown to us many old 
people who had emigrated to the island with their parents eighty 
years ago. The number of aged people far exceeds the proportion of 
old people in Europe. 

Here we saw for the first time the Canadian costume. This is, 
among the men, somewhat in the same style as the dress of the 
Indians. Without being artificial, it is in correspondence with the 



280 OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS EELATING 

climate. Over their shirts, which are frequently made of colored 
linen or of printed calico, they wear small waistcoats of different 
stuffs according to the season of the year. Over this, again, they 
wear a long jacket of white woolen cloth reaching down to their 
knees. This is ornamented with all kinds of colored ribbons, which 
serve the place of buttons. Around the waist they wear scarfs, which 
keeps the w r aistcoat or capote (as they style it), close together. This 
scarf is made of different colored yarn, and makes quite a display. 
In the winter they wear longer capotes of cloth, or the skins of the 
porpoise, which they understand perfectly how to prepare for this 
purpose, having learned it from the Indians. Pantaloons are worn 
by all the men summer and winter, with the exception of those who 
go about a great deal with the savages. But even these use ties or 
. aprons, in order not to offend delicacy. They clothe their legs with 
a sort of leggins, called in the Indian language mitas. They are 
worn inside their shoes, reach half way up to the thigh, and are put 
on w T ith the stockings. On the outside, where our splatter-dashes 
have buttons, is a piece of cloth or fringe, about as broad as a hand, 
which runs down to the foot and keeps flying round their legs as 
they walk. This superfluous piece is partly for ornament and partly 
for use against snakes, who, if not noticed, will generally bite this 
piece of cloth, leaving their poison in it. For the same reason we 
shall have the long, wide sailor pants introduced in our army. 

The shoes of the Canadian are the real mocas of the Indians, and 
are, therefore, called souliers sauvages. Most every one makes these 
shoes himself, but the Indians make them the nicest. The ordinary 
ones are made of the hide of the porpoise and shaped very like 
a leather tobacco-pouch. They are attached to the foot by leathern 
thongs below the ankle. 

The scarcity of hats causes most every one to wear red woolen 
caps. Nor, if the Canadian washes to be dressed up will he wear 
any other color. The aristocracy dress in European style, but in the 
country they wear their mitas and souliers sauvages like every one 
else. This class, in winter, wear long capotes, cauadiens, 1 of white 
cloth with ribbons, or castor furs over their clothing, and casquets of 
the most beautiful fur instead of hats. The Canadian ladies dress in 
French fashion. 

We found the houses of the farmers on the Isle aux Coudres, and 
indeed throughout all Canada, without any pretensions to architec 
tural beauty. They are generally built of long beams, cut square, 
and laid on top of one another and joined at the corners. The inner walls are covered with boards of cedar or pine. There is little com- 
modiousness in them. The houses throughout Canada are covered 
with shingles. 

Agriculture is carried on in the same manner as with us ; but no 
winter grain can be raised in Canada, They raise wheat, barley, 
oats, aliltlc Indian corn or maize. Everything is sown in the begin 
ning of May, and harvested after four months. Peas, beans, lentiles, 
vetches, all kinds of cabbage and onions, and potatoes are also raised. 
The soil, which seems to be marly on the island, bears abundantly 
for five consecutive years with a little manure. After that time it is 
not cultivated for two years. 

We found all kinds of European cattle and fowls in abundance. 

Of the wild animals, there are many black, grey and red foxes. 
The black, however, are very scarce owing to their being so much 
hunted. A high price is paid for these skins at Quebec. Hares, of 
which there were formerly a great number on the island, have mostly 
been exterminated by the foxes. There are few deer, except in winter 
when they cross the ice. In the woods and near the water there are 
many snipes, etc. ; and at times white partridges, many kinds of wild 
ducks, and wild geese. A species of singing bird attracted our atten 
tion, the singing of which is somewhat similar to that of our nightin 
gale, and which are, therefore, called, by the inhabitants, rossiynols 
du pays. Their shape and size are very similar to canary birds. In 
color they are black and yellow. 

A small streamlet, which winds its way through the island, fur 
nishes beautiful trout, and other kinds of fish, a few of which we knew. 

Of trees we particularly noticed the Canadian cedar. Of this, there 
are several varieties, all of which have a strong odor. The maple 
grow r s here exceedingly high, and is of great use to the inhabitants 
who make sugar of its sap, which they called sucre cCerable or du pays. 
In appearance, it is a brackish yellow. In taste, it is, with the exception of a resinous flavor, like ordinary sugar. A maple tree around 
which a man can reach his arms, furnishes three pounds of sugar. 
Some of the people here make from 400 to 500 pounds of sugar on 
the district of woods assigned to them. This they sell at Quebec for 
one-half of an English shilling per pound. 

There are many white and red epinettes J in this place. Of the latter 
kind the Canadian makes a sort of beer, called by the English, sprouts- 
beer. It is healthy, very refreshing, and, when one has become 
accustomed to it, good tasting. The twigs and leaves are cooked in 
water, toasted bread, molasses or syrup being added to sweeten it. 
Some improve it by boiling it with a quantity of wheat. 

The St. Lawrence, which is here still salty, furnishes the inhabit 
ants with flounders, salmon and codfish. There are also, many 
seals ; but their capture is no longer made a business, except so far as 
their oil is needed on the island. The white porpoises are taken 
more on account of their skin. 

Of wild plants we saw many strawberries, huckleberries, succory, 
scurvy -grass and wild salad of all kinds. All the trade of this island 
is carried on with Quebec. To this latter place there were carried 
last year 1,100 minots of corn at three and one-half shillings, and 
more than 5,000 pounds of sugar at six-pence. Besides these two 
chief articles of commerce, the inhabitants sell their superfluous pro 
visions and other articles. 

At eight o clock in the evening of the 28th, we returned again to 
the Pallas. The tide changed at nine o clock, and the pilots availed 
themselves of this opportunity to place the ships on the west side of 
the island, and there await a favorable wind. This was accomplished 
by twelve at night, when we cast anchor 2,000 paces from our old 
position. 

Here we remained all of the 29th, on account of contrary winds. 
On the morning of that day an officer arrived in a pilot boat from 
Quebec. He brought the news that we were not to stop at all at 
Quebec, but would proceed at once to Montreal to support General 
Carleton. He further stated that after the arrival of the 29th English 
regiment (the first reenforcement), the rebels had at once retreated 
to Montreal leaving behind four cannon and a great quantity of 
ammunition. Carleton thereupon went in pursuit, and captured 
500 men. 

On the 8th, the 47th (Carleton s own regiment), arrived and im 
mediately started on its march from Quebec to Montreal. On the 
24th, the fleet, with the Irish regiments, arrived, and also followed 
the corps of Carleton without delay. An unpleasant piece of intelligence, however, was, also, imparted to us by this officer, viz : that 
Howe had been forced to evacuate Boston, and had retreated to 
Halifax. This last report, however, regarding the retreat to Halifax, 
had not been confirmed. 

Between ten and eleven o clock on the 30th of May the anchors 
were weighed by order of the pilots ; and we continued our voyage 
among rocks and sand banks without accident, until five and a half in 
the afternoon, when we reached Cape Tormento, where the so-called 
traverses begin. The passage at this point is very narrow, diffictilt 
and dangerous, unless one pays strict attention to the course of the vessel. There are two of these traverses, the old and the new one. 
The wind went down before we reached them, and we cast anchor 
at eight in the evening after a voyage of three leagues. The Isle of 
Orleans was now directly before us. 

On the morning of the 31st, as soon as the tide changed, we again 
weighed anchor. Some of the pilots selected the new, and some the 
old traverse, and some went below both of them, near the Isle de 
Patience. The wind remained unfavorable ; and it being low tide at 
six in the morning, we cast anchor near St. John s point. Here we 
remained until two in the afternoon ; and while we were waiting, we 
inspected a large portion of the Island of Orleans with its beautiful 
tillage. 

The whole island. is under most excellent cultivation, and is strewn 
with houses and villages. It is this island from which Quebec 
draws most of her supplies for housekeeping. Beautiful land and 
tine cattle are the sources whence the islanders draw their wealth. 
It is thirteen English miles long, and contains six parishes. It is south 
western and lies very close to Quebec. 

At two in the afternoon, we continued our voyage until six o clock 
with great difficulty ; and, indeed, on account of contrary winds, 
made very little headway. Finally, after making that day in all but 
six leagues, we cast anchor between St. John s point and Dauphin s 
point. 

At one o clock in the morning of June 1st, again we started, and 
continued our voyage until six o clock. On account, however, of the 
change in the tide, we were obliged to cast anchor at Laurent point. 
This latter place is on the Island of Orleans. 

At three o clock p. M., the anchors were hoisted for the last time ; 
and, under a favorable wind, we passed the beautiful waterfall of 
Montmorency, which filled us all with admiration. Finally, at six 
in the evening we reached the harbor of Quebec, having made this 
day, eight leagues. 

General Riedesel at once went into the city to pay his respects to 
General Carleton, and report to him the arrival of the German troops. 
The latter, since the 30th, had been back at Quebec, having left his 
corps for the present in charge of General Burgoyne, who was with 
it near Three Rivers. 

Late in the evening Carleton sent one of his adjutants on board 
our ship, to inquire into the effective strength of the dragoon and 
Prince Frederick s regiments, the governor having chosen them as 
part of the garrison at Quebec. 

All our ships had now arrived, except the Harmony, on board of 
which was Lieutenant Colonel Specht and part of the regiment Riedesel. Investigation, however, soon revealed the fact that this vessel 
had arrived ak Quebec as early as May 27th, and had been ordered to 
sail to Three Rivers with the rest of the ships that had arrived. The 
troops on board of the Harmony were, therefore, the only ones of all 
the Brunswick troops who afterward took part in the small engagements of the 8th and 9th of June near Three Rivers. 

During the night of the 1st of June, all the ships came up that had 
lagged behind the evening previous. The fleet which we met at 
Quebec, was, including ours, very numerous. Besides the transports 
with troops and provisions there were a large number of merchant 
vessels detained in the harbor on account of tne enlisting troubles. 

The city of Quebec, which lies for the most part on a high moun 
tain, is not what it once was. The entire west side is fortified, but 
the fortifications are in a dilapidated state, although an attempt was 
made last winter and is still making, to put them somewhat in repair 
as quickly as possible. We found on the walls about 81 iron cannons 
and a few mortars. These latter had been brought up in all haste 
from the old frigates, in case they should be needed for the defense 
of the city. The city numbers at the present time about 1,500 houses, 
having lately lost 500, which were leveled to the ground by the orders 
of General Carleton. 1 

Being obliged to go every noon to the head quarters at Quebec to 
receive our orders, I found an opportunity of inspecting the memo 
rable mountain which the English general, Wolf, ascended in Decem 
ber, 1759, after his capture of the city, and when he, as well as the 
French general, Montcalm,lost his life. We also saw the spot where 
the rebel leader, Montgomery, fell, when he vainly attempted to gain 
a footing at the close of last year with the intention of driving General 
Carleton out of Quebec. 

On the 3d, the frigate Blonde left Quebec as the advance guard to 
Three Rivers and Montreal. 

General Carleton s plan for the capture of Montreal was now 
arranged. In accordance with it the troops were to be distributed 
and disembarked on both banks of the St. Lawrence in the following 
manner : The regiment of Prince Frederick and the dragoons, as 
already stated, were to remain as a garrison for Quebec under Lieu 
tenant Colonel Baum who was made commander of the city. This 
garrison was to furnish, besides the post in the city, one outpost on 
the opposite bank of the river at point Levi, to consist of 300 men 
under a staff officer. 

Major General Von Riedesel was to disembark with his corps on 
the southern bank of the St. Lawrence, and march parallel with the 
English column of the northern shore of that river. The corps of 
Riedesel consisted of a body of savages and Canadians ; the regiment 
of Colonel McLean (with which General Carleton had defended the 
city all winter, and which was recently formed of Scotchmen, exiles 
and Canadians) the grenadier battalion, and the regiments Riedesel 
and Hesse Hanau. The corps of Carleton, under command of Lieu 
tenant General Burgoyne, and consisting of the 9th, 20th, 21st, 24th, 
29th, 31st, 34th, 47th and 62d regiments, and the whole artillery 
under Major General Phillips, were to disembark on the northern 
bank of the river, and march directly to Three Rivers and Montreal. 

The disembarking of all the troops near Quebec was to take 
place on the 8th and 9th of June ; but the dragoon regiment disem 
barked as early as the 6th, and went into quarters in the city. The 
same course would have been pursued with the regiment Prince 
Frederick, had the barracks, which were designated for it, been 
ready. 

On the morning of the 7th, the horses were taken out of the ship 
Martha, and sent to pasture at Beauport to pick up. Our sick, also, 
to the number of 20 men, were taken from the vessels, and placed in 
the hospital at Quebec. 

At noon, the chiefs of the wild nations such as the Abenakis, 
Iroquois, Outawais and Hurons were admitted to an interview 
with General Carleton. He had them all clothed in their costume, 
and arms given them. They had on their war paint, their eyes 
being painted red. They had, also, daubed their newly received 
blankets with red paint to show that they were ready to light. Some 
of them had traveled a distance of 450 English miles. 

On the 7th, the order suddenly came that, if the wind were favorable, the anchors should be weighed at four in the afternoon, in order 
to gain as much ground as possible during the two succeeding days. 
Accordingly, all the ships started at the given time, and cast anchor 
once more at Cape Rouge, a distance of three leagues from Quebec. 

At eight o clock on the morning of June 8th, the entire fleet again 
got under way. On both banks there was the most pleasing diversity 
of beautiful landscape interspersed with many neat settlements. We 
sailed with a northeast wind about nine leagues, and cast anchor at 
two o clock in the afternoon near Cape L Oisseau. Here we met, 
besides the frigate Triton and our Blonde, many transports with 
English infantry. 

Major General Von Riedesel went on board the Triton in the hope 
of obtaining some pilots, as he was anxious to proceed with his corps. 



286 OFFICIAL D CUMENTS RE LA TING 

There were not, however, a sufficient number for all the ships ; and 
we were, therefore, obliged to remain here for the present. All the 
vessels hoisted the blue flag, because that was the color of Captain 
Lodwidge s flag, and he was an older captain than the one in com 
mand of the Blonde. 

At ten o clock on the morning of the 9th, the entire fleet again 
started with a favorable wind. We passed the heights of Decham- 
beault, where we found the wreck of a rebel ship which had stranded 
there the year previous. 

At ten in the evening, we had the Cape de la Madelaine, on the 
northern shore, on our right, and Be^ancourt, on the southern shore, 
on our left. Here we received orders to cast anchor, having made 
seventeen leagues. 

At noon of the same day, we received news of the engagements of 
the 8th and 9th near Three Rivers. 

On the morning of the 10th, General Riedesel went to the head 
quarters at Three Rivers, General Carleton having arrived there 
the evening of the 8th by the land route. It was then ordered that 
those of the troops who had been disembarked to take part in the 
engagement, should at once be reembarked and proceed with the 
rest. At the parole, it was announced that his majesty had appointed 
his excellency, Lieutenant General Carleton, captain general and 
governor of the province of Quebec. 

It was also announced that Generals Burgoyne, Riedesel and Phillips, 
and Lieutenant Colonels Beckwith, Frazer, Powell and Gordon (these 
last four as brigadier generals) were to serve under him in Canada, 
as long as his majesty saw fit. 

To Brigadier General Frazer, first of all, was given the command 
of all those troops that could not as yet be disembarked, viz : the 
savages, Canadians, English grenadiers, the companies of light in 
fantry of all the English regiments in Canada, and the newly formed 
English regiment McLean. 

The left wing was to consist of all the Brunswick regiments, and 
the regiment Hesse Hanau, under the command of Major General 
Von Riedesel ; but General Burgoyne was to command both wings. 

On the morning of the llth, we advanced with our ships three 
leagues to Three Rivers. In pursuance of orders, the prisoners, 
which had been taken on the 8th and 9th, were examined. Most of 
them were Germans from the province of Pennsylvania. Judging 
by their uniforms, also, they were soldiers. They belonged to seven 
different regiments. The wounded of both sides had been carried to 
the convent of the Ursulines, where these benevolent uuns constantly 
keep a hospital, and take very good care of the sick. 



TO GEN. RIEDESEUti CAMPAIGN. 287 

On the 12th, we had contrary winds all day, obliging us to remain 
at anchor. General Carletou, however, wished the army in ac 
cordance with the general plan laid down to commence operations 
as soon as possible. Accordingly, Riedesel, under an escort of an 
officer and thirty men, went on shore, and inspected the southern 
bank of the St. Lawrence, in the vicinity of Riviere de Godefroy, 
with a view of finding a suitable spot for his troops to encamp on. 

He returned on board the Pallas at three o clock on the morning of 
the 13th, and went thence immediately to General Carleton at Three 
Rivers to report upon the condition of the southern shore. Scarcely 
had he entered the boat for the purpose of crossing over, when a 
splendid breeze sprang up ; whereupon the signal to weigh anchors 
was given. General Riedesel, therefore, returned on board the Pallas 
after W T C were one league from our anchorage. The ship Elisabeth, 
from which the escort had been taken, was obliged to send for it, as 
well as for Captain Gerlach. 

We entered Lake St. Pierre with our fleet at eight o clock, but the 
wind died away so toward noon that we were again forced to cast 
anchor. The ships received orders, how to act in case the rebels 
should attempt any hostile movement. The guns were loaded, strong 
guards were placed on the decks, and the men were ordered to hail 
each other every fifteen minutes. In addition, also, to this, the boats 
of the frigates were obliged to patrol around the ships constantly, 
and thus keep every one on the alert. The savages and also the 
Canadians patroled continually in their canoes day and night along 
both banks of the river. General Carleton was on board the small 
sloop of war Martin, of fourteen guns, under Captain Harway, as 
large frigates, on account of the depth of water, were now of no 
further use. 

On the 14th, we cautiously continued our voyage (prepared to dis 
embark at a moment s notice) in the following order: First, the 
sloop of war Martin forming the tete. Then came 1st, the ships 
having on board the English light infantry ; 3d, a few with the English light artillery ; 3d, the English brigades ; 4th, the Brunswick 
and Hessian troops ; 5th, the ships with the 2d and 3d English 
brigades ; 6, those with the English artillery ; and lastly, the transports 
containing the provisions. Many canoes filled with savages and 
Canadians went close to the shores, and reported from time to time 
concerning the patrols that had been sent ahead in the woods. On 
this day, Carleton was on board the small frigate Rousseau. 

The same morning it was ascertained, through the Canadian 
patrols, that the corps of the rebels which numbered 1,500 men, 
and had fortified itself at Sorel had, upon seeing our ships, evacuated that position the day previous, and fallen back to Fort Chambly. 
Toward evening we arrived at Sorel, and at once disembarked a 
portion of the English troops (consisting of Frazer s brigade), to 
take possession of this post. 

On the morning of the 15th, the first English brigade, with a part 
of the artillery, were also landed at Sorel. It was at first thought 
that the German corps would likewise be disembarked at this place, 
as Captain Gerlach was obliged to land on the southern shore early 
in the morning in order to look at the place designated for us. Carle- 
ton, however, changed his mind on this point, and our disembarkation 
was again postponed. We sailed on this day a few thousand paces 
beyond Sorel, and cast anchor. According to Carleton s orders the 
German troops were again to be the cue-stick. 1 

On the 16th it was ascertained that the enemy acted as if he also 
intended to evacuate Fort Chambly. At three o clock, in the after 
noon, Captain Yon Tunderfeld, 2 was sent on board the Pallas, with 
orders that all the troops should be disembarked and furnished with 
four clays rations. The church in the parish of Bergeres was designated as the rendezvous for all the troops that should land on the 
southern shore. They w r ere to march there by companies. In fact, 
all were landed on the south bank, with the exception of the 29th 
Regiment, which upon Carleton learning that Montreal had been 
evacuated by the enemy w T as ordered to do garrison duty, for the 
present, in that city and vicinity. 

The disembarking of the troops progressed very slowly, owing to 
the fact that only the ships boats could be used for that purpose, the 
other boats and bateaux, although promised us, not having ar 
rived, and it being impossible to procure others at so short notice. 
It was, therefore, six o clock P. M. before all the troops were on 
shore. 

At first, the march for troops who had been on board the vessel 
so long was very fatiguing. Nor was it rendered easier by the 
heavy rain which fell during the whole of the night s march. The 
men had to carry their blankets, the weight of which grew heavier 
every moment by the rain. They marched through the parishes of 
La Tour and Centre Cosur, and thence to Bergeres, a distance of 
seven good leagues. General Riedesel reached the latter parish 
during the night, where he found that Carleton had arrived in the 
evening. Here the German troops were quartered ; and spent their 
first night on American soil.

THE UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT OF THE AMERICANS NEAR THREE RIVERS, JUNE 9TH, 1770. 

[Extract from RiedeseVs Journal.} 

The rebels, who still numbered at that time 5,000 men, had at first 
resolved to make a stand at Three Rivers ; but the arrival of the first 
small reenforcements of the English, leading them to expect that 
more were to follow, so frightened them, that they dared not retain 
their position, but fell back to Montreal and the south side of the 
river. 

Neither Generals Carleton nor Burgoyne were able to pursue the 
enemy any further with the small number of men with which they 
had hitherto opposed the enemy. They determined, therefore, to 
wait until their reenforcements should come up; and, accordingly, 
Burgoyne ordered those of our troops who had arrived in the vicinity 
of Three Rivers to remain there under the command of Brigadier 
General Frazer. 

Frazer himself was in the city, and had no other troops on shore, 
except a small body of Indians, a few Canadian volunteers, a part of 
McLean s regiment, and a small detachment of English troops that 
had been taken from the ships at Three Rivers for the purpose of 
strengthening his post, 

Meanwhile, the rebels having learned from some disloyal Canadians in that region, that Frazer was on land with only 300 men, 
resolved to surprise him. Accordingly, a corps of 1,500 rebels was 
sent across the river from Sorel, with the design of going around 
Frazer, and getting in the rear of Three Rivers from Les Forges. It 
is believed that this attempt of the rebels would have been successful, 
had not the guide, who conducted them through the woods, been a 
good royalist. He was cute enough to lead the rebel corps over a 
circuitous road, thus enabling Frazer not only to be on his guard, 
but to rally all the troops from the ships and give the enemy a hearty 
welcome. He went out to meet him on the road to Montreal, and 
soon came in sight of his column. Frazer, thereupon, ordered a halt, 
and had one of the English regiments lie down on a gentle rise of 
ground, and pour upon the enemy, who suspected nothing, a well 
directed and spirited fire. The Americans, astonished at such an 
unexpected welcome, turned in dismay and fled toward their bateaux. 
The brigadier, however, pursued and scattered them so effectually, 
that his men had work enough for a day and a half in ferreting the 
rascals out of their hiding places into which they had crept. Two 
hundred of them were captured, and among them their leader, a 
certain Thomson, who represents a so-called general. Besides him, a lieutenant colonel, four officers and a surgeon were taken. On our 
side, eight were killed, two dangerously, and nine slightly wounded. 
The troops of the regiment Riedesel, who were on board the ship 
Harmony, formed the reserve. The spot where this affair took place, 
is between Three Rivers and La Baulieu, or the field on the heights of 
Three Rivers.

ADDRESS OP JOHN BURGOYNE, 

Lieutenant General of tlie armies of his Majesty in America; Colonel of 
the Queen s regiment of Light Dragoons ; Governor of Fort William 
in North Britain; Member of the Lower House of Great Britain; 
Commander of an army and a fleet on the Expedition from Canada, 
etc., etc. 

The troops intrusted to my command are designed to act in union 
and complete accord with the numerous armies and fleets which have 
already disseminated, in every part of America, the power, the justice and when properly solicited the mercy of the king. 

The cause for which British arms are now so actively engaged, 
is of the deepest interest to the human heart ; and the troops of the 
crown, at first called together for the sole purpose of preserving 
intact the rights of the constitution, now unite to the love of their 
country and their duty to their ruler, those broad principles which 
spring from a proper appreciation of the rights of man. The sad 
question appeals directly to the eyes and ears of the moderate portion 
of the people, and the hearts of the thousands who suffer in the 
provinces, viz : Has not the present unnatural revolt been made the 
foundation of a complete system of tyranny, which God, in his dis 
pleasure, has always allowed to be exercised for a time, on a self-willed 
and stubborn generation ? 



292 OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS RELATING 

Self-chosen incarceration, confiscation of property, persecution and 
martyrdom, such as has not been experienced in the inquisition of the 
Romish church, arc a part of the open outrages which confirm the 
truth of this statement. All these are practiced on the subjects by con 
ventions and committees (who dare to call themselves the " friends 
of liberty," ) without regard to age or sex, not on account of crime, but 
because they are suspected of loyalty to the government under w T hich 
they were born, and to which they owe allegiance by every tie of God 
and man. And to crown this outrageous conduct, the desecration of 
religion is added to the most wicked abuse of a sound human intellect. 
The conscience of man is considered of no account ; and the masses 
are forced not only to take up arms, but to swear allegiance. 

In consideration of this, at the head of troops who are in full 
health, discipline and bravery, resolved to punish when necessary, 
and to spare when it is possible, I call upon and exhort all persons, 
wherever my army goes and with God s blessing, it will go a great 
ways to manifest such conduct as shall justify me in sparing their 
lands, their houses, and their families. The object of this address is 
not to bring rapine upon this land, but to offer it protection. 

To those who, by courage and bravery, feel themselves called upon 
to participate in the glorious work of liberating their country from 
bondage, and of recovering the blessings of a moderate government, 
I offer encouragement and employment, and will find the means of 
supporting their actions as soon as intelligence of their having united 
themselves to us has reached me. The diligent, the sturdy, the 
weak, and even the timid, I desire to aid, providing they remain 
quietly in their homes, do not drive away their cattle, hide or destroy 
their grain or feed, do not destroy the bridges nor the roads, nor, by 
other actions, directly or indirectly, impede the movements of the 
royal troops, or seek to support or help those of the enemy. 

All kinds of provisions, that may be brought into my camp, shall 
be paid for in cash at a reasonable rate, and in good coin. 

Considerations of Christianity, the mercy of my royal master, and 
the honor of the military calling, have caused me to lengthen this 
address, and I only wish that I possessed more forcible language to 
give it greater weight. May the people to whom it is addressed 
not reject it on account of the distance of my camp. I have but 
to let loose the Indians under my command (who number thousands) 
to reach the foes of Great Britain and America, wherever they may 
be concealed, for 1 consider them one and the same. 

If, in spite of these exertions, and honest endeavors to carry them 
out, the madness of hostility should still continue, then I hope to 
stand justified in the sight of God and man in pronouncing and exe-

cuting the vengeance of the state on the stubborn reprobates. The 
messengers of justice and anger expect them on the battle-field ; while 
desolation, famine, and all the terrors connected with it, must be their 
portion, which, although it may come slowly, in the unavoidable 
execution of military duty, must inevitably cut off the way for their 
return. 1

DESCRIPTION OF TICONDEROGA AND THE FORTS SOUTH OF IT AT 
THE TIME OF THEIR OCCUPATION BY THE AMERICANS IN THE 
YEAR 1777. 2 

[From the Journal.] 

The following items, which could not be added to the diary, 
when it was sent to Germany, will show the condition of Ticonde- 
roga, and the other forts previous to the commencement of this 
year s campaign. They are taken from the memorials of Major 
Kingston, adjutant general of General Burgoync, and extends to 
May 13th, 1776. 

I. Fort Carillon. 

In this are eight eighteen-pounder guns in double fortified works. 
It is surrounded on the north side by palisades in front of, and sur 
rounding which is an abatis. Between this fort and the old French 
redoubt a new log-house (block house) has been built. 

II. The old French IMoubf, 

This is about two hundred rods east of the fort, and is mounted 
with six cannons, four of which are nine-pounders and two twelve- 
pounders. This redoubt has been repaired (its old shape being pre 
served), and is also surrounded by an abatis. 

III. The old French lines. 

These have lately been somewhat repaired, but are not mounted. 
The palisades have also not been repaired. 

IV. The Five Redoubts near the shore. 

These are situated in a northeasterly direction from the fort at the 
foot of a hill. They have not been repaired. 

N.B. On the 13th of May, the news reached us, that the rebels 
were about repairing, and placing cannons upon them, but as yet, it 
is unknown of what calibre they are to be. It has been said, however, 
that they may be two eighteen-pounders and a few twelve-pounders 
that are expected about October. 

All these redoubts, as well as the lines, are poorly manned. 

V. Fort (Mount) Independence. 

(a.) North of the mountain is a strong abatis where twelve 
cannons are posted ; one of which is a thirty-two-pounder, and the 
rest are eighteen and twelve-pounders. All of the works are 
surrounded by a strong abatis. 

(b.) One hundred yards from the works are smaller fortifications, in 
which three eighteen-pounders and three twenty-four-pounders are 
placed. 

(c.) South of these works are barracks and palisades ; and in front 
of them is another abatis. In the rear of the former are eight nine- 
pounders. Besides these, there are twelve more nine and twelve; 
pounders, designed for the defense of the barracks. These, however, 
are not yet mounted. 

N.B. According to late news, twenty cannons have been taken to 
a battery, in a northerly direction, at the foot of the fort, with a view 
of commanding the lake. These are twelve-and eighteen-pounders. 

(d.} There are a few cannons on the half-moon battery, which defend 
en barbette. 

(e.) There are about one hundred iron cannons on the ships near 
Carillon ; but there are no mortars whatever. These iron cannons 
are mostly old ones. 

Particulars. 

The number of troops, at present in Carillon and near Mount 
Independence, does not exceed 1,300 men; but reenforcements 
amounting to fifteen regiments, are hourly expected. There is 
an abundance of provisions. No preparations have been made 
to build new ships. The vessels of the enemy consist of a rowing vessel, an old sloop, and two two-masters. The troops from New 
England arrive daily in front of No. 4. 

KB. Intelligence, as late as May 13th, states, that there are at 
Ticondcroga (including the laborers), 2,800 men. Their chief business at that time consisted in cantooning and in constructing a 
bridge, the foundation of which was laid in the winter by the rebels. 
This foundation consists of between forty and fifty sunken boxes, 
filled with stones, and laid at a distance of fifty feet from each other. 
It is thought, that this bridge cannot be finished even in two 
months, from the 14th of May. It is to serve as a connection 
between Mount Independence and Fort Carrillon, and is to cover the 
retreat in case one of those posts should be captured. The turnpikes 
are north of the bridge, but the ships south, in order to defend it. 
Close behind this bridge is another and smaller one, which is only 
five feet in width. It is designed for pedestrians, and is between the 
store houses and Mount Independence. 

The rebels have lately received 150 tons of powder. This has 
been the whole supply the entire winter. They have also received 
four four-pounders, which were made at Cambridge, near Boston. A 
great supply of muskets has, likewise, arrived from the West India 
islands. A French engineer officer has lately reached the rebel 
army, and was appointed engineer-in -chief. 1 

Fort Skenesborough. 

The garrison here consists of about 80 men. No preparations, 
whatever, have been made at this post for ship-building. There are 
barracks here, surrounded by palisades, in which provisions and a 
large quantity of war material are stored. 

Fort Anne. 

Is garrisoned by about thirty men, and has a barrack with palisades. 

Fort George? 

1st. The citadel has only recently been repaired and provided with 
two nine-pounders. It contains, also, twelve cannons, which are not 
yet mounted. Barracks for 1,000 men lie twenty yards east of it. 

3d. Close to the shore is a large magazine in which there is an 
abundance of provisions. 

3d. To the west of this magazine, where Fort William Henry 
formerly stood, is the large hospital, a building of great dimensions, 
and used for the sick from Fort Carrillon. This is said to be sur 
rounded by palisades, and to have a small redoubt on the hill south 
of it. 1 A strong guard is posted here every night. The rebels at 
Fort George are very busy in cutting down trees and carrying them 
to the shore to be used in the construction of six strong vessels on the 
lake. A so-called Commodore Wynkoop, is said to be still in com 
mand at this post ; only one regiment, it is further said, remains here 
during summer ; but as yet there are only 400 men there. There is 
also considerable scarcity in ammunition.

LETTER FROM A BRUNSWICK OFFICER TO A FRIEND IN BRUNSWICK ILLUSTRATING AFFAIRS IN CANADA AT THAT TIME. 

QUEBEC, October 27, 1776. 

This will probably be the last letter that I will be able to send you 
during this year. Lieut. Haynes, formerly the agent of our squadron, 
is kind enough to carry it with him to London, to which place he 
will sail to-morrow in the Pallas all of the ships leaving here at that 
time to avoid being blocked up the ice. I hope that all of my letters 
have safely reached you, though I have not received a single answer 
to any of them. We are all, however, in the same fix, and no one can 
explain the reason, when so many ships are constantly arriving. 

The army is going into winter quarters. We will be quartered 
between Trois Rivieres and Chambly. Major General Riedesel takes 
quarters in Trois Rivieres, and Colonel Specht in Chambly. We are 
furnished for winter with long pants, gloves and overcoats, and I 
guess, perhaps, that we are to have a winter campaign. I know the 
cost of such expeditions. 

You probably have learned from the newspapers of the great 
advantages gained by our armies. The lake 1 is free : Fort Frederick 
is in our possession; and the flotilla of the rebels is ruined, with very 
little loss on our side. The Brunswick troops have not been engaged ; 
consequently there is no loss and no advancement to be hoped for. 
We receive no newspapers from Europe ; and as our letters also fail 
to arrive, we are all in the dark respecting the political situation. 
Please give us some light upon it, if possible. Rumors are current 
here of a war between Spain and Portugal, but they are only rumors. 

Thus we march further up into the country. But you may ask, 
what say the belles of Quebec to it? My dear friend, this goes to 
my heart, and I must say I dread the departure ! How many parties 
have been arranged, but are now to be given up ! Nevertheless, the 
order for a march at once, transforms the heart of a soldier into stone, 
and hardens it like steel. Instead of the fair sex, we must now 
hunt the bear, the moose and the caribou ! The one is in direct 
opposition to the other, but what can a poor fellow do ! Fiat wluntas 
Domini is the motto of a soldier. 

We have to make the march on land, which will not be very 
pleasing. The weather begins to be rough ; the roads are shocking, 
and our winter equipment is not wholly completed. 

I have not heard lately from Anton, but trust he is well. His 
regiment is still encamped near Chambly. 

Our fare, during the winter, will probably consist of salt pork, and 
beef, and crackers. At least, this is the supposition, as fresh meat 
and vegetables are really very scarce. Vegetables are not much 
cultivated here, at least not in such quantities as to supply the 
number of men, at present in this province. The many wars have 
pulled heavily upon Canada, though it has never been more pro 
sperous than when under the English rule. During the last fifteen 
years, more than half of the country has been placed in a partial 
state of cultivation, and the number of the inhabitants has increased 
one-third. Compared with the age of men, Canada is now a boy of 
eleven or twelve years. 

I must close, as a messenger has just called for this letter. The 
ship is weighing anchor, and is about to sail. 

Good bye, be happy and merry. My best compliments to all. 

Ever Yours, 

AUGUST.

BROOKLYN, September 27, 1866. 
WM. L. STONE, Esq. 

My Dear Sir : The following narrative was communicated to me 
in 1828, by Mr. Stafford of Albany, the son of an American captain, 
who was in the battle of Bennington. I send you herewith my 
original notes of the conversation, taken down at the time from the 
lips of the narrator, which you may cheerfully make use of (if you so 
desire), in your forthcoming translation. 

Respectfully yours, 

THEODORE DWIGHT. 

My father lived in the western part of Massachusetts, and when 
Colonel Warner called upon the militia to come out and defend the 
public stores at Benningtou, he set off at once with many of his 
neighbors, and hurried his march. He was well known to his towns 
men ; and so much esteemed, that the best men were ready to go with 
him ; many of them pious people, long members of the church, and 
among them young and old, and of different conditions. 

When they reached the ground, they found the Hessians posted 
in a line ; and on a spot of high ground, a small redoubt was seen 



300 OFFICIAL D CUMENTS BEL A TING 

formed of earth just thrown up, where they understood a body of 
loyalists or provincial troops, that is, tories, was stationed. Colonel 
Warner had command under General Stark ; and it is generally thought 
that he had more to do than his superior in the business of the day. 
He was held in high regard by the Massachusetts people ; and my 
father soon reported himself to him, and told him he awaited his 
orders. He was soon assigned a place in the line, and the tory fort 
was pointed out as his particular object of attack. 

When making arrangements to march out his men, my father 
turned to a tall, athletic man, one of the most vigorous of the band, 
and rather remarkable for size and strength among his neighbors. 
" I am glad," said he, " to see you among us. You did not march 
with the company ; but, I suppose, you are anxious for the business of 
the day to begin." This was said in the hearing of the rest, and 
attracted their attention. My father was surprised and mortified, on 
observing the man s face turn pale, and his limbs tremble. With a 
faltering voice, he replied: "Oh no, sir, I didn t come to fight, I 
only came to drive back the horses ! " "I am glad," said my father, 
" to find out we have a coward among us, before we go into battle. 
Stand back, and do not show yourself here any longer." 

This occurrence gave my father great regret, and he repented having 
spoken to the man in the presence of his company. The country 
you know, was at that time in a very critical state. General 
Burgoyne had come down from Canada with an army, which had 
driven all the American troops before it ; Crown point and Ticonde- 
roga, the fortresses of Lake Champlain, in- which the northern people 
placed such confidence, had been des.erted at his approach ; and the 
army had disgraced itself by a panic retreat, without fighting a 
battle, while Burgoyne was publishing boastful and threatening 
proclamations, which frightened many, and induced some to declare 
for the king. Just at such a time, when so many bad examples 
were set, and there were so many dangers to drive others to follow, 
it was a sad thing to see a hale, hearty, tall man shake and tremble 
in the presence of the enemy, as we were just going to fight them. 
However, an occurrence happened, fortunately, to take place immediately after, which made amends. There was an aged and excellent 
old man present, of a slender frame, stooping a little with advanced 
age and hard work, with a wrinkled face, and well known as one of 
the oldest persons in our town, and the oldest on the ground. My 
father was struck with regard for his aged frame, and, much as he felt 
numbers to be desirable in the impending struggle, he felt a great 
reluctance at the thought of leading him into it. He therefore turned 
to him, and said : " The labors of the day threaten to be severe, it is 
therefore my particular request, that you will take your post as 
sentinel yonder, and keep charge of the baggage." The old man 
stepped forward witli an unexpected spring, his face was lighted up 
with a smile, and pulling off his hat, in the excitement of his spirit, 
half affecting the gayety of a youth, while his loose hair shone as 
white as silver, he briskly replied: "Not till I ve had a shot at 
them first, captain, if you please." All thoughts were now directed 
towards the enemy s line ; and the company, partaking in the enthu 
siasm of the old man, gave three cheers. My father was set at ease 
again in a moment ; and orders being soon brought to advance, he 
placed himself at their head, and gave the word: "Forward, 
march ! " 

He had observed some irregularity in the ground before them, 
which he had thought might favor his approach ; and he soon dis 
covered that a small ravine, which they soon entered, would cover 
his determined little band from the shot of the enemy, and even from 
their observation, at least for some distance. He pursued its course ; 
but was so far disappointed in his expectations, that, instead of termi 
nating at a distance from the enemy s line, on emerging from it, and 
looking about to see where he was, he found the fresh embankment 
of the tory fort just above him, and the heads of the tories peeping 
over, with their guns leveled at him. Turning to call on his men, he 
was surprised to find himself flat on the ground without knowing why ; 
for the enemy had fired, and a ball had gone through his foot into 
the ground, cutting some of the sinews just as he was stepping on it, 
so as to bring him down. At the same time, the shock had deafened 
him to the report of the muskets. 

The foremost of his soldiers ran up and stooped to take him in their 
arms, believing him to be dead or mortally wounded ; but he was 
too quick for them, and sprang on his feet, glad to find he was not seri 
ously hurt, and was able to stand. He feared that his fall might check 
his followers ; and, as he caught a glimpse of a man in a red coat run 
ning across a distant field, he cried out, " Come on, my boys ! They 
run ! They run ! " So saying, he sprang up, and clambering to the top 
of the fort, while the enemy were hurrying their powder into the pans 
and the muzzles of their pieces, his men rushed on shouting and firing, 
and jumping over the breastwork, and pushing upon the defenders 
so closely, that they threw themselves over the opposite wall, and ran 
down the hill as fast as their legs would carry them. 

Those raw soldiers, as most of them were, were ready to laugh at 
themselves, when they turned round and saw themselves, their new 
position, masters of a little fort which their enemies had been hard at 
work to construct, they knew not how long ; but out of which they 
had so easily been set a scampering, merely because they had shown 
some resolution and haste in assaulting it. 

The result of the day s battle is well known. The Hessians and 
other troops with them, suffered a total defeat; and not only were 
the stores at Bennington protected and saved, and the army of Bur- 
goyne weakened by the loss of a considerable body of troops, but the 
spirits of the people greatly encouraged, and the hope of final success 
revived. From that time there was less difficulty found in collecting 
troops ; and the recruiting of our army at Bcmis s Heights, or Sara 
toga, as it is often called, was more easily effected. 

It so happened that many years after the close of the war, and 
when I had heard my father tell this story many times over, I 
became acquainted with an old townsman of his, who was a loyalist, 
and took an active part as a soldier in the service of King George ; 
and he told me a story of the battle of Bennington which I think you 
would like to hear. 

Story told by one who was in the Tory Fort. 

I lived not far from the western borders of Massachusetts when the 
war began, and knew your father very well. Believing that I owed 
duty to my king, I became known as a loyalist, or, as they called rne, 
a tory ; and soon found my situation rather unpleasant. I therefore 
left home, and soon got among the British troops who were coming 
down with Burgoyne, to restore the country to peace, as I thought. 
When the Hessians were sent to take the military stores at Benning 
ton, I went with them ; and took my station with some of the other 
loyalists in a redoubt or small fort in the line. We were all ready 
when we saw the rebels coming to attack us ; and were on such a 
hill and behind such a high bank, that we felt perfectly safe, and 
thought we could kill any body of troops they would send against 
us, before they could reach the place we stood upon. We had not 
expected, however, that they would approach us under cover ; but 
supposed we should see them on the way. We did not know that 
a little gully which lay below us, was long and deep enough to con 
ceal them ; but they knew the ground, and the first we saw of the 
party coming to attack us, they made their appearance right under our 
guns. Your father was at the head of them. I was standing at the 
wall at the time, with my gun loaded in my hand ; and several of us 
leveled our pieces at once. I took as fair aim at them as I ever did 
at a bird in my life, and thought I was sure of them ; though we had 
to point so much downwards, that it made a man but a small mark. 
We fired together, and he fell. I thought he was dead to a certainty ; 
but to our surprise he was on his feet again in an instant, and they all 
sprang right up the bank so that they did not give us time to load, and 
came jumping into the midst of us, with such a noise, that we thought of 
nothing but getting out of the way of their muskets as fast as possible. 
I saw all my companions were going over the wall on the other side, and 
I went too. We had open fields before us, and scattered in all direc 
tions, some followed by our enemies. I ran some distance with 
another man, and looking around saw several of your father s soldiers 
who were coming after us, level their muskets to fire. We had 
just reached a rail fence, and both of us gave a jump at the same 
instant to go over it. While I was in the air I heard the guns go off. 
We reached the ground together, but my companion fell and lay 
dead by the fence, while I ran on with all my might, finding I was 
not hurt. 

I looked back, hoping to see no one following me ; but I was 
frightened on discovering a tall, rawboned fellow, running like a deer, 
only a short distance behind, and gaining on me every step he took. 
I immediately reflected that my gun was only a useless burthen, for 
it was discharged, and had no bayonet; and, although a valuable 
one, I thought my only chance of saving my life, lay in lightening 
myself as much as possible. I therefore gave my gun a throw off to 
one side, so that if my pursuer should choose to pick it up he should 
lose some distance by it; and then without slackening my speed, 
I turned my head to see how he took the manoeuvre ; and found 
he had not only taken advantage of my hint, and thrown away his 
own gun, but was also just kicking off his shoes. I tried to throw 
off my own in the same way, but they were fastened on with a pair 
of old fashioned silver buckles. I strained myself to the utmost to 
reach a wood which lay a little way before me, with the desperate hope 
of finding some way of losing myself in it, I ventured one look 
more ; and was frightened almost out of my senses at finding the 
bare-legged fellow almost upon me, and ready to gripe, and perhaps 
strangle me by main force. I did not like to stop and give myself up 
as a prisoner ; for I supposed he must be in a terrible passion, or he 
would not have taken such extraordinary pains to overtake me ; and 
even if he should spare my life and do me no injury, in that solitary 
spot, I did not know what to expect from the rebels, as we called 
them. So I ran on, though but an instant more ; for I had hardly 
turned my head again before I found the appearance of a wood 
which I had seen was only the tops of some trees growing on the 
borders of Wallamsack creek, which ran at the foot of a frightful 
precipice, the edge o f which I had reached. I felt as if it were almost 
certain death to go farther ; but I had such a dread of my pursuer, 
that I set but lightly by my danger, and instead of stopping on the 
brink, I ran right off, without waiting even to see where I was 
going. 

I fell like a stone, and the next instant struck on my feet in 
soft mud, with a loud, spatting noise, which I heard repeated 
close by me : Spat ! spat ! for down came the fierce fellow after 
me, and struck close by me in the wet clay, by the edge of the 
water. I looked at him with perfect dismay ; for what could I 
do then? I had sunk into the mud up to my knees, and was 
entirely unarmed. It was some relief to see, that he had no pistol 
to shoot me, and was not quite near enough to reach me. He, 
however, was beginning to struggle to get his legs out, and I expected 
to see him free and springing upon me in a moment more. I 
struggled too, but found it was no easy work to extricate myself, and 
began to think, that it would probably be as bad for him. This 
encouraged me to try with all my might ; and I thought I found my 
neighbor was much slower in getting out than I had feared. Indeed 
I could not perceive, for some time, that either of us made any 
advances, although we had wasted almost all our remaining strength. 
I now remarked, that niy enemy was standing much deeper in the 
mud than myself. Oh, thought I, the fellow was barefooted ; that is 
the reason : the soles of my shoes had prevented me from sinking quite 
so deep ; there is a good chance of my getting out before him. 
Still neither of us spoke a word. So I struggled again most violently; 
but the straps of my shoes were bound tight across my ancles, and 
held them to my feet, while I felt that I had not strength enough to 
draw them out. This made me desperate ; and I made another effort, 
when the straps gave way, and I easily drew out one bare foot, and 
placed it on the top of the ground. With the greatest satisfaction 
I found the other slipping smoothly up through the clay; and, 
without \vaiting to regret my shoe buckles (which were of solid 
silver), or to exchange a blow or a word with my enemy, whom I was 
still dreadfully afraid of, I ran down the shore of the brook, as fast as 
my legs could carry me. 

A man, who has never been frightened as I was, with the expectation of instant death, cannot easily imagine how far he will run, or 
how much he can do, to get out of danger. I thought for some time, 
that my long-legged enemy was coming, and ran on, afraid almost 
to look behind me. But he did not come ; and I never saw or heard 
of him again. How he could have got out, I cannot imagine; and 
there seemed to be no chance of his finding help very soon, so that 
I think he must have spent the night in that uncomfortable condi 
tion, and may have stayed, for aught I know, till he starved to death. 

However, my fears were not dispelled; for I knew our whole 
detachment had been entirely routed : Germans, Englishmen, tories, 
and all ; and, as I thought there would be a pursuit by our conquerors, 
I expected every moment to meet some of them, with arms in their 
hands. Indeed, at any moment I might be discovered by some of 
them, and fired upon before I could see them ; so I chose the most 
secret paths and courses I could find, keeping among the thickest 
trees and bushes, and avoiding every house and sign of inhabitants, 
under a constant fear of being dead or a prisoner the next moment. 
Who can tell what I suffered in that one day ? I had been delivered 
from the imminent danger of musket balls, bayonets, the close pursuit 
of a rancorous enemy, a leap from a precipice and a long and most 
fatiguing run through a wild and unknown region, traversed, as 
I presumed, by many men thirsting for my blood. Night was now 
approaching, and I felt almost faint with the want of food as well 
as weariness. But I soon reached a region which I began to 
recognize as one I had before seen ; and, knowing that the house 
of my brother-in-law was not far distant, I determined to visit it, 
and get such food and clothes as I now greatly needed. On second 
thoughts I concluded that I might be in danger even there. There 
might be a party of my enemies in the neighborhood, if not in 
possession of the house ; for in such times, in a region overrun by 
war, one party often occupies a position one day or one hour which 
they give up to their enemies the next. I therefore determined to 
proceed with great caution ; and, although I soon came in eight of 
the house, and was suffering greatly from the want of rest and 
refreshment, I concealed myself, and watched the neighborhood as 
long as I could see, and then, after remaining quiet till late in the 
night, stole out softly, and walked round the house, listening care 
fully, and scrutinizing everything, to discover traces of any change 
unfavorable to my wishes. 

Finding no sign of danger, I at length mustered up courage and 
entered the house, where I found the family had not all retired to 
rest ; and was very glad to see my sister coming towards me with an air 
of unconcern, which showed the household had not been disturbed. 
When she approached me, however, she addressed me as a stranger ; 
and then, for the first time, I began to think of my appearance. 
There had been powder enough burnt in the fort to blacken my 
face as dark as an Indian s, and the perspiration which had started out 
during my races had washed it partly off in streaks, so that the 
expression of my countenance was strangely altered. At the same 
time I was without a coat, and my few remaining garments were 
torn by thorns and spattered with mud. 

I was treated with the utmost kindness by my sister as soon as she 
recognized me; and, after eating a good meal, and taking a long 
night s rest, I felt quite well and strong. She kept me as long as I 
was willing to stay ; but I did not feel safe out of the army, which 
then seemed sure of soon reaching Albany and finishing the war. 
I soon set off on foot, reached Burgoyne s lines, and was placed in 
the tory fort on the eastern brow of Bemis s heights. There I 
thought myself safe once more. The abatis, formed of rough trees, 
with their branches on, which had been laid on the sides of the fort, 
appeared absolutely impassable by any body of the enemy. But in 
this I was disappointed; for, when the battle came on, the Yankees 
rushed upon our fortification with impetuosity, and in such numbers 
that they soon covered the ground and trees, that they were as thick 
as the hair on a dog. Again I was glad to save myself by a rapid 
retreat.
