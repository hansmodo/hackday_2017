PREFACE. 



THERE are three sources to which the writer of bio- 
graphy may repair, for materials to accomplish his 
work. The first is an intimate personal acquaintance 
with his subject, derived from long intercourse, and a 
daily participation in the scenes which it is his purpose 
to describe. The next is, a detailed narrative of inci- 
dents and events, taken down from the lips of his 
subject, giving to his delineations the spirit and au- 
thenticity of an autobiography. The third is found in 
the testimony of neighbors and acquaintances, corrobo- 
rated by contemporaneous history, correspondence, 
&c. When the veracity and honesty of the party are 
unimpeachable, there is no source so reliable as that 
which is here placed second in the list. No person 
can possibly be so well acquainted with the acts of 
another as himself. And when, to the proper appre- 
ciation of these acts, it is necessary to know some- 
thing of the motives and purposes from which they 
sprung, and the feelings with which they were accom- 
panied, this is the only source to which we can look. 
And when to -this is added an intimate personal ac- 
quaintance of a compiler of approved integrity and 
faithfulness, it affords the highest species of evidence 
in favor of his narrative, which can possibly be desired. 
Of this nature is the evidence in favor of the prin- 



PREFACE. 



cipal incidents in the life of General Putnam. His 
original biographer, Colonel David Humphreys, was 
intimately associated with him, having served as Aide- 
de-camp in his staff, during a portion of the Revolu- 
tionary War. He had many piru of the narrative 
direct from the lips of the General. That he was 
competent to discharge well the duties of a biographer 

that he was entitled to the confidence of his readers 

will not be questioned by any who have honestly 
consulted the history of the times, and weighed the 
opinions of those who knew him best. 

When General Putnam's health failed, in 1779, and 
he was compelled to retire from the service, Colonel 
Humphreys served, for a short time, as Aid to General 
Greene ; after which he became a member of General 
Washington's family, and served him as Aide-de-camp, 
during the remainder of his military career. That he 
occupied a very high place in the esteem of " the 
Father of his country," and of others eminent in the 
councils of the nation, is abundantly manifest in the 
correspondence of Washington. 

Among a multitude of letters which might be refer- 
red to, an extract from one only will be given. It 
"was addressed to Colonel Humphreys in Europe, un- 
der date of the 25th of July, 1785. General Wash- 
ington, apparently in reply to a suggestion from Hum- 
phreys, that he (Washington) should apply himself 
to preparing commentaries upon the Revolutionary 
War, says : " In a former letter, I informed you, my 
dear Humphreys, that if I had tiilents for it, I had no 
leisure to turn my thoughts to commentaries. * * * 
I should be pleased indeed to see you undertake this

business. Your abilities as a writer, your discernment 
respecting the principles which led to the decision by 
arms., your personal knowledge of many facts as they 
occurred in the progress of the war, your disposition 
to justice, candor , and impartiality, and your diligence 
in investigating truth) all combining, Jit you, when 
joined with the vigor of life, for this task. I should, 
with great pleasure, not only give you the perusal of 
all my papers, but any oral information of circum- 
stances, \vhich cannot be obtained from these, that my 
memory will furnish ; and I can "with great truth add, 
that my house would not only be at your service, dur- 
ing the period of your preparing this work, but ( I say 
it without an unmeaning compliment) I should be 
exceedingly happy if you would make it your home. 
You might have an apartment to yourself, in which 
you could command your own time. You would be 
considered and treated as one of the family, and meet 
with that cordial reception and entertainment, which 
are characteristic of the sincerest friendship." 

Colonel Humphreys returned home in May, 1786 ; 
after which he was often at Mount Vernon, a member 
of Washington's family. It was there that he wrote the 
Life of General Putnam, in 1788, under the eye of 
Washington, and with the best possible means of 
knowing that great man's opinion of the subject of 
his work. The work was written for the Society of 
Cincinnati, of Connecticut, and by them, and under 
their sanction, presented to the world. This Society 
was composed of surviving officers of the Revolution, 
the compeers of Putnam, and the sharers and eye- 
witnesses of his heroic and daring achievements.

PREFACE. 



In addition to the testimony of Colonel Humphreys, 
we have that of a large number of the cotemporaries 
of General Putnam. Numerous letters, written at the 
time when, and on the spot where, the several promi- 
nent events occurred, as well as the verbal testimony 
of the few aged witnesses who yet remain among us, 
confirm, and more than confirm, the narrative of his 
original biographer. It would appear that Putnam 
had not been disposed to estimate his own services 
very highly, or to present in any very strong colors 
his own acts of heroism ; since Colonel Humphreys, 
who gathered much of his material from personal con- 
versations with his subject, is far more modest and 
unpretending, in many of his statements, than authen- 
tic documents, furnished both by friends and by foes 
of that period, would warrant. 

In bestowing ^the above high commendation on 
Colonel Humphreys, it is not intended to hold him 
up as infallible ; but only to say, that, with respect to 
the general truthfulness and fidelity of his sketches, 
and the degree of reliance to be placed upon his narra- 
tive, though there may be some slight errors and mis- 
conceptions, the testimony is unquestionable, and the 
character of the witness above suspicion. 

The present compilation is, of course, indebted to 
the original memoir, for its main outline, and princi 
pal incidents. It will be seen, however, to have de- 
viated from it, in some points, upon a careful compa- 
rison of authorities ; while large additions have been 
made from other authentic sources. 

Brooklyn, L. /., Oct., 1846. 



IN the preparation of this work, the following authorities have been 
consulted. There are some discrepancies among them, in relation 
to several points of considerable importance. Without attempting to 
account for these discrepancies, I have endeavored as far as pos- 
sible to reconcile them, by a rigid and laborious comparison of 
each with all the rest, and by an impartial consideration of the 
amount of responsibility attached to each. How far I have succeed- 
ed in doing justice to all, and to my subject, it must be for others to 
decide.

AMONG the earliest settlers in Salem, in the Province of 
Massachusetts, was JOHN PUTNAM ; who, for the free 
enjoyment of the rights of conscience, and the liberty of 
worshipping God in the manner which his own judgment, 
enlightened by a careful study of the Scriptures, approved 
and required, left the home of his youth, and the sepul- 
chres of his fathers, and cast in his lot with the heroic, 
self-denying Pilgrims, under the banner of the venerable 
Endicot. He was a man of eminent piety, and acknow- 
ledged moral worth ; having blended in his character those 
elements of Christian heroism which distinguished our 
Pilgrim Fathers above every other body of men, that 
ever effected a great revolution in the world, and emi- 
nently fitted them, not .only to endure the hardships of a 
pioneer life in a savage wilderness, but to give substance 



22 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

and permanency to the new institutions, which it was 
their destiny to found in that wilderness. 

The original name of the family was Puttenham. They 
resided in Buckinghamshire, one of the southern counties 
of England, and out a short distance from the metropolis. 
The emigrant brought with him three sons, Thomas, Na- 
thaniel, and John, and two brothers, younger than himself. 
They pitched their tents, in 1634, in that remote part of 
Salem which, for a century past, has been included within 
the limits of Danvers, where they soon established them- 
selves as successful, independent farmers ; and where 
many of their posterity still reside, in circumstances of 
respectability and affluence. 

ISRAEL PUTNAM was the son of Captain Joseph Putnam, 
grandson of Thomas, and great grandson of the worthy 
John, who planted the family tree in this country. He 
was born on the seventh day of January, 1718, and was 
the eleventh of a family of twelve children. His mother's 
maiden name was Elizabeth Porter. The house in which 
he first saw the light is still standing, in good order and 
well-conditioned ; having, like the hardy old settlers who 
founded it, been built of the best materials which the 
times afforded. It is an old-fashioned, gambrel-roofed 
house, two stories in height, with dormer windows in the 
attic, and painted yellow. It is at present occupied by 
Mr. Daniel Putnam, grand nephew of the General. It 
stands on the main road from " The Plains," in Danvers, 
to Middletown, being the last house on the right before 
the intersection of that road with the Newburyport turn- 
pike. By the turnpike, it is exactly half way between 
Newburyport and Boston. 

A little above this house, near the an;le of a small hill, 

' O 7 

on the right side of the road, stands a locust tree, in a 
gentle hollow . On that spot formerly stood a small, one 



HIS EARLY LIFE. 23 

*tory house, which the General once occupied, and where 
ie kept a sort of bachelor's hall, previous to his marriage. 
When the house was taken down, some fifty years ago, 
.he locust tree was phinted there by one of the family, to 
designate the spot where it had stood. 

Of the early life of the General, however it might have 
been marked by incidents illustrating or foreshadowing 
those eminent traits of character which were developed 
oy the stirring scenes of his after years, we have no authen- 
tic records, and but few reliable traditions. To use the 
words of a kind correspondent, and a talented antiquarian 
of Salem,* to whom application was made for materials 
for this part of the memoir " Putnaip migrated from 
Massachusetts more than a century ago, while he was 
young and undistinguished. His neighbors and relatives 
were employed in rural pursuits, and while he dwelt with 
them they did not regard him as a future great man 
they noticed not ' the lambent flame on the crest of 
Tullius.' " 

The few incidents, relating to this period that have been 
preserved, are in perfect keeping with the character which 
he exhibited in after years. The same fearless daring, 
the same insensibility to danger, the same generous, manly 
disposition, and the same ready good humor, which made 
him through life the boon companion and the idol of his 
fri : nds,as well as the foremost leader in all kinds of adven- 
ture. Unfortunately, we have nothing of his school-boy 
days. Schools, especially in the scattered settlements of 
the country, were more rare at that period than now, and 
the advantages of education difficult to be obtained by 
those whose circumstances and mode of life, like those of 
our hero, demanded the unceasing application of their 
energies in cultivating the soil. The want of those advan-

tages, and of the benefits which he might have derived 
from them, was sensibly felt in all his subsequent career. 
And it is probable, had he been permitted, at the close of 
his life, to address the youth of the country, or to leave a 
legacy of caution and instruction to coming generations, 
he would have dwelt much and strongly upon the duty 
and privilege of a thorough early education. He would 
have urged the young to neglect no opportunity for acquir- 
ing knowledge, and preparing themselves, not only to win 
an honorable eminence in society, and adorn it when won, 
but to enjoy it with that conscious ease and self-reliance 
which, to an ingenuous mind, constitutes its principal 
attraction. 

There are few who have the native strength of character 
to rise above the inauspicious circumstances of early life, 
and carve out their own fortunes, by the mere dint of their 
own irrepressible genius. Putnam was one of the few. 
The times in which he lived demanded marked and strik- 
ing peculiarities in the class of men, whose duty it was to 
go forward and " guide the current of events." And it is 
one of the most interesting and instructive cases of the 
history of that exciting period, to notice how wonderfully 
its leading characters were fitted for the crisis, and how 
wisely and kindly the various " gifts " required for the 
service were distributed among them. 

That the heroic character of Putnam was inborn, a part 
of his very nature, and not the result of temporary excite- 
ment, or a transient exhiliration of spirits, will appear from 
the following anecdote, which is related of his bovish 
days. It exhibits a cool serenity and self-possession in 
times of great peril, which are of inestimable value to the 
leader of an enterprise, placing him, in a manner, above the 
vicissitudes of fortune, and making him the master, rather 
than the slave, of circumstance. The charge of crueltv, 



THE BIRD'S NEST, . 25 

which attaches to it, must be set down to the score of the 
heedlessness of youth ; for his whole subsequent life 
shows that he had a kind, generous, noble heart, keenly 
alive to the sufferings of others, and ready, almost to a 
fault, even to aid his enemies. Friends and foes alike 
accord him this praise. 

In common with most boys in the same situation in life, 
Putnam found great amusement in " bird's-nesting." Like 
many other boys, too, whose experience has not been 
written, he found it a very hazardous sport, having nearly 
lost his life in one of his hair-brained attempts to perpetrate 
this species of heartless piracy. It was customary, on 
these occasions, for several boys to go out in company ; 
but Putnam was always the leader of the band. In the 
case referred to, they had discovered a fine nest, lodged on 
a frail branch, near the top of a very high tree. The tree 
stood apart from others, and was difficult to climb. The 
nest was so far out of the way that it could not be reached 
by a pole, or any other contrivance, which they could 
command. The only possible way, therefore, to secure 
the prize, was for some one to venture upon one of those 
frail branches, neither of which, in the opinion of all the 
party, was sufficient to sustain the weight of any one of 
their number. 

Putnam regarded the nest and the limb in silence for 
some minutes. At length he said : 

" That bird has some of the qualities of a good soldier ; 
she has selected her post with excellent judgment, and 
fortified it with great skill. I'll wager there is not a boy 
within ten miles that can reach that nest." 

No one was disposed to accept the implied challenge. 
They were about quitting the spot in quest of some more 
practicable sport, when Putnam, deliberately taking ofFhis 
jacket, and rolling up his pantaloons to his knees, said, 

a 



26 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

" There's nothing like trying," and proceeded to climb the 
tree. 

His companions used their utmost eloquence to dissuade 
him from the mad attempt ; but all to no purpose. He 
never flinched from any undertaking when he had once 
made up his mind to it. The tree was ascended, and the 
limb gained, nearest to that which held the nest. It seemed 
stouter than the others. The daring boy placed his foot 
on it by way of trial. It creaked ominously ; while the 
mother-bird, with a shrill cry, abandoned her nest, hover- 
ing anxiously around, and uttering many a touching com- 
plaint. 

Stepping boldly out upon the limb, it bent under him. 
The boys below warned him of his danger, and entreated 
him not to venture any further. Getting down upon one 
knee, he reached toward the nest, but before he could 
grasp it the limb cracked. His comrades shouted to him 
to come down, but still he persevered. His fingers touched 
the wished-for prize. In his eagerness he cried, " I've got 
it it is mine." At that instant the limb broke quite off, 
and Putnam fell ; but not to the ground. His fall was 
arrested by one of the lower branches of the tree, which 
caught in his pantaloons, and held him suspended in mid 
air with his head downward. 

" Put, are you hurt ?" inquired one of the boys. 

" Not hurt," answered the undaunted heart, " but sorely 
puzzled how to get down." 

" We cannot cut away the limb for you because we 
have no knife." 

" You must contrive some other way to relieve me 
then, for I cannot stay here till you get one." 

" We will strike a light, and burn the tree down." 

" Ay ; and smo,ther me in the smoke. That will not 
do."

HIS COOLNESS AND INTREPIDITY. 27 

There was a boy named Randall in the group, who was 
noted for being a crack marksman, and who afterwards 
fought bravely at Putnam's side. Fortunately, he seldom 
went out without his rifle, and had it with him on this oc- 
casion. 

" Jim Randall," said he, " there's a ball in your rifle. * 

" Yes." 

" Do you see that small limb that holds me here ?" 

" I do." 

" Fire at it.'* 

" What ! to cut you down ?" 

" Of course ; for what else could I ask it." 

" But I might hit your head, perhaps." 

" Shoot ; better blow out my brains at once, than see me 
die here by hanging, which I shall certainly do in fifteen 
minutes. Shoot." 

u But you will fall." 

" Jim Randall, will you fire ?" 

Randall brought his rifle to his shoulder. Its sharp 
crack rang through the forest the splinters flew and 
Putnam fell to the ground. He was severely bruised by 
the fall. He laughed it off, however, and nothing more 
was thought of it. 

Not many days after, Putnam, who could never endure 
the thought of being defeated in an enterprise, returned 
alone to that tree, and succeeded, though with the greatest 
difficulty, in securing the nest, which he bore away in 
triumph to his companions. 

Though we cannot apologize for the cruel act of rob- 
bing a harmless bird of her home and her young, nor do 
otherwise than censure the fool-hardiness of the boy, who 
could twice put his life at hazard for such a prize, we can- 
not but see in this incident the germ of that indomitable 
spirit, which was so often displayed amid the more fearful 



28 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

perils of his subsequent career. His conduct, while sus- 
pended in the tree, displays the same coolness and self- 
possession, and the same promptness of action, which cha- 
racterized his daring leap at Horseneck, and his perilous 
trip down the rapids of the Hudson. 

As would naturally be expected from those traits of 
character which have already been exhibited, Putnam was 
eager to excel in all the manly athletic exercises, which 
constitute so large a part of the sports of a country village. 
In running, leaping, wrestling, pitching the bar, and in feats 
of horsemanship, he displayed great agility and physical 
power, and was scarcely ever second among his competi- 
tors. Even in the labors of the field and the wood, it 
was his early ambition to do the part of a man, and not to 
be outdone, even by his elders, in anything, which patient, 
persevering toil could achieve. 

But with all his restless activity, and his fondness for 
athletic amusements, he never loved a quarrel. He was 
not easily provoked. His disposition was frank, generous 
and confiding, and his uniform good humor often preserved 
the peace among his more inflammable companions, when, 
as is too often the case, the heat and excitement of their 
game began to wear a threatening aspect, and parties at 
play to assume the tone and bearing of combatants. His 
wit and humor gave him great influence on such occasions, 
and he always employed it in allaying excitement, and har- 
monizing and adjusting difficulties. It seems to have been 
his principle, that a man should never fight except with his 
enemy, and with him only when he could not manage him 
in any other way. 

On his first visit to Boston he was rudely assailed in the 
street by one of the young aristocrats of the town, who 
was considerably his superior both in age and size. The 
coarse homespun dress and awkward air of the country 



HIS FIRST FIGHT STORY OF CUDGE. 29 

boy, as he sauntered along, gazing into the shop-windows, 
and wondering at the number, size and magnificence of 
the buildings, excited the mirth of the well-dressed and 
self-important city boy, whose superior education did not re- 
strain him from showing his contempt in the most rude and 
ungentlemanly manner. His insults were borne in silence 
for a considerable time. At length, disgusted and exaspe- 
rated by this unprovoked and continued abuse, and rinding 
that it was attracting the attention of the people who were 
passing in the streets, he turned fiercely upon his assailant, 
and gave him so complete and satisfactory a drubbing, that 
he was glad to haul down his colors, and beat a retreat, 
much to the amusement of a large number of spectators, 
who made a ring to watch the issue of the contest. 

At that period there were slaves in all the colonies. It 
is true, they were not very numerous in New England. 
Still, slavery existed, and African bond-men, and bond- 
women, and bond-children, were found tell it not in 
Gath ! in all the towns, and scattered over the farming 
districts of Massachusetts. It fell to the lot of one of 
Putnam's neighbors to have one of these slaves in his 

O 

family, who was noted and feared for his fierce, ungoverna- 
ble temper, and a disposition that would have served a 
savage or a fiend. There seemed to be no way to subdue 
him but with the lash ; and that, though often repeated, 
was far from being as effectual as could have been wished. 

On one occasion, when Cudge had been particularly 
unruly, so that his master could do nothing with him, he 
called upon Putnam to assist him in administering the 
proper chastisement. 

" Well, neighbor, what do you propose to do ?" he 
inquired. 

" I intend to tie him up in the barn, and give him such 
a flogging as he will be likely to remember." 



30 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

" Very well," replied Putnam, " you catch him, and I 
will tie him up. You can then do what you please with 
him." 

Accordingly, the exasperated master went out into the 
field, seized Cudge, and brought him into the barn. Put- 
nam, in the mean time, had fastened his rope to a beam, 
and prepared a noose. Cudge resisted, and his master 
was obliged to exert all his strength to hold him. In this 
position, Putnam threw the noose over them both, so as 
completely to secure their arms, and render it impossible 
for them to help themselves, or each other, drew them up 
together, and left them to their reflections. 

Going coolly into the house, he lighted his pipe, sat 
down and smoked it out. Then, calling to the mistress of 
the house, he proposed to her to go out with him and see 
how the Captain and Cudge were getting along. 

Arrived at the barn, the good woman was almost thrown 
into hysterics, on seeing her husband bound up in this 
manner with that terrible negro, whom she feared scarcely 
less than she did a certain other character in black, whose 
name it would not be polite to mention, and of whom she 
regarded Cudge as the living representative, or counter- 
part, After a little persuasion, and some words of stronger 
import, Putnam unbound his prisoners, endeavoring to 
pacify the now doubly enraged master by assuring him, that, 
however disagreeable to himself, the effect upon Cudge 
would be better than a dozen floggings. 

The event justified the assertion. Cudge was so delight- 
ed with the joke, that he did not get out of humor for a 
long time after. At the same time, with that kind of 
instinctive regard which the slave naturally feels for his 
master, he could not help being hurt on his account. His 
heart was softened. He was more respectful and more 
obedient than he had ever been before. 



THE SLAVE DISPOSED OP. 31 

The sequel of Cudge's history is too good a story to be 
lost ; arid, though it has no relation to the subject of this 
memoir, we take leave to preserve it here, for the special 
benefit of those peculiar friends of Africa, who claim for 
New England an entire freedom from the plague-spot of 
slavery, and from any participation in " the price of 
blood." 

By some means, his mistress had grievously offended 
the negro. He became so enraged, that he swore he 
would take her life ; and neither soothing words, nor 
threats, had any effect to pacify him. The family was 
thrown into the greatest alarm, knowing that his temper 
was of that ungovernably savage character that nothing 
"would restrain him from indulging it. In this state of 
things, his master devised a plan for the permanent relief 
of his family. Having made his arrangements, he went 
out into the field with his hoe in his hand, and said 

" Cudge, you have had rather hot work getting in the 
potatoes." 

" Yes, massa, hot enough." 

" Well, I am going to give you a play-day. I have 
sold fifty bushels, to be delivered on board a vessel at the 
wharf in Salem, and if you would like it, you may go in 
with the load." 

" Oh ! yes, massa ; like it very well." 

" You may have the whole day, Cudge. You can 
take your fiddle with you, and play a jig for the sailors, 
and so get a few coppers for yourself. " 

Cudge was highly pleased with the proposal, and started 
off in great glee. 

Having unloaded his potatoes, the sailors, who had 
been let into the secret and received their instructions 
beforehand, called upon Cudge to bring out his fiddle and 



32 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

play them a jig, that they might have one merry dance 
before going to sea. 

The negro showed his teeth, and his fiddle too ; and 
presently the deck of the brig was as merry as a country 
ball-room at Thanksgiving. Meanwhile, the dancers were 
not niggardly in " paying the piper." The coppers fell 
on this side and that, and Cudge was somewhat discon- 
certed in his measure, by the necessity of breaking off and 
running after them, to prevent them from going out at the 
scuppers. Presently, one of the sailors said 

" Cudge, your fiddle is getting dry ; you must go be- 
low and rosin your bow." This was another phrase for 
" wetting his whistle," or taking a dram. 

Cudge took the hint with alacrity, and adjourned with 
two or three of the party to the forecastle. Here, with 
drinking, fiddling, singing and dancing, two or three hours 
passed away, and Cudge had almost filled his pockets 
with coppers. At length, starting up, as from a dream, he 
exclaimed : 

" Yah ! I must go up, and see how the cattle stand." 

He went up ; but, to his utter amazement, there was 
neither cattle nor cart to be seen ; no, nor houses, nor 
wharf. The brig was many miles out at sea, and Cudge 
was bound to a southern clime, where slaves could be 
more easily managed than on the hardy soil of New Eng- 
land. He went to the same market with his potatoes, 
and was sold for the samp account.

in the village Exaggerated versions of the story. 

IN 1739, at the age of twenty-one years, Mr. Putnam was 
married to Miss Hannah Pope, daughter of Mr. John Pope, 
of Salem, by whom he had ten children, four sons and six 
daughters. The following year he removed from his na- 
tive place, and settled upon a tract of land which he had 
purchased in Pomfret, in Connecticut. This is an inland 
town in Windham County, thirty-six miles east of Hart- 
ford, and situated on the Quinnebaug, or Mohegan river, 
one of the tributaries of the Thames. It is blessed with a 
good soil, and all the ordinary requisites for a thrifty and 
successful husbandry. 

In those days of comparative simplicity, the expenses 
of living, particularly in the farming districts, were very 
moderate, and easily acquired. Few of the costly luxu- 
ries of the present day were known. The hard and bur- 
densome yoke of European fashion, which grinds so many 
of us into the dust, was not then laid upon the colonies 



LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

It is a singular anomaly in the history of Independent 
America, that she wears, without complaint, the fetters of 
a voluntary slavery, ten times more expensive and burden- 
some than that which roused the dependent colonies to 
resistance, and severed for ever the bonds which had so 
long united them to the mother-country. Our good old 
fathers and mothers, particularly those who maintained the 
independent life of cultivators of the soil, would have 
scorned the servile imitation of the multitude in our day. 
They would have deemed it the extreme of folly to sacri- 
fice one real comfort to the mere outside show of equality 
to the rich and the great. 

With these simple, unaffected tastes, and no merely 
artificial wants to drain off all the fruits of their toil, the 
industrious and skilful were almost sure of success. This 
was the issue of Mr. Putnam's labors upon his new farm. 
A very few years found him in the enjoyment of a com- 
fortable and substantial home ; his clearings well fenced 
and cultivated ; his pastures handsomely stocked ; and his 
entire establishment, with one exception, in the full tide 
of prosperous increase. This exception, as it serves to 
illustrate the heroic and independent character of our sub- 
ject, and furnishes the explanation of one of the peculiar 
sobriquets, by which he was often distinguished among 
his military comrades in after life, deserves particular 
notice. 

Mr. Putnam's pastures were well adapted to the culti- 
vation of sheep. With his usual promptness he availed 
himself of this facility to carry on quite an extensive busi- 
ness in wool. His flocks were numerous and thrifty, and 
he prided himself not a little in having as extensive folds, 
and as good fleeces, as any in New England. He was, 
therefore, particularly nettled when this part of his exten- 
sive establishment was selected as the object of nightly 



THE WOLF. 

ravages, by some of the farmers' enemies, that were 
prowling about in that region. His fields had suffered 
occasionally from drought in summer, and mildew in har- 
vest. The severity of the winter had carried off some of 
his cattle. But these inroads upon his folds had.come to 
be exacted as an annual tribute, and were quite too severe 
to be tolerated. His losses were very great, so much se 
as to threaten the entire destruction of that department of 
his business. All this havoc appeared to have been com 
mitted by one she-wolf, and her annual whelps ; though 
it is not improbable they were sometimes accompanied by 
a stronger force. The young were usually destroyed in 
the course of the season by the vigilance of the hunters 
and their dogs ; but the old one was too sagacious to 
allow herself to be -caught, or even to be seen. She had 
once unwarily set her foot in a trap that was laid for her, 
but had escaped by leaving her toes behind. When too 
closely pursued to carry on her depredations any longer 
with safety, she would abandon the vicinity altogether for 
the season. But she invariably returned the ensuing 
winter, with another family of hungry whelps to feed. 

Mr. Putnam was not the only sufferer by these annual 
visits of the wolf. His neighbors, all around, shared in 
his losses, though none of them were quite as heavily 
taxed as he. At length, finding the nuisance intolerable, 
he entered into a combination with five of his neighbors to 
watch and hunt alternately, and never abandon the pursuit 
till she was destroyed. Two of them, by turns, were to 
keep on her track until she was overtaken, or driven home 
to her den. Commencing the pursuit immediately after a 
light fall of snow, in the opening of winter, they were soon 
on a trail that could not be mistaken. The accident of 
the steel trap had made one foot much shorter than its 
mate, so that the fugitive robber made her mark as she 



LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

went. In this manner she was pursued over hill and 
valley, through forest, and brake, and swamp, to the bank 
of the Connecticut river. Arrested in her flight here, she 
turnad back in a direct course for Pomfret, with the hunt- 
ers in close and vigilant chase. Early in the morning, 
the day after their return, they had driven her into a den, 
about three miles from the house of Mr. Putnam. Here 
she was carefully guarded, till a large company of men 
and boys had assembled, with dogs, guns, straw and sul- 
phur, prepared to finish the work which had been so well 
begun, by inflicting summary vengeance upon the common 
enemy. 

It was a scene of general interest and excitement. Rare 
sport was expected by some of the younger and less expe- 
rienced. It was soon found, however, that the enemy 
had chosen her retreat with good judgment ; and was pre- 
pared, not only to stand an obstinate siege, but to defend 
herself with a fierceness and bravery that were quite appal- 
ling. Some of the hounds, who had become heated in 
the chase, ventured into her fastness, but soon retreated, 
yelping bitterly and covered with wounds. And no ur- 
gency could induce them to return to the charge. 

It was now attempted to smoke her out. The mouth 
of the cave was filled with straw. The torch was applied. 
The smoke rolled up in heavy volumes, and filled every 
crevice of the cave ; but the wolf came not forth. She 
seemed resolved to die where she was, rather than suffer 
herself to be taken, or face the weapons of such a company 
of exasperated foes. The fumes of sulphur produced no 
better effect. It is probable, indeed, that the imprisoned 
animal was not so much annoyed by them as her tormen- 
tors supposed. There may have been some fissure by 
which they escaped, without finding their way into the 
inner recess of the cavern where the wolf was. 



HK ENTERS THE WOLf's DEN. 

In these -fruitless efforts to dislodge her, the time had 
flown by, till it now wanted only two hours of midnight. 
It was clear that something more effectual must be done, 
or all their labor would be lost. Another effort was made 
to induce the dogs to go in, but without success. They 
had had enough of that sport already, and would not budge 
an inch. Mr. Putnam then proposed to his servant to 
take a torch and a gun, and descend into the cavern and 
shoot the wolf. As his master doubtless expected, he 
declined the honor of so hazardous an enterprise. Find- 
ing no one in the company who was willing to attempt 
the perilous descent, and declaring he was ashamed to 
have a coward in his family, he resolved at once to go in 
himself, and put a certain end to the ravager of his flocks, 
lest she should escape by some unknown passage, and 
become once more the scourge of the country. 

His neighbors remonstrated against so mad an exposure 
of his life, but in vain. He was bent on accomplishing, 
that very night, the death of his victim. He knew that 
all wild animals have instinctive dread of fire. He, accord- 
ingly, provided himself with a quantity of birch-bark, 
which he tore into strips convenient for use these being 
the only torches which he could then command. Thus 
provided, he stripped off his coat and waistcoat, lighted 
one of his torches, and crawling on his hands and knees, 
without any weapon in his hand, commenced the bold 
descent. 

" The aperture of the den, on the east side of a very high 
ledge of rocks, is about two feet square ; from thence it 
descends obliquely fifteen feet ; then, running horizontally 
about ten feet more, it ascends gradually sixteen feet 
towards its termination. The sides of this subterranean 
cavity are composed of smooth and solid rocks, which 
seem to have been divided from each other by some for-

mer earthquake. The top and bottom are also of stone, 
and the entrance, in winter being covered with ice, is ex- 
ceedingly slippery. It is in no place high enough for a 
man to raise himself upright, nor in any place more than 
three feef in width. 

" Having groped his passage to the horizontal part of 
the den, the most terrifying darkness appeared in front of 
the dim circle of light afforded by his torch. It was silent 
as the house of death. None but monsters of the desert 
had ever before explored this solitary mansion of horror." 
It required no slight care and presence of mind, to keep 
alive the flame by which his course was guided. Though 
creeping on all fours, he was obliged several times to pause 
and renew his torch, at the imminent hazard, each time, of 
being left in utter darkness in the depths of the cave. 
" Cautiously proceeding onward, he came to the ascent, 
which he slowly mounted on his hands and knees, until he 
discovered the glaring eye-balls of the wolf, who was sit- 
ting at the extremity of the cavern. Startled at the sight 
of fire, she gnashed her teeth, and gave a sullen growl." 
Having fully reconnoitered the position of the enemy, and 
formed his plan of attack, the bold scout gave a hearty 
kick upon the rope, which, by way of precaution, had been 
secured around one of his legs. His friends, who were 
waiting in breathless suspense and anxiety at the mouth of 
the den, hearing the fierce growl of the wolf, which showed 
that she was yet unhurt, and supposing that Mr. Putnam 
must be in imminent danger, responded vigorously to the 
concerted signal, dragging him forth with such violence, 
*' that his shirt was stripped over his head, and his skin 
severely lacerated." 

Having adjusted his clothes, and loaded his gun, he took 
another handful of torches, and descended a second time 
into the narrow cave. Encumbered with his musket, this 



RETURNS IN TRIUMPH 39 

descent was much more difficult than the first, though, 
armed as he" was, and somewhat familiar with the bearings 
and distances of his journey, and the position of his foe, it 
was certainly much more safe and agreeable. As he ap- 
proached the object of his pursuit somewhat nearer than 
before, she manifested the most decided symptoms of un- 
easiness at his presence. Her appearance was exceedingly 
fierce and terrible ; " howling, rolling her eyes, snapping 
her teeth, and dropping her head between her legs, she 
was evidently in the attitude, and on the point, of springing 
at her assailant. At that critical moment he levelled his 
piece, aiming directly at her head, and fired. Stunned 
with the shock, and suffocated with the smoke of the pow- 
der, he immediately found himself drawn out of the cave," 
though somewhat more gently than on the former occa- 
sion. 

Having refreshed himself a few moments in the open 
air, and given time for the smoke to clear away from the 
long passages of the cavern, he went down the third time 
to secure and bring away his prize. His shot had taken 
good effect. The animal lay stretched on the floor of her 
inner chamber, weltering in her blood. Applying his 
torch to her nose, and finding her perfectly insensible, he 
seized her by the ears ; and, giving the usual signal to his 
friends without, by kicking the rope, was drawn heavily, 
but exultingly out, dragging his victim after him. 

On emerging into the air, and bringing out, amid the fit- 
ful glare of a score or two of torches, that fearful creature, 
that had so long been the terror and scourge of their fields, 
he was received with such a shout as made the old woods 
of Pomfret ring again. Its echoes reverberated along the 
valley, and reached the wakeful ears of the anxious wives 
and mothers, whose fears, increasing as the midnight hour 
approached, had led many of them more than once to ex- 



40 LIFE OF GENERAL P U T N A M . 

claim, " I wish they would leave the old wclf alone. I 
would rather lose every sheep in the fold, than have my 
husband or child brought home dead or wounded." 

The nature of that shout could not be mistaken, even by 
a woman. It hushed all their fears in a moment ; and 
when, some half an hour after, the party was seen winding 
down the valley, with flaming torches, escorting the victor 
in triumph to his home, with the trophy of his daring valor 
borne on a sort of litter on the shoulder of the larger boys, 
who claimed the honor as their perquisite for keeping 
awake so long the tables were all laid, and a generous 
hot supper provided for all the volunteers in that cold mid- 
night campaign. 

Mr. Putnam's frank, open, agreeable manners, his gene- 
rous spirit and uniform good humor, had already secured 
him the good will of all his neighbors ; while his activity, 
enterprise, good sense and sterling integrity of character had 
won for him their entire esteem and regard. He now be- 
came, as will naturally be supposed, the hero of the village 
and the surrounding country. The story of his daring ex- 
ploit with the wolf travelled far and wide, and received 
many poetical embellishments, in the course of its travels. 
In some cases the dimensions of the cave, and the difficulty 
of access to it, formidable as it really was, were greatly 
exaggerated. In some, the den was full of wolves, as 
that of Daniel was of lions ; while one version repre- 
sented the hero, like Samson or David, as entering her 
hold unarmed, seizing the wolf, and strangling her in his 
arms. Another substituted a bear and two cubs for the 
wolf, and represented the bear as going off with Putnam's 
sow in her mouth, \vhile he pursued her with a club, d.e- 
scending into the den, and destroying the whole family 
without the assistance of any other person. The story, 
with all its exaggerations, found its way into the papers 



THE UNRULY BULL. 41 

and journals of England and France, so that Putnam came 
to be familiarly known abroad as " the old wolf." This 
was a common designation among his fellow-officers during 
" the seven years' war." 

The description of the cave, given above, is in every 
particular accurate and exact, and was no doubt the result 
of actual measurement on the part of Colonel Humphreys 

Mr. Putnam was a man of great personal strength, as 
well as courage. His frame was large and athletic. His 
motions were rapid, nervous and impulsive. And though 
he seldom undertook what he did not successfully accom- 
plish, it often seemed as if he rushed to an act without 
thought, and achieved it without a purpose. The truth 
was, that the movements of his jnind were as nervous and 
impulsive as those of his body. His perceptions were 
quick and accurate, and he jumped to conclusions at which 
other men would arrive by slow and careful inquiry. This 
was the true secret of his successful daring. It was not 
thoughtlessness, but an instantaneous perception of all the 
bearings of his position, and a consequent calmness and 
self-possession which made him master of circumstances, 
over which other and less active minds would have had 
no control. 

An incident is related of him at this period, which, 
though it may seem too trifling of itself to be preserved, 
will illustrate this peculiar impulsiveness, at the same 
time that it affords a striking proof ot his uncommon 
strength. He had among his cattle a very fine bull, whom 
he valued highly for his noble proportions and great 
strength, but whose fierce, unruly temper made him the 
terror of the whole neighborhood. Corn'ttsj up to him in 
the pasture one day, when he had been peculiarly savage 
and ugly, he suddenly seized him by the tail and twisting 
it round a small tree, held him fast, while he administered 



42 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

a severe and effectual chastisement with an ox goad. 
The furious animal bellowed and tore the ground in his 
"rage, but it was of no avail. The rod was laid on with 
such determined energy and good will, that every stroke 
had its desired effect, while the strong arm that held him 
gave him no chance of escape. From that time he was 
master of the bull, and had only to show the rod in his 
hand, to make him comparatively quiet and submissive. 

The untiring industry and prudent husbandry of Mr. 
Putnam, during the ten or twelve years that intervened 
before the breaking out of the French War, placed his 
affairs on a very sound basis, and secured for him a com- 
fortable independence for life. And when he was after- 
wards called to engage in the active service of his country, 
in the camp and the field, and to undergo the hardships 
and privations of war, he had the satisfaction of leaving 
his family well provided for, and having a quiet retreat to 
fall back upon, whenever the fortunes of war should either 
compel or permit him to retire. In this respect, he was 
more favorably situated than many of his compeers, who, 
in hazarding their lives for a cause which was too poor 
to reward them for their services, sacrificed their all, and 
returned, when their liberties were achieved, to wear 
away the evening of their days amid the cares and priva- 
tions of poverty, as broken in fortune as in physical con- 
stitution. '

THE fearless courage, the generous and ready benevolence, 
and the open, frank, confiding manner of Mr. Putnam, won 
the admiration and regard of all who knew him. His 
early popularity was remarkable ; and so enduring was it, 
that the few individuals who have assumed the ungracious 
office of detracting from his well-earned fame, have been 
compelled to admit the fact, while they deny him every 
pretension to that distinguished merit on which it should 
have been founded. 

So great was his reputation, however accounted for, 
that, without any previous military experience, he was 
appointed to a captaincy, in the regiment of Connecticut 



44 LIFE OF GENERAL PUT N A II. 

provincials, on the breaking out of the French War. He 
found no difficulty in beating up recruits. His personal 
friends and admirers flocked to his standard, and his com- 
pany was soon complete. A company, not of vagabonds 
and bar-room adventurers, who follow the beat of a drum 
for the rations which it promises without the drudgery of 
daily toil but of hardy, industrious, respectable young 
men, the very flower of the yeomanry of Connecticut. 
None of them had been educated in the use of arms, or 
the evolutions of the camp and the battle-field. They had 
bold hearts and strong arms, and a confidence in their 
leader that made the service li^ht. 

O 

The regiment, of which this company composed a part, 
was commanded by General Lyman. Putnam's command, 
however, was so often detached on special and peculiar 
service, that it held, during all the war, rather the position 
of an independent corps, than that of a limb of the army. 
Though not specifically drafted as Rangers, nor organized 
under that distinctive name, the duty assigned to it, and 
performed by it, was of that hardy, bold, adventurous cha- 
racter, which is usually rendered by that portion of a well 
appointed army. It was a service to which the genius of 
Putnam was peculiarly adapted. He delighted in scenes 
of daring excitement. He revelled in adventure. The 
ordinary monotony of camp duty would have been insup- 
portably irksome. In the active and perilous duty of 
reconnoitering the enemy's posts, surprising their pickets, 
cutting off or capturing detached parties, waylaying eon- 
voys of provisions, destroying barracks and batteaux, and 
making prisoners, he found ample employment for his 
spirit of restless enterprise, as well as ample scope for that 
fruitfulness of invention and stratagem for which he was 
distinguished. 

Never, perhaps, was there a war between two civilized 



COMMENCEMENT OF THE FRENCH WAR. 45 

nations in which this peculiar kind of service was so indis- 
pensable, or where it was attended with so great and fear- 
ful hazards, as this, in which the English and French con- 
tended for the mastery in the Western Continent. The 
Indian tribes were nearly all enlisted on the side of the 
French. The mountains, the forests, the river banks, 
the shores and inlets of the lakes, were infested with 
straggling parties of these ruthless marauders, whose 
stealthy movements and peculiar mode of attack, rendered 
them far more formidable and annoying than many times 
their number of ordinary soldiers. Skulking in every 
thicket, and prowling in the outskirts of every wood, they 
were ever ready to spring upon the foe ; who oftener fell 
by an unseen hand, than by an open enemy, against whom 
they might defend themselves, either by skilful manoeuvre 
or the prowess of their arms. To contend with the diffi- 
culties of such a service, and render effective aid in its 
prosecution, the utmost coolness, prudence, sagacity and 
watchfulness, as well as fertility and readiness of resource, 
and promptness of action, were demanded. Bold, resolute, 
unflinching hearts, and hands that could almost anticipate 
the promptings of the will, were requisite to any degree 
of success. 

The war commenced in earnest in 1755, with the unfor- 
tunate expedition of General Braddock against Fort Du- 
quesne ; the fruitless one of General Shirley against Fort 
^Niagara ; and the brilliant victory of Sir William Johnson 
over the Baron Dieskau, at Fort Edward, on Lake George. 
It was in this last and successful expedition, that Captain 
Putnam entered upon that great theatre of honorable strife 
and hazardous adventure, where he won those enduring 
laurels, which link his name with the noblest and worthiest 
of our country. 

Ths object of this expedition was to reduce Crown 



46 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Point, and drive the French from their strong holds in and 
about Lake Champlain. It originated in Massachusetts, 
and was to be executed by the colonial troops of New 
England and New York, General William Johnson , a lead- 
ing member of the council of the latter colony, being placed 
in command. The troops from the different sections were to 
rendezvous at Albany. The greater part of them arrived 
at that place before the end of June ; but the artillery, 
bateaux, provisions, and other necessaries for the es pedi- 
tion could not be prepared till the 8th of August, at which 
time the army took up its line of march for the carrying 
place, between the Hudson and Lake George. General 
Lytnan was already there, and had commenced the erec- 
tion of a fortification, which was first called Fort Lyman, 
and afterward changed to Fort Edward. 

Toward the end of August, the main body moved for- 
ward, and encamped near the southern extremity of Lake 
George to which the French had given the name of Lake 
St. Sacrament. Here it was ascertained, by means of 
some Indian scouts, who had been sent out to gather intel- 
ligence, that a considerable party of French and Indians 
were stationed at Ticonderoga, on the isthmus between 
the north end of Lake George, and the southern part of 
Lake Champlain, about fifteen miles below Crown Point. 
Their position was admirably selected, as was proved in 
the subsequent history of the war, when it became a place 
of great strength and importance. But as yet, no defences 
were thrown up. Johnson was impatient to bring up his 
bateaux and artillery, intending to proceed wilh part of his 
force and seize that important pass. In the meantime, the 
French furnished him with sufficient employment at his 
own camp. 

Baron Dieskau was in command of the French forces. 
He had just received intelligence of the commencement of 



BATTLE OF LAKE GEORGE. 47 

the works at the carrying place by General Lyman, and 
resolved to give him battle before his entrenchments were 
completed ; intending, if successful, to desolate the north- 
ern settlements, lay Albany and Schenectady in ashes, and 
cut off all communications with Oswego^ and the northern 
lakes. With this design, he embarked at Crown Point 
with. two thousand men ; and, landing at South Bay, pro- 
ceeded toward Fort Edward. The troops were ignorant 
of his purpose of attack until they arrived within two miles 
of the fort. Then, finding the Canadians and Indians 
unwilling to face the English cannon, he suddenly changed 
his route, and moved rapidly northward, hoping to sur- 
prise the camp at St. Sacrament, or Lake George. 

In the meantime, General Johnson being apprised by 
his scouts of the movements of the French Baron sent 
messengers to Fort Edward to warn General Lyman of 
his approach. One of these was intercepted and killed. 
The others soon returned with the intelligence that they 
had descried the enemy about four miles northward of the 
fort. 

It was now the 8th of September. A council of war 
was immediately called, in which it was resolved to send 
out a detachment, to intercept the enemy on his return. 
Hendricks, the celebrated Mohawk chief, was present at 
this council. When the number proposed to be sent out 
was mentioned to him, he replied : " If they are to fight 
they are too few ; if they are to be killed they are too 
many" It was then suggested to send out a larger de- 
tachment, in three separate parties. Hendricks took three 
sticks, and said : " Put these together, and you cannot 
break them ; take them one by one, and you may do it 
easily." The Mohawk's advice was taken ; and victory, 
though dearly bought, was the result. 

The detachment was placed under the command of 



48 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Colonel Ephraim Williams, a brave officer, who, at the 
head of one thousand provincials, with about two hundred 
Indians, met the Baron nearly four miles from the camp. 
That able commander, apprised of their approach, made 
an advantageous disposition of his men to receive them. 
Keeping the main body of the regulars with him in the 
centre, he ordered the Canadians and Indians to advance 
on the right and left, in the woods, in such a manner as to 
enclose their enemy. When the American troops were 
considerably within the ambuscade, the old Mohawk 
sachem, who, with his Indians, had been sent out as a 
flank guard to the detachment, was hailed by a hostile 
Indian. 

" Whence came you ?" said he. 

" From the Mohawks. Whence came you ?" 

" From Montreal." 

The firing, which commenced immediately after this 
parley, brought on the action sooner than Dieskau intend- 
ed, and prevented Williams and his party from being 
entirely surrounded and cut off. The provincials fought 
bravely, but rinding themselves attacked on every side by 
superior numbers, were compelled to retreat with con- 
siderable loss. Colonel Williams was among the slain 
Hend ricks also was killed, with a number of his Indians, 
who fought with great intrepidity. The loss of the enemy 
was also considerable. Among their slain was M. St, 
Pierre, who commanded all the Indians, and on whom 
great reliance was placed. The retreating troops joined 
the main body, and waited the approach of their assail- 
ants, now rendered more sanguine and formidable by 
their recent success. 

A little before noon, the advanced guard of the enemy 
appeared in sight of the American army, which was 
encamped in a favorable position on the banks of Lake

George, covered on each flank by a low, thick wooded 
swamp. General Johnson had just mounted several 
pieces of cannon, which he had most opportunely received 
two days before from Fort Edward ; and trees had been 
felled to form a sort of breastwork, which was his only 
cover against an attack. 

The enemy marched along the road, in very regular 
order, and in high confidence of victory. When within 
one hundred and fifty yards of the breastwork they made 
a momentary halt. A spirited attack was then made by 
the regulars upon the centre, while the Canadians and 
Indians fell upon the flanks. The distant platoon fire of the 
French did but little execution, so that the Americans soon 
recovered their spirits and determined on a most resolute 
defence. As soon as their artillery began to play, the 
Canadian militia and Indians, who were not accustomed 
to such terrible engines of destruction, fled in confusion 
and dismay to the swamps. Meeting with a warmer 
reception than he anticipated, and deserted by his allies, 
Dieskau was compelled, reluctantly, to order a retreat. 
His troops retiring in great disorder, were followed briskly 
by a party from the camp, who fell furiously on their 
rear, and precipitated their flight. 

Baron Dieskau, who had received a wound in his leg, 
was found leaning against a stump entirely alone. While 
feeling for his watch, one of the Americans, now supposed 
to be General Pomeroy, suspecting him to be in search of 
a pistol, inflicted upon him another wound, which ulti- 
mately proved mortal, and conducted him a prisoner to 
the camp. 

The English not continuing their pursuit, the enemy 

halted about four miles from the camp, at the very place 

where the engagement took place in the morning, and 

opened their packs for refreshment. While thus engaged, 

D 



50 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

a detachment of two hundred of the New Hampshire 
militia, under the brave Captain McGinnes, who had 
been dispatched from Fort Edward to the assistance of 
the main body, fell upon them and completely routed 
them. Captain McGinnes fell in the action. A large 
number of prisoners were taken. For this victory General 
Johnson was rewarded with a baronetcy, and a gift of five 
hundred pounds. 

It was in this battle of Lake George, that Thayendane- 
gea, the young Mohawk chief, better known as Joseph 
Brant, made his first appearance on the field of war. He 
was only thirteen years old. In relating the particulars 
of the bloody engagement, some time after, he stated, that 
" he was seized with such a tremor when the firing com- 
menced, that he was obliged to take hold of a sapling to 
steady himself; but, after a few volleys, he recovered the 
use of his limbs, and the composure of his mind, so as to 
support the character of a brave man." He was born to 
be a warrior, as his history abundantly proves. " I like," 
said he, when some one was speaking of music, " I like 
the harpsichord well, and the organ still better ; but I like 
the drum and trumpet best of all, for they make my heart 
beat quick." 

For the purpose of securing the country from the incur- 
sions of the enemy, General Johnson erected a fort at the 
place of his encampment, which he named Fort William 
Henry. The remainder of the season was occupied in 
completing the intrenchments, with an occasional skir- 
mish between reconnoitring and foraging parties, but with- 
out any attempt, on either side, to give or provoke a 
general engagement. 

Soon after Putnam's arrival in the camp, he became 
intimately acquainted with a famous partizan, Captain, after- 
wards Major, Rogers, whose eminent services, as com- 



MAJOR ROGERS. 51 

mander of the corps of New Hampshire Rangers, contribut- 
ed so much to the success of this expedition. Rogers kept a 
journal of his own achievements, and that of his corps, 
which was published in London, in 1765. It is full of 
stirring interest, though manifestly incorrect in some re- 
spects. There is a studied omission of the services, and 
even of the name of Putnam, so glaring as to impress the 
mind of one acquainted with the facts, that it was the result 
of some private pique, which the author was not willing to 
acknowledge. In some essential points, which we shall 
notice as we proceed, the journal differs entirely from the 
orderly books of the army ; and, in others, from the nar- 
rative which Mr. Putnam's biographer, Col. David Hum- 
phreys, had from his own lips. The discrepancies discover- 
ed relate almost exclusively to those matters in which Put- 
nam shared the hardship and the glory. There can be no more 
authentic record of such matters than the orderly books of 
the army ; and as to Putnam's word, it was always regard- 
ed, by all who knew him, as worthy of entire and implicit 
credit. The learned Dr. Dwight, afterwards President of 
Yale College, was his intimate friend. He was not a man 
to " give flattering titles to any," or sacrifice truth to the 
mere euphony of a panegyric. It was he who wrote the 
epitaph upon Putnam's tomb, in which, after commending 
his patriotism and his martial virtues, as above all praise, 
he speaks of him as " a man, whose generosity was singu- 
lar, whose honesty was proverbial," &c. Dr. Dwight al- 
ludes to him elsewhere in his writings, and always with 
the same unlimited confidence. " His word," says he, 
" was regarded as ample security for anything for which it 
was pledged, and his uprightness commanded absolute con- 
fidence." 

The omissions in Rogers' journal are the more remark- 
able, since it was to Putnam that the writer was once in 



52 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

debted for the preservation of his life, at the hazard of his 
own. Whether it was Putnam's frank, open, republican 
simplicity of manners, or his bold and successful daring, 
threatening an eclipse to his own fame as a ranger, that 
rendered him both ungrateful and oblivious in these cases, 
it is impossible now to decide. It is clear, however, that 
he had little feeling in common with his countrymen, and 
that, when he performed the remarkable services ascribed 
to him in " the Seven Years' war," it was not as an Ameri- 
can, but as a loyal servant of his majesty. This loyalty he 
retained to the end ; and, when the war of the Revolution 
broke out, he was found in the British service, fighting 
against the liberties of the land of his birth. His journal 
was published in London the same year with the passage 
of the stamp act, and after the dispute between the colo- 
nies and the mother country had begun to wax uncomfort- 
ably warm.* 

Sometimes in company with Rogers, and sometimes 
alone, Putnam was employed in reconnoitering the enemy's 
lines, gaining intelligence of his movements, and taking 
straggling prisoners, as well as in beating up the quarters, 
and surprising the advanced picquets of their army. For 
these purposes, in addition to the regular corps of Rangers, 
under Captain Rogers, Putnam and his corps, as we have 
already stated, though not originally drafted for such a 
service, were assigned to these difficult and perilous under- 
takings. The first time the two Captains went out toge- 
ther, it was the fortune of Putnam to preserve the life of 
Rogers, by striking down with his own hands a (French- 
man, who was about to plunge a dagger into his heart. 

The object of the expedition, on which they were de- 
tached, was to obtain an accurate knowledge of the posi- 
tion of the enemy, and the state of the fortifications at 
See Appendix, No. 1. 



SAVES THE LIFE OF MAJOR ROGERS. 53 

Crown Point. The fort was so situated that it was impos- 
sible to approach it with their whole party, near enough to 
effect the purpose of their mission, without being discovered. 
To go alone, was to expose themselves to a hazard which 
was hardly justifiable, on account of the swarms of hostile 
Indians, who infested the woods. Determined, however, 
not to return without an attempt to accomplish their object, 
the two leaders left all their men in covert at a convenient 
distance, with strict orders to remain carefully concealed 
till their return ; and crept stealthily forward, under cover 
of the darkness, till they reached the near vicinity of the 
fortress. Here they laid during the night, without making 
any satisfactory discoveries. Early in the morning they 
approached nearer, and spent considerable time in examin- 
ing the defences from several points of view. Having 
completed their observations, and obtained all the informa- 
tion they desired upon the several points to which their 
attention had been directed, they were about returning to 
their covert, when Rogers, being separated from his com- 
rade a short distance, suddenly encountered a stout French- 
man, who, instantly giving the alarm to a guard near by, 
seized his fusee with one hand, and with the other made a 
desperate effort to stab him. 

A severe struggle ensued. The guard answered the 
call, and there was imminent danger of having the whole 
garrison upon them at once. Perceiving that no time 
was to be lost, and that further alarm would be given, 
and their danger greatly increased, if he should fire, Put- 
nam sprang upon the Frenchman, administered a heavy 
blow upon his head with the butt end of his musket, and 
laid him dead at his feet. Thus relieved, and expecting 
instant pursuit, they flew with the utmost speed to the 
mountains, joined their party in ambush, and returned, 



54 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

without further incident, to the camp. This was in the 
latter part of October. 

The fortress at Crown Point being found too strong, and 
too ably garrisoned, to justify an attack, and the season 
being now far advanced, the greater part of the army was 
discharged, reserving only six hundred men, under the 
immediate command of General Johnson, to garrison Forts 
Edward and William Henry. The French, in the mean 
time, took possession of Ticonderoga, at the northern out- 
let of Lake George, and fortified it strongly. 

The colonial troops having enlisted only for the cam- 
paign, Captain Putnam's term of service ended with the 
season, and he returned home to pass the winter in the 
quiet enjoyment of domestic life, and to look after the inte- 
rests of his growing family and his thrifty farm, With a 
versatility peculiar to a pioneer life, he exchanged the 
sword for the ploughshare, and the gilded military coat 
for the homespun frock, equally willing and able to till the 
soil, as to fight in its defence.

THE plan of the campaign of 1756, as agreed upon in a 
council of the colonial governors, held at Albany in the 
early part of the season, was similar to that of the preced- 
ing year having for its object the reduction of Crown 
Point, Niagara, and Fort Duquesne. Putnam was re-ap- 
pointed to his command, under his old leader Major- 
General Abercrombie being commander-in-chief until the 
latter part of July, when he was superseded by the Earl 
of Loudoun. The expedition against Crown Point was 
committed to Major-General Winslow, which he was to 
conduct with the provincial forces alone, without any aid 
from the British troops, who were reserved to garrison and 
defend the forts. 

The astonishing success of Montcalm at Forts Oswego 



56 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

and George, which he razed to the ground, diverted the 
British General from his offensive movement towards 
Crown Point. General Winslow was arrested in his pre- 
parations for this service, and ordered to fortify his own 
camp, in anticipation of an attack from the enemy, and an 
attempt to advance into the country, below the Lake 
Champlain,by way of South Bay or Wood Creek. Gene- 
ral Webb, with fourteen hundred men, was stationed at 
the great carrying place, near Wood Creek ; and Sir Wil- 
liam Johnson, with one thousand, at the German Flats, on 
the Mohawk, and nearly half way to Oswego. In these 
precautionary and defensive measures the campaign passed 
off without another battle. 

But, though a season of inactivity to the body of the 
army, and the commanders, it was full of stirring incident 
to Putnam and others, whose task it was to watch the 
movements, and annoy the outposts of the enemy. Adven- 
tures of this kind are sufficiently hazardous in the day- 
time ; but, when attempted in the night, they are pecu- 
liarly liable to accidents. Having been commanded to 
reconnoitre the enemy's camp, at a place called " The 
Ovens," near Ticonderoga, Captain Putnam took as a 
companion in the enterprise, the brave Lieutenant Robert 
Durkee. In the prosecution of the duties assigned him, he 
narrowly escaped being made a prisoner himself, in the 
first instance, and killing his comrade, in the second. It 
was the custom, with the British and Provincial troops, to 
arrange their camp fires along the outer lines of their 
encampment, which gave a great advantage to the enemy's 
scouts and patrols, laying open the whole extent of the 
camp to their view, and frequently exposing the sentinels 
to be picked off by expert marksmen. A contrary, and 
much more rational practice, prevailed among the French 
and Indians. They kindled their fires in the centre, lodged 



HAZARDOUS RECONNOITRE. 57 

their men circularly at a distance, and posted their senti- 
nels in the surrounding darkness. Ignorant of this arrange- 
ment, and supposing that the French sentries were within 
the circle of the fires, the bold scouts approached the camp, 
creeping upon their hands and knees with the greatest 
possible caution, until, to their utter astonishment, they 
found themselves in the very thickest of the enemy. The 
sentinels, seeing by the light of the fires beyond that some 
one had passed stealthily without challenge, gave the 
alarm and fired. Durkee was slightly wounded in the 
thigh. 

There was, of course, no alternative but instant flight. 
Putnam, being foremost, and scarcely able, on turning 
away from the glare of the fires, to see his hand before 
him, soon plunged into a clay-pit. Durkee, limping 
briskly along, tumbled, with no gentle fall, into the same 
pit. Putnam, not relishing a companion so near, in such 
circumstances, and supposing him to be one of the pur- 
suing enemy, was about striking him down, when Durkee, 
who had followed so closely as to know what company he 
was in, inquired whether he had escaped unhurt. Instantly 
recognizing the voice of his friend, and rejoicing to find 
him also safe, Putnam dropped his weapon, and both, 
springing from the pit, made good their retreat to the 
neighboring ledges, amid a shower of random shot. Hav- 
ing reached a place of safety, they found shelter under the 
lee of a large log, which afforded them a comfortable lodg- 
ing for the remainder of the night 

Before composing themselves to sleep, Putnam recol- 
lected that there was a little rum left in his canteen. 
Thinking it could never be more acceptable, or useful, 
than at that time, he generously offered to share it with 
his comrade, in drinking to the confusion of the sentinel 
who had given them so unceremonious a salutation. On 



68 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

examining the canteen, however, which hung under his 
arm, it was found perfectly dry, having been pierced by 
one of the balls that had whistled about him in his flight. 
The temperance men of the present day, would doubtless 
regard that ball as having done better service than if it 
had drawn the blood of an enemy. On inspecting his 
blanket, the next day, it was found to have been pierced 
in fourteen places. Whether all this boring was the work 
of one leaden messenger from the French camp, or of 
many, it must be regarded as one of those remarkable 
escapes, which can only be referred to the protecting 
agency of a special providence, of which so many instances 
are recorded in the annals of the American wars. 

During the continuance of the army at this place, an 
incident occurred which illustrates, in a very striking man- 
ner, the singular courage and ready wit of Mr. Putnam. 
The garrison had been exceedingly annoyed by a large, 
powerful, wily Indian, who prowled about the lines under 
cover of the night, perpetrating all kinds of mischief, and 
picking off the sentinels apparently at his pleasure, and 
always eluding the utmost watchfulness of the guards. 
There was one of the outposts in particular, which had 
shared more largely than any other in his regards. For 
several nights in succession, the sentinel on that post was 
taken off in a most mysterious manner. The commanding 
officer had given directions, in case any noise should be 
heard in the vicinity of the station, that the sentinel should 
call out, " Who goes there ?" three times, and then, if no 
answer were returned, fire in the direction of the noise. 
Night after night, these orders had been given, as the post 
was supplied with a new sentinel, but without any avail. 
The post was always found deserted in the morning, until 
it came to be looked upon as certain death to venture upon 
duty at that place. 



VOLUNTEERS AS A SENTINEL. 59 

As is Casual, in well appointed armies^ the post of danger 
was sought for by the best men in the garrison ; and 
already a number of the bravest and most valuable soldiers 
had fallen in this hazardous service. It began to be diffi- 
cult to obtain volunteers. At length the post was utterly 
declined. The commander was making preparations to 
supply the place by lot, when Mr. Putnam, whose station 
as a commissioned officer excused him from all such duties 
as this, stepped forward, and solicited the honor of standing 
guard for the night. His offer was promptly accepted. 
Relying upon the rule he had already laid down, the com- 
mander reiterated the instructions he had given to previous 
sentinels, saying : " If you hear any sound from without 
the lines, you will call ' Who goes there ?' three times, and 
then, if no answer be given, fire." With these instruc- 
tions, and a promise to give a good accpunt of himself the 
next day, Putnam proceeded to his post. 

Having examined, with the utmost scrutiny, every 
tree, and shrub, and rock, in the neighborhood ; measured 
v;ith accuracy every point in the area around him; 
fixed their bearings and distances in his mind, and looked 
well to the condition of his musket, he commenced his 
monotonous tramp, to and fro, along his portion of the line 
His plan of operations had been fully digested in his ow& 
mind, before he volunteered ; and it will be seen, in the 
sequel, that he perfectly understood the nature of the 
Indian's artifice, and the manner in which he had taken 
advantage of the previous sentinels. 

For several hours, nothing occurred to attract his notice, 
or disturb his thoughts. At length, about midnight, his 
quick ear discerned a slight rustling among the grass, as 
of an animal stealthily approaching, or passing his post. 
Presently, this rustling was followed by a crackling sound, 
like that made by a hog munching acorns. Determined 



60 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

that not even a hog should trespass with impunity upon 
his premises, he raised his musket to his shoulder, and 
adjusting his aim with great care toward the spot from 
which the sounds proceeded, called out, " Who goes there 
three times ?" and instantly discharged his piece. It was 
followed by a deep groan, and a struggle as of one in the 
agonies of death. On examining the spot, a huge Indian 
was found, disguised in a bear-skin, and now just breathing 
his last. He had been shot through the heart. From 
that time the sentinels paced their rounds unmolested, and 
the fatal outpost lost its pre-eminence as the post of 
danger.* 

In the course of the summer, a body of the enemy, con- 
sisting of six hundred men, attacked the baggage and 
provision waggons of the American army, at a place called 
Half-way Brook it being equi-distant from Fort Edward 
and Fort William Henry. Having killed the oxen, and 
plundered the waggons, they retreated with their booty, 
experiencing but little interruption from the small body 
of troops by whom the convoy was escorted. When the 
tidings of this disaster reached the camp, Captains Put- 
nam and Rogers were ordered to pursue the plunderers, 
and recover or destroy their booty. They were directed 
to embark with one hundred volunteers in boats, with two 
wall-pieces, and as many blunderbusses, and proceed down 
Lake George to a certain point, there to leave the bat- 
teaux under a proper guard, and thence to cross by land, 
so as to harass, and, if possible, intercept the retreating 
enemy at the narrows. 

* This incident was furnished by a gentleman of the first re- 
spectability, to whom it was communicated some thirty years ago, 
by Jared Scarborough, Esq., of Brooklyn, a neighbor and inti- 
mate friend of Putnam, and a sharer in some of his military enter- 
prises. 



A DOUBLE VICTORY. 61 

These orders were executed with so much spirit and 
punctuality, that the party arrived at the spot designated 
for the attack a full half hour before the hostile boats came 
in view. Waiting under cover of the woods until the 
enemy, wholly unsuspicious of the ambush, entered the 
narrows, their boats deeply loaded with plunder, the 
volunteers commenced a brisk and galling fire. They 
poured in upon them volley after volley, killed many of 
the oarsmen, sunk a number of the boats, and would 
have cut off the whole body, encumbered as they were 
with baggage, had not a strong wind, favoring their des- 
perate exertions to escape, swept a few of them through 
the narrows into the South Bay, and beyond the reach of 
the guns of their assailants. This shattered remnant of 
the little fleet, pushing on with desperate speed to Ticon- 
deroga, reported the disaster, and gave information that 
Putaam and Rogers were at the narrows, with a large 
detachment of provincials. 

A fresh party, of three hundred French and Indians, 
was instantly despatched to intercept them on their return 
to Fort Edward, and cut them in pieces. Anticipating 
the probability of such an attempt, and being fully twenty 
miles from their boats, they strained every nerve to reach 
them before night. With incredible exertion they effect- 
ed their object, and were soon embarked, and moving 
briskly down the lake. On the following day, having pro- 
ceeded as far as Sabbath-day Point, they discovered on 
shore the pursuing party, who must have passed them un- 
perceived in the night. As soon as the boats came in 
view, the French embarked with great alacrity, and rowed 
out into the lake, to give them battle. They advanced in 
regular line, with a bold and confident air, felicitating 
themselves upon the certain prospect of an easy victory, 
from the great superiority of their numbers. Flushed with 



62 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM 

these expectations, they were permitted to come within 
pistol shot before a gun was fired. Then, at a signal, the 
wall pieces and blunderbusses, which had been brought 
to rake the enemy in their most vulnerable point, were 
simultaneously discharged. No such broadside reception 
as this having been anticipated, the assailants were thrown 
into the utmost, disorder. The confusion and dismay was 
greatly increased by a well-directed and most destructive 
fire from the small arms. The larger pieces being re- 
loaded without annoyance, continued, alternately with the 
musketry, to make such dreadful havoc, that the enemy 
never recovered from the first surprise and dismay, suffi- 
ciently to make one vigorous effort to rally. The rout 
was complete. The loss of the French was very great. 
In one of the canoes, containing twenty Indians, only five 
escaped. From other boats great numbers, both of French 
and Indians, were seen to fall overboard. The remainder, 
crippled and shattered, and laden with the wounded and 
the dying, glad of an opportunity to abandon the scene of 
so mortifying and terrible a defeat, were driven back to 
Ticonderoga. Of the American party, only one man was 
killed, and two slightly wounded. Having dispersed their 
enemies, they landed on the Point, refreshed themselves 
at leisure, and then returned in good order and high spirits 
to the British camp, having inflicted upon an enemy vastly 
superior in numbers a most mortifying defeat, and an 
amount of loss scarcely inferior to that of some pitched 
battles. The loss of the French, in both engagements, 
could not have been less than five hundred men a heavy 
price to pay for their bold reprisals upon the American 
baggage train. 

Another incident occurred soon after, which, though of 
no great interest in itself, or in its results, will serve to 
illustrate the nature of the tasks imposed upon a bold and 



ALMOST A PRISONER. 63 

active partisan ; the vigilance, fearlessness, enterprise and 
prudence they demanded of him, and the imminent peril 
to which his life was constantly exposed. The season 
was far advanced. It was hardly expected that there 
would be any active hostilities during the present cam- 
paign, but it was very desirable to obtain, if possible, some 
definite information of the strength and designs of the 
enemy. For this purpose Captain Putnam was sent out, 
with five men, to procure a prisoner from some of the 
straggling parties of the enemy. Approaching the camp 
with all the circumspection of an Indian scout, he found 
a place of concealment exactly adapted to his purpose, in 
a thicket that skirted the road leading from Ticonderoga 
to the Ovens. His men, whose valor for the moment got 
the better of their discretion, ascribing the caution of their 
leader to cowardice, were very unwilling to confine them- 
selves within this covert. It was with difficulty that they 
were prevented from exposing themselves in such a man- 
ner as to defeat entirely the object of their enterprise, and 
put the lives of the whole party to unnecessary hazard. 
The issue proved the truth of the common remark, that 
they who are most frold and boisterous .when no danger is 
near, are the first to shrink from it, when it approaches. 

The party had not been long within their covert, when 
a Frenchman and an Indian passed ; the Indian being con- 
siderably in advance. Watching his opportunity, when 
the Indian was far enough off to render any interference 
on his part improbable, Putnam sprang from the thicket, 
ordering his men to follow. After running about thirty 
rods, he overtook the Frenchman, seized him by the 
shoulder, and commanded him to surrender. His men, 
who were lately so bold, now realized the advantage of a 
place of concealment ; and, disregarding the order of their 
captain, left him to meet single-handed the danger of a 



64 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

conflict with two of their foes. The Frenchman looking 
round, and perceiving no other enemy, and knowing that 
his Indian friend would soon be at hand to assist him, ob- 
stinately resisted being made a prisoner. Putnam, finding 
himself betrayed by his men into a perilous dilemma, and 
knowing that no time was to be lost, let go his hold, 
stepped a few paces back, and levelled his piece at the 
Frenchman's breast. It missed fire ; whereupon the 
Frenchman, seeing his advantage, gave the alarm to his 
Indian comrade, and sprung furiously upon his assailant. 
Putnam thought it prudent to retreat, and thus drew his 
enemy off in the direction of the place where his men were 
posted, and where, if they had not shown themselves too 
soon, he would inevitably have fallen into their hands 
They played their part so ill, however, that he discovered 
the ambuscade in season to effect his escape. 

It was now a dangerous neighborhood for the American 
scouts. The alarm had been given, and a diligent and active 
pursuit was sure to be the consequence. They, therefore, 
made a precipitate flight, and arrived without accident at 
their own camp. Mortified with the result of this adven- 
ture, Putnam dismissed his men with disgrace, selected 
another party, on whom he could rely with confidence, 
and set forth again on the same hazardous errand. Of the 
incidents of this adventure, we are not informed. It was 
brief and successful, however, as might have been pre- 
dicted from the character of its leader, for he never aban- 
doned an enterprise, while there was a reasonable hope of 
accomplishing it. 

To those who are unacquainted with the duties and dan- 
gers of the camp, and with the peculiar difficulties to be 
overcome, in a country covered with thick forests, and 
with but few roads besides the Indian footpaths, such insig- 
nificant feats as the capture of a single prisoner, or a visit 



HIS STANDING IN THEARMY. 65 

of observation to the enemy's lines, \vill hardly appear of 
sufficient importance to be recorded ; and the services of 
the bold and able adventurers, by whom they are achieved, 
will, of course, be lightly appreciated. They may be 
assured, however, that they were viewed in a very differ- 
ent light by the commanders, for whose benefit they were 
undertaken. There were few men in the army, who could 
not have been better spared than these ; and, during the 
greater part of the campaign, they were the only men 
who were employed in any active service, or knew any- 
thing of the perils and hardships of war. 

In this department, no one was more useful, no one 
stood higher in the estimation of the commanding generals, 
than Captain Putnam. He was found to be possessed, in 
happy combination, of all the qualities required for this 
peculiar service. To a total insensibility to danger, he 
united prudence, circumspection, sagacity, and uncommon 
fertility of resources, which was equal to any exigency. 
The employment of a scout and a ranger was admirably 
adapted to bring out and display these peculiar qualities, 
though, unfortunately for their possessor, the sphere in 
which he operated was too limited, and the duties he per- 
formed of too private and confidential a nature, to secure 
for him a conspicuous place in the history of those times. 
Such services rarely receive their due award of fame, un- 
less the brave men who render them become their own 
trumpeters. They come not within the range of the ordi- 
nary records of the army. From their very nature, they 
are concealed from the public gaze at the time of their 
achievement. They are planned in secret, and executed 
in secret their efficiency and success often depending as 
much upon the fidelity w r ith which their secret character 
is maintained, as upon any other circumstance. The 
movements of an army, the fate of a battle the whole

matter at issue in a war have often been decided by the 
information communicated to the commanders by a single 
scout. Yet his name is not mentioned, nor his agency 
acknowledged, either by the general in making up his 
report of the issue, or by the historian in recording it for pos- 
terity. The simple, phrase " The general having receiv- 
ed information," &c., covers it all ; while the hazards at 
which that information was obtained are lost sight of, and 
the boldness of manoeuvre, the correctness of observation, 
the sagacity, and sound judgment, required to render it 
valuable, are credited to the genius and foresight of the 
commander. 

Putnam kept no journal. A few of his adventures were 
partially preserved in the orderly books, and some found 
their way into the newspapers of the day ; while some 
were transmitted from friend to friend, for many years, 
without appearing in print. He enjoyed an uncommon 
popularity in the army. " He was endeared to the soldiers, 
hy the cheerfulness with which he shared their perils and 
privations, and the gallantry which suffered none to go, 
where he did not himself lead the way ; to his superior 
officers, by the energy and promptness with which he 
executed their commands ; and he began to rise, in the 
estimation of the public generally, as one who was des- 
tined to become distinguished in a broader field of action."

IN 17o7 the Legislature of Connecticut conferred on Put- 
nam the commission of a Major. Notwithstanding the 
many reverses of the Anglo-American forces hitherto, great 
exertions were made for opening this campaign with an 
army that should make success almost certain. What 
might have been the result, had this army been guided by 
a competent commander, it is impossible to say. But the 
British government, refusing to learn wisdom from the 
disasters of past years, persisted in placing the whole con- 
trol of the affairs of the colonies in the hands of English 
officers, who knew nothing of the country, and scorned to 
take the smallest advice from the provincials with whom 
they were associated. In the present instance, they were 
more than usually unfortunate in their selection. Of all 
the generals who served at any time in America, Lord 
Loudouu was the most incompetent to the arduous service. 



68 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

He had superseded General Abercrombie about the middle 
of the previous campaign, and had been frightened, by the 
success of Montcalm at Oswego, from attempting any other 
measures than those of mere defence. 

During the winter his Lordship made large requisitions 
upon the colonial Legislatures for the increase of the 
army. The call was responded to with great alacrity. 
At the same time, a large fleet and army arrived from 
Europe, and the colonists began to look upon the speedy 
downfall of the power of France in America as almost 
certain. 

Their hopes were doomed to a bitter disappointment. 
Instead of following up, as they expected, the designs of 
the previous campaigns, by striking a decisive blow in the 
direction of Canada, and shielding their northern frontier 
from the continual inroads of the enemy, the commander- 
in-chief, under pretence of concentrating all his force upon 
one point, and achieving a certain and brilliant victory 
there, turned his whole attention upon Louisburg, in the 
island, of Cape Breton. It was midsummer before his 
preparations for this expedition were completed. When 
all things were ready, and his forces, both naval and mili- 
tary, assembled at Halifax, he learned that a powerful 
fleet had arrived at Louisburg from Brest, with a large 
reinforcement for the garrison. This disconcerted all his 
plans. The expedition was at once abandoned, and with 
it all idea of offensive operations. It required but a single 
demonstration on the part of the enemy to exhaust the 
valor of the over-discreet Earl, and throw him upon his 
defence. Leaving the fleet to watch the motions of the 
French, he returned to New York to refresh himself for 
the next year's campaign. 

Meanwhile, the French commander, Montcalm, secure 
with respect to Louisburg, and encouraged by the diver- 



FORT WILLIAM HENRY. 69 

sion in that direction of so large a part of the British 
forces, determined to make a bold push to secure the 
entire possession of Lake George. The condition of Fort 
William Henry, the frontier post of the Americans, was 
such as to invite assault. It was an ill-constructed and 
ill-appointed fortification, occupying a small eminence, 
which rose gradually from the waters of the lake, near its 
southern extremity. It was garrisoned at that time by 
about three thousand men, under Colonel Munroe, while 
General Webb, who commanded in the northern depart- 
ment, was stationed at Fort Edward, about fifteen miles 
below, with a considerably larger force. He was an offi- 
cer of nearly as much courage and capacity as Lord 
Loudoun, and a fit representative of that nobleman in any 
situation where he might be placed. 

About the first of August, this valorous commander 
who always took especial care to provide for his own 
safety proceeded, under the escort of Major Putnam, 
with two hundred chosen men, to examine in person the- 
state of the defences at Fort William Henry. While there, 
Putnam proposed to go down the lake, with a party of 
five men, and reconnoitre the enemy's position at Ticon- 
deroga, and the adjacent posts. 

This proposition was rejected by the prudent com- 
mander as altogether too hazardous. At length, how- 
ever, he was permitted to undertake the enterprise with 
eighteen volunteers. They immediately embarked in 
three whale-boats, and set forward on their expedition. 
Before reaching Northwest Bay, the place where they 
proposed to land, they discovered a large body of the 
enemy on an island. Satisfied that this indicated a south- 
ward movement of the French, preparator3 T to an attack 
upon our fortresses, and desirous, in case he and his party 
should be cut off or taken, to put his commander upon his 



70 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

guard, he immediately directed two of the boats to lie to, 
as if for the purpose of fishing, while he with the other 
returned to report progress. The general, seeing him 
rowing back with great speed, in a single boat, and sup- 
posing that the others had fallen into the hands of the 
enemy, sent out a skiff, with orders for the major alone 
to come on shore. After making his report to the gene- 
ral, and explaining what he conceived to be the evident 
design of the enemy, he proposed returning immediately, 
to rejoin his companions, and prosecute his discoveries still 
further. 

Webb, unwilling to part with his escort in such an 
alarming emergency, preferred leaving the two boats to 
their fate, rather than send so brave a man to bring 
them off. Putnam was urgent, however, and the general 
yielded a reluctant assent. Pushing vigorously out, he 
found his men where he had left them, though more intent 
upon the motions of the men on shore, than upon securing 
a very large draught of fishes. Passing on a little farther, 
he presently encountered a large number of boats in motion 
on the lake from the foremost of which he was enabled 
to escape only by the superior fleetness of his own, and the 
vigorous exertions of his rowers. 

Convinced, beyond a doubt, that this formidable arma- 
ment was destined against Fort William Henry, he hasten- 
ed his return to that place, and communicated to General 
Webb all he had seen, and his views of the object of the 
hostile expedition. That commander, strictly enjoining 
silence on the subject, directed him to put his men under 
an oath of secresy, and to prepare, without loss of time, to 
return to the head-quarters of the army. Major Putnam 
argued strenuously against such a desertion of the post in 
the moment of danger, and earnestly pleaded the duty of 
meeting the enemy on the shore, should he presume to

land. But General Webb was resolute in his decision. 
He would neither remain himself, nor suffer his escort to 
remain. Accordingly, the following day, he returned to 
Fort Edward, and sent up a detachment to reinforce the 
garrison at Fort William Henry. The day following its 
arrival, Montcalm invested the fortress with a force of 
seven thousand French and Canadian soldiers, and two 
thousand Indians. 

To resist this formidable army, there were only twenty- 
five hundred men in the garrison. Their commander, 
Colonel Munroe, was a gallant officer, and worthy of the 
post of danger. It was the third of August, when Mont- 
calm commenced the siege with a summons to surrender. 
In his letter to Colonel Munroe, he urged the capitulation 
by considerations of humanity ; declaring that he had an 
engine of such fearful power in his hands, that, when once 
set in motion, it would be impossible to check or control 
it. His influence over his Indian allies, to restrain them 
from the commission of every atrocity, would be utterly 
lost, as soon as the first drop of blood was shed. No writ- 
ten answer was given to this summons. A verbal reply 
was returned by the bearer, that the fort would be defend- 
ed to the last extremity. 

With this resolution, the garrison held out until the 
ninth. In the meantime, Colonel Munroe had found 
means to send several expresses to Fort Edward, soliciting 
relief in the most urgent manner, and declaring his inten- 
tion to hold out till relief should arrive. But, though the 
force at that place had been considerably increased by the 
arrival of General Johnson's troops, and the militia, Webb 
resolved that no succor could be afforded to the beleaguer- 
ed fortress. So urgent, however, were the solicitations 
of Sir William Johnson, that, after several days, that 
worthy officer, with as many as would volunteer for the 



72 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM 

service, marched for its relief. The privilege was eagerly 
embraced by the provincials, including Putnam's corps. 
They had scarcely been gone an hour, however, when the 
general's heart failed him, and a messenger was dispatch- 
ed, ordering their instant return. 

It was this miserable, shameful pusillanimity, on the 
part of the commander of the northern department, that 
occasioned the loss of Fort William Henry, and the bloody 
tragedy that followed its surrender. When, some time 
after this, Putnam was a prisoner in Canada, he was assur- 
ed by Montcalm himself, that the siege would have, been 
abandoned, if this reinforcement had been suffered to go 
forward. He was informed of its approach by one of his 
Indian scouts ; who, on being questioned relative to its 
numbers, replied, in the figurative style peculiar to that 
people : " If you can count the haves on the trees, you can 
count them." 

On the receipt of this intelligence, the operations of the 
siege were actually suspended, and preparations were 
made for embarking ; while it was manifest that a new 
spirit was infused into the besieged by the assurance which 
these preparations gave, that the siege was about to be 
raised. Meanwhile, another runner came in, and reported 
that this formidable reinforcement had been recalled. The 
siege was, consequently, renewed with more vigor than 
ever. 

All expectations of relief were now at an end. Two 
of the largest guns of the fort had burst ; their ammunition 
was almost exhausted ; and further resistance seemed 
obviously unavailing. At this juncture, a letter was 
received from General Webb, advising a surrender, and 
stating, definitively, that no succor could be expected from 
Fort Edward. Articles of capitulation were, accordingly, 
agreed upon and signed Honorable terms were granted 



SHAMEFUL MASSACRE BY THE INDIANS 73 

to the garrison, " on account of their honorable defence," 
as it was expressed in the articles. . They were to march 
out with the honors of war, with their arms and baggage, 
and retire under an escort to Fort Edward, with a solemn 
pledge of protection against the Indians. This pledge, 
however, was shamefully disregarded. The scene which 
followed is one of the darkest in the bloody annals of war, 
and, even at this distant day, can hardly be recited with- 
out a thrill of horror. The troops began their march of 
evacuation. The last files had scarcely issued from the 
gates, when the whole body of Indians attached to the 
French army fell upon them with the fury of hungry 
tigers, and commenced an indiscriminate slaughter. Great 
numbers were killed. Many weFe taken prisoners, and 
dragged off to a captivity worse than death, in the deep 
forests of the west. A miserable remnant escaped, among 
whom was the gallant Munroe, and reached Fort Edward 
in a most forlorn condition. 

Different writers have taken different views of the con- 
duct of the French general, in relation to this cruel massa- 
cre. Some declare, as the testimony of those who were 
eye-witnesses of the scene, that no efforts were made by 
the French to arrest^ these atrocities ; no protection, de- 
manded alike by honor and humanity, was given to those 
to whom it had been sacredly pledged. Others say, that 
the utmost exertions of the French commander were used 
to restrain his savage allies ; and that he and his officers 
did everything, except firing upon the Indians, to put a 
stop to the merciless butchery. For the honor of huma- 
nity, it is to be hoped that the latter judgment is correct; 
and charity inclines us to accept it. There is certainly 
something to sustain it, in the caution which accompanied 
the original summons to surrender. 

The panic-stricken Webb, expecting that this decisive 
4 



74 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

victory would be followed up by a similar demonstration 
against Fort Edward, sent out Captain Putnam with his 
corps, to watch the motions of the enemy. His previous 
conduct leaves us little room to doubt, that he would have 
abandoned his post at once, without firing a gun, if Mont- 
calm had turned his face in that direction. With such 
men as these to control the movements of the army, it is 
no matter of surprise, that the earlier campaigns of the 
Seven Years' war presented a continual series of disaster, 
defeat and desolation. 

Putnam reached the scene of carnage, just as the rear- 
guard of the enemy were embarking on the lake. The 
fort was dismantled and demolished. The cannon, stores and 
water-craft were all carried off. The barracks, outhouses 
and sutlers' booths had been fired, and were still burning, 
and hundreds of human bodies lay, half consumed, among 
the smoking ruins. More than one hundred women were 
found among them, some with the brains still oozing from 
their battered heads ; others with their hairless sculls in 
ghastly baldness, the entire crown having been wrenched 
away ; many mangled, lacerated, hacked to pieces, and 
violated with all the wanton mutilations of savage inge- 
nuity, lay entirely naked among the heaps of the slain sol- 
diers, as if the last effort of the wife to cling to her hus- 
band for protection, and the last wish of the husband to 
raise his arm in her defence, had brought down a tenfold 
vengeance upon the heads of both. To the generous, 
warm-hearted Putnam, whose sympathies were ever alive 
to the sufferings of his comrades, and whose constant aim 
it was to mitigate, by every means in his power, the hor- 
rors of war, the spectacle must have been truly appalling. 
We feel, as we shudder over the dreadful account, that 
there was some apology for the exterminating retribution, 
which our fathers visited upon so merciless a foe. 






FATIGUE- PARTY ATTACKED BY INDIANS. 75 

Not long after this disaster, General Lyman succeeded 
to the command of Fort Edward. He immediately set 
himself to strengthening its defences, which the French 
commander resolved, if possible, to prevent, intending, at 
an early day, to visit it in the same manner as he had done 
Fort William Henry. A party of one hundred and fifty 
men were sent out into the neighboring forest to cut timber 
for the fort. To protect them in their labors, Captain 
Little, with fifty British regulars, was posted at the head 
of a morass, about one hundred rods eastward from the 
fort. From this station there was a narrow causeway 
leading to the fort, flanked on one side by the morass, and 
on the other by a small creek. 

One morning, at break of day, the attention of one of 
the sentinels was arrested, by what he conceived to be 
birds, coming up from the thicket of the morass, and flying 
with incredible swiftness over his head. While wonder- 
ing what species of bird it could be, whose flight was 
so rapid as to elude observation, he was suddenly enlight- 
ened by seeing one of these winged messengers, in the 
shape of an Indian arrow, quivering in the tree just over 
his head. A large body of savages had crept stealthily 
into the morass during the night, and were attempting, in 
this manner, to pick off the sentinel, without creating an 
alarm, in order to surprise and cut off the whole party. 

The alarm was instantly given. The Indians, finding 
themselves discovered, rushed from their covert upon the 
unarmed laborers, shot and tomahawked those who were 
nearest at hand, and pressed hard on the remainder, as 
they fled in dismay towards the fort. Captain Little and 
his band flew to their arms, and pouring in a well-timed 
and spirited fire, checked the pursuit, and covered the 
retreat of the fatigue-men, till those who were not wound- 
ed in the first onset, were enabled to reach the shelter of 



76 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

the fort. His little party, being almost overpowered by 
superior numbers, he sent to General Lyman for assistance. 
But that commander, taken by surprise, ignorant of the 
extent of the danger, and imagining that this assault was 
only the precursor of a general attack from the main body 
of the enemy, called in his outposts, and shut the gates, 
-and left the brave band to their fate. 

Major Putnam, with his corps of Rangers, was stationed 
at one of the outposts, on a small island adjacent to the 
fort. Hearing the discharge of the musketry, and learning 
from his runners that his friend, Capt. Little, was in immi- 
nent peril of being cut 1 off, he plunged into the river, fol- 
lowed by his men, and waded through the water to the 
scene of action. Passing near the fort on his way, Gene- 
ral Lyman was apprised of his movement. Unwilling that 
the lives of a few more brave men should be exposed 
to what he deemed inevitable destruction, he mounted 
the parapet, and ordered him to proceed no farther. The 
bold ranger, willing to jeopard not only his life, but, if ne- 
cessary, his standing, in order to rescue his friend, made a 
brief apology, and, without waiting to ascertain whether it 
was satisfactory, hurried on to the scene of conflict. In a 
few minutes they had opened their way to the little hand- 
ful of regulars, who maintained their ground with the 
utmost gallantry. At the suggestion of Putnam, the whole 
party now rushed impetuously, with shouts and huzzas, 
into the swamp. The charge was completely successful. 
The Indians fled in every direction, and were pursued 
with great slaughter until night-fall. On the part of the 
chase, only one man was killed during the pursuit ; and 
his death was immediately revenged by that of the Indian 
who shot him. This Indian was one of that valuable class, 
called Runners a chosen body of active young men, 
whose principal occupation is to procure intelligence, and 



CENSURE EXPECTED BUT ESCAPED. 77 

convey tidings ; but who are sometimes employed in cov- 
ering the rear on a retreat. 

Returning in triumph from the chase, Putnam expected 
a reprimand, if not something more severe, from his com- 
mander. It was the only instance, in the course of his 
military career, in which he failed to render the strictest 
obedience to orders. His motive in this case was highly 
commendable, and his apology was strongly fortified by 
the brilliant success of his sortie. But neither purity of 
motive, nor brilliancy of success, can sanction -a departure 
from the rigid rules of discipline, which are absolutely 
necessary to the maintenance of order and authority in the 
camp. So seductive is the influence of a brave man's 
example, particularly when, crowned with new laurels, 
he returns from some splendid achievement, undertaken in 
contravention of the positive orders of his superior, that, 
however elevated the rank of the officer, or however meri- 
torious the service rendered, it would not be well to pass 
it by unheeded. According to the ordinary usages of war, 
Putnam should have been subjected to a court-martial, 
immediately on his return. Why this usage was departed 
from in his case we are not informed. It is probable, 
however, that General Lyman, when he recovered from 
his alarm, and found that no assault was intended, was 
more ready to admit the apology of his subaltern, than he 
would otherwise have been, since it saved him from the 
painful reflection that a brave band of his own men had 
been unnecessarily exposed to be cut in pieces by a supe- 
rior force. He chose to treat his order rather as advisa- 
tory than peremptory, and commending the good conduct 
of his men, welcomed them, with a hearty good will, to 
their quarters. 

During the ensuing winter, when the army were com- 
fortably sheltered in their quarters at Fort Edward, a 'ire 



78 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

broke out in the barracks, adjacent to the north-western 
bastion, Within twelve feet of these barracks stood the 
magazine, containing three hundred barrels of powder. 
The fire was so far advanced, when it was first discovered, 
that it raged with great violence, almost bidding defiance 
to every effort to extinguish it. By the orders of Colonel 
Haviland, who then commanded at this post, several pieces 
of heavy artillery were brought to bear upon the barracks, 
with a view of severing their supporters, and thus levelling 
them to the ground. The effort was unsuccessful, and 
the flames continued to spread with great rapidity. Major 
Putnam, who still occupied his outpost station on the adja- 
cent island, hearing the alarm, and seeing the smoke and 
flames rising in a dense column to the clouds, hastened to 
the fort to render what assistance he could. When he 
arrived, the flames were spreading fiercely in the direction 
of the magazine, which was now in imminent danger. 

By his suggestion, a line of soldiers was formed through 
a postern gate to the river, from which a constant supply 
of water was conveyed. Putnam, mounting a ladder to 
the eaves of me building, received the water, and distri- 
buted it upon the burning rafters, with a perseverance that 
had well nigh cost him his life. Notwithstanding all their 
efforts, the flames continued to gain upon him, but he stood 
to his post undaunted, completely enveloped in smoke, and 
so near the sheet of flame, that a pair of thick blanket mit- 
tens was entirely burned from his hands. Calling for ano- 
ther pair, which he dipped in water and kept thoroughly 
wet, he persevered in his perilous efforts to subdue the 
devouring element. Colonel Haviland, considering his 
situation to be too dangerous, urged him to come down, 
and try some other means that involved less personal expo- 
sure. He replied that there was no hope but in resisting 
the enemy inch by inch, and that a moment's suspension 



FIRE IN THE GARRISON. 79 

of their efforts might give it an advantage which would 
prove fatal to them all. He therefore entreated to be suf- 
fered to remain, while there was the smallest chance of 
accomplishing anything by his endeavors. The gallant 
Colonel, not less astonished than charmed at the coolness 
and intrepidity of the Major, was encouraged to renewed 
exertions. He gave orders to arrest the movements of 
the men, who were carrying away their valuables from the 
fort, and animated them to redoubled diligence in their 
efforts to extinguish the flames, exclaiming, with the heroic 
enthusiasm of a true soldier, " If we must be blown up, we 
will all go together." 

At length the flames had spread over the whole extent 
of the barracks, and began to shoot out fearfully toward 
the magazine. Putnam descended from the tottering build- 
ing, took his station between it and the magazine, and con- 
tinued, from an incessant rotation of replenished buckets, 
to resist their further progress. His efforts were bravely 
and ably seconded by officers and men. So near was the 
fire, and so intense the heat, that the outside plank sheath- 
ing of the magazine was soon consumed, leaving only a 
partition of timber between the raging element and a de- 
posit of fifteen tons of powder. When this partition, 
already charred and smoking, was exposed to view, the 
consternation became general and extreme. Had a coun- 
cil of war been convened on the instant, it would undoubt- 
edly have ordered a precipitate retreat. But the heat and 
enthusiasm of the contest left no room for consultation or 
reflection. It was an hour for action, not for debate. Put- 
nam, still undaunted, covered with a cloud of cinders, 
singed and scorched on every side, maintained his position, 
pouring an incessant stream of water upon the magazine, 
until the rafters of the barracks falling in, the source of the 



80 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

fire was cut off, and the safety of the remaining works en- 
sured. 

For an hour and a half he had contended with that ter- 
rible element. His face, his hands, his arms, and almost 
his whole body were blistered with the intensity of the 
heat, to^which he had been exposed ; and when he pulled 
off his second pair of mittens, the skin from his hands and 
fingers followed them. Several weeks elapsed, before he 
recovered from the effects of this exposure. His suffer- 
ings were great, but he was amply rewarded by the warmly 
expressed and kind attentions of his commanding officer, 
to whom his remarkable merits in the service had already 
greatly endeared him, as well as by the consciousness that 
he had been instrumental in preserving the fortress, and 
saving the lives of many, perhaps all of the garrison

UP to the commencement of the year 1758, little else than 
disaster attended the arms of the British in America. So 
humiliating was the result, considering the formidable pre- 
parations that had been made for carrying on the war, 
and the promptness and efficiency with which the colonies 
responded to the requisitions made upon them, that the 
king was compelled, by the clamorous voice of the people, 
to change his ministers. A new and powerful administra- 
tion was formed, at the head of which was Mr. Pitt, after- 
ward Lord Chatham, a man whose pre-eminent talents and 
commanding energy of character, made, and kept, the name 
of his country respected in every quarter of the globe 
P 



82 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

He assumed the helm of state in the summer of 1757, 
and his attention was at once directed to the conduct of 
the war in this country. The colonies, justly appreciating 
his vigor and talents, and feeling a perfect confidence in 
his administration, renewed their generous but exhausting 
efforts to recruit the army for the next campaign. The 
extent of their exertions can only be understpod, when it 
is considered that Massachusetts, Connecticut and New 
Hampshire supplied fifteen thousand men, at a time when 
their combined resources could hardly have been equal to 
those of any one of them at the present moment. 

The imbecile Lord Loudoun was recalled ; and General 
Abercrombie resumed the command of the Northern De- 
partment. Soon after his arrival at Fort Edward, he 
ordered Major Putnam to proceed, with sixty men, to 
South Bay, at the lower end of Lake George, for the pur- 
pose of watching the motions of the enemy, and intercept- 
ing their straggling parties. In compliance with these 
orders, the detachment marched to Wood Creek, near the 
point where it flows into South Bay, and immediately 
commenced the construction of a parapet for defence, in 
case of a sudden attack. The position was well chosen, 
on a bank, which forms a jutting precipice, overhanging 
the creek ten or twelve feet above the water. The para- 
pet was of stone, thirty feet in length, and was very inge- 
niously concealed from the view of any one who might be 
passing, by a considerable number of young pines, brought 
from a distance, and artfully disposed so as to imitate the 
natural growth. 

The service of a scout requires the utmost caution and 
silence in all his movements. It is contrary to established 
rules, and universal practice, to fire a gun, except at au 
enemy ; or to make any other noise which mio-ht expose 
the party to observation. From this necessary rule of 



MOLANG AND HIS PARTY. 83 

caution, Putnam was obliged for once to deviate, on the 
fourth day after the completion of his little fortress. Al- 
though he had sent back to the camp fifteen of his men 
who were disabled "by sickness, his stock of provisions was 
quite exhausted. A tempting opportunity to eke out his 
supply for another day, was offered by the appearance of a 
fine fat buck, that issued from the wood, with intent to 
swim across the creek in the vicinity of his camp ; and 
the prudent scout ventured a single shot to bring him in. 
It proved in the issue an expensive meal, though it was, 
fortunately, so conducted by this brave little band, as to 
throw almost the entire cost upon the enemy. 

A large party of hostile Indians and French soldiers, 
under the celebrated partizan Molang, was, just at that 
time, on its way down towards the American encampment 
in quest of plunder. The report of Major Putnam's mus- 
ket had reached the ear of one of the advanced guard of 
this party, and created a suspicion that their motions were 
watched, by those who might be troublesome to them in 
their further progress. They, therefore, proceeded with 
more caution, attempting to steal a passage through the 
creek under cover of the night hoping thereby either to 
come upon their opponents by surprise, or to pass by them 
unnoticed into the country below. Our little fortress was 
so completely masked, by its artificial cover of fresh 
pines, as to escape detection even from the practised eye 
of an Indian. 

About ten o'clock in the evening, one of the sentinels 
stationed at the margin of the Bay, gave notice that a 
considerable fleet of canoes, filled with men, was making 
its way toward the mouth of the creek. Putnam imme- 
diately called in all his sentinels, and posted his men to 
the best advantage, to give the strangers a fitting recep- 
tion. The creek, into which the enemy soon entered, was 



S4 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

about thirty yards wide ; and the bank opposite to the 
parapet was twenty feet high. The moon was at its full, 
the sky was clear, and every movement of the canoes was 
perfectly in view. A profound silence'prevailed. It was 
intended to permit the van of the little fleet to pass, and 
commence the attack upon the centre ; and the major had 
given strict orders that every man should reserve his fire 
until he gave the signal. A few of the most advanced of 
the canoes had just passed the parapet, when one of the 
soldiers behind it accidentally struck his firelock against a 
stone. The commanding officer, who was in the foremost 
canoe, alarmed at the noise, checked the advance, repeat- 
ing several times, and with earnestness, the Indian watch- 
word, "O-wish ! " Instantly the canoes crowded together 
in a confused mass, with their centre precisely in front of 
the works, covering the creek for a considerable distance 
above and below. The officers appeared to be in deep 
consultation, and the fleet was apparently on the point of 
retreating into the Bay, when Putnam gave the signal to 
fire, by discharging his own piece. It was followed, with 
terrible effect, by a volley from his whole party. 

Nothing could exceed the apparent consternation occa- 
sioned by this well-concerted attack, and the inextricable 
confusion into which the fleet was thrown. Scarcely a 
bullet failed to find its victim, amidst the dense mass of the 
enemy beneath, whose return fire was little better than 
wasted on an invisible foe. The carnage continued for 
some time, when Molang, perceiving, from the fire of his 
assailants, that their numbers were small, detached a party 
to effect a landing below, and attack them in the rear. 
The movement was instantly perceived and frustrated by 
Putnam, who sent the brave Lieutenant Durkee, with 
twelve men, to prevent their landing. He arrived in good 
time, and drove them back with loss. Another small 



SUCCESSFUL RETREAT. 85 

detachment, under Lieutenant Parsons, was ordered up 
the creek, to prevent any similar attempt in that direction. 

Meanwhile, Major Putnam, whose party, in the absence 
of these two detachments, was reduced to twenty, kept up, 
through the whole night, an incessant and deadly fire on 
the main body of the enemy, without the loss of a single 
man on his part. After day-break, he was advised that a 
party of the enemy had effected a landing, at a considera- 
ble distance below, and were rapidly advancing to cut off 
his retreat. His numbers being far inferior to those of the 
French, and his ammunition being almost exhausted, he 
ordered a hasty retreat, which was successfully accom- 
plished. 

During this long-continued action, in which the Ame- 
ricans had slain at least five times their own number, only 
two of their party, a Provincial and an Indian, were 
wounded. These were sent off for the camp, under cover 
of the night, with two men to assist them, and with direc- 
tions to proceed by way of Wood Creek, as the safest, 
though not the shortest route. But, having taken a nearer 
way, they were pursued and overtaken by the Indians ; 
who judged from the blood on the leaves, that they were 
on the trail of the whole party. When they were over- 
taken, the wounded, despairing of mercy at the hands of 
their pursuers, and unable to fly, insisted that their com- 
rades, who were unhurt, should make their escape 
which, on a moment's deliberation, they effected. The 
Provincial, whose thigh had been broken by a ball, resolv- 
ing to sell his life as dearly as possible, fired his piece 
upon toe approach of the savages, and killed three of 
them ; after which he was quickly despatched. The 
Indian, making no resistance, was made a prisoner. 

This tndian Major Putnam afterward saw while he was 
a. prisoner in Canada, and learned from him that 



86 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

the number of the enemy in this encounter was five hun- 
dred, of whom fully one half were slain. 

His brave little band, now reduced to forty, had pro- 
ceeded along the bank of the creek a few miles, when 
Major Putnam, who, as usual, was in front of his men, 
was fired upon by a party near at hand. Not doubting 
that it was a party of his late antagonists, who had stolen 
the march upon him and headed him off, and feeling that 
nothing would be lost in assuming a bold countenance in 
so critical a position, he ordered his men to rush upon the 
enemy, promising soon to give as good an account of them, 
as of those whom they had just encountered at the creek. 
No sooner was his voice heard in the charge, than an 
instant reply, " Hold ! we are all friends ! " arrested his 
hostile movement, and brought his men, with their bayo- 
nets poised, ard their feet firmly planted for an onset, to a 
dead halt. A scouting party- of Provincials from Fort 
Edward immediately joined them. " We are friends, 
Major," exclaimed the leader, " and supposed we were 
firing upon the French." " Friends or foes," replied Put- 
nam, " you all deserve to be hanged, for not killing more 
when you had so fair a shot." It was indeed wonderful, 
when we consider what expert marksmen most of the 
provincial scouts were, and how completely the unsus- 
pecting Major and his party were exposed to their fire, 
that only one of their number was mortally wounded in 
this encounter. 

In the meantime, one of the soldiers, whose ammunition 
had been early exhausted, had made his way back to 
Fort Edward, conveying tidings of the perilous position of 
the party ; and General Lyman was immediately dispatch- 
ed, at the head of five hundred men, to cover their retreat. 
They met them at the distance of twelve miles from the 
fort, to which they all returned in safety the next day. 



TICONDEROGA THE ARMY IN MOTION. 87 

The most active preparations were now made for an 
assault upon Ticonderoga, which was the strong-hold of 
the French in this part of America. It was an ill-con- 
ducted, ill-starred expedition, which we would fain pass 
over in silence if we could. The site of this fortress is 
surrounded on three sides by water. On the fourth it is 
protected by a loose morass, extending a considerable dis- 
tance. Beyond this, a line of fortification, eight feet high, 
was stretched from water to water, and planted with artil- 
lery. In front of this line, for the distance of one hundred 
yards, the plain was covered with large trees, cut for the 
purpose of defence, and arranged with their interwoven 
and sharpened branches projecting outwards. These im- 
pediments, it would seem, were quite sufficient to prevent 
any prudent commander from attempting to carry the 
works by storm. The ground was impracticable for the 
movement of heavy cannon ; and the engineer, who was 
employed to reconnoitre the position, reported that the 
defences might be carried with musketry. The adoption 
of this shallow advice was precipitated by the rumor, that 
the garrison, consisting of over five thousand men, was on 
the point of receiving a large reinforcement, by the recall 
of a party of three thousand who had been detached, on 
other 'service, to the Mohawk River. 

The expedition was led by General Abercrombie in 
person. His force consisted of sixteen thousand men, of 
whom nine thousand were Americans. It was attended 
by a very formidable train of artillery, and an ample supply 
of ammunition and military stores. On the morning of the 
fifth of July, they embarked in one hundred and twenty- 
five whale-boats, and nine hundred batteaux, and moved 
slowly, and in admirable order, down Lake George ; pre- 
senting a brilliant and imposing spectacle, never before 
seen on these quiet waters. At evening they reached 



88 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Sabbath-day Point a place already rendered memorable 
by Putnam's successful rencontre with his pursuers. 
Here they halted a few hours for refreshment, and then 
resumed their voyage. Being informed that the place 
where they first proposed to land was in possession of the 
enemy, they bent their course for another, where they 
effected a landing without opposition. 

It was now noon of the sixth day of July. The place 
of debarkation was in a cove on the west side of the luke. 
A short distance from this place, the advanced guard of 
the enemy, consisting of one battalion, was posted in a 
logged camp. The troops were immediately formed into 
four columns, and commenced their march upon the ad- 
vanced guard of the French, who made a precipitate 
retreat, after first destroying everything of value in their 
camp. The march was continued towards Ticonderoga, 
with the design of investing the place. But the woods 
being very thick, and some of the guides unskilful, the 
columns were broken, thrown into confusion, and in some 
measure entangled with each other. Major Putnam, 
whose service, as we have before explained, was often 
independent of the main body of the provincial forces, was 
at this time with Lord Howe, in the van of the rio-ht

centre column, assisting to thread the intricacies of the 
forest. As they were moving slowly onward, they heard 
a firing on their left. 

" Putnam," said Lord Howe, " what means that 
firing ?" 

" I know not," he replied, " but, with your lordship's 
leave, I will see." 

" I will accompany you," rejoined the gallant young 
nobleman. 

In vain did the Major attempt to dissuade him, by say- 
ing : " My Lord, if I am killed, the loss of my life will

be of little consequence ; but the preservation of yours is 
of infinite importance to this army." The only answer 
was : 

" Putnam ! your life is as dear to you as mine is to me 
I am determined to go." 

One hundred of the van, under Major Putnam, filed off 
with Lord Howe. They soon fell in with the left flank of 
the enemy's advanced guard, which, in retreating from 
its late position on the lake, had lost its way in the 
woods, and were now skirmishing with our left. An 
engagement immediately took place. Though it issued in 
great loss to the French, its commencement was attended 
with an irreparable disaster to the British and American 
cause, which was ominous of the fate of the expedition. 
Lord Howe fell at the first charge. 

The army could not have sustained a heavier loss. He 
was in the prime of manhood, of a fine person, and a win- 
ning address, eminent for manly virtue, and distinguished 
for every amiable accomplishment. He had already ac- 
quired an enviable military fame, which gave the most 
brilliant promise for the future. No British officer was 
ever employed in America, who had, in so short a time, 
endeared himself so universally to the Provincial troops, 
or won so extensively the esteem and confidence of the 
people. From his first arrival in the country, he had ac- 
commodated himself, in all respects, to the peculiar nature of 
the service, and to the customs of his New England friends. 
An example to the officer, a friend of the soldier, a model 
of military order and discipline, h^ had freely encountered 
every hazard, and shared in all the hardships of the cam- 
paign. His death was bewailed as a public loss. 

His fall was immediately avenged by his exasperated 
troops, with Putnam at their head, who charged the enemy 
with desperate intrepidity, broke through their rauLs,

where they were joined by several small parties of the 
Provincials, and attacked them again furiously in the rear. 
Three hundred of the enemy were killed, and one hundred 
and forty-eight made prisoners, among whom were five 
officers and three cadets. This retrograde movement 
brought them directly upon the front of the left wing of 
their own army, who, seeing them advancing rapidly over 
the bodies of the slain, supposed them to be French, and 
opened upon them a brisk and heavy fire, by which one 
sergeant and several privates were killed. They might 
thus have been cut in pieces by their own friends, had not 
Putnam, hazarding his own life, to save those of his com- 
rades, rushed in the face of the flying balls, and showing 
himself to his friends, put a stop to their work of slaughter. 

No farther progress was made on this day. The ad- 
vanced parties of the American army were called in, and 
the French kept themselves closely within their entrench- 
ments. 

Putnam remained on the field while the light lasted, 
employed in administering to the comfort of such of the 
wounded among the enemy, as could not be immediately 
removed. He furnished them with such refreshments as 
he could procure, supplied them with blankets, and offer- 
ing them a soldier's sympathy, assured them they should 
be taken to the camp on the following day, and be cared 
tor as friends, for an enemy disarmed and disabled is an 
enemy no longer. 

On the morning of the seventh, the Americans were again 
in motion, and, pushing forward, encamped at the Saw 
Mills, about two miles from the fort. They were nearly four 
times in number to that of the enemy. There can be little 
doubt, if they had proceeded at once to the assault, with- 
out giving time for the extension of the formidable abatlis, 
by which Montcalm had now bristled the entire space in 



BATTLE OF TICONDEROGA 91 

front of his lines, they would have brought the campaign 
to a successful issue. Instead of this, however, they de- 
layed their movements till these works were completed ; 
which, while they rendered useless the heavy train of 
English artillery, formed impenetrable barriers to the order- 
ly advance of the infantry. 

The eighth was the fatal day fixed for the assault. Sir 
William Johnson, with a re-inforcement of four hundred 
and forty Indians, arrived in the camp at sunrise. At 
seven o'clock, the movement of the army commenced, 
being slightly impeded by a brief and unfruitful skirmish, 
between the rangers and a party of the enemy in ambush. 
These being dispersed, and the advance-guard driven in, a 
general assault was made upon the works, soon after ten. 
Notwithstanding the height of the breast-work, and the 
obstacles arising from the peculiar character of the de- 
fences, an attempt was made to scale it. This perilous 
service was led by Major Proby, who fell, in the first 
onset, within a few yards of the works. The attempt to 
carry them by storm was repeated several times during 
four hours, attended with a tremendous loss on the part 
of the assailants. The enemy, securely entrenched be- 
hind their fortifications, suffered comparatively little. 

Finding that the works could not be carried by light- 
armed troops, and the nature of the ground precluding the 
possibility of bringing the heavy artillery to bear, a retreat 
was ordered, and further operations against this post aban- 
doned. Major Putnam, who had acted as Aid in bringing 
the Provincial regiments successively to action, assisted, 
with his usual coolness and intrepidity, in covering the 
retreat, that being the post of danger, and the one to which 
he was generally assigned. 

Considering all the circumstances, this defeat was as 
disgraceful to General Abercrombie, as it was disastrous 



92 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

to his army. The attack, though bravely attempted and 
boldly sustained by the soldiers, was ill-concerted and ill- 
timed. It was delayed until the French defences were 
completed ; and then abandoned, when the numbers of the 
assailants were more than double those of the enemy, and 
amply provided with all the means for investing the fortress, 
cutting off all communication with the surrounding coun- 
try, and so reducing it by famine, without the necessity of 
hazarding a battle on such unequal terms. Had the con- 
duct of this expedition been committed to American offi- 
cers, it would probably have terminated as fatally to Mont- 
calm, as his own assault upon Fort William Henry, in the 
previous campaign, had done to the English ; though it 
would not, like that, have been followed by a treacherous 
massacre of an unarmed and surrendered garrison. 

There fell in this disastrous assault, of the British regu- 
lars, four hundred and sixty-four killed, and eleven hun- 
dred and seventeen wounded ; of the Provincials, eighty- 
seven killed, and two hundred and thirty-nine wounded ; 
thirty-seven more were missing making a total of nine- 
teen hundred and forty-four. The loss of the French 
did not much exceed five hundred.

IN the course of this season several remarkable adventures 
occurred to our hero, in which the public interests were 
little concerned, but which are still worthy of record, as 
illustrating the character of the man, and the vicissitudes 
of the service. 

One day, as Major Putnam chanced to be with a few- 
men in his boat, on the eastern shore of the Hudson, very 
near the head of the rapids at Fort Miller, he was suddenly 
warned from the opposite shore, that a large number of 
Indians were close in his rear, and would be upon him in 
an instant. To remain where he was and be sacrificed 
to attempt crossing the river exposed to the almost unerr- 
ing rifles of the Indians or to go down the falls, with an 



94 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

almost certainty of being dashed on the rocks and drowned 
were the only alternatives left to his choice. The In- 
dians arrived at the shore, in season to fire a number of 
balls at the bateau, before it could be fairly got under way. 
One man, who, being at a little distance from his party on 
shore, had not time to reach the boat, was instantly seized 
and killed. No sooner had the bateau men, by favor of 
the rapidity of the current, escaped beyond the reach of 
musket shot, than death seemed only to have been avoided 
in one form, to be encountered in another no less terrible. 
Prominent rocks, latent shelves, and abrupt descents, for 
near a quarter of a mile, afforded scarcely the smallest 
chance of escaping without a miracle. 

Putnam trusting himself to a Providence, whose kind- 
ness he had often experienced, rather than to men, whose 
tender mercy is cruelty, was now seen to place himself 
calmly at the helm, affording an astonishing spectacle of 
serenity. His companions, with a mixture of terroi, 
admiration, and wonder, saw him incessantly changing 
his course, to avoid the jaws of ruin that seemed to expand 
to swallow the whirling boat. Twice he turned it quite 
round to shun the rifts of rocks. Amidst those eddies in 
which there was the greatest danger of its foundering, at 
one moment the sides were exposed to the fury of the 
waves ; then the stern, and next the bow glanced obliquely 
onward, with inconceivable velocity. With no less 
amazement, the gazing savages beheld him sometimes 
mounting the billows, then plunging abruptly down ; at 
other times dexterously veering from the rocks, and shoot- 
ing through the only narrow passage ; until at last they 
viewed the boat safely gliding on the smooth surface of 
the stream below ! At this extraordinary sight, it is said 
that these rude sons of nature were affected with the same 
kind of superstitious veneration which tha Europeans in 



HANGING 95 

the dark ages entertained for some of their most valiant 
champions. They regarded him as possessed of " a 
charmed life," and conceived it would be a sin against the 
Great Spirit to attempt to kill him with powder and ball, 
if they should ever recognise him at a future period. 
It will be seen, in the sequel, that some others of the same 
race were not affected by their impressions, or not dispos- 
ed to push these superstitious scruples so far, as to deny 
themselves the satisfaction of trying the efficacy of the 
tomahawk, and subjecting him to the ordeal of fire. 

In the month of August, Major Putnam \vas deserted by 
the good fortune which had hitherto attended him, and 
made the subject of a series of adventures and perils, 
which seem, in many particulars, more like romance, than 
a sober tale of real life. A train of baggage teams having 
been cut off by a large party of the enemy's rangers, a 
corps of about eight hundred men, under the command of 
Majors Rogers and Putnam,* was dispatched to head the 
party, and cut it off. So rapid was the retreat, however, 
that the enemy had reached their canoes, and embarked, 
before their pursuers could come up with them ; though 
they were not so far in advance but that their shouting 
was heard in the distance. 

Defeated in this expedition, the party was now separat- 
ed into two equal divisions, Rogers taking his station with 
one half, at South Bay, and Putnam, with the. other, at 
Wood Creek, twelve miles distant. It was their hope to 
surprise some straggling party of the enemy, or in some 
other way retaliate upon them the loss they had just expe- 
rienced. But, being discovered by the enemy's scouts, 
they deemed it expedient to re-unite their forces at Wood 
Creek, and return without delay to head-quarters, at Fort 
Edward. Their march was a difficult one, through thick 

* Holmes' Orderly Book. 



96 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

woods rendered almost impassable by fallen trees, and a 
thrifty undergrowth. They were obliged to advance in 
Indian file, Putnam in the van, Captain Dalyell in the 
centre, and Rogers bringing up the rear. The firstnight, 
they encamped on the bank of Clear River, not far from 
the site of the old Fort Anne. 

The next morning, before resuming their march, Major 
Rogers, with a singular forgetfulness of those precautions 
to which rangers are often indebted, for success in their 
enterprises, and security to their persons, amused himself 
by a trial of skill with a British officer, in firing at a mark, 
an act of fool-hardy imprudence, which was followed 
by the loss of many valuable lives. 

Immediately on the discovery of the two parties at South 
Bay and Wood Creek, the celebrated French partizan, 
Molang, was detached from Ticonderoga, with five hun- 
dred men, to intercept them. He was now so near their 
encampment, that the report of this firing reached his 
ears, and guided him at once to their position. Availing 
himself skilfully of this gratuitous information, he hastened 
to lay an ambuscade in thart part of the wood through 
which his enemy was to pass, where he could do the 
most damage to them, with the least damage to himself. 

The march having proceeded about a mile, from their 
encampment, Major Putnam was about emerging from the 
thicket into the common forest, when the enemy, starting 
up from his ambush, with horrid yells and discordant 
whoops, commenced a furious attack upon the right of his 
division.* Putnam was surprised, but not dismayed. 
He returned the fire of his assailants, with his accustomed 
spirit, and immediately passed the word for the other 

* The incidents of this engagement, and of the captivity of Put- 
nam, are given, with a few verbal alterations, in the language of 
Colonel Humphreys. 



CAPTURED BY AN INDIAN. 97 

divisions to advance to his support. Dalyell moved rapidly 
up, and a brisk engagement commenced. Though the 
action was widely scattered, and principally between man 
and man, it soon grew general and intensely warm. Ro- 
gers did not come up with Dalyell, but, as he afterward 
declared, formed a circular file between the other two 
divisions and the creek, so as to prevent their being taken 
in the rear, or enfiladed. It was a singular movement in 
one, who, according to his own journal, was the master- 
spirit of the expedition ; and, though not censured by his 
superiors, did not escape the imputation, in the army, of 
being instigated by an unworthy motive. 

Putnam, finding that it would be impracticable to cross 
the creek, determined to maintain his ground. Inspired 
by his example, the officers and men behaved with great 
bravery, sometimes fighting in masses, in open view, with 
as much order as the nature of the ground would allow, 
and then individually and under cover, after the Indian 
fashion, each one sheltering himself behind a tree, and act- 
ing in a manner independent of his party. For himself, 
having discharged his fusee several times, it at length 
missed fire, while the muzzle was pressed against the 
breast of a large and powerful Indian. This warrior, avail- 
ing himself of the unprotected attitude of his adversary, 
with a tremendous war-whoop, sprang forward, with his 
lifted hatchet, and compelled him to surrender. He was 
immediately disarmed and bound to a tree, while his cap- 
tor returned to t.he battle. 

Notwithstanding the capture of their bravest officer, the 
engagement was continued by the resolute men under 
Captains Dalyell and Harman. But their numbers being 
greatly inferior to their adversaries, they were forced to 
give ground for a few moments. The savages, conceiving 
this to be the commencement of a retreat, immediately 
G 



98 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

made a new and impetuous onset, with redoubled cries, as 
if sure of victory. It was a momentary advantage which 
ihey gained. Our intrepid partizans having collected 
together a handful of brave men, gave their pursuers such 
a warm reception, that they, in their turn, were forced 
back beyond the ground upon which the action com- 
menced. This movement brought the tree to which 
Putnam was bound directly between the fire of the two 
parties. It is scarcely possible to imagine a more despe- 
rate situation ; a mark alike for every random shot of . 
friends or foes. The balls flew incessantly from either 
side. Many struck the tree, while some passed through 
the sleeves and skirts of his coat. So equally balanced 
and so obstinate was the fight, that he was kept in this 
trying situation more than an hour. During this time, he 
was twice exposed to the mischievous malice of his un- 
feeling enemies. A young Indian warrior coming up, and 
seeing the white chief confined in that awkward position, 
hurled a tomahawk several times at his head ; rather 
as if he were amusing himself with a mark, than with any 
settled purpose to despatch his victim. So unerring was 
the savage's aim, that the weapon several times grazed 
his skin, and stuck in the tree by the side of his head. 

When the young savage had satisfied himself with this 
amusement, one of the inferior French officers came up, 
and levelling his musket at his breast, attempted to dis- 
charge it. It missed fire. In vain did the intended victim 
of his malice solicit the treatment due to his situation, by 
declaring that he was a prisoner of war. The degenerate 
Frenchman did not understand the language of honor or 
of nature. Deaf to their voice, and dead to sensibility, he 
violently and repeatedly pushed the muzzle of his gun 
against Putnam's rib&, and finally gave him a cruel blow 
on the jaw with the butt-end of his piece, and left him. 



SEVERELY USED AND TORTURED. 99 

At length the active intrepidity of Dalyell and Harman, 
seconded by the persevering valor of their followers, pre- 
vailed. They drove from the field the enemy, who left 
about ninety dead behind him. As they were retiring, 
Putnam was untied by the Indian who had made him 
prisoner, and whom he sometimes called master. Having 
been conducted a considerable distance from the place of 
action, he was stripped of his coat, vest, stockings and 
shoes ; loaded with as many of the packs of the wounded 
,as could be piled upon him, strongly pinioned, and his 
wrists held together as closely as they could be pulled by 
a cord. After he had marched in this painful manner for 
many tedious miles, through unpleasant paths, the fatigued 
party halted to breathe. His hands were now immode- 
rately swelled from the tightness of the ligature, and the 
pain had become intolerable. His feet were severely 
scratched, so that the blood flowed freely from them. Ex- 
hausted with bearing a 'burden above his strength, and 
frantic with torments exquisite beyond endurance, he 
entreated the Irish interpreter to implore, as the last and 
only grace he desired of his captors, that they would 
knock him on the head and take his scalp at once, or loose 
his hands. A French officer, instantly interposing, order- 
ed his hands to be unbound, and some of the packs to be 
taken off. By this time the Indian who captured him, and 
who had been absent with the wounded, coming up, gave 
him a pair of moccasins, and expressed great indignation 
at the unworthy treatment his prisoner had received. 

That chief, being obliged again to return to the care 
of the wounded, the Indians, about two hundred in num- 
ber, went on before the rest of the party to the place 
where the whole were that night to encamp. They took 
with them Major Putnam, on whom, besides innume- 
rable other outrages, they had the barbarity to inflict a 



100 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

deep wound with a tomahawk in the left cheek.* His 
sufferings were in this place to be consummated. A scene 
of horror, infinitely greater than had ever met his eyes be- 
fore, was preparing. It was determined to roast him alive. 
For this purpose they led him into a dark forest, stripped 
him naked, bound him to a tree, and piled dry brush, with 
other fuel, at a small distance in a circle around him. 
They accompanied their labors, as if for his funeral dirge ; 
with screams and sounds inimitable but by savage voices. 
Then they set the pile on fire. A sudden shower damped 
the rising flames. Still they strove to kindle it, until at 
last the blaze ran fiercely round the circle. Major Putnam 
soon began to feel the scorching heat. His hands were so 
tied that he could move his body. He often shifted sides 
as the fire approached. This sight, at the very idea of 
which all but savages must shudder, afforded the highest 
diversion to his inhuman tormentors, who demonstrated the 
delirium of their joy by correspondent yells, dances and 
gesticulations. He saw that his final hour was inevitably 
come. He summoned all his resolution, and composed 
his mind, as far as the circumstances would admit, to bid 
an eternal farewell to all he held most dear. To quit the 
world would scarcely have cost a single pang, but for the 
idea of home but for the remembrance of domestic en- 
dearments, of the affectionate partner of his soul, and of 
their beloved offspring. His thought was ultimately fixed 
on a happier state of existence, beyond the tortures he was 
beginning to endure, The bitterness of death, even of 
that death, which is accompanied with the keenest agonies, 
was, in a manner, past and all the concerns of time seemed 

* Rev. Dr. Holmes, in his Annals of America, speaking of 
this incident, says : " A deep scar on the cheek of that veteran war- 
rior (Putnam) is well remembered by the writer, who believes it was 
from the wound inflicted by the tomahawk." Annals, Vol. ii., p. 523. 



AN UNCOMFORTABLE NIGHT. 101 

as nothing in the near view of eternity when a French 
officer rushed through the crowd, opened a way by scat* 
tering the brands, and unbound the victim. It was Mo- 
lang himself; to whom an Indian, unwilling to witness the 
immolation of another human sacrifice, had run and com- 
municated the tidings. That commandant spurned and 
severely reprimanded the barbarians, whose nocturnal 
pow-wows and hellish orgies he suddenly ended. Put- 
nam did not want for feeling or gratitude. The French 
commander, fearing to trust him alone with them, remain- 
ed until he could deliver him in safety into the hands of 
his master. 

The savage approached his prisoner kindly, and seemed 
to treat him with particular affection. He offered him 
some hard biscuits, but finding that he could not chew 
them, on account of the blow he had received from the 
Frenchman, and the wound of the tomahawk, this more 
humane savage soaked some of the biscuit in water, till 
it was sufficiently soft to be swallowed without effort 
Determined, however, not to loose his captive, though he 
was willing to treat him kindly, he took the moccasins 
from his feet, and tied them to one of his wrists ; then di- 
recting him to lie down upon his back on the bare ground, 
he stretched one arm to its full length, and bound it fast to 
a young tree ; the other arm was extended and bound in 
the same manner ; his legs were stretched apart, and fas- 
tened to two saplings. Then a number of tall but slender 
poles were cut down, which, with some long bushes, were 
laid across his body from head to foot ; on each side lay 
as many Indians as could conveniently find lodging, in 
order to prevent the possibility of his" escape. In this dis- 
agreeable and painful posture he remained until morning. 
During this night, the longest and most dreary conceivable, 
our hero used to relate that he felt a ray of cheerfulness 



102 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

come casually across his mind, and could not even refrain 
from smiling, when he reflected on this ludicrous group 
for a painter, of which he himself was the principal figure. 

The next day he was allowed his blanket and moccasins, 
and permitted to march without carrying any pack, or 
receiving any insult. To allay his extreme hunger, a little 
bear's meat was given, which he sucked through his teeth. 
At night, the party arrived at Ticonderoga, and the pri- 
soner was placed under the care of a French guard. The 
savages, who had been prevented from glutting their diabo- 
lical thirst for blood, took other opportunity of manifesting 
their malevolence for the disappointment, by horrid gri- 
maces and angry gestures ; but they were suffered no more 
to offer violence or personal indignity to him. 

After having been examined by the Marquis de Mont- 
calm, Major Putnam was conducted to Montreal by a 
French officer, who treated him with the greatest indul- 
gence and humanity. 

At this place there were at this time several pri- 
soners. Colonel Schuyler, remarkable for his philanthropy, 
generosity and friendship, was one of the number. No 
sooner had he heard of Major Putnam's arrival, than he 
went to the interpreter's quarters, and inquired whether 
he had a Provincial Mnjor in his custody. He found 
Major Putnam in a comfortless condition without coat, 
waistcoat or hose ; the remnant of his clothing miserably 
dirty and ragged ; his beard long and squalid ; his legs 
torn by thorns and briars ;' his face gashed with wounds, 
and swollen with bruises. Colonel Schuyler, irritated 
beyond all sufferance at such a sight, could scarcely re- 
strain his speech within limits, consistent wiih the pru- 
dence of a prisoner, and the meekness of a Christian. On 
his remonstrance, Major Putnam was immediately treated 
according to his rank. He was also clothed in a decent 



KINDNESS OF COL. SCHUYLER. 103 

manner, and supplied with money, by that liberal and sym- 
pathizing patron of the distressed. 

While on this dismal journey an attempt was made to 
try the strength of Putnam's nerves. Exhausted with the 
tedious march of the previous day, he was sleeping soundly 
on the bare earth, some time after the remainder of the 
party had shaken off their slumbers, and were preparing 
for a new start. A proposition was made to frighten the 
Major. Accordingly a musket was loaded with a double 
charge, faithfully rammed home, placed within an inch of 
his head as he lay, and discharged. Instead, however, of 
starting suddenly up, and staring wildly round, to see what 
might be the matter, he just muttered out, " That's a good 
one," turned on the other side, and adjusted himself for 
another nap. 

The capture of Frontenac, by Colonel Bradstreet, 
afforded occasion for an exchange of prisoners. Colonel 
Schuyler was comprehended in the cartel. A generous 
spirit can never be satisfied with imposing tasks for its 
generosity to accomplish. Apprehensive, if it should be 
known that Putnam was a distinguished partisan, that his 
liberation might be retarded, and knowing that there were 
officers who, from the greater length of their captivity, had 
claims of priority to exchange, he had, by his happy ad- 
dress, induced the governor to offer, that whatever officer 
he might think proper to nominate should be included in 
the present cartel. With great politeness in manner, but 
seeming indifference as to objects, he expressed his warm- 
est acknowledgments to the governor, and said, " There is 
an old man here, who is a Provincial Major. He is very f 
desirous to be at home with his wife and children. He 
can do no good here, or anywhere else. I believe your 
Excellency had better keep so m- of the young men, who 
have no wives or children to care for, and let this old fel- 



104 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

low go home with me. 7 ' It was a well-managed artifice, 
and had the desired effect. Putnam was immediately 
released, and left Montreal, in company with his generous 
friend, who procured his enlargement. 

At the house of Colonel Schuyler, in Montreal, Major 
Putnam became acquainted with Mrs. Howe, the story of 
whose captivity and sufferings among the Indians, full of 
the most thrilling romance, is familiar to American readers. 
By the payment of a considerable sum of money, Colonel 
Schuyler obtained the release of this lady, and undertook 
to escort her in safety to her friends in New England. He 
also interested himself in behalf of her children, who were 
also in captivity, and did not remit his exertions, until they 
were all at liberty. Business having made it necessary 
that Colonel Schuyler should entrust his charge to other 
hands, he committed her to the protection of his friend 
Putnam, from whom she received those kind attentions by 
the way, which her forlorn condition, and the difficult cha- 
racter of the roads, rendered necessary and acceptable.

these advances, there was no opportunity for the usual 
stirring detail of partizan adventure. There is, therefore, 
little to relate of the subject of this work. He was raised, 
during this year, to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel ; was 
present at the occupation of both the above named for- 
tresses ; and was afterward employed in superintending 
the parties, which were detached to procure timber, and 
other materials, for strengthening the defences at Crown

In opening the campaign of 1760, General Amherst 
found himself in possession of the most important posts 
which the French had hitherto occupied in America ; and 
resolved, in obedience to instructions, to attempt the im- 
mediate and entire annihilation of that power in Canada. 
The Marquis de Vaudreuil, who was in command at Mon- 
treal, applied himself diligently to strengthen the fortifica- 
tions of that place ; and determined, if possible, to make a 
final stand against the further progress of the English 
For this purpose, he called in all his detachments, and 
collected around him the entire force of the colony. His 
resolution was vain. The British general, having but one 
point on which to concentrate his forces, very wisely and 
humanely prepared to collect them all at that point, in 
hopes, by compelling an immediate surrender, to secure a 
bloodless victory. For this purpose, three armies were 
directed to proceed by different routes, and appear at the 
same moment before Montreal. General Murray, with 
the corps which had been commanded by the victorious 
Wolfe, was ordered to ascend the St. Lawrence from Que- 
bec. Colonel Haviland, at the head of another division, 
sailed from Crown Point, by way of Isle-aux-Noix 
which was evacuated by the enemy on his approach. 
General Amherst, with the remainder of the forces, con- 
sisting of about ten thousand regulars and provincials, 
passing up the valley of the Mohawk, and down the Onei- 
da, advanced to Oswego, where he was joined by one 
thousand Indians of the Six Nations, under Sir William 
Johnson. Embarking, with his entire army, on Lake 
Ontario, and taking in his way the Fort of Isle Eoyale, he 
arrived at Montreal, after a difficult and dangerous passage, 
on the same day that General Murray landed at the same 
place from Quebec. The two generals met with no oppo- 
sition in disembarking their troops ; and by a happy con- 



NEW SPECIES OF NAVAL TACTICS. 107 

currence in the execution of a well-concerted plan, Colo- 
nel Haviland joined them with his detachment the next 
day. 

Lieutenant-Colonel Putnam's regiment formed a part of 
the main division under the general-in-chief. During their 
progress, several incidents occurred, in which his peculiar 
ingenuity, as well as his intrepidity, was put to the test. 
Having entered the St. Lawrence, it was necessary, in 
order not to leave an enemy in their rear, to dislodge the 
garrison at Fort Oswegatchie situated on Isle Royale, at 
the mouth of the Oswegatchie river. 

The approach to this place was guarded by two armed 
vessels of twelve guns each, that kept possession of the 
stream, and rendered it impossible for the British army to 
proceed, as one broadside from these ships would demolish 
their whole fleet of boats. General Amherst was some- 
what disconcerted ; as he must either abandon his boats 
altogether, and proceed by land, or contrive some extra- 
ordinary means to get rid of this formidable adversary. 
While he was pondering what should be done, Colonel 
Putnam came to him, and, pointing to one of them, said : 
*' General, that ship must be taken." 

" Ay," replied Amherst, " I would give the world if she 
were taken." 

u I'll take her, Sir," said Putnam, coolly. 

" How ?" asked Amherst, smiling incredulously. 

" Give me some wedges, a beetle, and a few men of 
my own choosing, and I will soon put her out of your 
way." 

Amherst could not conceive how an armed vessel was 
to be taken by four or five men, with no other arms than 
a beetle and wedges. But he had known something of 
the ingenuity and daring of the provincial Colonel, and his 
skill in executing feats of peculiar difficulty. He was. 



108 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

accordingly, authorized to proceed ; and furnished with 
everything that he desired for his experiment. 

In the darkness of the night, Putnam and his chosen 
few, in a light boat, with muffled oars, stole unperceived 
under the vessel's stern, and drove the wedges so firmly 
between the rudder and the stern-post, as to render the 
rudder quite immovable. They then effected their 
escape, in the same stealthy manner as they had come. 
Deprived of her helm, the ship was left at the mercy of 
the winds and the stream, and was soon driven ashore. 
In this condition she offered no resistance to the British 
arms, but struck her colors at the first summons. Her 
companion followed her example without delay, so that 
this victory was won without the loss of a man, or the 
firing of a gun, on either side. 

This incident is found in- "Almorfs Impartial Remem- 
brancer ," published in London in 1775, thirteen years before 
the appearance of Colonel Humphreys' Life of Putnam. 
That work represents the French as voluntarily running 
one of their vessels ashore on the approach of the British. 
Other historians* of the day have said, that one of the 
vessels having accidentally run ashore, the other was 
easily overcome, &c. While Knox, and after him, Mante, 
give all the credit of the adventure to a Col. Williamson, 
of the British army. From the incident of the wedging 
of the rudder being published at so early a date, and on 
British authority, it is most probable that the anecdote is 
true in all its particulars that Putnam first procured one 
of the vessels to be disabled, and that then the thousand 
men, under the command of Col. Williamson, joined him, 
and followed up the work. No man in his senses would 
think of approaching an armed vessel by daylight, with a 
view to get under her stern, and unship or otherwise 
* Marshall, and others. 



DISCREPANCIES RECONCILED. 109 

destroy her rudder. The probable truth, therefore, is, 
that one vessel being disabled, the other yielded readily, 
as all accounts agree in stating. In this manner they are 
all easily reconciled, and the whole credit of the success 
placed where it belongs, to the ingenuity and daring of 
Putnam as Humphreys understood and intended it should 
be ; while he completely defeats that intention, by running 
the two parts of the story into one, and so leaving the main 
incident out of sight. It affords another illustration of the 
modesty of Putnam, and the little account he made of 
his own acts, in detailing to his biographer the movements 
of the army. The following is Colonel Humphreys' ac- 
count of the matter ; which briefly describes the onset of 
the boats, and the sudden surrender of the panic-struck 
enemy, without detailing the circumstances, which made 
that surrender unavoidable. 

"Two armed vessels obstructed the passage, and pre- 
vented the attack. Putnam, with one thousand men, un- 
dertook to board them. This dauntless officer, ever spar- 
ing of the blood of others, as prodigal of his own, to accom- 
plish it with less loss, put himself, with a chosen crew, a 
beetle and wedges, in the van, with a design to wedge the 
rudders, so that the vessels should not be able to turn their 
broadsides, or perform any other manoeuvre. All the men 
in his little fleet were ordered to strip to their waistcoats, 
and advance at the same time. He promised, if he lived, 
to join them, and show the way up the sides. Animated 
by so daring an example, they moved swiftly, and in pro 
found silence, as to certain victory or death. The people 
on board the ships, beholding the good countenance with 
which they approached, ran one of the vessels on shore, 
and struck the colors of the otheF. Had it not been for 
the dastardly conduct of the ship's company'in the latter, 

who compelled the captain to haul down his ensign, he 



110 LIFE OF GENERAL PU7NAM. 

would have given the assailants a bloody reception ; for 
the vessels were well provided with spars, nettings, and 
every customary instrument of annoyance as well as 
defence." 

It was now determined to attack the fortress, which 
the enemy supposed they had rendered inaccessible by a 
high abattis of black-ash, that everywhere projected over 
the water. Lieutenant-Colonel Putnam proposed a mode 
of attack, and offered his services to carry it into effect. 
The proposal was approved of by the general ; and Put- 
nam, accordingly, caused a sufficient number of boats to 
be fitted for the enterprise. The sides of each boat were 
surrounded with fascines, musket proof, which covered 
the men completely. A wide plank, twenty feet long, 
was then fitted to every boat in such a manner, by having 
an angular piece sawed from one extremity, that, when 
fastened by ropes on both sides of the boat, it might be 
raised or lowered at pleasure. The design was, that the 
plank should be held erect while the oarsmen forced the 
bow, with the utmost exertion, against the abattis ; and 
that afterwards being dropped on the pointed brush, it 
should serve as a kind of bridge to assist the men in pass- 
ing over them. Lieutenant-Colonel Putnam, having made 
his dispositions to attempt the escalade in many places at 
the same moment, advanced with his boats in admirable 
order. The garrison, perceiving these extraordinary and 
unexpected machines, did not wait the assault, but capitu- 
lated. Putnam was particularly honored by General 
Amherst, for his ingenuity in this invention, and for his 
promptitude in its execution. 

The three armies arrived at Montreal within two days 
of each other. The Marquis de Vaudreuil, seeing that 
resistance to forces so far superior to his own would be 
worse than useless, proposed an instant capitulation. With 



EXPEDITION TO HAVANA. Ill 

Montreal, Detroit, Michilimakinak, and all other French 
posts on the lakes, were surrendered to the English ; and 
the conquest of Canada was thus completed, without the 
loss of a single drop of blood. 

At the Indian village called Cochnawaga, a short dis- 
tance from Montreal, Putnam saw the savage who had 
made him prisoner in the previous campaign. The Indian 
was highly delighted to see his old acquaintance, whom 
he entertained in his own well-built stone house with 
great friendship and hospitality ; while his guest showed 
no less satisfaction in having an opportunity of shaking the 
brave savage by the hand, and proffering him protection in 
this reverse of his military fortunes. 

The year 1762 found England in rather a gloomy situa- 
tion. The previous campaign had left her much exhaust- 
ed, and Spain, as well as the majority of the other powers 
of Europe, combined against her and Prussia. In the 
event that she should be much farther reduced, the Ame- 
ricans could apprehend nothing less than a speedy and 
energetic attempt by France to recover the lands which 
she had lost during the past years of the war. The colo- 
nies, therefore, were called upon to raise supplies, and 
prepare for a desperate struggle. Large bounties were 
offered by England to those who would enlist under her 
standard which were doubled by the continental author- 
ities. , 

In the meantime, a large army of British and provincials, 
under Admiral Rodney and General Monckton, had sailed 
for Martinique, an island in the West Indies, belonging to 
the French. On the 14th of February, 1762, that island 
was captured. This success was soon followed by the 
subjugation of all the Caribbees. Another powerful expe- 
dition was also sent, the same season, against Havana. It 
consisted of 10,000 men, thirty-seven ships of war, and 



112 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

nearly 150 transports, under the command of Admiral 
Pococke and Lord Albemarle. These landed safely on 
the 17th of June ; but being foiled in all their attempts 
against the fortresses, the climate destroyed a great num- 
ber of them, so that, in less than two months, their numbers 
were reduced about one half. 

At this gloomy crisis aid arrived from the colonies. A 
body of Provincials, composed of five hundred men from 
the Jerseys, eight hundred from New York, and one thou- 
sand from Connecticut, were sent to reinforce his Lord- 
ship. General Lyman, who raised this regiment of one 
thousand men in Connecticut, being the senior officer, was 
appointed to the command of the whole, consequently the 
immediate command of his regiment devolved upon Lieut- 
enant-Colonel Putnam. The fleet, in which these men 
embarked, sailed from New York, and ultimately arrived 
safely in Cuba, though not without perilous accidents by 
the way. 

While on the coast of that island a terrible storm arose, 
and the transport, in which Lieutenant-Colonel Putnam 
had embarked with five hundred men, was wrecked on a 
reef of craggy rocks. The weather was so tempestuous, 
and the surf, which ran mountain-high, dashed with such 
violence against the ship, that the most experienced sea- 
men expected she would go to pieces. The rest of the 
fleet, so far from being able to afford assistance, with diffi- 
culty rode out the gale. 

In this situation, strict military order was maintained, 
and all those people, who best understood the use of tools, 
were instantly employed in constructing rafts from spars, 
planks, and whatever other materials could be procured. 
Strong lines were secured to each of these rafts, and run 
out from the ship, as they put off towards the land. When 
the first had, with inconceivable hazard and difficulty, 



SHIPWRECK HAVANA REDUCED. 113 

reached the shore, these lines proved of infinite service, 
in preventing the others from driving out to sea, as well 
as in dragging them athwart the billows to the beach, and 
keeping up a constant communication with the ship. By 
these means every man was finally saved. 

As soon as all were landed, Lieutenant-Colonel Putnam 
fortified his camp, that he might not be exposed to injury 
or insult from the inhabitants of the neighboring dis- 
tricts. Here the party remained unmolested several days, 
until the storm had so much abated as to permit the con- 
voy to take them off. They soon joined the troops before 
Havana, who, having been several weeks in that unhealthy 
climate, began to feel its effects severely in the gradual 
reduction of their numbers, and the transformation of their 
camp into a hospital. The opportune arrival of the Pro- 
vincial reinforcement, in perfect health, contributed not a 
little to forward the works which were in progress, and to 
hasten the reduction of that important place. But the 
Provincials suffered so miserably by sickness afterwards, 
that very few of their number ever found their way home 
again. 

The entrance into the harbor of Havana is by a narrow 
channel, the east side of which is secured by a fort of great 
strength, and deemed quite* impregnable, called El Moro. 
The west is protected by another, called ElPunto. Lord 
Albemarle, having command of the land forces, amounting 
to fourteen thousand men, of whom four thousand were 
Provincials, commenced the siege of the Moro. After 
suffering incredible hardships, and surmounting the most 
appalling obstacles, the besiegers obtained possession of 
the covered way, which led to the fortress, made a lodg- 
ment before the right bastion, and sprung a mine, which 
threw down a part of the works, and left open a small 

breach The soldiers, now ordered to storm the place, 
H 



114 LIFE C F GENERAL PUTNAM 

mounted the breach, under command of Lieutenant 
Forbes, supported by Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart, and en- 
tered the fort with such order and intrepidity, as entirely 
disconcerted the garrison. Four hundred Spaniards were 
either cut in pieces, or perished in attempting to escape by 
water to the city. The remainder threw down their arms, 
and received quarter. 

The British troops, now in possession of the castle, and 
having completed their own batteries, on an eminence that 
commanded the city, were enabled to plant sixty pieces 
of cannon in position to play effectively on the place. 
Thus fortified, Lord Albemarle sent a flag of truce, with a 
summons to the governor to surrender. The haughty 
Spaniard replied that he should hold out to the last ex- 
tremity. The batteries, however, were opened with such 
effect the next morning, both against the city and the Pun- 
tal, that a deputy was sent out about noon, to settle the 
terms of capitulation. A cessation of arms immediately 
ensued, and the city of Havana, with a district extending 
one hundred and eighty miles westward, and embracing 
about one fourth part of the island, with the fortresses and 
the ships in the harbor, were surrendered to His Britannic 
Majesty. 

Soon after this event, the combined powers, finding that 
war with Great Britain, whether by land or sea, was only 
a losing game, proposed terms of peace, which removed 
the dark cloud that had so long hung over the prospects 
of the colonies.

TILL the year 1758 or 1759, it seemed doubtful whether 
France or England would have the ascendency in the 
New World ; and in particular, whether the British should 
not be confined to a narrow slip of land on the shores of 
the Atlantic. The superior population and wealth of the 
English colonies, and the immense superiority of the 
British navy over that of France, and particularly the 
energy of Pitt's Administration, turned the scale in favor 
of England. Great joy was diffused throughout the British 
dominions ; but in no place was it felt, in a higher degree, 
or with greater reason, than in America. For one hun- 
dred and fifty years France and England had been con- 
tending for American territory ; and for the last half of 
that period there had been but little intermission of active 
hostilities, or of those irregular border difficulties, which 



116 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

are scarcely less annoying or destructive than actual war. 
There were no precise, well-defined boundaries to the 
possessions of the two nations ; but both were willing to 
enlarge them in any direction. They possessed much, but 
coveted more. Neither was backward to make encroach- 
ments on the other ; and both were prompt to repel them 
when made, or supposed to be made, on themselves. 
Throughout this period, especially the last half of it, in 
addition to the unavoidable calamities of war, indiscrimi- 
nate massacres had been so frequently and extensively 
committed on numerous settlers, dispersed over many 
hundred miles of exposed frontier, that it has been sup- 
posed the British colonies lost in this way not less than 
twenty thousand inhabitants. War assumed a most ter- 
rific aspect among the colonists. Not confined to men in 
arms, as is common in Europe, aged persons, women, and 
children, were frequently its victims. The tomahawk and 
scalping knife, carried to the fire-sides of peaceable, help- 
less families, were applied promiscuously to every age 
and sex. 

It was hoped that the reduction of Canada would close 
these horrid scenes for ever, with respect to the northern 
and middle colonies. As the Indians could in future derive 
supplies from none but the English, and as they would be 
no longer exposed to the seductiveness of French influ- 
ence, it was confidently expected that they would desist 
from their depredations, and leave the colonies to pursue 
the advantages gained in this long and expensive contest. 
In this expectation they were disappointed. Some of the 
Indians laid down their arms, but many of the tribes on 
the western frontiers still continued hostilities not, as be- 
fore, to sustain or restore the French dominion, but appa- 
rently with a view to regain, for themselves, some of that 
ancient power which both the contending parties had com- 



THE INDIAN CONFEDERACY. 117 

bined to wrest from their hands. It is not improbable, 
indeed, that they were instigated in a great measure by the 
catholic priests who still remained among them, and who 
possessed unbounded influence over their minds. 

Even at that early day, however, they seem to have 
had a prophetic intimation of the fate that awaited them, 
from the continual influx and rapid increase of the Euro- 
pean race. The most sagacious of their leaders saw, even 
then, as in a vision, that they had nothing to expect from 
the pale-faced intruders upon their territories but per- 
petual encroachment, treacherous, over-reaching negotia 
tion and diplomacy, and the ultimate extermination of theii 
whole race. In a conference between some of the Ame 
rican governors and the Six Nations, soon after the peace 
of 1761, a warm dispute arose concerning certain lands, 
which the Indians asserted had been seized by some 
English settlers under a fraudulent conveyance. Popula 
tion, too, augmented so rapidly during the interval of 
peace, after England had acquired the mastery of the con 
tinent, that the colonists soon overran their prescribed 
limits ; and, as a chain of forts had been constructed round 
the most important lands of the Indians, they perceived 
that the English, by fate or by design, were about to 
extirpate them, or drive them back upon the distant moun- 
tains of the west. Under these impressions, the truth of 
which has been so signally realized, the Shawanese, the 
Delawares, and the tribes along the Ohio, this side Missis- 
sippi, and about Detroit, concerted a plan, in 1763, to 
attack, at one and the same time, all the English posts and 
settlements in their neighborhood. 

O 

Under Pontiac, the celebrated to way chief, and other 
highly gifted leaders thirty-six of whom were now united 
under this confederacy they succeeded in getting pos- 
session of several important posts, which the French had 



118 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

surrendered, and were proceeding to concentrate a for- 
midable power on the northern lakes. General Amherst, 
who still remained in command, immediately ordered strong 
reinforcements to forts Pitt, Detroit and Niagara those 
of Le Boeuf, Venango, Presque Isle and Michilimacki- 
nack, being already in possession of the Indians. Captain 
Dalyell, of whom we have had occasion to speak in ano- 
ther place as the faithful friend and intrepid fellow-soldier 
of Colonel Putnam, commanded the first party destined for 
Detroit, with orders from General Amherst to raise the 
siege, by dispersing the Indians. On his arrival, he suc- 
ceeded in effecting an entrance into the fortress, without a 

O ' 

conflict with the enemy who invested it. Major Glad- 
wine, who commanded the garrison, satisfied that with 
this reinforcement the place could hold out against the 
besiegers, while they were still too few to hazard an open 
encounter, would fain have dissuaded Captain Dalyell from 
offering them battle. But the latter, relying on the disci- 
pline and courage of his men, replied : " God forbid that I 
should ever disobey the orders of my general," and imme- 
diately disposed them for action. His force consisted of 
only two hundred and fifty men. Those of Pontiac were 
vastly superior in numbers. The conflict, which com- 
menced at two o'clock in the morning, was obstinate and 
bloody. The Indians, on every side, kept up a galling 
fire from behind trees and fences, and threatening to sur- 
round and enclose Captain Dalyell and his party, compelled 
him reluctantly to retreat. Having gained a temporary 
shelter, and halted to breathe, he saw one of his bravest 
sergeants lying on the ground at a little distance, wallow- 
ing in his blood from a severe wound in his thigh, and 
desired some of his men to run to his relief. They declin- 
ed the service, as too hazardous. Dalyell, declaring 
" that he would never leave so brave a soldier in the field, 



COMMANDS A REGIMENT AT DETROIT. 119 

to be tortured by the savages," went alone to his rescue. 
As he was endeavoring to raise the wounded man from the 
ground, a volley from the enemy was poured in upon them, 
and they both fell dead together. How do such acts of 
heroic disinterestedness and self-sacrifice, elevate the cha- 
racter of the true soldier, and eclipse the proudest laurels 
of the mere conqueror ! 

The Indians still maintaining their position, Colonel 
Bradstreet was sent the following year, 1764, with a force 
sufficient to reduce them. To this force Connecticut con- 
tributed a regiment of four hundred men, under the com- 
mand of Putnam who had now received the commission 
of a colonel. The old Indian chief, who has been before 
mentioned as his captor, and whom in that relation he 
had called master, was also on this expedition, at the head 
of a hundred Cochnawaga warriors. He had made peace 
with the English, and was now marching side by side 
with his former prisoner, to fight with the ancient enemy 
of his tribe. Joseph Brant, the celebrated Mohawk chief, 
took part also in this expedition. 

Meanwhile, Detroit continued to be closely blockaded, 
and the garrison suffered extremely from fatigue and the 
want of provisions. On the third of September, a schooner, 
dispatched from Niagara with twelve men and six Mo- 
hawk Indians, with provisions for the relief of the garrison, 
arrived in the river. She was immediately attacked by 
three hundred and fifty Indians in boats, but, by the admi- 
rable skill and bravery of the little band on board, she was 
carried safely into the fort, with the loss of the master and 
one man killed, and four wounded. 

Saved from certain death by this seasonable supply of 
provisions, the garrison held out till the arrival of the 
forces under Colonel Bradstreet. Overawed by the supe- 
rior numbers now arrayed against them, and feeling that 



120 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

all farther efforts would be worse than vain, the Indians 
withdrew, without battle, and proposed conditions of 
peace ; which, after long delays and frequent changes of 
terms, were duly arranged and ratified in the course of the 
following season. 

As this expedition afforded little opportunity for brilliant 
services, or daring achievements, we have nothing to say 
for Colonel Putnam save that, as usual, he was always 
at his post, ready for any service that might be required 
of him, and weary of nothing so much as inaction. The 
following letter, supposed to be the longest he ever wrote, 
will give some idea of the state of the frontier settlements 
at that time, and of the difficulties they had to encounter 
in dealing with the Indians. It was addressed to Major 
Drake, of Norwich, Connecticut, and was published in the 
Boston Gazette, of December 24th, 1764. 

" Camp Sandusky, near the Carrying Place, } 
October 7, 1764. ! 

" DEAR SIR : 

" I can tell you the land here is good enough, and sup- 
pose you will think it strange if I should tell you, that in 
many places in this country, there are ten or twenty thou- 
sand acres of land in a place, that have not a bush or twig 
on them, but all covered with grass, so big and high that 
it is very difficult to travel and all as good plough-land 
as ever you saw ; any of it fit for hemp ; but there are 
too many hemp birds among it, which will make it very 
unhealthy to live among. 

" Detroit is a very beautiful place, and the country 
around it. We sent out an officer, and three Indians, to the 
Delawares and Shawanese from Presque Isle, who returned 
and were illy used. We sent the like number from San- 
dusky, but all before any one returned. 



CAPTAIN KING'S TALK. 121 

" From Sandusky we sent Captain Montieur and Cap- 
tain Peters, from Maumee we sent Captain Morris of the 
17th, and one Thomas King with three Indians. Captain 
Morris returned some time ago, and was much abused, 
and stripped, and whipped, and threatened to be toma- 
hawked, but had his life spared in case he would return. 
Captain Thomas King and three of the Kanawawas pro- 
ceeded. This Captain King is one of the chiefs of the 
Oneida Castle ; and about ten days ago King came into 
Detroit, and had left all the Kanawawas, who gave out for 
want of provisions, and could not travel ; he supposed they 
ail perished in the woods. And three days ago he arrived 
here, and yesterday he had a conference with the Indians ; 
and when all assembled, he made a speech to them. 
After some talk with them, he expressed himself in this 
manner : 

" * Friends and Brothers : I am now about to acquaint 
you with facts, too obvious to deny, I have been, since I 
left you, to Monsieur Pontuck's (Pontiac's) camp, and 
waited on him to see if he was willing to come in, and 
make peace with our brothers, the English. He asked 
me what I meant by all that, saying, " You have always 
encouraged me to carry on the war against the English, 
and said, the only reason you did not join me last year 
was the want of ammunition, and as soon as you could get 
ammunition, you would join me." ' 

" King said there was nothing in it, at which Pontuck 
produced six belts of wampum, that he had had the last 
year from the Six Nations, and said, ' The English are so 
exhausted, they can do no more, and one year's war, well 
pushed, will drive them into the sea.' 

" King then made a stop for some time (when he added), 
' Brothers, you know this to be true, and you have always 
deceived me.' At which the Six Nations were all angry, 
6 



122 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

and this day they are all packing up to go off; and what 
will be the event I don't know, nor don't care, for I have 
no faith in an Indian peace, patched up by presents. 

" Yesterday, Captain Peters arrived, which is the last 
party we had out. Capt. Peters says the Wyandots are all 
coming in ; but the Delawares and the Shawanese are not 
coming, np durst they come, for they are afraid that, if they 
should come hese, Colonel Bouquet will be on their towns 
and castles. For he has sent to them to come and make 
peace, and, on the contrary, if they should go to him we 
should be on them. They intend to be still until Bouquet 
first comes to them, and then send out and make peace, 
if possible ; if not, to fight him as long as they have a man 
left. But, believe me, they wait to get some advantage 
of us before they try for peace, Capt. Peters says Bou- 
quet is within thirty miles of their towns, and believes he 
is to make peace with them ; for Colonel Bradstreet had 
orders from General Gage, eight days ago, to make 
no peace with them, but to march and meet Bou- 
quet. But, on calling a council of war, and examining the 
Indians and Frenchmen, who were acquainted with the 
road, it was found to be thirty leagues to travel by land, 
and nothing to carry any provisions but on men's back, 
which, allowing for hindrances, must take forty Jays to 
go and come. There are four large rivers to pass, two of 
which must be crossed with rafts, and that very difficult. 
Considering the season of the year it was judged im 
practicable. And here we are, and for what I know not, 
nor when we are to leave it, 

" I am, &c. 

" ISRAEL PUTNAM." 

It gives us an exalted view of the conscious power and 
fearless courage of the brave chiefs, who, at this time,

commanded the Indian tribes on the frontier, to find them 
boldly meditating the utter annihilation of the British 
power in America, or to use the expressive language of 
Po;itiac, hoping " by one year's war, well pushed, to drive 
them into the sea." The colonies, at this time, numbered 
probably more than two millions of inhabitants, and were 
rapidly increasing. They had powerful armies, backed by 
others still more powerful, sent from Europe for their pro- 
tection. They had numerous well-appointed fortresses, 
with all the terrible engines of war, which civilized science 
had invented. They had numberless large towns and po- 
pulous cities, and their millions were all banded together, 
as one, for the common defence ; while the Indian tribes, 
divided among themselves, and inflamed against each other 
by the never-ceasing feuds of a hundred ages, knew no 
bond of union, and acknowledged no common head, who 
could harmonize their councils, or concentrate their power 
toward one point. They realized the prophetic charac- 
ter of the father of the wandering tribes of Arabia, " His 
hand shall be against every man, and every man's hand 
against him." 

Ten years had now elapsed, since Putnam, at the call of 
his country, relinquished the peaceful pursuits of rural 
life, for the stirring scenes and perilous duties of the camp. 
He entered the service without experience, but with a 
high reputation for personal bravery. He had risen regu- 
larly through every grade, from the command f a com- 
pany to that of a regiment. He had won the confidence of 
his superiors, and the affectionate regards of his men ; and 
now, the great object of the war being accomplished, and 
peace secured to the colonies on every side, he returned to 
the bosom of his family, and to the shades of private life, 
his brows crowned with enduring laurels, and his name, 



124 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

encircled with the halo of fame, associated with the best 
and bravest in the land. 

The part he had acted in " The Seven Years' War," 
was one of peculiar hardship and peril. Always in the 
van, when charging the enemy, and in the rear, when a 
retreat was ordered stationed among the outposts when 
the army was in camp scouring the woods or the lakes 
with a handful of men, or creeping stealthily alone into the 
enemy's lines his was ever the post of danger. But he 
encountered and achieved it all with a chivalrous indiffer- 
ence to personal danger, and an inexhaustible fruitful- 
ness of resources, which, while it excited the envy of a 
few, commanded the admiration of all. His military 
knowledge was all the fruit of his own experience and 
observation, the result of that strong common sense, that 
ready ingenuity in adapting himself to the circumstances 
in which he was placed, and that perfect coolness and self- 
possession in seasons of danger, for which he was emi- 
nently distinguished, and which qualified him, without 
the previous advantages of education, for the important 
stations he was called upon to fill. 

" Personal bravery," says Mr. Peabody, " is perhaps 
the cheapest of the military virtues ; but there was some- 
thing cool, daring and unostentatious in that of Putnam, 
which attracted equally the wonder of the cultivated and 
the rude. In the words, recorded by a personal friend* 
upon his monument, he had always l dared to lead where 
any dared to follow.' His disposition was full of the 
frankness of the soldier, united with a kindness and gene- 
rosity, not always found in union with the sterner quali- 
ties, demanded by the life of camps ; an extended inter- 
course with others had refined the asperity of his manners, 

* Dr. Dwight 



DOMESTIC AFFLICTION. 125 

without impairing the simplicity of his genuine New Eng- 
land character." 

In laying aside his uniform, and returning to his plough, 
and to the pleasures of domestic life, he lost nothing of 
that respect and esteem, with which the brave soldier and 
the accomplished officer had been regarded. Success had 
not inflated him with pride, or made him forgetful of his old 
connections. He possessed the entire good will and confi- 
dence of his neighbors and fellow-citizens, and stood very 
high in the public estimation, throughout the country, for 
integrity, courage and pairiotism. IS'o sooner was the 
sword laid away in its scabbard, then he was called, by the 
united voice of his fellow-citizens^ to counsel and aid them 
in the management of their civil affairs. And, during the 
entire interval of repose, between the French war and that 
of the Revolution, he was employed, by their choice, to fill 
the higher municipal offices, and to represent the town in 
the General Assembly of the colony. 

But who ever enjoyed sunshine in this life, which 
clouds did not darken ; Or found repose, which affliction 
did not mar ? Returning in peace to the bosom of his 
family, after so long a period of toil and danger, from so 
many vicissitudes of fortune, by land and sea, from weary 
marches and perilous adventures, from conflicts, single- 
handed, with a lurking foe, and the terrible melee of the 
battle-field, and " the imminent deadly breach," the 
veteran soldier might have promised himself, at least a 
brief interval of pure enjoyment, amid the loving and loved 
ones that clustered about his fireside, and graced and 
cheered his table. But he had scarcely returned to his 
home, when it was visited by the severest of earthly be- 
reavements. The wife of his youth, the mother of his 
children, was smitten by the shaft of death. After ten 
years of exposure to danger in almost every form, he came 



126 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

back, in full health and vigor, and with a heart yearning 
for the bliss which can only be found at home, to witness 
the dying struggle, and receive the dying blessing, of her 
who had been his counsellor and his comforter, and the 
chief joy of his existence, for a quarter of a century. It 
was a heavy stroke, and deeply and bitterly was it felt, 
though he murmured not against Him who dealt the 
blow. 

After a considerable period of widowhood, Colonel Put- 
nam married again. His second wife was Mrs. Deborah 
Gardner, the widow of John Gardner, Esq., the fifth pro- 
prietor of Gardner's Island. She was a native of Pomfret, 
the daughter of Mr. Avery, one of Putnam's neighbors. 
She accompanied him in most of the campaigns of the 
Revolutionary War, and died at his Head Quarters, in the 
Highlands, in 1777. Her youngest son, Septimus Gard- 
ner, entered the army, under his step-father, and died at 
Peekskill, about the same time with his mother. Mr. 
Putnam had no children by his second marriage.

THE causes which led to the Revolutionary War, and the 
establishment of American Independence, are too gene- 
rally understood to require detailed explanation here. 
The oppressive enactments of the mother-country, on the 
one hand, and the bold and spirited resistance of the colo- 
nies on the other, had already awakened feelings of no 
amiable character on both sides of the water. And, while 
the heroes and patriots of the provincial army were fight- 
ing bravely, side by side with the officers and soldiers of 
the crown, and learning the art of war in their campaigns 
against their French neighbors, the contest had already 
begun which was to divide them into separate armies, and 
array them in deadly hostility to each other. 

The Navigation Acts of 1651 and 1660, and others of a 
still later date, placing severe restrictions upon American 
commerce, had been the subject of frequent rononstrflnce, 



128 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

and had often been either quietly evaded or openly violat- 
ed. The " writs of assistance," or general warrants, 
ordered in 1761, for the discovery of contraband articles, 
which had been imported into the country without the 
payment of the established duties, were met by the bold 
and spirited denunciations of Thatcher, Otis, and the 
Adamses, nobly seconded by the voice of the people, so 
far as it could be heard through the press. The actual 
enforcement of the. laws, by the confiscation of smuggled 
goods, in 1763, increased the excitement, and alarmed the 
staunch lovers of liberty in the colonies. 

The first formal declaration of a settled purpose on the 
part of the ministers to tax the colonies directly was made 
by Mr. Grenville, prime minister of George III., in 1764. 
It was not only received with a burst of indignation in 
America, but met by an able and talented opposition in the 
British Parliament. The consequences were foreseen by 
those who best understood the American character, and 
valued the privileges of the British Constitution. But the 
ministers, backed by the obstinacy of the king, were not 
to be diverted from their purpose. The Stamp Act was 
passed in March, 1765, by a large majority of both 
houses of Parliament. 

When the news of the passage of this Act reached 
America, a general indignation spread throughout the 
country, breaking forth, in some places, in acts of outrage 
and violence, and in others assum'ng the spirit of calm but 
determined resistance. At Boston and Philadelphia the 
be.lls were muffled, and rung a funeral knell. At New 
York the Act was carried through the streets, with a 
death's head affixed to it, and styled " The Folly of Eng- 
land and the Ruin of America." When the stamped 
papers arrived in the country they were, in many places, 
seized and destroyed ; the houses of those who sided with 



MR. JNGERSOL, THE STAMP-OFFICER. 129 

the government were violently entered and plundered ; the 
stamp officers were compelled to resign their commissions ; 
and the doctrine was openly asserted, on every side, that 
England had no right whatever to tax America, or to 
claim a dollar of her money without her own free con- 
sent. 

Among those who entered most zealously into these 
measures of remonstrance and open resistance, was Colonel 
Putnam. With his accustomed fearlessness and impetu- 
osity, he set his face against every movement toward put- 
ting this hateful system of oppression into execution. By 
a concert of action throughout the colonies, the people had 
determined, in order to prevent the stamped paper from, 
being distributed, that the stamp-masters should not enter 
upon the execution of their offices. That appointmentjju 
Connecticut, had been conferred upon a Mr. Ingersol, t>f 
New Haven, a very dignified, sensible, and learned native 
of the colony ; who, upon being solicited to resign the 
trust, did not, in the first instance, give a satisfactory 
answer. He, probably, did not like the bold and peremp- 
tory style in which the application was made to him ; 
preferring rather to show his patriotism by his own free 
act, than by the dictation or compulsion of his fellow- 
citizens. 

The people, however, were resolute, and would not 
allow a moment's hesitation or delay. At the instigation 
of Colonel Putnam who was prevented from joining the 
party in person by an accident which had recently befallen 
him a large number of the substantial yeomanry of the 
province assembled at a convenient rendezvous in one of 
.the eastern counties, and proceeded in a body towards 
New Haven, to demand and receive the resignation of Mr. 
Jngi-rsol. Another similar body of self-constituted rulers 
was to have formed a junction with them in Branford. On 
I

the arrival of the eastern company at Hartford, they were 
informed that Mr. Ingersol was on his way to that place, 
where he was expected to arrive the next day, to claim 
the protection of the assembly. They, accordingly, took 
up their quarters there for the night having first posted 
their patrols on the southern and western avenues, to 
prevent the possibility of his arrival without their know- 
ledge. The next morning they resumed their line of 
march, and met Mr. Ingersol in Weathersfield. They 
immediately made known to him the errand on which they 
had come, giving him to understand that the people were 
resolute in their purpose, and not to be trifled with. After 
a little dignified hesitation, the worthy man yielded to the 
law of necessity, and., mounting on a round table, in the 
midst of his judges, read aloud the following paper : 

" Weathersfield, Sept. 9th, 1765. 

" I do hereby promise, that I never will receive any 
stamped papers which may arrive from Europe, in conse- 
quence of an Act lately passed in the Parliament of Great 
Britain ; nor officiate as stamp master or Distributor of 
Stamps, within the colony of Connecticut, either directly 
or indirectly. And I do hereby notify to all the Inhabit- 
ants of his Majesty's colony of Connecticut (notwithstand- 
ing the said office or trust has been committed to me) not 
to apply to me, ever after, for any stamped paper ; hereby 
declaring that I do resign the said office, and execute these 
Presents of my own FREE WILL AND ACCORD, without any 
equivocation or mental reservation. 

" In witness whereof, 1 have hereunto set my hand. 

" J. INGERSOL." 

Having finished the reading, he was desired to shout 
three times, " Liberty and property," which was respond- 
ed to by three loud and hearty huzzas from the assembled 



INTERVIEW WITH GOV. FITCH. i31 

multitude. He was then invited to dine with some o{ the 
principal men of the party and the place, by whom he was 
treated with the greatest respect and politeness. After 
this, he was escorted by about five hundred horse to Hart- 
ford, where he again read his resignation, amid the un- 
bounded acclamations of the people. All this was done 
in that quiet and orderly manner, which distinguished the 
lawful assemblages of the people, for purposes of counsel 
and the common defence, from the turbulent and ill-con- 
sidered outbreaks of an excited, irresponsible mob. The 
utmost urbanity and good humor prevailed, and jokes were 
freely exchanged, and kindly received, by both parties. 
During the progress of the cavalcade to Hartford, Mr. 
Ingersol, who rode a white horse, was asked what he 
thought, to find himself attended by such a numerous and 
motley retinue. He immediately replied, with a smile, 
" that he had now a clearer idea, than he had ever before 
conceived, of that passage in the Revelations, which de- 
scribes Death on the pale horse, and hell following A/'?n." 

Soon after this, Putnam, having so far recovered as to be 
able to attend to his ordinary duties, was deputed, with 
two other gentlemen, to wait on the Governor of the colo- 
ny, in relation to the same subject, and with the same 
resolute purpose of preventing the introduction of the hated 
papers into any part of the colony. The conversation that 
took place between Governor Fitch and Colonel Putnam 
on this occasion, will serve well to illustrate the spirit of 
the times, and the resolute character of the men, on whom 
the duty devolved of representing and leading the people. 
The object of the conference having been explained, and 
the Governor satisfied that the people were immovable in 
their determination to resist the slightest encroachment 
upon their rights, he asked, in some concern, addressing 
himself to Colonel Putnam 



132 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

" What shall I do, if the stamped paper should oe sent 
to me by the King's authority ?" 

" Lock it up," replied Putnam, " until we shall visit 
you again." 

" And what will you do then ?" 

" We shall expect you to give us the key of the room, 
in which it is deposited ; and, if you think proper, in 
order to screen yourself from blame, you may forewarn 
us, upon our peril, not to enter that room." 

" And what will you do afterwards ?" 

" Send it safely back again." 

" But if I should refuse you admission ?" 

" In such a case your house will be levelled with the 
dust in five minutes." 

Such interviews and scenes as this, could not fail to pro- 
duce a deep impression of the difficulty of enforcing the 
obnoxious law. In some of the colonies it was never at- 
tempted. The stamped paper was never sent into Con- 
necticut ; and it was supposed, at the time, that a report 
of Putnam's plain talk with the Governor, and the con- 
strained resignation of the stamp-officer at Hartford, de- 
terred them from trying the experiment in that quarter. 

The same spirit prevailed op every side. The Provin- 
cial assemblies were unanimous in their reprobation of the 
measure, and one long, loud note, not of remonstrance 
only, but of defiance, was heard from the masses of the 
people from north to south. Its echoes reached the ears 
or the infatuated legislators on the other side of the Atlan- 
tic and convinced them of the futility of attempting to rivet 
paper chains upon a people born to freedom, and jealous 
of thf slightest encroachment upon their rights. The 
Revenue System was accordingly abandoned for a season. 
The Stamp Act was repealed on the 18th of March, 1766. 
The news was received in America with lively expressions 



INN-KEEPING THE OLD SIGN. 133 

of joy and gratitude. Public thanksgivings were held. 
Trade with England, which had been suspended, was re- 
newed, and the importation of British goods encouraged, 
and a general calm, without a parallel in history, imme- 
diately succeeded the storm, which had raged with such 
threatening violence. 

During this short season of tranquillity, Putnam resumed 
)iis agricultural employments, which he pursued with his 
accustomed vigor, though slightly interrupted by two acci- 
dents, one of which deprived him of the first joint of the 
thumb of his right hand, while the other was attended 
with a compound fracture of his right thigh, which short- 
ened that leg nearly an inch, and made him slightly lame 
during the remainder of his life. He also, at this time, 
threw open his house for the accommodation of the pub- 
lic. The old sign, which swung before his door, as a 
token of rest and good cheer for the weary wayfarer, is 
now to be seen in the Museum of the Historical Society 
of Connecticut, at Hartford. It represents General Wolfe, 
in full uniform, his eye fixed, in an expression of fiery ear- 
nestness, upon some distant object, and his right arm ex- 
tended, in emphatic gesture, as if charging on the foe, or 
directing some other important movement of his army. 
The sign seems to have fared hardly in one respect, being 
plentifully sprinkled with shot-holes, which gives the young 
hero the appearance of having been deeply pitted with the 
small-pox. 

The Provincial officers and soldiers, who survived -the 
expedition to Havana, having deputed General Lyman to 
receive their portion of prize-money, he repaired to Eng- 
land for that purpose. He was charged, at the same 
time, with a commission from a company in America, 
called " Military Adventurers," to solicit from the crowu 
a grant of land on the Mississippi. 



134 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

The delays, vexations and disappointments, atten, ig 
this business, so chafed the spirit, and wounded the 
manly pride of General Lyman, that he sunk into a state 
of despondency and mental imbecility, and retiring to a 
solitary place, resolved never more to expose himself to 
the indignities and disappointments of public life, and de- 
termined never more to return to his native land, .lest he 
should be reproached with the failure of his mission. In 
this state of morbid depression, he was visited by some of 
his own family, who crossed the Atlantic in quest of him, 
and succeeded in finding his place of retreat. By their 
kindness, sympathy, and good nursing, he was soon restor- 
ed to his wonted health and activity, and once more re- 
paired to London, to prosecute the object of his mission. 

After several years, thus consumed in attendance upon 
court, the grant was obtained, and General Lyman re- 
turned home, comparatively successful. Colonel Putnam, 
with several other gentlemen, accompanied his old com- 
mander, in 1774, in a tour to the far west, to explore the 
tract, and make preparation for settling it. Such an ex- 
pedition was not accomplished with as much ease, seventy- 
five years ago, as at the present day. The steamboat was 
not known. The railroad had not been dreamed of. A 
trip to Oregon is not more difficult now, than was the pio- 
neer jaunt to the Mississippi, then. After a tedious voyage 
to the Balize, and a laborious passage up the river, and 
weeks of toilsome engineering, they succeeded in estab- 
lishing the metes and bounds of their grant, and locating 
the portions of the several grantees. This done, they all 
returned to Connecticut, with the intention of encourag- 
ing emigration, and planting a colony of industrious thriv- 
ing Yankees on the banks of the Great River. General 
Lyman returned thither in the course of the following 
season, and formed an establishment at Natchez, where 



NOTES OF PREPARATION. 135 

he remained till his death. Colonel Putnam placed some 
laborers, with provisions and farming utensils, on his sec- 
tion of the grant ; and, from his well-known enterprise 
and energy of character, would no doubt have pushed 
the speculation to a successful issue, had not the clouds, 
which began to gather anew over his devoted country, 
thrown a deep shade over all such prospects, and diverted 
his thoughts from enterprises of private gain, to devising 
and executing measures for the public weal. 

It was now manifest to every observer, that the affairs 
of the colonies had reached a crisis that, in the language 
of Washington, " the once happy and peaceful plains of 
America were either to be drenched in blood, or inhabited 
by slaves." The season for petition and remonstrance 
was gone by. The time for action had arrived. The 
future was big with events of immeasurable importance 
to the interests, not of the American colonies merely, but 
of humanity. The present was destined to be an epoch 
in the history of human progress. And the men, to whom 
Providence had assigned the task of directing the great 
struggle, by which it was to be achieved, were equipped 
for the service, and ready to take their posts. Under 
these men, as councillors and leaders, the people instinc- 
tively ranged themselves. The athletic frame, the bold 
and active mind, the prompt, determined air, and tried 
courage of Colonel Putnam, added to his large experience 
in military affairs, his ardent patriotism and untiring zeal, 
marked him out as one of the leaders, and gave him a con- 
spicuous rank among them. By his advice and assistance, 
measures were extensively taken, in his own province, to 
prepare for the worst that might come. New life was in- 
fused into the militia. The men. and even the boys, who 
were capable of bearing arms, were urged, and assisted, to 
devote themselves diligently to systematic exercise in the 



136 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

military art. Voluntary associations were formed among 
them, for regular practice in military manreuvres and drill- 
ing, and the execution of all the varied evolutions of the 
camp and the field. The militia trainings of that period 
bore no resemblance to the spiritless and purposeless farces 
of our day. They had an object, lofty, solemn, momen- 
tous, and were conducted with a spirit that made every 
soldier feel himself a man, and gave to every officer the 
aspect and bearing of a hero. Every village had its mili- 
tary school, and its miniature camp, where children learn- 
ed the art of Avar from their fathers, and where the scarred 
veteran acted over again the scenes of his youth, and taught 
the striplings to emulate them. Such were the notes of 
preparation that indicated the coming crisis.

THE repeal of the Stamp Act was accompanied by another 
declaratory Act, designed as a sort of salvo to the national 
pride of British Legislators, affirming that the Parliament 
had power to bind the colonies in all cases whatever 
a sufficient warning, it would seem, that the repeal was 
but a temporary truce, in the war against American rights. 
That truce was shorter than was at first anticipated. Tak- 
ing advantage of the absence of Mr. Pitt, who was confined 
by sickness in the country, Mr. Townshend, then chan- 
cellor of the Exchequer, introduced a bill into Parliament, 
in 1767, imposing duties on glass, paper, painters' colors, 
and tea, which was immediately passed, and approved by 
the king. A bill was also passed, establishing a board of 
trade in the colonies, independent of colonial legislation ; 
and others equally at variance with the known views of 
the Americans, as well as with the fundamental principles 
of the British constitution. 

On the revival of this scheme of oppression, the old 



138 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

spirit of resistance revived in all its force. The colonial 
Assemblies protested earnestly against it. The columns 
of the public papers were filled with spirited essays from 
the ablest political writers of the day, setting forth, in the 
clearest manner, the fallacy of the principles, and the 
injustice of these measures of the ministry ; and appealing 
earnestly to the people to resist them, even to the last 
extremity. Otis, the Adamses, Patrick Henry, and many 
others, stepped boldly forth to the defence of American 
liberty, and kindled a flame which was not to be quenched, 
but by the entire independence of the colonies from the 
domination of their unnatural step-mother. Some of 
them, by their fearless denunciation of British oppression, 
and their uncompromising advocacy of the doctrine of 
resistance and independence, rendered themselves so 
peculiarly obnoxious to the crown, as to be honored with 
a special exemption from the promise of pardon, which 
was subsequently offered to all who would return to their 
allegiance, and quietly submit to any burden which royalty, 
moved and instigated by a tyrannical ministry, might be 
pleased to lay upon them. 

Associations were immediately formed, and agreements 
entered into, to abstain entirely from the use of the articles 
enumerated in the bill, and to suspend, as far as possible, 
all commercial intercourse with the mother-country, till 
the policy of colonial taxation shoold be utterly and for 
ever abandoned. All foreign luxuries were dispensed 
with ; domestic manufactures of every kind were freely 
encouraged ; and other measures adopted, to show to 
their British taskmasters, that all the advantages and con- 
veniences of a lucrative commerce would be sacrificed in 
a moment, sooner than they would forego one jot or tittle 
of their birthright, as free born Englishmen. The. excite- 
ment grew warmer and warmer. Difficulties thickened 



DIFFICULT POSITION OF THE COLONIES. 139 

on every side. The colonial Assemblies were repeatedly 
threatened, dissolved, and broken up, only to meet again, 
with a sterner purpose of resistance, and bolder resolves 
than before. Soldiers were quartered upon the citizens, 
and stationed about the legislative halls, to overawe the 
people, and intimidate their advisers ; who only became 
the more bold and unyielding, at every new demonstration 
ot the power that was destined to enslave them. 

It was in the midst of these excitements, that Colonel 
Putnam made his exploring tour to the banks of the Mis 
sissippi. The season of his absence was one of pecu 
liar agitation and ferment, and he returned to find the 
storm of civil discord raging violently, and ready to burst 
over his devoted land. The first blood of the American 
Revolution had been spilt, in the massacre of the fifth of 
March, at Boston ; and other scenes of agitation had been 
enacted, which portended the coming conflict, and warned 
every patriot citizen to be ready at his post, to meet the 
impending crisis. It was clearly foreseen that it would 
not terminate but in blood. It was a time to try men's 
souls. America was thinly populated, divided into thir- 
teen separate governments, with many conflicting interests, 
and sectional jealousies, to distract her councils, and divide 
and weaken her strength ; without a head, without an 
army, without a treasury, and without credit. The odds 
against them were fearful, in case of actual outbreak, 
their antagonist being by far the most powerful nation on 
earth, both by sea and land, and capable of commanding 
the resources of nearly all Europe. She had also a tre- 
mendous advantage, in having the reins of government, in 
all the colonies, in her own hands ; and holding possession 
of the fortified posts, with a large part of the arms and 
ammunition of the country. Besides this, the people of 
America were as truly loyal as any in the wide spread 



140 ' LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM 

dominions of the king. They were proud of their ances- 
tors and their father-land. They prized highly the privi- 
leges of the British constitution ; and nothing short of a 
melancholy persuasion, that the principles involved in 
these measures of the ministry were subversive of every 
hope of liberty, guaranteed to them by that constitution, 
could have induced them to raise the standard of revolt. 

There were still many Americans, and among them 
some of the ablest and most intelligent men in the country, 
who held fast their allegiance to the king, and discoun- 
tenanced every act of resistance as arrant rebellion. Some, 
too, of the most experienced officers, who had served in 
the French War, and who well understood the military 
power of England, shrank from so unequal a contest, and 
frowned upon every measure which seemed calculated to 
widen the breach, and provoke an ultimate recourse to 
arms. In such circumstances, it required more than ordi- 
nary decision and courage to become a leader ; for though 
success would win for them enduring laurels, a failure 
would consign them all to the ignominious fate of rebels. 
Fortunately for us and the world, the crisis produced the 
men who were equal to its utmost exigency. Counsellors 
and statesmen, bold, sagacious, and far-seeing, resolved to 
hazard everything dear, sooner than relinquish one of the 
principles of liberty, for which alone they contended, 
were found in every province. Brave soldiers, and com- 
petent officers, men of ample military experience were 
not wanting, who were ready at a word, to leap into the 
breach, and lead their undisciplined fellow-citizens to bat- 
tle with the veteran troops and well-trained legions of the 
old world ; preferring the prospect of an early grave, or a 
prison and a halter, to the certainty of chains worse than 
those of iron, which can only enslave the body. 

Among the foremost and most conspicuous of the latter

class, vas Colonel Putnam, whose courage and patriotic 
zeal was well and widely known, and who possessed the 
entire confidence of the people, not only of Connecticut, 
but of the sister provinces. He entered at once, and heart- 
ily, into the preparatory measures, which signalized the 
trying interval between the first blood-shedding at Boston, 
and the actual opening of the grand drama at Lexington. 
By reference to the papers, and official documents of that 
period, we find him an active and zealous partizan in the 
affairs of the colonies, watching, as a sentinel at his post, 
the signs of the times, and urging, with all his accustomed 
impetuosity and energy, every expedient to rouse and keep 
alive the spirit of resistance, and evade or prevent the exe- 
cution of those hateful laws, which threatened to enslave 
them. Boston was, at that time, the head-quarters of 
what the Safglish were pleased to term " the rebellion," 
and the point upon which they concentrated their severest 
enactments, and their first military preparations to subdue 
the refractory colonies. Putnam was often there. He 
was familiarly known to General Gage, the British com- 
mander-in-chief, Lord Percy, Colonel Small, and many 
others, with whom he had formerly served, in the " Seven 
Years' War." His character, for all that constitutes a 
brave soldier and an able commander, was well known 
and highly appreciated among them ; while his personal 
qualities had endeared him greatly to those who had been 
most familiar with him, in war and in peace. 

As the crisis approached, and the storm of war seemed 
inevitable, the conversation often turned, from a warm dis- 
cussion of general principles, to matters of more personal 
concern. But Putnam was not a man to hesitate about 
consequences, when his mind was settled, and his resolu- 
tion fixed upon principles. When, therefore, he was 
questioned, by his British friends, as to the part he should 



142 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

take, in case the dispute should proceed to actual hostili 
ties, he always replied, and with an energy that left no 
doubt of the sincerity and heartiness of his determination 
" I shall take part with my country in any event ; and, 
whatever may happen, I am prepared to abide the conse-s. 
quences." 

When asked whether he, who had witnessed the prow- 
ess of the British arms, and their repeated victories by sea 
and land, did not believe them equal to the immediate con- 
quest of a people, who did not own a single ship, and who 
had neither armies, nor commanders, nor munitions of war 
he replied, with equal confidence, " I can only say, jus- 
tice would be on our side, and the event with Providence. 
And, if the combined forces of Great Britain and her colo- 
nies, required six full years to drive the French out of Ca- 
nada, I apprehetid it will be no easy task, for British 
troops alone, to enslave a country, much more extensive 
and populous than Canada. Besides, men fighting on their 
own soil, in defence of their altars, their hearths and their 
liberties, have an advantage, in the sacredness of their 
cause, over the mere mercenaries, who fight only for pay, 
with nothing at stake on the issue, but the idle breath of 
fame. For my part, I fully believe you will find it no 
easy matter to conquer these American provinces, poor as 
they are." 

On one occasion, he was asked, with an expressive 
sneer, if a well-appointed army of five thousand British 
veterans might not march, without serious molestation, 
from one end of the continent to the other. " No doubt 
they could," he replied, with animation, " if they behaved 
themselves civilly, and paid well for everything they 
wanted. But," he added, after a moment's pause, " if 
they should attempt it in a hostile manner, the American 
women, if the men were out of the way, would meet them 



AN ALARM. 143 

with their ladles and broomsticks, and put them to rout, 
before they had measured half the oreadth of the land." 

Such was the substance of frequent amicable discussions, 
which took place between the advocates of the crown on 
the one part, and the bold American leaders on the other, 
indicating clearly the nature of the contest, in which they 
were soon to engage, but never resulting in conviction in 
the minds of the disputants. 

Among the measures of preparation and precaution, 
which were generally adopted, and ably sustained, in all 
the colonies, was the appointment of committees of vigi- 
lance and correspondence, whose duty it was, to keep the 
whole people informed of whatever occurred in any part 
of the land, that should alarm the fears, or awaken the jea- 
lousy of the most sensitive defenders of liberty. Colonel 
Putnam was chairman of such a committee, for the district 
in which he resided, and,s such, incurred a large share 
of the displeasure of the British party, for his sleepless 
vigilance, and prompt, untiring zeal. 

A gentleman, in New York, writing to a friend in Anna- 
polis, under date of September 6th, 1774, says : " Two 
days ago, we were alarmed by the arrival of an express 
from Colonel Putnam, of Connecticut, to the committee of 
this city, with the intelligence that a certain person was 
just come to his house from Boston, to acquaint him that 
on affray had happened between the people and the troops 
in Boston. Colonel Putnam, upon this advice, alarmed 
the whole country, moving them to arm themselves, and 
take the road to Boston which they actually did, inso- 
much that, the postman says, that the roads were covered 
with people." 

This proved to be a false alarm, and the part which 
Colonel Putnam took in it, was the subject of no little 
comment in those papers of the time, that were still in the 



144 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

British interest. One of General Gage's defenders, in a 
letter to Peyton Randolph, of Virginia, written at this 
juncture, says : " Colonel Putnam, of Connecticut, with a. 
zeal, not according to knowledge, alarmed that and all the 
southern provinces, and the whole country was in mo- 
tion." 

To show the spirit of the man, and the excited state of 
the country at this time, we give the following extract 
from Colonel Putnam's letter, explaining and justifying 
the part he took in the affair. After stating how the story 
came to him, by a Captain Keys, purporting to be an au- 
thorised messenger from Boston, he adds : " Now I submit 
it to the determination of every candid and unprejudiced 
reader, whether my conduct, in writing the above-mention- 
ed letter, merits the imputation of imprudence, as asserted 
by said writer, or whether they would have me tamely sit 
down, a spectator of the inhuman sacrifice of my friends 
and fellow-countrymen. * * * And pray, what easier 
way could I have proceeded, than in writing to one of the 
militia captains, whom I desired to forward the intelligence 
to the adjacent towns, when I really believed the story to 
be true ? Which having done, I mounted my horse, and 
made the best of my way towards Boston, having only 
four gentlemen to accompany me. Having proceeded as 
far as Douglass, which is about thirty miles from my 
house, I met Captain Hill, of that town, with his company, 
who had been down within about thirty miles from Boston, 
and had just returned. He informed me that the alarm 
was false, and that the forces of Worcester and Sutton 
were on their return. I then turned my course home- 
wards, without loss of time, and reached my house about 
sun-rising on Sunday morning, taking care to acquaint the 
people on the road, that they need not proceed any fur- 
ther. 



CAUSE OF THE ALARM. 145 

" I believe the alarm was first occasioned by Mr. Ben- 
jamin Hallowell, who, going into Boston in a great fright, 
informed the army that he had killed one man, and wound- 
ed another, while they were pursuing him from Cam-' 
bridge, aud the country were all in arms, marching towards 
Boston, which threw the military into great consternation. 
* * In the midst of this hurry and confusion, a post 
was dispatched into the country, but by whom, or to an- 
swer what purpose, I cannot tell. But what took place in 
consequence of it, is evident. General Gage's apprehen- 
sions of danger were so great, that he speedily began to 
fortify the entrance to the town, to prevent a surprise from 
the enemy without."* 

The agitation, here referred to,, was that which resulted 
from General Gage's taking possession of the powder in 
the Arsenal, at Charlestown. The Arsenal was situated 
in the north-west part of the town, between Medford and 
Cambridge. About two hundred of the British troops, in 
thirteen boats, passed silently up the Mystic River, during 
the night of the 1st of September; and, disembarking at a 
convenient place, proceeded to the powder-house, and 
carried off the entire quantity of powder deposited there, 
amounting to nearly three hundred barrels. Intelligence 
of this transaction was rapidly circulated ; and, in the 
morning, several thousand inhabitants of the neighboring 
towns assembled at Cambridge, principally in arms, and 
were with difficulty restrained from marching into Boston, 
to demand a delivery of the powder, and, in case of refu- 
sal, to attack the troops. Amidst the noise and confusion 
attending this affair, there sprang up a rumor, that the 
fleet and troops were firing on the town of Boston. It 
flew through New England with such rapidity, that, in 
less than twenty-four hours, there were between thirty and 

* Am. Arch., 4th Series. Vol. i., p. 942. 
J 



146 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

forty thousand men in arms. The roads to Boston were 
thronged in all directions. And there can be no doubt, 
that, if the report which caused all this excitement had 
proved true, General Gage would, at that time, have been 
attacked in his citadel, and his whole military force anni- 
hilated at a blow. At that date, his force was compara- 
tively small, and the fortifications, which he afterwards 
relied on to protect him from incursions from the country, 
were not yet erected. It was the serious aspect of this 
occasion, and the determined air of the people who 
gathered by thousands from all sides, at the first tap of the 
drum that suggested the necessity of such defences.

IT was in this state of general excitement, and individual 
alarm and watchfulness, that the war of the Revolution 
broke upon the colonies. They were, in a great measure, 
unprepared for any serious conflict, but were unanimously 
resolved to submit to extermination at the point of the 
bayonet, rather than yield to oppression under the forms of 
law. They had no army, though almost every man and boy 
in the land was ready to step into the ranks, at a moment's 
warning. Their legislative assemblies were forcibly dis- 
solved ; the inhabitants were formally declared rebels ; 
and an army sent to Boston to subdue them. 

On the dissolution of the Assembly of Massachusetts, 
its members met a;ain, and resolved themselves into a 

O / 

Provincial Congress. They appointed committees of 
*' safety," and " supplies," and voted to raise and organize 



148 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

an army of twelve thousand men. They also made 
arrangements for the immediate enlistment of one fourth 
part of the militia, as minute-men, to be ready for action 
at a moment's warning. Similar preparations, proportion- 
ed in extent to the population of each, were made in the 
other colonies. Military stores and ammunition were 
purchased, and magazines provided, in suitable places, 
for their reception. Meanwhile, the Americans carefully 
abstained from all offensive acts. The first aggression 
was on the part of General Gage. Having previously 
seized, and conveyed to Boston, the ammunition and mili- 
tary stores in the provincial arsenals at Cambridge and 
Charlestown, he proceeded, on the night of the 18th of 
April, 1775, to dispatch a force of eight hundred men, 
under the command of Colonel Smith and Major Pitcairn, 
to destroy those at Concord. 

This expedition was planned in profound secrecy ; and 
the greatest precautions were taken to prevent the intelli- 
gence of it from going out in advance, to alarm the peo- 
ple. But the Yankees were too wakeful to be taken by 
surprise. The patriots of Boston, by some means, became 
acquainted with the Governor's design, and Dr. Warren 
immediately dispatched confidential messengers along the 
supposed route, to prepare for their reception. At Lex- 
ington, a little more than half way to Concord, where 
they arrived about daylight, on the morning of the 19th, 
the British troops met with the first appearance of hostile 
resistance. About seventy men, under command of Cap- 
tain Parker, were drawn up on the green. Major Pit- 
cairn, supposing the voice of a British officer, backed by 
such a force as he had at his feet, would be quite sufficient 
to subdue a single company of raw militia, rode up to their 
line, and cried out, in an insolent tone, " Disperse, you 
rebels, throw down your arms and disperse." Not being

obeyed, he discharged his pistol, and ordered his soldiers 
to fire. Several of the militia were killed, and the rest, 
feeling it was useless to contend with numbers so greatly 
superior, retreated and dispersed, but only to gather again, 
with large reinforcements from every quarter. 

The detachment proceeded, without further interrup- 
tion, to Concord, destroyed a part of the stores deposited 
there, and made a hasty retreat. But the militia of all the 
surrounding country, having been alarmed, assembled in 
great numbers. A smart skirmish ensued, and several 
were killed on both sides. To retreat through such a 
country, where every man was an enemy, if not a disci- 
plined soldier, and where every house, and tree, and fence, 
sheltered one or more expert marksmen, each capable of 
picking off his man at any reasonable distance, was no easy 
matter. The Americans hung upon their rear, and harassed 
them on every side, and would inevitably have cut the 
whole detachment in pieces, had not Lord Percy, with a 
reinforcement of nine hundred men and two field pieces, 
met them at Lexington. 

Lord Percy formed his detachment into a square, in 
which he enclosed Colonel Smith's party, who, according 
to Stedman, " were so much exhausted with fatigue, that 
they were obliged to lie down for rest on the ground, their 
tongues hanging out of their mouths, like those of dogs 
after a chase." 

The enemy, now amounting to about seventeen hundred 
men, having halted an hour or two at Lexington, recom- 
menced their march, but the attack from the Provincials 
was renewed at the same time, and an irregular, yet very 
galling fire was kept up on each flank, as well as in front 
and rear. The close firing from behind stone walls, by good 
marksmen, put them in no small confusion ; but they, on 
their part, kep< up a brisk retreating fire on the militia and 



150 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

minute-men. A little after sunset, they reached Bunker's 
Hill, where, exhausted with excessive fatigue, they re- 
mained during the night, protected from further annoyance 
by the guns of the Somerset man-of-war, which was so 
situated as to rake the neck, and so prevent their pursuers 
from gaining access to Charlestown. The following day, 
they crossed over to Boston, carrying with them ample 
evidence to satisfy General Gage, that the work of enslav- 
ing the colonies would be no farce. 

The British lost, during this expedition, in killed, 
wounded, and missing, nearly three hundred men ; the 
loss of the Provincials being less than one third that num- 
ber. 

During the retreat from Lexington, Major Pitcairn's 
horse was shot under him. The Major fell with him, and 
only escaped being made a prisoner, by feigning himself 
dead. His pursuers, coming up, pulled his pistols from 
his holsters, and leaving him unmolested, kept on their 
march. When they had passed out of sight, he took to 
nis feet, and, by a singular good fortune, succeeded in 
escaping their vigilance, and overtaking his friends. His 
pistols were presented to General Putnam, on his arrival 
at Cambridge, and were his constant companions through 
all his subsequent military career. They are still in the 
possession of one of his grandsons, John P. Putnam, Esq., 
of Western New York. They are represented as being 
of exquisite workmanship.* 

* There was another relic of the old hero, the remains of which 
may, perhaps, at some future day, become the property of one of the 
bol 1 watermen on the Ohio. We refer to the good old musket that 
killed the wolf, and accompanied its owner through all the perils of 
the Seven Years' War. It is said to have been dropped overboard, in 
the Ohio, as the General, in one of his western expeditions, was 
crossing that river in a boat. 



THE COUNTRY IN ARMS. 151 

With the rapidity of lightning, the intelligence spread on 
every side, that American blood had been shed by the 
British troops at Lexington. It was the signal and decla- 
ration of war. The country was all in motion. The mili- 
tia, on all sides, seized their arms, which had been kept 
in constant readiness, and rushed to the scene of action. 
In the course of a few days, a line of encampment was 
formed from Dorchester, through Roxbury, Brookline, 
Cambridge and Charlestown, to. the Mystic River, thus 
completely environing the British troops in Boston, with 
an army of twenty thousand men. 

The alarm, which was carried by a man with a drum 
on horseback, found Putnam ploughing in the field. Cap- 
tain Hubbard, afterwards a quarter-master in the army, 
was in the adjoining field. They were both ready for ac- 
tion in their own way. Hubbard was a cool, systematic, 
orderly man. He walked quietly home, put things in 
order, filled his knapsack, and took his way to the camp. 
Putnam merely unyoked his team from his plough, and 
bidding his boy to go home, and tell his mother where he 
was gone, mounted his horse, and dashed away down the 
road towards Boston. In twenty-four hours he was there, 
a distance, in those days, of nearly one hundred miles. He 
attended a council of war at Cambridge, on the 21st, 
where the parole, in honor of his arrival, was " Putnam."* 

Finding the British confined to Boston, and invested 
with a sufficient force to watch their movements, and being 
especially requested by the Legislature of Connecticut, 
then in session, to meet them for the purpose of consulta- 
tion, he returned at once to Hartford. Having assisted in 
levying and organizing a regiment, under authority of the 
Legislature, by whom he was promoted to be BrJgadier- 
General, he hastened back to Cambridge, from which

place he was absent only one week, leaving orders for the 
troops to follow as speedily as possible. Among those 
troops, Knowlton, Durkee, and many others, who had 
served with him in the French and Indian Wars, were 
foremost to enlist under the banner of so able and tried a 
commander. 

Collected, as the American forces were, from different 
and independent provinces, they were without a common 
head, and liable to all the difficulties arising from personal 
jealousy and military pride, in arranging their respective 
stations and commands. Some of the best officers took 
offence at the position to which they were assigned ; 
and some absolutely refused obedience to those who were 
ranked above them. For the most part, however, the 
utmost harmony and good feeling prevailed. To remedy, 
on their part, the difficulties arising from this cause the 
Council of Connecticut passed a resolution, advising the 
Governor " to order the officers and soldiers of the pro- 
vince to be subordinate, and yield obedience to the General 
and commanding officer of Massachusetts Bay, while act- 
ing in that province, and until the Governor should see fit 
to order otherwise."* Whatever may have been the case 
with other officers, it appears that General Putnam's estab- 
lished reputation, and universal popularity, secured for 
him the confidence of all, and raised him at once to the 
post of honor and of danger. The supreme command, by 
the above resolution, was vested in Major-General Ward. 
Putnam, as appears, among other evidences, from the 
following extracts from letters of the time, held a separate 
command under him, at an advanced post, which it was 
deemed of great importance to defend ; and was regarded, 
at the time, as but little inferior to the commander-in- 
chief. The first is from Jedediah Huntington to Jonathan 
* Am. Archives, 4th Series, vol. ii., page 1039. 



HIS POSITION IN THE ARMY. 153 

Trumbull, jr., Governor of Connecticut, dated Cambridge, 
April 27th, 1775, and says : " General Ward is at Rox- 
bury. General Putnam is commander-in-chief at this 
place. They have both of them too much business upon 
their hands." 

The second is from an intercepted letter of one of the 
British soldiers in Boston, to his friends in England, dated 
April 30, 1775 : " The whole country is in arms against 
us, and they are headed by two of the Generals that 
headed our army in the last war. Their names are Ward 
and Putnam." * They were both distinguished in the 
French War, and bore an active part, the former as a 
Lieutenant-Colonel, the latter as a Major, in the disastrous 
storming of Ticonderoga, under the command of General 
Abercrombie ; and now, by a singular concurrence of 
events, were associated in the direction of an army, in 
open hostility to their old commanders, and comrades in 
arms. Ward, as Major-General, and commander-in-chief 
of the Massachusetts troops, was first. His head-quarters 
were at Cambridge, and Putnam was his principal execu- 
tive officer in that wing of the army ; his immediate com- 
mand being a central and advanced position, on the north- 
ern bank of Charles River, in Cambridge, and the same 
spot where Smith and Pitcairn's detachment landed, on 
the night of the 17th of April, in their stealthy march 
to Lexington. Wooster and Spencer, who were his 
superiors in rank in his own province, were stationed at 
Roxbury, with the right wing of the army under the com- 
mand of Lieutenant-General Thomas. 

One of the measures resorted to by the British com- 
manders, to weaken the forces of their adversaries, was an 
attempt to win over to the king, by bribes of gold and 
offices of distinction, some of the ablest and bravest of our 

* Am. Archives, 4th Series, vol. ii., page 423. 

7* 



154 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

military leaders. With some, among whom were Rogers, 
William Stark, &c., they were successful. But Putnam, 
John Stark, Henry Lee, and many others, spurned the pro- 
posal with a contempt and dignity becoming their true- 
hearted patriotism, and the claims of their injured country. 
In the case of Putnam, the bait held out was a Major- 
General's commission in the British establishment, and a 
large pecuniary compensation for his services, as well as a 
handsome provision for his sons. 

" These facts," as Mr. Everett happily remarks, in his 
memoir of General Stark, " show that the course pursued 
by the gallant and patriotic officers, who had distinguished 
themselves in the Seven Years' War, and who hastened 
to range themselves on the side of the Revolution, was not 
a hasty and unreflecting adhesion to the popular cause. 
They prove that the question was presented to the mind 
of (Putnam) as one to be weighed deliberately, and that 
he decided for his country, against the influence of author- 
ity and temptation, to which many a mind would have 
yielded. His mind, however, was made up from the first." 
And he never wavered or hesitated in the choice he had 
made. 

The inhabitants of Boston, finding their commerce 
broken up, and themselves cut off from all communication 
with the country, began to be seriously distressed for pro- 
visions. General Gage, taking advantage of this distress, 
promised to allow them all to leave the town, if they 
would first deliver up their arms. The terms were rea- 
dily complied with. But the General, having received 
their arms, basely refused to let the people go. It would 
seem that he wished to hold them for his own security, to 
guard against an attack from their friends without. At 
least, such was the charitable construction put upon his 



INTRKNCHMENT S S K I K M I 8 H . 155 

breach of faith, by the poet Trumbull, in the first canto of 
McFingal : 

" So Gage, of late agreed, you know, 

To let the Boston people go ; 

Yet, when he saw, 'gainst troops that brav'd him, 

They were the only guards that saved him, 

Kept off that satan of a Putnam 

From breaking in to maul and mutt'n him, 

He'd too much wit such leagues to observe, 

And shut them in again to starve." 

The first object of the besieging Generals was to construct 
a line of intrenchments, which, if not a sufficient protec- 
tion against actual assault, would serve to inspire an undis- 
ciplined and inexperienced army with confidence in their 
position. In devising and completing these defences, the 
ingenuity, industry, and fine humor of General Putnam 
were of the greatest service. The lines went up with 
astonishing rapidity ; and, in less than a month, the ex- 
tended camp of the American army, stretching from Dor- 
chester to Chelsea, a circuit of not less than twelve miles, 
was so fortified in every assailable part, as to secure every 
practicable pass from Boston to the country. The remains 
of those simple, impromptu redoubts are still to be seen 
in many places along the line of the encampment. 

Having completed their intrenchments, 'the next care of 
the American commanders was to cut off, as far as possi- 
ble, such sources of supply as lay within the reach of the 
enemy. For this purpose, an expedition was set on foot 
to drive off the live stock from the islands in Boston Bay. 
Those nearest the encampment, and the most important, 
were Hog-Island, and Noddle-Island the latter being now 
known as East Boston. From Chelsea to the former of 
these, the water is scarcely two feet deep, at low tide. 
It, therefore, required neither bridges nor boats to effect 



156 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

the passage. The space between the two islands is also 
fordable at low water. 

On Saturday, the 27th of May, at eleven o'clock in the 
morning, a party, consisting of between twenty and thirty 
men, passed over to Hog-Island, and commenced driving 
off the stock that was there. They were interrupted in 
their operations, and drawn into a skirmish with a party 
of marines who were stationed there to protect the stock 
asssisted by another party in a schooner and sloop, that 
were instantly dispatched to their aid from the fleet in 
Boston harbor. They succeeded, however, in securing 
and killing a considerable number of horses and cows, as 
well as in bringing down several of the British marines, 
upon whom they kept up a steady and well-directed firing 
during their retreat. 

Having cleared Hog-Island, notwithstanding the oppo- 
sition of the marines, and effected their retreat to Chelsea, 
without the loss of a man, they drew up on the neck, and 
sent for a reinforcement, to complete the object of their 
expedition. This was immediately furnished. It con- 
sisted of three hundred men, with two field pieces (four 
pounders), under the command of General Putnam. War- 
ren, who had not then received his appointment in the 
army, accompanied him as a volunteer. Being obliged to 
wait the time of the tide, it was near nine o'clock in the 
evening before they reached the island. General Putnam 
then went down to the beach, and hailed the schooner, 
demanding an immediate surrender, and promising good 
quarters in case of a quiet submission. This demand 
was answered by two cannon shot from the schooner ; 
which was immediately returned by a discharge of the 
American field-pieces. From this time, a heavy fire was 
kept up on both sides, till near eleven o'clock, when the 
firing from the schooner ceased. Her decks had been

completely swept by the pieces and small arms of the 
Americans, and her crew was now obliged to abandon her 
and take to the boats a considerable number of which had 
been sent from the ships to their assistance, with a rein- 
forcement of marines. 

The schooner being thus deserted, drifted on shore* 
About break of day, the provincials, having first stripped 
her, carried some hay under her stern, and set her on fire 
the men in the sloop, meanwhile, keeping up a small 
fire upon them. About the same time, a heavy cannonad- 
ing was commenced at Noddle-Island (East Boston) Hill, 
by a fresh party of marines from the British fleet; notwith- 
standing which, Putnam plied the sloop so briskly, that 
she was soon entirely disabled. To prevent her from 
sharing the fate of the schooner, she was towed off by the 
boats, and thus the conflict ceased. The expedition was 
entirely successful, having been effected by the loss of one 
man only killed, and four slightly wounded one by the 
bursting of his own gun, and another losing only his little 
finger. The loss of the British was twenty killed, and 
fifty wounded, besides four double fortified four pounders, 
twelve swivels, and a quantity of rigging, sails, clothes and 
money, taken from the schooner.* It also brought away 
from the keeping and use of the British, several hundred 
sheep and cattle, and secured them for the benefit of the 
Americans. 

A number of prisoners having been taken on both sides, 
in the various skirmishes since the battle of Lexington, 
arrangements were made for an exchange to take place on 
the 6th of June. General Putnam and Dr. Warren were 
appointed to conduct the prisoners, on their part, to the 
place of meeting. Entering Charlestown about noon, 
under the escort of Captain Chester's company of Wea-

thersfield infantry the elite corps of the army and 
marching slowly through it, they halted at the ferry ; 
where, upon a signal being given, Majors Moncrief and 
Small landed from the Lively, to receive the prisoners, 
and to see their old friend, and comrade in arms, General 
Putnam. They had served together in the Seven Years' 
War ; had shared the dangers and hardships of the camp, 
in a common cause ; and had learned to regard each other 
with that peculiar respect and affection, which brave men 
and good soldiers always feel for their comrades, and 
which they are ever as ready to recognize in a foe, as in 
a friend. Their meeting was truly cordial and affection- 
ate.* Their present differences were forgotten for the 
moment, and, when the wounded privates had been sent 
on board the Lively, Major Small, Major Moncrief, and 
the captive officers, repaired with General Putnam and 
Dr. Warren to the house of Dr. Foster, where an enter- 
tainment was provided for them. 

About three o'clock, a signal was made from the Lively, 
that the exchange prisoners were ready to come on shore ; 
upon which General Putnam and Major Moncrief went 
down to the ferry to receive them. They then returned 
to their company at Dr. Foster's, and spent an hour or 
two in a very agreeable manner. Between five and six 
o'clock they parted ; Major Moncrief, with his released 
officers, 'going on board the Lively, and Putnam and 
Warren, with their new found friends, returning, under the 
same escort as before, to Cambridge. The whole affair 
was conducted with the utmost decency and good humor 

* The late Governor Brooks, of Massachusetts, who was present 
at this interview, stated, that when Putnam and his British friends 
met at Charlestown, they ran into each other's arms, and kissed each 
other, to the great diversion and astonishment of tRe country people 
of the army. 



KIND TREATMENT OF PRISONERS. 159 

neither party realizing at all, that in ten short days they 
would be arranged in bloody conflict, each using his 
utmost endeavor to maim, capture, or destroy, the other. 
To those who have not been trained to arms, it seems 
impossible that men who truly love, admire, and respect 
each other, should be capable of being excited, by the 
beat of a drum, the blast of a trumpet, or the voice of a 
commander, to such desperate and savage exertions for 
mutual destruction. But such is war. 

It is greatly to the credit of the American army, at this 
period, which they maintained throughout the whole war, 
that the British officers, on parting with their captors, 
expressed the most grateful acknowledgments for the kind 
and generous treatment they had received during the term, 
of their captivity. The privates, who were all woundea 
men, did the same in the strongest terms some of them 
with tears, expressing their grateful sense of the tender- 
ness which had been shown to them in their miserable 
situation. A writer of that day, in describing the scene, 
and contrasting the treatment of American prisoners among 
the British, with that of their prisoners in our camp, con- 
cludes with the following sensible remarks : " Compassion 
is as essential a part of the character of a truly brave man, 
as daring ; and an insult offered to a person entirely in the 
power of the insulter, savors as strongly of cowardice, as 
it does of cruelty." In this quality of compassion and 
generosity to his foes, General Putnam was not excelled 
by any officer in the army. He was sometimes reproach- 
ed, by those of a sterner character, for carrying this virtue 
too far, and showing too much lenity to the enemies of his 
country. He was incapable of a lasting resentment, and 
never regarded a foe unarmed as any longer a foe, or a 
prisoner as other than an unfortunate friend. 

The position of the contending parties was peculiar, 



160 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

The Americans greatly outnumbered the British, but were, 
at the same time, altogether inferior to them in arms, am- 
munition, and all the other means of active warfare. They 
had full knowledge of the force and equipments of the 
enemy, and of most of their plans and designs. The Bri- 
tish General, on the other hand, was ignorant of the real 
strength of his antagonist. He, therefore, quietly suffered 
himself to be shut up, for several weeks, in his narrow 
quarters in Boston ; looking down upon an enemy whom 
he affected to despise, but whom he did not dare to invite 
to a general engagement. That enemy, too sensible of his 
own weakness to provoke an engagement, yet daily acquir- 
ing the means and the power to meet it, when it should 
become inevitable, was calmly, hopefully awaiting the 
issue ; equally resolved to yield nothing to fear, and to 
hazard nothing by presumption.

THE American commanders, having ascertained that the 
British intended to take possession of the heights of 
Charlestown, as a vantage ground from which to dislodge 
them from some of their intrenchments, and thus make a 
way into the country, resolved, by a sudden and secret 
movement, to defeat the project, by advancing to that 
position a. portion of the left wing of their own camp. 

Putnam, who had already carefully examined the 
ground, was strenuously in favor of this movement, and 
had urged it again and again in council, with all the argu- 
ments at his command. In common with Prescott, and 



162 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

other veterans, who understood the character of the Ame 
rican soldiery, and knew the immense advantage to the 
order and discipline of the army, which would be derived 
from active and hazardous service, he had repeatedly pro- 
posed to lead a party which should invite an engagement 
with the enemy. Nothing short of this, it was held, would 
satisfy the army, or the country, who were growing weary 
of their fruitless inaction. It was with peculiar satisfac- 
tion, therefore, that they hailed the decision of the Coun- 
cil, to occupy the heights of Charlestown, and show a bold 
front to the enemy. 

The measure was ably opposed by some of the best and 
bravest men in the Council, and there were obstacles in 
the way of its accomplishment, which would have appalled 
any other men, than those who planned and achieved it. 
One of these was the want of powder. There were, at 
that time, only eleven barrels in the public depots, and 
sixty-seven barrels in all Massachusetts scarcely enough, 
under the most prudent management, for one day's fight- 
ing. To this objection, General Pomeroy answered that 
he was ready to lead his men to battle with but five car- 
tridges a-piece. They were all experienced marksmen, 
and would fire no random shots ; and if every American 
killed his five, they would have but little occasion for 
more powder. 

Ward and Warren objected, that the enterprise would 
bring on a general engagement, for which they were by no 
means prepared. To this Putnam replied, " We will risk 
only two thousand men. We will go on with these, and 
defend ourselves as long as possible ; and, if driven to re- 
treat, we are more active than the enemy, and every stone- 
wall shall be lined with their dead. And, at the worst, 
suppose us surrounded, and no retreat, we will set our 
country an example, of which it shall not be ashamed, and

teach mercenaries what men can do, who are determined 
to live or die free." 

Warren walked the floor, then paused, and leaned on 
his chair. " Almost thou persuadest me, General Put- 
lam," he said, " but I must still think the project rash ; if 
you execute it, however, you will not be surprised to find 
me at your side." 

" I hope not," replied Putnam, " you are young, and 
your country has much to hope from you, in council and in 
the field. Let us, who are old, and can be spared, begin 
the fray. There will be time enough for you hereafter, 
for it will not soon be over."* 

The bolder counsels prevailed, and orders were issued 
to Colonels Prescott and Bridge, and the regiment of 
Colonel Frye, to be prepared for an expedition with all 
their men, who were fit for service, and with one day's 
provision. The same order was issued to one hundred 
and twenty men of General Putnam's regiment, under the 
command of the brave Captain Knowlton, and one com- 
pany of artillery, with two field pieces. Putnam having 
the general superintendence of the expedition, and Colonel 
Gridley, the chief Engineer, accompanied the troops. 

Putnam's eldest son was a Captain under him. His 
youngest, only sixteen, was a volunteer. At sunset his 
father said to him, " You will go to Mrs. Inman's to-night 
as usual ; stay there to-morrow, and if they find it neces- 
sary to leave town, you must go with them." From this 
order, and the attending circumstances, the young man 
knew there was to be a military movement of some impor- 
tance, in which his father would participate. " My ima- 
gination," says he, " figured him as mangled with wounds, 
and no one near to aid him. I earnestly entreated permis-

Swett.

sion to accompany him. ' You, my dear father, may need 
assistance, much more than Mrs. Inman ; pray, let me go 
where you are going.' ' No, no, Daniel, do as I bid you,' 
was the reply, which he affected to give sternly, while his 
voice faltered, and his eyes filled, as if entering into my 
feelings. He added, ' You can do little, my son, where I 
am going, and there will be enough to take care of me." 

The peninsula of Charlestown is a mile and one-eighth 
in length, from east to west, and two-thirds of a mile across, 
from north to south. The Mystic River forms its north- 
ern, and the Charles River its southern border the dis- 
tance between them, at the Neck, being only one hundred 
and thirty yards. A narrow channel, separates it from 
Boston on the east. Bunker's Hill commences at the 
Neck, and rises abruptly to the height of one hundred and 
thirteen feet, and then, falling off in a gentle slope towards 
the east, stretches, in a low ridge, for a considerable dis- 
tance along the shore of the Mystic, and parallel with 
Breed's Hill. Breed's Hill, which is eighty-seven feet 
high, commences near the southern extremity of Bunkei 
Hill, and extends towards the south and east, the two 
summits being distant from each other one hundred and 
thirty rods. 

The ground on the east of Breed's Hi'l, as well as on 
the north, between that and the village before mentioned, 
is low and marshy, constituting what was called the 
slough. The village of Charlestown was on the south side 
of the hill, and had begun already to extend itself a little 
upon its slope. Morton's Point, where the ground was 
also somewhat elevated, the hill being thirty-five feet 
above the level of the water, forms the north-eastern ex- 
tremity of the peninsula, with a narrow channel between 
that and Noddle Island. It is now the site of the Charles- 
town Navy Yard, the hill having been levelled for the 



THE PLACE TO BE FORTIFIED. 165 

mutual accommodation of the town and the Navy Yard. 
The peninsula was traversed, on its northern side, by a 
narrow road, which, branching off at the Neck from the 
main avenue to the village, ran over Bunker's, and swept 
entirely around Breed's Hill, approaching very near the 
summit of the latter on its southern side. 

The detachment, drafted for this expedition, consisting 
of about one thousand men, under the immediate command 
of Colonel Prescott, were assembled on the common at 
Cambridge, at an early hour on the evening of the 16th 
of June, where prayers were offered by Rev. President 
Langdon, of Harvard College. Immediately after dark 
they commenced their silent march through Cambridge 
and across the Neck, Colonel Prescott leading the way. 
He was attended only by two sergeants, carrying dark lan- 
terns, open only in the rear. 

Arrived at the base of Bunker's Hill, they found the 
wagons laden with intrenching tools, and then only were 
the men made acquainted with the nature and purpose of 
their expedition. A serious question now arose among 
the leaders. The order, directing the expedition, desig- 
nated Bunker's Hill as the position to be taken and forti- 
fied. But it was perceived at once, by the experienced 
eye of the sagacious men, who influenced that little coun- 
cil, that intrenchments upon that elevation would be of 
little avail, unless the advance post on Breed's Hill was 
first secured. The water in the adjacent channel being 
very deep, the Neck and the Hill were completely com- 
manded by the ships-of-war on either side, while the dis- 
tance was too great to render the place of any advantage, 
in restraining and annoying the enemy in Boston, which, 
as well as the ships in the harbor, was easily commanded 
by Breed's. Much time was consumed in deliberation, 
before they could decide upon taking the responsibility of 



166 LiFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

deviating from the letter of their orders, and acting upon 
their own judgments. It was only after repeated and 
urgent warnings from Colonel Grid ley, that longer delay 
would defeat their plans altogether, not leaving them time 
enough to complete their fortifications, that they came to a 
decision. They then yielded to the bolder counsels of 
Putnam, to occupy first the position nearest the enemy, 
with a view to erecting the principal work there, and a 
subsidiary one on Bunker's Hill, for the protection of the 
rear, and as a rallying point in the event of their being 
driven from the other. 

Having arrived at this decision, Colonel Gridley pro- 
ceeded immediately to lay out the works, which he plan- 
ned with a genius and skill, that would have done honor to 
the most experienced engineer in the veteran armies of 
the old world. The redoubt on the summit of the hill 
was about eight rods square. The southern face, looking 
towards Charlestown, was deemed the most important, 
and consequently was furnished with the strongest defence. 
The eastern side commanded a very extensive field, 
stretching down towards Morton's point. In a line with 
this, running down the northern declivity of the hill to the 
slough, a breastwork was thrown up, separated from the 
redoubt, at its southern extremity, by a narrow passage- 
way, or sally port, protected in front by a blind. In the 
rear of the redoubt, was a passage, or gate-way, opening 
toward the slough. 

It was midnight, before the first spade entered the 
ground. It was then within four days of the Summer 
Solstice. They had, consequently, but about four hours 
to work, before the dawning light would disclose their 
operations to the enemy, and expose them to an immedi- 
ate cannonading from the batteries in Boston, and the 
ships in the harbor. But, such was the spirit and resolu- 



SURPRISE OF THE BRITISH. 167 

tion of the whole party, officers and men, that the work 
was effected in that brief space. Instructed and stimulated 
by Putnam and Prescott, who did not fear a spade, or a 
pick-axe, any more than a sword or a musket ; and feel- 
ing that life and liberty alike depended on their success, 
they performed prodigies of labor, during that notable 
night surpassed only by the prodigies of valor, by which 
they signalized the following day. The works being in a 
state of promising forwardness, and every man cheerfully 
doing his whole duty, Putnam repaired to his camp, at an 
early hour, to make all necessary preparations for the 
coming crisis. 

The crisis came with the dawning light. When the 
British officers, aroused at peep of day by their startled 
sentinels, beheld their daring foes above them, overlooking 
their whole position with formidable entrenchments, which 
had sprung up as by enchantment in the night, they could 
scarcely credit the evidence of their own senses. It was 
instantly perceived, that, if the Americans were not driven 
from their bold position at once, Boston would be no longer 
tenable by the British. A council of war was called, 
which directed an immediate assault. 

Meanwhile, as preparations for the assault were going 
on, a brisk but unavailing fire was opened upon the Ame- 
ricans, from the armed vessels and floating batteries, and 
from the battery on Copp's Hill. No sooner did the report 
of this cannonade reach the ear of Putnam, than he has- 
tened back to the scene of action. The streets of Boston 
were in full view ; and the busy preparations of the Bri- 
tish were easily discerned and understood. It was mani- 
fest that they were soon to come to the trial of strength 
with the veteran troops of the old world. The prospect 
inspired Prescott with new ardor ; but some of his officers, 
fearing that men, who were exhausted by the unintermit- 



168 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

ted toils of the night, and who were now entirely without 
water and provisions, would be incapable of performing 
the service required of them, earnestly desired that a 
request should be sent to the' camp for their relief. Pres- 
cott refused to admit the proposition, declaring that the 
men who had raised the works were best able to defend 
them, and best entitled to the honors of victory. After 
much persuasion, however, he consented to despatch a 
messenger to General Ward for refreshments. This mes- 
senger was Major Brooks, afterwards distinguished by his 
faithful services in war, as well as by the highest civil 
honors in the State. 

General Putnam, on discovering the design of the ene- 
my, returned immediately to Cambridge, and urgently 
advised that a reinforcement should be sent to Colonel 
Prescott's aid, and that his men should be supplied with 
suitable refreshment, before the action should commence. 
His application for reinforcements was unsuccessful. Gene- 
ral Ward was strongly impressed with the idea that the Bri- 
tish would land on Lechemere's Point, or Inman's farm, in 
Cambridge, and make an assault upon the camp, and so cut 
off the rear of the party in Charlestown. He was the more 
convinced of this, as the scanty depots of ammunition and 
military stores, on which the salvation of the American 
army depended, were at Cambridge and Watertown, and 
the. British could in no way gain so decided an advantage 
over them, as by securing or destroying them. And this 
had been the direct object of all their active operations 
hitherto. It appears, also, that a formidable party in 
General Gage's council of war, among whom were Gene- 
rals Clinton and Grant, were urgently in favor of making 
their attack at this place. Ward, therefore, thought it 
unsafe to weaken his own force, as that would not only 
invite an attack, but render it difficult to repel it. On the 



HIS POSITION IN THIS BATTLE. 1G9 

same grounds, he resisted the earnest solicitation of Put- 
nam's troops to follow their commander to the battle, 
assuring them that theirs was the post of danger, and, 
consequently, of honor. 

Such being the position of the army, it is manifest that 
Putnam, though he superintended the expedition to fortify 
the hill, had no definite command in the battle which 
ensued. His camp and his men, with the exception of 
Captain Knowlton's company, were at Inman's Farm, a 
point which General Ward regarded as most liable to 
attack, and most important to be defended. On that 
point, it was necessary that General Putnam should keep 
a watchful eye, in order to prevent a surprise. His atten- 
tion was, consequently, divided .between his own post 
which it was his first duty to defend and the scene of 
the battle, from which he could not persuade himself to 
be absent. And it was not until the British had landed, 
and the fight commenced, that he was relieved from all 
apprehension in relation to the expected attack upon his 
own camp, and at liberty to give his undivided attention to 
the enemy. 

The cannonading from the British ships and floating 
batteries, though kept up incessantly during all the morn- 
ing, effected nothing. The Americans kept on steadily at 
their works, suffering more from hunger and fatigue, than 
from the fire or the fear of the enemy. Putnam was very 
anxious to avail himself of the time required for the Bri- 
tish troops to prepare for engagement, to throw up another 
redoubt, according to the original plan, and in obedience 
to orders, on Bunker Hill. He, accordingly, with a hand- 
ful of men, commenced an intrenchment on that summit, 
which, if it could have been completed so far as to afford 
a tolerable protection to his troops, would have enabled 
him to check the advance of the British, and prevent them 
8 



170 'LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

from occupying the redoubt on Breed's Hill. The two 
summits were within gun-shot of each other, the former, 
which was nearly thirty feet higher, having complete com- 
mand of the latter. 

It was late before this intrenchment was begun, and 
other and warmer work soon required its abandonment. 
A little after noon, a large detachment of British soldiers, 
under command of General Howe, supported by General 
Pigot, Colonels Nesbit, Abercrombie and Clarke, and other 
distinguished officers, landed on Morton's Point. The 
breastwork, extending from Prescott's Redoubt to the 
slough, still left an undefended pass over the " ridge," 
towards Bunker's Hill. Putnam instantly ordered Captain 
Knowlton to cover that pass, for which purpose an extem- 
pore and perfectly original defence was constructed. A 
rail fence, which traversed " the ridge," was pulled up 
and placed a few feet from another of the same kind, and 
the intermediate space filled in with new mown hay. 
Behind this shadowy parapet, they watched the move- 
ments of the enemy, prepared and resolved to give him a 
worthy reception, as soon as he should be ready to ad- 
vance. 

The rumor of a probable engagement spread rapidly on 
every side ; and marty* private citizens, as well as some 
brave officers not on duty, flew to arms, and volunteered 
their services. "Of the latter were Generals Warren and 
Pomeroy, each with his musket and cartridges, prepared 
for the hardest service, and inspiring, with their presence 
and their \vords, a new courage into the hearts of the 
brave men, whose deeds of valor and self-sacrifice were to 
consecrate that day to the cause of liberty. 

When Warren came upon the field, he was met by 
Putnam, who said to him : " I am sorry to see you here, 
General Warren. I wish you had left the day to us, as I 



WARREN AND POMEROY, VOLUNTEERS. 171 

advised you. From appearances, we shall have a sharp 
time of it. But, since you are here, I will receive your 
orders with pleasure." Warren replied : " I came only 
as a volunteer ; I know nothing of your dispositions, and 
will not interfere with them ; tell me where I can be most 
useful." 

Putnam, intent on his safety, directed him to the re- 
doubt, observing, " You will be covered there." " Do 
not think," replied Warren, " I come here to seek a place 
of safety ; but tell me where the onset will be most furi- 
ous." Putnam again pointed to the redoubt ; " That," 
said he, " is the enemy's object. Prescott is there, and 
will do his duty. If that can be defended, the day is 
ours ; but, from long experience of the character of the 
enemy, I think they will ultimately succeed, and drive us 
from the works ; though, from the mode of attack which 
they have chosen, we shall be able to do them infinite 
injury ; and we must be prepared for a brave and orderly 
retreat, when we can maintain our ground no longer." 

Warren assented to his opinions, nnd, promising to be 
governed by them, went on to the redoubt. The soldiers, 
to many of whom he was well known, received him with 
loud huzzas. Prescott offered him the command, which 
he declined ; saying, that he had come only as a volun- 
teer, and " was happy to learn service from a soldier of 
experience."* 

The veteran General Pomeroy, on hearing the distant 
roar of the artillery, borrowed a horse to carry him to the 
field. On approaching the neck, which was swept by a 
tremendous firing from the British ships, he became, alarm- 
ed, not for his own safety, but for that of the horse he had 
borrowed. He, accordingly, left his charger in charge of 
K sentinel, and coolly walked over, mounted the hill, and

172 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

advanced to the rail fence. He was received with the 
highest exultation, and the name of Pomeroy rang through 
the line.* 

While these accessions were making to the American 
forces, and the British, already landed, were waiting for 
reinforcements, Putnam had twice ridden to head-quarters, 
to represent the absolute necessity of a competent force to 
resist the superior numbers of the enemy. His represen- 
tations were at last effectual, and General Ward ordered 
the New Hampshire troops at Medford, under Colonels 
Stark and Reed, to repair to the scene of action. Colonels 
Little, Brewer and Gardner, with their respective com- 
mands, were successively brought into the field ; and 
these were ultimately followed by Putnam's Connecticut 
troops, under Captains Coit, Chester and Clarke, and the 
heroic Major Durkee. Before the action commenced, 
Putnam was employed in assigning these successive par- 
ties to their posts, and giving a general direction to the 
arrangements of the forces, not under the immediate com- 
mand of Prescott. Warren and Pomeroy were with that 
officer in the redoubt, but each declined taking the com- 
mand, affirming that it was justly due to him who had 
constructed the defences. Putnam was the only general 
officer on the field without, and was drawn into the hot- 
test of the engagement, as soon as it was ascertained that 
the whole force of the British was to be concentrated 
against Charlestown. Until the drums beat to arms, he 
did not wholly abandon the prosecution of his works of 
intrenchment. At that signal he hastened to the lines. 

The British van soon appeared in view. The Ameri- 
cans, eager to salute them, were with difficult}' restrained 
from firing too soon. General -Putnam rode alon<r the 
line, giving strict orders that no one should fire till the

enemy had arrived within eight rods, nor then, till the 
word of command should be given. " Powder is scarce," 
said he, " and must not be wasted. Do not fire at the 
enemy till you see the whites of their eyes then fire 
low take aim at their waistbands aim at the handsome 
coats pick off the commanders." The same orders were 
given by Prescott, Pomeroy, Stark, and all the veteran 
officers. 

The effect of these orders was tremendous. With a 
bold and confident front, assured of an easy victory over 
the raw, undisciplined troops of the Provinces, the British 
troops advanced to the fatal line, eight rods in advance of 
the defences, when a well-aimed volley from the deadly 
muskets within, swept away the whole front rank, and laid 
many a gallant officer in the dust. Rank succeeded rank, 
and volley following volley mowed them down, till at 
length they were compelled to retreat. 

The American army was somewhat deficient of artillery, 
and the pieces they had on the field were neither well 
provided, nor well manned. Captain Callender carried his 
pieces into the action, but, finding that his cartridges re- 
quired adjusting, was retiring, in violation of orders, to 
the cover of the hill, to put them in order for use. Put- 
nam observed this movement, and instantly ordered him to 
his post. Callender remonstrated, but Putnam threatened 
him with instant death, if he hesitated, and thus forced 
him back to his post. His men, however, who had not 
been trained to the use of artillery, were disgusted with a 
service which they did not understand ; and, as most of 
them had muskets, they mingled with the infantry, desert- 
ing their pieces altogether.* 

* This story of Callender should never be told without its sequel. 
It illustrates the truth of the remark, which an old writer has made, 
that " unquestioned circumstances, and even the verdict of an impar- 



174 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Three times did the brave veterans of the British retreat 
before the deadly fire of the American militia, with the 
loss of whole ranks of men, and the very elite of their 
officers ; and three times, in the face of this almost certain 
death, they returned to the charge. They had expected 
an easy victory, and promised themselves that, at the first 
approach of a regular army, the raw, undisciplined Ame- 
ricans would fly like frightened sheep. They now found, 
no less to their cost than to their surprise, that they had 

tial jury, may misrepresent a man's real character, and affix a stigma 
to his name, to which every other act of his life, before and after, 
shall give the lie direct." Cullender was tried before a court-martial, 
on a charge of cowardice, and cashiered. He bore his disgrace with 
that moral fortitude, which is generally of a higher character than 
personal bravery. He instantly enlisted as a common soldier in the 
company he had commanded, and followed the fortunes of the war. 
The soldiers treated him with the greatest respect, as did the officers 
of the company also, believing him to be a brave and an honorable 
man. It was not long before he had an opportunity to show the spirit 
that was in him. He distinguished himself in several skirmishes ; 
and, on one occasion, when his commanders were all killed, and his 
comrades had retreated, he alone, in the face of the advancing enemy, 
loaded and fired his piece, and continued to do so, while his ammuni- 
tion lasted. When that failed, he mounted his piece, resolved to be 
found there, and there only, and thus give the lie to the unjust sen- 
tence under which he was suffering. His gallant conduct attracted 
the notice of the British officer, who was opposed to him, and so 
commanded his admiration, that he ordered his men not to fire upon 
the unarmed and solitary hero. He took him under his immediate 
protection, gave him a letter to General Washington, stating the facts 
relative to his capture, and dismissed him without an exchange. That 
noble-hearted chieftain received Callender with open arms, and with 
tears of joy, restored his commission, allowing him to take rank from 
its original date before the Battle of Bunker Hill, at the same tune 
ordering his sentence to be erased from the Orderly Book. Callen- 
der remained in the army after the peace, being one of the few 
whom the old Congress retained, and he died in the service on the 
peace establishment.

men to deal with, and that courage, daring, and the highest 
heroism, were less a matter of training than of principle. 
As Colonel Abercrombie led up his men to the charge, he 
was saluted by a familiar stentorian voice from the redoubt, 
reminding him, probably, of a reproachful epithet he had 
applied to his enemies, " Colonel Abercrombie, are the 
Yankees cowards ?"* 

Hitherto the British had neglected the only manoeuvre, 
by which they could possibly defeat their enemy, so 
long as their ammunition should last. This was to charge 
with the bayonet. The Americans were wholly unpro- 
vided with bayonets, and therefore could not resist or with- 
stand a charge. But this the assailants did not know. 
They relied upon their fire, which was for the most part 
aimless and ineffectual, while every shot from the redoubt, 
the breast-work, and the rail-fence, being reserved and de- 
liberate, found its victim. 

While these terrible scenes were enacting, several rein- 
forcements arrived from Boston, to the aid of the British, 
till their whole number amounted to not less than eight 
thousand. To add new horrors to the scene, vast columns 
of smoke were observed over Charlestown, and the village 
was seen to be on fire in several places. General Howe, 
on his first advance, had sent word to Generals Bur- 
goyne and Clinton, that his left flank was much annoyed 
by an incessant discharge of musketry frpm Charlestown, 
and ordered them to burn it down. A carcass was accord- 
ingly fired from Copp's Hit!, but it fell short. A second, 
with better aim, took effect. The conflagration was com-

Somerset man-of-war. Under cover of the smoke, the 
enemy hoped to be able to gain the rear of the Americans, 
unperceived. But a sudden change of wind revealed their 
movements, and defeated their purpose. 

Putnam, who had been active in every part of the field, 
now encouraging and stimulating his men to do their whole 
duty, now seeking and bringing up the reinforcements, and 
directing them where their services were most needed, un- 
dertook, with his usual promptness, to arrest this new 
movement of the enemy. Callender's deserted cannon 
were near the foot of Bunker's Hill, when Captain Ford 
appeared with his company, marching over the hill. Put- 
nam, delighted with so opportune an accession to his 
strength, ordered them to man the cannon, and draw them 
into the line. After a brief remonstrance, on the score of 
their ignorance of the discipline and employment of artil- 
lery, they obeyed the order, and moved with the cannon, 
and the General himself, first to the rail-fence, and then to 
the brow of the hill, overlooking Charlestown. Here he 
opened a deadly fire upon the detachment of incendiaries. 
Their cartridges were few and soon expended ; but the 
pieces were well-aimed, General Putnam dismounting and 
pointing them himself, and every ball took effect. One 
cannister was so well directed that it made a complete 
lane through the columns of the enemy, and threw them 
into momentary confusion. With wonderful courage, 
however, they closed their ranks, and advanced again to 
the charge. The Americans, their cartridges being spent, 
resorted to their muskets, and suffering their assailants to 
approach still nearer than before, poured in a volley with 
such deliberate aim, that the front rank was swept wholly, 
away, and officers and men fell in promiscuous heaps. 

The pieces belonging to Captain Gridley's company, 
having been furnished with some cartridges that were too 



A FRESH SUPPLY OF POWDER. 177 

large for use in the ordinary way, the pieces were desert- 
ed, and the company scattered. Putnam coming up, an- 
grily demanded where the officers were. On being in- 
formed of the difficulty, he protested it was no difficulty at 
all, and that the pieces could and should be loaded. Dis- 
mounting, and taking one of the condemned cartridges, he 
broke it open, loaded the piece with a ladle, and fired it. 
This he did several times, and with good effect. 

In the midst of this thunder of artillery and rattling of 
musketry, the sulphurous smoke rolling up in heavy vol- 
umes, and the balls whistling by on every side, Captain 
Foster, of Colonel Mansfield's regiment, arrived with a 
supply of powder from the American camp. It was 
brought in casks in wagons, and distributed loose to the 
soldiers, as they were able to take it ; some receiving it in 
their horns, some in their pockets, and some in their hats, 
or whatever else they had that would hold it.* 

More than a thousand of the best of the British troops 
had now fallen before the murderous fire of an enemy, 
whom they affected to despise as peasants and rebels. 
Among these, was a large number of their bravest and 
most accomplished officers. Major Small, an old acquaint- 
ance and friend of General Putnam, was left standing 
alone, every one having been shot down about him, and 
he a prominent mark for the next shaft of death. The

those busy in this work, not unlike those engaged in the delivery of 
coal in a hot summer's day. At the same time we were thus occu- 
pied, the enemy's shot were constantly whistling by; but we had no 
time to examine their character or dimensions. I have often thought 
what might have been our condition, had one of their hot shot uncere- 
moniously come in contact with oar wagons."

never-erring muskets were already levelled at him, and a 
certain death seemed instantly to await him ; when Put- 
nam, coming up, immediately recognized him as an old 
friend and fellow-soldier, and making a sign to his men to 
spare him, suffered him to escape unharmed.* 

In the same spirit of generous chivalry, the brave and 
distinguished Colonel Abercrombie, who received his 
death-wound in front of the redoubt, remembered his old 
friend and comrade, General Putnam, to whom he was 
devotedly attached, and, with his dying breath, enjoined 
it upon his surrounding countrymen to treat him with 
kindness and respect, on his account. " If you take Gene- 
ral Putnam alive, '* said he, " do not hang him, for he is a 
brave fellow, "f A striking comment upon the characters 
of the two heroes, as well as upon the summary mode of 
treatment which the British then designed to adopt with 
their principal captives. 

Meanwhile, the Americans, protected by their entrench- 
ments, had sustained but little loss. But now the crisis 
was to come. Their ammunition was exhausted, and 
there was no alternative but to retreat. General Howe 
had learned, by a terrible experience, that it was vain to 
think of frightening the " undisciplined rebels " from their 
defences, by the mere smell of gunpowder. With the 
advice of the accomplished and chivalrous General Clin- 
ton, who had just come to his aid, he commanded the 
works to be scaled, and the enemy driven out at the point 
of the bayonet. He led the charge in person, as he had 
done before. General Clinton joined General Pigot, with 

This incident is established by the joint testimony of Colonel 
Small, who related it to Colonel Trumbull, in London, and of Colo- 
nel Daniel Putnam, to whom his father related it, a few days after 
the battle.

SCALING THE WORKS. 179 

a view to turn the right flank of the enemy. The artillery 
were ordered to advance, at the same time, turn the left 
of the breast-work, and rake the line. This was the most 
vulnerable point in the American defences, and had hitherto 
been wholly overlooked. 

The brave, and so far victorious, defenders of the soil, 
made every possible preparation to repel this last desperate 
effort of the assailants. Putnam hastened again to the 

O 

rear, and made every possible effort to bring on further 
reinforcements. In this, he was but partially successful ; 
but, with such as he could command, he returned to his 
charge. It was of little avail, however, for their powder 
was exhausted. They had sent in vain to the camp for a 
further supply. The magazine there was reduced to less 
than two barrels. The few who had a charge remaining, 
reserved their last fire till the artillery, now advancing to 
turn the flank of their breast-work, had approached within 
the prescribed distance. Then, every shot took effect. The 
gallant Howe, who had escaped unhurt hitherto, received 
one of the last of the American balls in his foot. 

The fire of the Americans gradually diminished, and 
then ceased. Instantly their muskets were clubbed, and 
the stones of their defences were seized, and hurled at the 
advancing foe. This only served to betray their weakness, 
and infused a new energy into their assailants. No longer 
exposed to that destructive fire, which had so fearfully 
thinned their ranks, they now marched forward, scaled the 
redoubt, and began the work of retribution. The artillery, 
advancing at the same instant to the open space on the 
north, between the breast-work and the rail fence, enfi- 
laded the line, and sent their balls through the open gate- 
way, or sally port, directly into the redoubt under cover 
of which the troops at the breast-work were compelled to 
retire. 



180 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

The heroic but ..diminutive Pigot was the first to scale 
the works. He was instantly followed by his men, now 
confident of an easy victory. Troops succeeded troops 
over the parapet, till that little arena, where the first great 
effort of American prowess was put forth, was filled with 
combatants, prepared to contest its possession. 

To contend, without a bayonet in his company, with 
such a superior force, would have been worse than mad- 
ness. Prescott saw this, and reluctantly ordered a retreat. 
He and Warren were the last to leave the redoubt. The 
latter seemed to disdain to fly, even when nothing else 
remained to him. With sullen reluctance he followed his 
countrymen to the port, which he had scarcely passed, 
when a ball from the enemy arrested him. Major Small, 
as a personal friend, and in return for the generous protec- 
tion he had just received from Putnam, endeavored to save 
him. But Warren would neither yield nor fly. He fell 
between the retreat and the pursuit, having won the re- 
spect of his enemies, and the everlasting gratitude of his 
countrymen, and leaving his name as one of the watch- 
words of liberty throughout the world. His death was 
deeply felt, and long lamented, by General Putnam, who 
was often heard to remark upon the similarity of his fate, 
to that of the gallant Lord Howe, \\ no fell at his side, in 
the old French War. Both of them were intimate friends, 
and with both he had earnestly remonstrated against the 
exposure of their persons to the danger, by which they 
were destined to fall. 

The retreating Americans were now between the two 
wings of the British army, so that they could not fire, 
without endangering the lives of each other. A brave 
and orderly retreat was effected. Putnam was exceed- 
ingly efficient and daring in assisting to bring up and pro- 
tect the rear. He had confidently hoped, a short time 



HIS POSITION IN THE RETREAT. 181 

before, that they would be able at least to maintain the 
ground, if not to secure the victory, and was now most 
unwilling to abandon it. The left wing, where his troops 
were stationed, was, from its position, the last to retreat, 
its flank being exposed by the retreat of the right wing. 
He threw himself between the retreating force and the 
enemy, who were but twelve rods from him, and seemed 
to brave their utmost fury. Not fully aware that their 
ammunition was quite exhausted, he entreated his coun- 
trymen to rally, and renew the fight. He urged them to 
finish his works on Bunker's Hill, and again give the ene- 
my battle on that unassailable position, and pledged his 
honor to restore to them an easy victory. He was the 
more encouraged to urge these propositions, as a new rein- 
forcement arrived from the camp, under command of 
Captain Smith. The retreat was inevitable, however, 
and the most these fresh troops could do, was to assist in 
keeping the enemy at bay, and defending from their fire, 
those who had neither powder nor bayonets to defend 
themselves. 

Putnam, though the balls fell around him like hail, was 
wholly insensible of danger. Coming to one of the de- 
serted field-pieces, he dismounted, took his stand by its 
side, and seemed resolved to brave the foe alone. One 
sergeant only dared to stand by him in this perilous position. 
He was soon shot down, and the General himself retired 
only when the British bayonets were close upon him, and 
he was in imminent danger of being made a prisoner. It 
is in this attitude of protecting the rear of our retreating 
troops, that General Putnam is represented by Trumbull, 
in his celebrated picture of this great battle. His figure is 
conspicuous, dressed in a light blue and scarlet uniform, 
with his head uncovered, and his sword waving towards 
the enemy, as if to arrest their impetuous pursuit, or defy 



182 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

their further advance. In nearly the same attitude he is 
exhibited by Barlow in " The Vision of Columbus :" 

" There strides bold Putnam, and from all the plains, 
Calls the third host, the tardy rear sustains, 
And, "mid the whizzing deaths that fill the air, 
Waves back his sword, and dares the following war." 

The Americans had retreated about twenty rods, before 
the enemy had time to rally. They were then suddenly 
exposed to a destructive fire, which proved more fatal to 
them than all the previous contest. Some of the best and 
bravest men were left on this part of the field, and several 
officers, whose behavior that day had given promise of the 
highest military distinction. The retreat was maintained 
in good order, over the Neck, to Prospect and Winter 
Hills, where they took up their position for the night, 
throwing up hasty intrenchments, which were soon 
strengthened and fortified, so as to present to the enemy 
another line of defence, equally formidable with that 
which they had just purchased at the expense of so much 
blood. 

In presenting this brief sketch of the Battle of Bunker 
Hill, that fulness and completeness of detail has not been 
aimed at, which is essential to a perfect historical narra- 
tive, and which alone can do justice to all the actors in 
this opening scene in the drama of the Revolution. Our 
special business is with General Putnam, and the details 
of the battle are gone into only so far as is necessary to 
exhibit, in its true light, the part which he bore in the con- 
flict.* It would, however, be doing unnecessary violence 
to the common sentiment of patriotic gratitude, on the part 
both of writer and reader, to leave the glorious field with- 
out bearing testimony to the heroism, valor, and endu- 
rance, of the many brave compeers of our hero, who will

ESTIMATES OF THE RESULT. 183 

continue, to the end of time, to share with him the glory 
of one of the hardest fought, and most unequal, battles re- 
corded on the page of history. The names of Prescott, of 
Warren, of Pomeroy, of Gridley, of Stark, of Frye, of 
Bridge, of Gardiner, of Knowlton, of Durkee, and many 
others, will be held in grateful and honored remembrance, 
while the cause of freedom is dear to the heart of man. 
It is true, they lost the field but they gained the day, 
and made it a marked day in the calendar of the nations 
They were dislodged from their defences, but not defeated 
They were driven back, but not vanquished. And though 
the proud Briton claimed to himself a victory, in gaining 
possession of the ground, he was himself compelled to 
acknowledge, that a few more such victories would ruin 
him, and leave his rebel antagonist master of the whole 
field. 

It appears, from General Gage's official account of the 
battle, that the numbers of the Americans engaged in it 
were greatly overrated by the British ; unless, indeed; the 
statement is to be regarded as a convenient fiction, to cover 
his own chagrin at the result. " This action," he says, 
" has shown the superiority of the king's troops, who, 
under every disadvantage, attacked and defeated above 
three times their own number, strongly posted and covered 
by breast-works." 

In his letter to Lord Dartmouth, accompanying this ac- 
count, he somewhat inconsistently observes, " The suc- 
cess, of which I send your Lordship an account by the 
present opportunity, was very necessary in our present 
situation, and I wish most sincerely that it had not cost us 
so dear. The number of killed and wounded is greater 
than our forces can nfford to lose. The trials we have 
had show the rebels are not the despicable rabble too 
many supposed them to be. When they find cover, they 



184 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

make a good stand, and the country, naturally strong, 
affords it to them ; and they are taught to assist its natu- 
ral strength by art, for they intrench, and raise batteries. 
Your Lordship will perceive that the conquest of this 
country is not easy, and can be effected only by time and 
perseverance, and strong armies attacking it in various 
quarters, and dividing their forces." 

In the account transmitted to the Continental Congress, 
by the Congress of Massachusetts, are the following 
remarks : " With a ridiculous parade of triumph, the min- 
isterial generals again took possession of the hill, which 
had served them as a retreat, in their flight from the battle 
of Concord. It was expected that they would prosecute 
the supposed advantage they had gained, by marching 
directly to Cambridge, which was not then in a state of 
defence. This they failed to do. The wonder, excited 
by such conduct, soon ceased, when we were told, that of 
three thousand men,* who marched out upon this expedi- 
tion, no less than fifteen hundred were killed or wounded, 
and about twelve hundred of them either killed or mor- 
tally wounded. Such a slaughter was perhaps never 
before made upon British troops, by about fifteen hundred 
men, which were the most that were at any time engaged 
on the American side." 

* It was afterwards ascertained, upon good authority, that the 
number of the British was five thousand. That of the Americans 
fluctuated. There were probably as many as thirty-five hundred on 
the hill, during the day, though numbers of them took no active part 
in the battle, and a considerable detachment arrived only in season to 
cover the retreat.

THE war had now commenced in serious earnest ; and 
there was no amicable retreat from the positions mutually 
taken, without such concessions of principle, as neither of 
the contending parties could be reasonably expected to 
make. The appeal to arms, forced upon the colonies by 
the stringent and unyielding policy of the mother-country, 
and hurried to a crisis by the rash and ill-advised mea- 
sures of the representatives of royal power, was solemnly 
accepted, and the issue fearlessly referred to the decision 
of that all-wise Providence, that guides and controls the 
affairs of nations, and of men. 

The colonies were as yet distinct Provinces, having 
many common interests and sympathies, but no common 



Ji86 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

bond of union. There were different shades and degrees 
of attachment to the crown, and widely varying convictions 
of the " divine right " of kings. But there was an almost 
universal sentiment of the injustice and inequality of the 
ministerial policy, and a general and determined resolution 
to maintain the divine rights of the subject, at whatever 
cost to themselves, or to the assumed and unconstitutional 
prerogatives of the throne. This had been boldly, but 
respectfully expressed in all the colonies. But, hitherto, 
there had been no concert of action, with a view to forci- 
ble resistance. A Congress of the several colonies was 
now in session at Philadelphia, but without any certain 
and well denned powers to bind the colonies to any mea- 
sures which they might recommend. The Provincial 
Congress of Massachusetts had proposed a definitive alli- 
ance, and " the establishment of such a form of federal 
government, as should promote the union and interests of 
all America ;" declaring, at the same time, their own 
readiness to " submit to such general plan as the Congress 
might direct." This was the voice of New England, now 
involved in actual war. It demanded immediate action on 
the part of the sister colonies. Nor did their delegates in 
Congress hesitate a moment what course to pursue. They 
determined immediately and unanimously, that, as hostili- 
ties had actually commenced, and large reinforcements to 
the British army were instantly expected, they should be 
immediately put in a state of defence. They assumed 
command of the army, made provision for its increase and 
support, and appointed George Washington, then a Colo- 
nel in the Provincial ranks of Virginia, to be Commander- 
in-chief of all the American forces. 

General Washington arrived in the camp, at Cambridge, 
and took command of the army on the 2d of July. He 
brought with him commissions from the Continental Con- 



HIS PROMOTION AS MAJOR-GENERAL. 187 

gress for four Major-Generals, and for other officers of 
inferior grade. The four superior stations were assigned 
to Ward, Lee, Schuyler, and Putnam. Pomeroy, Mont- 
gomery, Wooster, Heath, Spencer, Thomas, Sullivan, and 
Greene, were made Brigadiers ; and Gates an Adjutant- 
General, with the rank of Brigadier. 

These appointments, as they disturbed the relative posi- 
tion of some of the officers then in the service, occasioned 
much dissatisfaction, and called for all the wisdom and 
prudence of Washington, to adjust and harmonise their 
differences. Putnam's commission he handed to him im- 
mediately on his arrival at Head Quarters. The others 
he took the responsibility of withholding, till he could 
have time to consult Congress further upon the subject. 
Meanwhile, these appointments had been publicly an- 
nounced in the newspapers, and commented upon in pri- 
vate correspondence. The pride of military rank was 
touched in its most sensitive point. Personal honor, which 
always divides, with the glory and interest of his country, 
the soldier's heart, was deeply aggrieved, and demanded 
to be heard in its own defence. This is a worthy principle, 
and should not be lightly overlooked. It is not always 
purely selfish. A strict regard to its claims is absolutely 
essential to the maintenance of that profound respect and 
prompt subordination, without which there can be no such 
thing as discipline, order, or efficiency in the military 
establishment. It should never, therefore, be looked upon 
as a matter of mere personal etiquette, or a question of 
form. It has higher and more extended relations, whose 
delicacy and intrinsic importance can be duly estimated 
only by those who have had large experience in the ser- 
vice of the camp and the field. 

Some of the most valuable officers in the provincial ser- 
vice left the camp in disgust among whom were Thomas, 



188 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Wooster, and Spencer. The two last named officers were 
superseded by the promotion of General Putnam, who was 
of a lower grade in the provincial establishment. Spencer 
retired from his post, without waiting the arrival of the 
commander-in-chief, or leaving any formal announcement 
of his resignation. The officers under his immediate com- 
mand addressed a letter to the President of the Provincial 
Congress, speaking in the highest terms of respect, admi- 
ration and confidence towards their General, and deprecat- 
ing his resignation, as not only a source of grief and solici- 
tude to themselves, but a calamity to the high and holy 
cause, in whose defence they were all enlisted. A similar 
representation was made on the part of those more imme 
diately interested in the reputation and services of General 
Wooster. 

A Committee was immediately appointed by that body,* 
with instructions to write to the Continental Congress in 
relation to the matter, acquainting them with the high 
estimation in which Wooster and Spencer were, universally 
held, " at the same time testifying their sense of the singu- 
lar merit of General Putnam ;" and expressing their ear- 
nest hope and desire, that some mode might be devised to 
reconcile these differences, without wounding the honor, 
or jeoparding the invaluable services, of any of those able 
and experienced officers, on whose cordial co-operation 
their hopes, under Providence, mainly depended. 

It is highly creditable to General Spencer's patriotism, 
as well as a proof of his high sense of General Putnam's 
extraordinary merit as an officer, that he soon returned to 
the army, and consented to serve under him whom he had 
formerly commanded. Thomas, also, after much persua- 
sion, returned to his post ; from which he was soon after 
promoted to a higher grade, with the distinguished honor

HIS WELL-EARNED REPUTATION. 189 

of succeeding Montgomery in the command of the Ame- 
rican forces before Quebec. Wooster, from his advanced 
age, declined any appointment on the continental establish- 
ment, though he rendered some service, as a provincial 
officer, in some of the subsequent, campaigns ; and ulti- 
mately fell, April 27, 1777, in a gallant attempt to repel a 
strong party of royalists, who, under command of General 
Tryon, made a descent upon Connecticut, to destroy the 
American stores at Danbury. 

General Putnam had now arrived at the highest grade 
of distinction, recognized in the American army. Widely 
known, and universally respected by his own countrymen, 
and equally respected and feared by the enemy, to whom 
he had been long and favorably known, as an officer of 
eminent courage and ability, his position was one well cal- 
culated to stimulate the enthusiastic ardor and emulation 
of the younger officers, and awaken the natural jealousy 
and discontent of those of equal age and experience, who 
were aspiring to the same honor, and whose long and ar- 
duous services were recognized and appreciated by the 
army and the country, as a just title to the best awards of 
fame. But his popularity was universal. Even those, 
who might then have envied him, did not presume to de- 
tract from his well-earned fame, or to breathe a whisper to 
his discredit, either as a citizen or as a soldier. He passed 
the ordeal of an eventful life, without a reproach. It was 
reserved for a malice, that could rankle, unseen and un- 
heard, in the heart, till almost thirty years had passed over

time, " speaks volumes of comfort to the illustrious, yet 
slandered living, showing how true merit outlives 
calumny, and receives its sure reward in the admiration 
of after ages." 

The case of Captain Callender has already been alluded 
to. His was by no means a solitary one. Probably no 
conflict in the history of the world, ever gave rise to so 
many charges of cowardice, and dereliction of duty, or was 
followed by a more severe and searching scrutiny into the 
conduct of those engaged in it, than that of Bunker Hill. 
The Colonists had not yet absolutely thrown off the yoke 
of England. There was still a great diversity of opinion, 
whether or not it would be necessary, or expedient, ulti- 
mately to do so. There were, consequently, among the 
supporters of the American cause, very different degrees 
of hostility to the king, and of military ardor and zeal, in 
opposing his unjust exactions. It was, therefore, often- 
times difficult to distinguish, with absolute certainty, be- 
tween friends and foes. In such circumstances, the con- 
duct of every individual was watched with the strictest 
scrutiny ; and every man, against whom the shadow of a 
charge could be raised by the most jealous defender of 
liberty, Avas arraigned before a court-martial, and subject- 
ed to a formal and severe trial. Even Colonel Bridge, not- 
withstanding the severity of his labors, and the dangerous 
and honorable wounds he had received, did not escape this 
ordeal. These trials were continued, without intermission, 
from the 7th of July to the 5th of October,! and so rigor- 
ously was the discipline of the camp sustained by the court, 
that offences, which would now be overlooked, or visited 
with a slight reprimand, were then punished with severity. 
In view of these facts, it is no small praise to the spirit of

ACQUAINTANCE WITH WASHINGTON. 191 

the men engaged in that conflict, that two only of the com- 
missioned officers were degraded from their rank, on the 
charge of cowardice, and that one of them, by nobly dis- 
proving, in his after-life, the charge which deprived him 
of his commission, compelled even his enemies to plead 
for its restoration. The other was regarded, by many of 
those who knew him best, as too harshly treated. Three 
others were found guilty of misconduct, and dismissed 
from the service, with an acknowledgment on the part of 
the court, that their errors were those of inexperience, 
rather than of cowardice. 

The British, having gained possession of the peninsula 
of Charlestown, proceeded to erect a strong fortification 
upon the summit of Bunker Hill, where Putnam had al- 
ready broken ground for them, and where, had he succeed- 
ed in his plan of intrenchments, he would undoubtedly 
have kept them at bay. The fortifications in Boston were 
also greatly strengthened, while the Provincial, now adopt- 
ed as the Continental army, was so posted in the circum- 
jacent country, as to form a complete blockade, except on 
the side of the sea. The Colonists, having no fleet, and 
the Castle being in the hands of the enemy, the British 
had free access to the port. 

Immediately on the arrival of Washington, the army 
was formed into three grand divisions, each consisting of 
about twelve regiments. Major-General Ward was ap- 
pointed to the command of the right wing, stationed at 
Roxbury and Dorchester. Major-General Lee commanded 
the left wing, stretching to the Mystic River ; and Major- 
General Putnam occupied an advanced post in the centre, 
within a few miles of the head-quarters of the commander- 
in-chief. 

Washington and Putnam were personally unknown to 
each other, until they met at Cambridge. The open, undis- 



192 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

guised frankness of the Yankee General, together with his 
great activity and personal industry, in everything per- 
taining to the army, soon attracted the attention, and won 
the approving smile, of his commander. An early inti- 
macy was formed between them, and a firm friendship 
established, which continued undisturbed, during the whole 
period of their eventful military service. It was not in 
Putnam's nature to be idle. Inured to habits of industry 
himself, he was an able and efficient director of the labors 
of others. He was as single-hearted, frank and generous, 
as he was bold and energetic. The men, under his direc- 
tion, worked with such hearty good will, and the works, 
on which they were engaged, advanced with such unusual 
rapidity and success, as to excite the admiration of Wash- 
ington, who, addressing General Putnam, as he passed 
around to inspect the works, remarked, " You seem to 
have the faculty, sir, of infusing your own industrious 
spirit into all the workmen you employ." In one of his 
letters from Cambridge, written about the same time, and 
addressed to the President of Congress, he speaks of Put- 
nam as " a most valuable man, and a fine executive offi- 
cer." The commendation of Washington was never 
thoughtlessly bestowed, and his confidence was so rarely 
misplaced, as to invest his judgment, and his penetration 
into the character of those about him, with an almost un- 
erring precision. 

Soon after the arrival of Washington, Putnam received 
an urgent invitation from his friend, Major Small, of the 
British army, to hold a conference with him, under the 
protection of a flag. By Washington's advice, he accept- 
ed the invitation, and, to his surprise, found that its prin- 
cipal object was to renew the attempt, which had already 
been fruitlessly made, to withdraw him from the cause he 
had espoused, and engage him on the side of the king. 



NEW FORTIFICATIONS. 193 

The most liberal promises were made, both of rank and 
emolument, including the most desirable provision for his 
sons, in case of his compliance. But they were all spurn- 
ed with contempt, and with the assurance, that nothing 
could win him back to his old allegiance, or induce him 
to lay down his arms, but an utter and eternal abandon- 
ment, on' the part of Great Britain, of those unrighteous 
principles of administration, which had given rise to the 
present contest, and to the maintenance of which every 
true American had pledged his fortune and his life. The 
nature and result of this conference were communicated 
to Washington, at whose suggestion the whole affair was 
kept secret, and remained so for many years. 

Intrenchments were already thrown up on Winter and 
Prospect Hills about a mile westward from that division 
of the enemy which lay on the Peninsula of Charlestown, 
and in full view of it. Eastwardly of the works on Winter 
Hill, towards Mystic River, redoubts were thrown up, to 
prevent the enemy from passing up that river, or effecting 
a landing opposite the fort on the hill. At Ploughed Hill, 
much in advance of Prospect Hill, and within half a mile, 
on a direct line, of the British intrenchments on Bunker 
Hill, a formidable breast-work was thrown up, in the face 
of an incessant cannonade from the enemy's works. Put- 
nam was exceedingly active and energetic in forwarding 
the completion of these defences ; not only directing others 
in their toils, but putting his own hands to the work, like 
one who felt that there was dignity in labor, when conse- 
crated to a holy cause. " On one occasion," says the 
Rev. Mr. Harvey, " he came along near where I was at 
work, and, seeing a quantity of sods which had just been 
brought up, he addressed himself to one of the men, direct- 
ing him to place them on the wall ; remarking at the 
same time, ' You are a soldier, I suppose ?' The order 
M

not being executed on the instant, the General added, 
'Oh ! I see you are an officer,' and immediately took hold, 
and placed the sods himself. Meanwhile, the balls were 
continually pouring in from the British forts ; sometimes 
killing our men, and sometimes tearing our works ; but 
they went forward, nevertheless, and were soon in a con- 
dition to return the compliment."* 

About the 20th of July, the declaration of the Conti- 
nental Congress, setting forth the grievances of the coun- 
try, and the reasons which rendered necessary a resort to 
arms, was read before the several divisions of the army. 
The paper concluded with the following noble sentiments : 
" In our own native land, in defence of the freedom that 
is our birthright, and which we ever enjoyed until the 
late violation of it ; for the protection of our property, 
acquired solely by the honest industry of our forefathers 
and ourselves ; against violence actually offered, we have 
taken up arms. We shall lay them down when hostilities 
shall cease on the part of the aggressors, and all danger of 
their being renewed shall be removed, and not before. 

" With an humble confidence in the mercies of the 
Supreme and impartial Judge and Ruler of the Universe, 
we most devoutly implore his divine goodness, to conduct 
us happily through this great conflict, to dispose our adver- 
saries to reconciliation on reasonable terms, and thereby 
to relieve the empire from the calamities of civil war."

Revolution, who, on the llth of July, 1846, completed his lllth year. 
He is hale and hearty, and in perfect possession of his faculties. All 
that is here referred to him as authority, was taken down from his 
own lips by the compiler, during his visit to New York, in May. 
When requested to state, in a few words, his own estimate of the 
character of Putnam, and of his standing in the regards of his coun- 
trymen, he replied, with the solemn emphasis of an aged prophet, 
" He was a man animated for the good of his countrv." 



I 



ENTHUSIASM OF THE ARMY. 195 

Agreeably to orders previously issued by General Put- 
nam, the troops under his immediate command were 
assembled in full parade on Prospect Hill, on this occa- 
sion. When the last words of the declaration were pro- 
nounced, the whole division, at a signal from the general, 
shouted in unison their loud and thrice repeated Amen to 
its solemn appeal to heaven. At the same instant, a gun 
.vas fired from the fort, and the new standard, just receiv- 
ed from Connecticut, was run up, and, unfolding itself to 
the air, displayed on one side, the motto, in letters of gold, 
" An Appeal to Heaven ;" and on the other, the armorial 
bearings of Connecticut consisting of three vines, with- 
out supporters or crest, with the motto " Qui transtulit^ 
sustinet ;"* a beautiful allusion to the confidence our pil- 
grim fathers placed in the protecting care of providence, 
and to the three allegorical scions, Knowledge, Liberty, 
and Religion, which they had transplanted to America. 

An animated, pathetic, and highly patriotic address to 
the army, was then made by the Rev. Mr. Leonard, Chap- 
lain to General Putnam's division, followed by prayer. 
" The whole," says an eye-witness, " was conducted with 
the utmost decency, good order and regularity, and to the 
universal acceptance of all present. And the Philistines 
on Bunker's Hill heard the shout of the Israelites, and 
oeing very fearful, paraded themselves in battle array. "f 

As evidence of the cheerful spirit and good humor, 
which prevailed at this time among the defenders of 
liberty, and a specimen of the manner in which Putnam 
encouraged his men, by endeavoring to make their toil a 
recreation, the following anecdote, related by the venera- 
ble Captain Foster, of Danvers, is given. Captain Foster 
belonged to Colonel Mansfield's regiment, which was sta-

196 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM 

tioned on Prospect Hill, within the command of General 
Putnam. By orders from the General, all the Captains 
were desired to meet. It was then stated to them that a 
secret and hazardous expedition was planned, and it was 
desired that one of their number should volunteer to take 
the command. 

After waiting a short time for his seniors to have an 
opportunity to offer, Captain Foster stepped forward with 
a proffer of his services. Six or eight men were drafted 
from each company They were ordered to arm and 
equip themselves completely, and repair to General Put- 
nam's quarters. On presenting themselves before his tent, 
the bluff old general came out, and reviewed them in due 
form ; when, having commended their spirit and good 
appearance, he ordered them to lay aside their arms and 
equipments, provide themselves with axes, and go into a 
neighboring swamp and cut a quantity of fascines, which 
they were to bring in upon their shoulders. The men 
expected to gain honor by their cheerful exposure to un- 
known dangers and hardships ; but their greatest danger 
was from the attacks of the musquitoes, and their greatest 
exposure was to the mirth of their fellow-soldiers. 

With a view to acting upon Boston, a large number of 
boats were prepared, and kept in readiness in Charles 
River. It was a part of Putnam's duty, as commanding 
officer at this station, to exercise his men in the proper 
management and discipline of these boats. On one occa- 
sion, about the middle of July, it happened, that, in execut- 
ing a certain mano3uvre,one of the smaller boats, either from 
mistaking the order, or from want of skill in following it, 
ran athwart the track of the larger one, of which Putnam 
had the command. With his usual impetuosity, without 
checking his course in the least, or deviating from his 
track, he ran the disorderly shallop down, staving in her 



INCIDENTS AT COBBLE HILL. 197 

side, and tumbling her whole crew into the water. Hav- 
ing completed the movement he had ordered, the delin- 
quents were all carefully picked up, and cautioned to be, 
for the future, more attentive to the word of command. 

In November, General Putnam was ordered to erect 
another fortification on Cobble Hill. This was the spot 
where the Asylum for the Insane now stands. It was 
about the same distance from the British works on 
Charlestown heights, as Ploughed Hill, but nearer to 
those in Boston. As soon as the Americans were perceiv- 
ed to be engaged in this work, the British ships of war in 
Charles River, as well as the forts on Bunker's Hill, open- 
ed a severe fire upon them, which was kept up without 
respite during their entire progress. Captain Putnam, a 
son of the General, held a command at this post. As 
some of his men were one day reclining upon the green- 
sward, taking some refreshments, the General coming 
along, cried out " Up in a moment, or you are all dead 
men." They started up at the word, and hastened to their 
work. No sooner had they cleared the way, than a ball 
from the enemy ploughed the ground where they had been 
lying, and buried itself deep in the earth. It was thus 
necessary to keep a watchful eye to the side of the enemy, 
and to labor in the constant expectation of an iron mandate 
to abandon the work. It went forward, however, with 
the same rapidity and energy as all the others had done. 
The fort was soon completed and mounted affording ano- 
ther proof of the indomitable spirit and ready skill of the 
defenders of the soil. This fort was known, at the time, 
as " Putnam's impregnable fortress ;" while that at Pros- 
pect Hill, where Putnam held his quarters, is designated, 
in the correspondence of the day, as " our main fortress." 
This post was occupied by about one thousand men of the 
Connecticut Line the remainder being at Roxbury under 



198 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

General Ward. As soon as these works were completed, 
they opened their batteries upon the floating batteries of 
the British in Charles River, with such effect, as soon to 
drive them from their moorings. 

Not long after the works on Cobble Hill were complet- 
ed, General Putnam, wishing to give his men some active 
employment, of a more stirring character than digging 
trenches, or raising walls of earth and stone, sent out a 
small party, under Major Knowlton, who, passing across 
the mill-dam into Charlestown, attacked the advanced 
guard of the British, near the western base of Bunker Hill. 
They made several prisoners, set fire to the guard-house, 
tnd retired without receiving any injury to life or limb. 

This was on the 8th of January, 1776. The detach- 
ment marched between eight and nine o'clock in the even- 
ing. While engaged in executing its work, it was saluted 
by a brisk fire from the British garrison on the hill above. 
Those only, who are acquainted with the situation of Bun- 
ker Hill, and the places adjacent, at the time of this expe- 
dition, can fully appreciate the danger and delicacy of the 
task, so handsomely executed by Knowlton, and his brave 
associates. They passed from the main-land in Charles- 
town, over the mill-dam (the Neck being protected by the 
garrison), round the base of the hill, and directly under the 
garrison, which crowned its summit. They set fire to 
eight out of fourteen scattering houses, which were stand- 
ing in full view of the garrison, secured six prisoners, 
and effected an orderly retreat, under the very guns of the 
enemy's batteries which poured upon them an unremitted 
but ineffectual fire. 

On the evening, when this brilliant sortie was accom- 
plished, the farce of " The Blockade of Boston," of which 
General Burgoyne was the reputed author, was performed 
for the amusement of the British army. The person, de- 



SCENE IN THE BOSTON THEATRE. 199 

signed to burlesque General Washington, was dressed in 
the most uncouth style, with a large wig and a long rusty 
sword, and attended by an orderly sergeant, in a coarse 
country dress, having on his shoulder an old rusty gun, 
seven or eight feet long. At the moment when this figure 
appeared on the stage, one of the regular sergeants came 
running in, quite out of breath, with alarm depicted in his 
countenance, and, throwing down his bayonet, exclaimed, 
" The Yankees are attacking our works on Bunker Hill." 
Those of the audience, who were not familiar with the 
plot of the piece, supposed that this .was only a part of the 
farce. But when General Howe, rising suddenly in his 
place, called out, in tones of earnest command, " Officers, 
to your alarm posts " the play was instantly changed to 
a stern reality, having more resemblance to the fast ga- 
thering plot of some terrible tragedy, than to the laughter- 
provoking incidents of a broad farce. The theatre was 
all confusion and dismay officers and soldiers rushing this 
way and that, ladies shrieking and fainting, children 
screaming with terror, and all ranks and classes, in boxes, 
pit and stage, mingling frantically together, as if the thea- 
tre itself had been attacked, and delivered up to the tender 
mercies of war. 

The utmost industry, tact, and skill of the American 
commander, and his Generals, were now required, to in- 
crease, organize and discipline the army, and procure the 
necessary supply of arms, ammunition, and the various 
paraphernalia of war. Assembled, at a moment's warn- 
ing, from various quarters, enlisted for various terms, unac- 
customed to subordination and restraint, they neither felt 
the inclination, nor realized the importance, of a rigid sub- 
jection to military rules. Never, perhaps, in the history 
of the world, was an army assembled in the presence of 
an enemy, with so little preparation to sustain a regular 



200 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

campaign. Had that enemy been fully informed of the 
destitution of powder, of bayonets, and of other essential 
equipments in the camp, it is altogether improbable he 
would have remained quiet so long in his narrow quarters 
in Boston. It was a period of comparative inactivity to 
both armies, though by no means one of rest or indolence 
to the American officers. Besides his immediate duties 
in the camp, each one exerted all the influence he pos- 
sessed with his own colony, to procure the necessary sup- 
plies for the troops under his command. It is interesting 
to read the voluminous correspondence of the time. There 
are frequent letters from General Putnam to the Governor 
and Council of Connecticut, requesting supplies of powder, 
&c., and corresponding votes to meet the demand. One 
of the latter, which, for its considerate humanity, is worthy 
of particular mention, is a vote, passed on the 19th of July, 
ordering a sufficient number of tents to supply General 
Putnam's regiment, and directing that they should be 
made " by some of the poor tent-makers escaped from .Bos- 
ton."

EARLY in January, 1776, General Washington received 
unquestionable information, that an armament was equip- 
ping at Boston, to sail, under General Clinton, on a secret 
expedition. Many considerations induced him to believe, 
that the design of this movement was to take possession 
of New York, and establish the British Head Quarters 
there ; not only as a more commanding post, but as a more 
central theatre of operations against the now united colo- 
nies. He, therefore, ordered General Lee to repair imme- 
diately to that place, with such volunteers as he could 
assemble on his march, and to make the best arrangements 
for its defence that circumstances would permit. He was 
also instructed to disarm all disaffected persons, of whom 
there were known to be many in New York and espe- 
cially on Long Island and to collect the arms and ammu- 
nition in their possession, for the use of the continental 
army. 

General Lee found no difficulty in raising volunteers 



202 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

among the zealous patriots of Connecticut. At the head 
of twelve hundred men, he marched into New York, and 
commenced his works of defence in that city, on Long 
Island, and in the Highlands. It soon appeared, however, 
that General Clinton's expedition was destined farther 
south ; and Lee was ordered by Congress to take com- 
mand of the Southern department of the army. 

Meanwhile, the army and the people were growing 
restive under this long season of fruitless inactivity. They 
were anxious to come to another open conflict with the 
enemy, and to make a serious effort to dislodge him from 
his position in Boston, before he should be rendered im- 
pregnable by the large reinforcements which were expect- 
ed early in the spring. Washington was as desirous of an 
engagement as any one, and was deterred from making the 
attempt, only by the want of ammunition and arms, suita- 
ble to contend with an army so well provided as the Bri- 
tish. Congress had earnestly suggested the propriety of 
an attack, and Washington had digested a plan of opera- 
tions ; but, on laying it before a council of war, it was 
deemed altogether too hazardous to attempt, in the then 
condition of the army. 

Late in February, various appearances among the Bri- 
tish troops indicated an intention to evacuate Boston ; but, 
as these appearances might be deceptive, and as the ice 
now well formed in Charles River, and a small supply of 
powder recently received, favored his designs, General 
Washington determined to prosecute vigorously the plan 
he had formed to force General Howe either to come to 
an action, or to abandon his post. The regular conti- 
nental force now amounted to somewhat more than four- 
teen thousand men. In addition to these troops, the com- 
mander-in-chief called to his aid about six thousand of the 
militia of Massachusetts. Thus reinforced, he determined 



DORCHESTER HEIGHTS FORTIFIED. 203 

to take immediate possession of the Heights of Dorchester 
now known as South Boston and construct fortifica- 
tions there, from which he could greatly annoy the ships 
in the harbor, and the soldiers in the town. He was per- 
suaded that, by this means, a general action would be 
brought on, as the enemy must inevitably attempt to drive 
him from a position so dangerously near to their own 
camp. But in case he should fail in bringing on an en- 
gagement in this manner, he determined to make the forti- 
fication of the heights of Dorchester merely preparatory 
to seizing and fortifying Nook's Hill,* and the other points 
opposite the southern end of Boston. These eminences 
commanded entirely the harbor, a large part of the town, 
and the beach from which the enemy must embark, in the 
event of a retreat. 

To facilitate the execution of this plan, a heavy bom- 
bardment of the town, and the lines of the enemy, was 
commenced from the forts, on the night of the second 
of March, and was repeated the two succeeding nights. 
On the evening of the fourth, soon after the firing had 
begun, a large detachment, under the command of General 
Thomas, passed unperceived from Roxbury, and took 
possession of the heights without any opposition. Al- 
though the ground was frozen to a great depth, yet such 
was their activity and industry through the night, that a 
considerable breast-work was thrown up by morning, so 
as to nearly protect them from the shot of the enemy. 
When the pawning light revealed the position and works 
of the Americans, which were magnified to the view by a 
hazy atmosphere, the beleaguered British %ere no less 
embarrassed than astonished at the sight. They imme- 
diately commenced an ineffectual fire, which was returned 

That point where South Boston is connected with the peninsula 
by a bridge, called the South Boston Bridge. 



204 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

by those in possession of the heights, while they still con- 
tinued, with unremitting labor, to strengthen their position. 

This bold and successful movement of the American 
army left but two alternatives to the choice of the British 
commander. He was compelled either to dislodge the 
enemy from their new position, or to abandon his own ; 
and General Gage, as had been foreseen and desired by 
Washington, determined on the former alternative. Lord 
Percy, with about three thousand chosen men, consisting 
of parts of rive regiments, and the grenadiers and light 
infantry, was ordered on this service. The next day, the 
troops were embarked and fell down to the castle, in 
order to proceed up the river to the scene of action ; but 
a furious storm coming up, they were scattered, and pre- 
vented from prosecuting their enterprise at this time. 
Before they could be again in readiness for the attack, the 
works had been rendered so strong, that it was thought 
unadvisable to attempt to force them. The evacuation of 
Boston followed as a matter of necessity. 

In the expectation that the flower of the British troops 
would be employed against the Heights of Dorchester, 
General Washington had concerted a plan for availing 
himself of that occasion to attack the town of Boston lit- 
tle doubting that he should be able, with so favorable a 
disposition of his forces, to obtain complete possession of 
the enemy's quarters, if not to achieve an absolute con- 
quest of their army. Four thousand chosen men were 
held in readiness to embark, at the mouth of Charles River 
in Cambridge, on a signal to be given, if the enemy should 
come out in such force, as'to justify an opinion that an 
attack on them might be^ made with a good prospect of 
success. They were to embark in two divisions ; the 
first to be led by Brigadier-General Sullivan, the second 
Ly Brigadier-General Greene ; and the whole to be under 



CONTEMPLATED ATTACK ON BOSTON. 205 

the command of Major-General Putnam. The boats were 
to be preceded by three floating batteries, which were to 
keep up a heavy fire on that part of the town where the 
troops were to land. It was proposed that the first divi- 
sion should land at the powder-house, and gain possession 
of Beacon Hill ; the second at Barton's Point, or a little 
south of it, and after securing that post, to join the other 
division, and force the enemy's works at the Neck, so as 
to give admission to the troops from Roxbury. 

If this plan had succeeded, the whole British army in 
Boston must have been destroyed, or taken prisoners. 
General Washington entertained the most sanguine hopes 
of its success, and greatly regretted the storm, which pre- 
vented the intended attack on the Heights of Dorchester, 
and, consequently, the residue of his plan, the execution 
of which was entirely dependent on that attack. 

At the council of war, in which this plan of an assault 
upon the enemy was under discussion, General Putnam, 
who was always restless, and more disposed to action than 
to deliberation, was continually going to the door and the 
windows, to see what was passing without. At length, 
General Washington said 'to him, with some earnestness, 
" Sit down, General Putnam, we must have your advice 
and counsel in this matter, where the responsibility of its 
execution is devolved upon you." " Oh, my dear Gene- 
ral," he replied, "you may plan the battle to suit yourself, 
and I will fight it." 

On the morning of the 17th of March, the British dis- 
covered a new breast-work, that had been thrown up 
during the night on Nook's Hill, which perfectly com- 
manded the Neck, and all the south part of Boston, and 
rendered their position there wholly untenable. There 
was no longer safety in delay. By sunrise in the morning, 
the king's troops, with those of the Americans who were 



206 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

attached to the royal cause, began to embark ; and before 
ten, they were all under sail, leaving behind them, in the 
haste of their forced departure, a considerable quantity of 
valuable stores. 

As soon as it was reported in Cambridge that the enemy 
were making preparations to evacuate Boston, several 
regiments, under the command of General Putnam, were 
embarked in boats, and dropped down the river, to watch 
and take advantage of their movements. On landing at 
the mouth of the river, it was ascertained that the fleet 
had actually sailed ; and a detachment was ordered to 
take possession of the town, which they did by landing 
on its western shore, near Sewall's Point, which formed 
the southern limit of the Mill Pond. Another detachment 
marched in, at the same time, over the Neck from Rox- 
bury. The whole was under the command of General 
Putnam ; who, amid the cheering welcomes and hearty 
congratulations of the citizens, proceeded to take formal 
possession, in the name of the Continental Congress, of all 
the fortified posts, as well as of the military stores, and 
other property, which had been abandoned by the retreat- 
ing foe. 

One historian of the day relates, that when the British 
retreated from Bunker's Hill, they left sentries standing in 
effigy, with muskets shouldered, and having the usual 
appearance of being on duty. If this were so, it was a 
harmless joke, and gave no alarm to the Americans ; who 
deigned not to waste their powder upon wooden images, 
though clothed in the king's livery. Two men only were 
sent from thf* camp to reconnoitre the post, who entered 
unchallenged, and made signals for their friends to follow 
and take full possession.

MAJOR-GENERAL LEE, during the brief period of his com 
mand at New York, had planned and laid out some works 
of defence, which, in his hasty departure for South Caro- 
lina, were left to be prosecuted by his successor. Believ- 
ing that this place would be the next point at which the 
enemy would aim, and deeming its preservation to be of 
the last importance to the American cause, General Wash- 
ington, immediately after his triumphal entry into Boston, 
sent thither a portion of his troops, assigning the command 
to Major-General Putnam with instructions to carry for- 
ward as rapidly as possible the plan of defence, which had 
been projected by General Lee. 

The following " Orders and Instructions " were issued 
on this occasion.

Wednesday evening, are bound to New York, to endeavor 
to possess that important post, and if possible to secure 
the communication by the Hudson River to Canada, it 
must be our care to prevent them from accomplishing 
their designs. To that end I have detached Brigadier- 
General Heath, with the whole body of riflemen, and five 
battalions of the Continental army, by the way of Nor- 
wich in Connecticut, to New York. Six more battalions, 
under General Sullivan, march this morning by the same 
route, and will, I hope, arrive there in eight or ten days 
at farthest. The rest of the army will immediately follow 
in divisions, leaving only a convenient space between each 
division to prevent confusion, and want of accommodation 
on their march. You will, no doubt, make the best des- 
patch in getting to New York. Upon your arrival there, 
you will assume the command, and immediately proceed 
in continuing to execute the plan proposed by Major- 
General Lee, for fortifying that city, and securing the 
passes of the East and North Rivers. If, upon consulta- 
tion with the Brigadiers-General and Engineers, any alter- 
ation in that plan is thought necessary, you are at liberty 
to make it ; cautiously avoiding to break in too much 
upon bis main design, unless where it may be apparently 
necessary so to do, and that by the general voice and opi- 
nion of the gentlemen above-mentioned. 

" You will meet the Quarter-Master General, Colonel 
Mifflin, and Commissary-General,* at New York. As 
these are both men of excellent talents in their different 
departments, you will do well to give them all the author- 
ity and assistance they require ; and should a council of 
war be necessary, it is my direction they assist at it. 

" Your long service and experience will, better than my 
particular directions at this distance, point out to you the

works most proper to be fast raised; and your perseverance, 
activity and zeal will lead you, without my recommending it t 
to exert every nerve to disappoint the enemy's designs. 

" Devoutly praying that the POWER which has hitherto 
sustained the American arms, may continue to bless them 
with the divine protection, I bid you FAREWELL. 

" Given at Head-Quarters, in Cambridge, this twenty- 
ninth of March, 1776. 

"G. WASHINGTON." 

Entrusted with these responsibilities, General Putnam 
hastened to New York, where he was, for some time, the 
chief in command, in the absence of Washington, and the 
executive commander, during the entire occupancy of the 
city. His head-quarters were at the house, now occupied 
by Mr. Prime, No. 1 Broadway, facing the Bowling 
Green. Here he established himself, with his family about 
him, receiving and entertaining his friends, both in the 
army and in the city, with great hospitality, when the 
arduous duties of his station allowed him time for such 
indulgence. During a part of this time, Major Burr 
served him as aide-de-camp, and resided in his family. 
His son, Major Putnam, and Major David Humphreys, 
who afterwards became his biographer, were also attached 
to his staff. 

As has been already observed, there was some diversity 
of opinion among the Americans, in respect to the contest 
which was now going on. Some opposed the war through 
fear of the consequences, believing it impossible, for a few 
weak, half-united colonies, to resist the omnipotence of 
Great Britain. Many were loyally devoted to the king 
and the mother-country, and felt a kind of holy horror at 
the thought of open resistance to authority. There were 
persons of this description in all the colonies. There had 
M 



210 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

been some in New England. A considerable number bad 
abandoned their homes in Boston, and followed the British 
army in its retreat. But they were much more numerous 
in and about New York, on Long Island, Staten Island, 
and in New Jersey. This made the position of the Ame- 
rican army, and the duty of its commanders, much more 
difficult than it would otherwise have been. They could 
not rely upon the support of all those, for whose liberties 
they were contending. Some of them were secret ene- 
mies, and spies in the service of the British ; and not a 
few were associated in a scheme to get possession of the 
person of the commander-in-chief, and deliver him up to 
the enemy. General Putnam, and other principal officers, 
were at different times the objects of similar plots. This 
will account for the frequent orders respecting the seizure 
of disaffected persons, disarming the suspicious, &c., which 
occur in the correspondence of Washington ; and the fre- 
quent allusions to other perplexities, than those which 
were occasioned by the direct action of the British gene- 
rals, and their forces. 

The city being, of necessity, under martial law, General 
Putnam's first object, on assuming the command, was to 
regulate its police, and put in operation such precautionary 
measures, as would prevent disturbance or surprise in the 
night, and enable him to keep a stricter watch upon the 
movements of spies, and disaffected citizens. For this 
end, after posting the necessary guards, he issued the fol- 
lowing 

" GENERAL ORDERS. 

" Head Quarters, New York, April 5, 1776. 
" The soldiers are strictly enjoined to retire to their 
barracks and quarters at tattoo beating, and to remain 
there till the reveille is beaten. 



POLICE OF THE CITT. 211 

" Necessity obliges the General to desire the inhabit- 
ants of the city to observe the same rule, as no person 
will be permitted to pass any sentry, after this night, with- 
out the countersign. The inhabitants, whose business 
requires it, may know the countersign, by applying to any 
of the Brigade Majors." 

Although the war had raged, in some other parts of the 
country, with a severity that cut off all voluntary inter- 
course between the British and Americans, there had, as 
yet, been no outbreaking of hostilities at New York, beyond 
the firing of a few guns from one armed vessel upon the 
city ; which, however, was attended with no material 
damage. Consequently, the intercourse between the Bri- 
tish vessels and the shore was not wholly interrupted. 
Through the favor of the loyalists, or the connivance of 
those whose avarice was stronger than their patriotism, 
the commanders had hitherto found means to secure ample 
supplies of fresh water and provisions. General Putnam 
resolved to put an effectual stop to all such commerce at 
once, and, accordingly, issued a prohibition in the follow- 
ing very pointed terms. 

" PROHIBITION. 

"'Head Quarters, New York, April 8, 1776. 
" The General informs the inhabitants, that it i-s become 
absolutely necessary that all communication between the 
ministerial fleet and the shore should be immediately stop- 
ped ; for that purpose he has given positive orders that 
the ships should no longer be furnished with provisions. 
Any inhabitants, or others, who shall be taken, that have 
been on board (after the publishing this order), or near 
any of the ships, or going on board, will be considered as 
enemies, and treated accordingly

" All boats are to sail from Beekman slip. Captain

" ISRAEL PUTNAM, 

" Major-General in the Continental Army, and Com- 
mander-in-chief of the Forces in New York." 

In the expectation of the arrival of the British fleet, and 
with a view to protect the harbor and city, and prevent 
the passage of vessels up the North River, a detachment 
of one thousand continentals was sent to occupy Gover- 
nor's Island, and put it in a state of defence. A regiment 
was also detached to fortify Red Hook, so as to command 
the entrance by Buttermilk Channel. Several companies 
were advantageously posted on the Jersey shore, and for- 
tifications were commenced, and carried forward with 
great activity, at every available point. The most active 
measures were taken to break up all attempts, on the part 
of the enemy, to hold any kind of intercourse with the 
shore. The Americans had nothing that could be called 
a navy, at this time, nor any vessels capable of maintaining 
a conflict with the British armed cruisers. They could, 
therefore, with perfect impunity, remain on the coast, and 
hover about the harbors, as they pleased^ Two of them, 
lying at the Narrows, sent their boats to the watering- 
place on Staten Island to procure a fresh supply. By the 
vigilance and activity of General Putnam, one was driven 
off with the loss of two or three men, and the other, with 
her crew, amounting to thirteen, was captured. Soon 
after this, finding that no good purpose could be accom- 
plished by remaining at a post that was so vigilantly 
guarded at all points, and not being sufficiently strong to 
attempt offensive operations, the ships withdrew from the

harbor, and put to sea, awaiting the arrival of the fleet, 
with reinforcements for the army, then in repose at Hali- 
fax. 

Besides the correspondence which he maintained with 
the Commander-in-chief at this time, General Putnam held 
free communication, by letter and personally, with the 
New York Committee of Safety, on all the questions of 
public interest requiring their attention. At one time, we 
find him calling urgently for the levies, which were need- 
ed for the construction and defence of his works (Am. 
Arch., vol. vi., page 1164), and at another making pro- 
vision for guarding the City Records, and other public 
property (page 1432). Nothing that could in any way 
subserve the public good, was too minute for his vigilance , 
nothing too difficult for his industry and zeal. 

In his correspondence with Congress, he shows the 
enlarged views he entertained of the measures to be adopt- 
ed, and the boldness and confidence with which he enter- 
ed upon the execution of his important trust ; while the 
replies of the President of that body indicate an entire 
reliance on the patriotism, skill, judgment, and integrity 
of the General. Large sums of money are demanded on 
the one part, and remitted on the other, with the same 
tone of lofty courtesy, and mutual esteem and confidence, 
that characterized the correspondence with the Com- 
mander-in-chief. The following extract from the first 
letter to Congress, written the third day after his arrival 
at New York, furnishes some of the details of the capture 
of the boat's crew on Staten Island. 

" Head Quarters, New York, April 7, 1776. 

" SIR : 

" I arrived here on Wednesday evening last, having his 
Excellency General Washington's orders to take com- 






214 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

mand of the forces in this city, and to erect such works as 
I should think necessary for its defence ; in which we are 
busily employed. 

" After getting the works in such forwardness, as will 
be prudent to leave, I propose immediately to take pos- 
session of Governor's Island, which I think a very impor- 
tant post. Should the enemy arrive here, and get post 
there, it will not be possible to save the city, nor can we 
dislodge them without great loss. 

" On Friday, arrived at the Narrows a small ship of 
eighteen or twenty guns* sent her boat immediately on 
board the Duchess of Gordon ; soon after which the Go- 
vernor in the ' Duchess ' sailed where bound we know 
not. 

" This morning the ship sent a boat to the watering 
place for water. The day before, I had detached three 
companies of the Rifle Battalion to Staten Island, with 
orders to scour the shores. A midshipman and twelve 
sailors were in the boat. She was fired upon, and lost 
two men. The Riflemen took the rest prisoners, and 
hauled up the boat. The ship immediately began a 
heavy fire, and slightly wounded one man. She has since 
fallen down below the Narrows.

attack upon her boat, and the taking of the prisoners, may be found

arrests of persons, concerned in sending provisions, or giving infor- 
mation, to the enemy. Am. Archives, vol. iv., j,agc 820. 



ARRIVAL OF GEN. WASHINGTON. 215 

were vigorously pursued for strengthening his position 
there, and endeavoring to render the passes of the Hudson 
and the East River inaccessible to the enemy's ships. 
Other measures, were also concerted, for the same end, 
and put in execution with the utmost spirit and despatch. 
Hulks were sunk in the channel, to obstruct the navigation 
of the river. The most advantageous positions, not already 
occupied, on both sides of the North River, and of the 
narrow passages between the islands, were taken and for- 
tified, as far as the limited means at the command of 
Washington rendered possible. Of all these works, Gene- 
ral Putnam had still the chief superintendence and direc- 
tion. The defences were well placed, and constructed 
with a skill and science that was highly honorable to the 
officers and engineers who planned and superintended 
them. But they were too feebly mounted, and too scan- 
tily supplied with munitions of war, as the sequel proved, 
to answer the principal purpose for which they were 
designed. In all the early operations of the continental 
army, the want of heavy cannon was most sensibly felt. 

The Commander-in-chief, having inspected the works 
in progress, and carefully examined the condition and dis- 
cipline of the army, availed himself of the first public 
orders, issued in his own name, to compliment the officers 
who had successively commanded New York, for their 
capacity and diligence ; and to return his thanks to them, 
as well as to the officers and soldiers under their com- 
mand, for the many works of defence which had been so 
expeditiously erected, and for others so well and courage- 
ously begun. At the same time, he expressed his confi- 
dence, that the same zeal and spirit would continue to 
animate them in their future conduct. 

On the 21st of May, at the urgent request of Congress, 
General Washington proceeded to Philadelphia, to confer 



216 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

with that body remaining absent until the seventh of 
June. During this interval, General Putnam was again 
invested with the supreme command at New York, with 
directions to open all letters addressed to General Wash- 
ington on public business, and regulate his conduct by 
their contents ; to carry on with spirit the works of de- 
fence ; to establish signals for communicating an alarm, on 
the appearance of the enemy ; and to make arrangements 
to put the posts in the Highlands into a proper condition 
of defence. The following letter, taken in connection 
with the statements given above, of the arduous duties 
required of him, will serve to show that the life of a vigi- 
lant officer, in active service, is not a life of idleness 

" To MAJOR-GENERAL PUTNAM. 
" Instructions, 

" SIR : I have reason to believe, that the Provincial 
Congress of this colony, have in contemplation a scheme 
for seizing the principal tories, and disaffected persons uu 
Long Island, in this city, and the country round about ; 
and that, to carry the scheme into operation, they will 
have recourse to the military power for assistance. If 
this should be the case, you are hereby required, during 
my absence, to afford every aid, which the said Congress, 
or their committee, shall apply for. I need not recom- 
mend secresy to you, as the success, you must be assured, 
will depend absolutely upon precaution, and the despatch 
with which the measure, when once adopted, shall be 
executed. 

" General Greene will, though not in person perhaps, 
have a principal share in ordering the detachments from 
his brigade on Long Island ; of course he will be a proper 
person to be let into the whole plan. I would, therefore, 
when application is made by Congress, have you and him 



TREATMENT OF THE DISAFFECTED. 217 

concert measures with such gentlemen as that body shall 
please to appoint, and order the execution with as much 
secresy and despatch as possible, and at the same time, 
with the utmost decency and good order. 

" Given under my hand, at Head-Quarters, in the city 
of New York, this 21st day of May, 1776." 

The machinations of disaffected persons, or Tories, as 
they began to be universally called, in the lower counties 
of New York, had, for some time, excited serious appre- 
hensions as to their effect on the army, and particularly 
when the British fleet should arrive on the coast. Gover- 
nor Tryon was at their head. His influence in the colonj T 
was great, and justly feared. The Mayor of the city was 
deeply involved, being the principal agent of communica- 
tion between Tryon and the main body of Tories. The 
disaffection had even been communicated to the army, and 
a part of Washington's Guard had engaged in it. The 
Provincial Congress, in the measures which were concert- 
ed between their committee and General Washington, laid 
themselves under an oath of secresy. It was then report- 
ed to them that a scheme of junction was forming, between 
the Tories in Connecticut and those on Long Island, in 
order to join the ministerial army, and oppress the friends 
of liberty in the colonies. The result of their action, 
under the spirited co-operation of the Commander, was, 
that a considerable number of disaffected persons were 
seized, and put in confinement ; and one, named Thomas 
Hicks, a member of Washington's Guard, who had enlist- 
ed himself, and induced others to do the same, was tried 
by a court-martial, and executed, on the 28th of June, for 
mutiny, sedition, and treachery. 

The following letter from General Washington, dated 
Philadelphia, June 3, 1776, will serve to introduce ano-

218 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

ther department of duty, to which General Putnam's atten- 
tion was urgently directed, and to which he devoted a 
great deal of thought and care. 

" DEAR SIR : I received your favor by yesterday even- 
ing's express, with the several letters and intelligence from 
General Schuyler, and am much concerned for the further 
misfortunes that have attended our arms in Canada. I 
have laid the whole before Congress, who had before 
resolved to send a considerable augmentation to our army 
there ; and I doubt not that General Schuyler may receive 
assistance from the militia most convenient to him, for 
securing the different passes and communications, till they 
can be relieved. As to sending a reinforcement from New 
York, neither policy nor prudence will justify it, as we 
have the strongest reasons to believe the day not far dis- 
tant, when a large armament will arrive, and vigorously 
attempt an impression there ; to oppose which, the forces 
we have, will not be more than equal, if sufficient. 

" Congress have determined on sundry gondolas, and fire- 
rafts, to prevent the men-of-war, and enemy's ships, from 
coming into New York or the Narrows. I must, there- 
fore, request, that you will make inquiries after carpenters, 
and procure all you can, with materials necessary for 
building them, that tney may go on with all possible ex- 
pedition, as soon as the person arrives from hence, whom I 
have employed to superintend the work. He will be there 
in a day or two. 

" I am, dear Sir, &c., 

"GEO. WASHINGTON." 

On evacuating Boston, General Howe had retired to 
Halifax. His purpose seems to have I een to wait there 
for the large reinforcements expected from England, and 



AT NEW YORK . 219 

not to approach his adversary, till he possessed a force 
sufficiently large to act on the offensive, and with such 
success as would make a very serious impression. The 
situation of his army was very uncomfortable, however, 
and the delay of the arrival of the troops from England so 
great, that he determined to proceed at once to New 
York, with such forces as were under his command 
knowing that he could take a station of perfect security 
in one of the islands on its seaboard, and there wait, until 
he should be strong enough to commence his intended 
plan of operations. 

In the latter part of June, he arrived off Sandy Hook, 
in the Greyhound, and on the twenty-ninth of the same 
month, the first division of the fleet from Halifax reached 
the same place. The rear division arrived soon after, and 
landed the troops on Staten Island, where there was no 
military force, with the exception of a small number of 
men sent to drive off such cattle as might supply the 
enemy with fresh provisions. 

The people of this island, as well as those of Long 
Island, and the neighboring parts of New Jersey, express- 
ed a favorable disposition towards the royal cause. Gene- 
ral Howe, therefore, chose Staten Island as his station, 
until the arrival of the expected troops. General Wash- 
ington, foreseeing the distress which would be occasioned 
by cutting off the supply of fresh provisions, had urged 
the removal of the stock and grain in the small islands 
near the coast ; but this, owing to the large extent of the 
coast, and the necessity of keeping every effective hand at 
work upon the fortifications, had been only partially 
attended to, and Howe was in a measure supplied with 
what he wanted. 

The opposition which the British troops had encoun- 
tered in New England, had given rather a serious coin- 



220 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

plexion to the war, and proved to the British Ministry 
the necessity of employing a much larger force, than had 
at first heen thought sufficient, for the suppression of the 
rebellion. In addition, therefore, to the national troops, 
they employed about thirteen thousand Hessians and Wai- 
deckers. 

As had been foreseen by General Washington, the great 
effort was now to be made on the Hudson. A variety of 
considerations suggested the policy of transferring the 
seat of war to thjs part of the continent. The country 
on the sea-board being divided into islands, is assailable in 
every direction by a maritime force, and, accordingly, 
requires for defence against a conjoint attack by land and 
water, not only complete fortifications, but also a very 
large and powerful army. The very same causes, which 
render this part of the United States so vulnerable to an 
invading enemy commanding the sea, secure that enemy 
in the possession of it, after it has been acquired. A naval 
superiority will, consequently, be nearly always necessary, 
to drive even an inferior enemy from this post. 

From this position, he could either carry the war east- 
wardly into New England, northwardly into the State of 
New York, or westwardly into the Jerseys and Pennsyl- 
vania ; or, if too weak to do either, he could retire into a 
place of security, and harass the enemy in his neighbor- 
hood, or carry on expeditions against distant parts of the 
continent. In fact, it left him at entire liberty to choose 
the scene of action, and the kind of operations by which 
to annoy his enemy. If he should get possession of the 
Hudson, he would also be enabled to open a direct com- 
munication with Canada, and have it in his power to inter- 
rupt the intercourse between the eastern and southern 
states In addition to all this, he would cover his friends, 



DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. 221 

who in turn would supply him with all those necessaries 
he had so much wanted in his old station. 

The command of the fleet was given to Lord Howe, 
brother of General Howe ; and they were both constitut- 
ed commissioners for restoring peace to the colonies and 
granting pardons. Lord Howe arrived at Halifax a short 
time after his brother's departure, and reached Staten 
Island about the 12th of July. 

In the meantime, the great decisive measure, which 
fixed the character of this conflict, and elevated a rebellion 
into a Revolution, had been adopted, and made public, by 
the Congress of the United States. The Declaration of 
Independence, the Magna Charta of American liberty, had 
received the signatures of the immortal fifty-six. It was 
immediately transmitted, by President Hancock, to the 
Commander-in-chief, with a request to have it suitably 
proclaimed at the head of the army. The following order 
was accordingly issued : 

" The Continental Congress, impelled by the dictates of 
duty, policy, and necessity, have been pleased to dissolve 
the connection which subsisted between this country and 
Great Britain, and to declare the United Colonies of North 
America Free and Independent States. The several bri- 
gades are to be drawn up this evening on their respective 
parades, at six o'clock, when the Declaration of Congress, 
showing the grounds and reasons of this measure, is to be 
read with an audible voice. The General hopes, that this 
important event will serve as a fresh incentive to every 
officer and soldier, to act with fidelity and courage, as 
knowing that now the peace and safety of his country 
depend, under God, solely on the success of our arms ; 
and that he is now in the service of a state possessed of 
sufficient power to reward his merit, and advance him to 
the highest honors of a free country." 



222 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

This Declaration was received by the army with the 
highest satisfaction and enthusiasm ; the expressions and 
behavior, both of officers and men, testifying their warm- 
est approbation of the measure, and their determination to 
ustain and defend it, to the last drop of their blood.

THE arrival of Admiral Howe with his fleet at New York, 
and the return of General Clinton from the south, which 
took place about the same time, placed at the command 
of General Howe, an army of twenty-four thousand men, 
composed of the best troops of Europe, and officered by 
men of tried courage and experience. A further rein- 
forcement of eleven thousand was instantly' expected, 
which would swell their numbers to thirty-five thousand. 
It was the design of the British to seize New York, with 
a force sufficient to keep possession of the Hudson River 
open a communication with Canada separate the East- 
ern States, whe*e the rebellion began, from the Middle 
and Southern, where there was still a strong leaven of 
loyalty to work upon and overrun the adjacent country 
at pleasure. 

To oppose this large, highly disciplined, and well-ap- 
pointed force, the Americans had, in this vicinity, an army 
of seventeen thousand troops, of whom little over ten 
thousand were deemed effective, and fit for duty poorly 



224 LIFE r GENERAL PUTNAM. 

provided with arms without treasure, and almost without 
ammunition. Ten thousand more were expected, who 
reached the camp about the first of August. The result, 
defying all human calculations, is one of those remarkable 
events, in which the working of an Almighty providence 
is manifest to every eye, causing justice and truth to pre- 
vail, in the unequal contest with power. 

Immediately on the arrival of the British fleet, an 
attempt was made to force the passage of the North 
River, and try the force of the American batteries. Avail- 
ing themselves of the combined aid of the flood tide, and 
a brisk south wind, the Phoenix of forty guns, and the 
Rose of twenty, accompanied by three tenders, ran boldly 
up, and passed the batteries, without sustaining any mate- 
rial damage from the heavy and incessant cannonade, which 
saluted them from both sides as they passed. Their decks 
were guarded with ramparts of sand-bags, which served to 
protect the men from the small shot, and their motion was 
so rapid, that they remained but a short time within the 
range of the heavy guns. They ascended to the broad 
part of the river, called Tappan Sea, about forty miles 
from New York, where they could cast anchor so far from 
the shore on either side, as to be out of danger from the 
American guns. Their object was, to obstruct the sup- 
plies which came down the river to New York, and to 
cut off the communication between Washington and the 
army on the Lakes. They frequently attempted to land 
with their boats, but were driven back by the militia of 
the neighborhood, on both sides of the river ; who watch- 
ed their motions so narrowly, that for several weeks they 
were unable to hold any direct intercourse with the fleet, 
though, by means of their Tory friends on shore, they had 
contrived to make known to the Admiral their safe arrival 
at their point of destination. It was probably a part of 



PLANS TO ANNOY THE ENEMY. 225 

their design to supply the Tories with arms, and otherwise 
encourage and assist them in their disaffection. But in 
this they were completely foiled, by the vigilance and 
activity of the New York patriots, who, with General 
George Clinton at their head, guarded every point with 
so watchful an eye, that they could make no signal for 
the shore that was not intercepted. 

Several methods were adopted to drive the enemy from 
this position, and to annoy and weaken his naval force, as 
well as to prevent further advances of the same kind. A 
considerable number of galleys, hastily provided in New 
York, and placed under the command of Colonel Tupper, 
came to an engagement with the Phoenix and the Rose, in 
the North River. General Washington, referring to it, in 
his despatch to Congress, under date of the 5th of August, 
says : " What injury was done to the ships, I cannot 
ascertain. All accounts agree, that our officers and men, 
during the whole affair, behaved with great spirit and 
bravery. The damage done to the galleys, shows, beyond 
question, that they had a warm time of it. The ships still 
remain up the river, and, before anything further can be 
attempted against them, the galleys must be repaired." 

He then refers to another plan which was in pro- 
gress of execution, to prevent the other ships from pro- 
ceeding up the river. " The hulks, and three chevaux- 
de-frise, that have been preparing to obstruct the channel, 
have got up to the place they are intended for, and will be 
sunk as soon as possible." The mode of constructing the 
chevaux-de-frise, was a contrivance of General Putnam's. 
It is thus described, in a letter from him to General Gates, 
dated July 26th. 

" The enemy's fleet now lies in the bay very safe, close 
under Staten Island. Their troops possess no land here 
but the island. Is it not strange, that those invincible 
O 



226 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

troops, who were to destroy and lay waste all this country 
with their fleets and army, are so fond of islands and pen- 
insulas, and dare not put their feet on the main ? But I 
hope, by the blessing of God and good friends, we shall 
pay them a visit on their island. For that end, we are 
preparing fourteen fire-ships to go into their fleet, some of 
which are ready charged and fitted to sail, and I hope soon 
to have them all fixed. We are preparing chevaux-de- 
frise, at which we make great despatch by the help of 
ships, which are to be sunk a scheme of mine, which, 
you may be assured, is very simple ; a plan of which I 
send you. The two ships' sterns lie towards each other, 
about seventy feet apart. Three large logs, which reach 
from ship to ship, are fastened to them. The two ships 
and logs stop the river two hundred and eighty feet. The 
ships are to be sunk, and, when hauled down on one side, 
the pricks will be raised to a proper height, and they 
must inevitably stop the river, if the enemy will let us 
sink them." 

This chevaux-de-frise was sunk just above the entrance 
of the Palisades, stretching from JefFery's Hook, at Fort 
Washington, to the northernmost redoubt at Fort Lee. 
But, though much relied on, it proved insufficient for the 
purpose for which it was designed. The rapid current, 
changing with every turn of the tide, and continually 
wrenching the work, so weakened it, that it gave way 
before the weight and momentum of the heavy armed 
ships, and left them a free course as before. 

The fire-ships, before referred to, were scarcely more 
successful. Two of them were sent up, on the 16th of 
August, to operate against the Phoenix and Rose, in Tap- 
pan Sea. One of them boarded the Phoenix, and was 
grappled with her for some minutes, but she succeeded in 
clearing herself. The only damage the enemy sustained, 



BUSHNELL'S AMERICAN TURTLE. 227 

was the destruction of one of the tenders. The men en- 
gaged in this affair, behaved with great resolution and intre- 
pidity. Though the enterprise did not succeed according 
to the wishes of those who directed it, it so alarmed the 
enemy, as to compel him to abandon his position. The 
second day after this attempt, both ships, with their re- 
maining tenders, took advantage of a favorable gale and 
tide, to run down the river, and rejoin the fleet at the Nar- 
rows. They were handsomely saluted by the batteries, as 
they passed, and not without effect, though they did not 
suffer any material loss or damage. 

Among the Connecticut troops, was an officer, named 
Bushnell ; a man of education, of some what eccentric habits, 
but of a strong mechanical turn of mind. While at col- 
lege, he had prepared a model of a submarine explosive 
machine, or torpedo, of a very ingenious construction. He 
gave it the name of " The American Turtle." The report 
of this contrivance coming to the ears of General Putnam, 
he sent Major Burr, his aide-de-camp, to invite Bushnell 
to come and see him. After a little conversation, the 
model was sent for, examined, explained, and highly ap- 
proved ; and Bushnell was immediately furnished with 
the necessary funds to construct a full machine, and put it 
in operation. 

In the course of ten days it was completed. Outwardly 
it bore some resemblance to a large sea-turtle. Hence, 
the origin of its name. In the head there was an opening, 
sufficiently large to admit a man. This apartment was 
air-tight, and was designed to be supplied with air suffi- 
cient to support life for half an hour. At the bottom, op- 
posite this entrance, was a deposit of lead for ballast. 
The operator sat upright, holding an oar for rowing for- 
ward or backward, and having command of a rudder to 
direct his course in any direction. An aperture at the 



228 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

bottom, with its valve, admitted water, for the purpose of 
descending, while two brass forcing-pumps served to eject 
the water, when necessary to rise to the surface. 

Behind this vessel, and above the rudder, was a place 
for carrying a large powder-magazine. This was made 
of two pieces of oak timber, large enough when hollowed 
out, to contain one hundred and fifty pounds of powder, 
with the apparatus used for firing it ; and was secured in 
any place, where it was designed to act, by means of a 
screw turned by the operator. Within the magazine, was 
a piece of clock-work, capable of running twelve hours, 
and so arranged as to be set to any moment, at the will of 
the manager. When it had run out its time, it unpinioned 
a strong lock, resembling a gun-lock, by means of which 
the explosion was produced. 

Unfortunately for the contriver and his patron, this well- 
managed scheme failed, not, it appears, for any want of 
skill in the construction of the machine, but for another 
reason, which will appear in the sequel. 

A brother of Captain Bushnell was appointed to go 
down with the machine, but falling sick the day before the 
experiment was to have been made, it was necessary to 
find a substitute. A sergeant in the regiment from New 
London, volunteered for this service. His name was Abi- 
jah Shipman, better known among his comrades as "Long 
Bige." He was an amphibious kind of a fellow had 
been in early life a sailor, engaged in carrying " stock " 
to the West Indies ; and was a genuine specimen of what 
would be called a " queer fish," or " a live Yankee." He 
stood six feet two or three inches, was remarkably lean 
and bony, and full of dry wit and humor. Fear formed 
no part of his composition, his chief faults were rather 
too strong a liking for St. Croix and tobacco. 

Before daylight, on a morning in July, Abijah was put 



ABIJAI1 SHIP MAN'S ADVENTURE. 229 

on board the torpedo on the North River side, preparatory 
to being pulled off into the stream, from whence he was 
to drop down with the tide, and get under the bottom of 
the Eagle, which was the flag-ship of Admiral Howe. 
Putnam, Bushnell, Heath, Knowlton, Burr, and many 
other officers, accompanied him to the shore. The under- 
taking was regarded as extremely hazardous, and no little 
skill and coolness were required for the successful manage- 
ment of the machine. If he could once strike the ship, 
and attach the magazine to any portion of the bottom, her 
destruction was inevitable. But to do this, great care and 
judgment were needed, and there were many circum- 
stances that might interfere with its successful operation. 

Every thing being ready, Abijah went on board the Tur- 
tle, and was about to screw himself into the air-tight 
chamber, when, suddenly thrusting his head out again, he 
exclaimed 

" Thunder and marlinspikes ! who's got a cud of to- 
bacco ? This old cud won't last, any how !" at the same 
time pulling out an ounce or more of the weed, and throw- 
ing it away. 

The officers, not being addicted to this peculiar indul- 
gence, or having left their boxes at home, the sergeant's 
odd appeal excited only a laugh. Not even a bit of pig- 
tail could be found, and Abijah was absolutely obliged to do 
without it for daylight was near at hand, and it was ne- 
cessary he should move, without a moment's delay. 

" Ah ! my brave boy !" said Putnam, " you see how it 
is we continental officers are too poor to raise even a 
tobacco plug. Push off, my fine fellow, and to-morrowj 
when yonder Eagle has taken his last flight, some of the 
southern officers shall give you an order for a keg of old 
Virginia." 

"Too bad !" answered Abijah, despondingly ; " but 



230 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

mind, Gen'ral, if the old Turtle doesn't do her duty, it's 
all because I go to sea without tobacco." 

The machine was towed into the stream, and cast off, and 
Abijah, in his narrow chamber in the Turtle's head, disap- 
peared under water. For the space of an hour or more, 
Putnam and his friends waited upon the Battery, expect- 
ing every moment to see the Eagle ascend into the air. 
When the morning broke, suspense gave way to fear. 
Nothing was to be seen of the torpedo, and the officers 
began to mourn for Abijah, as one to be reported among the 
" Tnissing," at the next call of his regimental muster- 
roll. 

Putnam had been intently examining the vicinity of the 
Eagle with his glass, when he suddenly exclaimed, " There 
he is." The top of the machine was just emerging from 
the water, in a little bay, to the left of the Eagle. It did 
not escape the observation of the watchful sentinels on 
board the ship. A volley of musketry was fired into it, 
and down popped the Turtle in a twinkling, Abijah not 
relishing this kind of salutation. Boats were immediately 
sent from the shore to his assistance, and the Eagle was 
observed to be getting under weigh in great haste. The 
sergeant was taken up near Governor's Island. The ma- 
gazine had been cast off, and being set to run an hour, 
exploded, at the expiration of that time, with tremendous 
force, throwing up the water in every direction. The 
alarm on board the men-of-war was very great. There 
was an instant heaving at ihe anchors of the Eagle, 
the Asia, the Chatham, and all the rest. The har- 
bor was evacuated without the ceremony of a salute ; 
and, from that time, till the mornino- of the battle of Long 

' ' o O 

Island, not an English vessel moved from Staten Island up 
the bay. 



NECESSITY THE MOTHER OF INVENTION. 231 

On landing, the eccentric sergeant gave the following 
account of his perilous submarine expedition 

"Just as I said, Gen'ral ! it all failed for want of that 
cud of tobacco. You see I am narvous without tobacco. 
I got under the Eagle's bottom, but somehow the screw 
struck the iron bar, that passes from the rudder pintle, and 
wouldn't hold on, any how I could fix it. Just then I let 
go the oar to feel for a cud, to steady my narves, and I 
hadn't any. The tide swept me under her counter, 
and away I slipped top o' water. I couldn't manage to get 
back, so I pulled the lock, and let the thunder-box slide. 
I say, can't you raise a cud among you, now ?"* 

The immense advantage, which the British commander 
possessed over his antagonist, in the well-appointed fleet, 
under the command of his brother, Admiral Howe, con- 
stituted one of the many inequalities in this contest, which 
the Americans found it most difficult to overcome. They 
had neither navy, nor seamen, nor the means of raising 
and equipping them ; while the enemy, being amply pro- 
vided with both, had every facility for moving in any 
direction, transporting forces and provisions from place to 
place, and protecting their movements, and flanking their 
batteries, by the heavy guns of their ships, as well as cut- 
ting off the communication of their adversary with his dif- 
ferent posts. It was, therefore, of the highest importance, 

that some efficient means should be devised, to resist, and, 

7 

if possible, destroy this powerful engine of offence ; or, at 
least to protect from its approaches some of the most vul- 
nerable and important points in the line of their defences. 
The best mode of doing this became a subject of intense 
interest, and deep study, with all those who were actively 

engaged in the good cause. From the Commander-in-

nious mind was bent upon devising schemes of annoyance, 
which should, in some degree, supply the deficiency of a 
naval force. Necessity, as in all similar cases, became 
the mother of invention. A variety of experiments were 
made, and a very considerable expense incurred, in the 
prosecution of these inventions. Putnam, who was apt 
and ingenious in such contrivances, devoted a great deal 
of attention to them, and was encouraged in doing so, by 
the approval of Washington, and of Congress. From this 
source sprung not only torpedos and turtles, but chevaux- 
de-frise, both in the Hudson and Delaware, with booms, 
chains, and sunken hulks, row-galleys, fire-rafts, and other 
devices. It is true, they were not, in many instances, 
successful. They answered but little purpose, in check- 
ing the movements of the enemy, and only in a few cases, 
disabled any of their vessels. The ships passed over the 
chevaux-de-frise without damage. The row-galleys were 
too feeble to compete with their heavy guns. The fire- 
ships failed for want of skill in their management ; and 
the torpedo was lost by an unfortunate sweep of the tide, 
or, if we may credit the story of Abijah Shipman, for lack 
of a quid of tobacco. This torpedo was the most promis- 
ing of all the inventions of the day, and would, if success- 
ful in one instance, have done more than any or all the 
rest, to intimidate the enemy and take away the strength 
from this right arm of his power. Not knowing when or 
where to expect it, he would always have approached the 
shore with fear and trembling, and Putnam and Bushnell 
would have been regarded as the ablest and most favored 
of the defenders of thier country. Whether it was owing 
to want of confidence in the scheme, or the feeble state of 
Bushnell's health, does not appear ; but the experiment 
was never tried again.

A PORTION of the American army was stationed at Brook- 
lyn, on Long Island, under the command of Major-General 
Greene. It was an important position, and its defence 
was deemed absolutely necessary, to secure the possession 
of the city of New York. It was strongly fortified against 
an attack from within the island, by a line of defences, 
extending along the high grounds, from Wallabout to Go- 
wanus Bay, at a distance of about a mile and a half from 
" The Heights." The remains of its northern redoubt, 
called Fort Greene, are still to be seen, between Myrtle 
and Fulton Avenues, above Navy Street. A portion of 
the line of intrenchments from that point towards Red 



234 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM 

Hook, may also be easily traced, on the south side of Ful- 
ton Street, just below its junction with the A. venue. These 
will soon disappear before the rapid advances of a popu- 
lous and thriving city, but Fort Greene is to be preserved, 
in perpetuo, and ornamented as a public park. 

These fortifications commanded, from the various points 
of their extended line, all the approaches from the inte- 
rior, and from the northern and southern shores of the 
Island. The rear was covered and defended against an 
attack from the ships, by strong batteries on Red Hook 
and Governor's Island, which, in a great measure, com- 
manded that part of the bay, and by other batteries on the 
East River, which kept open the communication with the 
main army in the city of New York. In front of these 
defences, was a range of hills covered with thick woods, 
extending eastwardly nearly the whole length of the Island. 
They were everywhere passable by infantry, and were 
traversed, at three different points, by roads leading to the 
1 Brooklyn Ferry. These were the only points, or passes, 
through which artillery or cavalry could approach. 

On the eve of an expected attack from the enemy, 
General Greene was seized with a raging fever, and the 
command of this important post devolved upon General 
Sullivan. On the 22d of August, a large body of the 
British, under the command of General Clinton, landed 
near the Ferry at the Narrows, and marched through 
Utrecht and Gravesend, across the low grounds at Flat- 
bush, approaching within three or four miles of the Ame- 
rican lines. Their principal encampment was near the 
village of Flatland, under Clinton, Earl Percy and Lord 
Cornwallis. The centre, at Flatbush, was composed of 
Hessians, under the command of General De Heister. 
The left wing, under General Grant, extended to the place 
of landing, on the coast. The landing was effected with- 



HE TAKES COMMAND AT BROOKLYN. 235 

out opposition, under cover of the ships that lined the 
coast Colonel Donop's corps of chasseurs and Hessian 
grenadiers, with forty pieces of cannon, being in the van. 
A party of Pennsylvania troops, under Colonel Hand, 
whose duty it was to guard the coast at this place, retired 
before them, and took a position on the high grounds, 
commanding the pass from Flatbush to Brooklyn. Lord 
Cornwallis was detached to seize this pass, if not in the 
hands of the Americans ; but was commanded not to en- 
gage with them, if they were there in any force. Finding 
the pass guarded, he moved on, and took post with the 
British right wing at Flatland. 

Immediately on the landing of this force, Washington 
detached six battalions from the army in New York, to 
reinforce General Sullivan, and ordered five battalions 
more to be in readiness to join them, at a moment's 
warning. 

On Sunday, the 25th, Major General Putnam was 
directed to take command at Brooklyn, carrying with him* 
these additional reinforcements General Sullivan still 
holding the immediate command of all the troops not 
within the lines. In his orders from the Commander-in- 
chief, Putnam was urgently enjoined to put everything in 
readiness for a resolute defence ; and, in particular, to 
guard well the passes between his lines and the enemy's 
camp. " The wood next to Red Hook should be well 
attended to. Put some of the most disorderly riflemen 
into it. The militia are the most indifferent troops, those 
I mean who are least tutored, and have seen the least 
service, and will do for the interior works ; whilst your 
best men should, at all hazards, prevent the enemy's pass- 
ing the woods, and approaching your works. The woods 
should be secured by abattis when necessary, to make the 
enemy's approach as difficult as possible. Traps and 



236 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

ambuscades should be laid for their parties, if you find 
they are sent out after cattle." 

On Tuesday, the 27th, two days after General Putnam 
took the command, the attack was made. Agreeably to 
the leading suggestion in his orders, as well as to the natu- 
ral facilities of the place, he expected the first and prin- 
cipal offensive demonstration to be made, by way of the 
passes near the western shore. To these, therefore, he 
directed his first attention. 

In order to a perfect understanding of the details of the 
battle which ensued, it will be necessary to obtain a clear 
view of the relative position of the two armies, previous 
to the engagement. The range of hills before-mentioned 
lay between them. The British centre, at Flatbush, was 
scarcely four miles distant from the American lines at 
Fort Greene a road leading directly across from one to 
the other. Another road, diverging a little northwardly 
from this, led through another pass, by way of Bedford 
village. The right and left wings of the British army, 
the former near Flatland, the latter near Utrecht and 
Gravesend, at the Narrows, were each between five and 
six miles from the American works. From the position 
occupied by the right wing, there was another and some- 
what circuitous route, through a pass on the north, leading 
into the main road from Jamaica to Bedford. All these 
several roads met in the plain, between Bedford and 
Brooklyn, within less than half a mile from the American 
lines. 

The road first mentioned, leading direct from Flatbush 
to Brooklyn, was defended by a strong redoubt, under the 
immediate command of General Sullivan. To this point 
Colonel Hand had retired with his detachment, on the 
landing of the British, burning, as he passed along, several 
parcels of wheat, and such other valuables as he supposed 



MOVEMENTS OF CLINTON AND GRANT. 237 

would fall into the enemy's hands. The pass on the 
other road from Flatbush, leading to Bedford, was occu- 
pied by Colonel Williams on the north, and a regiment of 
Pennsylvania riflemen, under Colonel Miles, on the south 
The road from Jamaica, on the north side of the hills, 
guarded by light parties of volunteers, was less ably pro- 
tected than either of the others partly because less danger 
was apprehended from that quarter, and partly because 
the change of command, consequent upon the illness of 
General Greene, who superintended the erection of the 
works, and was thoroughly acquainted with the lay of the 
land, left the whole affair to the direction of those, who 
did not fully understand the ground, and who had not suf- 
ficient time, before the action, to acquire a thorough 
knowledge of their position. 

About nine o'clock on the evening of the 26th, General 
Clinton, having ascertained the weakness of the party at 
the pass on the north of his position, silently drew off the 
van of his army in that direction. Arriving at the pass, 
unperceived, before day-break, he surprised and secured 
the whole party stationed there thus cutting off from his 
enemy all knowledge of his approach. On the appearance 
of day, his whole column passed the heights, and advanced 
into the level country, between them and Brooklyn. 

Before Clinton had secured this movement, on which 
the fate of the day turned, General Grant, being ordered 
to make a diversion in the opposite direction, advanced 
along the coast, at the head of the left wing, with ten 
pieces of cannon. His main object being to draw the 
attention of the American commander from his left, now 
exposed, without knowing it, to the whole force of the 
British right, he moved slowly, skirmishing, as he advanc- 
ed, with the light parties stationed along the road. 

This movement of General Grant was communicated to 



238 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

General Putnam about three o'clock in the morning, who 
immediately detached Brigadier-General Lord Stirling, 
with strong reinforcements, to meet and resist it. lie 
reached the summit of the hill a little before sunrise, and 
was there joined by the troops which had been already 
engaged, and were now slowly retiring before the enemy. 
Their retreat being arrested by this timely reinforcement, 
the enemy soon appeared in sight. A brisk cannonade 
was immediately commenced on both sides, which con 
tinued for several hours ; while some spirited, but not 
very effective skirmishing took place between the infantry 
Lord Stirling, being ordered to act only on the defensive, 
Was anxious only to keep possession of the pass. He 
could not, therefore, descend in force from the heights, to 
bring on a general engagement ; and General Grant had 
no desire to drive him back, until that part of the plan, 
which was under the direction of Sir Henry Clinton, 
should be executed. 

Soon after daylight, General De Heister commenced a 
distant cannonade upon the American redoubt above Flat- 
bush, where General Sullivan was stationed. He did not, 
however, advance from his position at Flatbush, until he 
had notice that the British right had turned the left, and 
gained the rear of the American lines. In the meantime, 
the more effectually to divert attention from the actual 
point of attack, the fleet was put in motion, and a heavy 
cannonade commenced upon the battery at Red Hook. 

About half-past eight, the British van having reached 
Bedford, and thrown forward a detachment to the rear of 
General Sullivan, General De Heister ordered Colonel 
Donop's corps to advance upon the redoubt on the hill, 
himself following with the whole of his 'division. At the 
moment that this movement was attempted, General Sul- 
livan was made aware of the presence of the main division 



SULLIVAN DEFEATED AND CAPTURED. 239 

of the British at Bedford, and an effort was immediately 
made to regain the camp at Brooklyn. While retiring 
from the woods, by regiments, with this view, they en- 
countered the British front. At the same instant, De 
Heister came up from Flatbush, to attack them on that 
side. Such was the confusion and consternation, occa- 
sioned by this sudden discovery of an unknown and unex- 
pected danger, that, though General Sullivan commanded 
the post in person, and exerted all his accustomed energy 
and skill, with the most determined bravery, he found it 
difficult to keep his troops together long enough to meet 
the first onset. The brisk firing from the Bedford quarter 
had disclosed to his whole detachment the alarming fact, 
that their left flank was already turned, and their rear 
completely exposed to the enemy. Apprehending, at 
once, the full danger of their position, and the utter futility 
of any attempt to defend themselves in it, they thought 
only of escaping from the snare, by an instant retreat upon 
their own camp. 

The sudden rout of this party enabled De Heister to 
detach a part of his force upon the upper road to Bedford, 
to fall upon the rear of Colonels Williams and Miles. 
The American lines, in that quarter, had already been 
broken, and driven back into the woods ; while the Bri- 
tish van, led by General Clinton, was moving forward, to 
intercept and engage those who were endeavoring to 
secure their retreat along the direct road from Flatbush. 
Thus attacked both in front and rear, and alternately 
driven by the British on the Hessians, and by the Hes- 
sians back again on the British, they were drawn into a 
succession of skirmishes, in the course of which, some 
considerable parties forced their way through the columns 
of the enemy, and, fighting all the way, as they retreated, 
regained the lines at Brooklyn. Some individuals also 



240 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

saved themselves under cover of the woods, and ultimately 
effected their escape. But a large proportion of the whole 
detachment were either killed or taken prisoners. Gene- 
ral Sullivan was among the latter. Surrounded and 
hemmed in as he was, and with greatly inferior numbers, 
he made a most gallant resistance, and maintained it, with 
such force as he had, more than two hours ; bravely illus- 
trating the difference between a retreat and a flight. 

So silently had Clinton's first grand movement been 
accomplished, and so rapidly had all the subsequent steps 
been taken, that the American right received no notice of 
these events, until the firing in the vicinity of Brooklyn 
announced that the enemy had gained their rear. Lord 
Stirling was sensible of his danger, and perceived that the 
only safety for his division was in an instant retreat. This 
he hoped to effect by crossing Mill Creek, below the 
swamp. To this point Lord Cornwallis had advanced, 
with a view to cut off the retreat of the American right. 
He took his station under cover of a house near the Up- 
per Mills. To cover the intended movement of his detach- 
ment, by occupying Lord Cornwallis till it should be 
achieved, Lord Stirling determined to attack him in per- 
son. For this purpose, six companies of Smallwood's 
regiment of Maryland riflemen were drawn out, and the 
attack was made with great spirit. Several times, suc- 
cessively, they charged the enemy with great bravery, and 
with such admirable effect, that they were on the point 
of dislodging Lord Cornwallis from his post, when, some 
considerable reinforcements arriving to his aid, at the same 
time that General Grant, with his division, advanced upon 
their rear, they were compelled to give way, and follow 
their comrades in the retreat. They were all, with their 
General, made prisoners of war. But they had accom- 
plished the main object of their brave attack, by diverting

the attention of the enemy from the remainder of their 
detachment who, while they were engaged, succeeded, 
with the loss of one man, in crossing the creek, and gain- 
ing the American lines. 

The loss sustained by the Americans, in this battle, has 
been variously estimated. It was probably not far from 
eleven hundred, of whom by far the greater part were 
taken prisoners. The number, who took part in the action, 
was about five thousand. About two-thirds of these were 
with Lord Stirling's division, on the right, most of whom, 
as is seen above, effected their retreat across the creek. 
Of Colonel Hand's regiment, and those of Williams and 
Miles, in the hills between Bedford and Flatbush, a con- 
siderable number made good their retreat. But the larger 
proportion of the prisoners taken, were from this division, 
and their number was afterwards swelled, by the capture, 
at Jamaica, of two hundred of the Long Island militia, 
under General Woodhull, whose movements were wholly 
independent of the army. As General Howe, in his report 
of the battle, stated the number of prisoners, including 
General Woodhull and his corps, at one thousand and 
ninety-seven, the number of killed must have been very 
small. His own loss, killed, wounded and taken, was set 
down at three hundred and sixty-seven. 

In the heat of the action, General Washington passed 
over to the camp at Brooklyn, where he witnessed, with 
feelings, which can better-be imagined than described, the 
utter rout of his choicest troops, without the power of 
relieving them, or of doing anything to change the fate of 
the day. General Putnam had already detached from his 
camp every man that could be spared, consistently with 
the defence of his own position, on which that of New 
York, and the army there, depended. It was more than 
probable that the British commander would follow up the

successes of the day, by combining all his forces for an 
attack upon the American camp. The main body of his 
army was posted a short distance in front of the lines, and 
it was supposed he intended to force them by regular 
approaches, while the ships of war, coming round into the 
East River, and cutting off all communication with New 
York, should equally prevent General Putnam from effect- 
ing a retreat, or receiving reinforcements. In this state of 
things, the numbers of the enemy being greatly superior, 
and elated with recent success, it would have been mad- 
ness to offer him further battle. The entire hope of the 
Americans was in continuing to act on the defensive. 
This was the judgment of Washington, and his council, as 
well before the battle as after it. The relative numbers 
and character of the two armies, and their position during 
the engagement, fully vindicates the soundness of that 
judgment. The subsequent retreat, and the events con- 
nected with, and following it, disclosing the ulterior de- 
signs of the enemy, confirm and establish, beyond a cavil, 
the wisdom of that decision, and show clearly that the fate 
of the whole American army, and with it the American 
cause, was, at that moment, suspended upon the prudent 
generalship of a great commander. 

The unfortunate issue of this battle of Long Island, has 
made it the subject of many and severe comments, by that 
class of critics, who estimate actions only by the measure 
of success which attends them. Some have censured 
freely the Commander-in-chief, while others have laid the 
onus of blame upon General Putnam, charging him with 
unpardonable neglect, in not posting a sufficient force on 
the Jamaica road, to protect the pass. To every charge 
of this kind, it ought to be a sufficient answer, that he was 
unexpectedly assigned to that command on Sunday, the 
25th, and that the pass was taken by General Clinton 



COMMENTS ON THE BATTLE. 243 

before break of day, on Tuesday, the 27th. Without any 
previous knowledge of the posts which had been fortified 
beyond the lines, or the passes by which the enemy could 
make their approach, and with scarcely two days* to make 
himself acquainted with his extended lines, the condition 
of his forces, and the nature of the grounds without, 
through a circuit of more than twenty miles there is cer- 
tainly no show of reason, in attributing the disastrous issue 
of the day, to any lack of watchfulness or activity on his 
part. 

The first duty of the good officer is to execute the orders 
of his superior. It is manifest from the orders of Wash- 
ington, that he regarded the pass on the south as the most 
important, and first to be attended to. To that Putnam, 
accordingly, devoted his first care, and provided it with an 
ample defence. It was stoutly defended, as it was, and 
would have been maintained against all the force of the 
British left, if it had not been attacked in the rear. At the 
same time, the other passes were not overlooked. That, 
by which Clinton came down upon the plain, was provided 
with a patrolling party, whose duty it was to report to the 
commanding officer, any and every movement of the 
enemy in that quarter. The misfortune was, that this 

* General Sullivan, in his letter to the President of Congress, says, 
" General Putnam had taken the command from me four days before 
the action." Colonel Humphreys says it was two days ; and General 
Washington, writing to the President of Congress, on the 23d, four 
days before the battle, says, " I have been obliged to appoint Major- 
General Sullivan to the command on the Island, owing to General 
Greene's indisposition." The only " orders" given to General Put- 
nam, bearing upon this command, are dated of the 25th, to which date 
Marshall assigns the beginning of Putnam's command. Dr. Sparks, 
in a note attached to the above-mentioned order of the 25th, says, 
" Putnam had just been sent over to take the general command on 
Long Island." 



244 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

party suffered a surprise. They were all taken prisoners, 
and thereforeNvere not able to give the desired notice of 
the enemy's approach. 

Both Marshall and Sparks fully vindicate General Put- 
nam from any charge of neglect, or oversight, in this mat- 
ter. The latter* says, " He (Putnam) had not time to 
acquire this knowledge (of the various posts, passes, &c.) 
before the action. The consequence was, that, although 
he was commander on the day of the battle, he never went 
beyond the lines at Brooklyn, and could give no other 
orders, than for sending out troops, to meet the enemy at 
different points." 

Judge Marshall says/f " His (Putnam's) numbers were 
not sufficient to. furnish detachments for all the defiles through 
the mountains ; and, if a corps, capable of making an effec- 
tual resistance, had been posted on this road, and a feint 
had been made upon it, while the principal attack was by the 
direct road from Flatbush, or by that along the coast, the 
events of the day would probably have been not less disas- 
trous. The columns, marching directly from Flatbush, 
must, on every reasonable calculation, have been in pos- 
session of the plains, in the rear of the detachment posted 
on the road from Jamaica, so as to intercept its retreat to 
the camp. So great is the advantage of those who attack, 
in being able to choose the point against which to direct 
their grand effort. 

" The most advisable plan, then, appears to have been, 
to watch the motions of the enemy, so as to be master of 
his designs ; to oppose, with a competent force, every 
attempt to seize the heights ; and to guard all the passes 
in such a manner, as to receive notice of his approach

MARSHALL'S OPINION. 245 

through any of them, in sufficient time, to recall the troops 
maintaining the others. 

" This plan was adapted and the heavy disasters of the 
day, are attributable, principally, to thf, failure of those 
charged with the execution of that very important part of zV, 
which related to the Jamaica road. The letter of General 
Howe states, that an American patrolling party was taken 
on this road ; and General Washington, in a private and 
confidential communication to a friend, says, ' This mis- 
fortune happened, in a great measure, by two detachments 
of our people, who were posted in two roads leading 
through a wood, to intercept the enemy in their march, 
(one of them) suffering a surprise, and (the other) mak- 
ing a precipitate retreat.' 

" The events of this day, too, exhibited a practical de- 
monstration of a radical defect in the structure of the army 
It did not contain a single corps of cavalry. Had the Gene- 
ral been provided with a few troops of light horse, to serve 
merely as vedettes, it is probable that the movement, so 
decisive of the fate of the day, could not have been made 
unnoticed." 

A more complete and triumphant vindication of General 
Putnam, from the charge of neglect, inefficiency, or a lack 
of judgment, decision, or any other martial virtue, in the 
conduct of this affair, could not be desired. If anything is 
wanting to relieve him from all responsibility in relation to 
it, it is found in the fact, that General Washington passed 
the whole of the 26th, the day previous to the battle, at 
Brooklyn, and assisted in all the arrangements for the ex- 
pected action. He was in the camp with Putnam, almost 
up to the very hour when Clinton began his stealthy ad- 
vance from Flatland, to surprise the fatal pass. With 
equal clearness of perception, and force of argument, is the 
generalship, foresight and skill of the Commander-in-chief,

defended from all reproach, by the same masterly hand, 
than whom, for his commanding genius, his fearless impar- 
tiality, and his personal acquaintance with the principal 
actors in these scenes, there can be no better or more 
satisfactory authority. 

The truth is, that the greatest error, committed on this 
occasion, was committed by General Howe, in not follow- 
ing up his victory by an immediate attack on the Ameri- 
can lines. With his superior numbers, and flushed with 
success, he would undoubtedly have carried them, and 
either killed, or made prisoners of the flower of the Ameri- 
can army, at the same time laying open to immediate 
attack, on its most vulnerable side, the main body of the 
reserve in New York. Had he not been greatly deceived 
in his estimate of General Putnam's real strength, he 
would certainly have attempted this move, in which case, 
the great cause of American liberty would have been 
s-taked upon one cast of the die, and that, under circum- 
stances, in which all the advantage was on the side of the 
enemy. 

It may be questioned, indeed, if the defeat of this day 
should not be regarded, rather as a kind, providential inter- 
position, to save the cause of freedom from a sudden and 
hopeless overthrow, than as a disaster. It was deemed 
important and possible, by Congress, by Washington, and 
by a majority of his advisers, to retain possession of New 
York. It was certainly desirable that they should have 
been convinced, by the indirect attack upon the outpost on 
Long Island, that their main position was not tenable, 
rather than to have held it undisturbed, as they would 
have done if the success of this battle had been on their 
side, till the enemy had driven his ships up the North and 
East Rivers which he had shown himself able, by favor 
of wind and tide, to do and landed on the main, above 



MASTERLY RETREAT. 247 

Haerlem River, a sufficient force to confine his antagonist to 
the Island.* Let any one look at the ground, remembering 
that the Americans had no ships, and but few heavy can- 
non, while the British were amply supplied with both, 
and he will be forced to the conclusion, that, if Washing- 
ton made a mistake, in attempting to occupy and defend 
Long Island, in the hope of thereby retaining New York 
as his main position, Howe committed a capital error, in 
making his first attack upon that quarter ; and another, 
of scarcely less importance, in not following up his victory, 
by a bold assault upon Putnam's defences. 

In front of those defences, he immediately fixed his 
camp, and commenced his arrangements to force them, by 
a series of regular approaches. But his prudent enemy 
did not leave him opportunity to finish them. On the 
night of the day succeeding the battle, Clinton broke ground 
for the erection of a battery, within six hundred yards of 
a redoubt on the left. On the same night, the entire 
American force was withdrawn to New York, with such 
silence, order, and despatch, that all the troops and mili- 
tary stores, with the greater part of the provisions, and 
all the artillery, except a few heavy pieces, were carried 
over in safety, before the movement was revealed to the 
enemy. At break of day, the British outposts disco- 
vered the rear-guard crossing the East River, and out of 
the reach of their guns. 

This retreat, in its plan, execution and success, was one 
of those masterly manoeuvres, which distinguish the man 
of commanding genius, consummate skill, and inexhausti- 
ble resources, from the mere military chieftain. To con- 
vey, in boats, during the brief hours of a summer's night, 
across an arm of the sea, half a mile in width, an army of

8th and 14th of September, to the President of

nine thousand men,* with all the arms, ammunition, pro- 
visions, camp equipage and military stores of every de- 
scription, required for lines as extensive as those at 
Brooklyn to accomplish all this in the near vicinity of a 
watchful and victorious foe, and that without the loss of 
a single man, is an achievement, worthy of the ablest ge- 
neral, that ever guided the destinies of war worthy of a 
Hannibal or a Czesar, a Turenne or a Napoleon, a Marl- 
borough or a Wellington worthy of a WASHINGTON. 

Governor's Island was abandoned two days after, so that 
the entire force, then under the immediate command of 
Washington, with the exception of a few detachments 
in the garrisons along the Jersey shore, was concentrated 
on the island of New York. In all these laborious and 
fatiguing operations, during which there was no rest, for 
mind or body, to the commander or any of his principal 
officers, the activity, energy, and unwearied industry of 
General Putnam, were everywhere seen and felt. And, 
although as commander of the abandoned post, he was 
retiring from a lost field, it is certain that he had lost no- 
thing of the confidence or respect of his superior, who had 
been present during a part of the engagement, and wit- 
nessed the difficulties of his position, and the judgment 
with which he had conducted his arrangements for de- 
fence. In the subsequent dispositions of the army, as 
will be seen, he was still assigned to the post of difficulty 
and danger, which is always the post of honor. 

* This was the number that joined in the retreat, five battalions 
having gone over from New York, on the 27th, after the engagement. 
The whole number on the island, at the time of the battle, was seven 
thousand seven hundred the British being considerably more than 
twice as many.

THE British General took immediate possession of all the 
fortified posts on Long Island, extended the line north- 
wardly to Hell Gate, and put the whole in a condition to 
render him effective service. The two armies were sepa- 
rated only by the East River, on both sides of which were 
batteries, which now kept up a continual cannonade upon 
each other; the exposed lines extending nearly to the 
Heights of Haerlem, a distance of about nine miles. 

O I 

Dispositions were immediately made to attack New 
York on every side. A part of the fleet sailed round 
Long Island, and made their appearance in the Sound. 
Two frigates passed up the East river, receiving but little 
injury from the batteries, and anchored behind a small 
island, which protected them from the American guns. 
11* 



250 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

At the same time, the main body of the fleet lay at anchor, 
close in with Governor's Island now in the hands of the 
British ready to pass up either the North or the East 
River, or both, and act against any part of the American 
lines. 

These movements, indicating a purpose, rather to effect 
a landing above, and gain his rear, and thus cut oft' his 
communication with the country, than to attack him in 
his post, General Washington began at once to remove 
such stores as were not immediately necessary, and to 
prepare for an instant evacuation of the city. In the latter 
movement, he was overruled by the decision of a council 
of general officers, which was summoned on the seventh 
of September, to advise him in the present exigency. 
His own opinion, in which Generals Putnam, Greene, and 
a further respectable minority coincided, was in favor of 
un immediate removal. The majority, however, while 
they regarded the post as ultimately untenable, advised 
that a middle course should be taken between abandon- 
ing the city entirely, and concentrating their whole strength 
for its defence. It was, consequently, concluded to arrange 
the army under three divisions ; five thousand to remain 
for the defence of the city, and nine thousand at King's 
Bridge and its dependencies ; the remainder to occupy the 
intermediate space, and be in readiness to support either 
of the other divisions, in case of an attack. 

The rear division, occupying the city, was under the 
command of Major-General Putnam. Generals Greene 
and Spencer were assigned to the centre ; but the whole 
command of that division devolved upon Spencer, Greena 
not having recovered sufficiently to appear at his post 
General Heath commanded the advance. 

In this position they remained five days days of watch 
ing, weariness, and incessant exertion during which the 



AMERICANS DISGRACED AT Kip's BAY 251 

movements of the enemy were such, as to compel the 
officers to change their opinion. Everything indicated an 
immediate attack upon some quarter, though it was impos- 
sible to decide what point they would choose for the assault. 
It was resolved in council on the 12th, to abandon the 
city altogether. From this opinion, Generals Spencer, 
George Clinton, and Heath still dissented. In the mean- 
time, the utmost diligence had been used to remove the 
stores to a place of safety a work which was attended 
with the greatest difficulty, the British ships having taken 
so many positions in the two rivers, as to render the com- 
munication by water of no avail. 

Meanwhile, active preparations were made for the re- 
treat. On Sunday, the fifteenth, those preparations were 
suddenly precipitated, by a decided demonstration on the 
part of the enemy. Under cover of a heavy fire from the 
ships lying in the East River, Sir Henry Clinton, with 
four thousand men, passed over from the head of Newtown 
Inlet, and effected a landing in Kip's bay, about three 
miles above the city. The works at this place were of 
sufficient strength to have withstood the advance of the 
enemy for a considerable time, if the force stationed there 
had been disposed to offer resistance. But they abandon- 
ed them at once, without waiting for an attack. Two 
brigades from General Putnam's division, commanded by 
Parsons and Fellows, being ordered to their support, 
infected with the same panic, broke in the utmost disorder 
on the approach of the enemy, and fled. Their command- 
ers made every effort to rally them, but in vain. Wash- 
ington himself, who flew to the spot, was equally unsuc- 
cessful in his endeavors to arrest their flight, and bring 
them back to their duty. He was so incensed with their 
dastardly conduct, that he drew his sword, and threatened 
them with death, if they did not turn and face the enemy. 



252 LIFE OP GENERAL PUTNAM. 

But they heeded neither menaces nor entreaties, flying 
with such indecent haste, as to leave their General in a 
most exposed and perilous situation, from which he was 
only extricated by some of his immediate attendants seiz- 
ing his bridle, and turning his horse's head from the 
enemy. 

Orders were now given to occupy the heights of Haer- 
lem, where it was resolved to concentrate the whole force 
of the army, and make a desperate stand against the ad- 
vance of the enemy. To that place the Head-Quarters 
of the Commander-in-chief were removed, his own resi- 
dence being at the house of Colonel Morris, about a mile 
and a half below Fort Washington, and nearly midway 
between the Haerlem River and the Hudson. 

About the same time that the landing was effected at 
Kip's Bay, three ships of war moved up the North River 
to Bloomingdale, and commenced offensive operations 
there. In the meantime, General Putnam, with the rem- 
nant of his division, which was strengthened rather than 
weakened by the absence of the two brigades that had so 
shamefully deserted their commander at Kip's Bay, was 
at his post in the city. It was every hour growing more 
and more perilous, as the forces of the enemy, taking one 
position after another, were closing around it. The retreat 
was ordered at the last critical moment, in which it was 
possible to have effected it. The enemy, by the advan- 
tage so basely given them at Kip's Bay, already had pos- 
session of the main road, on the east side of the island, 
which made it necessary to take the route by Blooming- 
dale. That route, also, as we have seen, was now expos- 
ed, in one point at least, to a raking fire from the ships in 
the North River. 

Calling in his pickets and guards, Putnam set his bri- 
gades in motion. The day was oppressively hot, and the 



* 
<r 



MRS. MURRAY. 253 

men suffered so severely from fatigue and thirst, that they 
could scarcely have made a very resolute defence, if the 
enemy had attempted to cut off their retreat. Some faint- 
ed by the way, and some died at the brooks, where they 
halted to drink, by indulging in that luxury to excess. 
Col. Humphreys, who was at this time in Putnam's divi- 
uou, and acting Adjutant to the last regiment that left the 
city, writes thus of the conduct of his general, on that occa- 
sion : " I had frequent opportunities, that day, of beholding 
him, for the purpose of issuing orders, and encouraging his 
troops, flying on his horse, covered with foam, wherever 
his presence was necessary. Without his extraordinary 
exertions, the guards must inevitably have been lost ; and 
it is probable the entire corps would have been cut in 
pieces. When we were not far from Bloomingdale, an 
aide-de-camp came from him at full speed, to inform us 
that a column of British infantry was descending upon our 
right. Our rear was soon fired upon, and the colonel of 
our regiment, whose order was just communicated for the 
front to file off to the left, was killed on the spot." 

The force under Putnam's command at this time was 
about three thousand. They were encumbered with 
wives, children, and all kinds of hangers-on ; with a great 
variety of baggage, tools, camp utensils, and all the num- 
berless and nameless et cetera, which the ancient Romans 
embraced under the appropriate and comprehensive term, 
impediments. These, together with the extreme heat of 
the weather, the narrowness of their routes, and the 
perils which surrounded them, rendered the -retreat an 
arduous and difficult achievement. 

Sir Henry Clinton, having met with nothing to hinder 
his landing, or employ his troops at Kip's bay, immedi- 
ately put them in motion, to cut off the retreat of Putnam 
whose men he supposed were of the same class of sol- 



254 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM.. 

diers, with those he had just encountered, and, therefore, 
little to be feared, whatever might be their numbers, or by 
whomsoever they might be led. In attempting to effect 
this object, he was obliged to pass under the eastern side 
of Murray Hill, where was the residence of a well known 
and worthy old Quaker lady a true-hearted American 
woman, and the mother of Lindley Murray, the celebrated 
grammarian. Feeling that, with his enemy several miles 
in advance, he could not hope to escape him, without the 
aid of some well managed diversion, Putnam sent one of 
his Aids to Mrs. Murray, requesting her, if possible, to 
detain General Clinton, by offering to him and his staff the 
hospitalities of her house, and entertaining his officers, till 
the Americans should have gained the point of the hill. 

Mrs. Murray was well known to many of the British 
officers, and her polite invitation to halt at her door, and 
take a friendly glass of wine, was very courteously accept- 
ed. The quality of the wine was excellent. The society 
and conversation of the ladies was an agreeable episode to 
the stirring scenes of war, and the hour flew by, before 
they were aware that it had begun to wane. At length a 
faithful negro servant, whom she had stationed at the look- 
out on the top of the house, entered the parlor, made a 
sign to his mistress, and instantly retired. Upon this, 
Mrs. Murray, rising with the true dignity of an American 
matron, requested Sir Henry Clinton to follow her, as she 
had something interesting to show him. Ascending to the 
look-out, she pointed out to him the banner of Freedom, 
proudly waving amid the columns of the retiring army ; 
which had now gained the northern side of the hill, and 
was moving in close array, into the open plains of Bloom- 
ingdale. Without waiting for the ordinary etiquette of 
leave-taking, the disconcerted General rushed down, 
sprang upon his horse, and gave orders for instant pursuit- 
\ 



HOWE TAKES POSSESSION OF NEW YORK. 255 

It was a beautiful piece of strategy, delicately managed, 
and ably executed, and proved the turning point in the 
fate of Putnam's division. Says Humphreys : " Before 
our brigades came in, we were given up for lost by all our 
friends. So critical, indeed, was our situation, and so 
narrow the gap by which we escaped, that the instant we 
had passed, the enemy closed it by extending their line 
from river to river." But for the delay at Murray Hill, 
the extension of this line would inevitably have cut off the 
rear, and perhaps brought on a general engagement. 
The British were now landing in force at all the deserted 
posts. Their numbers, already greatly superior to their 
foes, were constantly increasing ; and any attempt to 
accept their offer of battle, would have shown an utter 
destitution of " the better part of valor." But, though 
there was no regular fighting, there was necessarily, as an 
accompaniment to a difficult retreat, and a close pursuit, 
considerable skirmishing, sharp-shooting, and other mutual 
annoyances. General Putnam's loss was not inconsidera- 
ble, having fifteen killed, and three hundred taken prison- 
ers. Nearly all the heavy cannon, and a considerable 
quantity of baggage, stores and provisions, were also left 
behind, and fell into the -hands of the enemy. Most of 
this might have been saved, had General Clinton been 
detained at Kip's bay, by a tolerable defence of that 
post. 

General Howe now took formal possession of New 
York, posting a small force in the city, for the preserva- 
tion of order, and the defence of his rear, and planting the 
main body of his army at the upper end of the island, near 
the American linos. His ri^ht was at Horen's Hook, on 

O ' 

the East River, his left extending to the Hudson, near 
Bloomingdale making a continuous encampment from 



256 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

river to river, two miles in extent both flanks being cover- 
ed by the ships. 

The Americans were strongly posted at King's Bridge, 
the natural position of the place being favorable for works 
of defence. There was also a strong force at Morris's 
Heights ; and another at Haerlem and McGowan's Pass, 
within about a mile and a half of the British lines. Each 
of these posts was so fortified, as to be supposed capable 
of being defended against superior numbers. The distance 
between Haerlem and King's Bridge is between five and 
six miles Morris's Heights being nearly half way be- 
tween. Of the advanced posts, General Putnam com- 
manded the right at McGowan's Pass, and General Spen- 
cer the left, at Haerlem. 

It was Washington's desire, to embrace every opportu- 
nity to give his men some active service, without bringing 
on a general engagement. By thus habituating them, in a 
series of skirmishes, to meet the enemy in the field, he 
hoped to show them what they were capable of doing, and 
encourage them to entertain confidence in themselves 
An opportunity was soon offered to gratify this desire. 

The day after the retreat from New York, several par- 
ties of the enemy appeared in the plains between the two 
camps. On receiving intelligence of this movement, Gene- 
ral Washington rode quickly to the out-posts, to order 
the necessary dispositions to meet it. Soon after his 
arrival, Lieutenant-Colonel Knowlton, of the Continental 
division, and one of Putnam's bravest officers, who, with 
a fine corps of Yankee Rangers, had been skirmishing 
with one of the advanced parties of the enemy, came in 
and reported their numbers at about three hundred. Some 
of them were concealed in a wood, in the rear of a small 
eminence. The General ordered Knowlton, with his 
rangers, assisted by Major Leitch, with three companies

from Weedon's regiment of Virginians, to make an effort 
to gain their rear, and cut them off, or bring them in as 
prisoners ; while, to divert them from this movement, 
another party should attack them in front. 

As soon as this attack was attempted, the British re- 
treated with some precipitation, in order to secure a more 
advantageous position, under cover of some fences and 
bushes, which skirted the hill. A brisk but distant and 
ineffectual fire immediately commenced. In the mean- 
time, Colonel Knowlton, who had not been informed of 
this new position of the enemy, having made his circuit, 
came upon them with great bravery, but, unfortunately, 
rather in flank than in rear. A warm action ensued. 
Major Leitch was soon brought from the field, severely 
wounded in three places. The gallant Knowlton fell, 
mortally wounded, soon after. Their men, notwithstand- 
ing the loss of their commanders, stood their ground, and 
maintained the conflict with the greatest resolution, under 
the lead of their brave and experienced captains. Being 
reinforced from the camp, they charged the enemy with 
such intrepidity, as to compel him to leave his covert ; 
and would have driven him from the field altogether, had 
not General Howe sent a battalion of Hessian grenadiers 
and a company of chasseurs to his aid. Not wishing to 
bring on a general action, or expose himself to unnecessary 
loss, Washington ordered a retreat. 

In this affair, the loss of the British was ascertained to 
be about a hundred. That of the Americans was not 
half that number ; but the difference was more than bal- 
anced by the fall of the two brave leaders, Knowlton and 
Leitch. The former was a special favorite with General 
Putnam. He was trained up under his own eye, having 
entered the army, under his command, at the early age of 
sixteen, and served with him in most of those brilliant

affairs, which distinguished his name in the Seven Years* 
War. He was with him in the forest of Wood Creek, 
where he was taken prisoner. He was with him in the 
expedition to Montreal, under General Amherst ; and in 
the closing scene of that protracted conflict, the expedition 
to Havana ; having been promoted through all the 
grades, from a private to a lieutenancy, before he was 
twenty-one years of age. He was one of the foremost, 
under his old commander, to rush to the rescue, on the 
breaking out of hostilities at Lexington ; and was the 
General's right hand man in the skirmish at Noddle Island, 
and in the battle of Bunker Hill. He was also in the heat 
of the action on Long Island, and effected his escape with 
great difficulty. He entered the Revolutionary service as 
a captain, and, in less than a year, had risen to a lieuten- 
ant-colonelcy. Colonel Burr, who was intimately ac- 
quainted with him, and sometimes associated with him in 
service, remarked that " it was impossible to promote 
such an officer too rapidly." He lived an hour after his 
fall, and had the satisfaction of receiving from the lips of 
Washington, an unqualified commendation of his conduct 
on all occasions ; and from Putnam the assurance that to 
him, and his division, his loss was 'irreparable. He died 
at the age of thirty -six, lamented by the army and the 
country, but by no one more than the General, who had 
trained him to war, and knew how well he could rely 
upon him in the most trying exigencies of the service. 

This little skirmish, though attended with so serious a 
loss, had an important effect upon the American army. 
It encouraged them to face the enemy boldly, and to be- 
lieve themselves capable of victory, under all the inequali- 
ties of their condition. They had wiped away the stain 
of the previous day, and they resolved that no such das- 
tardly act should again tarnish the name of the defenders 



HOOR TO THE BRAVE. 259 

of liberty. To encourage this sentiment, as well as to do 
justice to bis able and faithful soldiers, Washington pub- 
licly commended their conduct in the following 

"ORDERS. 

" Head Quarters, Haerlem Heights, Sept. 17, 1776. 
" Parole, Leitch ; countersign, Virginia. 

" The General most heartily thanks the troops, com- 
manded yesterday by Major Leitch, who first advanced 
upon the enemy, and the others who so resolutely sup- 
ported them. The behavior yesterday was such a con- 
trast to that of some of the troops the day before, as must 
show what may be done, where officers and soldiers will 
exert themselvef Once more, therefore, the General 
calls upon officrrj and men, to act up to the noble cause 
in which they are engaged, and to support the honor and 
liberties of their country. 

" The gallant and brave Colonel Knowlton, who would 
have been an honor to any country, having fallen yester- 
day, while gloriously fighting, Captain Brown is to take 
command of the party, lately led by Colonel Knowlton. 
Officers and men are to obey him accordingly." 

If the army of the Revolution had been composed, in 
chief, of such men as these, the contest would have been 
of shorter duration, and the toils and anxieties of the gene-^ 
ral officers infinitely less severe. But, unfortunately, they 
were mostly of a different class, while the circumstances 
and terms, under which they engaged in the war, rendered 
them far less serviceable and trustworthy, than the same 
men might have been under a different system. An ex- 
tract from one of Washington's letters of this period, ad- 
dressed to the President of Congress, will show the matter 
at a glance : " To place any dependence upon militia is

assuredly resting upon a broken staff. Men, just dragged 
from the tender scenes of domestic life, unaccustomed to 
the din of arms, totally unacquainted with every kind of 
military skill (which is followed by a want of confidence 
in themselves, when opposed to troops regularly trained, 
disciplined, and appointed, superior in knowledge, and 
superior in arms), are timid, and ready to fly from their 
own shadows. Besides, the sudden change in their man- 
ner of living brings on an unconquerable desire to return 
to their homes, and produces the most shameful and scan- 
dalous desertions. Again, men accustomed to unbounded 
freedom, cannot brook the restraint, which is indispensably 
necessary to the good order and government of an army, 
without which, licentiousness and every kind of disorder 
triumphantly reign." 

Such were the unpromising materials, out of which these 
able officers were compelled to fashion an army, to resist 
the best troops of the most powerful nation on the globe. 
It must be admitted that none but the most able and com- 
petent officers, with a righteous cause to sustain, could 
have accomplished the herculean task.

THE British commander, aware of the advantages which 
his enemy would derive from a series of partisan skir- 
mishes, under cover of his intrenchments, was as desirous 
to bring on a general engagement, as Washington was to 
avoid it. The latter, sensible of his great inferiority in 
numbers, discipline, experience, and equipment, was, at 
the same time, confident in the slfength of his defences, 
and his ability to repel, with advantage, any assault that 
might be made upon them. He, therefore, prudently con- 
tented himself with annoying and weakening his adver- 
sary, whenever opportunity offered, rather than by bolder 
and more brilliant movements, hazarding his whole cause 
upon on3 cast of the die. In constant readiness for an 
attack, which, if made anywhere, was to be expected at 



262 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

the advanced post, at McGowan's Pass, where General 
Putnam was stationed, he gave orders to General Spencer, 
who commanded at Haerlem, to be prepared to reinforce 
that Pass, at a moment's warning. But the enemy pru- 
dently refrained from any attempt upon the defences. 

Among the multitude of cares which bore upon the 
mind of General Washington, at this period, was the pro- 
tection of the property of American citizens especially 
that of persons known, or supposed, to be attached to the 
royal cause. The army was composed, in great part, .of 
men who made no scruple of plundering whatever they 
could lay their hands upon, and burning, or otherwise 
destroying, what they could not carry away. Every effort 
was made, on the part of the General, to punish and sup- 
press this spirit of rapacity, but the means .within his 
power were hardly adequate to the end. On the 24th of 
September, he addressed a strong representation to Con- 
gress on the subject. " Of late," says he, " a practice 
prevails of the most alarming nature, and which will, if it 
cannot be checked, prove fatal both to the country and the 
army I mean the infamous practice of plundering. For, 
under the idea of Tory property, or property that may 
fall into the hands of the enemy, no man is secure in his 
effects, and scarcely in his person. In order to get at 
them, we have several instances of people being frightened 
out of their houses, under pretence of those houses being 
ordered to be burnt ; and this is done with a view of seiz- 
ing the goods. Nay, in order that the villainy may be 
more effectually concealed, some houses have actually 
been burned to cover the theft. I have, with some others, 
used my utmost endeavors to stop this horrid practice." 
In these endeavors, he was constantly and zealously aided 
by General Putnam, who abhorred every species of rob- 
bery and injustice ; and who, in the discharge of the com- 



THE BRITISH LAND AT FROG'S POINT 263 

mon duties of equity and humanity, recognized no differ- 
ence between patriot and tory, or friend and foe. His 
good offices, in this respect, secured for him the confidence 
and respect of many among the enemies of his cause ; 
while some of his own countrymen, whose party prejudices 
obscured their sense of private right, did not hesitate to 
condemn a virtue, to which they did not pretend to aspire. 

General Howe, finding that he could neither force the 
American defences, nor decoy them into an action where 
all the advantage would be on his side, resolved to make 
another effort to gain their rear, cut them off from all sup- 
plies, and so compel them to an unconditional surrender. 
With this view, leaving a sufficient force below for the 
protection of New York, he sent several frigates up the 
North River, which came to an anchor at some distance 
above Fort Washington having passed the batteries at 
that place and Fort Lee, without material damage. A 
few days after, on the 12th of October, he embarked a 
great part of his army in flat bottomed boats, and, passing 
through Hell Gate into the Sound, landed at Frog's 
Point, near the town of Westchester, about nine miles 
above the camp on the Heights of Haerlem. 

Frog's Neck is covered with water, at full tide ; and 
the Point, on which the British had landed, was connect- 
ed with the main by bridges. These bridges the Ame- 
ricans took good care to destroy ; at the same time, 
throwing up some slight works, to obstruct the enemy in 
his march. The road from this place to King's Bridge, 
led through a difficult country, intersected everywhere by 
stone walls ; rendering the passage of artillery, or even of 
infantry in compact order, almost impracticable. 

On the 18th, General Howe, being strongly reinforced, 
moved forward, with all his force, to New Rochelle. 
Some skirmishing took place on the march, in which the 






264 LIFE Or GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Americans fought with great bravery, and gained some ad- 
vantages. At New Rochelle, the British army was still fur- 
ther strengthened, and soon commenced a movement towards 
White Plains. The main body of the American troops 
formed a long line of intrenched camps, extending from 
twelve to thirteen miles, on the different heights from Va- 
lentine's Hill, near King's Bridge, to White Plains, front- 
ing the British line of march, and the River Bronx, which 
divided the two armies. 

It was while the two armies were watching each other 
in this position, that Colonel Haslet succeeded in surpris- 
ing Colonel Rogers,* " the late worthless Major," as he 
calls him, at Mamaroneck, taking thirty-six prisoners, a 
pair of colors, sixty stand of arms, and other valuable 
booty. About the same time, Colonel Hand, with a regi- 
ment of Pennsylvanian riflemen, engaged an equal number 
of Hessian chasseurs, with considerable advantage. 

General Washington was encamped on high broken 
ground, his right flank resting on the Bronx, which, by a 
bold curve at this place, covered also the front of his 
right wing, extending along the road towards New Ro- 
chelle, as far as the brow of the hill on which his centre 
was posted. His left, forming almost a right angle with 
his centre, and nearly parallel to his right, extended along 
the hills northward, so as to keep possession of the com- 
manding ground, and secure a retreat, should it be neces- 
sary, to a still stronger position in his rear. General 
McDougall, with a detachment of sixteen hundred men, 
principally militia, occupied Chatterton's Hill, on the west 
side of the Bronx, about a mile from the camp. The 
river being fordable at that place, his communication with 
the main army was open. 

General Howe having advanced in force, on the 28th, 
* Appendix, No. 1. 



ACTION AT CHATTERTON'S HILL. 265 N 

to attack General Washington in his camp, determined, as 
a measure preliminary to a general assault, to dislodge 
General McDougall from this post. He, therefore, directed 
Colonel Rahl, with a brigade of Hessians, to make a circuit 
so as to gain his rear, while Brigadier-General Leslie, 
with a strong corps of British and Hessian troops, should 
attack him in front. This being done with great vigor, the 
militia in the front rank immediately gave way ; but Colo- 
nel Haslet's Delaware regiment, Colonel Smallwood's 
Maryland battalion, and Colonel Reitzimer's New York 
corps, advanced boldly, and in good order, to meet the 
foe, and gallantly defended their post, till they were over- 
powered by numbers ; when they reluctantly retired, keep- 
ing up, in their retreat, an irregular, but not ineffectual 
fire, from behind the stone walls that lined the way 
General Putnam, receiving orders to support General 
McDougall, hastened to the scene of action, with a con- 
siderable detachment. But the post was already aban- 
doned to the enemy, and its late defenders were met in 
full retreat towards the camp. Notwithstanding this rein- 
forcement, it was deemed unadvisable to attempt to 
regain the hill, and all moved on, in order, to rejoin the 
main army. 

The loss in this action has been variously stated by his- 
torians. The most probable report makes that of the 
Americans not much over two hundred, with nearly double 
that number to the British. 

A general assault was now momentarily expected, and 
every arrangement was made for it in the British camp, 
the whole army reposing on their arms, in order of battle, 
during the night. But, perceiving in the morning that 
Washington had improved the night, in adding to the 
strength of his works, and disposing his forces to better 
advantage to meet the expected attack, Howe concluded 
13 



266 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

to postpone further offensive operations, till the arrival of 
six battalions, which had been ordered up, under com- 
mand of Lord Percy. A violent rain, which fell imme- 
diately on the accession of this reinforcement, occasioned 
a further delay. General Washington, having, in the 
meantime, removed his provisions and heavy baggage to a 
stronger position at North Castle, about five miles distant, 
availed himself of the darkness of the night, on the first of 
November, to withdraw his whole army to that place 
Deeming this post too strong to be attempted with pru- 
dence, General Howe changed his plans, and directed his 
attention to Forts Washington and Lee, which, being still 
ably garrisoned by the Americans, proved a check upon 
the contemplated movements of the British commander, 
by leaving a well-posted enemy in his rear. His first 
effort was against Fort Independence, at King's Bridge, 
upon which a descent was made by General Knyphausen. 
The garrison abandoned it on his approach, and retreated 
to Fort Washington, followed by Knyphausen, who 
pitched his camp between the two forts. In the mean- 
time, General Howe, with his whole force, retired slowly 
down the North River, towards New York. 

Apprehending, from these new movements, that an inva- 
sion into New Jersey was intended, Washington detached 
all the troops belonging to the States west of the Hudson, 
five thousand in number, under command of General Put 
nam, to provide against such a design. They crossed the 
river on the 8th of November, and took post at Hacken 
sack, which they reached after a circuitous route of sixty 
miles, to avoid the parties of the enemy. General Greene 
was in command at Fort Lee, on that side of the river, 
and was now invested with discretionary powers, in rela- 
tion to the defence of Fort Washington, on the New York 
side, towards which the British were concentrating their 



LOSS OF FORT WASHINGTON. 267 

movements. It had been intended and resolved, by the 
strong recommendations of Congress, to maintain these 
two posts to the last extremity. The Commander-in- 
chief believed that this last extremity had already come, 
and that it was vain to attempt to hold them, in the pre- 
sent position of affairs. General Greene entertained a dif- 
ferent opinion, in which he appears to have been sustain- 
ed by General Putnam, and consequently availed himself 
of the discretion allowed him, to reinforce Colonel McGaw, 
with directions to defend the post at every hazard. 

General Howe, in retiring southward, encamped near 
King's Bridge on the 13th. On the 15th, he summoned 
the garrison to surrender, on pain of being put to the 
sword. Colonel McGaw replied, with becoming manli- 
ness, that he should defend the place to the last extremity ; 
and immediately communicated the summons, with his 
answer, to General Greene, who transmitted them to the 
Commander-in-chief, then just arrived at Hackensack. 
Washington proceeded at once to Fort Lee, and, though 
late in the night, was hastening over to Fort Washington, 
whither Generals Putnam and Greene had already gone. 
In crossing the river, however, he met those officers on 
their return. They reported the garrison in high spirits, 
ready and able to make a good defence, and General 
Washington returned with them to Fort Lee. The next 
day the fort was carried by storm, with a loss of nearly 
three thousand men, by far the most severe that had yet 
befallen the American army. The loss of the British was 
about eight hundred. 

The evacuation of Fort Lee was a necessary conse- 
quence upon the loss of Fort Washington, and immediate 
preparations were made for the removal of the stores. 
Before this could be completed, however, Lord Cornwal- 
lis had crossed the North River, with a strong detachment 



268 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

of six thousand men, and made an attempt to enclose the 
garrison, upon the narrow neck of land, between the North 
and Hackensack Rivers. By a rapid and well-conducted 
movement, they were so fortunate as to escape, with all 
their ammunition and small arms ; their heavy cannon, 
with several hundred tents, a large quantity of baggage, 
and valuable stores, being unavoidably left behind. 

The retreat across the Hackensack, left the American 
army in a position but 'little better than that which they 
had just left. The Passaic runs nearly parallel with that 
river for many miles. They were consequently in the 
same danger, as before, of being enclosed between two 
barriers, which it would be difficult to pass. There was, 
therefore, no alternative but to retreat still further across 
the Passaic. Their forces were daily diminishing, by the 
withdrawal of great numbers of the militia, who, dispirited 
by their late reverses, returned to their homes as fast as 
their terms of enlistment expired, so that, by the last of 
November, Washington had scarcely three thousand men 
under his immediate command. These were exposed in 
an open country, amon^ a part of the people by no means 
cordially favorable to the cause of Independence, without 
intrenching tools, without stores, without tents to shelter 
them from the growing inclemency of the season. 

A division of three thousand five hundred men, under 
General Heath, had been stationed among the Highlands, 

/ . o O * 

for the defence of the Hudson, and the mountain passes. 
Another division of four thousand, many of whom were 
militia, whose term of service was soon to expire, was 
left in the camp at White Plains, commanded by General 
Lee, with discretionary instructions, to continue on that 
side of the Hudson, or to follow the Commander-in-chief 
into New Jersey, according to the movements of the 
enemy 



GLOOMY PROSPECTS. 269 

Newark, New Brunswick, Princeton, and Trenton, suc- 
cessively fell into the hands of the enemy, as they were 
successively abandoned by the retreating " phantom of an, 
army ;" and, finally, on the eighth of December, Washing- 
ton crossed the Delaware, then the only barrier which pre- 
vented the British from taking possession of Philadelphia. 
So rapidly had the pursuit been urged, that the rear of one 
army was often within sight and shot of the van of the other ; 
and before one party had completed the destruction of the 
bridges, by which they fled, the other had commenced 
repairing them for the pursuit. 

It was the darkest period in the history of the Revolu- 
tion. The campaign, now so darkly closed, had been a 
continued series of disasters and retreats. The enemy 
was now in possession of Rhode Island, Long Island, the 
City of New York, Staten Island, and almost the whole 
State of New Jersey, and was apparently on the point of 
extending his conquests into Pennsylvania. The com- 
mander of the victorious army, in conjunction with his 
brother, the Admiral, had issued a proclamation, which 
was widely scattered on every side, offering a full pardon, 
in the name of his Majesty, to all who should take the 
oath of allegiance, and come under his protection, within 
sixty days. Great numbers, and among them men of for- 
tune and respectability, had accepted the terms, and gone 
over to the enemy. Others, especially in New Jersey, 
took the oath, but did not leave their usual places of abode. 
In short, so great was the panic, and so dark the prospect, 
that a general despondency pervaded the continent. Many 
of the strongest spirits quailed before the accumulating 
difficulties that encompassed the cause of freedom. Wash- 
ington stood firm and unmoved as a rock. " Undismayed 
by the dangers which surrounded him, he did not for an 
instant relax his exertions, or omit anything which could 



270 I. IFF. OF GENERAL PUTXAM. 

obstruct the progress of the enemy, or improve his own 
condition. He did not, for a moment, appear to despair 
of the public safety, but struggled against adverse fortune, 
with the hope of yet vanquishing the difficulties which 
encompassed him ; and constantly showed himself to his 
harassed and enfeebled army with a serene, unembarrassed 
countenance, betraying no fears in himself, and invigorat- 
ing and inspiring with confidence the bosoms of others." 
Among his principal officers, none was more hopeful, 
more courageous, more determined than General Putnam. 
Through all this season of peril, disaster and discourage- 
ment, he was ever at his Commander's side, and was 
among the last of the fugitive band, that crossed the Dela- 
ware, and drew up its diminished lines on the other 
side, not to give over the fight in despair, but, like a hunt- 
ed wolf at bay, to turn upon its pursuers with redoubled 
fierceness, and drive them back from the field they had so 
lately won.

GENERAL HOWE, having now, as he supposed, broken the 
spirits, as well as scattered the forces, of the rebel army, 
promised himself a certain and easy victory. His next 
immediate object was the possession of Philadelphia ; 
through which so large a portion of the American supplies 
were obtained, that, in the earnest language of Washington, 
" upon the salvation of that place, their cause almost 
depended." With this view of its importance, and with 
a determination to leave no effort untried to secure it 
against the approach of the enemy, General Putnam was 
sent forward to take the command, and to superintend the 
works to be erected for its defence 



372 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

In a letter from General Washington to the President 
of Congress, under date of the 9th of December, after 
remarking " that the security of Philadelphia should be 
our next object," he suggests, that " a communication of 
lines and redoubts might be formed from the Delaware to 
the Schuylkill, on the north entrance of the city to begin 
on the Schuylkill side, and run eastward to the Delaware, 
upon the most advantageous and commanding grounds. 
We have ever found," he continues, " that lines, how- 
ever slight, are very formidable to the enemy ; they would 
at least give a check, till the people could recover from 
the fright and consternation, that naturally attend the first 
appearance of an enemy. 

" In the meantime, every step should be taken to col- 
lect a force, not only from Pennsylvania, but from the 
neighboring States. If we can keep the enemy from enter- 
ing Philadelphia, and keep the communication by water 
open for supplies, we may yet make a stand, if the coun- 
try will come to our assistance till the new levies be col- 
lected. * * * 

" P. S. General Mifflin is this moment come up, and 
tells me, that all the military stores yet remain in Phila- 
delphia. This makes the immediate fortifying of the city 
so necessary, that I have desired General Mifflin to return 
and take charge of the stores ; and have ordered Major- 
General Putnam immediately down, to superintend the 
works, and give the necessary directions." 

The difficulties to be encountered in this new sphere of 
action, were many and severe. But the hardy old veteran 
proved himself equal to them all. Here, as well as in 
New York, there were many persons strongly disaffected 
towards the American cause 'men, who, from attachment 
to royalty, or from fear of losing their property, shrunk 
from the unequal contest, or lent their aid, secretly, to 



SEVERE LABORS IN PHILADELPHIA. 273 

further the designs of the enemy. Many of them were 
so decided in their hostility, that it was at one time 
thought unsafe to withdraw the forces from the city, 
though their aid was much needed to strengthen the army 
in the field, lest, in their absence, the whole city should 
declare for the enemy. It was this, as will be seen here- 
after, that deprived General Putnam of a share in one of 
the most brilliant and successful enterprises of the army 
of the Revolution. 

The danger apprehended from the steady approaches of 
General Howe was imminent, and the works of defence 
were required to be constructed with the greatest des- 
patch. The labor was severe and unintermitting, and 
General Putnam never spared himself, when there, was 
work to be done, any more than when danger was to be 
braved. " His personal industry," says Humphreys, who 
was with him at this time, " was unparalleled, and his 
health was, for a while, impaired by his unrelaxed exer- 
tions." The city was placed under martial law, and his 
authority, during his command in it, was paramount and 
supreme. But he made no unnecessary display of his 
power, scrupulously avoiding everything that would need- 
lessly disturb the usual order, or restrain the usual free- 
dom of intercourse among the citizens. He made a dili- 
gent use both of authority and example, to conciliate, as 
far as possible, the contending factions, to win over the 
disaffected to the cause of freedom, and to excite all the 
citizens to use their utmost diligence in preparing to repel 
the expected approach of the enemy. He took good care, 
as he had done in New York, to regulate and sustain the 
police of the city, by bringing his own military authority 
to bear upon it, and by encouraging a cheerful Sbedience 
to the laws. The following order will illustrate his care 
and prudence in this respect : 
R

" GENERAL ORDERS. 
" Head Quarters, Philadelphia, Dec. 14, 1776 

" Colonel Griffin is appointed Adjutant-General to the 
troops in and about this city. All orders from the Gene- 
ral through him, either written or verbal, are to be strictly 
attended to, and punctually obeyed. 

" In case of an alarm by fire, the city guards and pa- 
troles are to suffer the inhabitants to pass, unmolested, at 
any hour of the night ; and the good people of Philadel- 
phia are earnestly requested and desired to give every 
assistance in their power, with engines and buckets, to 
extinguish the fire. And, as the Congress have ordered 
the city to be defended to the last extremity, the General 
hopes that no person will refuse to give every assistance 
possible, to complete the fortifications that are to be erect- 
ed in and about the city. 

" ISRAEL PUTNAM. 1 ' 

Soon after his arrival in Philadelphia, General Putnam 
was called, with General Mifflin, to a special conference 
with Congress upon the expediency of adjourning their 
meeting to some place less exposed to interruption from 
the enemy. By their advice, and urgent counsels, and 
directly in the face of a vote taken only the day before, 
the resolution to adjourn was adopted on the 12th of De- 
cember, to assemble in Baltimore on the 20th. 

The labor of constructing fortifications was regular and 
monotonous, and but few incidents of sufficient interest to 
be recorded, marked the toilsome residence of the General 
in this capital. Everything was proceeding well and 
prosperously under his direction, when he was suddenly 
called off from this position, to take part in other and more 
important movements of the army. 

Contrary to all expectation, and to all human proba- 



PROPOSED ATTACK ON MOUNT HOLLY. 275 

bility, General Washington, with the poor remnant of an 
army that had escaped with him over the Delaware, had 
suddenly recrossed that river, in the dead of winter, and 
struck a blow upon the victorious and too confident enemy 
at Trenton, that astonished alike both friend and foe 
reviving and inspiriting the one, as much as it discomfited 
and chagrined the other. Before the enemy had quite 
recovered from the panic occasioned by this masterly 
movement, the American general had crossed the Dela- 
ware the second time, and, prudently avoiding the prof- 
ferred encounter with Lord Cornwallis, had struck another 
blow upon Princeton, killing and capturing almost an 
entire regiment. 

It was a part of his original design, in planning these 
bold movements, to unite the troops employed in fortify- 
ing Philadelphia, with those of Brigadier-General Cad- 
wallader at Bristol, and to place the whole under the 
command of General Putnam, with a view to carrying the 
post at Mount Holly, about ten miles back of Burlington, 
where the advanced guard of the British army was posted. 
But so alarming were the indications, at that time, of an 
insurrection in the city, in favor of the royal cause, that 
the execution of this part of the plan was entrusted to 
General Cadwallader alone ; and General Putnam remain- 
ed at his post, to prosecute the works of defence which 
were to guard against an invading enemy from without, 
and to quell the incipient organization of a more dangerous 
enemy within. He was, therefore, denied the opportu- 
nity which to his active and enterprising spirit would 
have seemed one of the privileges of the service of sharing 
in two of the most brilliant achievements which distin- 
guished the Revolutionary War. Had the original plan 
been carried out, and the river been found passable, at the 
place appointed for crossing, there is no doubt that it 



276 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

would have been completely successful, and greatly en- 
hanced the advantages of that glorious day. It was ascer- 
tained, by persons despatched to reconnoitre the post at 
Mount Holly, that the soldiers were in a state of compara- 
tive helplessness from intoxication having indulged freely 
in spirituous liquors the preceding day, which was Christ- 
mas-day. There was no apprehension of danger, and no 
precaution to guard against it. 

On the eve of the execution of the first of these enter- 
prises, the Commander-in-chief addressed a letter to Gene- 
ral Putnam, expressing his great satisfaction in learning 
the improved state of his health which had been impair- 
ed by his excessive labors and exposures and informing 
him that the design of the enemy to gain early possession 
of Philadelphia, was fully confirmed, by an intercepted 
letter from a gentleman of Philadelphia, who had joined 
the enemy, to his partner in that city, which declared that 
their plans were laid to enter it within twenty days, or as 
soon as the ice in the river should be sufficiently strong to 
enable them to transport their artillery across it. He 
added, that, if the citizens of Philadelphia had any regard 
for the town, not a moment's time was to be lost, until 
it should be put in the best possible posture of defence. 
Fearing that, through their indifference, or the want of 
time to accomplish it, this would not be done, he directed 
all the public stores, except such as were necessary for 
immediate use, to be removed at once to places of greater 
security. 

Ten days after, on the 5th of January, 1777, Washing- 
ton wrote to Putnam, from Pluckemin, giving an account 
of his second successful stroke, and expressing the hope 
as the enemy appeared to be quite panic-struck that he 
should be able to drive them out of the Jerseys. The 
new aspect which their late brilliant successes had put 



TAKES POST AT PRINCETON. 277 

upon the American cause, so completely changed the cur- 
rent of popular opinion, that the defection of Philadelphia 
was no longer feared, and Putnam could now be spared 
from that post. He was, accordingly, ordered to take the 
field, and assist in pushing the advantages so unexpectedly 
gained. " It is thought advisable for you," continues the 
letter, " to march the troops under your command to Cross- 
wicks, and keep a strict watch upon the enemy in that 
quarter. If the enemy continues at Brunswick, you must 
act with great circumspection, lest you meet with a sur- 
prise. As we have made two successful attacks upon 
them by surprise, if there is any possibility of retaliating, 
they will attempt it. You will give out your strength to 
be twice as great as it is.* Forward on all the baggage 
and scattered troops belonging to this division of the army 
as soon as may be. 

" You will keep as many spies out as you shall see 
proper. A number of horsemen, in the dress of the coun- 
try, must be constantly kept going backwards and forwards 
for this purpose, and if you discover any motion of the 
enemy, which you can depend upon, and which you think 
of consequence, let me be informed thereof as soon as 
possible, by express. 

" I am, dear General, yours, &c." 

In obedience to these orders, General Putnam took the 
field at once, leaving suitable directions for the prosecution 
of the works of defence in the city. The design of the 
Americans was to hold the advantages already gained, and 
to harass the enemy, by all the means in their power for 

* So successfully was this species of deception practised upon the 
enemy, that letters from officers in the army to their fi lends in 
England, represented the Americans, at this very time, as forty thou- 
sand strong. See Almon's Remembrancer. 



278 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

they had neither men nor ammunition to attempt a battle. 
They had succeeded in driving them from all their newly 
acquired posts in the Jerseys, except Brunswick and Am- 
boy, and had thus opened to themselves a large field for 
supplies, and given encouragement to multitudes of those, 
who, while they were at heart friendly to the American 
cause, had begun to despair of ever bringing it to a suc- 
cessful issue. 

Putnam's* first movement was to Crosswicks, a few 
miles southeast of Trenton, on one of the routes by which 
the enemy might attempt to regain his lost position at 
Mount Holly. As no attempt was made to do this, and 
Howe's forces seemed to be concentrating for winter quar- 
ters, Putnam was ordered to advance to Princeton. At 
this post he continued, during the remainder of the winter, 
within fifteen miles from the enemy's stronghold at Bruns- 
wick. His force was exceedingly small, never more than 
a few hundred. At one period, from a sudden diminution, 
occasioned by the withdrawal of those wliose terms of 
enlistment had expired, and who peremptorily refused to 
remain till their places could be supplied by new recruits, 
he had fewer men on duty than he had miles of frontier 
to guard. There was no time, during the winter, when 
he could have sustained, for a single hour, the attack of a 
respectable body of regulars. Yet, so good a front did he 
maintain, and so successfully did he blind the eyes of his 
adversary to his real position and strength, that no effort 
was made to dislodge him. 

Among the British who were left on the field at the 
battle of Princeton, was Captain M'Pherson, of the 17th 
regiment, a very worthy Scotchman, who was desperately 
wounded through the lungs. He had been left for dead, 
and on General Putnam's arrival on the ground, he found 
him languishing in extreme distress, without a surgeon, 



STORT OF M'PHERSOM. 279 

without a single accommodation, and without a friend to 
solace the troubled spirit in the hour of death. He visited 
him, and immediately caused every possible comfort to be 
administered to him. Captain M'Pherson, who, contrary 
to all appearances, recovered, after having demonstrated 
to General Putnam the dignified sense of obligations which 
a generous mind wishes not to conceal, one day, in familiar 
conversation, demanded " Pray, Sir, what countryman 
are you ?" "An American," answered the latter. " Not 
a Yankee ?" said the other. " A full blooded one," 
replied the General. " I am sorry for that," rejoined 
M'Pherson, " I did not think there could be so much 
goodness and generosity in an American, or, indeed, in 
anybody but a Scotchman." 

While the recovery of Captain M'Pherson was doubt 
ful, he desired that General Putnam would allow a friend 
in the British army at Brunswick, to come and assist him 
in making out his will. Putnam had then only fifty men 
in his command the remainder being out, in detachments, 
to cover and protect the country. He was, consequently, 
very much embarrassed by this proposition. He was not 
content that a British officer should have an opportunity 
to spy out his weakness, nor was it in his nature to refuse 
complying v'th a dictate of humanity. He luckily 
thought of an expedient, which he hastened to put into 
practice. A flag of truce was despatched with Captain 
M'Pherson's request, but under an injunction not to return 
until after dark. In the evening, lights were placed in all 
the rooms of the College, and in every apartment of the 
vacant houses throughout the town. During the whole 
night, the fifty men, sometimes all together, and sometimes 
in small detachments, were marched from different quar- 
ters, by the house in which M'Pherson lay. It was 
afterwards known, that M'Pherson's friend, on his return, 



280 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

reported that General Putnam's army, upon the most mo- 
derate calculation, could not consist of less than four or 
five thousand men. 

The harshness and cruelty of the invaders, and particu- 
larly the German mercenaries, during the period of their 
temporary occupancy of New Jersey, reacted with a most 
salutary effect upon the American cause, alienating from 
the British interest the affections of those who had been 
hitherto loyal, confirming in their opposition those who 
had before espoused the cause of liberty, and rousing to 
instant and spirited revolt such as had been compelled to 
take sides with the conquerors, or at least to render a 
seeming submission. The humane and generous treatment 
they everywhere experienced at the hands of Washington, 
and his compeers, settled for ever the question of their 
allegiance ; and, from the time when General Howe eva- 
cuated his short-lived possessions on and about the Dela- 
ware, there were no truer or more devoted supporters of 
the cause of independence in the States, than those of New 
Jersey. 

While affording every possible protection to the persons 
and property of American citizens, the principal officers, in 
their various stations, seemed constantly to vie with each 
other, in giving proofs of vigilance, enterprise, and valor, 
against the common foe. The numbers under the com- 
mand of each were necessarily very small. But they 
were always on the alert for opportunities to annoy the 
enemy, incessantly hovering, in small scouting parties, 
about their quarters, interrupting their communications, 
cutting off their supplies, surprising their foraging parties 
and pickets, and, in every other way, showing them that, 
though broken, they were not subdued. They maintained 
a constant communication with each other, and, by mutual 
counsel and assistance, and a perfect harmony of jopera- 



SKIRMISHING. 281 

tion, contrived, in a great measure, to remedy the evil ot 
scanty numbers, and scattered posts. 

Lord Cornwallis was in command of the British forces 
at New Brunswick. General Dickinson, of New Jersey, 
was stationed on the west side of Millstone river, not far 
from Somerset Court-House, and about ten miles from 
New Brunswick. On the opposite side'' of the river was 
a mill, in which was deposited a large quantity of flour. 
Tempted by such a booty, of which he was in no small 
need, Lord Cornwallis sent out a party, about the 25th of 
January, with wagons and horses, to seize the flour, and 
collect such forage as fell in their way. While engaged 
in this enterprise, General Dickinson fell upon them in a 
most spirited manner, and drove them back, with some 
loss, taking from them forty wagons, and upwards of a 
hundred valuable horses, with a considerable number of 
sheep and cattle, which they had collected on their march. 
The two parties were nearly equal in number. The 
bridge over the Millstone was in possession of the British, 
and defended by their field-pieces ; so that General Dickin- 
son, to accomplish his purpose, was compelled to break 
the ice, and cross the river in three feet of water. 

General Putnam was still more successful in several 
expeditions, undertaken by his orders, during this trying 
winter. In the course of January, Colonel Gurney and 
Major Davis were"3etached from his command, with such 
parties of militia as could be spared from the garrisons, to 
protect the citizens of Monmouth county from the preda- 
tory incursions of the royalists, to which they were much 
exposed. Several severe skirmishes took place, in which 
the British invariably were the sufferers, losing large num- 
bers of men, as well as horses and wagons. So well, in- 
deed, did they cover the country, for a season, as to induce 
many of the most respectable inhabitants to declare, that 



282 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM 

for the security of their persons, as well as the salvation 
of their property, they were wholly indebted to the spirited 
exertions, and well-conducted manoeuvres, of these two 
detachments. Nor was this the only service rendered by 
such parties. While they rescued the country from the 
tyranny and depredations of the tories, they encouraged the 
militia to come boldly out, and embody themselves for their 
own defence. 

On the expiration of their term of service, which hap- 
pened soon after, Putnam was compelled to part even 
with such valuable and efficient coadjutors as these. 
How reluctantly he parted with them, in the then reduced 
state of his forces, may be gathered from the following let- 
ter, dated 

" Princeton, February 5, 1777. 

" To MAJOR JOHN DAVIS, of the Third Battalion of Cum- 
berland County Militia. 

" SIR I am much obliged to you for your activity, 
vigor and diligence, since you have been under my com- 
mand. You will now march your men to Philadelphia, 
and there discharge them, returning into the store all the 
ammunitions, arms and accoutrements you received at that 
place. 

" I am, sir, your humble servant, 

" ISRAEL PUTNAM." 

Two weeks after this, having received information thai 
a considerable party of refugees, in the pay of the British 
commander, had taken post at Lawrence's Neck, and were 
proceeding to erect, some works of defence there, General 
Putnam despatched Colonel Nelson, of Brunswick, with 
one hundred and fifty men, with orders to surprise and 
take them prisoners. That able officer conducted the 
.affair with so much secresy and decision, that the entire 



MAJOR STOCKTON AND THE SKINNERS. 2S3 

party was secured, with their arms, and considerable 
booty. They were about sixty in number, and were com- 
manded by Major Stockton, having been detached, on this 
service, from the brigade of the celebrated General Cort- 
landt Skinner, a New Jersey royalist, who, with his corps 
of kindred spirits, had taken advantage of General Howe's 
gracious Proclamation of pardon, and given in their adhe- 
sion to the King. 

In a letter to the Council of Safety for Pennsylvania, 
dated at Princeton, February IS, 1777, General Putnam 
thus speaks of Nelson's success, and commends the good 
conduct of the party : 

" Yesterday evening, Colonel Nelson, with a hundred 
and fifty men, at Lawrence's Neck, attacked sixty men of 
Cortlandt Skinner's Brigade, commanded by the enemy's 
RENOWNED LAND-PIRATE, Major Richard Stockton, routed 
them, and took the whole prisoners. Among them the 
Major, a captain, and three subalterns, with seventy stands 
of arms. Fifty of the Bedford, Pennsylvania, Riflemen 
behaved like veterans" 

As has been already remarked, General Putnam was 
proverbially lenient to his prisoners, so much so as some- 
times to incur the censure of those who had not learned to 
make the proper distinction between an armed and an 
unarmed foe. In the case of Major Stockton, he exer- 
cised an unusual severity, sending him to Philadelphia in 
irons, and ordering him to be placed in strict confinement 
there. The particular reason for this severe treatment 
does not appear in any of the official documents of the day, 
so far as I have had opportunity to examine them. Ge- 
neral Washington, writing, on the 10th of March, to Ge- 
neral Gates, then in command at Philadelphia, says, " I 
am informed that General Putnam sent to Philadelphia in 
irons, Major Stockton, taken upon the Raritan, and that 



284 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

he continues in strict confinement. I think we ought to 
avoid putting in practice, what we have so loudly com- 
plained of, the cruel treatment of prisoners. I therefore 
desire, that, if there is a necessity for confinement, it may 
be made as easy and comfortable as possible to Major 
Stockton and his officers. This man, I believe, has been 
very active and mischievous, but we took him in arms, as 
an officer of the enemy, and by the rules of war, we are 
obliged to treat him as such, and not as a felon." 

General Cortlandt Skinner, and his corps, were so no- 
torious for their cruel depredations upon the property of 
American citizens, that his name became a familiar appel- 
lative for that class of land-pirates, from whom the coun- 
try suffered, if possible, more severely than from their 
British enemies, or even their mercenary German allies. 
The Yagers, the Cow-Boys, and the Skinners, were but' 
different names for the three grades of lawless banditti, 
that prowled about the precincts of the two armies, in 
quest only of plunder, and reckless of the means of obtain- 
ing it. The Yagers and the Cowboys plundered both par- 
ties alike, indifferent to whom the booty belonged, so that 
they could secure it for their own use. The Skinners, 
though Americans, plundered only their own countrymen, 
and served the British as the dastardly jackal serves the 
lion. They were mere patricides, who, for British gold, 
sold themselves to rob the houses and fields, and cut the 
throats, of their more patriotic neighbors and relatives. It 
was this that made them so peculiarly obnoxious to our 
people. And it was, probably, either on account of some 
peculiar acts of violence and outrage that he had commit- 
ted, or from some special danger to be apprehended from 
suffering him to go at large on his parole, that the humane. 
General Putnam distinguished him from ordinary prisoners 
by a close confinement. When General Lee was made a 
prisoner by the British, General Howe refused to receive 



MAJ. SMITH'S GALLANT ENTERPRISE. 285 

his parole, on the ground that he was a deserter from the 
British service, and should be treated rather as a traitor to 
his king, than as an ordinary American prisoner. If there 
was even a show of justice or reason in this case, it was 
surely no great stretch of the same general principle, to ac- 
cord to any of the Skinners, and especially to Major 
Stockton, the distinction of irons, and a guarded cell. 

Shortly after the capture of Stockton and his detach- 
ment, General Putnam received, from his scouts, intelli- 
gence of another party of foragers, sent out by Lord Corn- 
\valiis towards Bound Brook. Immediately detaching 
Major Smith, with a few riflemen, to hang on the rear of 
the party, and annoy them, till he should come up, he 
made his dispositions to follow, with all the little force at 
his command. Before he reached the ground, however, 
the gallant Major, eager to secure for himself the honors 
of the day, had laid an ambush, sprung upon and surprised 
the enemy, killed several of his horses, and driven him 
back, with the loss of several prisoners and sixteen bag- 
gage-wagons his own little band sustaining no injury in 
life or limb. 

A large accession of strength to the British army in 
Brunswick, which took place towards the latter end of 
February, induced General Washington to believe, that 
another movement towards the Delaware would soon be 
made, with a view to gaining possession of Philadelphia. 
He accordingly wrote to General Putnam, advising him of 
this reinforcement of the enemy, and directing -him to be 
ever on the alert, and prepared for any movement that 
might take place. In case it should appear that Phila- 
delphia was to be their object, Putnam was to cross the 
river at once, with such force as might be then at his dis- 
posal, assume the command of the militia, who might as- 
semble, secure all the boats on the west side of the Dela- 
ware, and adopt every other measure that he might deem 



286 LIFE Of GKNERAL PUTNAM. 

necessary, to facilitate the passage of the rest of the army, 
if circumstances should require them again to retire from 
the Jerseys ; the possession of which he, at the same time, 
resolved to contest, inch by inch. 

But Lord Cornwallis, notwithstanding his vastly supe- 
rior advantages, was in no haste to advance. The two 
armies retained their relative position some two months 
longer, undisturbed by any event of greater importance 
than an occasional skirmish between their foraging and 
scouting parties. 

General Putnam continued at his post in Princeton, un- 
til near the middle of May, when a more important ser- 
vice was assigned him, in the northern department. Dur- 
ing his command in New Jersey, a period of four winter 
months, he had, by his several parties, taken from the 
enemy nearly a thousand prisoners, and more than a hun- 
dred and twenty baggage wagons, besides a large amount 
of other valuable booty. At one time, about the first of 
February, in an enterprise, the details of which are not 
given, he took ninety-six wagons, laden with provisions, 
on their way to the British army.* At another, as above 
described, sixteen. In services of this kind, he was not 
excelled by any other officer in the American army. Dur- 
ing all this period, Major Aaron Burr was attached to his 
staff, and lived with him as a member of his family. This 
singularly gifted man, though not more deficient in ambi- 
tion than in gallantry and intrigue, wrote to a friend, on 
the 7th of March, from Princeton, remarking, that, as for 
promotion, he did not expect it, and hardly desired it ; 
and adding, as the only apparent reason for his content- 
ment, " I am at present quite happy in the esteem and 
entire confidence of my good old General."

THE British having just organized a considerable army in 
the north, for which it was important to open a free com- 
munication with their centre of operations in New York, 
the possession of the North River, and of the passes of the 
Highlands, became a matter of deep interest to both par- 
ties. Washington had always foreseen the necessity of 
holding these passes not only foi' commanding supplies 
from the interior of New York, and guarding the western 
frontier of New England, but for cutting off the commu- 
nication of the enemy with their loyal supporters in 



288 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Canada. On retiring into New Jersey, near the close of 
the previous year, he had stationed a considerable force at 
Peekskill, under the command of General Heath. It 
was only in an extreme exigency, when it became neces- 
sary to concentrate all his force upon the one object of 
driving the enemy from the Jerseys, that he withdrew a 
considerable portion of that force, for a brief season. 

The recent successful attempts of the enemy to destroy 
the stores collected at Peekskill, and at Danbury in Con- 
necticut, indicated not only a watchfulness in that direc- 
tion, but a purpose to force a passage that way for more 
extensive and important operations. In the former of 
these affairs, General McDougall-, under the most unfa- 
vorable circumstances, had gained for himself the praise 
of prudent generalship. In the latter, Arnold had shown 
the coolness, intrepidity, and energy, for which he was 
conspicuous ; and the veteran Wooster, in the seventieth 
year of his age, had exhibited a spirit, zeal, and bravery, 
worthy of the best days of his youth, in attacking the 
retiring foe, with a few raw, undisciplined troops, has- 
tily collected from the highways and hedges, and gallantly 
maintaining the conflict with vastly superior numbers, till 
he fell mortally wounded. 

About the middle of May, Generals Greene and Knox 
were directed to proceed to the Highlands, and examine 
the river and passes, in company with Generals McDou- 
gall, George Clinton, and Wayne. They were instructed to 
look to the state and condition of the forts in the High- 
lands especially Fort Montgomery and to view them, 
both with reference to the probability of an attack by 
water, and the practicability of approaching them by laud, 
and then to give such directions, as should appear to them 
necessary, for their greater security. Their attention was 
particularly directed to the pass through the Highlands, 



PLA-N OF DEFENCE. 289 

on the west side of the North River, lest the enemy should 
possess themselves of it by a coup de main, before a suffi- 
cient force could be assembled to oppose them. 

Having faithfully discharged the duty assigned them, 
these officers made report to General Washington, recom- 
mending that the obstruction across the river at Fort 
Montgomery, which had already been proposed, should be 
completed. This was to be done by a boom, or chain, 
from bank to bank, in front of which should be one or two 
cables, to break the force of a vessel, before she should 
strike the chain. Two ships, and two row-galleys, were 
to be manned, and stationed just above this boom, in such 
a position as to fire advantageously upon the enemy's ships 
when they approached. This force, with the land batte- 
ries on the margins of the river, they supposed amply 
sufficient to defeat any efforts of the enemy to ascend by 
water. And on this they deemed it safe to rely, for the 
entire defence of this important pass ; remarking with 
confidence, that, " if the obstructions of the river could be 
rendered effective, the enemy would not attempt to operate 
by land the passes through the Highlands being so ex- 
ceedingly difficult." The result proved that this confi- 
dence was not well grounded, as fort Montgomery was 
afterwards assaulted and taken by a party, which pene- 
trated the defiles of the Highlands on the west side of the 
river. 

Arnold, who had been strangely, and, in the view of 
Washington, unjustly overlooked, in the recent promotions 
by Congress, had just received his commission as Major- 
General. But its date, being subsequent to those of five 
others who had been his juniors in rank, still left him 
subordinate to those whom he had once commanded. To 
make amends as far as he could, for this singular treat- 
ment, Washington offered him the command on the North 
S 



290 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

River; which, at that juncture, was as honorable a post 
as any officer in the army could hold. But his private 
affairs calling him to Philadelphia, the place was assigned 
to General Putnam. He was instructed to use every 
means in his power for expediting and effecting the works 
and obstructions mentioned in the report above referred to. 
His attention was particularly directed to fixing the boom. 
This work, which was completed only with great labor 
and difficulty, was well suited to the ingenuity and indus- 
try of Putnam ; and no man in the service could have 
been better chosen to superintend and direct such a plan. 
To support the weight of the chain, it was necessary to 
place under it large rafts of timber, at small distances from 
each other. These, together with the chain itself, pre- 
sented such obstructions to the descending current, as to 
raise the water several feet, by which its force was so 
much increased, that the chain was broken. It was soon 
replaced, and the recurrence of a similar accident prevent- 
ed, by several of the largest sized cables being passed 
round the lower side of the rafts, and made fast on either 
shore. Some idea may be formed of the extent and 
difficulty of this undertaking, when it is stated, that the 
width of the river, at this place, is five hundred and forty 
yards, and that, being laid diagonally, the better to resist 
the current, the cables required for the service were not 
less than four hundred and fifty fathoms in length.* 

These works were well and faithfully executed under 
the able guidance of General Putnam ; and it is not im- 
probable, that the arduous labor performed here, connect- 
ed with the constant exposure of his person, in and about 

* A letter from an officer in the royal army, that removed the chain, 
dated Oct. 7, 1777, and published in the Pennsylvania Ledger of that 
year, describes the chain as near a mile in length, each link weigh- 
ing sixty pounds.

the water, may have been the principal means of under- 
mining his health, and subjecting his iron constitution to 
the peculiar infirmity, by which, in a little more than two 
years after, he was compelled, in the vigor of an otherwise 
green old age, to retire from the field. 

On his appointment to this station, the Commander-in- 
chief addressed a letter to Brigadier-General McDoagall,

who had previously held the command there, in which he 
state;:, in a few words, some of the prominent traits in his 
character, as a man, and shows how truly that character 
was appreciated by one who had had the best possible 
means of proving it, under some of the most trying circum- 
stances to which it could have been exposed. " I have 
ordered General Putnam to Peekskill. You are well 
acquainted with the old gentleman's temper ; he is active, 
disinterested, and open to conviction, and I, therefore, 
hope that, by affording him the advice and assistance 
which your knowledge of the post enables you to do, .you 
will be very happy in your command under him." 

To Brigadier-General Parsons he wrote, about the same 

C> ' 

time, as follows : " As I consider* the defence of the forti. 
fications and passes through the Highlands an object of 
the last importance, and possessing them most probably to 
form the chief end of the enemy's councils and immediate 
operations, I wish you to come to Peekskill, and there 
continue with the troops, till some further disposition shall 
become necessary." And again, on the 29th : " The 
passes and fortifications in the Highlands are of the last 
importance, and every means in our power must be em- 
ployed to secure them." The. troops at this post were 
chiefly those from New England and New York. 

But it was not in raising fortifications alone, or in plan- 
ning and completing obstructions to the navigation of the 
river, that the talents of this tried soldier and able com

mander were expected to be employed. The following 
letter shows that he was still relied upon, as an accom- 
plished general, to order and execute important and deli- 
cate movements against the enemy. 

" To MAJOR-GENERAL PUTNAM. 

" Morristown, 25 May, 1777. 
"DEAR SIR : 

" Would it be practicable, do you think, under the 
present circumstances and situation of the troops at Peeks- 
kill, to surprise the enemy at King's Bridge ? It must be 
effected by surprise, or not at all ; and must be undertaken 
by water which would also prove abortive, if the enemy 
have vessels of any kind above Fort Washington. The 
undigested ideas which I have entertained of the matter 
are these : to embark a number of troops, supposed ade- 
quate to the enterprise, in boats, under pretenCe of trans- 
porting them and their baggage to Tappan, as a more easy 
and expeditious method of joining the army under my 
immediate command. To cover this the better, a number 
^f wagons might be ordered to assemble at the landing on 
this side, in order to receive your baggage. Or, if it 
should be thought that moving a body of men so near the 
enemy would put them too much on their guard, could 
not the troops be embarked at Peekskill, under pretence 
of reinforcing the garrison on the river, in order to expe- 
dite the works, and actually set off as if bound thither ; 
but, under cover of darkness, turn and push down the 
river ? But here, possibly, a difficulty will arise on 
account of the impracticability of getting down in the 
night, and the difficulty of being concealed, in any creek or 
inlet on the western shore in the day. These are all mat- 
ters worthy of consideration, and I have nothing more in 
view than to lead you into a train of thinking upon the 



PROJECTED ENTERPRISE. 293 

subject. Let the matter be communicated to Generals 
McDougall and George Clinton for their sentiments, but 
under strong injunctions of secresy ; for it always happens, 
that, where more than two or three^ are apprized of an 
undertaking of this kind, the knowledge of it gets abroad, 
which must immediately defeat any measure that depends 
upon secresy. 

" The place at which I should propose your landing 
would be in the hollow between Fort Washington and 
Spiten Devil. It is a good landing place, and affords a 
good passage into the road leading from Fort Washington 
to the Bridge. It is very obscure, and would enable you 
to fall in upon the back of the troops at Fort Independence, 
by which the surprise would be greater, and their retreat 
cut off. Thence your troops might, or might not,* march 
up by land, and sweep the country before them of the 
enemy and provisions, as circumstances would justify. 
After consulting the gentlemen before mentioned on the 
propriety of this measure, let me know the result, by a 
careful person, and when the plan could be conveniently 
carried into execution. 

" I am, dear Sir, 

" Your most affectionate, &c., 
"GEO. WASHINGTON." 

Three days after the date of this letter, General Wash- 
ington removed his camp from Morristown to Middlebrook, 
and the subsequent movements of General Howe requiring 
his utmost watchfulness and activity, the plan of surprising 
his outposts was, for the time, abandoned. There was 
no officer in the army, who would have performed a ser- 
vice of this kind with more alacrity or effect than General 
Putnam. His successes in the previous campaign in New 
Jersey fully demonstrated that he had lost none of the 



294 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

energy, promptness and skill, which had distinguished his 
partizan adventures in the Seven Years' War. 

It was not until the 10th of June that the British army, 
under the immediate command of Sir William Howe, left 
its quarters at Brunswick. For a considerable time, the 
movements of that commander were so uncertain and inex- 
plicable, as greatly to puzzle and perplex his sagacious 
antagonist ; for, while it was necessary for him to watch 
every point, it was still more so, that he should be at hand 
to meet the blow whenever it should be struck. The pre- 
servation of Philadelphia and the Highlands were objects 
of equal importance and interest. The former appearing 
to be the first aim of the British commander, General 
Washington prepared to gather all his scattered forces 
about him, to contest the passage through the Jerseys. 
To this end, General Putnam was ordered on the 12th of 
June, to send forward Generals Parsons, McDougall, and 
Glover, with all the Continental troops, at Peekskill, ex- 
cept one thousand effective men ; which number, in con- 
nection with the militia and convalescent at that post, was 
deemed equal to the number of the enemy then on the 
east side of the Hudson. The above detachments were 
ordered to march in three divisions, each to follow one 
day's march behind the other, and each of the first two 
divisions to be attended by two pieces of artillery. 

A few days after this, while these orders were in the 
course of execution, intelligence was received, through a 
Canadian spy, of the probable advance of General Bur- 
goyne from that quarter. To provide against this event, 
General Putnam was ordered still further to reduce his 
effective force, by holding four regiments of Massachusetts 
militia in readiness to go up the river at a moment's warn- 
ing. He was also directed to order a sufficient number of 
sloops from Albany, to serve as transports for the troops. 



DANGER ON THE NORTH. 295 

Ever on the watch for any intelligence, which might 
indicate the real designs of the enemy, General Putnam 
was enabled, on the 30th of June, to transmit to his Com- 
mander papers of great importance, in consequence of 
which a new disposition was made of the American forces, 
and Putnam, anticipating the wishes of Washington, put a 
portion of his own command in readiness to meet the exi- 
gency. In reply to this communication, Washington 
wrote, under date of July 1st, "The intelligence, con- 
tained in the copies of the letters you transmitted, is truly 
important. It appears almost certain to me, that General 
Howe and Genera] Burgoyne design, if possible, to unite 
their attack, and form a junction of their two armies. I 
approve much of your conduct, in ordering Nixon's bri- 
gade to be in readiness, and I desire that it may be em- 
barked immediately, with baggage, to go for Albany, as 
soon as General Varnum's and General Parsons' brigades 
are so near Peekskill, that they can arrive to supply their 
place, before any troops can come up the river, and effect 
a landing, or as soon as a number of militia, equal to them, 
can be got in. It seems absolutely necessary for you to 
pursue the most speedy and effectual measures, to obtain 
a respectable reinforcement of the neighboring militia. No 
time is to be lost. Much may be at stake ; and I am per- 
suaded, if General Howe is going up the river, he will 
make a rapid and vigorous push to gain the Highland 
passes. You will not think of sending Glover's brigade 
to White Plains in the present situation of affairs." 

Thus it continued during a considerable part of this per- 
plexing season. Time was consumed, and strength and 
patience were tried, in marches and countermarches, 
which resulted in nothing but weariness. Before one 
order was fully executed, it was countermanded by ano- 
ther of an opposite character. Before the last of the three 



296 LITE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

divisions ordered from Peekskill was ready to leave that 
post, the demand for its removal was recalled, and one of 
the others was on its return, in company with a fresh bri- 
gade, to reinforce the garrison, now regarded as the post of 
peculiar danger. General Clinton was, at the same time, 
urgently requested, without loss of time, to call out a con- 
siderable body of the New York militia, from the neigh- 
boring counties of Orange and Ulster, to support General 
Putnam, while the latter called upon those of Connecti- 
cut, to swell the reinforcement. 

To meet these rapidly shifting movements, and exe- 
cute skilfully these continually conflicting orders, in con- 
nection with the other arduous duties of his station, de- 
manded a degree of activity, industry and talent, scarcely 
inferior to that of the Commander-in-chief, and a spirit 
and energy not always to be found in men of three score 
years. 

But though the labors of the season were exceedingly 
arduous, and the perils of war imminent and incessant, 
there was occasional opportunity even with the soldier, 
for pastime. And Putnam, with his wonted good humor, 
seized every opening that would justify a little recreation 
for himself and his men. A fine opportunity was offered 
on the first anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, 
and liberal arrangements were made to improve it. It 
was celebrated with feast and song, and feu de joie 
with eloquent speeches and patriotic toasts, in which suc- 
cess to the blessed cause of liberty, and confusion to all its 
enemies, were pledged as heartily and truly as they have 
ever been by their successors. The concluding scene of 
that day's sport was peculiar and emphatic. On the top 
of one of the rugged eminences that overhang the Hudson, 
in the vicinity of his post, Putnam had discovered an im- 
mense rock, of several hundred tons weight, so perfectly 



FOURTH OF JULT. 297 

poised in its rest, that a comparatively small power, well 
applied, would destroy its balance, and send it thundering 
down into the dark ravine below. 

Having made his preparations, he drew up a handsome 
detachment of his force upon the height, accompanied by 
his principal officers, in full uniform, when, after an ani- 
mated and amusing address, he gave orders for the lever 
to be manned. The mighty mass trembled and quivered, 
and fell with a tremendous crash, accompanied by a simul- 
taneous discharge from the whole corps, and immediately 
followed by the thunder of the artillery and heavy guns in 
forts, whose echoes bellowed and reverberated a long time 
from the heights and cliffs around. As the huge rock 
toppled from its old resting place, one party of the officers 
on one side of it, shouted in admirable unison " So may 
the thrones of tyrants fall !" And when it settled into its 
new bed below, the other responded " So may the ene- 
mies of freedom sink to rise no more !" 

The danger from the north becoming more imminent, 
by the evacuation of Ticonderoga and its dependencies, 
and the consequent advance of Burgoyne to the vicinity 
of the Hudson, Putnam was ordered to furnish General 
Schuyler with still further aid, including ten pieces of 
artillery, with the proper officers to direct in their use, 
and a considerable quantity of powder and ball. 

The following order to his aide-de-camp, Major Burr, 
appears under date of the 14th July: 

" Pursuant to orders from his Excellency, General 
Washington, you are forthwith to repair to Norwalk, Fair- 
field, and other places, adjacent on the Sound, and to 
transmit to me intelligence of the movements of the 
enemy. On your return you will pass through Litchfield, 
and leave orders for all detachments of any regiments

of Nixon's brigade, to take the most direct route to Al- 

O / 

bany. 

"ISRAEL PUTNAM." 

In the meantime, General Washington, with the army 
under his command, was gradually moving up towards the 
Highlands, on the western side of the Hudson, and, by 
the middle of July, had advanced, by way of Pompton 
Plains, as far as the Clove, a narrow passage leading 
through the mountains, about eighteen miles from the 
river near the entrance of which he fixed his camp. 
From this place, General Sullivan and Lord Stirling, with 
their divisions, were successively sent across the river, to 
swell the already formidable force of General Putnam, the 
main body being held in reserve, to operate on either shore, 
as the movements of the enemy should require. 

Having, on the 20th, in consequence of information, 
which proved to be premature, advanced eleven miles 
within the Clove, General Washington addressed an ear- 
nest letter to Putnam, requesting the mos-t accurate and 
detailed account of the movements and designs of the 
enemy, both by sea and by land, his present position being 
in the highest degree embarrassing and perilous. Putnam 
had, in the meantime, despatched General Sullivan, and 
other trusty and intelligent persons, to various points of 
the river, and the coast, to obtain such intelligence as could 
be safely relied on. Having by this means ascertained, 
beyond a doubt, that the British fleet, with a large num- 
ber of troops on board, had passed the Hook, and put out 
to sea, the army returned into New Jersey, and prepared 
to oppose, with all its force, the meditated movement upon 
Philadelphia. General Sullivan, and Lord Stirling, with 
their divisions, were immediately detached by General 
Putnam, in the same direction, accompanied by all the 



HOWE'S ILL-MANAGED RUSE. 299 

field-pieces at Peekskill, except two pieces for each bri- 
gade that remained for the defence of that post. 

The next day, he received orders to " keep as many of 
his remaining troops, as could possibly be spared from the 
defence of the forts and passes of the Highlands, in the 
most perfect readiness to move, either to the southward or 
to the eastward, as occasion should require. I do not pre- 
tend," continued the letter, " to fix upon the number 
which may be necessary for those defences. You and 
your officers must determine this point, proportioning your 
defence to the troops left by General Howe on York Island. 
If you have not already done it, let the eastern States be 
immediately advised of the fleet's sailing from the Hook, 
that they may be in a posture of defence, as no person can 
with certainty say where the blow will be struck." 

At this critical juncture, an attempt was made to blind 
the eyes of Washington as to the real movements of the 
enemy. A young American, who had been a prisoner in 
New York, was employed to convey a letter from General 
Howe to General Burgoyne, with the apparent design of 
notifying the latter of the intended movements of the for- 
mer. The messenger whether in obedience to his instruc- 
tions, or not, does not appear, but certainly in accordance 
with the wishes of the writer immediately hastened to 
Peekskill, and delivered up the letter to General Putnam, 
by whom, after perusal, it was communicated to the Com- 
mander-in-chief. It was in the handwriting of General 
Howe, and read as follows : 

" New York, 20 July, 1777. 
"DEAR SIR, 

u I have received your letter of the 14th of May from 
Quebec, and shall fully observe its contents. The expe- 
dition to B n [Boston] will take the place of that up 



300 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

the North River. If, according to my expectations, we 
may succeed rapidly in the possession of B., the enemy 
having no force of consequence there, I shall, without loss 
of time, proceed to cooperate with you in the defeat of the 
rebel army opposed to you. Clinton is sufficiently strong to 
amuse Washington and Putnam. I am now making de- 
monstrations to the southward, which I think will have the 
full effect in carrying our plan into execution. Success 
attend you. 

"W. HOWE." 

It was a clumsy plan, and clumsily executed ; and pro- 
duced no other impression on the mind either of Wash- 
ington or Putnam, than to establish, beyond a doubt, the 
design upon Philadelphia, and hasten the march of the 
forces in that direction. 

Notwithstanding this decisive movement, and the con- 
centrated interest which it created towards the capital of 
Pennsylvania, the posts in the Highlands were still deemed 
so important, and the necessity of the possession of them 
by the British, in order to a junction of their two armies, 
seemed so manifest and urgent, that Washington, to use 
his own expression, " could not help casting his eyes con- 
tinually behind him." That they might not be left too 
much exposed, General Sullivan's division was ordered to 
halt at Morristown, and be in readiness to return, at a mo- 
ment's warning, if necessary. 

On the arrival of the enemy's fleet at the Cape of Dela- 
ware, General Putnam was directed to send forward two 
other brigades, which he had already, in anticipation of 
the demand, transported across the river, and put in readi- 
ness for instant departure. The deficiency thus created in 
his own garrison, now reduced to two thousand Continen- 
tal troops, he was requested, if possible, to supply by im-

mediate requisitions upon the militia of Connecticut and 
New York. 

The very next day, August 1st, in consequence of a 
new ruse on the part of the enemy's fleet, all these orders 
were countermanded, and General Sullivan's division, 
with the two brigades on the western bank of the Hudson, 
were directed immediately to return and recross the river, 
while the main body of the army prepared to follow with 
all possible expedition. Says Washington, in his letter to 
General Putnam, on this occasion, " The importance of 
preventing General Howe's getting possession of the High- 
lands by a coup-de-main, is infinite to America ; and, in the 
present situation of things, every effort that can be thought 
of, must be used." 

By this continual marching and countermarching, in the 
hottest season of the year, the American troops were more 
harassed, than by all the fatigues and duties of the cam- 
paign, and many of them became so discouraged and dis- 
gusted with the service, as to embrace every opportunity 
to desert. 

On the third of August, Sir Henry Clinton, who had 
recently returned from England, and now commanded the 
British forces in the City of New York, sent up a flag of 
truce to General Putnam, at Peekskill. Edmund Palmer, 
a lieutenant in a regiment of American Tories, had been 
detected in the American camp, in disguise as a spy, and 
the object of the flag was to claim him as an officer in the 
British service. The message, accompanying it, expati- 
ated upon the heinous crime of bringing to an ignominious 
death, by execution, a man bearing his Majesty's commis- 
sion, and threatened signal vengeance, in case of such a 
violation of his person. The flag was taken up the river 
to Verplank's Point, by Captain Montagu, in the ship 
Mercury, and thence forwarded to the camp. General 



302 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Putnam instantly returned the following characteristic 
reply : 

" Head Quarters, 7 August, 1777. 

" Edmund Palmer, an officer in the enemy's service, 
was taken as a spy, lurking within our lines ; he has been 
tried as a spy, condemned as a spy, and shall be executed 
as a spy, and the flag is ordered to depart immediately. 

"ISRAEL PUTNAM. 
" P. S. He has accordingly been executed." 

In the meantime, Burgoyne was advancing on the north, 
and the army in that quarter stood greatly in need of rein- 
forcements. General Putnam's post at Peekskill was the 
only one from which such aid could be immediately sent 
Washington, addressing him on the subject, on the 7th of 
August, remarks, " I would not wish to weaken you, as 
the enemy seem to bend their course again towards you. 
I desire that you, and the general officers, would consider 
the matter fully, and, if you think that you can spare Cort- 
landt's and Livingston's regiments, they may be put in 
readiness to move." He also recommended highly the 
plan, in which Putnam was engaged, of fortifying, by va- 
rious works of defence, the entrance to the passes in the 
vicinity of his post.

SIR HENRY CLINTON'S object in sending the unfortunate 
Lieutenant Palmer into Putnam's camp, was to obtain 
accurate knowledge of the condition of that post, and the 
force stationed there, with a view to turning his arms 
against it. This General Washington fully expected, and, 
accordingly, wrote to General Putnam, on the llth of 
August, as follows : " If General Clinton is left upon York 
Island, with the number of men you mention, it is probably 
to attack you below, while Burgoyne comes down upon 
you. It is a matter of great consequence to ascertain that 
fact. I beg you will use every method to come at the 



304 LIFE OP GENERAL PUTNAM. 

knowledge of his force." This duty Putnam faithfully 
fulfilled, and obtained, by means of his spies, -accurate 
information respecting the strength of the garrison in New 
York ; which he intended, if Providence should favor his 
plans, soon to turn to good account. 

General Putnam's command embraced the fortified posts 
in the Highlands, on both sides of the river. His head- 
quarters were at Peekskill, on the eastern side. Forts 
Montgomery and- Clinton were situated on the western 
side the former in the township of Cornwall, the latter in 
Monroe being separated from each other by Poplopen 
Kill, a narrow stream, which runs down from the moun- 
tains in their rear. These forts were placed on very high 
ground, so that they could not be safely stormed in front ; 
and, being deemed as was stated in the report of Generals 
Knox and Greene inaccessible in the rear, were con- 
sidered, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, impregna- 
ble.* They were garrisoned chiefly by the militia of 
New York, who, to the number of about six hundred, 
were then under the immediate command of General 
George Clinton, Governor of the State ; of whom General 
Washington remarked, in reference to his command at 
this post : " There cannot be a more proper man upon 
every account." 

Fort Independence was just under Anthony's Nose, 
about three miles below forts Montgomery and Clinton, 
and on the opposite side of the river. It was situated on 
a high point of land, in the town of Cortland, Westchester 
County. Fort Constitution was rather more than six miles 

* The mountains which commence five or six miles below these 
forts, are so high and rugged, the denies, through which the roads 
leading to them pass, so narrow, and so commanded by the heights 
on both sides, that the approaches to them are exceedingly difficult 
and dangerous. MARSHALL. 



DESIGNS UPON THE BRITISH POSTS. 305 

above them, on an island, near the eastern shore. Peeks- 
kill Village, the general Head-Quarters of the officer com- 
manding at the station, was about two miles below Fort 
Independence, with a considerable creek, or inlet, between 
them, into which two respectable streams flowed from the 
north and east. The latter, being Peeks' Kill, gives its 
name to the village, which is included in the town of 
Cortland. Continental Village, where most of the stores 
were deposited, was situated on high ground, in the rear 
of Fort Independence, and about two miles north of Peeks- 
kill, on the road to Fort Constitution. It was a military 
settlement only its population being made up of those 
artizans, mechanics, and other laborers, who were employ- 
ed about the various works connected with the army. 

Having a very respectable force under his command, 
and being encouraged by Governor Trumbull to expect 
large reinforcements of militia from Connecticut, for that 
purpose, General Putnam formed a plan for a very impor- 
tant blow upon the enemy's posts. He had informed him- 
self accurately of their force, and the condition of their 
defences at Staten Island, Paulus Hook (Jersey City), 
York Island, and Long Island, and was making his arrange- 
ments for a simultaneous assault upon all these posts. 
Extensive preparations were making for carrying this plan 
into executi&n. In the view of his counsellors, who were 
able and judicious men, the position of the enemy justified 
the attempt. Success, which was probable, would be 
attended with the happiest consequences, by wrenching 
from the enemy all that he had hitherto gained, and get- 
ting possession of an immense amount of valuable stores 
of every description. This plan, which was formed early 
in September, was in very promising progress, when the 
demands for reinforcements to the main army became so 
urgent, that it was necessary to abandon it for a season 



306 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

About a month later, a similar attempt, upon a smaller 
scale, was suggested to Putnam, by the Commander-in- 
chief, and a movement in that direction was made, the 
details of which will be given in its appropriate place. 

General Sullivan's division was held in media, at Mor- 
ristown, till the British fleet returned into the Chesapeake. 
They were then ordered to join the main army on the 
Delaware. General McDougall was also immediately 
ordered down from Peekskill, as well as General Dickinson 
from New Jersey. 

The State of New Jersey becoming defenceless by the 
withdrawal of the main army to Pennsylvania, Sir Henry 
Clinton seized that opportunity for effecting an incursion 
into the country. His troops landed, in four divisions at 
Elizabethtown Point, Schuyler's Landing on the Hacken- 
sack River, Fort Lee, and Tappan approaching, at this 
last point, the vicinity of General Putnam. The object was 
to drive off the cattle, and to attack any small party of 
the enemy that might be met with ; as it was known that, 
in the divided state of the American army, no force of 
much magnitude could at this time be in Jersey. The 
number of troops engaged in the enterprise amounted to 
more than two thousand. 

Colonel Malcom's regiment, then stationed at Ramapo, 
just below the entrance of the Clove, watched their mo- 
tions, but was not in force to offer much resistance. A 
party of that regiment, under command of Lieutenant- 
Colonel Burr, who had just been promoted to that rank, 
and who was eager to be engaged in some active enterprise, 
was sent down to collect intelligence, and to prevent the 
ravages of the enemy's small detachments. There was 
also some skirmishing with the militia of the several 
places through which they passed. Th-- enemy lost, in 
this way, eight killed, and eighteen wounded ; and, accord-

ing to the account of their own commander, seventeen 
were taken prisoners. 

As soon as General Putnam received intelligence of this 

O 

movement, he ordered General McDougall to cross the 
river, with fifteen hundred men, and advance to meet 
them. The order was obeyed, but not in time to overtake 
the enemy, who were already retiring with their booty. 

This incursion caused great alarm in New Jersey, and 
rendered it necessary for General Dickinson to leave be- 
hind him one thousand of the militia, who were intended 
to reinforce the army of Washington ; while it occasioned 
some delay, on the part of Putnam, in forwarding the 
detachments ordered from Peekskill the necessity of 
meeting and resisting the hostile movements of the enemy 
in his own immediate vicinity, being supposed paramount 
to any order from his superior, issued in ignorance of those 
movements. 

The situation of the main army on the Delaware being 
critical in the extreme, a further order upon General Put- 
nam was issued, on the 23d of September, requiring from 
him a further detachment of sixteen hundred men, under 
General Varnum. This was to include the regiment of 
Colonel Malcom, which had been posted in the Clove, to 
guard the passes to the forts on the west bank of the river. 
In consequence of the previous delay in forwarding the 
expected reinforcements, Washington concludes his letter 
thus : " That you may not hesitate about complying with 
this order, you are to consider it peremptory, and not to 
be dispensed with." Putnam was, at the same time, 
required, for the protection of his own post, and the passes 
in the Highlands, to call in all his outposts, and, if threat- 
ened with an attack, to get what aid he could from the 
militia. 

These orders being obeyed, General Putnam's force 



308 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

was reduced to fifteen hundred three hundred of whom 
were militia, on whom no dependence could be placed. 
Many oftho.se who had been sent in to reinforce this post, 
had deserted, and others became so restive and uneasy 
that the General, who well knew of how little value they 
\vould be to the service, if compelled to remain against 
their will, suffered them to depart. The three hundred 
who remained, were but little better than men of straw. 
They would answer to count, when it was necessary to 
make a fair show of numbers ; but could not be counted 
upon, in the hour of danger. 

Knowing what heavy drafts had been made upon the 
Highland fortresses, and having himself received conside- 
rable reinforcements from Europe, Sir Henry Clinton 
resolved to avail himself of the opportunity to attack them 
with the flower of his force, and thus, if possible, break 
a way through to the assistance of Burgoyne. He had an 
eye also, in this expedition, to the extensive and valuable 
military stores collected in the Highlands. Accordingly, 
with a force of between three and four thousand men, he 
sailed up the North River, and made his appearance on 
the 5th of October, in Tarrytown Bay. 

Everything combined to favor the movement of the 
British in this case. The forces of the Americans, which 
were not more than half those of the enemy, were neces- 
sarily divided between four points two on each side of 
the river, and separated miles from each other. All of 
these must be guarded alike the most important, as well 
as the most exposed, being those on the east side, which 
covered the military stores and provisions for the army. 
While, therefore, it was incumbent on Putnam to have his 
pye upon all these points at once, with a view to adapt 
his defence to the attack, Clinton fixed his attention upon 
one only, and concentrated his whole force upon that

only making such demonstrations towards the opposite 
side, as to mask his real designs. This is ever the advan- 
tage of him who takes the offensive attitude ; that, by a 
well managed feint, he can withdraw the strength of his 
enemy from the post where he intends to strike his deci- 
sive blow. By this means, General Clinton succeeded, 
on this occasion being remarkably favored in the opera- 
tion by a heavy fog, which hung over the river, and con- 
cealed the greater part of his movements from the view of 
his adversary. 

After some manoeuvring in the bay, he landed his 
whole force at Tarrytown, whence he marched about five 
miles up the country, with no other object but to mislead 
and divert his enemy, and then returned at night to the 
landing. Embarking again the next morning, he proceed- 
ed up the river to King's Ferry, and made another landing 
at Verplanck's Point, about three miles below Peekskill ; 
upon which General Putnam retired to the fortified heights 
in his rear, covering the Continental Village. In the even- 
ing of the same day, a part of these troops re-embarked, 
and the fleet moved up to Peekskill Neck, in order to 
mask their movements at King's Ferry, which was below 
them. The next morning, at break of day, large detach- 
ments of more than two thousand men, destined for an 
enterprise against the fortifications on the western side, 
landed at Stony Point, just opposite to Verplanck's Point, 
and commenced their march through the mountains, into 
the rear of Forts Clinton and Montgomery. This disem- 
barkation was observed on the other side, but the state of 
the atmosphere was such that no estimate could be formed 
of its numbers. A larsre fire which was soon afterwards 

O 

perceived at the landing place, led to the belief that it^was 
only a small party, detached for the purpose of destroying 
the store-houses on that side. The manoeuvres of the 



310 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

vessels confirmed this suspicion ; and the troops remaining 
at Verplanck's Point, whose numbers, though they could 
not be correctly ascertained^were nearly if not quite equal 
to his own, fully satisfied General Putnam that the medi 
tated attack was to be directed against Fort Independence. 
His whole attention was, accordingly, turned that way, 
and every preparation was immediately made for a resolute 
defence. 

The enemy remaining quiet at Verplanck's Point, and 
Putnam not being able to gain from his pickets and scouts 
any satisfactory report of their numbers or apparent designs, 
he went down, in company with Brigadier-General Par- 
sons, and Adjutant-General Root, to reconnoitre their posi- 
tion in person. 

In the meantime, the detachments which had landed at 
Stony Point in the morning, were pursuing their march 
towards the rear of the mountain fortresses. Long before 
the fog had cleared away from the bank, they were lost 
to the view of those who were eagerly watching for them 
on the other side, and who now supposed they had return- 
ed to the ships, having accomplished their object of burn- 
ing the storehouses. Avoiding the Clove, which they 
supposed too well defended to be forced, they filed off to 
the west, and passing to the rear of Dunderberg, began to 
climb the rugged and difficult passes toward Fort Clinton. 
Leaving a battalion at the pass of Dunderberg, to protect 
his rear, and keep open the communication with the river, 
Sir Henry Clinton formed his army into two divisions. 
One, consisting of nine hundred men, commanded by 
Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell, made a circuit by the forest 
of Deane, in the rear of Bear's Hill, in order to fall on the 
back of Fort Montgomery. The other, consisting of twelve 
hundred men, commanded by General Vaughan, and ac- 
companied by Sir Henry Clinton in person, advanced 



THE WESTERN FORTS ATTACKED 311 

slowly towards Fort Clinton, intending so to time their 
movements, as to make their attacks simultaneously upon 
both fortresses. 

General George Clinton, apprehending from the move- 
ments below, that an attack on his position was intended, 
had despatched Major Logan, on the evening of Sunday, 
the 5th, to gain intelligence. He returned on Monday 
morning, and reported the landing of a considerable body 
of troops at the Point, but so dense was the fog, that he 
was not able to form any judgment of their numbers. 
Lieutenant Jackson was immediately despatched with a 
small party, on the Haverstravv road, to watch their mo- 
tions. He had not proceeded more than two miles, when 
he was attacked by a party in ambuscade, at a place called 
Doodletown. Returning their fire with spirit, he fell back 
toward the fort. As soon as the firing was heard, a hun- 
dred men were ordered out to sustain him. They were 
all soon engaged in a brisk retreating skirmish with the 
superior numbers of the enemy, disputing their advance 
inch by inch, though too weak entirely to repulse them. 
Their gallant opposition, and the roughness of the ground, 
checked the progress of the enemy for a considerable 
time. 

Meanwhile, the party under Lieutenant-Colonel Camp- 
bell was advancing, through the forest road, to the rear of 
Fort Montgomery. A party of one hundred and twenty 
men, accompanied by a single field-piece, which was all 
the artillery in the fort, was ordered out to meet them, in 
the hope of being able to hold them in check, until a rein- 
forcement, which had been sent for, should arrive fiom 
Peekskill. From the advantageous position of this little 
party, they were enabled to do immense execution upon 
the enemy, who were several times driven back in his 
desperate attempts to gain the pass. At length, filing oft" 



312 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

through the woods, upon the right and left, they were 
about to surround the Spartan band, when, perceiving their 
danger, they made good their retreat to the fort. 

It was now about two o'clock in the afternoon ; and the 
enemy, in full force, approached the works, and began a 
furious assault, which continued about three hours. At 
five o'clock, a flag was sent up, to demand a surrender, in 
order to prevent the further effusion of blood. A spirited 
refusal was returned, and the attack was renewed. The 
defence was ably sustained until the dusk of the evening, 
when the enemy, by the superiority of their numbers, 
forced the works on all sides, the garrison being too small 
to man the lines in their whole extent. 

Through the treachery of the messenger, who had beeu 
despatched early in the day, to solicit a reinforcement from 
General Putnam, the message did not reach that officer ; 
and he was wholly unacquainted with the movements of 
the enemy on the western side of the river, and the peri- 
lous exposure of his friends there, until it was announced 
by the report of musketry and cannon in the first onset. He 
was then on his return from Verplanck's Point, whither he 
had gone, in person, as before stated, to obtain certain intel- 
ligence of the numbers and position of the enemy. He 
hastened back with all speed, to order a suitable detach- 
ment to their support. In this he was partially anticipated 
by the promptness and decision of his Aid, Major Hum- 
phreys, who, being alone at Head Quarters when the 
firing commenced,. hastened to Colonel Wyllys, then the 
senior officer in camp, and earnestly advised him, without 
waiting for orders from the General, to despatch all the 
men not on. duty to Fort Montgomery. Five hundred 
men were instantly ordered on this service, under the com- 
mand of the gallant Colonel Meigs, and were ready to 
march whei General Putnam arrived. They were hur-

ried forward with all possible despatch, having five or six 
miles to march to the place of debarkation. But it was 
too late. Major Humphreys, in company with Dr. Beards- 
ley, a surgeon in his brigade, rode at full speed through a 
by-path to the river, to give notice to the garrison that a 
reinforcement was on its march. But, notwithstanding all 
their exertions, they did not reach the fort, till it was so 
completely invested, that it was impossible to enter ; and 
they had the misfortune to be idle, though not unconcerned 
spectators or the storm. 

The works being carried, General Clinton, with a con- 
siderable number of his officers and men, who were well 
acquainted with the ground, were so fortunate as to effect 
their escape, under cover of the night, and to reach the 
other side of the river, where they found the reinforcement 
in the act of passing over for their relief. The loss sus- 
tained b}- both the garrisons, in killed, wounded and pri- 
soners, was about two hundred and fifty, more than one 
third of their whole number. That of the enemy was 
about two hundred killed and wounded. 

Governor Clinton arrived at Peekskill about an hour 
before midnight. A council was immediately called, in 
which it was decided to be impossible to maintain the 
post, against the superior numbers that would undoubtedly 
be brought down upon it the next day. It was conse- 
quently determined to retire with the troops to Fishkill, a 
strong post about twelve miles up the river, and to com- 
mence immediately the removal of the stores. 

The Continental frigates, which had been stationed 
above for the defence of the chain, were ordered down for 
that purpose, by General Putnam, as soon as the manoeu- 
vres of the enemy's ships indicated a purpose to ascend. 
It being no longer possible to defend the chain, after the 
loss of the forts, the frigates were burned, lest they should 
14 



314 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

fall into the enemy's hands. The boom and chain were 
soon after removed by the British, and their ships, having 
nothing to obstruct their passage, moved up the river. 

The forts on the east side having been evacuated imme- 
diately after the battle, as untenable against such a supe- 
rior force, a large detachment of the British, which had 
been all the day previous resting at Verplanck's Point, 
under the command of General Tryon, marched up and 
reduced Continental Village to ashes, with several dwell- 
ing-houses and other public buildings at Peekskill having 
first secured the valuable stores, which it had been neces- 
sary to leave behind. Another detachment, under Gene- 
ral Vaughan, proceeded up the river, about thirty miles, 
to Esopus, a little below Kingston, on the western shore, 
which they also destroyed laying waste in their progress 
many of the scattered dwellings, mills, and stores, of the 
defenceless inhabitants. The same was done at Living- 
ston's Manor, and several other places. This wanton and 
useless destruction of private property, instead of striking 
terror as they designed it should into the hearts of the 
rebels, reacted powerfully against the royal cause, and 
gave a keenness to the resentment of the injured party, 
\vhich outlasted many years the contest between the two 
nations.* 

* It would be neither just nor judicious to charge upon the British 
nation an unusual want of humanity in the conduct of their wars. 
Yet there are many such scenes as this recorded against them in every 
part of the world. There was another circumstance, connected with 
the battle above described, which reflects but little honor on the victors 
at Fort Montgomery. While they gave to their own killed a decent 
soliier's burial, the Americans left upon the bloody field were thrown 
in heaps, like so much carrion, into a pool in the rear of the fort. 
Dr. Dwight who, in company with several officers, visited the spot in 
May, seven months after the battle, thus describes the painful scene 
which greeted them there : " The first object which met our eyes, 



THE BRITISH ABANDON THE RIVER. 315 

The purpose of General Vaughan's expedition was to 
form a junction with General Burgoyne, whom he hoped 
to meet at Albany. But having, instead of that, encoun- 
tered, at some distance below Albany, the disagreeable 
and astounding intelligence of the surrender of that officer, 
with his whole army, the British general retired hastily 
down the river, abandoning all the advantages he had 
gained at so much cost to his enemy. Forts Montgomery 
and Constitution were entirely demolished, and fleet and 
army returned to New York, in twenty days after the 
battle. 

When General Vaughan went up the river, General 
Putnam detached one division of his force, under Governor 
Clinton, to follow him on the west side, while he proceed- 
ed with the other, on the east side, to prevent their land- 
ing, and committing ravages in the country. He had 
advanced as far as Red Hook, about thirty miles, when, 
the enemy commencing his retreat, he returned to his 

after we had left our barge and ascended the bank, was the remains 
of a fire, kindled by the cottagers of this solitude, for the purpose of 
consuming the bones of some of the Americans, who had fallen at 
this place, and had been left unburied. Some of these bones were 
lying, partially consumed, round the spot where the fire had been 
kindled ; and some had evidently been converted to ashes. As we 
went onward, we were distressed by the foetor of decayed human 
bodies. As we were attempting to discover the source from which 
it proceeded, we found, at a small distance from Fort Montgomery, 
a pond of a moderate size, in which we saw the bodies of several 
men, who had been killed in the assault upon the fort. They wore 
thrown into this pond, the preceding autumn, by the British, when, 
probably, the water was sufficiently deep to cover them. Some of 
them were covered at this time ; but at a depth so small, as to leave 
them distinctly visible. Others had an arm, a leg, or a part of the 
body, above the stfrfcce. The clothes which they wore when they 
were killed, were still on them, and proved that they were militia, 
being the ordinary dress of farmers." 



316 LIFE OF GENERAL PITNAM. 

post at Fishkill. The plan of this movement was com- 
municated to General Gates, who, having nearly complet- 
ed the terms of capitulation with Burgoyne, replied : " I 
shall now have nothing but General Clinton to think of. 
If you keep pace with him on one side, the Governor on 
the other, and I in front, I cannot see how he is to get 
home again." 

It was in the midst of these stirring and absorbing scenes, 
when heavily burdened with public cares, and overwhelm- 
ed with the calamities which had befallen him in his offi- 
cial capacity, as Commander in the Highlands, that Gene- 
ral Putnam was called again to experience the heaviest of 
domestic afflictions, in the loss of his wife. She died at 
his quarters, about a week after his removal to Fishkill ; 
and it is not improbable that her death was hastened, if 
not procured, by the exposure, inconvenience and fatigue, 
incident to this sudden change. General Washington, 
writing to him on the 19th of October, thus alludes to this 
severe bereavement : " I am extremely sorry for the death 
of Mrs. Putnam, and sympathize with you upon the occa- 
sion. Remembering that all must die, and that she had 
lived to an honorable age, I hope you will bear the misfor- 
tune with that fortitude and complacencv of mind that 
become a man and a Christian 

" I am, dear Sir, with great esteem, yours, &c., 

" GEORGE WASHINGTON." 

In the same despatch, which communicated these afflict- 
ive tidings to the Commander-in-chief, General Putnam 
announced the surrender of Burgoyne, and the retaking of 
Peekskill and the Highland passes on the east side of the 
river. His force had, in the meantime, been swelled by 
reinforcements of militia to six thousand. " Last Mon- 
day," he writes, " General Parsons, with about two thou- 
sand troops, marched down and took possession of Peeks- 



AN APPROPRIATE TEXT. 317 

kill, and the passes in the Highlands. Yesterday, about 
forty sail passed up the river crowded with troops, and are 
at anchor above Poughkeepsie the wind not favoring. 
We were on our march after them, when I met the agreea- 
ble intelligence of the surrender of General Burgoyne a 
copy of which is enclosed.* I thereupon most sincerely 
congratulate your Excellency. I have halted my troops, 
and am now considering what ought to be my movement. 
I have sent to Governor Clinton for his opinion, and order- 
ed General Parsons to spare no pains to find out the situa- 
tion and strength of the garrison at King's Bridge, in order 
to direct my future operations most advantageously." 

Rev. Dr. Dwight, then one of the most promising 
young divines in the country, was at this time a chaplain 
in the army, and attached to the brigade under General 
Parsons. On Sunday, the 19th, the day after the receipt 
of the cheering intelligence of the surrender of Burgoyne, 
he preached a sermon at Head-Quarters from this text 
" J will remove far off from you the northern army." 
Jotl ii., 20. It was, of course, an excellent and eloquent 
discourse, and, in the excitement of so interesting an occa- 
sion, gave infinite satisfaction to his hearers, the officers 
and soldiers of the army. Putnam, in particular, who 
was greatly attached to the preacher, was highly delighted 
with it, and did not fail to show his pleasure, by expressive 
looks and motions, during the progress of the service. On 
leaving the church, he was very earnest in commending 
the preacher's eloquence, and the remarkable appropriate- 
ness of his discourse ; declaring, at the same time, that 

* Washington received the first intelligence of this important 
event from General Putnam. General Gates sent a copy of the 
capitulation to him, and despatched a special messenger to communi- 
cate the tidings to Congress, but gave no notice whatever of the 
affair to the Commander-ic -chief. 



318 LIFE OF GENE R-A L PUTNAM. 

there was no such text in the Bible, and the good minister 
had been guilty of a pious fraud, in making up one for the 
occasion. It was not until the Bible was produced, and 
the passage read by his own eyes, that he yielded the 
point adding, as he did so, " There is everything in that 
book, and Dwight knows just where to lay his finger 
on it." 

General Clinton, in his despatch to General Washington, 
informing him of the loss of Forts Montgomery and Clin- 
ton, concluded with the following remarks : " I have only 
to add, that, where great losses are sustained, however 
unavoidable, public censure is generally the consequence 
to those who are immediately concerned. If in the pre- 
sent instance this should be the case, I wish, so far as 
relates to Fort Montgomery and its dependencies, it may 
fall on me alone ; for I should be guilty of the greatest 
injustice, were I not to declare, that the officers and men 
under me, of the different corps, behaved with the greatest 
spirit and bravery." 

The censure did not fall on him alone. General Put 
nam received a large share of it, as well as the whole of 
that which referred to the loss of the posts and valuables 
on the east side. The circumstances detailed above, which 
have been collected with great care from the most reliable 
sources, would seem to exonerate him from all blame. 
In his own post, he waited with prudence and firmness an 
expected attack, and would undoubtedly have resisted it 
to the last, if it had been made. To have attacked Gene- 
ral Tryon at Verplanck's Point, whose numbers were fully 
equal to his own, would have been to expose his defences 
to the main body of the British, whom he supposed to be 
still on board their ships in the river, aiming at those de- 
fences. That he was deceived by their manoeuvres, espe- 
cially in the then state of th'e atmosphere, was his misfor- 



VINDICATION FROM CENSURE. 319 

. 

tune, and not his fault. Other able and judicious officers, 
who were with him, were equally deceived. 

That he did not anticipate an attack in the rear of the 
western forts, and was surprised by it when it was made, 
indicated no want of that prudent consideration and watch- 
fulness, which are essential requisites to the character of a 
great commander. An attack from that quarter had been 
judged utterly impracticable by the able committee* of 
officers who had examined the ground, a few months be- 
fore. " We are very confident," say they, in their report, 
11 that the enemy will not attempt to operate by land, the 
passes through the Highlands are so exceedingly difficult." 
This opinion is fully confirmed by the reports of the British 
officers, who were engaged in this daring and difficult 
enterprise. A letter from one of them to his friend in 
London, published in Almon's Remembrancer, speaks 
feelingly of " the very many and extraordinary difficulties 
of this march over the mountains," and declares that they 
were obliged to contend with " every natural obstruction, 
and all that art could add to them." The movements on 
that side of the river were not seen by General Putnam, 
nor reported to him. As soon as the detachments had filed 
off from the landing, they were screened from his view by 
the mountains. 

As soon as he was made aware of the real designs of 
the enemy, he hastened to do all in his power to defeat 
them ; and but for the distance, and the difficulty of cross- 
ing the river, would, in all probability, have been success- 
ful. General Clinton says, " I can assure your Excel- 
lency, that I am well convinced, if night had not approach- 
ed rather too fast to correspond with our wishes, the enemy 
would have been disappointed in his expectations, as a 
reinforcement of five hundred men from General Putnam's 

* See page 291. 



320 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

army, were at the east side of the river, ready to pass for 
our relief, when the works were forced." 

Marshall says, " The whole force under General Put- 
nam did not much exceed two thousand." This includes 
six hundred in the forts on the west side, and two hun- 
dred at the Clove, from which Colonel Malcom's regiment 
had been withdrawn by Washington's orders. " Yet 
this force," he continues, " though far inferior to that 
which General Washington had ordered to be retained at 
the station, was, if properly applied, more than competent 
to the defence of the forts against any numbers which 
could be spared from New York. To insure success, it 
was necessary to draw the attention of Putnam from the 
real object, and to storm the works before the garrisons 
could be aided by his army. This Sir Henry Clinton ac- 
complished." 

In reference to the above passage in Italics, it will be 
remembered, that the Commander-in-chief, on withdraw- 
ing the greater part of the forces from Peekskill, to aid 
his own operations on the Delaware, had directed General 
Putnam, " in case he was threatened with an attack, to 
get what aid be could from the militia." On the arri- 
val of reinforcements to Sir Henry Clinton from Europe, 
this aid was immediately called for. But, to use the 
words of Governor Clinton, who was on the spot, " It 
being a critical time with the yeomanry, and as they had 
not yet sown their grain, and there being at that time no 
appearance of the enemy, they were extremely restless 
and uneasy. They solicited General Putnam for leave to 
return, and many of them went home without his permission. 
Urged by these considerations, he thought proper to dis- 
miss a part of them." As they were New York militia, 
brought there by the order of Governor Clinton, who com- 
manded in person at Fort Montgomery, it is not reasonable 



VINDICATED BY WASHINGTON. 321 

to suppose that they were discharged without his consent 
and approval. In speaking of it, he nowhere expresses or 
implies the slightest censure upon his superior. A subse- 
quent order was issued by Governor Clinton for a portion 
of these militia to return ; but, before they could arrive, 
the post was lost. 

With regard to the propriety of abandoning the posts on 
the east side of the river, and retiring to Fishkill, it was 
determined on in council, and has never been called in 
question by any respectable authority. Washington never 
expressed any dissatisfaction with the conduct of Putnam 
on this occasion. On hearing of the landing of the enemy 
at Verplanck's Point, he remarked, in a letter to Gover- 
nor Livingston, of New Jersey, " This circumstance is 
somewhat alarming, as the situation of our affairs this way, 
has obliged us to draw off so large a part of our force from 
Peekskill, that what now remains there may perhaps prove 
inadequate to the defence of i/." It will be seen hereafter 
that a Court of Inquiry, ordered by Congress to investi- 
gate this case, reported, that the loss was occasioned by 
want of men, and not by any fault in the commanders. 
This want of men, Putnam had used every means in his 
power to supply. " He had repeatedly informed the Com- 
mander-in-chief," says Humphreys, " that the posts com- 
mitted to his charge must, in all probability, be lost, in 
case an attempt should be made upon them ; and that, cir- 
cumstanced as he was, he could not be responsible for the 
consequences." General Washington, in replying to Clin 
ton's despatch, said, " I had the greatest hopes' that Ge 
neral Putnam would draw in as many Connecticut militia, 
as would replace the Continental troops, and I make no 
doubt but he did all in his power to obtain them in time." 
Aid of this kind could not be drawn in at a moment's 
warning, to such an extent as to render essential service.

And, at this particular time, the orders had gone out for 
reinforcements of militia, and some detachments were on 
the march, hut did not reach the post, till it had fallen into

IMMEDIATELY after the defeat of Burgoyne, large detach- 
ments, no longer needed at the north, were sent forward 
to Peekskill, until General Putnam's force, exclusive of 
the militia from New York and Connecticut, amounted to 
nearly nine thousand men. Before General Washington 
had received full advices of the important movements in 
the north, he suggested to General Putnam, by letter, the 
propriety of an attempt to cut off the retreat of Sir Henry 
Clinton to New York, and to get possession of the city ,

and ability to pursue the most proper and efficacious means 
to secure the end. 

Although the British General had already secured his 
retreat to New York, General Putnam immediately called 
a council of his principal officers, in which it was unani- 
mously determined, agreeably to the suggestions of the 
Commander-in-chief, that four thousand men should move 
down the west side of the Hudson, and take post near 
Haverstraw ; that one thousand should be retained in the 
Highlands, to guard the country and repair the works ; 
and that the remainder, under command of General Put- 
nam, should march down on the east side of the river, 
towards King's Bridge. The object proposed by this dis- 
position of the forces was to cause a diversion of the enemy 
in New York, and prevent a reinforcement being sent to 
General Howe ; and it was doubtless an ulterior purpose 
to attack the city, should a favorable opportunity present 
itself. 

General Dickinson, at the same time, and with the same 
object in view, proposed a similar plan, in which he ex- 
pected the co-operation of Putnam. This plan also Wash- 
ington highly commended, and urged its immediate execu- 
tion. General Putnam was deeply interested in this 
movement, and bent all his energies to secure it, but was 
prevented from even making the attempt in the same 
manner as he had been a few months before by the 
withdrawal of his force, to strengthen the main army on 
the Delaware. He was doubtless the more desirous to 
be the instrument of striking some important blow, at this 
time, as it would not only advance the good cause of his 
country, but in some degree make amends for the recent 
disasters in his department. 

While these projects were in contemplation, Putnam 
sent out some small detachments, to annoy the enemy, 



COL. HAMILTON'S MISSION. 325 

and to protect the country from their ravages. In one of 
these, Colonel Meigs, with a division of General Parsons' 
hrigade, made a forced march to VVestchester, where he 
surprised a band of freebooters, making fifty prisoners, and 
recovering a large number of horses and cattle, which 
they had recently stolen. 

General Howe was now in possession of Philadelphia, 
and the most vigorous measures were being made to open 
a communication with the fleet below. These measures 
it was Washington's principal aim to defeat ; and, suppos- 
ing that the British had no further designs on the north, 
he felt that the army in that quarter ought to furnish him 
with large and effective reinforcements. To this end, 
agreeably to the decision of a council of war convened for 
that purpose, he commissioned Colonel Hamilton to pro- 
ceed to Albany, to confer with General Gates on the sub- 
ject, and procure all the aid he could. He was, at the 
same time, directed to call on General Putnam, and desire 
him to send forward two brigades Nixon's and Glover's 
with all possible despatch. 

On arriving at Putnam's Head Quarters, Colonel Hamil- 
ton directed him, in the name of the Commander-in-chief, 
to forward the two Continental brigades named in his in- 
structions, and another of Massachusetts militia, consisting 
of sixteen hundred men, under General Warner, whose 
term of service would expire in about four weeks. He 
also procured an order for the instant despatch of the regi- 
ments previously called for, which had been delayed partly 
by the hope, on the part of Putnam, of being able im- 
mediately to put in execution his project against New 
York. It was understood, also, that, in addition to these, 
Poor's New Hampshire brigade, then just arrived from 
Albany, should proceed at once to join the main army. 

Hamilton then proceeded to Albany, to confer with Ge- 



326 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM 

neral Gates. On his return to New Windsor, just a week 
subsequent to his previous visit, he was greatly disappoint- 
ed that the expected reinforcements had not gone forward 
The statement can be best understood from his own letter 
to Washington, dated New Windsor, November 10th : " I 
am pained beyond expression to inform your Excellency, 
that, on my arrival here, I find everything has been ne- 
glected and deranged by General Putnam, and that the 
two brigades, Poor's and Learned's, still remain here, and 
on the other side at Fishkill. Colonel Warner's militia, 
I am told, have been drawn to Peekskill, to aid in an ex- 
pedition against New York, which it seems is at this time 
the hobby-horse with General Putnam. Not the least 
attention has been paid to my order in your name, for a 
detachment of one thousand men from the troops hitherto 
stationed at this post. Everything is sacrificed to the 
whim of taking New York. 

" The two brigades of Poor and Learned, it appears, 
would not march for want of money and other necessaries ; 
several of the regiments having received no pay for six or 
eight months. There has been a high mutiny among the 
former on this account, in which a captain killed a man, 
and was himself shot by his comrade. These difficulties, 
for want of proper management, have stopped the troops 
from proceeding. * * * By Governor Clinton's ad- 
vice, I have sent an order, in the most emphatical terms, 
to General Putnam, immediately to despatch all the Conti- 
nental troops under him to your assistance, and to detain 
the militia instead of them. 

" My opinion is, that the only present use of troops in 
this quarter, is to protect the country from the depredations 
of little plundering parties, and for carrying on the works 
necessary for the defence of the river. Nothing more 
ought to be thought of. It is only wasting time, and mis- 



HAMILTON'S LETTERS. 327 

applying men, to employ them in a suicidal parade against 
New York. 

" If your Excellency agrees with me in opinion, it will 
be well to send instant directions to General Putnam, to 
pursue the object I have mentioned ; for I doubt whether 
he will attend to anything I say, notwithstanding it comes 
in the shape of a positive order. I fear, unless you inter- 
fere, the works here will go on so feebly, for want of men, 
that they will not be completed in time. I wish General 
Putnam was recalled from the command of this post, and 
Governor Clinton would accept it ; the blunders and ca- 
prices of the former are endless." 

In another letter, written two days later, he says, " I 
believe the past delay is wholly chargeable to General 
Putnam. Indeed, I owe it to the service to say, that 
'every part of this gentleman's conduct is marked with blun- 
ders and negligence, and gives general disgust." 

Colonel Hamilton's order to General Putnam, above 
alluded to, is in the following pointed and authoritative lan- 
guage : " I cannot forbear confessing, that I am astonish- 
ed and alarmed beyond measure to find, that all his Excel- 
lency's views have been hitherto frustrated, and that no sin- 
gle step of those I mentioned to you has been taken, to 
afford him the aid he absolutely stands in need of, and by 
delaying which the cause of America is put to the utmost 
conceivable hazard. I so fully explained to you the Ge- 
neral's situation, that I could not entertain a doubt, you 
would make it the first object of your, attention, to rein- 
force him with that speed the exigency of affairs demand- 
ed ; but, I am sorry to say, he will have too much reason 
to think, other objects, in connection with that insignifi- 
cant, have been uppermost. I speak freely and emphati- 
cally, because I tremble at the consequences of the delay 
that has happened. Sir Henry Clinton's reinforcement is

probably by this time with General Howe. This will give 
him a decided superiority over our army. What may be 
the issue of such a state of things, I leave to the feelings 
of every friend of his country, capable of foreseeing conse- 
quences. My expressions may perhaps have more 
warmth, than is altogether proper, but they proceed from 
the overflowing of my heart, in a matter where I conceive 
this continent essentially interested. 

" I wrote to you from Albany, and desired you would 
send a thousand Continental troops, of those first proposed 
to be left with you. This I understand has not been done. 
How the non-compliance can be answered to General 
Washington, you can best determine. I now, sir, in the 
most explicit terms, by his Excellency's authority, give it 
as a positive order from him, that all the Continental 
troops under your command may be immediately marched 
to King's Ferry, there to cross the river, and hasten to rein- 
force the army under him. The Massachusetts militia are 
to be detained instead of them, until the troops coming 
from the northward arrive. When they do, they will 
replace, as far as I am instructed, the troops you shall send 
away in consequence of this requisition. The General's 
idea of keeping troops this way, does not extend further 
than covering the country from any little irruptions of 
small parties, and carrying on the works necessary for the 
security of the river. As to attacking New York, that 
he thinks ought to be out of the question for the present. 
If men could be spared from other really necessary objects, 
he would have no objection to attempting a diversion by 
way of New York. 1 ' 

The writer will yield to no man in respect for the talents, 
and eminent public services, of Alexander Hamilton. But 
it is obvious to remark that, at the period when these let- 
ters were written, he was scarcely twenty years old, and 



COMPLAINTS OF HAMILTON'S LETTER. 329 

without any military knowledge or experience; while the 
person, of whom he speaks in terms of unsparing censure, 
and harsh disrespect, was an old soldier, a veteran officer, 
on whose head the frosts of three score winters had fallen, 
and whose martial virtues and martial deeds, in two wars, 
had won the admiration of friend and foe alike, and 
wreathed his brow with undying laurels. His opinions 
would certainly have lost no weight in this case, if they 
had been given in a tone and manner more becoming his 
relative position. 

Among the published letters of Washington, there is no 
reply to these communications, from which his opinion of 
them may be gathered. In his letters to General Putnam, 
on the subject, while he makes it sufficiently appear that 
he was disappointed in not receiving earlier succor from 
that quarter, his language is uniformly respectful and kind. 

General Putnam enclosed a copy of Hamilton's letter to 
General Washington, and added: " It contains some most 
unjust and ungenerous reflections, for I am conscious of 
having done everything in my power to succor you as soon 
as possible. I shall go to. New Windsor this day, to see 
Colonel Hamilton, and, until I have orders from you, I 
cannot think of continuing at this post, and send all the 
troops away. If they should go away, I am confident 
General Howe will be further reinforced from this quar- 
ter." He then stated, in confirmation of this opinion, 
what he knew of the strength of the enemy in New York. 

On the receipt of this letter, Washington replied as fol- 
lows : " The urgency of Colonel Hamilton's letter was 
owing to his knowledge of our wants in this quarter, and 
to a certainty that there was no danger to be apprehended 
from New York, if you sent away all the Continental 
troops that were then with you, and waited to replace 
them by those expected down the river. I cannot but say 



330 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

there has been more delay in the march of the troops, 
than I think necessary ; and I could wish that, in future, 
my orders may be immediately complied with, without 
arguing upon the propriety of them. If any accident en- 
sues from obeying them, the fault will be upon me, and 
not upon you." 

It is not proposed to chiim for General Putnam entire 
exemption from faults, either as a man, or an officer. He 
was probably somewhat remiss in his duty on this occasion. 
But he was, by no means, entitled to the severe remarks of 
Hamilton. It is evident that Washington, though he approv- 
ed of the zeal and energy of his Aide-de-camp, must have 
viewed the whole matter, as it related to Putnam, in a 
totally different light. For it is hard to perceive how a 
measure proposed by General Putnam, in which General 
Dickinson was to bear a part, should be regarded worthy 
to be spoken of only as a " hobby," a " whim," and a 
" caprice ;" while the same measure, proposed by Gene- 
ral Dickinson, at the same time, and embracing in its 
arrangements the co-operation of General Putnam, should 
meet with entire approbation and respect. " Your idea," 
says Washington to Dickinson, " I think an exceedingly 
good one, and I am very desirous that you should improve 
and mature it for immediate execution. I am in great 
hopes it will effect the valuable purpose which you ex- 
pect ;" which was, to prevent General Howe from 
receiving any further reinforcements from New York.* 
This letter was written on the 4th of November, two days 
after Hamilton's first interview with Putnam, and conse- 
quently while, the former was at Albany. It was only one 

* General Putnam had just learned from his spies, and commu- 
nicated to Washington, the fact, that four regiments were immediately 
to be sent round to the Delaware from New York. Writings, vol. v.,

THE TRUE STATE OF THE CASE. 331 

week before that interview, that Putnam himself had 
received the first suggestion of the Commander-in-chief, 
that a movement toward New York, if well conducted, 
might be safe and advantageous. It is impossible, there- 
fore, to suppose, that Washington could have viewed the 
designs of Putnam in this contemptuous light, or justified 
the use of such reproachful terms in relation to it ; unless, 
for the time, he was wholly divested of that consistency 
and sense of justice, for which he was eminently distin- 
guished. 

It cannot fail to strike the most careless reader as sin- 
gular, that while, in one paragraph, it is represented, that 
" everything had been neglected and deranged by General 
Putnam," and that Poor's and Learned's brigades were 
detained at Fishkill by his fault alone, the very next para- 
graph begins with the acknowledgment, that " the two bri- 
gades of Poor and Learned would not march for want of 
money and other necessaries several of the regiments having 
received no pay for six or eight months. There has been 
a high mutiny on this account," &c. That this was the 
only real difficulty in the way, there is no doubt ; and 
there is ample evidence that Putnam used every means in 
his power to overcome it. His letters to the Commander- 
in-chief on the subject were frequent and pressing ; and 
Washington called the special attention of Congress to the 
matter, on the 10th of November the very date of Ham- 
ilton's second and severe letter in the following words : 
" I would beg leave to mention, that we are in great dis- 
tress for want of money. This will be more urgent every 
day ; and it is probable there will be a good deal of pay 
due to the troops coming to reinforce us. General Putnam 
writes prcssingly for a supply, and says he is in the most dis- 
agreeable situation for want of it." 

If the troops " would not march " without their arrears 



332 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

of pay, resisting even to mutiny and blood ; and if, with 
the aid of the eloquent Governor Clinton, Hamilton could 
not himself induce them to march, till he had borrowed 
six thousand dollars to meet this very difficulty, it would 
seem that he might have spared the old veteran some por- 
tion of those severe reflections. The mutiny took place 
before Hamilton's arrival. Against whom did they mutiny, 
if not against him who ordered them to march ? And who 
had issued that order but the commander of the post ? 

The truth is, there was a prejudice against Putnam, 
among the people of New York, and the political leaders 
had determined to have him removed from the command 
in the Highlands.* The precise grounds of this prejudice 
do not distinctly appear. If it was an alleged incompe 
tency to such a command, it is manifest that they differed 
widely in their judgment from Washington, who had had 
far better opportunities to know and judge of his qualifica- 
tions. Colonel Humphreys says : "The indulgence which 
he showed, whenever it did not militate against his duty, 
towards the deserted and suffering families of the tories in 
the State of New York, was the cause of his becoming 
unpopular with no inconsiderable class of people in that 
State. On the other side, he had conceived an uncon- 
querable aversion to many of the persons who were en- 
trusted with the disposal of tory property, because he 
believed them to have been guilty of peculations, and 
other infamous practices." 

Dr. Sparks observes : " It must be remembered, that at 
this station there were innumerable applications for pass- 
ports to go into New York, under the pretence of urgent 
business, and various matters of a private concern ; and it 
was thought General Putnam's good nature was too pliant 
on these occasions, and that too many opportunities were

WASHINGTON'S OPINION. 333 

afforded for an improper intercourse between the disaffect- 
ed and the enemy. At any rate, the symptoms of uneasi- 
ness appeared from such high sources, and were so decid- 
edly manifested, that General Washington deemed it 
necessary to take notice of them, and change the com- 
mand." 

In recalling General Putnam from this command, Wash- 
ington, by the clearest implication, disavows any and every 
ground of censure or disapprobation, on his own part. 
" My reason for making this change," he says, " is owing 
to the prejudices of the people, which, whether well or 
ill grounded, must be indulged ; and I should think myself 
wanting in justice to the public, and candor towards you, 
were I to continue you in a command, after I have been 
in almost direct terms informed, that the people of the 
State of New York will not render the necessary support 
and assistance, while you remain at the head of that de- 
partment." Here is no intimation of incompetency or 
unfaithfulness, or of any reason, so far as the Commander- 
in-chief was concerned, why General Putnam should not 
retain the station he had held. It is clearly implied that, 
but for " the prejudices of the people," he would not have 
be^n removed, and consequently, that neither Washing- 
ton's wishes, nor Washington's private views of the good 
of the service, required his removal. And this was writ- 
ten in March, five months after Hamilton's mission. 

On the 28th of November, a Court of Inquiry was order- 
ed by Congress, to investigate the causes of the loss of 
Forts Montgomery and Clinton. This order was not exe- 
cuted by Washington until the 16th of March following, 
thousrh he had lonu; before decided, that the wishes of New 

O O t 

York should be regarded, in relation to the command of the 
Highlands, as appears by his letter to General Gates, of 
the 2d of December Four days after the passage of this 



3iJ4 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

order, Washington addressed a letter to Governor Clinton, 
requesting his acceptance of that post. In urging this 
point, he makes use of the following argument, which 
demands, in this connection, a word of explanation. 
" You may rest assured," says he, " that there are no im- 
pediments on the score of delicacy, or superior command, 
that shall not be removed." 

Governor Clinton was a man of eminent ability, and 
unbounded influence in New York, and no better selection 
ctfuld have been made, on both these accounts. But his 
rank in the Continental army was only that of a brigadier- 
general, of recent appointment. Not only every major- 
general in the army, therefore, but all the brigadiers, 
among whom were some of the ablest and most popular 
men on the list, were implicated in this remark. It could 
not be tortured into a disrespectful reference to General 
Putnam, inasmuch as his removal had already been de- 
cided upon, on entirely different grounds, and an inquiry 
had been ordered, which rendered necessary a temporary 
suspension from all command. 

To return to the narrative, though Putnam's force was 
now greatly reduced, he was not inactive. The continual 
changes which were taking place in his command the 
removal of his men from place to place the miserable, 
broken, half-hearted service rendered by the militia and 
the extreme destitution, at times, of money, and of many 
of the comforts and necessaries of life, made it altogether 
an unenviable post, and occasioned considerable delay in 
the prosecution of the repairs on the defences, which had 
been demolished by the British. 

Not long after the continental troops had been with- 
drawn, General Putnam moved down, with a part of the 
forces that remained, and approached the enemy's posts 
on the east side of the Hudson. On the 27th of Novem- 



P A R T I Z A N ENTERPRISES. 335 

ber, General Dickinson made a descent upon Staten Island, 
with about fourteen hundred men. He landed, before 
daylight, at Halstead's Point, in three divisions, which 
marched into the island seven miles, by three different 
routes, and met at the appointed place of rendezvous. 
The principal object of this expedition was to surprise 
General Skinner, the celebrated tory refugee, and General 
Campbell, who were stationed there. The most profound 
secresy was observed as to the design of the expedition 
few even of the officers knowing anything of their destina- 
tion, till the very moment of starting. And yet General 
Skinner received intelligence of their approach, in season 
to effect his escape, with the main body of his force. 
Some skirmishes ensued, and five or six of the enemy ' 
were killed, and twenty-four taken prisoners. General 
Dickinson returned without effecting his object, but he 
received the commendation of Washington on his enter- 
prise, and the judgment he had shown in arranging his 
plan. 

To aid this enterprise, and at the request of General 
Dickinson, Putnam sent out Parsons and Warner, with 
their brigades, towards King's Bridge, to make a diversion 
in that quarter. Putnam reconnoitred in person within 
three miles of King's Bridge. But, finding no opportunity 
to operate with effect on that point, he diverged to New 
Rochelle, where he made a disposition to cross over to 
Long Island, and attack the forts at Huntington and Satau- 
ket. But the enemy received warning, in season to 
evacuate the forts before his preparations for embarkation 
were completed. 

Having received intelligence that small parties of the 
enemy were out, under the orders of Governor Tryon, to 
lay waste the property of the unprotected, Putnam imme- 
diately detached three parties of one hundred mi-n each, 



336 LIFE Of GENERAL PUTNAM. 

to prevent their depredations. Two of them were suc- 
cessful in their manoeuvres, and returned, one with thirty 
five, and the other with forty prisoners. The third party 
of the enemy succeeded in effecting their purpose, so far 
as to burn the house of a Mr. Van Tassel, a noted whig, 
and a member of the committee of safety, compelling him 
to accompany them naked and barefooted, over frozen 
ground and ice, to their quarters. Determined to show 
the enemy that firing houses was a game which two could 
play at, and that the loss was not necessarily all on one 
side, General Putnam directed Captain Buchanan to cross 
over to York Island in a whale-boat, and fire the house of 
General Oliver Delancy, one of the leading loyalists of 
that place. This act of justifiable retaliation had, for a 
time, the desired effect, of arresting this species of unmean- 
ing and wanton destruction. 

About the same time, one of Putnam's scouting parties, 
learning that Colonel James Delancy was at West Farms, 
a little below Westchester, determined to make him a 
prisoner. They, accordingly, surrounded the house where 
he lodged, and proceeded to search it. When the alarm 
was given, he jumped out of bed, and endeavored to con- 
ceal himself under it. But he was soon discovered, drag- 
ged forth, and carried to Head-Quarters. He was a tory 
of too much value to be spared long, and Sir Henry Clin- 
ton soon found means to effect an exchange for him. He 
was afterward leader of a gang of irregulars, or bandits, 
known by the name of cowboys, and made himself infa- 
mously immortal, by every species of cruelty and excess. 

Though the season was far advanced into winter, and 
ihe weather was very severe, another and more serious 
enterprise was undertaken by General Putnam, the execu- 
tion of which was entrusted to General Parsons and 
Colonel Webb. The object was a descent upon Long 



DESCENT UPON LONG ISLAND. 337 

Island, having four objects in view : to destroy a quantity 
of lumber, which the enemy was preparing, at the east 
end of the island, for the erection of new barracks in New 
York to set fire to a number of coasting vessels, at the 
same place, loading with wood for the British forces at 
Newport to attack a regiment, then quartered about 
eight miles east of Jamaica and to remove, or destroy, 
whatever public stores they should find on the island. 

By the plan of operations, General Parsons was to exe- 
cute the first part, at the east end of the island ; Colonel 
Meigs was to land at Hempstead Harbor, and attack the 
regiment near Jamaica ; and Colonel Webb was to land 
near Huntington, to support Meigs, and to render such 
aid to the eastern division, under Parsons, as might be 
required. Meigs was prevented from crossing the Sound, 
by the unfavorable state of the weather. The other two 
divisions started with fair prospects ; but, unfortunately 
for Colonel Webb, he encountered in his passage the 
British sloop-of-war Falcon. Being only in a common 
transport, without guns, he could not offer battle, or 
attempt a defence. In endeavoring to escape, he was 
driven on shore so far from the beach, that he and all his 
party were taken prisoners. They attempted to reach 
the land in boats ; but the surf ran so high that the boats 
were swamped the moment they touched the water, 
and they had no remedy but to give themselves up to 
the foe. 

General Parsons effected his landing in safety, and suc- 
ceeded in destroying a large quantity of timber, boards, 
and wood, and one of the enemy's vessels. Captain Hart, 
of this party, with a detachment of forty men, attacked a 
number of boats near the shore, killing eight, and wound- 
ing eleven among whom was the captain of one of the 
British sloops-of-\var. General Parsons returned, vrith

his whole party unhurt, and twenty of the enemy pri- 
soners. The loss of the other party, by the Falcon, was 
sixty-five : viz. Colonel Webb, with four officers, twenty 
privates of his continental regiment, and forty militia, all 
picked men.

ABOUT the middle of December, General Putnam, by 
direction of the Commander-in-chief, returned to his post 
in the Highlands, with instructions to employ his whole 
force, and all the means in his power, for erecting and 
completing, as far as possible, such works and obstructions 
as might be necessary to defend and secure the river 
against any future attempts of the enemy. With a view 
to the more diligent prosecution of these works, he was 
advised to confine his attention exclusively to them, with- 
out attempting any active measures to annoy the enemy 
or to protect the country against his incursions. 



340 * I F E Or GENERAL PUTNAM. 

All to forts, and other works of defence in the High- 
lands, ha 1 been entirely demolished by the British, during 
their twenty days' occupancy ; and it now became a ques- 
tion of importance whether these should be restored in 
their former positions, or new and more eligible places 
selected for the purpose. There were differences of opi- 
nion on this subject, among those whose interest and co- 
operation were essential to its progress. And it was this, 
together with the pressing want of money, and the poverty 
and hard fare of the soldiers, which occasioned the delay 
in the prosecution of the works, so often complained of by 
Washington in his letters ; and not any want of activity or 
zeal on the part of General Putnam. 

With a view to settle this question definitely and for 
ever, and proceed vigorously with the work, a thorough 
survey of the whole region was made in the early part of 
January, by General Putnam, accompanied by Governor 
Clinton, General James Clinton, and several other distin- 
guished gentlemen among whom was Colonel Radiere, 
a French engineer of some celebrity. All, except Ra- 
JiSre, united in the opinion that West Point was the most 
eligible place to be fortified. Radiere opposed this deci- 
sion with considerable vehemence, and drew up a memo- 
rial, designed to show that the site of Fort Clinton pos- 
sessed advantages much superior to West Point. The 
British commander, Sir Henry Clinton, and his associates, 
seem to have entertained the same high opinion of the 
advantageous position of Fort Clinton ; for, while they 
demolished all the other forts, they commenced repairing 
and strengthening that, for future operations. It is possi- 
ble that this circumstance may have had some influence in 
affecting the decision of Radiere. 

As the French engineer was a man of science, and pos- 
sessed the confidence of Congress and the Commander-in- 



FORTIFICATIONS AT WEST POINT. 341 

chief, it was deemed expedient by General Putnam to 
consult the Council and Assembly of New York, before 
he came to a final determination. At his suggestion, a 
committee was appointed by those bodies, who were em- 
ployed three days in carefully reconnoitring the borders 
of the river in the Highlands, and attending to all the 
suggestions of the more experienced military men who 
accompanied them, in reference to the several points deem- 
ed most capable of defence. After a patient and careful 
examination of every position, and every argument, they 
decided unanimously in favor of West Point thus agree- 
ing with every person authorized to act in the affair, ex- 
cept the engineer. It was accordingly decided, on the 
13th of January, that the fortifications should be erected 
at West Point. Colonel RadiSre was sorely piqued at 
this result, and manifested his ill-will on the occasion by 
a petulant, unaccommodating behavior, and by the over- 
bearing manner in which he presented his estimates and 
requisitions, which were altogether disproportioned to 
the finances of the government, and only served, as Hum- 
phreys remarks, " to remind them of their poverty, and 
satirize their resources." He was not long after replaced 
by the celebrated Kosciusko ; after which the works went 
forward with more spirit. 

Colonel Humphreys, who was on the spot at the time, 
claims for General Putnam the whole merit of the selec- 
tion of this post ; and adds " It is no vulgar praise to 
say, that to him belongs the glory of having chosen this 
rock of our military salvation. The position for water- 
batteries, which might sweep the channel where the river 
formed a right angle, made it the most proper of any for 
commanding the navigation ; while the rocky ridges that 
rose in awful sublimity behind each other, rendered it 
impregnable and even incapable of being invested by less 



342 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

than twenty thousand men. The British, who considered 
this post as a sort of American Gibraltar, never attempted 
it but by the treachery of an American officer." 

It is impossible to say to whom the credit of originality, 
in this case, belongs ; nor is it a matter of much impor- 
tance with reference to men who had so many other and 
more substantial titles to fame. The first recorded sug- 
gestion in reference to this point, of which we have any 
knowledge, is contained in the letter of Governor Clinton 
to General Washington, dated December 20th, about tw;> 
weeks before the survey above spoken of. After declin- 
ing, for reasons of state, the proffered command in the 
Highlands, he freely offers his advice and assistance, wher- 
ever and by whomsoever they may be needed gives 
several important hints respecting the construction of new 
works on the river and especially recommends that a 
" strong fortress should be erected at West Point, opposite 
to Fort Constitution." 

Before the close of January, when the snow was two 
feet deep, General Parsons, with his brigade, went over 
to West Point and broke ground. It is difficult, at this 
day, to conceive of the many impediments which then 
existed, in the way of completing such necessary works j 
or the toil and suffering involved in their prosecution. 
The better to understand and appreciate it, the reader 
should remember that it was the same memorable season, 
when Washington, with his wasted, half-clothed, half-fed 
army, was freezing in his comfortless winter quarters, at 
Valley Forge. The marvel is, how such an army was 
held together at all, under such circumstances ; and how 
works of any description could go forward by the agency 
of men so poorly paid, so miserably provided for. And 
yet, such was the energy and zeal displayed by all con- 
cerned, that the works went forward with unexpected 



OBSTRUCTIONS IN THE RIVER. 343 

rapidity and success. It was in forwarding and encourag- 
ing these works, observes Colonel Humphreys, " that the 
patriotism of Governor Clinton shone in full lustre. His 
exertions to forward supplies can never be too much com- 
mended. His influence, arising from his popularity, was 
unlimited ; yet he hesitated not to put all his popularity at 
risk, whenever the federal interests demanded it. Not- 
withstanding the impediments that opposed our progress, 
with his aid, before the opening of the campaign, the works 
were in great forwardness." 

Fortifications alone were not regarded as sufficient for 
the purpose of guarding the river, without other contri- 
vances to obstruct the passage of ships. Resort was, 
therefore, to be had to chains, booms, and chevaux-de-frise t 
as before at Fort Montgomery. All these works were in 
the course of preparation together. 

On the thirteenth of February, one month after the site 
had been determined upon, General Putnam wrote to the 
Commander-in-chief, as follows : " At my request, the 
Legislature of this State have appointed a committee, to 
fix the places and manner of securing the river, and to 
afford some assistance in expediting the work. The state 
of affairs now at this post, you will please to observe, is as 
follows : The chain and necessary anchors are contracted 
for, to be completed by the first of April ; and, from the 
intelligence I have received, there is reason to believe they 
will be finished by that time. Parts of the boom intended 
to have been used at Fort Montgomery, sufficient for 
this purpose, are remaining. Some of the iron is exceed- 
ingly bad ; this I hope to have replaced with good iron 
soon. The chevaux-de-frise witf be completed by the time 
the river will admit of sinking them. The batteries near 
the water, and the fort to cover them, are laid out. The 
latter is within the walls six hundred yards around, twen- 



344 LIFE OF OKNKRAL PUTNAM. 

ty-one feet base, fourteen feet high, the talus (or slope) 
two inches to the foot. This, I fear, is too large to be 
completed by the time expected. Governor Clinton and 
the committee have agreed to this plan, and nothing on 
my part shall be wanting, to complete it in the best and 
most expeditious manner. Barracks and huts for about 
three hundred men are completed, and barracks for about 
the same number are nearly covered. A road to the river 
has been made with great difficulty." 

He then proceeds to enumerate some of the difficulties 
with which he had to contend, in the prosecution of his 
work. "Meigs's regiment, except those under inoculation 
with the small-pox, is at White Plains ; and, until the 
barracks can be fitted for their reception, I have thought 
best to continue them there, to cover the country from the 
incufisions of the enemy. Dubols's regiment is vnjit to be 
ordered on duty, there being not one blanket in the regiment. 
Very few have either a shoe or a shirt, and most of them have 
neither stockings, breeches, nor overalls. Several companies 
of enlisted artificers are in the same situation, and unable to 
work in the field. Several hundred men are rendered use- 
less, merely for want of necessary apparel, as no clothing 
is permitted to be stopped at this post. General Parsons 
has returned to camp some time since, and takes upon 
himself the command to-morrow, when I shall set out for 
Connecticut." 

That these statements are in no way exaggerated, there 
is evidence enough in all the chronicles of the day. For 
the painful counterpart, in all its hideous nakedness, see 
Washington's letters to Congress, of the 23d of Decem- 
ber* to Governor Livingston of the 31st of the same 
month to Governor Clinton of the 16th, and to Congress 

* Writings, vol. v., pages 197 and 206. 



COURT OF INQUIRY. 345 

of the 27th of February.* The latter, in direct allusion 
to the above, says : "The enclosed extract of a letter from 
General Putnam will show how great the distresses are* 
in that quarter for want of money. He has described their 
necessities so fully, that it is unnecessary for me to add 
upon the subject. I shall only observe, that his account 
is more than justified by many other letters, and that I am 
persuaded the earliest possible supply will be forwarded, 
and that the very important and interesting works carrying 
on there may not be the least retarded." 

As soon as General Putnam could conveniently return 
from Connecticut, where his private affairs demanded 
attention at this time, the Court of Inquiry, which had 
been ordered in November, was organized. It consisted 
of Major-General McDougall, Brigadier-General Hunting- 
ton, and Colonel Wigglesworth.f The following is an 
extract from Washington's letter to General McDougall, 
apprizing him of this appointment : " You will observe by 
the words of the resolve (of Congress), that the inquiry is 
to be made into the loss of Forts Montgomery and Clinton, 
in the State of New York, and into the conduct of the 
principal officers commanding those forts. Hence the 
officer commanding-in-chief in that department will be 
consequentially involved in the inquiry ; because, if he has 
been deficient in affording the proper support to those 
posts, when called upon to do it, the commandant and

t It may be well to remark that such inquiries are almost invaria- 
bly instituted in relation to military enterprises which are attended 
with disastrous results. They do not by any means necessarily 
imply a diminution of confidence in the officers whose conduct is 
implicated in the inquiry. They are part of a great system, as 
necessary to the reputation of the officers, as to the due adjustment 
of discipline and reward In the army. 
15* 



346 LIKE OF G E N K H A L PUTNAM. 

principal officers will of course make it appear, by the 
evidence produced in their own justification." 
' General McDougall w r as at the same time invested with 
the command in the Highlands, respecting which it was 
remarked: "lam sensible this command will not be in 
itself the most agreeable piece of service, and that you 
would prefer a post on the principal theatre of action ; but 
the vast importance of it has determined me to confide it 
to you, and I am persuaded your object is to be useful to 
the public." General Putnam had fully realized the 
truth of these remarks, respecting the character of the post 
in the Highlands. But it was always a principle with 
him, never to shrink from any service, or complain of any 
duty, because it was disagreeable. 

It was on this occasion, when it became necessary to 
suspend his command for a season, in order to subject him 
to this trial, that Washington explained to Putnam the 
necessity he was under, growing out of the prejudices of 
the people of New York, of recalling him altogether from 
that post. 

The Court of Inquiry, after a patient and careful exami- 
nation of all the facts in the case, were unanimously of 
opinion, and made report accordingly, that the disaster 
of the fifth of October, 1777, in which Forts Montgomery 
and Clinton were lost, was occasioned only by the want 
of men sufficient for their proper defence, and not by any 
fault of the commanders. 

This investigation being satisfactorily terminated, Gene- 
ral Putnam was requested partly, no doubt, with refer- 
ence to his own convenience to return to Connecticut, 
and hasten with all possible expedition, the march from 
that quarter of the new levies of militia for the coming 
campaign, which Washington apprehended would open 
early, and prove an active and decisive one. This seemed 



PUTNAM RETURNS TO THE CAMP. 347 

the more certain, when, about the 1st of May, intelligence 
was received of the conclusion of a treaty of alliance be- 
tween France and the United States. It was the first 
formal recognition, by any of the nations, of American 
Independence, and was responded to, in all parts of the 
country, by universal acclamations of joy. It inspired all 
hearts with confidence. Washington, writing to Putnam 
on the occasion, ever as watchful and prudent as he was 
firm and hopeful in the goodness and ultimate success of 
his cause, said : " I hope that the fair, and, I may say, 
certain prospect of success will not induce us to relax." 

Except a few ordinary skirmishes, and the able retreat 
of Lafayette from Barren Hill, nothing of any moment 
occurred till the last of June, when the successful attack 
upon the retreating foe at Monmouth, gave fresh eclat to 
the American cause. Immediately after this felicitous 
event, General Putnam returned to the camp, and took the 
command of the right wing of the army, recently com- 
manded by General Lee, who was then under arrest for 
his conduct in the battle of Monmouth. Without any 
action of importance, the army was concentrated about 
the North River, as the enemy retired to New York. The 
season passed away with little else than marches and 
countermarches, with the view of being always ready for 
any decided movement on the part of Sir Henry Clintoo. 

About the first of September, when the preparations 
known to be making in New York indicated a combined 
attack, by sea and land, on the French fleet at Boston, 
dispositions were made to move in that direction. With 
this view General Gates, with three brigades, was ordered 
to proceed to Danbury, in Connecticut. Washington 
moved as far as Fredericksburg, about thirty miles from 
the river, on the way to Boston. General Putnam, with 
two brigades, was left in the neighborhood of West Point, 



348 LIFE Or GENERAL PUTNAM. 

for the defence of the North River, which, in the language 
of Washington, was one of the three capital objects at 
which the enemy would necessarily direct his force, and 
which it was his first duty to defend. General McDou- 
gall, with two other brigades, was ordered to join General 
Gates at Danbury. 

As no serious demonstrations were made by the enemy 
in either of these directions, the whole army, after remain- 
ing in this position more than two months, retired into 
winter quarters. General McDougall returned to his 
command in the Highlands, and General Putnam, with 
three brigades, composed of the New Hampshire and Con- 
necticut troops, together with Hazen's corps of infantry 
and Sheldon's of cavalry, was posted in the vicinity of 
Danbury, for the threefold purpose of protecting the coun- 
try lying along the Sound covering the magazines on the 
Connecticut River and being ready to reinforce the 
Highlands, on any serious movement of the enemy in that 
direction. 

In the course of the winter, a spirit of insubordination, 
arising from the many hardships they had suffered, and 
the long arrearages of pay now due, manifested itself 
among a portion of the troops at Danbury ; and, but for 
the vigor, promptness and address of their veteran com- 
mander, whom they loved and respected, it might have 
been attended with the most serious results. The General 
Assembly of Connecticut was then in session at Hartford ; 
and a plan was matured by the two brigades belonging to 
that State, of marching to that place in a body, and de- 
manding redress, at the point of the bayonet, for the griev- 
ances under which they labored. The second brigade 
was already under arms for this purpose, when intelligence 
of their proceedings was brought to General Putnam. He 
instantly mounted his horse, galloped down to their can- 



MUTINY IN CONNECTICUT. 349 

tonment, and, in his plain, blunt manner, thus addressed 
them : " My brave lads, whither are you going ? Do you 
intend to desert your officers, and to invite the enemy to 
follow you into the country ? In whose cause have you 
been righting and suffering so long ? Is it not your own ? 
Have you no property ? no parents ? no wives ? no chil- 
dren ? You have thus far behaved like men the world 
is full of your praises and posterity will stand astonished 
at your deeds ; but not if you spoil it all at last. Don't 
you consider how much the country is distressed by the 
war ; and that your officers have not been any better paid 
than yourselves ? But we all expect better times, and 
then the country will do us ample justice. Let us all 
stand by one another, then, and fight it out like brave sol- 
diers. Think what a shame it would be for Connecticut 
men to run away from their officers !" 

The General then rode along the line, and was received 
by the several regiments in the usual manner, with pre- 
sented arms and beat of drum. The acting Major of Bri- 
gade was then ordered to give the word for them to shoul- 
der arms, march to their regimental parades, and there 
lodge arms ; all of which was done promptly and with 
apparent good humor. One soldier only, who had been a 
ringleader in the mutiny, was confined in the quarter- 
guard. He attempted to make his escape in the night ; 
but the sentinel, though he had himself taken part in the 
mutiny, was so entirely convinced of his error, and won 
back to his duty, that he shot him dead upon the spot. 

During this season, the British, as usual, sent out an 
occasional foraging party, to sweep away from the unpro- 
tected portion of the country whatever they could find of 
stock or provisions. Unfortunately for their reputation 
for humanity, these parties did not confine themselves to 
this species of justifiable plunder, but burned and laid 



350 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

waste the property of the defenceless. A corps of fifteen 
hundred men, under command of Governor Tryon, was, 
on one of these occasions, approaching the town of West 
Greenwich, more familiarly known as Horseneck^ from a 
peninsula on the Sound, anciently used as a pasture for 
horses, but now the richest and most populous part of the 
township. 

This was one of Putnam's outposts, and he chanced to 
be there, in person, when Tryon advanced. He had no 
force to oppose him but a picket of one hundred and fifty 
men, with two pieces of artillery. With these, he took 
his station on the brow of a steep declivity, near the Pres- 
byterian church, resolved to do the enemy what mischief 
he could and then retire. As they advanced, they receiv- 
ed several well-directed volleys, that told with good effect 
on their line ; upon which the dragoons, supported by a 
corps of infantry, prepared to charge. Putnam immedi- 
ately ordered his men to provide for their own safety, by 
retiring to a swamp inaccessible to cavalry, while he secur- 
ed his, by forcing his well-trained horse, at full speed, 
down the declivity. The road at that time turned to the 
north, a little before it came to the brow of the hill, and, 
after proceeding a considerable distance, bent again with a 
sharp angle towards the south having been dug along the 
steep in such a manner, as to make the passage practica- 
ble and tolerably safe. General Putnam, under the influ- 
ence of the same spirit with which he entered the wolf's 
den, being hard pressed by his pursuers, forced his horse 
directly down the precipice, winding his course, how- 
ever, in such a zig-zag direction, as enabled him to keep 
his feet. His pursuers, when they came to the top of the 
precipice, struck with astonishment at his daring attempt, 
stopped short, and fired upon him as he effected the peril- 
ous descent ; when, despairing of overtaking him by the 




Perilous Descen: at Uotsonsck. Pago 350. 



, 



PERILOUS LEAP AT HORSENECK. 351 

circuitous course of the road, they gave over the chase 
He escaped the sharp firing of his pursuers, only one ball 
taking effect ; and that, fortunately, passed through his 
beaver, without hurting a hair of his head. The road is 
so much altered at the present time as to prevent the eye 
from fully realizing the extent of the hazard. It is now- 
blown through the rocks above at a great expense ; and 
continued by a causeway from the foot of the chasm to the 
valley below, in the very direction where the General 
descended. 

The story of the seventy stone steps, by which this 
hill is ascended, and of the magnificent church on the top, 
to which that wonderful stairway was designed to lead, is 
a sheer fabrication, originating in what Dr. Dwight calls, 
" that mass of folly and falsehood, Peters's History of Con- 
necticut." The. truth is, there is a small Episcopal church 
on the brow of the hill, and the members of the congrega- 
tion, who lived below the hill, being unwilling to take the 
tedious circuit of the road, when walking to the church, 
and being unable to ascend the hill in its original state, 
gathered a collection of stones from the road, and the 
neighboring enclosures, and placed them at convenient 
distances, to aid them in climbing this steep. The num- 
ber is commonly reported to be seventy, though sometimes 
magnified to a hundred ; but, instead of being a magnifi- 
cent flight of steps, the regularity of their arrangement 
would not distinguish them from the common stones of the 
street. 

Putnam continued his route, unmolestedf, to Stamford 
about ten miles. Calling out a party of militia -at this 
place, he returned with all despatch, formed a junction with 
the little band he had left behind, and hung upon the rear 
of Tryon, in his retreat, with such effect, as to take about 
fifty of his party prisoners. Some of these being wounded, 



352 MFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

were treated with such special humanity and kindness, 
that Governor Tryon addressed a handsome note to Put- 
nam in acknowledgment, accompanied with a present of a 
complete suit of clothes.* 

* There is an apparent anachronism in the common narratives of 
this adventure. Colonel Humphreys places it in the winter of 
1 778-9. A note attached to the Boston edition of his memoirs, print- 
ed in 1818, says, that the whole party of prisoners, taken from Tryon, 
on this occasion, was sent, the next day, to the British lines for 
exchange. This could hardly have happened at the time named by 
Humphreys; for Putnam had, a year before, received specific in- 
structions from Washington on this very point. In a letter of the 
25th of January, 1778, after congratulating Putnam on the success of 
his two little parties against the enemy, which he hoped would have 
the effect to prevent their making so extensive excursions in luture, 
he remarks: "One Circumstance I cannot avoid taking notice of, 
that our officers who have been but a very short time in the enemy's 
hands, reap the advantages of any captures which happen to be 
made by us. This must not be practised in future, as it is the height 
of injustice, and will, if continued, draw upon us the censures of the 
officers who have been for a long time suffering all the rigors of a 
severe captivity. The proper mode of procedure is, to deliver them 
into the hands of the commissary of prisoners, who must be best 
acquainted with the propriety of complying with the claims of our 
officers in their hands." It is manifest, therefore, either that the 
whole enterprise is post-dated a whole year by Humphreys, or that 
the Boston editor is in error, in connecting the summary exchange 
of prisoners with this occasion. The former is most probable ; since 
the incident of the suit of clothes received from Governor Tryon, 
which is also mentioned by Humphreys, connects the two events 
together, while Washington's letter, alluding both to the success of Put- 
nam's two parties, and to the premature exchange of prisoners, estab- 
lishing the date of the one, necessarily decides that of the other. It 
will be remembered that, at that period, Putnam sent out three par- 
ties from New Rochellc, against the parties of Tryon, and that two 
of them were successful. The number of prisoners taken by both, as 
represented by Humphreys, was seventy-five. One of those parties 
might have been the party at Horsoneck, increased by the picket to 
<me hundred and fifty men. And, as that part}' took forty prisoner*. 



STONY POINT LOST AND RECOVERED. 353 

In the latter part of March, 1779, before General Put- 
nam received orders to move from his winter quarters at 
Danbury, he was apprized by the Commander-in-chief of 
the probable designs of the enemy to commit extensive 
depredations on the towns along the coast, and warned to 
be on his guard, to prevent their ravages as far as possible. 
But, having the advantage of vastly superior numbers, and 
armed ships, by which they were easily and safely trans- 
ported from place to place, it was not easy to follow or 
check them in their cruel designs. It was expected, by 
the short-sighted administration of that day, that this spe- 
cies of predatory warfare keeping the country in a state 
of constant alarm and suffering would wear out the 
rebellious provinces, and induce them to return to their 
allegiance. The effect was just the reverse, exasperating 
even the timid, and rousing the whne community to an 
indignant and hearty co-operation in sustaining the war. 

As the season for active operations approached, Sir 
Henry Clinton formed a plan for opening the campaign 
with a brilliant coup de main up the North River. Wash- 
ington was immediately informed of the preparations mak- 
ing for this object, and penetrating, at once, their design, 
took measures to counteract them. Generals Putnam and 
McDougall were ordered to hold themselves in readiness 

O 

to march ; and, on the 26th of May, the army under 
Washington moved by divisions from Middlebrook towards 
the Highlands. On the 30th, the British army, command- 
ed by Sir Henry Clinton in person, proceeded up the 
river ; and General Vaughan, at the head of the largest 

it would leave but a slight difference to be adjusted in the two state- 
ments. This is rendered more probable from the circumstance, that, 
in describing the Horseneck expedition, Colonel Humphreys makes 
no mention of prisoners, which, as an honest man, he would not do, 
if he had previously accounted for all the prisoners taken. 
W 



354 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

division, landed, the next morning, near Verplanck's 
Point. The other division, under General Patterson, 
accompanied by Sir Henry, landed on the west side, near 
Stony Point. The works at this place, which were in an 
unfinished state, were, abandoned at once to the enemy. 
The garrison at Fort Lafayette, on the opposite side, con- 
sisting of seventy men, being invested by General Vaughan 
on the land side, and by the galleys on the water side, 
was compelled to surrender as prisoners of war. 

The design of this expedition was evidently to get pos- 
session of West Point, and the river. But, while these 
movements were in progress, that post was so strongly 
reinforced, that it was deemed too hazardous to prosecute 
the design any farther. The whole army, under the im- 
mediate command of Washington, was now concentrated 
in the Highlands. General Putnam, with his division, 
had crossed the river, and joined the main body in the 
Clove. On the 23d of June, General Washington remov- 
ed his head-quarters to New Windsor, leaving the main 
body at the former place, under the immediate command 
of Putnam. 

The two posts on the river, recently taken by the ene- 
my, were important to both parties. The possession of 
them by the British was a great inconvenience to the 
American army, as it cut off one of their best communica- 
tions, by King's Ferry, between their principal posts on 
the two sides of the river, besides affording to the enemy 
convenient vantage ground, from which to advance higher 
up. They were immediately put into a condition of 
defence, and ably garrisoned ; while, at the same time, 
measures were adopted by Washington to recover them. 

On the 15th of July, Stony Point was gallantly stormed 
and recovered by General Wayne, and the whole garrison 
made prisoners consisting of nearly six hundred men. 



WORKS AT WEST POINT. 355 

The attempt upon Verplanck's Point was to have been 
made at the same time. But it failed ; and in consequence 
of this failure, it became necessary to abandon Stony Point 
again to the enemy. It was then more strongly fortified 
and garrisoned than before ; but was again, in a short time, 
with the opposite post at Verplanck's, finally evacuated, 
and left to the quiet possession of the Americans. 

On the 21st of July, Washington established his head- 
quarters at West Point, and remained there until Decem- 
ber, when the army went into winter quarters. It was 
during this period that the strong works at West Point 
and its vicinity were chiefly constructed. During a con- 
siderable part of the time, twenty-five hundred men were 
daily on fatigue duty. The right wing of the army, con- 
sisting of the Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia troops, 
was commanded by General Putnam. His post was at 
Buttermilk Falls, about two miles below West Point. As 
the fatigue parties were furnished alternately by each 
division of the army, and as General Putnam was expe- 
rienced in this department, he took an active and efficient 
part in completing the fortifications which had been laid 
out under his own eye, and the site for which had been 
selected chiefly through his agency. He had the honor of 
giving his own name to the principal fort. It is still to be 
seen, though in ruins, reminding the multitudes who annu- 
ally visit the spot, of the labors, sufferings and sacrifices, 
as well as of the virtues and honors of that noble band of 
heroes, who achieved our Independence. 

With the exception of Wayne's enterprise at Stony 
Point, and another of equal merit, under the gallant Major 
Henry Lee, at Paulus Hook (Jersey City), the campaign 
of 1779 was productive of no important events, so far as 
the main body of the army under Washington was con- 
cerned. That commander, under date of the 30th of Sep- 



356 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

tember, thus characterizes the campaign in a letter to 
Lafayette : " The operations of the enemy have been con- 
fined to the establishment of works of defence, taking a 
post at King's Ferry, and burning the defenceless towns 
of New Haven, Fairfield and Norwalk, on the Sound, 
within reach of their shipping, where little else was, or 
could be opposed to them, than the cries of distressed 
women and helpless children ; but these were offered in 
vain. Since these notable exploits, they have never step- 
ped out of their works, or beyond their lines. How a con- 
duct of this kind is to effect the conquest of America, the 
wisdom of a North, a Germain, or a Sandwich, can best 
decide. It is too deep and refined for the comprehension 
of common understandings, and the general run of poli- 
ticians. "

WHEN the army went into winter quarters at Morristown, 
early in December, General Putnam took leave of absence, 
for a few weeks, and went, with his Aids, to visit his 
family in Connecticut. Before the end of that month, he 
set out on his return to the camp. He had proceeded but 
a few miles, on the way to Hartford, when his progress 
was arrested by an attack of paralysis, by which the use 
of his limbs on one side was temporarily lost. He was 
enabled to reach the house of his friend Colonel Wads- 
worth ; where, unwilling to admit the real character of 
his disease, he endeavored, by active exertion, to shake 
it off. It refused to yield to so simple a remedy, and the 
.old soldier, with a mind wholly unimpaired by his years 
and labors, and a heart warmly devoted to the cause of his 
country, was compelled to submit, for the remainder of his 
days, to a life of comparative inaction. 

General Putnam survived this attack somewhat more 



358 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

than eleven years. He was never so disabled, as to be 
deprived of the power of enjoying moderate exercise in 
walking and riding ; and even in the last year of his life, 
and but a few weeks before he was called away, he tra- 
velled, by slow stages, on horseback, to Danvers, the 
place of his birth, a distance of one hundred miles. With 
his accustomed independence, on arriving at the house 
of his relative, he refused assistance in dismounting, and 
jumped to the ground with something of the agility of 
youth. His mental faculties, his relish for social enjoy- 
ment, his love of pleasantry, and, more than all, his love 
of country, he retained, undiminished, to the last. Few 
men had more or firmer friends, or shared more largely in 
the confidence and respect of those who knew him. 

With the liveliest interest he watched the motions of 
the army, and the progress of public affairs, and maintain- 
ed a free correspondence with the Commander-in-chief, 
and his old comrades in the camp. It would appear that, 
at one time, about six months after his first attack, he 
entertained strong hopes of being able to rejoin the army. 
In reply to a letter, expressing such a hope as this, Gene- 
ral Washington wrote, on the 5th of July, 1780, as fol- 
lows : 

" DEAR SIR : 

" I am very happy to learn from your letter of the 
29th, that the present state of your health is so flattering, 
and that it promises you the prospect of being in a condi- 
tion to make a visit to your old associates some time this 
campaign. I wish it were in my power to congratulate 
you upon a complete recovery. I should feel a sincere 
satisfaction in such an event, and I hope for it heartily, 
with the rest of your friends in this quarter. 
" I am, dear Sir, &c. 

"GEO. WASHINGTON." 



WASHINGTON'S LETTER 259 

Three years after, on the conclusion olF the treaty of 
peace, and the final establishment of American Independ- 
ence, and in response to the heart}' congratulations of 
Putnam on that interesting occasion, the Father of his 
country addressed him in the following affectionate and 
respectful terms The whole letter is in the highest de- 
gree complimentary to his military standing and services, 
and indicates, in terms which cannot be mistaken, the esti- 
mation in which he was held by the writer and his asso- 
ciates. 

" Head Quarters, 2d June, 1783. 
"DEAR SIR: 

" Your favor of the 20th of May I received with 
much pleasure. For I can assure you, that, among the 
many worthy and meritorious officers with whom I have 
had the happiness to be connected in service through the 
course of this war, and from whose cheerful assistance and 
advice I have received much support and confidence, in 
the various and trying vicissitudes of a complicated con- 
test, the name of Putnam is not forgotten ; nor will be 
but with that stroke of time, which shall obliterate from 
my mind the remembrance of all those toils and fatigues, 
through which we have struggled, for the preservation and 
establishment of the Rights, Liberties, and Independence 
of our Country. 

" Your congratulations on the happy prospects of our 
peace and independent security, with their attendant bless- 
ings to the UNITED STATES, I receive with great satisfac- 
tion ; and beg that you will accept a return of my gratula- 
tions to you on this auspicious event an even.,, in which, 
great as it is in itself, and glorious as it will probably be 
in its consequences, you have a right to participate largely, 
from the distinguished part you have contributed towards 
its attainment 



360 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

" But while I contemplate, the greatness of the object 
for which we have contended, and felicitate you on the 
happy issue of our toils and labors, which have terminated 
with such general satisfaction, I lament that vou should 
feel the ungrateful returns of a country in whose service 
you have exhausted your bodily health, and expended the 
vigor of a youthful constitution. I wish, however, that 
your expectations of returning sentiments of liberality may 
be verified, I have a hope that they may but should 
they not, your career will not he a singular one. Ingrati- 
tude has been experienced in all ages ; and Republics, in 
particular, have ever been famed for the exercise of that 
unnatural and sordid vice. 

" The SECRETARY AT WAR, who is now here, informs 
me that you have been considered as entitled to full pay 
since your absence from the field, and that you will still 
be considered in that light till the close of the war ; at 
which period you will be equally entitled to the same 
emoluments of half-pay, or commutation, as other officers 
of your rank. The same opinion is also given by the 
Paymaster-General, who is now with the army, empow- 
ered by Mr. Morris for the settlement of all their accounts, 
and who will attend to yours, whenever you shall think 
proper to send on for that purpose, which it will probably 
be best for you to do in a short time. 

" I anticipate, with pleasure, the day and that I trust 
not far off when I shall quit the busy scenes of a military 
employment, and retire to the more tranquil walks of 
domestic life. In that, or whatever other situation Provi- 
dence may dispose of my future days, the remembrance of 
the many friendships and connections I have had the hap- 
piness to contract with the (jentlemen of the Army, will be 
one of my most grateful reflections. Under this contem- 
plation^ and impressed with the sentiments of benevolence

That the old veteran was a good citizen, as well as a 
brave soldier and an able officer, and, in retiring from the 
army, did not lose sight of the interests of society around 
him, will appear from the following letter ; which will 
commend itself especially to the Washingtonians, Recha- 
bites, and other temperance reformers of the day. Though 
it does not come up to the standard of this te total age, it 
was certainly in advance of the age in which he lived

*' GENTLEMEN : 

" Being an enemy to Idleness, Dissipation and Intem- 
perance, I would object against any measures which may 
be conducive thereto ; and, the multiplying of public 
houses, where the public good does not require it, has a 
direct tendency f o ruin the morals of youth, and promote 
idleness and intemperance among all ranks of people, espe- 
cially as the grand object of the candidates for licenses is 
money ; and, when that is not the case, men are not over 
apt to be tender of people's morals or purses. The au 
thorities of this town, I think, have run into a great error 
in approbating an additional number of public houses 
especially in this parish. They have approbated two 
houses in the centre, where there never was custom ( 
mean travelling custom) enough for one. The other cus

torn (the domestic) I have been informed, has, of late 
years, increased ; and the licensing another house, 1 fear, 
would increase it more. As I kept a public house here 
myself, a number of years before the war, J had an oppor- 
tunity of knowing, and certainly do know, that the travel- 
ling custom is too trifling for a man to lay himself out sc 
as to keep such a house as travellers have a right to ex- 
pect. Therefore, I hope your Honors will consult the 
good of this parish, so as to license only one of the two 
houses. I shall not undertake to say which ought to be 
licensed. Your Honors will act according to your best 
information.

" To the Honorable County Court, to be holden at 
Windham, on the 19th instant." 

Though he had passed so great a portion of his life in 
the camp, amidst the demoralizing influences and false 
maxims which prevail in that arbitrary and unnatural 
state of society, General Putnam, with one exception only, 
maintained a high standard of moral virtue. During most 
of his military life, he was addicted to the soldier's habit 
of profaneness ; and most of the anecdotes related of him, 
are freely interlarded with oaths. This sin he acknow- 
ledged, lamented, and wholly abjured in his later years. 
To duelling, that worst and most heartless species of legal- 
ized murder, he was always and utterly opposed holding 
in hearty abhorrence every principle of the so-called code 
of honor. It was a practice which few men could better 
afford to hold in supreme contempt ; for his courage was 
above suspicion. 

It once happened that, without intending an insult, he 



HIS VIEWS OF DUELLING. 363 

grossly offended a brother officer. The dispute arose at a 
wine table, and the officer demanded instant reparation. 
Putnam, being a little excited, expressed his willingness 
to accommodate the gentleman with a fight ; and it was 
stipulated that the duel should take place on the following 
morning, and that they should fight without seconds. At 
the appointed time, the officer went to the ground, 
armed with sword and pistols. On entering the field, 
Putnam, who had taken a stand at the opposite extremity, 
and at a distance of thirty rods, levelled his musket, and 
fired at him. The gentleman now ran toward his antago- 
nist, who deliberately proceeded to reload his gun. 

" What are you about to do ?" exclaimed he. " Is this 
the conduct of an American officer, and a man of honor ?" 

" What am I about to do ?" exclaimed the General, 
attending only to the first question. " A pretty question 
to put to a man whom you intended to murder ! I'm 
about to kill you ; and if you don't beat a retreat in less 
time than 'twould take old Heath to hang a tory, you are 
a gone dog ;" at the same time returning his ramrod to its 
place, and throwing the breach of his gun into the hollow 
of his shoulder. 

This intimation was too unequivocal to be misunder- 
stood ; and the valorous duellist turned and fled for dear 
life. 

An English officer, who was a prisoner on his parole, 
being offended at some remarks of General Putnam, in 
which he had reflected with some severity upon the cha- 
racter of the British, demanded satisfaction, as for a per- 
sonal insult. Putnam accepted the challenge, and having 
his choice of the weapons, agreed to meet his antagonist 
the next morning, at a certain place which he named, pre- 
pared with arms for both parties. On the arrival of the 
Englishman at the appointed place, he found Putnam seat- 



364 LIFE OF GENERAL PDTNAM. 

ed by the side of what appeared to be a barrel of powder, 
smoking his pipe a common match being inserted into a 
small opening in the top of the barrel. Requesting the 
Englishman to sit down on the other side of the cask, he 
set fire to the match with his pipe, and coolly remarking 
that there was an equal chance for both of them, went on 
with his smoking. The Englishman watched the match, 
for a moment, as the fire crept slowly down towards the 
powder, and then starting hastily up, made a precipitate 
retreat. 

" You are just as brave a man as I took you to be," 
said Putnam. " This is nothing but a barrel of onions, 
with a few grains of powder on the head, to try you by. 
But you don't like the smell." 

In following out the tableaux vivants of history, we are 
so often compelled to leave our chosen hero weltering in 
his blood on an untimely field, or wearing away the prime 
of his days in captivity, that we take unusual satisfaction 
in contemplating the long evening of calm -and dignified 
repose, that closed the active and adventurous career of 
Putnam. Though incapacitated for further service in the 
stirring scenes of the camp and the field, he retained, in 
full vigor, his power to enjoy and promote the tranquil 
pleasures of social life. Fortunately, the thrift and indus- 
try of his early years, and the prudent management of his 
temporal affairs, had secured an ample competency for his 
declining years, and placed him above that painful and 
humiliating embarrassment, which embittered the last days 
of so many of his worthy compeers in that glorious strug- 
gle. In a pleasant home, which his own industry had 
procured and adorned ; in the midst of a kind and affec- 
tionate family, happy in themselves and in him ; and of a 
free and prosperous people, who looked up to and vene- 



HIS CHARACTER. 365 

rated 1 im, as one of the authors of their freedom and 
prosperity ; with a wide circle of .admiring and confiding 
friends among the best and worthiest in the land ; and in 
the cheerful, conscientious performance of all the duties 
of a kind father, a faithful friend, a good neighbor, a wor 
thy citizen, a high-minded patriot, and a devout Christian, 
he diligently improved his long furlough from the scenes 
of earthly strife and toil, in maintaining a spiritual warfare 
against inward foes, and preparing for a spiritual rest. 

The narrative of his adventurous life sufficiently illus- 
trates his martial virtues, his intrepid bravery, and con- 
summate skill, and his humane and generous regard for 
the unfortunate victims of war. " But," as Mr. Peabody 
beautifully and justly remarks, " his military reputation, 
high as it was, concealed no dark traits of personal cha- 
racter beneath its shadow. In all the domestic relations, 
the surest test of habitual virtue, he was most exemplary ; 
and his excellence in this respect deserves the more notice, 
as the stern discipline and wild adventure, in which so 
much of his life was spent, were more favorable to the 
growth of severer qualities. His disposition was frank, 
generous and kind ; in his intercourse with others, he was 
open, just, sincere and unsuspecting ; liberal in his hospi- 
tality, and of ready benevolence, wherever there was occa- 
sion for his charity. Those who knew him best were the 
most forward to express their admiration of his excel- 
lence." 

'Dr. Dwight, who was personally and intimately ac- 
quainted with him, in private as well as public life, bears 
this testimony to his character. 

" With only the advantages of a domestic education, in 
a plain farmer's family, and the usual instruction of a 
common parish school, he raised himself from the man- 
agement of a farm, to the command of a regiment, in the 



366 LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM. 

last Canadian War ; and in the Revolutionary War, to the 
second command in the armies of the United States. To 
these stations he rose, solely by his own efforts, directed 
steadily to the benefit of his country, and with the cheer- 
ful, as well as united, suffrages of his countrymen. 

" Every employment in which he engaged, he filled 
with reputation. In the private circles of life, as a hus- 
band, father, friend and companion, he was alike respected 
and beloved. In his manners, though somewhat more 
direct and blunt than those of most persons who have 
received an early, polished education, he was gentlemanly, 
and very agreeable. In his disposition he was sincere, 
tender-hearted, generous, and noble. It is not known that 
the passion of fear ever found a place in his breast. His 
word was regarded as ample security for anything, for 
which it was pledged ; and his uprightness commanded 
absolute confidence. His intellect was vigorous ; and his 
wit pungent, yet pleasant and sportive. The principal 
part of his improvements, however, were derived from his 
own observation, and his correspondence with the affairs 
of men. During the gayest and most thoughtless period 
of his life, he still regarded Religion with profound reve- 
rence, and read the Scriptures with the deepest veneration. 
On the public worship of God he was a regular and very 
respectful attendant. In the decline of life, he publicly 
professed the religion of the Gospel ; and in the opinion 
of the respectable clergyman of Brooklyn, the Rev. Dr. 
Whitney, from whose mouth I received <the information, 
died hopefully a Christian." 

Dr. Whitney, in a sermon preached immediately after 
General Putnam's death, says : " He was eminently a 
person of public spirit, an unshaken friend of liberty, and 
was proof against attempts to induce him to betray arid 
desert his country. The baits to do so were rejected with 



HIS DEATH. 367 

the utmost abhorrence. He was of a kind, benevolent 
disposition ; pitiful to the distressed, charitable to the 
needy, and ready to assist all who wanted his help. In 
his family he was the tender, affectionate husband, the 
provident father, an example of industry and close appli- 
cation to business. He was a constant attendant upon the 
public-worship of God, from his youth up. He brought 
his family with him, when he came to worship the Lord. 
He was not ashamed of family religion. His house was a 
house of prayer. For many years he was a professor of 
religion. In the last years of his life, he often expressed 
a great regard for God, and the things of God. There is 
one, at least, to whom he freely disclosed the workings of 
his mind his conviction of sin his grief for it his de- 
pendence on God, through the Redeemer, for pardon and 
his hope of a future happy existence, whenever his 
strength and heart should fail him. This one makes men 

O 

tion of these things, for the satisfaction and comfort of his 
children and friends ; and can add, that, being with the 
General a little before he died, he asked him whether his 
hope of future happiness, as formerly expressed, now 
attended him. His answer was in the affirmative ; with a 
declaration of his resignation to the will of God, and his 
willingness even then to die." 

In this hope, and in the full possession of his faculties to 
the last, he died, on the 19th of May, 1790, in the seven- 
ty-third year of his age. He was borne to his grave with 
the martial honors usually accorded to a brave and patri- 
otic soldier. His death was noticed, with every mark of 
respect, in the public prints ; while the people, as they 
met, said one to another, " Know ye not that there is a 
Prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel ?" 

His tomb bears ihe following inscription, from the pec 
and heart of his friend Dr. D wight :

NUMBER I. 

MAJOR ROGERS. 

THE story of Major Rogers, as far as it relates to the War of the 
Revolution, is furnished in the following extracts from the letters of 
General Washington, and the notes attached to them in Sparks' 
edition of his Writings. 

" To MAJOR-GENERAL SCHCYLER. 

" Cambridge, \Sth December, J775. 

" In a letter from Rev. Dr. Wheelock, of Dartmouth College, of 
the 2d instant, I had the following intelligence : ' That the day be- 
fore, two soldiers returning from Montreal informed him, that our 
officers were assured by a Frenchman (a captain of the artillery 
whom they had taken captive), that Major Rogers was second in 
command under General Carleton, and that he had been, in an Indian 
habit, through our encampment at St. John's. You will be pleased 
to have this report examined into, and acquaint me as to the authen- 
ticity or probability of the truth of it. If any circumstances can be 
discovered to induce a belief that he was there, he should be appre- 
hended. He is now in this government." * * * 

Note by Dr. Sparks. " Major Rogers had been celebrated for his 
adventures and feats of valor in the French War, as the companion 
of Putnam and Stark. He wrote a journal of those events, which is 
not without ability and interest. He was once Governor of Michili- 
mackinac. After the peace, he lived in New Hampshire, and con- 
tinued an officer on half-pay. Dr. Wheelock's letter, from which the 
above is an extract, contains some other curious particulars about 
aim j whether true or fabulous, the reader must judge. 
X 



370 APPENDIX. 

" On the 13th ultimo," says Dr. Wheelock, " the famous Major 
Rogers came to my house, from a tavern in the neighborhood where 
he called for refreshment. I had never seen him before. He was in. 
but an ordinary habit, for one of his character. He treated me with 
great respect ; said he came from London in July, and had spent 
twenty days with the Congress in Philadelphia, and I forget how- 
many at New York ; had been offered and urged to take a com- 
mission in favor of the colonies, but, as he was now on half-pay 
from the crown, he thought proper not to accept it ; that he had fought 
two battles in Algiers under the Dey ; that he was now on a design to 
take care of some large grants of land made to him ; that he was 
going to visit his sister at Moor's Town, and then to return by Mer- 
rimac River to visit his wife, whom he had not yet seen since his 
return from England ; that he had got a pass, or license to travel, 
from the Continental Congress; that he called to offer his services to 
procure a large interest for this college; that its reputation was great 
in England; that Lord Dartmouth, and many other noblemen, had 
spoken of it in his hearing, with expressions of the highest esteem 
and respect; that Captain Holland, surveyor-general, now at New 
York, was a great friend to me, and the college, and would assist me 
in the affair ; and that now was the most favorable time to apply for 
large grants of land for it. 

" I thanked him for these expressions of his kindness; but, after I 
had shown some coldness in accepting it, he proposed to write to me 
on his journey, and let me know where I might reply to hiui ; and he 
should be ready to perform any friendly office in the affair. He said 
k* was in haste to pursue his journey that evening." 

" About a month after visiting Dr. Wheelock, the Major appeared 
at Medford, near the camp, and wrote to General Washington, 
requesting him to sign a certificate, permitting him to travel unmo- 
lested in the country. Such a certificate, or permit, had first been 
granted by the Committee of Safety in Philadelphia; who, from sus- 
picious circumstances, and because he was actually a British officer, 
had made him a prisoner, when he arrived in that place from Eng- 
land. The certificate was furnished to him, in consequence of a 
parole, wherein he ' solemnly promised and engaged, on the honor 
of a gentleman and a soldier, that he would not bear arms against the 
American United Colonies in any manner whatsoever, during the 
American contest with Great Britain :' and, in his letter to Washing- 
tori, he says, 'I love America; it is my native country and that of 
my family, aud i intend to spend the evening of my days in it.' 



APPENDIX. 371 

"These professions being apparently sincere, Washington sent 
General Sullivan to examine him on certain points, and report the 
result. He owned the accuracy of Dr. Wheelock's letter, except the 
part relating to Canada, which he denied though he had been to the 
west of Albany. As no good reason appeared, why he came to camp, 
or why he wished to travel through the country, the General did not 
think it expedient to receive a visit from him, nor to sign his permit ; 
but, as this had already been signed by the President of the New 
York Congress, and the Chairman of the New Hampshire Commit- 
tee of Safety, he suffered the Major to depart at his option, and to 
enjoy such security as his papers, thus authenticated, might procure 
him. 

" There was a suspicion, strengthened by his subsequent conduct, 
that he v/as at this time a spy, or at least practising a very unworthy 
artifice for acquiring a confidence, to which his political sentiments 
did not entitle him. Be this as it may, he soon after joined the ene- 
my's ranks, and was raised to be a colonel in the British army, not- 
withstanding his paiole of honor, and his love of America. It may 
be said, perhaps, in extenuation, that he considered his parole ex- 
torted from him at a time when there were no just grounds for ques- 
tioning his motives, and by an authority which he did not feel bound 
to respect." Vol. Hi., p. 208. 

The " subsequent conduct " referred to above, as calculated to 
awaken suspicions, may be illustrated by the following extract from 
a letter of General Washington to the President of Congress, dated 
New York, June 27, 1776 : 

" Upon information that Major Rogers was travelling through the 
country under suspicious circumstances, I thought it necessary to 
have him secured. I, therefore, sent after him. He was taken at 
South Amboy, and brought up to New York. Upon examination, 
he informed me that he came from New Hampshire, the country of 
his usual abode, where he had left his family ; and pretended he 
was destined to Philadelphia on business with Congress. 

" As, by his own confession, he had crossed Hudson's River at 
New Windsor, and was taken so far out of his proper and direct 
route to Philadelphia, this consideration, added to the length of time 
he had taken to perform his journey, his being found in so suspicious 
a place as Amboy,* his unnecessary stay there, on pretence of get- 
ting some baggage from New York, and an expectation of receiving

Island.

money from a person here of bad character, and in no circumstances 
to furnish him out of his own stock, the Major's reputation, and his 
being a half-pay officer, have increased my jealousies about him. 
The business which he informs me he has with Congress, is a secret 
offer of his services, to the end that, in case it should be rejected, he 
might have his way left open to an employment in the East Indies, 
to which he is assigned ; and in that case, he flatters himself he will 
obtain leave of Congress to go to Great Britain. 

" As he had been put upon his parole by Congress, I thought it 
would be improper to stay his progress to Philadelphia, should he be 
in fact destined thither. I, therefore, send him forward, but, to pre- 
vent imposition, under the care of an officer, with letters found upon 
him, which, from their tenor, seem calculated to recommend him to 
Congress. I submit it to their consideration, whether it would not 
be dangi;rous to accept the offer of his services." 

Nule by Dr. Sparks. " Congress directed, that Major Rogers 
should be sent to New Hampshire, to be disposed of as the govern- 
ment of that Province should judge best. He soon afterwards went 
over to the British." Vol. Hi., p. 439. 

In September following, Major Rogers was found actively employ- 
ed in the British service, and against the American interests, not- 
withstanding his parole, and his love of America. He had aban- 
doned his position in the East Indies, if he ever had any, and was 
engaged in drumming up British recruits, from among the American 
lories on Long Island. The following, from a letter of Washington 
to Governor Trumbull, of Connecticut, establishes this fact. 

" Haerlem, 3(MA September, 1776. 

" Having received authentic advices from Long Island, that the 
enemy are recruiting a great number of men * * * I have directed 
* an expedition to the island, to check and suppress, if possible, a 
practice so injurious to our cause. * * * The influence of their 
money and their artifices, has already passed the Sound, and several 
persons have been detected of late, who have enlisted to serve under 
their banner, and the particular command of Major Rogers." 

Governor Trumbull, in writing to Colonel Livingston on the sub- 
ject, says : t; I have received intelligence, which I believe may be 
depended on, that Major Rogers, now employed by General Howe, 
and who you know was a famous partizan, or ranger, in the last 
war, is collecting a battalion of lories on Long Island and from the 
main, many of whom have joined him at Huntington, and that he

take the continental stores, and lay waste the town. I hope we shall 
.be able to frustrate his designs. I have no need to apprise you of the 
art of this Rogers. He has been a famous scouter, or woods-hunter, 
skilled in waylaying, ambuscade, and sudden attack." Vol. iv., 
page 128! 

Major Rogers, on his return to the British camp, was immediately 
promoted to the rank of a Colonel, with the command of a regiment 
of loyalists, called the Queen's Rangers. General Howe wrote, on 
liie Cth August, " Major Rogers, having escaped to us from Philadcl- 
f4/a, is empowered to raise a battalion of rangers, which, I hope, 
floay be useful in the course of the campaign." The following is a, 
topy of enlisting orders, sent out by him : 

" Valentine' 's Hill, 30 December, 1776. 

" Whereas his Majesty's service makes it absolutely necessary that 
recruits should be raised, this is to certify that Mr. Daniel Strang. or 
any other gentleman, who may bring in recruit*, shall have commis- 
sions, according to the number he or they shall bring in for the 
dueen's American Rangers. No more than forty shillings bounty is 
to be given to any man, which is to be applied towards purchasing 
necessaries ; to serve during the present REBELLION, and no longer. 
They will luive their proportion of aU REBEL lands, and all privileges 
iqual to any of his Majesty's troops. The officers are to be the best 
judges in what manner they will get their men in, either by parties, 
letachments, or otherwise, as may seem most advantageous ; which 
oen are to be attested before the first magistrate within the British 
ines. 

"ROBERT ROGERS, 
" Lieutenant- Colonel Commandant of the Queen's Rangers. 

" Strang, who had the above paper in his possession, was taken up 
near the American camp, at Peekskill. He was tried by a court- 
martial, and making no defence, was condemned to suffer death, on 
the charge of holding correspondence with the enemy, and lurking 
round the camp as a spy. General Washington approved the sen- 
tence. But, notwithstanding this rigor, and the danger of the service 
beyond the enemy's lines, yet persons were found to in engage it, who 
met with some success, though much less than had been anticipated 
by General Howe. Recruits for the British provincial regiments 
were raised, even as high up the North River as Dutchess county, 
and Livingston's Manor. The Island of New York, Long Island, Sta-

ten Island, and a large part of Westchester county, were wholly sub- 
ject to tlie power of the enemy ; and, as these were populous districts, 
they doubtless afforded the chief portion of the provincial troops, en- 
listed into the king's service, while General Howe's head-quarters 
were in New York." V-)l. iv., page 521. 

Near the end of October, Colonel Haslet was despatched, with 
seven hundred and fifty men, by order of Lord Stirling, " to attack 
the enemy's outposts at Mamaroneck ; which was done, and their 
guards forced. We brought in thirty-six prisoners, a pair of colors, 
sixty stand of arms, and a variety of other plunder besides. The 
party we fell in with was Colmicl fingers, the late worthless Major. 
On the first fire, he skulked off in the dark. His lieutenant, and a 
number of others, were left dead on the spot. Had not our guards 
deserted on the first outset, he and his whole party must have been 
taken." P"-ge 52(3. 

In November, General Lee ft rmed a plan for attacking and carry- 
ing off Rogers, at a moment when he was ordered by General Wash- 
ington to move in another direction. It was while aiming to accom- 
plish this object, that he was surprised by Colonel Harcourt, and 
carried to Brunswick, a prisoner of war. 



NUMBER II. 

THE BATTLE OP BDNKER HILL. 

COLONEL SWETT'S admirable, and ably fortified sketch of this great 
battle, which, to use the language of the Christian Examiner, " is 
now classical authority on the subject" which Bradford refers to, as 
" the most correct and perfect account which has been given" and 
which the Boston Courier cites, as " one of the most valuable and au- 
thentic records connected with the History of the Revolution" would 
seem to have put for ever at rest, the question of the presence and 
active services of General Putnam, on that memorable occasion. 
The ample notes appended to the third edition of that sketch, furnish 
an amount and variety of testimony that is absolutely overwhelming. 
Referring to them, I take leave to add, in this place, a few more of 
the same character, which have been kindly furnished by several 
friendly correspondents not because they are necessary to establish 
the point in dispute, but just to preserve them from oblivion. 

" I, Sylvanus Conant, of Mansfield, in the County of Tolland ana 
State of Connecticut, testify and say, that I am now in my ninety- 
second yeax; that I was a soldier in the Revolutionary War; that I 
was in the battle of Bunker's Hill, on the seventeenth day of June, 
1775 ; that I was acquainted with General Israel Putnam, of Con- 
necticut, and know that he was in the battle. Saw him at the com- 
mencement of the battle, riding about the hill, and giving orders to 
the troops, and heard him sharply reproving a soldier for cowardice, 
or neglect of duty ; and was told by others, though this I did not see 
myself, that near the close of the battle, General Putnam, seeing a 
field-piece deserted by the company, dismounted from his horse and 
tired the piece once or twice with his own hands, and then remount- 
<d his horse, and rode off the hill with the retreating troops.

376 APPENDIX. 

[From the Mercantile Journal, Boston.} 

"MR. SLEEPER, Dear Sir: I understand from the public papers, 
that Mr. Bancroft stated in a late lecture before the Charlestown 
Lyceum, that he found no evidence to prove that General Putnam 
had the chief command in the battle of Bunker Hill, or even took any 
part in the engagement. For his information and that of the public, 
please give currency, through your journal, to the following facts, 
which I lately obtained from Major John Burnham, of this town. 
Major Burnham, I would remark, is a Revolutionary soldier and. 
officer; is in his ninety-fourth year, and yet retains his mental facul- 
ties in a wonderful manner. He is a very worthy man, and a 
humble disciple of Christ. I assure you the most implicit confidence 
can be placed in his statements. 

" I paid him a visit the other day, and he informed me that he took 
an active part in that ever memorable engagement of the 1 7th of 
June ; that he was lieutenant of a company from Gloucester, com- 
manded by Captain Warner ; that he arrived on the battle-ground a 
few minutes before the firing commenced; that his Captain was 
met by General Putnam and directed where to go; that he fre- 
quently saw the General, riding among the troops and giving orders ; 
that he never knew or heard, at the time of the battle, of any other 
individual taking the chief command but General Putnam ; and that 
he has no more doubt of the fact than he has of his own existence. 
Such is the testimony of one who had the best possible means of 
knowing the truth of his statements. 

"A. F. H. 
" Derry, January 21th, 1843." 

Letter of H. Burbeck, now upwards of ninety years old, to C. S. 
Davies, Esq., of Portland, Me. : 

"Figure to yourself a man of sixty six feet high and somewhat 
round-shouldered; sun-burnt from exposure; with coarse leather 
shoes, and blue stockings; coarse homespun small-clothes, a red 
Vaistcoat, and calico ' Banian ' (answering to the sack worn at the 
present day), a three-cornered hat, with a red cockade, and a bande- 
lier, or belt, with a sword hung high up under the left arm. You 
will say that it is a complete caricature but such was the fact, and 
such the dress of the Heroes, who fought at the Battle of Bunker 
Hill. 

" On that day, General Putnam rode between Charlestown and 
Cambridge without a coat, in his shirt sleeves, aud an old white iett 



APPENDIX. 377 

hat on, to report to General "Ward, and to consult upon further opera- 
tions. I never understood that he was in the engagement, but was 
very active in forwarding troops, ammunition, &c. In short, he was 
the great gun of the day. Colonels Prescott and Stark were warmly 
engaged in the battle ; but General Putnam forwarded the materials 
to them, to support the action. For that reason he is justly entitled to 
equal praise and honor on that eventful day, for without his assist- 
ance nothing would have been done. 

"H. BURBECK." 

It is not surprising that there should be differences of opinion, in 
relation to the nature of Putnam's command, among the multitude of 
irregular troops collected on that day. The greater part of them 
were ready to obey the orders of any one in whom they had confi- 
dence, and did pot stoop to ask if he was regularly invested with the 
command by the proper authorities. The officers were equally ready 
to take command*, where they could render good service by doing so. 
The only matter of surprise is, that any should have been found, who 
were willing to deny that Putnam was on the field at all, because 
they did not happen to see him, at particular times and places. It is 
probable that most of the soldiers, if they were true to their own 
duty, had other and more absorbing employment, than taking notes 
of the proceedings of their commanders, with a view to calling them 
to account for their conduct. The field was an irregular one. The 
action was in all parts of it, and it was impossible for any one to 
say who was, or was not, present at any particular time, except m 
the immediate vicinity of his own post. And even then, amid the 
smoke, and din, and confusion of battle, an officer might have pass- 
ed and repassed many times, and ordered some of the most important 
movements of the day, without being noticed, or even seen, by one 
in ten of the soldiers. 

In all such cases as this, it is manifest, that testimony of a merely 
negative character can have no weight at all against that which is 
positive. The evidence of one competent witness, testifying that he 
saw General Putnam in the heat of the engagement, discharging the 
duty of a brave and able commander, would be allowed, in any court 
of justice, to overbalance that of any number, who could only say 
they did not see him. The amount and character of positive testi- 
mony to this point, furnished by Colonel Swell's notes, is such as 
should satisfy the most determined skeptic. 

With reference to the same point, Dr. Dwight says : " It is not so 



378 APPENDIX 

extensively known, as it ought to be, that Genera, Putnam command- 
ed the American forces at the Battle of Breed's Hill ; and that, to 
his courage and conduct, the United States are particularly indebted 
for the advantages of that day;' one of the most brilliant in the annals 
Of this country." 

The following is a note to Rev. Dr. Whitney's sermon on the 
death of General Putnam. 



" The friends of the late General Putnam feel themselves not a 
little obliged to his worthy and respectable biographer, for giving to 
the public the distinguishing features in the General's character, and 
the memorable actions of his life ; yet wish that a more perfect and 
just account had been given of the Battle of Bunker's Hill, so far as 
General Putnam was concerned in it. In page 107 of his life, are 
the following words : ' The provincial Generals having received 
advice that the British Commander-in-chief designed to take posses- 
sion of the heights on the peninsula of Charlestown, detached a thou- 
sand men, in the night of the 16th of June, under the orders of Gene- 
ral Warren, to intrench themselves upon one of those eminenr.es:' 
and on page 110: 'In this battle, the presence and example of Gene- 
ral Putnam, who arrived with the reinforcements, were not less con- 
spicuous than useful.' 

" From the first of these passages, the reader is led to conclude, 
that the detachment was first put under the orders of General War- 
ren ; from the second, that General Putnam came to General War- 
ren's aid, with a reinforcement. The true state of the case was this. 
The detachment at first was put under the command of General 
Putnam. With it he took possession of the hill, and ordered the 
battle from the beginning to the end. General Warren (one of the 
most illustrious patriots) arrived alone on the hill, and as a volun- 
teer joined the. Americans just as the action commenced ; and within 
ho If an hour, received a mortal wound, while he was waxing valiant 
in battle, and soon expired. These facts General Putnam himself 
gave me, soon after the battle, and also repeated them to me after his 
life was printed. Colonel Humphreys, page 109, justly observes : 
'Few instances can be produced, in the annals of mankind, where 
soldiers who have never before faced an enemy, or heard the whis- 
tling of a ball, behaved with such deliberate an i persevering valor.' 
The General who encouraged and animated them by his words and

example to prodigies of bravery, is highly to be honored, and the 
praise not given to another, however meritorious in other respects. 
Other evidence to confirm what I have said here, I am able to pro- 
duce, if any should call for it." 

Extract from a letter, written by an officer in the British army, at 
Boston, to his friend in England, dated 25 June, 1775 : 

" After the skirmish of the 17th, we even commended the troops of 
Putnam, who fought so gallantly pro arts etfocis. When we marched 
to attack their redoubt, they called out, " General Abercrombie, are 
the Yankees cowards 1" nor did they discharge a gun until we were 
within fifteen yards. The fire on our left wing was so hot, that cur 
troops broke. * * * So very secretly was the action conducted, 
that Generals Clinton and Burgoyne knew nothing of it till the morn- 
ing. The town did in general, and Putnam in particular. This 
man served under Prussia, and does honor to his master. He is 63, 
and brave to the back-bone." Am. Archives, 4fA Scries^vol. ii., page 
1092. 

Putnam was at this time in his fifty-eighth year, and had never 
seen Prussia. It is possible that one of the distinguished men, under 
whom he served in the French war, may have been familiarly desig- 
nated by this title. None of the American officers, of that period, 
had seen foreign service. General Lee was not then with the army, 
nor was he known by the English to have accepted a continental 
commission. These inaccuracies, however they may be explained, do 
not invalidate the evidence here furnished, that Putnam was active 
and prominent in that engagement, and that his military character 
was held in the highest estimation by his old commanders and com- 
rades of the British aimy. 

Sandford, who published his history within a year after the first 
appearance of the article, in which Putnam's position and conduct 
in this battle were called in question, has the following remarks, at 
page 291 et seq. : 

"It has been recently discovered, that 'Old Put ' was a coward. 
So stupid a calumny could only have found place in the pages of a 
stupid journal ; and a short review of that soldier's life, during the 
period in which this new trait is said to have displayed itself, will 
show, at least, that, if he was a coward, he was a coward to some 
purpose. The news from Lexington found him working at ston* 



380 APPENDIX. 

fence, in his leathern frock and apron. He immediately mounted 
his horse, to spread the intelligence through the adjoining towns; 
and, when he returned to make a little preparation for the march, a 
body of several hundred of persons, already under arms, appointed 
him their commander. He ordered them to march with a quick 
step ; and, setting off himself, in his check-shirt, arrived at Concord 
by sun-rise next morning. 

" Men, who were stationed at one particular spot, in the battle of 
Bunker's Hill, pretend to trace the movements of General Putnam; 
and have charged him with a fear of powder and ball, for being seen 
once in a particular situation, when, in fact, he was at different times 
in every part of the field. It may be true, that the army was not 
under ai-y general, who had been regularly commissioned ; but it is 
equally true, that Putnam discharged the duties, though he might 
not have held the diploma, of a commander-in-chief. ' General 
Warren joins the Massachusetts forces in one place,' says Hubley ; 
'and General Pomeroy in another, whilst General Putnam was bu- 
sily engaged in aiding and encouraging here and there as required.' 
Since he was the most experienced, and had not yet shown himself a 
coward, it was natural that the other two generals should give him 
the precedence ; and we know not that the historian could have 
chosen language more pointedly expressive of the conduct which a 
brave commander is always found to adopt. That Putnam was, at 
one time, seen with entrenching tools before him, we would rather 
admit than deny. It might have been necessary to carry them from 
one part of the works to another: the length of the redoubt was 
eighty rods : a man, who had come from making stone-fence, was 
not likely to shrink from a spade or a pick-axe ; and, since the 
sooner they were carried the better, we think nothing more probable 
than that Putnam, being on horseback, took a part of them him- 
self. 

" It was not Colonel Gerrish alone, who was tried for cowardice 
at the battle of Bunker's Hill. The colonists had not yet been sepa- 
rated from England long enough to distinguish, with certainty, the 
friends from the foes : the conduct of every individual was watched 
with the strictest scrutiny ; and court martials continued to be held 
upon officers and men, from the 7th of July to the 5th of October. 
The same rigor was extended to the camp. Offences, which would 
now be overlooked, were then punished with severity. One captain 
was fined eight shillings for two oaths ; and a private received twenty 
abusing Colonel Gridley, and foigiug Putnam's order for 



APPENDIX. 381 

a quart of rum. If Putnam himself was a coward, he was certainly 
a most conspicuous coward. Had he dodged, or turned pale, there 
was not an officer or a man in the army, who would not have been 
a witness to the fact. 

" On the 22d of July, 1775, the army was marshalled into three 
divisions ; and it is a remarkable instance of successful cowardice, 
that the left wing was given to Major-General Putnam. Indeed, so 
little waa his character known, at this time, that, when General 
Washington, early in 1776, had formed a bold and hazardous plan' 
of taking Boston by storm, he designated Putnam for his leader, 
though he was youngest, in rank, of four major-generals. ' In ex- ' 
pectation,' says Marshal, ' that the flower of the British troops would 
be employed against the heights of Dorchester, General Washington 
had concerted a plan for availing himself of that occasion, to attack 
the town of Boston itself. Four thousand chosen men were held in 
readiness to embark at the mouth of Cambridge river, on a signal to 
be given, if the garrison should appear to be so weakened by the 
detachment from it, as to justify an assault. These troops were to 
embark in two divisions ; the first to be led by Brigadier-General 
Sullivan ; the second, by Brigadier-General Green ; and the whole 
to be under the command of Major-General Putnam.' In fine, a 
lack of courage was the last accusation which could be expected to 
succeed against General Putnam ; and, until a man has voluntarily 
descended to fight a wolf in her own den, let him never think him- 
self entitled to call the hero of Pomfret a coward. 



NUMBER III. 

PREJUDICES OP THE PEOPLE OP NEW YORK AGAINST GENERAL 
PUTNAM, 

ON this subject Dr. Sparks has the following note, appended to the 
letter in which Washington announces to General Putnam his 
removal from the command in the Highlands, and the causes of that 
removal. 

" General Putnam's advanced age, his good nature, and easy tem- 
perament, were among the chief causes of the ill success of his com- 
mand on the North River. His proceedings were not marked with 
the promptness, decision, and energy, nor even with the military 
address which had characterized his early years. If all these had 
been combined, it is probable there would still have been dissatisfac- 
tion, after the enemy had forced their way up the river, and laid 
waste its borders. Not only were complaints uttered by the popular 
voice, but the political leaders of the State expressed discontent. Ro- 
bert R. Livingston, then Chancellor of New York, wrote to General 
Washington on the subject in a pointed manner. 

" ' Your Excellency,' said he, ' is not ignorant of the extent of 
General Putnam's capacity and diligence ; and how well soever these 
may qualify him for this most important command, the prejudices to 
which his imprudent lenity to the disaffected, and too great inter- 
course with the enemy, have given rise, have greatly injured his 
influence. How far the loss of Fort Montgomery and the subsequent 
ravages of the enemy are to be attributed to him, I will not venture 
to say ; as this will necessarily be determined by a court of inquiry, 
whose determinations I would not anticipate. Unfortunately for him, 
the current of popular opinion in this and the neighboring States, and, 
as far as I can learn, in the troops under his command, runs strongly 
against him. For my own part, I respect his bravery and former 
services, and sincerely lament that his patriotism will not suffer him 
to take that repose, to which his advanced age and past services 
justly entitle him.' MS. Letter, Jan. \Uk. 

" It must be remembered, that at this station there were innumera- 



APPENDIX. 383 

We applications for passports to go into New York, under the pre- 
tence of urgent business, and various matters of a private concern ; 
and it was thought General Putnam's good nature was too pliant on 
these occasions, and that too many opportunities were afforded for 
an improper intercourse between the disaffected and the enemy. At 
any rate, the symptoms of uneasiness appeared from such high 
sources, and were so decidedly manifested, that General Washington 
deemed it necessary to take notice of them, and change the com- 
mand." 

The case cf General Schuyler, and many others, afford easy proof 
how readily such prejudices arise among the masses of the people, 
without any good foundation ; and how the best and ablest officers, 
and most devoted patriots, may be temporarily involved in the sha- 
dows of public censure, and even removed from the sphere of their 
useful efforts, without in the least diminishing their claims to the 
gratitude and respect of posterity. The history of General Washing- 
ton is not wanting in lessons of this kind ; and, if some distinguished 
and talented officers in his own army, and others who stood high in 
the confidence ol the American people, could have prevailed in their 
designs, even he would have been superseded in that lofty command, 
of which it is difficult to say, whether the station conferred dignity 
upon the man, or the man upon the station.
