LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF 
GEORGE MASON, OF VIRGINIA. 



CHAPTER I. 

IN PRIVATE LIFE. 
1780-1782. 

George Mason did not attend the fall session of the As 
sembly in 1780, as had been his design, and his temporary 
retirement from public life, which took place at this time, 
occurred, therefore, a little earlier than he had at first con 
templated. In the letters of Joseph Jones, who was then in 
the Assembly, letters which have been recently published, 
there are several allusions to Colonel Mason. Jones wrote 
to Madison in October that he had been applied to both by 
Colonel Mason and Colonel Meade relative to the consulship 
for Spain, which they desired should be given to Mr. Harri 
son, George Mason s merchant friend in Martinique. It is 
satisfactory to know that this gentleman did get the ap 
pointment, some years later, after the adoption of the new 
Constitution. Joseph Jones wrote to Madison the 2d of 
December : 

" Mr. Mason has not yet appeared, and I do not expect he 
will this session, as he has the remains upon him of a severe 
attack of the gout."

2 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE AT A SON. 

The project of the land cession had therefore to be 
carried through the Assembly without George Mason s 
personal assistance, and on the 2d of January, 1781, the act 
for this purpose was passed. But as two of its eight condi 
tions were not satisfactory to Congress, the matter was not 
fully settled until some time later. Colonel Clark was in 
Virginia during this winter, and no doubt he visited his 
friend at " Gunston Hall " before leaving the State. Arnold s 
raid took place at this time, and Colonel Clark assisted in 
the defence of the James River. In the spring the Assem 
bly, which met in March, was disturbed by the British and 
forced to adjourn from place to place. Colonel Mason, in 
his retirement at " Gunston," was keenly alive to the critical 
situation of the country, and though no longer in the coun 
cils of his State, he was revolving at home projects for the 
public good. And the fruit of some of his reflections appears 
in the following letter to the Virginia delegates in Congress: 

Letter to the Honorable the Virginia Delegates in Congress at Phila 
delphia, April 3, 1781. 

GENTLEMEN : 

Permit me to recommend to your consideration a subject which 
I think merits the attention of Congress. The enemy is now pro 
fessedly carrying on a predatory war against the United States 
contrary to the custom of civilized nations. A board of Refugees 
has been some time sitting in New York upon the subject of 
depredation and consulting upon the most effectual methods of 
plundering the defenceless part of the inhabitants of the Ameri 
can States in which they are avowedly authorized and supported 
by the British king and his generals. Several private people have 
lately been robbed, their houses burned and their estates ruined 
by the crews of British ships. Arnold is at this time preparing 
a great number of flat-bottomed boats at Portsmouth notoriously 
for the purpose of plundering the tobacco warehouses and the 
inhabitants upon the rivers and creeks in Virginia and Maryland. 
How practicable a plan of this sort is I need hardly mention to 
gentlemen acquainted with the situation of this country. What 
may be the fatal consequences not only of disabling many thou- 



LETTER TO THE VIRGINIA DELEGATES IX CONGRESS. 3 



sands from paying their taxes and contributing to the support of 
the common cause, but of throwing them also as a dead weight 
on the rest of the community, or how few of them may have 
public virtue enough to withstand the terrors of poverty and ruin 
are topics which, however disagreeable, deserve the most serious 
reflections that if possible the evil may be averted. Whether the 
king and his ministry encouraged by their success in Carolina ex 
pect by such means to make an easier conquest of the Southern 
States, or whether expecting the interference of the great powers 
of Europe to compel them to relinquish their claim to the Ameri 
can States, they are now acting upon the principles of revenge 
determined to desolate what they despair of recovering be this 
as it may it is surely the duty of the Great Council of America 
to endeavor if possible to prevent the mischief and save from 
ruin such numbers of their citizens. Whoever considers the im 
portance of the trade of these States to Great Britain, and her 
expectations of great part of it returning into British channels, 
upon a peace, may readily conceive that she will be alarmed at 
any measures which must affect it hereafter by imposing such 
burdens upon it as will give a lasting preference to other nations. 
If therefore Congress were to recommend to the Legislatures of 
the different States immediately to enact laws, declaring that all 
private property which has been or shall be plundered or de 
stroyed by the British troops or others acting under the authority 
of the King of Great Britain, beyond high-water mark, from a 
certain day shall be hereafter reimbursed and made good to the 
individual sufferers and their heirs by dutys to be imposed upon 
all imports from Great Britain into the respective States, after a 
peace and to be continued until full reparation shall be accord 
ingly made, and for this purpose directing valuations upon oath 
to be made of all private property so plundered or destroyed, to 
be returned with the names and places of abode of the owners to 
some certain public office in each State and there duly registered, 
it is more than probable it would produce good effects. The 
fund is adequate to the purpose and the measure without con 
quest could not be counteracted. There is hardly a merchant 
or manufacturer in Great Britain who would not feel himself 
affected by it ; if anything can restrain them this probably would. 
Their commanders here would immediately represent it to the 



4 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

ministry and inquire their further instructions and the nation 
would be cautious of repeating mischiefs which must one day 
reverberate upon themselves. If it had not this effect it at least 
would be a piece of justice to the injured to whom the commu 
nity owes justice, if it cannot afford them protection. The only 
objection that occurs to me is the common maxim "that all dutys 
ultimately fall upon the consumer," and consequently that this 
would be a tax upon ourselves. If this were true I think it no 
good objection, because it would only be reimbursing by a volun 
tary tax one part of the community what they had suffered from 
their local circumstances more than the other without any fault 
of their own. But the maxim is not true with respect to dutys 
upon the imports of any particular country, while we are not con 
fined to their market, but have an open trade with all the world, 
and therefore this charge would fall either upon the aggressing 
nation, or upon those who, disaffected to the American cause, 
were desirous of giving Great Britain an impolitic and undue 
preference. It would fall partly upon both. I got a bill passed 
a year or two ago in the Virginia House of Delegates but it was 
rejected in the Senate for no other reason that I could learn but 
that it was ruin for Virginia to make such a law unless similar 
measures were adopted by the other States. Should these hints 
be approved there is not a moment to be lost, and such a measure 
should not be intended merely in terrorem, but carried into the 
strictest execution. 

There is another subject which deserves the public attention. 
I have always endeavored to make myself well acquainted with 
the sentiments of the bulk of the people, conscious that in gov 
ernments like ours, upon this in a great measure must depend 
the success of the present contest. I live in a part of the country 
remarkable for its Whigism and attachment to the cause of liberty, 
and it is with much concern I find a general opinion prevailing 
that our allies are spinning out the war in order to weaken 
America as well as Great Britain and thereby leave us at the end 
of it as dependent as possible on themselves. However unjust 
this opinion may be, it is natural enough to planters and farmers 
burdened with heavy taxes and frequently dragged from their 
families by military duty in the continual alarms occasioned by 
the superiority of the British navy. They see their property 



A FRENCH FLEET REQUIRED. 5 



daily exposed to destruction ; they see with what facility the 
British troops are removed from one part of the continent to 
another, and with what infinite charge and fatigue ours are too 
late obliged to follow. If our allies had a superior fleet here I 
should have very little doubt of a favorable issue to the war, 
but without it I fear we are deceiving both them and ourselves 
in expecting we shall be able to keep our people much longer 
firm in so unequal an opposition to Great Britain. Would it not 
be wise and honest to lay this matter candidly before them, and 
with decent firmness explain how much our mutual interest 
requires a fleet upon the American coast superior to that of our 
common enemy. 

I have mentioned to you my thoughts upon these very interest 
ing subjects, trusting that the motives upon which I act (the 
good of our country) will induce you to pardon such a liberty in 
a private gentleman and render any further apology unnecessary. 
Ill health hindering my attendance at Richmond upon the last 
session of the Assembly prevents my knowing which of the 
Virginia delegates are now in Congress, otherwise I should only 
have wrote to one or two of the members, instead of addressing 
myself to the delegates in a letter which from the superscription 
may appear to have the air of an official one. 

I have the honor to be with the greatest respect, gentlemen, 
Your most obedient servant, 

G. MASON. 

April 20. P. S. Since the above letter was wrote, several of 
the enemy s ships have been within two or three miles of Alexan 
dria ; they have burned and plundered several houses and carried 
off a great many slaves ; though I have hitherto been fortunate 
enough to lose no part of my property. 1 

The members of the Ohio Company proposed at this time 
to make another effort with the Virginia Assembly to secure 
their lands. Robert Carter of " Nomini " wrote to a friend, 
on this subject, April I4th : 

" It is said that the House of Delegates rejected the Company s 
claim because their works of survey were returned by a surveyor 
1 Madison MSS., State Department. 



6 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

[Hancock Lee] not legally appointed. Nevertheless that session 
established some officers claims whose works of survey were 
returned by surveyors acting under no better authority than the 
surveyor appointed by the Ohio Company. It is expected that 
these cases will be relied on as precedents and the claims of the 
Ohio Company will be revived. This matter is of a joint concern, 
therefore the parties must join in presenting a petition which I 
apprehend should be done this approaching session, and I purpose 
to make some movement therein." 

He accordingly wrote to Colonel Mason on the nth of 
May, suggesting such action, and he adds. "If this idea 
should be approved on and a petition shall be prepared and 
presented, pray have my name inserted therein for two 
fortieth parts, I having purchased two shares of the late Mr. 
Augustine Washington and Mr. Gawin Corbin, members of 
the Ohio Company." ; 

The American troops, under Lafayette, Steuben, and 
Wayne, were in Virginia, in the spring of 1781, for the 
purpose of repelling the invasion of the enemy ; and an act 
of the Assembly, authorizing the seizure of cattle for the use 
of the army, to supply them with provisions, was put in 
operation, causing some dissatisfaction. George Mason 
thought that the commissioners were carrying out this law 
in a manner that would inflict needless injury on the people 
and alienate them from the cause of patriotism, and he 
wrote to Jefferson, then governor of the State, calling his 
attention to the matter. 

FAIRFAX COUNTY, GUNSTON HALL, 
May I4th, 1781. 

SIR, 

The order for seizing live cattle for the supply of the army 
is like to produce much confusion and oppression in this part of 
the country from the vague, and (as I apprehend) illegal instruc 
tions of Mr. Brown to his deputies, who are acting very differently 
in the different counties, according to each man s interpretation 
of instructions which no man understands. This, if not timely 

1 Carter Letter-Books. 



LETTER TO JEFFERSON. 



prevented by clear and precise orders from the executive, will in 
many instances occasion lawsuits, and in some, most probably, 
violence. The instructions I have seen from Mr. Brown direct 
his deputies to take a tenth part of every man s stock. The true 
construction of this I take to be a tenth part of every man s 
stock, in quantity and quality. But it would be a wanton waste of 
cattle. In some counties they estimate the value of a man s 
whole stock, and take the tenth part of that value, in beef cattle. 
In other counties (particularly in this) the deputy commissary 
thinks himself authorized to take in beef cattle the tenth part of 
the number of each man s stock, which would generally be near 
half of the value of the whole. And as, upon the common 
average of stocks, there is not a tenth part of them beef cattle, 
if the measure was to be executed throughout the State in this 
manner, every family would be left without beef, tallow, or leather 
for the ensuing year ; the quantity of cattle immediately taken 
would be enormous, not less, upon a moderate computation, I 
conceive than forty or fifty thousand beeves, and there would 
not be a beef left to supply the army another campaign. The only 
laws I know of upon which this power of seizure is founded are the 
two acts passed in the last May sessi on, one " for procuring a sup 
ply of provisions and other necessaries for the army," empowering 
the governor and council to appoint commissioners for seizing 
certain enumerated articles at fixed prices, and the other " an act 
for giving further powers to the Governor and Council," extending 
the powers given by the former act to the obtaining so many live 
cattle as may be wanted for supplying the militia or other troops, 
to be valued and appraised by two disinterested persons upon 
oath &c ; provided always that not more than one half of the bul 
locks and barren cows belonging to any person, fit for slaughter, 
shall be subject to such seizure. These two acts are continued 
by a subsequent session, with only an augmentation of the prices 
enumerated in the first act, occasioned by the depreciation of 
money in the meantime. But I think nothing is therein said 
about the price of live cattle, it being unnecessary as the price 
had not been ascertained by the former acts, and the cattle were 
to be appraised at the time of seizure. The wife Jit for slaughter 
can hardly be literally conformed to at this season of the year, 
and may reasonably be extended to such cattle as are fit to fatten 



8 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

for slaughter. But certainly the power is limited to the half of 
such cattle belonging to any such person, and any commissary 
presuming to exceed it will act contrary to law, and distress the 
people unnecessarily, as the one half of such cattle will afford 
more than an ample supply. There are also doubts with respect 
to draught oxen, which I am sure it was not the intention of the 
legislature to seize for beef, nor do they come within the descrip 
tion of the law. The people might as well have their waggon or 
plough horses taken from them as their draught oxen. 

Another subject of dispute is the price of cattle. By a vote of 
both houses in November last the executive is empowered to 
pursue such measures as to them appear practicable and effectual 
for the laying in such quantity of beef and salt as shall be neces 
sary for supplying the army, allowing for grass beef 24 / per 
pound and for salt ^70 per bushel. And although from the 
whole tenor and style of the said vote, it is evident that it relates 
only to the supply of the army during the then slaughter season, 
and not at all to the powers, prices or valuations described in the 
before mentioned acts, yet some of the deputy commissaries 
apply it to the present seizure of live cattle, and instead of 
appraisement, the weight is judged by two men upon oath, and 
certificates given at 24.7 per pound, for which they say they have 
late instructions. In some counties the judges fix this at what 
they think the nett weight of the cattle in their present poor con 
dition ; in other counties at what they think would be the nett 
weight if the cattle were fat and fit for slaughter, or what they 
would weigh in the slaughter season next fall, as in the mean time 
they would not cost their owners a penny. A grass bullock which 
would have weighed 400 last November, will not at this time 
weigh 200 pounds, so that in some counties the people will get 
less that half what their neighbors receive, or of the real value of 
their cattle, besides the loss by depreciation since last November. 
The commissary in this and some other counties is, by these dif 
ficulties, prevented from proceeding, whereupon I promised to 
lay the matter before your Excellency and the council, and to 
communicate to them the result. Sensible of the important 
objects in which the time of the executive is now taken up, I 
should not have troubled them with this, if I did not foresee that 
the purposes of the law will be in a great measure defeated, and 



RAIDS OF 7 HE ENEMY. 9 

great confusion ensue, unless prevented by speedy and precise 
instructions to the deputy-commissaries so as to put their busi 
ness upon a just and equal footing. 

The people in this part of Virginia are well disposed to do 
everything in their power to support the war, but the same prin 
ciples which attach them to the American cause will incline them 
to resist injustice or oppression. I would further beg leave to 
suggest that it might be better to take now only such a number 
of cattle as are wanted for immediate use, and suffer the others 
to remain longer on their own pastures, where at this season of 
the year they will thrive faster, upon grass alone, than fed with 
corn, collected in numbers in strange pastures, and a great ex 
pense be saved to the public. It will be necessary also to order 
that the cattle be collected in places out of the reach of the enemy, 
when the situation of the county will admit it. I am led to 
mention this last circumstance from my knowing that the place 
pitched upon in this county is so near the river that a party from 
a single vessel might carry off the cattle in two or three hours, 
although a considerable part of the county is out of the reach of 
the enemy, except in great force. 

I beg the favor of an answer by the first post, or other safe 
conveyance, and remain with the greatest respect, Sir, your most 
obedient humble servant, 

G. MASON. 

His Excellency, Thomas Jefferson, Esq. : 
Governor of Virginia. 1 

The raids of the enemy along all the navigable waters of 
Virginia were constant at this period, and the residents on 
the Potomac, among the rest of this exposed class of the 
population, were in a continual state of alarm. Col. Henry 
Lee, father of Henry Lee, the young lieutenant-colonel of 
cavalry, was the county lieutenant of Prince William, and in 
a letter to Governor Jefferson of the Qth of April, he tells of 
a small schooner which a few days before had gone up to 
Alexandria, the raiders stealing negroes and burning houses

B. J. Lossing. 



10 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

on their way, and he adds: " If the enemy had succeeded 
at Alexandria they intended, one of the prisoners says, to 
have burnt General Washington s houses, plundered Colonel 
Mason and myself, and endeavored to have made me a 
prisoner." 

On the 1 2th, Alexandria was in much confusion at the 
approach of the enemy s fleet. Six armed vessels went up 
the river, and the counties of Stafford, Prince William, and 
Fairfax were the " scene of war." * Colonel Fitzgerald, how 
ever, made such a bold show that the British did not land, 
and so " Gunston " was not molested. Under the appre 
hension of the enemy s approach, George Mason prepared 
to move into Maryland, farther from the river, and he sent 
his valuables, with the following letter, to his friend, Pearson 
Chapman, of Charles County. 

GUNSTON HALL, Thursday Afternoon, 
May sist, 1781. 

DEAR SIR : The rapid march of the enemy obliges me to send as 
many of my effects, as I can readily remove, to Maryland, and I 
expect to follow immediately with Mrs. Mason and my daughters. 
I must therefore beg the favour of you to permit all the things I 
send to be put into your dwelling house, for safety, until I can 
carry them up to my son William s house at the head of Matta- 
woman, which I shall do with all possible expedition. I expect 
Mrs. Mason and the girls will be over early to-morrow. 

Part of the Virginia Light Horse crossed at Fredericks[burg ?] on 
Tuesday night ; the Marquis Troops (who are not strong enough 
for an action) were expected there last night, unless prevented 
by the enemy. Lord Cornwallis with the main body of the Brit 
ish army was at Hanover Court House (scarce fifty miles from 
Fredericksburg) on Tuesday morning, their object, no doubt, 
to defeat the Marquis Troops before General Waine came up, or 
to prevent the junction : this intelligence comes from an officer 
sent express to General Waine and may be relied on. I think if 
the winds permit we may expect their fleet up this river in a very

.jw days. Our situation in Virginia is truly critical and danger 
ous ; a very few weeks, unless the enemy can be checked, will 
place Maryland in the same predicament. Nothing can speedily 
extricate the two States but the arrival of a strong French fleet 
which there is reason to expect every day. I have given you the 
earliest information in my power, that you may endeavour to 
secure your moveables by carrying them a few miles from the 
river, where I think they will be safe for some time. 

I beg the favour of you to let your people and cart assist my 
people in carrying up the things from the landing to the house, 
that the boat may return as quick as possible ; and am dear sir 
Your most obedient servant 

GEORGE MASON. 

If Mr. Chapman is from home, Mrs. Chapman will be pleased 
to open this letter. 

Mr. Pearson Chapman 

Charles County 

Maryland 

The Chapmans lived almost immediately opposite " Guns- 
ton " on the Maryland side of the Potomac, and the old 
Eilbeck place, " Mattawoman," was three miles farther off 
at the head of Mattawoman Creek. The mother of Pearson 
Chapman, Mrs. Constance Chapman, was an intimate friend 
of George Mason s first wife, and drawing up her will, in 
1768, she makes therein the following bequest : " I give and 
bequeath unto my friend Mrs. Ann Mason a mourning ring, 
the stone to be set round with diamond sparks, the said ring 
to be the value of three guineas and a half, and be inscribed 
with my age and the time of my death." Mrs. Chapman, 
however, survived Mrs. Mason many years, dying in Fairfax 
County, in 1798. A great-grandson of Pearson Chapman is 
living now at the old place in Maryland, which is called 
"Vuedel Eau." 

Colonel Mason wrote two letters early in June to his son 
George in France.

12 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

VIRGINIA, GUNSTON HALL, 
DEAR GEORGE: June 3 d, 1781. 

A gentleman now here, on his way to the Northern States, and 
from thence to the West Indies, affords me a better opportunity 
of writing to you than I have had for a long time past ; and as 
I shall write duplicates, and direct them to be sent by different 
vessels, some of them will probably reach you : they will be en 
closed in covers to Messrs. Schweighauser and Dobree, Mer 
chants in Nantes. I find from some of your letters, that most, 
if not all of our letters to you have miscarried, and consequently 
that you are unacquainted with everything which has happened 
here in your absence. Your grandmother, Mrs. Eilbeck died last 
December and has willed her estate, in the manner she always 
intended ; some legacies in slaves and money to her granddaugh 
ters, a negro boy to John and Tom, and the bulk of her fortune 
to your brother William. Your estate here is at present in good 
order, and a promising harvest coming on, if we are able to reap 
it. There was a pretty good crop of corn made on it last year, 
and about 10,000 Ibs. of pork sold at a high nominal price (^200 
per hundred) but before the money could be invested in tobacco 
the rapid depreciation reduced it exceedingly. Part has been 
invested in tobacco, some in the usual way of Inspector s notes ; 
the remainder I have advised your brother Thomson to endeavor 
to invest in tobacco in the hands of substantial people, upon 
tobacco bonds, rather than having it in the public warehouses, 
where it is not safe a week from the enemy, who have within 
these two months burned more than ten thousand hogsheads of 
tobacco in Virginia, and still continue to destroy all they can get 
at. I observe what you say of our tobacco at Bordeaux being 
unsold in March. I hope it still remains so, as the quantity 
destroyed here must raise the price in Europe, beyond anything 
known within the memory of man. I will write to Messrs Delaps 
upon the subject. This family has not yet lost any tobacco, 
slaves or other property, by the enemy, although their ships have 
been as high as Alexandria, but we are in daily expectation of 
sharing the same fate with our neighbors upon this and the other 
rivers, where many families have been suddenly reduced from 
opulence to indigence, particularly upon James river, the enemy 
taking all the slaves, horses, cattle, furniture and other property 



LETTERS TO HIS ELDEST SON IN FRANCE. 13 

they can lay their hands on ; and what they can t carry away they 
wantonly destroy. We have removed our furniture, backwards 
and forwards two or three times, upon different alarms, by which 
it is very much damaged : great part of it was packed up last 
week and sent to Maryland, where your brother Thomson and 
your sisters now are. 

The schooner Isabella was drove on shore, on the coast of 
North Carolina, and the vessel lost ; some part of the cargo was 
saved, but upon the average settlement of the proceeds, our pro 
portion in the present depreciated money was hardly worth the 
trouble of receiving. Mine was about p^3,ooo and yours ^366, 
including Mrs. Eilbeck s, Dr. Brown s and the whole consign 
ment to your brother Thomson. The letters, bills of lading, and 
invoyces all came safe to hand, but yours were so irregular, some 
packages mentioned in the invoyce not being inserted in the bills 
of lading, and some of the contents not particularized nor ex 
tended in the invoyce, so that if the goods had arrived safe we 
should hardly have been able to ascertain them properly, much 
less was it practicable to fix the real value upon the general 
average. You have probably been a loser by this, though very 
deservedly ; if ever you send any more goods, pray be more 
methodical and exact. The ship General Washington is fitted out 
as a privateer, and I believe is now upon a cruise. She arrived 
from Amsterdam in a New England port, where her cargo pro 
duced less than half the value here. I had better than ^"200 
sterling cost of goods in her upon my own private account, which 
still remain in New England, from whence I am not likely to get 
them soon, if ever : by these disappointments the family are in 
great want of necessaries. Our bay and rivers are entirely in the 
possession of the enemy, our little trade totally at an end, and 
almost all the Virginia vessels taken. 

The family, I thank God, are all well, except myself, who am 
but just recovering from a fit of the gout. No remarkable 
changes have happened among your acquaintance. Pray let me 
know if my order on Penet Da Costa and Company was duly 
paid. Let me know also where Mr. William Lee is, and in what

French language ; it is owing to your conversing too much among 
your own countrymen, and to your not accustoming yourself to 
write French. I hope, however, you will not be discouraged, but 
will still endeavor to make yourself master of it. 

I have not yet received the surveys of my back lands ; when I 
do (if it is in time) I will transmit you copies of them, and par 
ticularize the terms by which I purpose to settle them. I can now 
only mention the outlines. I will on no consideration risk the im 
porting, or maintaining people, at my charge. But if settlers can 
be engaged to come in, at their own charge, I will grant them long 
leases, at very low rents ; vizt., for three lives, or twenty-one years, 
paying the first three years, only the taxes of the quantity of land 
leased and afterwards the annual rent of about thirty shillings ster 
ling per hundred acres, and the taxes ; with covenants to plant 
orchards and make the usual improvements of buildings (which 
you know in this country are not great) within four or five years 
after the end of the present war ; the lessee to have sub-tenants, 
if he pleases, preserving one third part of the quantity leased 
uncut and uncultivated, to supply the premises with wood and 
timber. Considering the conveniencies of game, fish, wild-fowl, 
and the navigation (my lands being below the Falls of the Ohio) 
and the extreme richness and fertility of the soil, the fineness of 
the climate, and the levelness of the land, these terms are very 
reasonable, and I should think would induce men of substance to 
take quantities and bring in settlers. I presume this will find 
you in Paris, or, as I rather hope, in the south of France. I can 
not but think you judged extremely ill, in spending so much time 
in Nantes, where you could expect no great improvement, either 
in health, knowledge or manners. I think it will also be very 
imprudent in you to return to America, without trying the effect 
of one summer, either in the south of France, Italy or Spain, as 
the best physicians in Paris may advise you : the recovery of 
health should be considered as your primary object, for without 
that you will have incurred much expence and loss of time to 
little purpose. 

I would recommend it to you to embark for America about 
next May, so as to have a warm weather voyage, and be some 
time again in your native climate, before the return of winter, and 
to endeavor to get your passage in a ship of war. If any are 
coming to America about the time, and you make proper use of

your letters and credentials, I should think you might by means 
of Doctor Franklin, Colonel Lawrence, or some men of interest, 
procure an order from the court for a passage in one of them. 

Mrs. Mason desires to be kindly remembered to you and joins 
in wishing you a restoration to health, and a safe return to your 
country and friends, with 

Dear George, 

Your affectionate father, 

G. MASON. 

P. S. Under the same cover you will have a letter upon pub 
lic affairs. 1 

VIRGINIA, GUNSTON HALL, June 3d, 1781. 

DEAR GEORGE : Your brother William writes you by this 
opportunity. He returned some time ago from South Carolina, 
where he commanded a company of volunteers (75 fine young 
fellows from this county). He had a rough campaign of it, and 
has acquired the reputation of a vigilant and good officer ; and 
I think is greatly improved by the expedition. Your brother 
Thomson has lately returned from a tour of militia-duty upon 
James River. He commanded a platoon, in a pretty close action 
at Williamsburg, and behaved with proper coolness and intrep 
idity. He is now from home or would have wrote you. 

I have written you very fully lately upon domestic subjects ; 
but I am not able to give you any agreeable public news. 
Our affairs have been, for some time, growing from bad to 
worse. The enemy s fleet commands our rivers, and puts it in 
their power to remove their troops, from place to place, when and 
where they please without opposition ; so that we no sooner 
collect a force sufficient to counteract them in one part of the 
country, but they shift to another, ravaging, plundering, and de 
stroying everything before them. Our militia turn out with great 
spirit, and have in several late actions, behaved bravely ; but they 
are badly armed and appointed. General Green, with about 
r,2co regular troops and some militia, is in South Carolina ; where 
he has taken all the enemy s posts, except Charlestown. The 
enemy s capital object, at this time, seems to be Virginia. 
General Philips died lately in Petersburg ; upon which the com 
mand of the British troops there devolved upon Arnold ; but Ld.

1 6 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

Cornwallis, quitting North Carolina, has since joined Arnold, 
with about 1,200 infantry and 300 cavalry, and taken the chief 
command of their army in Virginia, now consisting of about 5,000 
men : They have crossed James River, and by the latest accounts 
were at Westover ; their light horse having advanced as far as 
Hanover Court House ; They have burned Page s warehouses, 
where the greatest part of the York River tobacco was collected ; 
they had before burned most of the tobacco upon James River, 
and have plundered great part of the adjacent county. The 
Marquis De La Fayette is about twenty miles below Fredericks- 
burg with about 1,200 regulars and 3,000 militia, waiting the 
arrival of General Waine, with about 1,500 regular troops of 
the Pennsylvania line. 

We have had various accounts of the sailing of a French fleet, 
with a body of land forces, for America ; should they really 
arrive it would quickly change the face of our affairs, and infuse 
fresh spirits and confidence ; but it has been so long expected in 
vain, that little credit is now given to reports concerning it. 

You know from your own acquaintance in this part of Virginia 
that the bulk of the people here are staunch Whigs, strongly 
attached to the American cause and well affected to the French 
alliance ; yet they grow uneasy and restless, and begin to think 
that our allies are spinning out the war, in order to weaken 
America as well as Great Britain, and thereby leave us at the end 
of it, as dependent as possible upon themselves. 

However unjust this opinion may be, it is natural enough for 
planters and farmers, burdened with heavy taxes, and frequently 
dragged from their familys upon military duty, on the continual 
alarms occasioned by the superiority of the British fleet. They 
see their property daily exposed to destruction, they see with 
what facility the British troops are removed from one part of the 
continent to another, and with what infinite charge and fatigue 
ours are, too late, obliged to follow ; and they see too very plainly, 
that a strong French fleet would have prevented all this. If our 
allies had a superior fleet here, I should have no doubt of a 
favorable issue to the war, but without it, I fear we are deceiving 
both them and ourselves, in expecting we shall be able to keep 
our people much longer firm, in so unequal an opposition to Great 
Britain. France surely intends the separation of these States for-

ever from Great Britain. It is highly her interest to accomplish 
this ; but by drawing out the thread too fine and long, it may 
unexpectedly break in her hands. 

God bless you, my dear child ! and grant that we may again 
meet, in your native country, as freemen, otherwise, that we never 
see each other more, is the prayer of 

Your affectionate father, 

G. MASON. 1 

It seems not unlikely that this latter interesting and 
patriotic letter may have had some influence with the 
French Court, and hastened the arrival of the French fleet. 
The Honorable James M. Mason, who possessed a copy of it 
which he transcribed for the "Virginia Historical Register," 
wrote to the editor that " the indorsement on [the copy] 
shows that the original had been by Dr. Franklin put into 
the hands of the Count de Vergennes doubtless from the 
tenor of the letter, intended by Dr. F. to stimulate the 
government of France to send to the revolted colonies the 
promised succour. The concluding paragraph," adds Mr. 
Mason, " you will agree with me, I think, would have 
adorned the ages of Brutus and Manlius." 

In Gen. John Mason s recollections of his childhood he 
mentions that the last tutor that his father had at " Gunston " 
was a Mr. Constable, who was a native of Scotland, and was 
engaged in that country to come over to Virginia as a 
teacher in Colonel Mason s family. In 1781 Mr. Constable 
wished to leave Virginia to make his home in the West 
Indies, and Colonel Mason wrote to Thomas Nelson, then 
governor of the State, to obtain a passport for him. 

FAIRFAX COUNTY, GUNSTON HALL, 
SIR ; September 3d, 1781. 

A young gentleman (Mr. David Constable) a native of Scotland, 
from the college of Aberdeen, has lived in my family ever since 
the year 1774, as a tutor to my children, during which time he has 
supported a very good character, and his behaviour has been un-

exceptionable, in every instance, but refusing the oath of alle 
giance to the commonwealth, which he told me at the time he was 
induced to do from some expectations he had from his friends 
in the British West Indies, where he intended to settle, after the 
expiration of his engagements in my family. He has an elder 
brother who has lived many years in the island of St. Christo 
pher s, where he has had the management of some estates belong 
ing to gentlemen residing in Great Britain, and has acquired 
considerable property. From this brother Mr. Constable has 
very lately received a letter, informing him that he should return 
to Britain the beginning of next winter, to repair a constitution 
injured by long residence in a warm climate, pressing him to 
come to St. Christopher s immediately, and promising if he 
arrived while he remained there, to give him an estate he has 
in the island and put all his agencies into his hands. This is so 
much beyond anything Mr. Constable can expect in Virginia or 
may ever meet with hereafter, that out of friendship to a man who 
has lived so many years in my family, and behaved so well in it, 
I wish him enabled to avail himself of it, and for that purpose 
must entreat your Excellency to grant him a passport or permit, 
to go with a flag to Lord Cornwallis s army, from whence he may 
readily obtain a passage to the West Indies. And his speedy 
arrival there being of the utmost importance to him, you will 
oblige me exceedingly in transmitting me such a passport by the 
next post. This favor I flatter myself will be granted as an act of 
the last session of Assembly invests the governor and council with 
such a power ; as Mr. Constable s detention here would mate 
rially injure him as an individual, without the smallest bene 
fit to the American cause, and as it is not in his power to give any 
useful intelligence to the enemy, or if it was, I know him to be a 
man of more honor than to abuse any indulgence you shall be 
pleased to grant him, and can venture to engage for his conduct. 
I am, with the greatest esteem and respect 

Sir, your most obedient, humble servant 

G. MASON. 

P. S. If Mr. Constable is permitted to go by water it will 
enable him to carry his books and other effects which he 
could not well carry by land. 1

A DINNER-PARTY AT "MOUNT VERNON" 19 



Lafayette passed through Colchester, the little post town 
near " Gunston," in the spring of 1781, and the tax commis 
sioners, one of whom was Martin Cockburn, George Mason s 
friend, and another Richard Chichester, whose daughter 
married one of Colonel Mason s sons, gave out to the Mar 
quis a quantity of wheat for his command. 1 It is very 
likely that Lafayette visited " Gunston " at this time and 
brought messages from Washington to its proprietor. The 
army of Washington was on its \vay in September to the 
memorable field of Yorktown, and great preparations were 
made for its approach in the counties it would have to 
traverse from Georgetown to Dumfries. The militia were 
instructed by the county lieutenants, through letters from 
the commander-in-chief, to repair the roads and make 
them passable for wagons. The baggage wagons of the 
American and French forces, the cavalry, and the beef 
cattle were all to take this route. Washington wrote to 
request the gentlemen of the neighborhood, as a pleasing 
mark of attention, to assist the French officers, Rocham- 
beau, Chastellux, and others, with their carriages, from 
point to point. From " Mt. Vernon " they were to be 
furnished with carriages to Dumfries, where new relays 
were requested to take them to Fredericksburg. Colonel 
Mason must have met these distinguished strangers at 
this time, and in all probability his equipage was at their 
command. Washington arrived at " Mt. Vernon " on the 
9th of September, Rochambeau, Chastellux, and their 
suites the following day. A dinner-party was given at 
" Mt. Vernon" on the nth, and the next morning the 
journey to Williamsburg was resumed, lasting two days 
longer. This was the first time Washington had been 
home since 1775. 

Thomson Mason, who was living at his country-seat in 
Loudon County, wrote to Washington offering the services 
of his two sons in the proposed campaign.

20 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



RASPBERRY PLAIN, Sept. 26th, 1781. 
MY DEAR GENERAL : 

I must sincerely congratulate your Excellency upon your safe 
return to your native country, and look upon it as a happy pres 
age of putting a glorious period to the present war. 

But do not flatter yourself that your fatigues are to end with 
this war. No, more glorious ones are yet reserved for you, in rid 
ding your country of its domestic enemies, more silent indeed, 
but not less destructive, than its foreign invaders ; and in fixing 
some permanent constitution that may render us happier than the 
present ever can ; it is my most ardent wish and expectation, that 
you will accomplish all this. 

Nothing but my crazy constitution should have restrained me 
from thanking your Excellency in person for the benefits which 
I as a private citizen, am likely to enjoy from your labors ; but 
as my health will not permit me to undertake so long a journey, 
this will be handed to you by one of my two eldest sons. The 
first Stevens Thomson is equipped as a volunteer horseman, the 
second having served out his tour of duty as an ensign in the 
Loudon militia, is also desirous of serving the remainder of the 
campaign as a volunteer, to which I have consented and sent 
him a horse. From the retired privacy in which they have been 
brought up, I have no expectation that they can render their 
country any effectual service. But to pay a grateful respect to 
General Washington is a duty due from every citizen of America, 
and for that reason only, do they wait upon your Excellency. 
In whatever capacity you may employ them for the remainder of 
the campaign, (and I can part with them no longer,) I will be an 
swerable they will discharge their duty with bravery, secrecy and 
integrity ; and the oldest is tolerably ready at most kinds of 
business. 

I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect and esteem, 
your Excellency s most devoted, obliged and affectionate, humble 

servant, 

THOMSON MASON. 

The surrender of Cornwallis took place on the iQth of 
October, and a few days later Colonel Mason had occasion

to write to Robert Carter of " Nomini," when he refers to 
the recent victory. 

GUNSTON HALL, October 27th, 1781. 
DEAR SIR : 

The bearer, Capt. Cleon Moore, a neighbor and particular 
friend of mine waits on you to rent some of your lands in Prince 
William County. As I thought it probable that the abuses too 
frequent among tenants might make you cautious of renting lands 
to a stranger, I take the liberty of introducing Capt. Moore to 
you, as a gentleman whose integrity and punctuality in whatever 
contract he makes with you, I think may be relied on, and one to 
whom I would most readily rent lands myself, if I had any which 
suited him. 

I congratulate you on the late signal success of our arms, which 
there is reason to hope will lay the foundation of a safe and last 
ing peace. 

I beg my compliments to your lady and family, and am, 
Dear Sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

G. MASON. 
Hon. Robert Carter, 

Nominy, Westmoreland.- 

In Congress at this time the land companies were pushing 
their claims to the Western territory, and they were sup 
ported in their pretensions by those States whose selfish 
and short-sighted policy was opposed to the acknowledgment 
of Virginia s charter rights rights in which a principle was 
involved most important to the autonomy of all the States. 
Madison wrote indignantly from Philadelphia to Jefferson in 
January, 1782, on this subject. The memorial of the In 
diana Company had been justified by Congress, in spite of 
the emphatic protest of the Viginia delegates, though so 
clearly an infringement upon Virginia s sovereignty. Madi 
son wished to receive from Virginia " an accurate and full 
collection of the documents which relate to the subject." 

1 MS. Letter. 



22 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

He sent the proceedings of Congress to his State while the 
Assembly was in session, but to his mortification they were 
not received in time. He had hoped that Jefferson would 
have undertaken the task of preparing and forwarding these 
papers ; and as it was, he found himself left without ade 
quate material to contradict the calumnies and misrepresen 
tations that were rife. He had evidently written to George 
Mason to aid him, for he adds : " Colonel Mason s industry 
and kindness have supplied us with some valuable papers 
and remarks." There had also been sent Joseph Jones 
" some judicious remarks " by Edmund Pendleton. 1 

Jefferson at this time was at " Monticello " by the bedside 
of his sick wife, and no assistance could be expected from 
him. At the spring session of the Assembly in 1782, a com 
mittee had been appointed " to state the title of Virginia to 
western territory," and this committee consisted of Jefferson, 
George Mason, Edmund Randolph, Arthur Lee, and Dr. 
Thomas Walker. Though Colonel Mason was not in the 
Assembly, his name was the first one proposed, as Randolph 
tells us. He was known to be an authority on this subject, 
and in the task assigned the committee it was anticipated 
that he would take the lead. Edmund Randolph writes to 
Arthur Lee : " I expected the first movement from him 
[George Mason], as being the first in nomination. Mr. Jef 
ferson s domestic happiness is threatened with too great an 
interruption by the illness of his wife, to suffer him to enter 
into the researches which our subject requires. Should I 
be so unfortunate as not to hear from Col. Mason on this 
weighty business, notwithstanding your request to him to 
communicate with me, I shall certainly write to him, urge 
him to assist his country, and through me correspond with 
Mr. Jefferson and Dr. Walker." 2 

In response to this call upon him, George Mason wrote 
the following statement of Virginia s title, in a letter to 
Edmund Randolph.

LETTER TO EDMUND RANDOLPH. 23 

GUNSTON HALL, October 19, 1782. 
DEAR SIR : 

Your favor of the 3oth of August was so long on the road that 
it did not reach me until a few days ago. I must beg pardon for 
not writing sooner to you and the other gentlemen of the Com 
mittee for stating the title of Virginia to her western territory. 
The truth is I was somewhat embarrassed by an appointment, 
which I was far from desiring or expecting ; and which I had not 
an opportunity of refusing, as I should have done, had I received 
notice of it before the last session ended. I quitted my seat in 
the House of Delegates, from a conviction that I was no longer 
able to do any essential service. Some of the public measures 
have been so contrary to my notions of policy and of justice 
that I wished to be no further concerned with, or answerable 
for them ; and to spend the remnant of my life in quiet and 
retirement. Yet with all her faults, my country will ever have 
my warmest wishes and affections ; and I would at any time, 
most cheerfully sacrifice my own ease and domestic enjoyments 
to the public good. But though I look upon asserting the right 
to our western territory, and thereby putting a stop to the 
dangerous usurpations of Congress, before they shall have been 
established into precedents, to be a matter of the utmost import 
ance, I do not know that it is in my power to give the committee 
any assistance. My distance from the seat of government, and 
the public archives, disables me from investigating the subject. 
What evidence had occurred to me I sent you last year by our 
friend Mr. May ; and I have since put into the hands of Dr. 
Lee an official copy of all the council-entries for lands upon the 
western waters. These necessarily imply an equal extension of 
our laws and jurisdiction ; and upon the exercise of jurisdiction, 
under the former as well as the present government, our title, in 
my opinion, in a great measure depends. Among the council- 
entries there is one for fifty thousand acres of land, near forty 
years ago, upon the Mississippi, beginning at the confluence of 
the Ohio and Mississippi, and running up both rivers to include 
the quantity. And the royal instructions to Sir William Gooch, 
respecting the Ohio Company in 1749, is to grant lands on either 
side the Ohio river, "within our colony of Virginia." Governor 
Dinwiddie, by proclamation in 1754, offered a bounty of two 



24 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

hundred thousand acres of land, upon the Ohio River, to the 
officers and soldiers of the First Virginia Regiment, commanded 
by Colonel Washington (now his Excellency, General Washing 
ton), which was afterwards surveyed accordingly, and patents 
granted, in the time of Lord Botetourt and Lord Dunmore. 
There were, besides, a great many patents and surveys upon 
record, and in the secretary s office, under the former govern 
ment, some of them of pretty old standing ; and a great number 
of inhabitants settled in that part of Augusta County which lay 
beyond the Alleghany mountains (upon the different branches of 
the western waters), under the particular encouragement of the 
Virginia laws, which, having received the royal assent, were con 
stitutional acts of the British government. Dr. Walker is better 
acquainted with the extent and dates of these settlements, sur 
veys, and grants than most men in America, and knows that the 
principal water-courses, &c., received their names from Virginia 
settlers. Col. Thomas Lewis is also very capable of giving 
information upon this subject. If I mistake not, two or three 
counties (Botetourt and Fincastle, besides the district of West- 
Augusta) were separated from that part of Augusta County which 
lay beyond the Alleghany mountains ; civil and military jurisdic 
tion regularly exercised, and representation in the Virginia 
legislature enjoyed there, before the present Revolution. And 
that more counties were not erected there was owing to a royal 
instruction of a very alarming and tyrannical nature, restraining 
the governor from assenting to any law for erecting new counties, 
unless a clause was inserted to deprive such new counties of the 
right of representation in the legislature ; which being evidently 
calculated to maintain an undue influence of the crown in our 
General Assembly, no such clause was submitted to. The gov 
ernor had recourse to the power of the prerogative, and instead 
of a new county, established the district of West-Augusta (to 
the north-westward) over the Alleghany mountains ; in which he 
commissioned civil magistrates and militia officers, and courts 
were regularly held there, suits brought, judgments granted, deeds 
recorded, &c. In the year 1775, the district of West- Augusta 
sent two representatives, John Harney and George Roots, Esqrs., 
to the general convention at Richmond, where they were re 
ceived ; and the inhabitants of the said district continued to send 



THE TREATY OF LANCASTER. 2$ 

their representatives to the Virginia legislature, until the same 
was formed into three distinct counties, Ohio, Monongalia, and 
Youghyoughgaine ; which counties have regularly ever since 
sent representatives to the House of Delegates and the Senate. 
Soon after the present Revolution, the county of Kentucky was 
separated from Botetourt and Fincastle, upon the Ohio, to the 
south-westward ; which has since been divided into three coun 
ties, Fayette, Lincoln, and Jefferson. Towns have been laid 
off, courts established, and civil and military jurisdiction regularly 
exercised in these counties, and each of them represented in the 
Virginia legislature ; several thousand inhabitants are settled in 
them, all deriving their titles from Virginia, subject to her laws, 
and to all intents and purposes her citizens. The British posts, 
within our chartered territory, at Kaskaskie upon the Mississippi, 
and St. Vincents upon the Obache, have been reduced by Virginia 
militia, without any assistance from or charge to the United 
States, and a garrison, as well as the civil establishment, under 
the sole direction and at the sole expense of the Virginia govern 
ment, has been maintained there. 

The purchase at the Treaty of Lancaster in 1743 was made 
with Virginia money ; and if I remember right, there is a clause 
showing that it was made for the use and benefit of the colony 
of Virginia, as far westward as his majesty should at any time 
choose to extend the settlements. It is evident, from the royal 
instructions in 1749 to Sir William Gooch, Lieutenant-Governor 
of Virginia, that the crown directed the settlements to be 
extended over the Ohio river ; and several subsequent laws 
were made for their encouragement. The purchase of Lancaster 
was made in the reign of George the second, when just regard 
was paid to the constitutional rights of the American colonies. 
It was made by Virginia commissioners appointed for that 
purpose ; and from the proceedings upon record, it appears that 
the whole transaction was fair, open, and in the presence of the 
commissioners and governors of the other colonies, particularly 
the province of New York, which a select committee of Congress 
have lately discovered had always the right to these lands. 
The purchase at Fort Stanwix (which in fact was only 
purchasing the same lands over again, for ministerial pur 
poses, which had been before purchased and paid for) was 



26 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

made in the reign of George the third, in the year 1768, 
when the rights of the colonies had been repeatedly violated, and 
under the direction of that ministry which formed the system 
for enslaving America, one of the first steps to which was dis 
membering the old colonies, and erecting new ones more immedi 
ately dependant upon the crown and the commands of the 
ministry. The whole transaction wore the face of mystery and 
knavery ; for though Dr. Walker was there as a public commis 
sioner for Virginia, he was refused access to the conferences, the 
greatest caution was used to conceal from him what they were 
about, and every thing until the business was finished, was con 
ducted privately with the Indian chiefs, by Sir William Johnston 
and the traders. The substance of these facts was proved by the 
oath of Dr. Walker, on his examination in the House of Dele 
gates, upon the hearing of the Indiana Company s title. It was 
also proved by the depositions on the same trial, that the tribu 
taries of the Six Nations had been totally expelled from this side 
the Ohio to the other (from whence they never returned) and the 
country conquered in the course of the last war ; and that before 
the treaty at Fort Stanwix, there were several Virginia settlers 
upon the very lands purchased by Trent and Sir William John 
ston for the Indiana Company. But if these damning circum 
stances were not in the case, the purchase made by the crown 
at the treaty of Fort Stanwix ought not to operate to the injury, 
but inure to the benefit of the colony to whom the country had 
been originally granted, as all the former purchases from the 
Indians had done. If such purchases could operate against the 
title of Virginia, they would have operated against the title to the 
Northern Neck, the greater part of which was possessed by the 
Indians when the grant was made by Charles II., and not pur 
chased from them for many years after. So late as Queen 
Anne s reign (when Governor Spotswood presided here) the 
Blue Ridge of mountains was by a solemn treaty fixed as the 
boundary between the English subjects and the Indians, yet in 
the reign of George the second the king and council gave Lord 
Fairfax a judgment for the lands to the fountain head of Potomac 
river, fourscore miles beyond the Blue Ridge. As our settle 
ments were extended, the wild game destroyed, and the country 
rendered unfit for the savage life, the Indians have been forced 



VIRGINIA S TITLE TC WESTERN LANDS. 2J 

to remove further, for the convenience of hunting. As they 
retired, purchase after purchase hath been made from them, and 
temporary lines and boundaries, for the sake of peace, from time 
to time accordingly settled between them and the English 
inhabitants here, but none of them have ever been considered 
as at all affecting the title of Virginia. When the colony of 
Virginia was first settled, it was without any previous purchase 
from the Indians. The first lands purchased from the Indians 
were only upon and near the mouths and larger parts of the 
rivers, then to the falls of the said rivers, then to the Blue Ridge of 
mountains, and afterwards (before the unnecessary purchase at 
Fort Stanwix) as far westward as the claim of Great Britain 
extended. Most of these purchases were made subsequent to 
the actual settlement and occupation of part of the lands pur 
chased. It is about sixty years ago since the people of Virginia 
settled the country over the Blue Ridge, and near forty years 
since they began to settle beyond the Appalatian or Alleghany 
mountains ; but the purchase at Lancaster was not made until 
1743, nor the purchase at Fort Stanwix till 1768. It has been 
objected to the treaty at Lancaster, and urged as a proof that 
the Indians were imposed on, that they sold their whole country, 
or in the common phrase, that they sold themselves out of house 
and home ; but this is a false suggestion. The country back of 
New York adjacent to Lake Ontario, was originally and still is 
the country and habitation of the Iroqtiois or Six Nations ; and 
this it will be found (I believe upon due examination) was the 
country which they put under the protection of the New York 
government, and perhaps also their beaver-hunting country, 
between that and the great lakes. The country upon the Ohio, 
above the Tennessee river, was what they called their con 
quered lands, from which they had totally extirpated the original 
inhabitants, and afterwards permitted the Delawares from the 
river Delaware, and the Shawnese from Potomac, with some 
other small tribes, to live there as their tributaries : These lands 
being of little use to them, and their right precarious, it may be 
presumed they were desirous to sell. If according to the opin 
ion of the best writers, the occupation of a few hordes of savages 
cannot give right to an extensive territory, as being contrary to 
the primary laws of nature, a conquest which utterly extirpates 



28 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

the inhabitants, and leaves the country desolate, being more con 
trary to the laws of nature, can confer no right on the conqueror. 
If the country is considered in the light of derelict lands, which 
the first possessor without any other claim, has a right to occupy 
and enjoy, a fortiori had the colony of Virginia, having a pre 
vious title, a right to possess and occupy them, as it has done. 

The English and American maps have uniformly laid down 
Virginia across the continent, to the westward, until the Treaty 
of Paris in 1762, and since to the river Mississippi, that having 
been then established the boundary between the British and 
French dominions. Many solemn acts of the British govern 
ment, at different periods, have recognized the right of Virginia 
to her western territory, nor can there be found any one act of 
government impeaching or invalidating it, until the conclusion of 
the last war, and after the adoption of that system, which by 
compelling America to assert her rights with the sword, has pro 
duced the present Revolution. Long before the Articles of Con 
federation (and I think previous to the American Declaration of 
Independence) the Virginia legislature, in that act which formed 
our constitution, had plainly described and declared the extent 
of our western territory. This was notorious to Congress, when 
the Articles of Confederation were formed, the sovereignty of 
each State respectively secured to it, the mutual guarranty stipu 
lated, and the proviso inserted " that no State shall be deprived 
of territory for the benefit of the United States." It was upon 
these express conditions that Virginia acceded to the Articles of 
Confederation ; the present attempt, therefore, to dismember 
Virginia, without her consent, is a flagrant breach of public 
faith, and if carried into execution dissolves the federal com 
pact, and renders it no longer obligatory upon this common 
wealth. Congress are properly the delegates of the different 
States, with certain powers defined and limited by the Articles 
of the Confederation ; these they can not be permitted to exceed, 
without establishing an arbitrary and tyrannical aristocracy ; for 
if under pretence of public utility, necessity, or under any pre 
tence whatsoever, they can, in one instance, exceed the powers 
delegated to them, they may in another, or in a hundred ; every 
usurpation will be urged as a precedent for others, and main 
tained by the command which they have (and must have) of our 



CLAIM OF CONGRESS TO SOVEREIGNTY. 29 

fleets and armies. They may in time proceed to fill up their own 
vacancies, vote themselves members for life, and what not ! 
Vhe only natural and safe remedy is, for every State to have a 
watchful eye over this great American council, to keep them con 
stantly within the lines of the Confederation, and to resist and 
reprobate their first attempts to exceed them. This was intended, 
about two years ago, by the General Assembly of Virginia, in 
their Remonstrance, but an ill-judged timidity (miscalled deli 
cacy) in our delegates at that time (I believe) prevented its being 
entered on the journals of Congress. If experience shall prove 
that the present powers of Congress are, in some instances, insuf 
ficient, let them be increased by additional Articles to the Con 
federation, acceded to, after due deliberation, b)L_all the States ; 
but upon no pretence, however plausible, without**" 

It is strongly provided by the Articles of Confederation (with 
out which they would never have been acceded to by the differ 
ent States) that " each State retains its sovereignty, freedom and 
independence, and every jurisdiction and right, which is not by 
this Confederation expressly delegated to the United States in 
Congress assembled." Yet the claim of Congress to the unap 
propriated lands is founded upon the assertion that the sov 
ereignty of Great Britain hath, on the present Revolution, 
descended to them, as representatives of all the States, though it 
is as clear as the sun at noonday, that it has not descended to 
them, but remains to each individual State, respectively, in its 
own right, by whom alone it can be safely exercised. This doc 
trine of sovereignty, teeming with oppression, and striking at 
the vitals of American liberty, has been eagerly patronized by 
Congress, and echoed by P[ain]e, W[harto]n, and every mer 
cenary party-scribbler. 

Posterity will reflect with indignation that this fatal lust of 
sovereignty, which lost Great Britain her western world, which 
covered our country with desolation and blood, should even 
during the contest against it, be revived among ourselves, and 
fostered by the very men who were appointed to oppose it ! 

There is not a single word in the Articles of Confederation 
giving Congress a power of limiting, dividing, or parcelling out 
any of the thirteen States, or of erecting new ones. The four 
teenth article declares that " Canada acceding to this Confedera- 



30 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

tion, and joining in the measures of the United States, shall be 
entitled to all the advantages of this Union, but no other colony 
shall be admitted into the same, unless such admission be agreed 
to by nine States." This evidently relates to the other British 
colonies of Nova Scotia and the Floridas, neither of which is to 
be admitted into the Union, without the concurrence of nine 
States. Yet under color of this article, Congress assumes 
the power of curtailing and dividing the different States, of 
depriving them of territory for the benefit of the United States 
(directly contrary to the Confederation), of demanding cessions, 
and of erecting new States. There is no power whatsoever which 
they may not with equal propriety arrogate to themselves, and 
pretend to derive it from the Articles of the Confederation. Did 
the different States view this subject impartially, as they ought 
no little jealousy, envy, or pique to any particular State, no local 
or party views would induce them to connive at innovations and 
unwarranted assumptions of power, which if continued, must end 
either in the dissolution of the federal Union or the destruction 
of American liberty. To show, therefore, the total absence of 
power in Congress on this occasion, and to expose the danger of 
their usurping it, I should conceive a very useful part of the work 
confided to the committee ; and preserving good manners and 
decency of language, I think the subject can hardly be too freely 
treated. 

It is worthy of observation that the arguments against the 
chartered title of Virginia to the country on the north-west side 
the Ohio, if they prove anything, will prove it part of the new 
British province of Quebec or Canada. Because by an act of 
Parliament in the latter end of 1773, or the beginning of 1774, the 
boundaries of the province of Quebec or Canada were extended 
so as to include the whole country between the Ohio and the 
Mississippi rivers ; and this being done before the separation of 
the colonies, or the Declaration of Independence, when we pro 
fessed ourselves British subjects, and acknowledged the obligation 
of their laws, except on the subject of taxation, the authority of 
Parliament to make the said act can not be impeached upon any 
other ground than the title of some of the old colonies, under 
their charters, to the country so included ; and that the British 
government had no right to add to their new province of Quebec 



THE VIRGINIA CHARTERS. 31 



what had been, long before, solemnly granted to others. Aware of 
this, and to prevent too sudden an alarm or opposition, a proviso 
was inserted in the act, saving to the other colonies the lands 
within their respective charters. If, therefore, Congress taking 
upon itself the insidious and dangerous work of curtailing the 
boundaries of the different States, should set aside the title of 
Virginia, and Virginia acquiesces in it, that country will thence 
forward be placed in the same predicament with the undisputed 
part of Canada, and the other British provinces of Nova Scotia, 
and the East and West Floridas ; and what claim or demand 
could the United States or any of them, have upon it, unless they 
can conquer and hold it by force of arms ? Or upon a negotiation 
of peace with Great Britain, what argument could we fairly urge 
for contracting the lately extended boundaries of Canada and 
reducing it to its former limits ? Or what would any neutral or 
mediating power probably say to us upon such an occasion ? The 
consequences of suffering a British colony to surround great part 
of the United States, and extend itself between them and the 
numerous tribes of western Indians, are too obvious to need 
explanation ; and this subject is the more important, as it may 
easily be foreseen that settling the bounds of Canada will be one 
of the most difficult objects of a treaty. 

I have not by me the copies of the Virginia charters in 1606 
and 1609, or I should have made some remarks on them, endeav 
oring to show that Payne s construction of them is capricious and 
absurd, as several of his other strictures are, and some of them 
founded in misrepresentation and falsehood ; that the description 
and boundaries are intelligible, and admit a natural and easy con 
struction, the charter of 1609 confirming and enlarging, not 
destroying that of 1606 ; that though the Virginia Company was 
dissolved, and the government resumed by the crown, the charter, 
so far as the settlers and their posterity are interested, or affected, 
remains valid, and among other things, the covenant in the char 
ter of 1606, that no new colony should be settled to the westward, 
which seems to have been one of the causes of the great western 
extension of the second charter, whereby the repetition of the 
former clause became unnecessary ; that the ancient method of 
granting lands, established by the Virginia Company in virtue of 
their charter, always continued under the king s government ; 



32 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

that the charter granted to the colony of Virginia in 1667, by King 
Charles the second, has reference to the country described in the 
former charter of 1609, and by recognising and confirming the 
ancient custom of granting lands for the importation of inhabi 
tants, the privileges of the people, and the jurisdiction of the 
colony, has forever barred the crown from dismembering the 
colony, or refusing to grant lands to persons coming hither to 
settle, or importing others ; that the crown has always considered 
the charter of 1667 in this light, and acted accordingly, until the 
present reign, when all reverence to law and justice was thrown 
aside, and a resolution formed to abolish the ancient constitution 
of the colonies, annihilate their charters, and establish despotism 
and slavery in their stead ; that the proclamation of 1763 there 
fore was absolutely illegal and void, as well as the scheme for 
erecting the new province of Vandalia, even if no lands had been 
previously granted, or inhabitants settled beyond the Alleghany 
Mountains. And as to what has been said of the acquiescence 
and approbation of the government of Virginia, the utmost that 
is asserted only shows that the privy-council of Virginia (holding 
their places at pleasure, and totally dependent upon the ministry) 
did not venture to oppose it. 

The charters, I presume, may all be found in the House of 
Delegates office : I had them all in my possession (made up in 
one bundle) when I was formerly appointed to settle some matters 
of jurisdiction in Chespeake Bay and Potomac River with the 
State of Maryland, but our Assembly not thinking it prudent to 
enter into any engagement with that State, while it refused con 
federating, I returned the charters into the House of Delegates 
at the clerk s table. If any of the observations which I have 
scattered up and down, without method or order, will be of use, 
they are very much at the committee s service. And though I 
hope to be excused from taking any particular part in this busi 
ness, for the reasons I have already given, yet if the gentlemen of 
the committee conceive I can be useful to them on any occasion, 
I will wait on them (my health permitting) at any time and place 
they shall be pleased to appoint, for I can truly say there are no 
men in the United States in whom I can more cordially confide, 
or with whom I would more cheerfully act. 

I must entreat them to consider this long epistle as a general

letter, and excuse my not writing to each particular member. I 
must entreat them, too, to proceed in the business, without 
delaying it on account of

George Mason, Jr., was still in France, and John Adams, 
who was in Paris in the winter of 17823 negotiating the 
treaty of peace, mentions in his journal Mr. Mason among 
other Americans to whom he extends his hospitality. The 
following letter from Colonel Mason to his son gives some 
public as well as personal details which are not without 
interest. There would seem to have been a number of 
his countrymen abroad, at this time, in embarrassed circum 
stances, to whom Mr. Mason had given assistance, and 
his father endorses this liberality in the same spirit of open- 
handed sympathy. 

" GUNSTON HALL, January 8th, 1783. 

" As to the money you have spent in Europe, provided you can 
satisfy me that it has not been spent in extravagance, dissipation, 
or idle parade, I don t regard it. It is true, I have a large family

morality and duty, to do justice to them all ; it is certain also 
that I have not lost less than ten thousand pounds sterling by 
the war, in the depreciation of paper money and the loss of 
the profits of my estate ; but think this a cheap purchase of 
liberty and independence. I thank God, I have been able, by 
adopting principles of strict economy and frugality, to keep 
my principal, I mean my country estate, unimpaired, and I have 
suffered little by the depredations of the enemy. I have at this

the distresses of your unfortunate countrymen was worthily 
expended, and you will receive retribution, with large interest, in 
heaven but in order to shorten the time of credit and also to 
entitle myself to some proportion of the merit, I shall insist upon

affairs ; and if there should be a necessity of making you remit

I am now pretty far advanced in life, and all my views are 
centred in the happiness and welfare of my children you will 
therefore find from me every indulgence which you have a right 
to expect from an affectionate parent. 

" I have been for some time in retirement and shall not probably 
return again to public life ; my anxiety for my country in these 
times of danger, makes me sometimes dabble a little in politics, 
and keep up a correspondence with some men upon the public 
stage. You know I am not apt to form opinions lightly and 
without due examination. And I can venture to say that the 
French court and nation may confide in the honor and good faith 
of America. We reflect with gratitude on the important aids 
France has given us ; but she must not, and I hope will not, 
attempt to lead us into a war of ambition or conquest, or trail us 
around the mysterious circle of European politics. We have 
little news worth communicating nothing of consequence has 
happened here this campaign, the enemy having generally kept 
close within their lines, and the American army not strong enough 
to force them. We have a long time expected the evacuation of 
Charlestown, the enemy having dismantled their outworks and 
embarked their heavy artillery and some of their troops. How 
ever, by the last accounts (in December) they had still a garrison 
there. By late accounts from Kentucky, we are informed that 
General Clarke, with twelve hundred volunteers, had crossed the 
Ohio river and destroyed six of the Shawnese towns, destroying 
also about two thousand barrels of their corn and bringing off 
furs and other plunder to the value of three thousand pounds, 
which was sold, and the money divided among his men ; this will

probably drive these savages near the lakes or the Mississippi. 
Upon Clarke s return the Chickasaws sent deputies to him to treat 
for peace. Everything was quiet in the new settlements, and 
upwards of five thousand souls have been added to them since 
last September. The people there are extremely uneasy lest the 
free navigation of the Mississippi to the sea should not be secured 
to them upon a treaty of peace. If it is not, it will occasion 
another war in less than seven years. The inhabitants think they 
have a natural right to the free, though not the exclusive, naviga 
tion of that river, and in a few years they will be strong enough 
to enforce that right."

CHAPTER II. 

THE YEAR OF THE PEACE. 
I783- 

In March, 1783, Colonel Mason addressed a letter to 
General Washington, in behalf of the latter s young kins 
man, Lawrence Washington, of Chotank, who had been 
engaged in a duel with Mr. Philip Alexander, in which 
he had mortally wounded his antagonist. The father of 
Lawrence, whom George Mason designates as u old Mr. 
Lawrence Washington," was evidently the same person to 
whom General Washington left a bequest in his will, speak 
ing of him and his cousin, Robert Washington, as the 
" acquaintances and friends of his juvenile years." They 
were descendants of Lawrence, the brother of Col. John 
Washington. Lund Washington was one of this same 
family. 1 

VIRGINIA, GUNSTON HALL, 

March igth. 1783. 
DEAR GENERAL : 

My motives for troubling your Excellency at this particular 
time are motives of humanity. Mr. Lawrence Washington, Junr., 
who will deliver this has been unfortunately engaged in a duel, or 
rather an affray, with Mr. Philip Alexander of Chotanck ; in 
which his antagonist was mortally wounded and died six or seven 
days after. I have taken some pains to inform myself of the real 
truth of the case, and have seen several testimonials, signed by 

1 "George Washington and Mount Vernon " ; Moncure D. Conway, 
" Memoirs of the Long Island Historical Society," vol. iv. 

36 



LAWRENCE WASHINGTON AND MR. ALEXANDER, 37 

unprejudiced persons of credit, and though Mr. Washington may 
not be strictly justifiable in a legal sense, I am entirely of opinion 
that he has done no more than any man of sensibility and honour 
would have thought himself obliged to do under the same circum 
stances of provocation. Mr. Alexander appears to have been, in 
every instance, the aggressor ; the provocation given Mr. Wash 
ington was of the most interesting and aggravating kind an 
attempt to blast the reputation of a young lady of family and 
character, allied to him by the nearest ties of blood. This is one 
of the few cases which does not admit the usual reparation of 
other wrongs, in a court of justice ; a young lady s character being 
of too delicate a nature to be submitted to such an investigation ; 
and however false the defamation, however generally disbelieved, 
the injury is lasting. The custom of the world, the manners of 
the age we live in, the voice of nature calls upon relations 
and friends to redress an injured person, who from the natural 
weakness and incapacity of her sex is deprived of the means 
of doing it. 

Mr. Alexander after refusing to accept a challenge, and pro 
fessing to act upon the defensive, added fresh injuries to those 
he had already offered, and continued to insult and abuse Mr. 
Washington in the grossest manner ; and when they afterwards 
met at a public place and walked out together, fired his pistol 
first (at not more than a yard s distance) with a manifest intention 
to kill the other, before he knew whether it was Mr. Washington s 
design to act offensively or not ; the ball missed him, though so 
very close that the powder burned his face. Mr. Washington 
instantly stepped back, and drawing a pistol from his belt, under 
his great-coat, shot the other in the body, which brought him to 
the ground. This was done in the sight of many people, and I 
think proves that Mr. Washington, in firing his pistol, acted upon 
the defensive. The only circumstances against him are his for 
mer challenge and his having desired Mr. Alexander, that day, 
to walk aside with him. Upon the whole, though I think Mr. 
Washington may safely stand his trial, and trust himself in the 
hands of an honest and impartial jury, yet he has been judiciously 
advised to absent himself for the present, until men s passions 
and prejudices have subsided, as he must first be tried by an 
examining court in the county where the deceased had many 



38 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



relatives and friends : and the circumstances of Mr. Alexander s 
remaining wounded and his life despaired of, several days before 
he died, during which time most of the neighbors visited him, has 
contributed not a little to heighten the prejudices against Mr. 
Washington. Such spectacles naturally excite our compassion 
and, of course, our resentment against the man who has been the 
cause ; our passions are inflamed too much to consult our reason ; 
and it is not until cool reflection returns that we are capable of 
inquiring into the merits. For these reasons, Mr. Washington has 
determined to pass a month or two in the army, if you shall be 
pleased to permit him to act in it as a volunteer. 

I am well apprized of your Excellency s strict attention to the 
authority of the civil power, and thoroughly sensible how greatly 
and justly it has endeared your character to your fellow-citizens ; 
I should therefore be one of the last men in the world who would 
presume to recommend to your countenance or protection either 
a criminal or a fugitive from justice ; but I think, in my con 
science, that this young gentleman has been rather unfortunate 
than culpable ; and am assured and convinced he means to return 
and submit himself to a fair trial, by the laws of his country ; if 
the friends of the deceased, after due reflection, shall judge fit to 
prosecute him ; which according to the best of my judgment I 
think I should not do, if Mr. Alexander had been my nearest 
relation. 

I can truly declare that I have not the smallest connection, or 
even acquaintance with either of the parties. I own I can t help 
feeling, as a man and as a father, for old Mr. Lawrence Washing 
ton, who is a very worthy man, and is exceedingly distressed by 
this unhappy accident. Your Excellency s permitting his son to 
remain, for a short time, in the army will alleviate his present 
distress, and, in a little time, I hope, he will have nothing to fear. 
I sincerely wish you health, and every felicity ; and with sentiments 
of the highest respect and esteem, I have the honour to be 

Your Excellency s most affectionate and obedient servant, 

G. MASON, 

His Excellency General Washington, 
Head Quarters. 

P. favour Mr. Lawrence Washington, Junr. 1

THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR CONCLUDED. 39 



Thomson Mason, who was employed to defend Mr. 
Washington, also wrote to the Commander-in-chief on the 
same subject, the i/th of March, from " Chappawamsic." 
He enclosed a detailed statement of the difficulty between 
Mr. Lawrence Washington " second son of that very worthy 
man, Mr. Lawrence Washington of Chetauque," and " Mr. 
Philip Alexander, a son of John Alexander of the same 
place." Thomson Mason s letter concludes in these words : 

* Permit me now, sir, to return you my warmest acknowledg 
ments for your very great kindness showed to my son Stevens 
Thomson at the siege of York, of which both my son and self 
retain the most grateful sense. The success of that siege, so 
glorious to your Excellency, gave none of your numerous friends 
more unfeigned pleasure than your Excellency s most obedient 
and most obliged humble servant, 

" THOMSON MASON." 1 

The preliminaries of the treaty of peace were signed by 
the European powers in January, 1783. The Tory ministry 
of Lord North had given place to the Whigs under the 
Marquis of Rockingham. Fox was at the head of the 
foreign department, and Lord Shelburne had charge of the 
colonies. Fox and Shelburne differed on the question of 
the status of the colonies, whether they should be treated as 
already independent, or as made so by the treaty. Lord 
Shelburne supported the latter view, and carried his point. 
It was finally decided, through the suggestion of John 
Adams, that the United States would not require from 
Great Britain a formal declaration of their independence, if 
the same form was used by the British commission treating 
with them as was used in treating with other powers. 8 

Thomson Mason, in a letter to be given later, compares a 
certain party in the Virginia Assembly to the Shelburne 
faction in Parliament. The following letter was written by 
Colonel Mason to Arthur Lee, than in Congress :

40 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

VIRGINIA, GUNSTON HALL, 
March 25, 1783. 

DEAR SIR : 

I thank you for your several favors since I had the pleasure of 
seeing you last, the receipt of which I should have acknowledged 
earlier, but have been a long time disabled, by a very sore finger, 
from holding a pen. 

Since your last of the i2th instant, informing me of the arrival 
of Capt. Barney, &c., I have seen a printed hand bill containing 
the preliminary Articles between Great Britain and the United 
States, and so far as I am able to judge, they are, upon the whole, 
as favorable as America, in her present situation, has a right 
to expect. The grand points are ceded to her, and as for the 
payment of debts contracted before the war, it is no more than 
justice requires, nor do I think it would have been sound policy 
in us to have abrogated them, had it been in our power. The 
far-fetched distinctions which have been attempted to be shown 
between this and other wars would hardly have been approved, 
as understood by mankind in general ; and with what degree of 
faith could the merchants of other nations have trusted their 
effects here, if their private property was in danger of being 
wrested from them and applied to our own use, upon any 
national quarrel, and upon arguments and principles in which we 
should be both judges and parties. There can t, therefore, be a 
stronger proof of the weakness or wickedness of our Assembly, 
than their late instructions to our delegates in Congress. 

I once thought that we ought to risk a long war in order to 
bring the remaining British colonies into our Union, but time and 
reflection have altered my opinion. I have seen that lust of 
power, so natural to the mind of man, prevailing in Congress at a 
much earlier period than could well have been expected. I have 
seen some of the States, from partial, local, temporary views, 
conniving at, and fostering principles which would inevitably end 
in their own destruction. I have seen our legislatures trampling 
under foot the obligations of morality and justice, and wantonly 
invading the sacred rights of their fellow-citizens. It may not be 
amiss to have some rival power at their door, some powerful 
motives to restrain them within the bounds of moderation. It 
will at least be a comfortable reflection, that if our government 
should grow intolerable (which, judging of the future from the 



LETTER TO ARTHUR LEE. 41 



past, is neither impossible nor improbable) a man would have 
some place of refuge, the means of sheltering himself from anar 
chy, ignorance and knavery. But I hope everything from peace. 
I hope then to see our great national council, as well as our 
different assemblies, filled with men of honest characters, and of 
independent circumstances and principles, for until this shall be 
the case, our affairs can never go well. I therefore hope that the 
preliminary articles agreed to by our commissioners at Paris, will 
be ratified by Congress ; that Capt. Barney may return with 
them as speedily as possible ; and that nothing on our part may 
be wanting to hasten so desirable an event, for I presume his 
passport from the King of Great Britain is both in and out. 
I am anxious to hear the determination of Congress upon this 
important subject, and if there is no injunction of secrecy (and I 
don t see why there should) shall be much obliged to you for the 
earliest communication. 

The refugee barges are lately returned, and again plundering 
on the shores of Potomac. One of their crews was lately pretty 
roughly handled by a small party of Northumberland militia. 
They lost two of their rascally officers and a few men, upon 
which they fled with the greatest precipitation. It is a mortifying 
reflection, and accords badly with the ideas of sovereignty and 
independence, that the power of two States is not sufficient to 
protect us from a band of robbers. 

I have lately received two or three letters from Europe, via 
Philadelphia, every one of them broken open and sealed up again 
there, or at some of the intervening post-offices, as almost all the 
letters I have had these two years past from Europe have been. 
The post-office is a considerable tax upon the people ; under proper 
regulations and in honest hands, it would be a great convenience 
and benefit to the public, but by such vile practices as these it is 
likely to become a nuisance to society. If Congress fails to put 
it under better regulations, or don t compel the postmaster- 
general to be more circumspect in the appointment of his 
deputies, the different States will soon be under the necessity 
of taking it out of their hands into their own. 

I sincerely wish you health, and am with great esteem and 
respect, 

Dear sir, your most obedient servant, 

G. MASON.

Captain Joshua Barney, the celebrated naval hero of the 
Revolution, had sailed for France the preceding November 
carrying despatches to Dr. Franklin, and he had returned 
now with the welcome preliminaries of peace, and also with 
a loan of money from the French king. 

The Virginia Assembly met in May, and was confronted 
with the important issues of the peace, as they affected Vir 
ginia and her section, as also with matters of internal gov 
ernment, and the powers of the Federal Congress. George 
Mason wrote to two of his friends in the Assembly, William 
Cabell and Patrick Henry, on the same day, asking them for 
their interest in support of a project of his son s, Thomson 
Mason, jr. Colonel Mason discusses public affairs in these 
letters, and, as was natural, writing them both at one sitting 
probably, he uses the same language frequently to his two 
correspondents. But there is a sufficient variety in their 
contents to warrant the publication of both letters, 

FAIRFAX Co., GUNSTON HALL, 
DEAR SIR : Ma y 6th &gt; 1783- 

I congratulate you most sincerely, upon the establishment of 
American liberty and independence. Happiness and prosperity 
are now within our reach ; but to attain and preserve them must 
depend upon our own wisdom and virtue. I hope the Assembly 
will revise several of our laws, and abolish all such of them as are 
contrary to the fundamental principles of justice. This and a 
strict adherence to the distinctions between right and wrong for 
the future, is absolutely necessary, to restore that confidence and 
reverence in the people for the legislature, which a contrary con 
duct has so greatly impaired, and without which their laws must 
ever remain little better than a dead letter. Frequent interference 
with private property and contracts, retrospective laws destructive 
of all public faith, as well as confidence between man and man, 
and flagrant violations of the Constitution must disgust the best

LETTER TO WILLIAM CABELL. 43 

and wisest part of the community, and occasion a general deprav 
ity of manners, bring the legislature into contempt, and finally 
produce anarchy and public convulsion. 

I write to you with the freedom and sincerity of a friend, 
knowing that you detest such measures as much as I do. They 
drove me out of the Assembly, with a thorough conviction that 
it was not in my power to do any manner of good. The love of 
my country is not extinguished by it, and if I recover tolerable 
health, and have just cause to think I can do any essential public 
service, I shall return again into the legislature. 

We are told here that the present Assembly intend to dissolve 
themselves to make way for a general convention to new model 
the Constitution. Will such a measure be proper, without a 
requisition from a majority of the people ? If it can be done 
without such requisition, may not the caprice of future Assemblies 
repeat it from time to time, until the Constitution shall have lost 
all stability, and anarchy introduced in its stead ? Or at any rate, 
will it not be better to defer it a year or two, until the present fer 
ment (occasioned by the late sudden change) has subsided, and 
men s minds have had time to cool ? We are very much alarmed, 
in this part of the country, least the Assembly should pass some 
laws infringing the Articles of Peace, and thereby involve us in a 
fresh quarrel with Great Britain, who might make reprisals upon 
our shipping or coasts, without much danger of offending the late 
belligerent powers in Europe, but I trust that more prudent and 
dispassionate councils will prevail. 

One of my sons and one William Allison have lately erected a 
snuff manufactory in this county, and have already made a large 
quantity of snuff, which they intend to send soon into different 
parts of the country. Fearing the attempts of the British mer 
chants [to send] such a manufacture here, they have presented a 
petition to the Assembly, for laying a duty upon snuff imported 
from foreign countries. The reasons for this are fully stated in 
their petition, which I beg the favor of you to examine, and if you 
think their request just and reasonable, I natter myself they will 
be favored with your interest in the General Assembly. 

I am with much respect and esteem, Dear sir, 

Your most obedient servant, G. MASON/ 

To Col. William Cabell.

FAIRFAX COUNTY, GUNSTON HALL, 

DEAR SIR : Ma ? 6 I783 

Although it is a long time since I had the honor of hearing from 
you, I reflect, and ever shall reflect, with pleasure on our former 
acquaintance and the proofs I have experienced of your esteem 
and friendship. I have enjoyed but indifferent health since I 
retired from public business : should I recover a better state of 
health, and have just cause to think I can render any essential 
public service, I shall return again to the Assembly. 

I congratulate you most sincerely on the accomplishment of 
what I know was the warmest wish of your heart, the establish 
ment of American independence and the liberty of our country. 
We are now to rank among the nations of the world, but whether 
our independence shall prove a blessing or a curse, must depend 
on our own wisdom or folly, virtue or wickedness ; judging of the 
future by the past, the prospect is not promising. Justice and 
virtue are the vital principles of republican government ; but 
among us a depravity of manners and morals prevails to the 
destruction of all confidence between man and man. It greatly 
behooves the Assembly to revise several of our laws ; to abolish 
all such as are contrary to the fundamental principles of justice, 
and by a strict adherence to the distinctions between right and 
wrong for the future to restore that confidence and reverence in 
the people for the legislature which has been so greatly impaired 
by a contrary conduct, and without which our laws can never be 
much more than a dead letter. It is in your power, my dear sir, 
to do more good and prevent more mischief than any man in this 
State ; and I doubt not that you will exert the great talents with 
which God has blessed you in promoting the public happiness and 
prosperity. We are told that the present Assembly intend to dis 
solve themselves, in order to make way for a general convention 
to new-model the constitution of government. Will such a 
measure be proper without a requisition of the people ? If it can 
be done without such requisition, the caprice of future Assemblies 
may repeat it from time to time until the stability of the constitu 
tion is totally destroyed and anarchy introduced in its stead. Or 
at any rate will it not be better to defer it a year or two until the 
present ferment (occasioned by the late sudden change) has sub 
sided and men s minds have had time to cool ? 



LETTER TO PATRICK HENRY. 45 

The people in this part of the country are made very uneasy by 
the reports we have from below, that the Assembly will make 
some laws or resolutions respecting British debts which may 
infringe the articles of the peace, under the mistaken idea that 
Great Britain will not risk a renewal of the war on account of 
such an infraction of the treaty. We see by the late public papers 
that the terms of peace with America are so strongly censured in 
both houses of Parliament, that it has occasioned or will occasion 
a total change in the ministry. A new ministry averse to the 
treaty, or even the ministry who concluded it, might resent or 
avenge any infraction of its provisions in any particular State, by 
reprisals upon the ships or coasts of such State, or by sending 
two or three frigates to intercept their trade, without danger of 
involving themselves in a new war ; for the power of war and 
peace and of making treaties being in Congress and not in the 
separate States, any such act would be considered as an unwar 
rantable assumption of power in the State adopting it ; and we 
have no reason to expect that either the late belligerent powers in 
Europe, or even the American States in general, would make a 
common cause of it. It is easy to foresee that, in such an event, 
our situation would be neither safe nor honorable. Had it been 
in the power of the American commissioners (which it certainly 
was not) to have abolished the British debts here, it would have 
been but short-sighted policy to have done so. The far-fetched 
arguments which have been used to show the distinction between 
this and other wars, would not have been approved or compre 
hended, by the bulk of mankind ; and with what degree of confi 
dence would foreign merchants have ventured their effects here, 
if upon any national quarrel they were liable to confiscation ? 
I could have wished, indeed, that some reasonable time had been 
allowed for the payment of the British debts, and that the interest 
on them had been relinquished. As to the first, the desire of the 
British merchants to reinstate themselves in their trade here will 
probably prevent their pressing their debtors, and as to the last, 
their bond-debts only will carry interest. It is notorious, that the 
custom of giving interest upon common accounts was introduced 
by the partiality of the merchants of whom the jurors at the 
general court were chiefly composed for several years before the 
late Revolution. Under our present circumstances, I think the 



46 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON, 

accounts of the British creditors may be safely trusted to the 
Virginia juries without any interposition of the legislature. In 
conversation upon this subject we hear sometimes a very absurd 
question : " If we are now to pay the debts due to British mer 
chants, what have we been fighting for all this while ? " Surely 
not to avoid our just debts or to cheat our creditors ; but to 
rescue our country from the oppression and tyranny of the British 
government, and to secure the rights and liberties of ourselves and 
of our posterity, which we have happily accomplished. The min 
istry in Great Britain and the Tories here have indeed constantly 
accused us of engaging in the war to avoid the payment of our 
just debts ; but every honest man has denied so injurious a charge 
with indignation. Upon the whole we have certainly obtained 
better terms of peace than America had cause to expect ; all the 
great points are ceded to us, and I cannot but think it would be 
highly dangerous and imprudent to risk a breach of it. 

The people here too are greatly alarmed at a prevailing notion, 
that those men who have paid the British debts into the Treasury 
in depreciated paper money, instead of making up the real value 
to their creditors, will now attempt to throw the difference upon 
the shoulders of the public and raise it by taxes upon the people. 
I should hope that such an iniquitous scheme will be rejected 
with the contempt it deserves. If it is adopted it will probably 
cause some violent convulsion ; the people being determined, in 
many parts of the country, to form associations against it, and to 
resist the payment of any taxes imposed on them for discharging 
the private debts of individuals. 

I hope the Assembly will, as soon as they meet, postpone the 
collection of taxes (which by an act of last session were to be 
paid in this month) until August or September ; the war being 
ended, the delay will occasion no material inconvenience to the 
public, and though it will not diminish the revenue a shilling, it 
will lessen the taxes upon the people 100 % by enabling them 
to pay with one half the tobacco or other produce which it 
would at this time require. If the people are compelled to pay 
immediately, the merchants taking advantage of their necessity 
will keep down the price of tobacco in a manner that may affect 
the market through the whole season ; whereas if the collection 
of taxes be postponed, the people will be under no necessity of

selling until the arrival of a great many ships has increased the 
demand, and raised the price of country produce. In short, the 
immediate collection of the taxes will, in a great measure, deprive 
the people of the benefits of peace this year. 

One of my sons and one William Allison (who have in partner 
ship erected a snuff manufactory in this county) have presented 
a petition to the Assembly for laying a duty upon snuff imported 
from foreign countries ; the reasons in support of it being fully 
stated in their petition, I will not trouble you with a recapitulation, 
but beg the favor of you to examine the petition, and if you think 
it just and reasonable I natter myself it will have your support 
and patronage. My son George (who is still in Europe) desires 
me to present his most respectful compliments to you, with his 
thanks for the testimonial you were so kind as to give him under 
the seal of the commonwealth ; it has been of great service in 
recommending him to the notice of many gentlemen of rank and 
fortune. I have lately received a letter from him dated Paris the 
2oth February, in which he gives very strong hints of great 
duplicity in some articles of European politics, such as, he says, 
he does not care to venture upon paper that is to cross the 
Atlantic, but shall reserve the communication until he arrives in 
America, which he expects will be about the middle of July ; and 
he concludes with the following expression : " I wish America 
would put her trust only in God and herself, and have as little to 
do with the politics of Europe as possible." He tells me our old 
friend Mazzey [Mazzei ?] was then in Paris and preparing to 
return to America. 

I have reason to apologise for this long letter, but I hope your 
candor will excuse it and ascribe it to its true cause, the unfeigned 
esteem and regard with which I am, dear sir, 

Your affectionate and obedient servant, 

G. MASON.

minds were in a " ferment " through the " late sudden 
change." This was no time for remodelling the State con 
stitution George Mason felt. What Virginia s duties were, 
and what the crisis demanded from her representatives in 
the Assembly, Colonel Mason states clearly and forcibly in 
"The Address and Instructions of their Constituents" to 
Alexander Henderson and Charles Broadwater, the delegates 
from Fairfax County at this time. Though no names are 
signed to this paper there can be no doubt, to those who are 
familiar with his style and his opinions, that George Mason 
was the writer of it ; and as the leading citizen of his county, 
and on so many previous occasions its spokesman, the pre 
sumption is most natural that the like office was assigned to 
him at this time. 

" May 3Oth, 1783. 
" GENTLEMEN : 

" We have committed to you the greatest and most sacred trust, 
which a free people can repose in any of their fellow-citizens ; 
the care of our dearest and most important interests, the protec 
tion of our rights and liberty, and the power of making, on our 
behalf, those laws by which we are to be governed, and this com 
monwealth preserved in safety and prosperity. And although we 
confide thoroughly in your integrity and attachment to the public 
good, yet we judge it expedient, at this critical and important 
season, to communicate to you our sentiments, and to exercise our 
undoubted right of instructing you, as our immediate Representa 
tives in the Legislature. 

" And first, Gentlemen, we desire and expressly instruct you, that 
you give not your assent to, and on the contrary, that you oppose, 
to the utmost of your power, the smallest infraction of the late 
Treaty of Peace, either with respect to the payment of debts, or 
in any other matter whatsoever, whereby the public faith, sol 
emnly pledged by the American Commissioners duly authorized, 
may be violated, and this country again involved in the calamities 
of war, or the danger of reprisals. 

"We also direct and instruct you, that you use your utmost 
endeavors to enact a law for repayment of the principal and 
interest to each and every individual, who hath paid paper money 



INSTRUCTIONS TO DELEGA TES IN THE ASSEMBL Y. 49 

into the public treasury, in discharge of debts due to British 
creditors, according to its real value in specie, to be adjusted by 
the legal scale of depreciation, at the time each sum was respect 
ively placed in the Treasury ; and that such debts, as well as all 
other private debts and contracts, be thereafter left to the common 
course of the laws of the land. And in case of any division of the 
House, upon either of these subjects, or upon any other important 
matter, whereby the rights of the people, and the safety of the 
Commonwealth may be endangered, the maxims of justice contra 
vened, or the fundamental principles of the Constitution violated ; 
we desire and instruct you to call for and cause to be published, 
the yeas and nays upon the state of the question, that so the 
people may, at least, be enabled to distinguish their country s foes 
from its friends, and hereafter to separate the tares from the corn. 

" We desire and instruct you, that you give not your assent to, 
and that you firmly oppose, granting any exclusive privileges or 
advantages in our trade, to any particular kingdom or nation, other 
than what may be stipulated in the Commercial Treaties con 
cluded by the authority of Congress, it being the true and per 
manent interest of America to admit the trade of all nations, upon 
equal terms, without preference to any, further than the goodness 
and cheapness of their commodities may entitle them to. 

" We desire and instruct you that you give not your assent to, and 
that you oppose, any further occlusion of the Courts of Justice ; 
as withholding the due and regular administration of justice 
in any country, must loosen the bonds of society, corrupt the 
morals of the people, and tend to produce anarchy and public 
confusion. 

" We desire and instruct you to oppose all future emissions of 
paper money ; all interference of the Legislature in private con 
tracts, they being properly cognizable in the judiciary departments 
of the State ; all ex post facto laws, except such only as are war 
ranted by the greatest emergencies, and the plain principles of 
justice ; and that you endeavour to procure a revisal or repeal of 
all laws, which may have been heretofore made, contrary to such 
principles. 

" We desire and instruct you to oppose any further delay in the 
collection of this year s taxes than will be absolutely necessary to 
give the people the benefit of this summer s market, for their com-

5&lt;3 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



modities now on hand ; all such delays being highly injurious to 
public credit. 

" We desire and instruct you to promote a strict enquiry into the 
expenditure of public money, and the bringing to speedy account 
and punishment all public delinquents and defaulters. 

" We desire and instruct you to endeavour to procure ample jus 
tice to the officers and soldiers of the American army ; who though 
constantly surrounded with uncommon distress and difficulties, 
have so bravely defended the rights and liberties of their country. 

" We desire and instruct you that you assent not to, and that you 
oppose repealing the law for preventing extensive credits upon open 
accounts ; and also that you assent not to, but oppose the imposi 
tion of any greater duty upon imported iron or cordage than shall 
be imposed upon other imported goods, for the reasons respectively 
given in our petitions to the Assembly upon these subjects. 

" W T e desire and instruct you strenuously to oppose all encroach 
ments of the American Congress upon the sovereignty and juris 
diction of the separate States ; and every assumption of power, 
not expressly, vested in them, by the Articles of Confederation. 
If experience shall prove that further powers are necessary and 
safe, they can be granted only by additional articles to the Con 
federation, duly acceded to by all the States ; for if Congress, 
upon the plea of necessity, or upon any pretence whatever, can 
arrogate powers not warranted by the Articles of Confederation, 
in one instance, they may in another, or in an hundred ; every 
repetition will be strengthened and confirmed by precedents. 

" And in particular we desire and instruct you to oppose any 
attempts which may be made by Congress to obtain a perpetual 
revenue, or the appointment of revenue officers. Were these 
powers superadded to those they already possess, the Articles of 
Confederation, and the Constitutions of Government in the 
different States would prove mere parchment bulwarks to 
American liberty. 

" We like not the language of the late address from Congress 
to the different States, and of the report of their committee upon 
the subject of revenue, published in the same pamphlet. If 
they are carefully and impartially examined, they will be found 
to exhibit strong proofs of lust of power : They contain the same 
kind of arguments which were formerly used in the business of 



CONGRESS NO POWER TO LEVY TAXES. 51 



ship money ^ and to justify the arbitrary measures of the race of 
Stuarts in England. And the present king and council of Great 
Britain might not improperly adopt great part of them, to prove 
the expediency of levying money without consent of Parliament. 
After having reluctantly given up part of what they found 
they could not maintain, they still insist that the several States 
shall invest the United States in Congress assembled with a power to 
levy, for the use of the United States, the following duties, &c., and 
that the revenue officers shall be amenable to Congress. The very 
style is alarming. The proposed duties may be proper, but the 
separate States only can safely have the power of levying taxes. 
Congress should not have even the appearance of such a power. 
Forms generally imply substance, and such a precedent may be 
applied to dangerous purposes hereafter. When the same man, or 
set of men, holds both the sword and the purse, there is an end of 
liberty. As little are we satisfied with the resolution of Congress 
of the loth of October, 1780, lately renewed, engaging that the 
unappropriated lands that may be ceded or relinquished to the 
United States by any particular States, shall be disposed of for the 
common benefit of the United States. Who is to judge of the 
quality and legality of pretended appropriations ? And will this 
vague resolution be a sufficient bar to Congress against confirming 
the claims under Indian purchases, or pretended grants from the 
Crown of Great Britain, in which many of their own members are 
interested as partners, and by which great part of the ceded lands 
may be converted to private, instead of public purposes? The 
intrigues of the great land companies, and the methods by which 
they have strengthened their interest are no secret to the public. 
We are also at a loss to know whence Congress derives the powers 
of demanding cessions of lands and of erecting new States before 
such powers have been granted them by their constituents. 

" And finally we recommend it to you (for in this we will not 
presume to give positive instructions) to endeavour to obtain an 
instruction from the General Assembly to the Virginia delegates in 
Congress, against sending ambassadors to the courts of Europe ; 
it being an expence which (in our present circumstances) these 
United States are unable to support. Such appointments can 
hardly fail of producing dangerous combinations, factions, and 
cabals, in the great council of America. And from the great 



52 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

distance and the difficulty of knowing and examining their con 
duct, there is danger, too, that some of the persons so sent, may 
be corrupted and pensioned by the courts where they reside. We 
are of opinion, that consuls to superintend our trade (at less than a 
tenth part of the charge of ambassadors) will be sufficient to 
answer every good purpose. And nature having separated us, by 
an immense ocean, from the European nations, the less we have to 
do with their quarrels or politics, the better. Having thus, Gentle 
men, given you our opinions and instructions, upon such subjects 
as we deem at this time most important, we remain, with senti 
ments of great respect and esteem, your friends and fellow- 
citizens." 

Thomson Mason was in the Assembly during this session, 
and his views upon public affairs were given to his con 
stituents in the following letter : 

To the Freeholders of Stafford County : 

RICHMOND, June loth, 1783. 
GENTLEMEN : 

I return you my sincere thanks for the confidence you have 
placed in me, in electing me a delegate to represent you in the 
General Assembly ; and I shall now, in return, lay before you the 
views and motives which induced me to offer myself a candidate at 
your late election. It is needless to assert, that no private interest 
of my own actuated me, because from your acquaintance with me 
from my youth, you know it did not. The fears of some of you, 
that I would endeavour to prevent the Treaty of Peace from 
being ratified, or the payment of British debts, were groundless ; 
no man was more desirous of a peace, or entertained a more fixed 
regard for the strict rules of justice than myself, and my disposition 
is not vindictive ; but I think the safety of my country depends 
upon excluding from the rights of citizenship those who joined the 
enemy and not only deserted us in the hour of distress, but by 
their arms and false councils assisted our enemies in prolonging 
the war against us. And those who remained among us, and 
avowed principles incompatible with American liberty, I think also

THOMSON MASON TO HIS CONSTITUENTS. 53 



ought never to be trusted with any office, civil or military, nor 
even to be allowed to vote for any man who is to guide our public 
councils. I wished also to suspend all executions on judgments 
obtained for debts contracted before the war, so as to issue for 
one fourth or fifth part of the debt annually, till the whole was 
discharged, in order to place the debtor as near as we could in the 
same flourishing situation that he was when that debt was con 
tracted ; for I really dreaded, that if Tory and refugee creditors 
were suffered to return and harass their debtors with that rapacious 
and vindictive spirit which we have reason to suppose they will, 
that those citizens who had been most active in defence of the 
liberties of their country would be the devoted victims of their fury, 
and in the present scarcity of money, great part of the property of 
this country would centre in the hands of the avowed enemies to 
liberty ; and as power is the constant, the necessary attendant on 
property, that after all the struggles of the virtuous, the wicked 
would at last prevail, and introduce a more slavish dependence 
upon Britain than that from which we have just emerged. 

I wished also to prevent the money paid into the Treasury, 
either for British debts or loans, from being accounted for on any 
other terms, than at the real depreciation at the time it was paid 
in. I wished to introduce some regular system into our revenue 
laws, so as to pass several distinct laws establishing separate sub 
stantial funds ; first for the support of our civil government, 
secondly, for the annual payment of the interest of our foreign 
debt, thirdly, for the payment of the annual interest of the debt 
due to the army, and fourthly, for that due to our own citizens ; 
that these funds should be most sacredly applied to the separate 
purpose for which each was designed, and the overplus go towards 
sinking the principal of each ; and I was not without hopes that 
the increase of our inhabitants, commerce, and wealth would be 
so rapidly great, that the excess of each fund would pay off that 
principal in less than twelve years. 

I wished to encourage the culture of hemp, by giving a bounty 
to the makers of it, and laying such a duty on imported cordage 
as would pay that bounty, that we might not be altogether de 
pendent upon foreigners for the means of fitting out vessels, either 
for necessary defence or the extension of our commerce. 

And I wished to place our bay and river trade, and above all 



54 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

our fisheries, on such a foundation, as to render them useful 
nurseries of free seamen ; on the increase of which our naval 
strength and the extension of our commerce so materially 
depend. 

Whether I shall succeed in all or any of these views, I shall be 
better able to inform you when I return ; in the meantime think 
me not guilty of inconsistency, if you find by the journals that I 
should often vote against measures which by them seem to be 
proposed by myself ; for where there are a large number to 
deliberate upon any measure, in which a majority are to agree, 
the measure is often so altered as to make it exceedingly different 
from what it was first intended to be. 

I am, gentlemen, with the highest sentiments of gratitude and 
esteem, your sincerely affectionate, 

THOMSON MASON. 

The great question before the Assembly, in the estimation 
of Madison, Jefferson, and Joseph Jones was the report on 
the federal impost. The duty law passed at a previous ses 
sion had been repealed, it was said through the agency of 
the Lees, Richard Henry, and Arthur, but it was now hoped 
that it would be re-enacted. Jefferson wrote to Madison, 
on the 3d of May, giving a somewhat cynical sketch of the 
House, and the attitude of its prominent members in regard 
to the articles proposed by Madison covering this subject. 
The Lees were against them : " Henry, as usual, is involved 
in mystery " ; Thomson Mason " is a meteor whose path 
cannot be calculated. All the powers of his mind seem at 
present to be concentrated in one single object the pro 
ducing a convention to new-model the State constitution. 
This is a subject much agitated, and seems the only one they 
will have to amuse themselves with till they shall receive 
your propositions." 2 Joseph Jones hurried from his seat in 
Congress to attend the Assembly, and he wrote regularly to 
Madison while in Richmond to report the progress of affairs. 
Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee he describes as the 

1 Virginia Gazette, June 14, 1783. 

2 Bancroft s " History of the Constitution," vol. i., Appendix, p. 310. 



JEFFERSON AND JOSEPH JONES. 55 



" two great commanders " in the House, but he intimates 
that there is too much said and too little done. On the 2 1st 
of June he wrote : 

" We are now as usual putting to sleep many of the bills that 
have employed our time and attention for great part of this ses 
sion. Among them two, one for the benefit of debtors, the other 
for regulating the proceedings in the county courts. These were 
thought to have some connection and ought to rest together. Mr. 
Mason introduced and patronized the debtors bill. I was not in 
the House when it was read, but understand it allowed all 
creditors to obtain judgment, but suspended execution, rather 
permitted it for a fifth of the debt annually, for five years, 
comprehending as well foreign as domestic credits. I came 
into the House during the debate and from the observations of 
R. H. L [ee] and those who opposed the bill its principle was 
severely reprobated. Mr. Mason and C. M. T. [Charles Minn 
Thruston] warmly supported it and pronounced it indispensably 
necessary to preserve the people from ruin and the country inde 
pendent. The disposition of the members, however, was so 
prevalent for lopping off all business not really necessary that the 
latter gentlemen were obliged to submit to its being referred to 
the next session. This bill, at least so far as respected British 
creditors, would have had more advocates but for the late period 
at which it was introduced, and because there already existed and 
will continue in force until the ist of December a law that pro 
hibits suits for or on account of British subjects." 

A letter from Thomson Mason to John Francis Mercer, 
half-brother to George and James Mercer, and at this time 
in the Continental Congress, gives a graphic account of 
Virginia politics, and brings before us in lively colors the 
aspect of the Assembly which was just about to close its 
session. 
MY DEAR SIR : RICHMOND, 22d June, 1783. 

I must entreat your forgiveness in having so long neglected to 
answer your very obliging favor of April, but have really been so 
much engaged in the duties of my profession, and the business of 
" Letters of Joseph Jones," p. 120. 



56 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

the public, that I have scarce had a moment s leisure. Add to 
this the very infirm state of my health, and at times the total dis 
ability of my better hand, and you will be convinced that my 
silence proceeded not from any disrespect, for believe me, sir, I 
esteem you as I ought. 

I thank you most sincerely for the very interesting intelligence 
you gave me, of which I endeavoured to avail myself to promote 
the public good, though I am sorry to say to little purpose, as the 
Shelborne faction, as I have christened them, are yet very power 
ful though they lose ground. 

-I never saw the provisional Treaty of Peace till I reached Gar- 
rard s, in my way to this place, and did not determine upon the 
part I afterwards took on that occasion, till I knew whether I 
could prevail on my son who was here to declare himself for Lou- 
don, and till I had consulted your brother whether it might not 
interfere with your election. The result of these conferences 
ended in both my son and myself writing up to our respective 
counties, that we would serve if they chose us. In my letter to 
my son John which I desired him to make public, I expressed my 
wishes that all my friends would also be yours, and was not with 
out hopes that we should both have been elected, and we certainly 
should have been so, but a particular party, having made several 
unsuccessful attempts to raise you up an opponent, had after I 
left the county, prevailed on young Col. Garrard to set up in 
professed opposition to you, in partnership with Col. Carter. He 
rode from house to house in the county, and supported by Col. 
Carter prevailed upon many to promise him, even before my in 
tentions were known. Notwithstanding this, if our election had 
been managed properly you would have run Col. Carter hard ; 
but instead of our staunch friends (which actually formed a 
majority of those present) pushing us both from the beginning, 
which they ought to have done, as both the other candidates were 
our professed enemies, they only pushed in such who were only 
for one of us, and they giving one vote, some to Garrard and some 
to Carter, added to those who were their staunch friends, run 
those gentlemen so far ahead that our friends began to be appre 
hensive we should both be dropped, and Garrard having declared 
that he would resign his pretensions if you were withdrawn, out 
witted your friends so far as to withdraw you, expecting by so 



THOMSON MASON TO JOHN FRANCIS MERCER. 57 

doing that I should then be certainly elected, as Garrard would 
then withdraw. But here they found themselves deceived ; Gar 
rard and Carter still continued to push their elections, and my 
friends threw their votes upon Carter till they got me about a 
dozen votes ahead of Garrard, who finding he had not another 
vote resigned, and upwards of thirty of my friends then thought 
it unnecessary to vote at all, not duly considering that this might 
possibly have overturned my election in case of a controversy. 
Your old friend Col. Mountjoy quarrelled with his brother-in-law 
on account of his conduct in setting up in opposition to you. 
Thus I have given you a particular account of the election as 
stated to me, for I was not there ; if I had [been] I think you 
would have run my colleague hard ; if not have turned him out, 
though many untruths, and the inconvenience of serving in Con 
gress and Assembly, were I am told urged much to your prejudice. 

The Assembly have passed an act to render members of Con 
gress ineligible in future for the Assembly. I fancy some maneu 
vering was intended to your prejudice in the ballot for members of 
Congress. It was the general sense of gentlemen without doors, 
that there would be no election till the November session ; but 
upon my going up to defend Mr. Lawrence Washington of King 
George (who was discharged from further trial for the death of 
Mr. Alexander) the House in that week proceeded to ballot for 
members of Congress, and you were not even put in nomination 
for some time, which my son Stephens perceiving, got so far the 
better of his false modesty, as to propose you, and afterwards 
supported your interest warmly without doors. Mr. Jefferson, 
Mr. Hardy, yourself, Dr. Lee and Col. Monroe were elected. It 
was lucky for Dr. Lee that the election came on so soon, as I am 
told the part he took two days afterwards against a French ship, 
which having been seized through the ignorance of the captain, 
he petitioned for the interposition of the Assembly and obtained 
it, against the violent opposition of several who always have been 
staunch Whigs. Dr. Lee joined in this opposition, and by so 
doing gave great umbrage to many who had before voted for him, 
as a delegate to Congress, but declared they would never do so 
again. So much for private intelligence. 

I am really alarmed at the critical situation we stand in with 
Great Britain, and the more so from their refusal to deliver up to 



58 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

several of the citizens of this State their slaves, when demanded 
under the authority of the Executive, by their respective masters, 
in direct violation of the Treaty. I cannot entirely agree with 
you in your sentiments on the subject of British debts. The occlu 
sion of the courts of justice by any law, would certainly be a legal 
impediment, but still I think that even this might be justly done 
without infringing the treaty, if we made no distinction between 
the British and domestic creditor, for every country has an in 
herent right of regulating her internal police, and surely where 
there is no discrimination, a British sovereign has no right by the 
law of nations, to expect, much less to demand greater privileges 
from us for his subjects than we grant to our own citizens. And 
the present situation of our country is such, that the justice we 
owe our citizens, renders it necessary to place them before they 
are called upon to pay their debts, in the same situation they were 
in when those debts were contracted. Under this idea I drew and 
introduced a bill for the relief of debtors, and another for the 
security of creditors. Under the last I placed our courts in such 
a situation as to enable the creditor in all cases where no defence 
could be made, to obtain a judgment in six months at the farthest, 
and in all other cases in fifteen months. By the first bill I enabled 
all debtors upon giving an additional security, who were also to 
be liable to execution upon the judgment against the principal, in 
case of non-payment, to pay off the judgments when obtained in 
five annual payments ; the judgments to carry interest, and remain 
in force for six years without being revived by Set: fa., and an 
execution to issue annually for one fifth of the judgment, and 
interest against principal and security, till the whole was dis 
charged. All interest during the war was to cease, and no debts 
to be affected by this act contracted after the passing of it ; with 
a proviso that it should not extend to any debts contracted with 
foreigners during the war by individuals. 

These laws being for the mutual advantage of debtor and cred 
itor, and a mere regulation of our internal police, in which the 
British subject was placed on the same footing with our own 
citizens (indeed the word British was not even mentioned in the 
bill) nor any kind of distinction set up, I well hoped would have 
gone down ; but the Shelborne faction were apprehensive it might 
possibly give umbrage to Britain, and induce them to infringe the 



BILL FOR THE RELIEF OF DEBTORS. 59 

treaty. They put off the consideration of the first bill to the next 
session of the Assembly, and I myself moved for putting off that 
for speedy trials to the same time, and after a pretty warm oppo 
sition succeeded. 

We have also been warmly engaged upon a bill to declare who 
should in future become citizens of this State. The bill as I 
had modelled it (for it was first brought in with great severity 
and too little discrimination) excluded all persons who being resi 
dents of the United States after the Declaration of Independence 
had aided and assisted the enemy, from ever becoming citizens 
or residing amongst us for any longer or other time than was or 
should be stipulated in the provisional articles or definitive treaty 
of peace ; that all others who either left us or, remaining amongst 
us, had avowed principles inimical to the independence of America, 
should be incapable of holding any post, civil or military, of sit 
ting in either House of Assembly, of voting at any election, or of 
participating in our councils for the preservation of that indepen 
dence which they had endeavoured to prevent. Here again the 
Shelborne faction took the alarm, and the threat of being here a 
week longer when harvest was approaching, induced a ma 
jority to postpone the consideration of this also till the next 
session of Assembly, for which, as I had the yeas and nays taken, 
I fancy their constituents will not thank them much on their return. 

The plan proposed by Congress for placing in their hands a 
permanent fund for the discharge of the federal debt was rejected 
by a great majority as a precedent dangerous to liberty upon 
this principle, that as we had already entrusted them with the 
sword, if we were to give them the purse also, the control we should 
afterwards have over them would be but a feeble barrier against 
future encroachments ; for such was the lust of power, that who 
ever was in possession of it would still endeavour to extend it, 
and though we should even change our members of Congress 
annually it would be immaterial to us whether we chose A. B. C. 
or X. Y. Z., since every letter of the alphabet, whilst they were 
members of any body, would endeavour to support and extend 
the power of that body, and I candidly confess, my friend, that I 
joined with the majority in this opinion. Yet sensible of the 
necessity of establishing funds, we have laid an impost of five per 
cent, ad valorem and the duties recommended by Congress ex- 



60 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON, 

actly agreeable to their idea of this matter, as to the quantum, but 
it is to be collected by our own officers, and paid by them to the 
Congressional receiver, who is to give a receipt for it, to be car 
ried to our account and credited to this State upon a future 
settlement, and this is to continue till the whole debt is dis 
charged. But this act is not to be applied to this purpose until 
the other States have passed laws similar to it. This fund it is 
calculated will amount to forty-thousand pounds, and we have 
added to it our whole land tax, which amounts at this time to 
ninety-five thousand pounds annually, and will be an increasing 
fund as our back lands are rapidly settling. This tax is to be 
paid by the sheriffs to our treasurer and by him paid to the Con 
tinental receiver, who is to give a receipt for the same, and carry 
it to our credit on a future settlement ; and if these funds should 
fall short, the deficiency is to be made good out of the slave tax, 
which amounts to one hundred and twenty thousand pounds 
annually, but as we do not expect that this last fund will ever be 
called on, in aid of the others, we have ventured to appropriate 
part of the slave tax to other purposes. That I may be perfectly 
understood upon this subject, the duties upon imposts and the 
land tax are appropriated to Congress till the whole of the Con 
tinental debt is discharged, without having any other regard to 
this State s particular quota of that debt than to have credit at a 
future settlement of what we may pay more than our quota 
amounts to. 

Without regard to our internal police of revenue we have 
passed a law to establish a fund for paying the annual interest of 
the certificates granted our officers and soldiers, and the principal 
at eight annual payments, the first payment to be made the first 
day of January, 1786. To do this we have laid an additional tax 
of id. per bushel upon salt, # 2 /per ct. on imported hemp, i/perct. 
on imported cordage, i / per Ib. on imported snuff, 4d. per gal 
lon on imported spirits, 6 per gallon upon wine, a duty upon tea, 
sugar and some other articles which I do not recollect, and 5 / 
per hogshead on tobacco.% [Mr. Mason makes this marginal note : 
" N. B. I think the articles marked thus # ought not to have 
been taxed, because the first being a necessary of life will fall 
heavy upon the poor especially in the back parts where it will 
raise the price of salt even in Loudon to 7 or 8/ and in coun- 



VIRGINIA S FUNDS AND LIABILITIES. 6 1 

ties further back to double that sum, and tobacco is an export."] 
This it is thought will amount to thirty thousand pounds. The 
deficiency is to be made good by the slave tax. It is presumed 
that a fund of seventy thousand pounds will answer the ends pro 
posed by this law. 

For my own part I think this law an unwise one, because no 
new tax ought ever to be appropriated to any purpose but to the 
contingent charges of government, till experience has evinced that 
the commodity taxed will bear it with convenience, and some 
certain estimate can be made of what it will produce, as when it 
is once appropriated to a permanent fund it cannot afterwards be 
discontinued, however inconvenient, without a breach of public 
faith. I should therefore have been better pleased that the whole 
seventy thousand pounds had been drawn from the State tax, 
and these duties appropriated to the contingent charges of gov 
ernment, and then they might have been altered hereafter as 
experience might have convinced us was necessary. Besides 
there not being a particular portion of the slave tax fund set 
apart for this use, and the civil list, the deficiencies to Congress 
and the deficiency to the officers and soldiers, all being quartered 
upon that fund, without pointing out what proportion of it shall 
be applied to each, will introduce confusion ; some creditors will 
get all, some none, and our credit be thereby impaired, for I am 
convinced our funds are amply sufficient, but from want of sys 
tem and method in that department alone, all our distresses 
arrive. To illustrate this I will state the true situation of our 
debts and funds as nearly as I can from memory, which though 
not strictly right will be nearly so.

We yesterday received the report from a committee to whom 
was referred Mr. Simon Nathan s claim to a large quantity of 
tobacco, under an award given by some gentlemen in Philadel 
phia to whom it was submitted by our delegates in Congress at 
the request of the governor. The committee had voted it 
reasonable, upon a supposition that the State was bound by the 
acceptance of the bills by the governor, and the award in Phila 
delphia ; but it appearing manifestly that the bills were drawn 
for paper currency at a depreciated value, only equal to ^"1500, 
though the bills were for ^ 13,000, and that the governor had 
actually paid 200,000 tobacco at 25 per ct., a large majority 
refused to pay more, upon this principle, that the governor being 
deceived or even mistaken at the time of his acceptance, that 
acceptance was not binding for more than was actually due ; and 
it appearing upon the face of the award, that the arbitrators were 
mistaken in the matter of fact, viz. that they were drawn for 
specie value the State was not bound by it, since that would be a 
sufficient foundation for setting aside an award in any court of 
judicature. The matter is again to be referred to arbitrators in 
Maryland. 1 

Thus I have now given you a particular account of all our public 
affairs worth mentioning. And now let me ask my young friend 
if none of the young ladies of Philadelphia have had influence 
enough with you to resign the name given you by some ladies in 
Prince William ? I presume you have heard that your acquaint 
ance my son Stephens was married the first of May. He and his

lady (formerly Miss Polly Armistead) who are both in town, pre

Adieu my dear sir, and believe me to be 

Your sincerely affectionate 

THOMSON MASON. 

George Mason wrote from " Gunston Hall," the 2/th of 
August to Messrs. Hunter, Allison, and Company, merchants 
in Alexandria, a letter of business relating to his tobacco 
sales, and in a postscript he gives the news he had lately 
received from Europe. " I have a letter," he writes, " from 
my son George, dated in Nantes, June 2Oth, where he has 
been waiting six or seven weeks for a passage in the Hannibal, 
Capt. Cunningham. He says the definitive treaty is proceed 
ing slowly, on account of the difficulties of adjusting matters 
with the States-General. The court of London, have in the 
meantime made provision by proclamation, for a commercial 
intercourse with the United States of America. The Al- 
gerines have fitted out a small fleet on purpose to cruise 
against American vessels, notwithstanding the Emperor of 
Morocco s orders to his Admiral. I very much suspect this 
a British intrigue to discourage our trade in the Mediterra 
nean." 

General Greene, returning from the South in the fall of 
1783, records in his diary the incidents of his journey. 
Near Dumfries his carnage was overturned, and he was 
much bruised. But he spent an agreeable evening there 
at Colonel Grayson s, and dined on the I3th of September 
at " Mount Vernon." At Alexandria he was taken ill with 
fever, which prevented him from accepting the public din 
ner the citizens wished to give him. He writes from Alex 
andria : 

" R. H. Lee and many others came to see me, but I was too 
unwell to enjoy company, and most part of the time to see any. 
. . . Colonel [name illegible] and his son William, an amiable 
youth, was to see me, and carried off Major Hyrne on a visit to 

1 MS. Letter. 



64 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

Mr. Mason s, where one of the young ladies made a great impres 
sion on his heart." 1 

This was probably Colonel Mason and his son William 
Mason. 

At the meeting of the Assembly in October, General 
Nelson presented a bill to invest the United States with 
a power to lay certain duties for the use of the United 
States. This power of taxation was the one the States least 
liked to entrust to Congress, but an urgent public necessity 
eventually forced the measure from them. On the 26th of 
November, the speaker laid before the House a letter from 
Edmund Randolph, respecting the proceedings of the per 
sons appointed to vindicate the title of Virginia to western 
territory, stating the progress made in that business. Rives, 
in his " Life of Madison," says of the work appointed the 
committee that it does not appear the task was ever exe 
cuted. A defence, however, was prepared, as would appear 
from this letter of Edmund Randolph to the Speaker of 
the House. In it he speaks of the difficulty of getting the 
committee together, and adds : 

" Mr. George Mason has already, however, perused aitd 
approved about a third of the composition. If the General 
Assembly will therefore permit the work to go into print under 
the correction of Mr. Mason and myself, we may probably be 
able soon to concert the measures necessary for its publication, 
as I shall see him on my way to Alexandria about the 24th 
of next month, whither I am going on business of Mr. Nathan." * 

On the 8th of December the House resolved : 

" That the delegates of this State to the Congress of the United 
States be instructed and fully authorized to convey, by proper 
instrument, in writing on the part of this State to the Congress 
of the United States, all right, title and claim, which the said 
Commonwealth hath to the lands northward of the Ohio, upon

the terms contained in the act of Congress of the thirteenth 
September last : Provided that lands be reserved out of these 
hereby proposed to be ceded sufficient to make good the several 
military bounties agreed to be given to sundry officers by resolu 
tions of both Houses of Assembly : the lands hitherto reserved 
being insufficient for that purpose." 

And on the I5th Joseph Jones presented a bill in accord 
ance with this resolution. 1 This cession was accepted by 
Congress and, as Hinsdale says in his able work on this 
subject, it ended the long struggle between Virginia and the 
States in Congress opposed to her rights, leaving Virginia 
substantially victorious. She retained, as she had desired, 
the lands now forming the States of Kentucky and West 
Virginia, " the territory south-east of the Ohio, the sole 
question at issue." 5 In the interests of peace and union, 
Virginia had made a generous gift to the Confederacy. She 
parted with two hundred and seventy thousand, five hundred 
and fifty square miles of territory, which by its sale since to 
private individuals has enriched the Federal treasury to the 
extent of more than a hundred million of dollars. 3 George 
Mason, as has been seen, first sketched the terms of this 
cession, and by his influence, in and out of the Assembly, 
aided in securing its adoption by his State. 

What Colonel Mason thought of the measures of the 
Assembly at this session we learn through a letter from 
Madison to Jefferson, written after his return from Congress 
then sitting at Annapolis : 

"ORANGE, December roth, 1783. 



" I took Col. Mason in my way, and had an evening s conver 
sation with him. I found him much less opposed to the general 
impost than I expected. Indeed he disclaimed all opposition

ginia, in direct violation of the Constitution, and erected into a new State,

to the measure itself, but had taken up a vague apprehension, 
that, if adopted at this crisis, it might embarrass the defence of 
our trade against British machinations. He seemed, upon the 
whole, to acquiesce in the territorial cession, but dwelt much on 
the expediency of the guaranty. On the article of a convention 
for revising our form of State government, he was sound and 
ripe, and, I think would not decline a participation in the work. 
His heterodoxy lay chiefly in being too little impressed with 
either the necessity or the proper means of preserving the 
Confederacy." l 

Jefferson wrote to Madison from Annapolis on the follow 
ing day, making anxious inquiries as to the sentiments of 
the recluse at " Gunston" on the subject of the State 
Constitution : 

" You have seen G. M. I hope, and had much conversation 
with him. What are his sentiments as to the amendment of our 
constitution ? What amendments would he oppose ? Is he 
determined to sleep on, or will he rouse and be active ? I 
wish to hear from you on this subject." 2 

His compatriots were all desirous to know George Mason s 
views, and to see him back again in public life. Joseph 
Jones wrote to Jefferson on the 2gth of December in regard 
to the British debt question and other important subjects 
that would come before the Assembly at its next session. 
And he feared the abilities of this body would not be equal 
to the trust : " Madison s aid I think we may depend on " ; 
he adds, " perhaps old Mr. G. Mason s, as the business of 
the land offices requires revision, and his apprehensions on 
that subject, if nothing else, may draw him from his retire 
ment." 3 

Washington resigned his commission in December, and 
left Annapolis in time to reach " Mount Vernon " Christmas- 
eve. From a young lady s letter, Miss Lewis of Fredericks-

burg, probably the daughter of Colonel Fielding Lewis, 
General Washington s brother-in-law, we obtain a lively pic 
ture of the home-coming of the chief and the attendant 
festivities. And the foremost figure among the guests was 
Colonel Mason, whose appearance is pleasantly portrayed 
by the pen of his fair young admirer : 

" I must tell you what a charming day I spent at Mount Ver- 
non with Mama and Sally. The general and madame came home 
on Christmas Eve, and such a racket the servants made, for they 
were glad of their coming ! Three handsome young officers 
came with them. All Christmas afternoon people came to pay 
their respects and duty. Among them were stately dames and 
gay young women. The general seemed very happy, and Mis 
tress Washington was busy from daybreak making everything as 
agreeable as possible for everybody. Among the most notable 
of the callers was Mr. George Mason, of Gunston Hall, who was 
on his way home from Alexandria, and who brought a charming 
granddaughter with him, about fourteen years old. He is said to 
be one of the greatest statesmen and wisest men in Virginia. We 
had heard much of him and were delighted to look in his face, 
hear him speak, and take his hand, which he offered in a courtly 
manner. He is straight in figure but not tall, and has a grand 
head and clear gray eyes. He has few white hairs, though they say 
he is about sixty years old." l

CHAPTER III. 

VIRGINIA S COMPACT WITH MARYLAND. 

1784-1787- 

The following letter, found among Monroe s papers, 1 is 
believed to have been written by him to George Mason, to 
whom the younger statesman had applied for advice on the 
several important public questions before the country. Mon 
roe was at this time in Congress at Annapolis : 

"ANNAPOLIS, February, 1784. 
" DEAR SIR : 

"Your favor of the 5th ultimo did not reach me till a few days 
since from the difficulty the severity of the season hath created 
in passage of the rivers. I am particularly happy to receive it as it 
promises to me, in the office which I hold, the aid of your age, 
judgment and experience. I have paid great attention to your 
reasoning, and think that in two instances, viz., the peace estab 
lishment and the seat for the residence of Congress, it is conclu 
sive. If no European power had possessions on the continent I 
should suppose the idea of a standing army would never have 
been brought upon the carpet. The Indian incursions or trade, 
as you observe, would more regularly come within the cognizance 
of the State exposed or to derive advantage from it. But the 
possessions of these powers, and particularly of Great Britain, is a 
matter of more serious import. The impolicy of New York hath 
already thrown a considerable body of people into Nova Scotia ; 
and Canada, in tracts at present uninhabited, is certainly capable

JAMES MONROE TO GEORGE MASON. 69 

of maintaining extensive settlements. Many European countries, 
in a higher northern latitude, are thickly settled, and the lands of 
Canada are perhaps richer than those of the Swiss Cantons, Den 
mark, Sweden or Russia. These provinces are also well tim 
bered, and at the same time that the inhabitants promise to be an 
hardy and robust race of men give them all the advantages from 
their situation of a nursery for seamen, dock-yards for building 
ships and a share in our carrying business. 

" The court of London hath turned its attention to the Indies, 
proposing to attempt such arrangements as may compensate to the 
nation the loss of America. But what can Great Britain promise 
[herself] from the Indies which she doth not now possess. If 
colonies are established upon the footing we lately stood, and 
emigration is encouraged, how long will they be connected with 
the parent country ? And will not such establishments which 
take the Indies out of the Company induce the necessity of stand 
ing armies and respectable fleets to prevent insurrection, and 
turn the tide of commerce into the bosom of the parent country, 
and will not this expense be thrown upon the state ? And as the 
climate suits a despotic government, and the general in com 
mand may be popular with his troops, is it not rational to suspect 
he will seek the sovereignty himself ? If these questions could 
be answered in the negative, I think it will be granted that the 
possession of India will only prove a commercial advantage. The 
inhabitants of these provinces will have but little attatchment to 
the parent country, and will personally be never brought to add 
to its number or increase its strength in any European operation, 
While this trade and government are in the possession of a com 
pany, the nation is free from the expense of these troops or fleets. 
Considering therefore all the relative circumstances, I think it a 
doubtful question whether this change would be of public advan 
tage, while most certainly it would prove very materially injurious 
to the Crown. The Crown now has the advantage of the sale 
occasionally of the renewal of the charter to the Company, and 
of this it would of course be deprived. I think therefore the 
conclusion just that the monopoly of the trade and expense of 
the government will remain with the Company, and that any 
arrangement the court of London may make with respect to that 
country will only tend to create dependants on the Crown and

of Britain as we will in the East and I cannot see how in any 
event any arrangements can turn to any great national advantage. 
Will the population of India increase the number of British citi 
zens ? Will any Eastern arrangement increase the fleet or add to 
the army but to guard itself ? I am therefore of opinion that if 
the court of London are wise they will be cautious how they 
interpose in the affairs of the East. 

" I am therefore of opinion that the Court of London will still 
turn her attention to this continent in every consideration she 
may have in view to add to or increase her national strength. 
Passion or folly may sometimes govern her councils, but in time 
she will observe her error and attempt to correct the fault. I 
think as national advantages are to be derived from it, she will 
turn her attention to these provinces, and there is a kind of 
energy in the natives of that country which is not to be found in 
the peasantry of any of the monarchies of Europe. When any of 
the countries are overstocked in France or Spain the overplus 
turn beggars in the street or starve ; but the people of England 
seek a dwelling in foreign climes and distant countries. I suppose, 
therefore, these provinces will prove a drain to the surplus of 
citizens in Great Britain. What will be their policy with respect 
to these provinces, whether they will extend to them the freedom 
of the British Constitution, or keep in them a standing army, be 
this as it may, will it not be a desirable circumstance to us to 
prevail on them to keep few or no troops in Canada ? Will not 
this be a proper subject for a convention between us ? But 
if they will not acceed to it, I still think with you that the 
defence of the country should be thrown on the militia." 1 

Colonel Mason s friends in Fairfax County were anxious 
to see him again in the Assembly, and some of them, it 
seems, in the spring of 1784 were about to take a step that 
would force him to re-enter the Legislature, as they hoped. 
Against this proceeding he made a vigorous protest in a 
letter to his friend Mr. Cockburn, declaring that it was an 
infringement of his personal liberty :

COLONEL MASON AND THE COUNTY ELECTION. 71 

GUNSTON HALL, April 18, 1784. 
DEAR SIR : 

I have been lately informed that some people intend to open a 
poll for me at the election to-morrow in this county. I hope this 
will not be offered for I have repeatedly declared that I cannot 
serve the county at this time as one of its representatives. I 
should look upon such an attempt in no other light than an 
oppressive and unjust invasion of my personal liberty, and was I 
to be elected under such circumstances I should certainly refuse to 
act, be the consequences what they may. I mention this to you 
in your official capacity as high sheriff of the county, and if a 
poll is demanded for me I must request the favor of you to 
inform the people publicly of my resolution, and that such a 
demand is made against my consent or approbation. If ever 
I should see a time when I have just cause to think I can render 
the public essential service and can so arrange my domestic con 
cerns so as to enable me to leave my family for any length of 
time, I will most cheerfully let the county know it, but this is not 
the case in either instance at present. 

Your affectionate and obedient servant, 

G. MASON. 

Others besides his constituents, as we have seen, wished to 
recall George Mason to the councils of the State. Madison 
and Jefferson were still urging changes in the Virginia Con 
stitution. Madison wrote to his friend on this subject 
March i6th : " Much will depend on the politics of Mr. 
Henry which are wholly unknown to me. Should they be 
adverse, and G. Mason not in the Assembly, hazardous as 
delay is, the experiment must be put off to a more au 
spicious conjunction." 1 After the opening of the session 
he writes from Richmond, deploring Jefferson s departure to 
Europe at this time, and adds in regard to the contemplated 
revision of the Constitution: " As Col. Mason remains in 
private life, the expediency of starting the idea will depend 
much on the part to be expected from R. H. Lee and Mr. 
Henry."

72 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

In the meantime though George Mason was no longer 
in the Assembly, his State had some work for him to do 
which he could not refuse to undertake. On the 28th of 
June the following resolution was introduced in the House 
of Delegates : 

" Whereas great inconveniences are found to result from the 
want of some concerted regulations between this State and 
the State of Maryland, touching the jurisdiction and naviga 
tion of the river Potomac ; Resolved, That George Mason, Ed 
mund Randolph, James Madison, jun., and Alexander Henderson, 
Esqrs. be appointed commissioners ; and that they, or any three 
of them, do meet such commissioners as may be appointed on 
the part of Maryland, and in concert with them frame such liberal 
and equitable regulations concerning the said river, as may be 
mutually advantageous to the two States ; and that they make 
report thereof to the General Assembly." 

Questions of trade and revenue were much discussed at 
this session, and the subject of the British debts still agitated 
the Assembly and the people. Should the treaty of peace 
be carried out in all its provisions, while the British still held 
the western posts, was asked. At the fall session of 1784-5 
the subject was renewed in the Assembly, and through Madi 
son s influence, provision was finally made for payments of 
British debts in seven annual instalments. But the House 
adjourned before the bill was acted upon, and the matter 
remained practically unsettled until after the adoption of 
the Federal Constitution. Other subjects of interest to 
Colonel Mason brought before this Assembly were the assess 
ment plan, and resolutions adding to the duties assigned the 
commission of which he had been appointed a member at 
the previous session. On the nth of November the House 
resolved : " That the people of this commonwealth, accord 
ing to their respective abilities, ought to pay a moderate tax 
or contribution annually, for the support of the Christian 
religion, or of some Christian church, denomination or com- 

1 Journal of the Assembly. 



VIRGINIA" s PROPOSAL TO PENNSYLVANIA. 73 

munion of Christians, or of some form of Christian wor 
ship." Patrick Henry, who favored the resolution, was 
made chairman of the committee appointed to bring in a 
bill on the subject. Those who opposed the assessment, 
with Madison at their head, finally induced the Assembly to 
postpone consideration of the bill until the following Novem 
ber. It was to be published with a record of the votes upon 
it, in handbills, and twelve copies given to each member to 
be distributed in their respective counties, and the people 
were requested to signify their opinion respecting the adop 
tion of such a bill to the next session of the Assembly. On 
the 28th of December the House came to the following 
resolutions : 

" That the commissioners or any two of them appointed on the 
twenty-eighth of June last, to concert with commissioners on the 
part of Maryland, regulations touching the navigation and juris 
diction of the Potomac, be further authorized to unite with the said 
commissioners in representing to the State of Pennsylvania, that 
it is in contemplation of the said two States to promote the clear 
ing and extending the navigation of the Potomac, from tide water 
upwards as far as the same may be found practicable ; to open a 
convenient road from the head of such navigation to the waters 
running into the Ohio ; and to render the waters navigable as far 
as may be necessary and proper : That the said works will require 
great expense, which may not be repaid unless a free use be se 
cured to the said States and their citizens, of the waters of the 
Ohio and its branches so far as the same lie within the limits of 
Pennsylvania. That as essential advantages will accrue from 
such works, to a considerable portion of said State, it is thought 
reasonable that the legislature thereof, should by some previous 
act, engage that for the encouragement of the said works, all articles 
of produce and merchandise which may be conveyed to or from 
either of the said two States through either of the said rivers, 
within the limits of Pennsylvania to or from any place without 
the said limits, shall pass throughout free from all duties or tolls 
whatsoever other than such tolls as may be established and be 
necessary for reimbursing expenses incurred by the State or its

citizens, in clearing, or for defraying the expense of preserving 
the navigation of the said rivers : And that no articles imported 
into the State of Pennsylvania through the channel or channels, 
or any part thereof to be opened as aforesaid and vended or used 
within the said State, shall be subject to any duties or imposts 
other than such articles would be subject to if imported into the 
said State through any other channel whatsoever : That in case 
a joint representation in behalf of this State and of Maryland 
shall be rendered by circumstances unattainable, the said com 
missioners or any two of them, may of themselves make such 
representations on the subject to the State of Pennsylvania, as 
will in such event become proper." J 

We obtain a glimpse of Colonel Mason in domestic life, 
and of the family circle, through a letter to his daughter, 
Mrs. McCarty, on the death of an infant. The original 
letter has been carefully preserved by this lady s grand 
daughter : 

GUNSTON HALL, February loth, 1785. 
MY DEAR CHILD : 

I most sincerely condole with you for the loss of your dear 
little girl, but it is our duty to submit with all the resignation 
human nature is capable of to the dispensation of Divine Provi 
dence which bestows upon us our blessings, and consequently 
has a right to take them away. A few years experience will con 
vince us that those things which at the time they happened we 
regarded as our greatest misfortunes have proved our greatest 
blessings. Of this awful truth no person has lived to my age 
without seeing abundant proof. Your dear baby has died inno 
cent and blameless, and has been called away by an all wise and 
merciful Creator, most probably from a life of misery and mis 
fortune, and most certainly to one of happiness and bliss. 

Your sisters are both at Col. Blackburn s and not expected 
home before Sunday or you should immediately have their com 
pany. Your brother George and his wife are in Chotanck. I 
wish you could come to Gunston Hall. In the meantime I would 
by all means advise you to lose a little blood without delay, and

DEATH OF THOMSON MASON. 75 



to take two or three times a day twenty or thirty drops of spirits 
of lavender of which I send you some by the bearer. I am, my 

dear child, 

Your affectionate father 

GEORGE MASON. 

P. S. Mrs. Mason says your sisters told her they should go 
to Col. Cook s, and would not be at home before the middle of 
next week. She begs that you will come to Gunston Hall. 

" Colonel Cooke " was Travers Cooke, of Stafford County, 
son of Sir John Cooke and grandson of Raleigh Travers. 
Colonel Cooke s son, John Cooke, married Mary Mason, one 
of George Mason s daughters. 

In this same month of February, 1785, Colonel Mason lost 
his brother, Thomson Mason, who died on the 26th, and was 
buried at his place, " Raspberry Plain," in Loudoun County. 
He drew up his will shortly before his death. Bailey Wash 
ington, Jr., was named one of his executors. He describes 
himself as " Thomson Mason of Stafford County in the 
Commonwealth of Virginia Esq. : " He begins with the 
usual solemn formula, giving his soul into the hands of his 
Creator " to dispose of as His justice and mercy shall think 
fit, and I humbly beg," adds the testator, " that through the 
merit and mediation of my blessed Redeemer Jesus Christ 
the manifold sins I have committed in this life will be for 
given, and I declare that I have lived and hope to die in the 
belief of the Christian faith." To his widow, who was his 
second wife, Thomson Mason left all the estate that came to 
him through his marriage with her. She had been a Miss 
Westwood, of Elizabeth City County, and the country-seat, 
" Errol," in that county, which is mentioned in the will, was 
probably her patrimony. She was the widow of Dr. Wallace 
at the time of her marriage with Thomson Mason. Mrs. 
Mason was to receive a life estate in lands of Thomson 
Mason on Chappawamic Run, in Stafford County, lying 
below " lands of the late Mr. Moncure " ; also in another 
plantation on the same run in Prince William County, lying 
below the property of Col. Burr Harrison and Robert Carter, 



76 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

Esq. There were about twelve hundred and twenty acres 
in the two tracts, and the testator reserved out of them for 
his son, John Thomson Mason, his choice of fifty acres, " to 
be laid off in a square for a seat, on which side the run he 
pleases, so that it does not include the garden, orchard, or 
any of the housing in the county of Stafford, or any of the 
low grounds in the same county." John Thomson Mason 
was to fall heir to this Stafford and Prince William property, 
eventually, with other lands in the same counties, amounting 
in all to three thousand acres. This the third son of Thom 
son Mason made his home later in Maryland, where he 
owned a beautiful country-seat in Montgomery County, 
called " Montpelier." He became an eminent lawyer of 
Maryland. Stevens Thomson, the eldest son of Thomson 
Mason, was confirmed by his father s will in his possession 
of " Raspberry Plain," already given him by deed, with the 
plate and furniture belonging to it. He was also to have a 
square of four acres of land on which to build a public-house, 
with certain unimproved lots in the towns of Richmond and 
Manchester, " which were drawn in the late Colonel Byrd s 
lottery, by tickets marked with the initials of his mother s or 
his brother George s name." Stevens Thomson Mason was 
also to have the ground in Richmond " on which the public 
storehouse lately stood," together with the money due from 
the public for its valuation, etc., it having been destroyed 
during Arnold s raid. Other bequests of houses, lots, etc., 
were left to the eldest son. And to the second son, Abram 
Barnes Thomson, his father also left lands in Loudoun 
County, besides town lots drawn in Colonel Byrd s lottery. 

To his only daughter, Ann Thomson Mason, her father 
bequeathed certain slaves and a sum of money. She mar 
ried Richard McCarty Chichester, son of Richard Chichester, 
of " Newington," and a brother of Sarah Chichester, wife of 
Thomson Mason, of " Hollin Hall." Mrs. Mason, by her 
husband s will, was to have the household furniture at 
" Errol " and at " Chappawamsic," with all the stock at the 
former place. She was to have also a chariot and harness 



EXTRACTS FROM HIS WILL. 77 

and four chariot horses well matched ; also the use of certain 
slaves, " Silvia," " Catina," and others. A square of one 
hundred and fifty acres of land in Loudoun County was to be 
laid off in half-acre lots for a town, and sold to the highest 
bidder for a term of twenty-one years, with a ground rent of 
two silver dollars on each lot. The two youngest sons of 
Thomson Mason, the only children of his second marriage, 
were very young at the time of their father s death, and in 
the latter s will, after naming their mother and two of their 
half-brothers as their guardians, he gives the following in 
structions as to their education. He desires " that they may 
be put to learning English at one of their guardian s houses 
till eight years of age, and that then they be kept at writing, 
arithmetic, and reading elegant English authors and modern 
languages till they are twelve years of age, and then to be 
kept at learning the Latin language, book-keeping, mathe 
matics, and other useful branches of literature, till the age 
of eighteen, and then to be put out to such business or pro 
fession as their geniuses are best calculated for." Thomson 
Mason then adds a caution against the temptations of the 
gayer portion of the State. " I positively direct," he says, 
" that neither of my younger sons, Westwood Thomson 
Mason or William Temple Thomson Mason, shall reside on 
the south side of James River or below Williamsburg before 
they respectively attain the age of twenty-one years, lest 
they should imbibe more exalted notions of their own 
importance than I could wish any child of mine to possess." 
Thomson Mason provides watches for each of his children 
by name, except Stevens, who it is presumed was already in 
possession of one. His wife is to have "a new gold watch 
with an embossed case and equipage, suitable for a lady, of 
the price of thirty guineas," purchased for her. His own 
gold watch is to go to the youngest son. Ann Thomson is 
to have the " equipage that was her mother s," and a gold 
watch purchased for twenty guineas to go with it. The 
three other sons are to have each a silver horizontal watch. 
John is to have his father s brass barrelled pistols. 



78 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

A faithful servant was rewarded after the following 
manner : 

" I direct that my negro man Jack be allowed to settle upon 
any of my lands in Loudon, Stafford or Prince William and that 
my executors lay off for him thirty acres of good arable land and 
ten acres of pasturage to tend a crop for himself, build him a barn 
of logs twenty feet square and furnish him one cow, two sows, 
one ewe and a mare of ten pounds value, one bar share plow, one 
Dutch plow, one broad hoe, one narrow hoe, one axe, one mat 
tock, five bushels oats, five baskets rye, five bushels of wheat and 
ten barrels of corn to stock his plantation and set him forward, 
and let him have one month s work of an able negro man and the 
loan of my ox cart for the same time to put his little farm in 
order ; with liberty to get rails and firewood off my adjacent 
lands." 

In addition to the farm and stock, his master gave Jack 
the annual sum of six pounds specie. The use of the land 
was given him for life, the stock forever. He was to be pro 
tected in all his just rights and " subject to the control of no 
person whatsoever, and this provision I have made for him," 
concludes the testator, " as a grateful acknowledgment of the 
remarkable fidelity and integrity with which he has con 
ducted himself to me for twenty years and upwards." Jack 
was to receive also three hundred-weight of pork. To his 
wife s maid, Catina, if ever she should be parted from her 
mistress, her master left her two hundred-weight of pork, 
and certain articles of clothing annually. Certain profits of 
the estate were to be used " in the purchase of white ser 
vants, stocks and improvements." Two " indented farming, 
white servants," who have four or five years to serve, were 
to be purchased for one of the testator s sons, " provided 
they do not exceed the price of thirty pounds each." Thom 
son Mason, like most of the Virginia planters of his day, 
owned thorough-bred horses and took an interest in the turf. 
In his will he leaves to his son, John Thomson, his " riding 
horse Rupert, the young St. George s mare, the two-year-old 



PROTEST OF THE FAIRFAX JUSTICES. 79 

sorrel filly, her year-old Sweeper horse colt, and Camilla and 
her colts." To another son is left, among less distinguished 
steeds, " a bay Tamerlane colt," and to a third son his 
" Eclipse bay horse colt." 

In giving directions for his burial, Thomson Mason makes 
the one allusion to his brother that is found in his will. He 
desires to be buried at " Raspberry Plain," where his son 
George lies, and he wishes the remains of his first wife to be 
brought from " the family burying-ground at my brother s," 
to be laid beside his own. 

George Mason must have felt this loss keenly. But un 
fortunately no letters have been preserved which allude to it. 
And now, while the work of the younger brother was over, 
the elder one was to come forward into the federal arena in a 
way that could have been little dreamed of by either of them 
in 1785. But for two years longer George Mason remained 
out of the Assembly. In the meantime he was not unem 
ployed. Two months after his brother s death we find him 
attending a meeting of the county court of Fairfax, at Alex 
andria, on the 22d of March, and as the presiding justice, 
drawing up a protest against what he conceived to be a vio 
lation of the rights of the court by the executive : 

" 1785, March 22. At a court held for the county of Fairfax. 
"Present: 

" George Mason, John Gibson, 

Charles Broadwater, David Stuart, 

Alexander Henderson, William Payne, 

George Gilpin, (Gentlemen Justices). 

" A new commission for this county, signed by the Hon. Benj. 
Harrison Esq: late Governor of this Commonwealth being this 
day presented and read, whereby the Justices of the county are 
constituted and appointed de novo, and consequently are required 
to take the oath of qualifications over again, notwithstanding they

had before taken them under the commonwealth, and several of 
the justices have been many years acting magistrates, by virtue 
of former commissions, for this county. The court, unanimously 
refuse to receive, and do protest against the same, for the follow 
ing reasons &c. 

" P. WAGENER, Clk. Ct. 

" A copy of the protest to be transmitted to the executive." 

The protest goes on to state that they object to such 
commissions because "of unnecessary multiplication and 
repetition of oaths, rendering them common and familiar, 
etc. Because such a commission would afford a dangerous 
precedent and tend to renew, in this commonwealth, one of 
the many abuses and arbitrary practices of the late monarchi 
cal government here, yielding to the secretary an unnecessary 
fee and to the governor and council an unjust and oppressive 
power of insulting or turning any man out of his office of a 
civil magistrate, as prejudice, malice, or caprice might dic 
tate, without a hearing, or without a cause of complaint 
against him ; for the constituting and appointing the former 
acting justices de novo, necessarily implies the power of 
vacating the former commissions ; that the justices derive 
their office entirely from the last, and consequently, that by 
issuing a new commission, and misplacing any man in it, he 
might lose his rank, and might be degraded from the first to 
the last justice in the county ; or by leaving out any justice s 
name he would thenceforward be deprived of his office, both 
of which, it is notorious, were frequently practised under the 
former government. Because it is conceived that the exer 
cise of such a power is altogether illegal, giving to the execu 
tive power of the State an undue and dangerous influence 
over the courts of justice, directly contrary to the Declaration 
of Rights and to the fundamental principles of our free gov 
ernment. And although this court hath no cause to believe 
that the present commission was issued for any such evil 
purposes, yet we should think we were deficient in the duty 
we owe to our country and to posterity, if we suffered our-

selves to become accessory to establishing a precedent 
evidently tending to introduce them, and by renewing the 
oppressive maxims and practices of the government from 
which we have so lately been rescued by force of arms, 
to sap the foundations of that liberty which has been pur 
chased at the expense of so much blood and treasure." 

In this same month of March the commissioners met at 
Alexandria to settle the jurisdiction of the Chesapeake Bay 
and the Potomac and Pokomoke rivers. Maryland had sug 
gested the time and place of meeting, and her commissioners 
arrived in good season. By some inadvertence, however, 
the Virginia commissioners were not informed when and 
where they were to hold the conference, and on this account 
only George Mason and Alexander Henderson were able to 
be present. By invitation of General Washington the com 
missioners adjourned from Alexandria to " Mount Vernon." 
Ten days before, Washington records in his journal a visit to 
Colonel Mason and some of his neighbors. Finding Law 
rence Lewis, who lived at " Woodlawn," away from home, 
he proceeded to Colonel Mason s, where he " dined and 
lodged," leaving " Gunston Hall " for Mr. Cockburn s, at 
" Springfield," about twelve the next day. On the 2oth, 
the diary relates : 

u Major Jenifer came here to dinner, and my carriage went to 
Gunston Hall to take Col. Mason to a meeting of commissioners 
at Alexandria for settling the jurisdiction of Chesapeake Bay and 
the rivers Potomac and Pokomoke between the States of Virginia 
and Maryland. The commissioners on the part of Virginia be 
ing Col. Mason, the Attorney General, Mr. Madison and Mr. 
Henderson. On that of Maryland, Major Jenifer, Thomas John 
son, Thomas Stone and Samuel Chase, Esqrs." 2 

Two of the Maryland gentlemen had written to George 
Mason that they would stop at his house on their way to 
Alexandria, and they were very probably there at this time.

82 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

On the 24th, General Washington writes : " Sent my car 
nage to Alexandria for Col. Mason according to appoint 
ment, who came in about dusk." The next day, the 
journal continues, about one o clock Major Jenifer, Mr. 
Stone, Mr. Chase, and Mr. Henderson arrived at " Mount 
Vernon." This was Friday. Saturday and Monday the 
commissioners were in session, and Tuesday they all left 
for their homes. Colonel Mason drove back to " Gunston " 
in the " Mount Vernon " carriage, " by the return of which/* 
adds Washington, " he sent me some young shoots of the 
Persian jessamine and Guelder rose." It is a very meagre 
chronicle, and one cannot but wish that some of the table- 
talk at " Mount Vernon " during these four days had been 
preserved for us. The commission, it will be seen, finished 
their work on the 28th, having been four days apparently at 
Alexandria and four at " Mount Vernon." 

On the fifth of April Colonel Mason wrote from " Gunston 
Hall " to General Washington, sending him a present of 
some cider. He had broached, he says, four or five hogs 
heads, and filled the bottles with the best, though there was 
not much difference, " all being made of Maryland red 
streak and managed in the same manner." The cider this 
year is not so clear and fine, he tells his friend, and he does 
not know the reason except that he had ground his apples 
last fall later than usual. And Colonel Mason adds: "As 
the cider in bottles will not ripen for use until late in May, 
I have also filled a barrell out of the same, which I beg your 
acceptance of." He recommends that a little ginger should 
be put in it, as it improves sweet cider ; and he sends Wash 
ington some watermelon seed which he had promised him. 1 
Colonel Mason, in this letter, speaks of suffering again with 
the gout. He had gone back from the convention at " Mount 
Vernon " to the pleasant home interests and occupations, to 
the enjoyment of the rural tastes, which he shared with the 
retired commander-in-chief. But in the meanwhile he was 
preparing also to give an account to the Assembly of the 

1 Washington MSS., State Department. 



LETTER TO MADISON. 83 

work undertaken by the commission. The responsibility of 
its seeming irregularity had fallen upon him, a responsibility 
he would not evade, and which he felt the circumstances 
fully justified his assuming. Joseph Jones, however, only 
expressed a surprise which was natural when he wrote to 
Madison, June I2th, of the rumor that had reached him on 
the subject. He says : " I know not whether any copy of the 
resolution you allude to has been officially communicated to 
Mr. Mason. Such as Beckley copied for the executive have 
been, so whether tJiat should have been of the number I can 
not tell, as we are not yet favored with the journals by the 
printer, and I cannot inform myself at the clerk s office, Mr. 
Beckley being out of town." The Assembly now only met 
once a year, in October, and the resolution referred to was 
probably the one passed at the last session of the House, 
when new powers were delegated to the commission ap 
pointed the previous June. Joseph Jones adds : " I heard, 
but have only heard, that Mason and Henderson proceeded 
to execute the other branch of the business committed to 
the commissioners without the attendance, or call for at 
tendance, of the other commissioners. What they have done 
has not come to my knowledge." 

Madison had already written on the 2d of June to George 
Mason, probably making inquiries on the subject, and the 
latter sent the following letter of explanation in reply : 

" GUNSTON HALL, August 9th, 1785. 
" DEAR SIR : 

" I should have answered your favor of the second of June, long 
ago, had not ill health, and the absence of my sons from home ? 
disabled me from making out the copies of the proceedings of 
the Virginia and Maryland Commissioners which I now enclose, 
and upon which I wish to be favored with your sentiments. 

" We thought ourselves unfortunate in being deprived of yours 
and my friend the Attorney s assistance, in this important busi 
ness ; and nothing but absolute necessity should have induced 
me to enter upon it without you. But the Maryland gentlemen 
" Letters of Joseph Jones," p. 144. 



84 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

would have been much disgusted with a disappointment, after 
attending at such a distance in very bad weather. We waited 
some days expecting your arrival in Alexandria, when I received 
a letter from the Attorney, upon other business, without mention 
ing a word of the meeting, or of the Assembly s appointment. 
This convinced us that there must have been some blunder or 
neglect, in some of the public offices, in not giving the proper 
notification to the Virginia Commissioners. The Maryland gentle 
men declared that nothing had been omitted on their part, that 
they had written an official letter to the Virginia Commissioners 
(addressed by their governor to the commissioners) proposing 
the time and place, if agreeable to them ; and if not, desiring 
they would name some other ; that having received no answer, 
they took it for granted that the time and place was accepted, 
and attended accordingly. 

" So great has been the neglect in some of our public depart 
ments that neither Mr. Henderson or myself had been furnished 
with copies of the Assembly s resolutions. And I should not have 
known that I was one of the persons appointed, had I not by mere 
accident, two or three days before the meeting, been informed of 
it by two of the Maryland commissioners writing to me that they 
should endeavor to take my house in their way, and go with me 
to Alexandria. His Excellency General Washington happened 
to have a copy of the Assembly s resolutions respecting the ap 
plication to be made to the government of Pennsylvania, which 
he very obligingly gave me, by which any two or more of the 
commissioners were empowered to proceed. And it was natural 
for us to conclude that these last resolutions had pursued the 
style of the former respecting the jurisdiction of the two States ; 
as well as that the subject had been taken up upon the same 
principles as in the year 1778, when commissioners were directed 
to settle the jurisdiction of the Chesapeake Bay and the rivers 
Potomac and Pokomoke 1 ; in which sentiments Mr. Henderson, 
from what he was able to recollect of the resolutions, concurred. 

" Thus disagreeably circumstanced, only two of the Virginia 
commissioners present, and without any copy of the resolves upon 
the principal subject, we thought it better to proceed than to dis-

commissioners appointed, 1778.

appoint the Maryland commissioners ; who appeared to have 
brought with them the most amicable dispositions, and expressed 
the greatest desire of forming such a fair and liberal compact, as 
might prove a lasting cement of friendship between the two 
States ; which we were convinced it is their mutual interest 
to cultivate. We therefore upon the particular invitation of the 
General adjourned to Mount Vernon and finished the business 
there. Some time after, Mr. Henderson wrote to Mr. Beckley 
(clerk of the House of Delegates) for a copy of the resolves ; 
upon receiving which we were surprised to find no mention made 
of Chesapeake or Pokomoke River, that our powers were confined 
to Potomac River, and to not less than three of the commissioners. 
I am still inclined to think that the omission of Chesapeake Bay 
and Pokomoke River was owing to a mistake or inadvertence, in 
not attending to the resolves of 1778 ; and, if so, it was perhaps 
lucky that we had not been furnished with a copy of the resolves ; 
for the Maryland commissioners had an express instruction from 
their Assembly to consider the relinquishment, on the part of Vir 
ginia, of any claim of laying tolls, c., on vessels passing through 
the capes of Chesapeake as a sine qua non j and if it was refused 
immediately to break off all further conference with the Virginia 
commissioners. 

" This blundering business, however, will give me the trouble 
and expence of a journey to Richmond, next session, to apologize 
for and explain our conduct ; where, if the substance of the com 
pact is approved by the Assembly, I hope forms will be dispensed 
with, especially as the breach of them has been the fault of some 
of their own officers, not ours, and as I am conscious of our hav 
ing been influenced by no other motives than the desire of 
promoting the public good." 

With this letter George Mason sent to Madison drafts of 
the communication of the Virginia commissioners to the As 
sembly, stating briefly the points that had been settled ; and 
also the letter to the president of the Executive Council of 
Pennsylvania from the commission on the subject of co 
operation with Virginia and Maryland. 2 The following 
memorandum was added as a postscript to the letter to

Madison. The suggested correction or alteration in the 
compact was not made, however, as may be seen by refer 
ence to the law in the Virginia and Maryland codes. 

" Memorandum. The concluding clause of the seventh article 
of the compact is not so clearly expressed as it ought to be, and 
is capable of a construction which was not intended ; and though 
it would be a strained and unnatural one, it had better be re 
moved. The words are provided, &c., and that the citizens of 
neither State shall have a right to fish with nets or seins upon the 
shores of the other. This may be construed to restrain the citi 
zens of either State, having lands upon the river in the other, 
from fishing with nets or seins upon their own shores ; which 
would be unreasonable and unjust , although in its present form, 
it seems to be the grammatical construction. The addition of 
two or three words will set it right thus : And that the citizens 
of neither State shall have a right to fish with nets or seins upon 
the shores of the citizens of the other. I never observed this cir 
cumstance till very lately, or I am sure I could easily have had it 
altered by the Maryland commissioners, at any time before the 
meeting of their Assembly. The fisheries upon Potomac River 
are becoming a very important object, and therefore I could wish 
the above clause in the compact properly amended. If the 
amendment goes no farther than I have mentioned, it will occa 
sion no objection from Maryland, and I wish the article to be no 
otherwise altered, for this was the most difficult business we had 
to settle with the Maryland commissioners. The idea of the 
right of fishing on both shores of Potomac River is one the 
Marylanders are not fond of parting with ; and I trust it will be 
found we have obtained everything for Virginia, with respect to 
Potomac River, which she can desire. The exceptionable part 
of the article before mentioned was really a mistake. Not hav 
ing time now to write to my friend the Attorney upon this 
subject, Mr. Madison will be pleased to mention it to him. 

" And I shall be particularly obliged to Mr. Madison to inform 
me what is done with respect to the Northern Neck, on the sub 
ject of the records in the late proprietor s office, entering, or 
resurveying lands, quit-rents, &c. 



RELIGIOUS ASSESSMENT CONTROVERSY. 8/ 

Another subject which interested George Mason at this 
time was the Assessment Bill. Its fate was to be decided at 
the next session of the Assembly, and so energetically did 
its enemies work against it, its rejection was readily secured. 
To George Mason, in great part, this success was due. 
Madison, in a letter to one of Colonel Mason s grandsons, 
written in 1826, gives the following account of the matter: 

" During the session of the General Assembly, 1784-5, a bill 
was introduced into the House of Delegates, providing for the 
legal support of Teachers of the Christian Religion, and being 
patronized by the most popular talents in the House, seemed 
likely to obtain a majority of votes. In order to arrest its 
progress, it was insisted with success, that the bill should be 
postponed till the ensuing session ; and in the meantime be 
printed for public consideration. That the sense of the people 
might be better called forth, your highly distinguished ancestor, 
Col. George Mason, Col. George Nicholas, also possessing 
much public weight, and some others thought it advisable that 
a remonstrance against the bill should be prepared for general 
circulation and signature, and imposed on me the task of draw 
ing up such a paper. The draught having received their sanction, 
a large number of printed copies were distributed, and so exten 
sively signed by the people of every religious denomination, that at 
the ensuing session the projected measure was entirely frustrated, 
and under the influence of the public sentiment thus manifested 
the celebrated bill Establishing Religious Freedom created 
into a permanent barrier against future attempts on the rights of 
conscience, as declared in the great charter prefixed to the Con 
stitution of the State." 

The fact of Madison s authorship of the " Remonstrance " 
was not generally known until after his death, and there 
were some persons in Virginia who attributed it to George 
Mason. 2 Colonel Mason probably wrote to a number of his 
friends enclosing them this paper for signature, and two of

88 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

these letters, written, the first part of them, in identical 
terms, one to General Washington and one to Robert Carter 
of " Nomini," are preserved. The letter to Washington is 
as follows : 

GUNSTON HALL, October 2cl, 1785. 
DEAR SIR : 

I take the liberty of enclosing you a Memorial and Remon 
strance to the General Assembly, confided to me by a particular 
friend whose name I am not at liberty to mention ; and as the 
principles it avows entirely accord with my sentiments on the 
subject (which is a very important one), I have been at the 
charge of printing several copies to disperse in the different 
parts of the country. You will easily perceive that all manner of 
declamation and address to passions have been avoided, as unfair 
in themselves, and improper for such a subject ; and although 
the Remonstrance is long, that brevity has been aimed at, but the 
field is extensive. 

If upon consideration, you approve the arguments and the 
principles upon which they are founded, your signature will both 
give the Remonstrance weight, and do it honor. I would have 
waited on you personally upon this occasion, but have been so 
shattered by a late violent fit of the convulsive cholic, com 
plicated with the gout in my stomach, that I am hardly able to 
walk across the floor. The bearer will deliver you a packet 
inclosing another copy for my friend Doctor Stuart. I am in 
hopes he and his colleague will endeavor to forward the sub 
scriptions in this county. Mrs. Mason, and the family here, pre 
sent their compliments to you, your lady and Miss Bassett, with, 

Dear Sir, 
Your affectionate and obedient servant, 

G. MASON. 1 

In the letter to Robert Carter, George Mason says : 

" If upon consideration you approve the reasoning and the 
principles upon which it is founded, I make no doubt you will 
endeavor to promote the subscriptions in your part of the 
country ; if they can be completed, and the Remonstrance

CORRESPONDENCE ON THE SUBJECT. 89 

sent down to the Assembly, by the first or second week in 
November, I presume it will be in good time." 

Washington wrote in reply to Colonel Mason : 

MOUNT VERNON, October 3d, 1785. 



I have this moment received yours of yesterday s date, enclos 
ing a memorial and remonstrance against the Assessment Bill, 
which I will read with attention. At present I am unable to do 
it, on account of company. The bill itself I do not recollect 
ever to have read ; with attention I am certain I never did, but 
will compare them together. 

Although no man s sentiments are more opposed to any kind 
of restraint upon religious principles than mine are, yet I must 
confess, that I am not amongst the number of those, who are so 
much alarmed at the thoughts of making people pay towards the 
support of that which they profess, if of the denomination 
of Christians, or declare themselves Jews, Mahometans, or other 
wise, and thereby obtain proper relief. As the matter now 
stands, I wish an assessment had never been agitated, and as it 
has gone so far, that the bill could die an easy death ; because I 
think it will be productive of more quiet to the State, than by 
enacting it into a law, which in my opinion would be impolitic 
admitting there is a decided majority for it, to the disquiet of a 
respectable minority. In the former case, the matter will soon 
subside ; in the latter, it will rankle and perhaps convulse the 
State. The dinner bell rings, and I must conclude with an 
expression of my concern for your indisposition. 

Sincerely and affectionately, I am, &c. 2 

Councillor Carter s answer to George Mason was a more 
emphatic condemnation of the proposed law. He wrote 
from " Nomony Hall," October 15, 1785 : 

" SIR : 

" Your favor inclosing a copy of a Remonstrance and Memo 
rial against a bill for establishing a provision for teachers of the 
Christian religion was put into my hands this day. The violence

offered therein to the Declaration of Rights and the presumptu 
ous aid intended to Christ s visible church below, were very 
alarming and in the month of last June I joined some persons 
in the lower counties in this neck in offering to the people, there, 
a petition addressed to the General Assembly noting therein some 
reasons against the bill and praying that it might be rejected. I 
fully intend to present to the people to-morrow the Remonstrance 
and Memorial." l 

Many of the Virginia statesmen, however, still clung to the 
principle of some compulsory law for the support of religion. 
Edmund Randolph, Patrick Henry, Richard Henry Lee, and 
John Page of " Rosewell," afterwards Governor of Virginia, 
all of them members of the Church of England, favored an 
assessment by the State for this purpose. John Page wrote 
to Jefferson in August, 1785 : " We have endeavored eight 
years in vain to support the rational sects by voluntary con 
tributions/ And the clergy of the former establishment 
were many of them without the means of remaining in their 
parishes. Yet churchmen such as George Mason, Madison, 
and George Nicholas looked beyond the exigencies of the 
hour, and were ready to sacrifice present convenience for the 
sake of the principle involved. And theirs, which was the 
religion of a majority of the landed gentry, was, of course, 
the " rational sect " which suffered most from the new order 
of things. 

Colonel Mason wrote to Washington early in November, 
making reference to the proceedings of the Assembly then 
in session : 

GUNSTON HALL, gth November, 1785. 
DEAR SIR : 

The bearer waits on you with a side of venison (the first we 
have killed this season), which I beg your acceptance of. 

I have heard nothing from the Assembly except vague reports 
of their being resolved to issue a paper currency ; upon what 
principles or funds I know not ; perhaps upon the old threadbare 
security of pledging solemnly the public credit. I believe such

an experiment would prove similar to the old vulgar adage of 
carrying a horse to the water. They may pass a law to issue it, 
but twenty laws will not make people receive it. 

I intended to go down to Richmond about the fifteenth of the 
month to have reported the compact with the Maryland commis 
sioners, but I have lately had so severe a fit of the convulsive 
colic, or the gout, in my stomach, that I dare not venture far 
from home ; it held me from Sunday evening till Tuesday morn 
ing, and has left me so weak that I am hardly able to walk across 
the floor. 

We hope to hear that you, your lady, and family are well ; to 
whom Mrs. Mason and the family here present their best compli 
ments, with those of, dear sir, 

Your affectionate and obedient servant 

G. MASON. 

Washington, in his diary, records a visit made to Colonel 
Mason on the 25th of this month. He writes : " Set out 
after breakfast, accompanied by Mr. G. Washington to make 
Mr. Mason at Colchester a visit, but hearing on the road that 
he had removed from there I turned in to Gunston Hall 
where we dined and returned in the evening." a The two 
friends doubtless discussed Assembly affairs, the Assessment 
Bill, the paper-money question, the commercial compact with 
Maryland, etc. 

Madison had visited " Mount Vernon " early in Septem 
ber and also on the I2th of October, staying until the I4th, 
as we learn from Washington s diary. And it was probably 
on the latter occasion that he went also to " Gunston Hall." 
The constant attacks of illness, of which Colonel Mason 
makes mention in his letters at this time, had prevented him 
from going to Richmond with the report of the commission, 
which he wished to lay before the Assembly, so he was 
obliged to send it in a letter to the Speaker of the House. 
He wrote, about the same time, to Madison :

92 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

GUNSTON HALL, December yth, 1785. 
DEAR SIR : 

I have had such frequent fits of the convulsive colic, compli 
cated with the gout in the stomach, since you were here, that I 
dare not undertake a journey to Richmond ; and therefore, after 
putting it off as long as I well could, in hopes of recovering such 
health as would permit me to present the compact with the State 
of Maryland, in person, I have now inclosed it in a letter to the 
Speaker. I incurred a small expense of ^3 15 9, in waiting 
three or four days in Alexandria for the Maryland commissioners ; 
which the Assembly may repay me if they please, otherwise I am 
very well satisfied without it. I also incurred an expense equal 
to about ^5 in specie, attending the committee upon the revisal 
of the laws in Fredericksburg, and about double that sum in 
Williamsburg, at different times, after the sessions of Assembly 
ended, in collecting evidence, and cross examining witnesses be 
tween the Commonwealth and Colonel Richard Henderson, in 
the cause which I was directed to manage, by a vote of both 
Houses ; but I never made any particular account of it. 

I must intreat you, if you find it necessary, to make my apology 
to the Assembly for having rather exceeded our authority. I gave 
you the reasons in a former letter, soon after the meeting of the 
commissioners ; but least you should not recollect them, I will 
repeat them. . . . My paper draws to an end, and leaves me 
only room to beg your attention to the inclosed memorandum, to 
express my desire of hearing from you on the subject of the com 
pact, and such other public matters as you may have time to com 
municate, as soon as convenience will permit ; and to assure you 
that I am with the most sincere esteem and regard, 

Dear sir, 
Your affectionate friend and obedient servant, 

G. MASON. 1 

On the 1 3th of December the Speaker laid before the 
House a letter from George Mason, Esq., enclosing the pro 
ceedings of the commissioners o n the compact between the 
States of Virginia and Maryland respecting the jurisdiction 
and navigation of the rivers Potomac and Pokomoke ; which 

1 Madison MSS., State Department. 



THE ANNAPOLIS CONVENTION. 93 

were read and referred to the Committee on Commerce, and, 
on the 3Oth, the bill to ratify the compact passed the House. 1 
The compact consisted of a dozen articles on the jurisdiction 
of the Chesapeake Bay and the two rivers mentioned, cover 
ing the items of tolls, fisheries, lighthouses, buoys, piracies, 
etc. And the letter to the Speaker from the Virginia com 
missioners opened up other and wider views of the commis 
sion : such as the regulation of gold and silver money passing 
current in the two States, bills of exchange, etc., duties on 
imports or exports, which it was proposed should be settled 
by an annual commission, appointed by the legislatures of 
the two States, the number of the commissioners to be not 
less than three or more than five from each State. The 
conference at " Mount Vernon," as it proved, was the first 
step in the direction of a new federal government. Mary 
land, in ratifying the compact and supplementary report of 
the commission, proposed that Pennsylvania and Delaware 
should be invited to unite in the same commercial system. 
The Virginia legislature went still further. On the 2ist of 
January, 1786, at the close of the session, the following 
resolution passed the House : 

" That Edmund Randolph, James Madison, Walter Jones, 
St. George Tucker, and Meriwether Smith be appointed com 
missioners, who, or any of them, shall meet such commissioners 
as may be appointed by the other States of the Union at a time 
and place to be agreed on, to take into consideration the trade of 
the United States ; to examine the relative situations and trade 
of the said States ; to consider how far a uniform system in their 
commercial regulations may be necessary to their common inter 
est and their permanent harmony ; and to report to the several 
States, such an act relative to this great object as, when unani 
mously ratified by them, will enable the United States in Congress 
effectually to provide for the same." a

94 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

At first only three commissioners were named, Tucker 
and Smith were then added by the House, and when the 
resolution was sent to the Senate it was amended by the 
addition of three others George Mason, William Ronald, 
and David Ross. Ronald s name was struck out at his own 
desire, but the rest stood. Madison thought that there were 
too many, and that the multitude of associates would " stifle 
the thing in its birth and was probably meant to do so." 1 

There had been much excitement in the Assembly over 
the question of regulating trade ; on the one hand, lest the 
power of the States should be abridged, and, on the other, 
lest the power of Congress should be inadequate to the pur 
poses for which the Union had been formed. Mr. Tyler 
introduced the proposition of a convention at the last 
moment, having vainly sought an earlier opportunity to 
effect his object. To invest Congress with the means of 
regulating commerce, and yet insure certain qualifying 
clauses, it was thought would satisfy both the friends of 
Congress and the upholders of the rights of the States. 
Colonel Mason s opinions on the subject were not clearly 
known. It was suspected that he was adverse to a stronger 
Union, and those who favored it desired to obtain an influ 
ence so important. Monroe wrote to Madison from New 
York, where Congress was in session, on the 3d of Septem 
ber : " I consider the convention of Annapolis as a most 
important era in our affairs. . . . Prevail, I beg of you, 
on Colonel Mason to attend the convention. It will give 
him data to act on afterward in the State." 2 The conven 
tion met on the nth of September, 1786, but George Mason 
did not attend, doubtless on account of the attacks of gout, 
from which he still suffered. Commissioners were present 
from four States only New York, New Jersey, Pennsyl 
vania, and Virginia. Edmund Randolph, Madison, and 
St. George Tucker were the three delegates who at-

FREE NAVIGATION OF THE MISSISSIPPI. 95 

tended from Virginia. The convention adjourned on the 
I4th, proposing that all the States should meet in the 
following May at Philadelphia " to render the Constitution 
adequate to the exigencies of the Union." 

Monroe was uneasy at this time concerning the projects 
of Jay and his party. He saw in them an attempt to break 
up the Union, and he wrote to the prominent men in Vir 
ginia to ascertain and influence their views on the subject. 
In a letter to Madison of the 2Qth of September, he says: 

" I wrote some weeks since to Colonel Mason upon this 
subject, at the time I wrote Governor Henry, but have received 
no answer from him, from which circumstance, as well as that 
of R. H. Lee s being in the opposite sentiment, there is room to 
conjecture he is not with us." 

It was generally taken for granted, it seems, that Lee and 
Mason would concur in their political views. General Henry 
Lee, who was in Congress at this time, also wrote to General 
Washington, incidentally giving his testimony to the con 
sideration in which George Mason was held, and the desire 
that was felt to bring him back into public life. In regard 
to the navigation of the Mississippi, which Spain, in the pro 
jected treaty with her Jay was negotiating, proposed to close 
to the United States for thirty years, he says : " Should this 
matter come before our Assembly, much will depend on Mr. 
Mason s sentiments." And Washington replies on the 3ist : 

" Colonel Mason is at present in a fit of the gout. What 
his sentiments on the subject are, I know not, nor whether he 
will be able to attend the Assembly during the present session. 
For some reasons, however, which need not be mentioned, I am 
inclined to believe he will advocate the navigation of that river." * 

There was another subject on which much was expected 
from George Mason ; this was the question of emitting

paper money. And on the I2th of August Madison had 
written to Jefferson, referring to the action of the several 
States who advocated the measure : " Whether Virginia is to 
remain exempt from the epidemic malady, will depend on 
the ensuing Assembly. My hopes rest chiefly on the exer 
tions of Colonel Mason, and the failure of the experiment 
elsewhere." Bancroft says that aided by an unfavorable 
balance of trade and the burden of heavy taxation, an effort, 
it was known, would be made by Meriwether Smith and 
others to issue a paper medium in 1786: " Aware of the 
danger, Washington insisted that George Mason should be 
a candidate for the Assembly ; and his election proved 
a counterpoise to the public cry." : Colonel Mason had not 
consented to serve again in the Assembly, but the honor 
was forced upon him ; and Washington, in his journal of 
April 17, 1786, speaks of going "up to Alexandria to an 
election of delegates to represent the county, Colo. Mason 
and Doctr. Stuart elected." And he adds, the "suffrages 
of the people fell upon the first contrary to, and after 
he had declared he could not serve, and on the other 
whilst he was absent at Richmond. Capt. West who 
had offered his services and was present was rejected. 
The votes were, for Col. Mason 109, for Dr. Stuart 105, 
and for Capt. West 84." 3 George Mason s health did not 
permit him to attend at this year s session of the Assembly, 
but he was present the following October. The question of 
paper money was brought up 1786-7, and was defeated ; 
its emission was denounced as " unjust, impolitic, and de 
structive of public confidence, and of that virtue which is the 
basis of republican government." 4 George Nicholas headed 
the long list of those who voted in favor of this resolution, 
and doubtless George Mason s influence was felt here, as in 
the assessment controversy, though he was not present. On

APPOINTED A DELEGATE TO PHILADELPHIA. 97 

the 4th of December, 1786, the Assembly appointed seven 
deputies to the convention in Pennsylvania, George Wash 
ington, Patrick Henry, Edmund Randolph, John Blair, 
James Madison, George Mason, and George Wythe. 1 Pat 
rick Henry declined the appointment, and James McClurg 
was nominated in his place. 

But one letter of George Mason s, written in 1786, has 
been preserved. This was addressed to " Col. John Fitz 
gerald, Merchant in Alexandria." It is on the subject of 
Colonel Mason s tobacco shipments to Bordeaux, where he 
hears of the failure of a certain house to which his consign 
ments had been sent : " I should think," he writes, " it will 
be proper for me, without loss of time, to write to some 
merchant of credit in Bordeaux, authorizing him to take 
possession of the tobacco and sell it on my account, for 
which purpose perhaps a power of attorney from me may 
be necessary in case the authority merely of a letter should 
be disputed. Mercantile transactions are so out of my line 
of life that I am really at a loss how to proceed, and shall 
be obliged to you for your advice." 2 

The year 1787 was to bring George Mason out of his 
retirement into a wider field of action than he had ever 
before entered. He had come forward at the call of his 
State to serve in the Federal Convention, a council to which 
all were now anxiously looking as the final effort to amend 
the Union. It was to meet in Philadelphia in May. Madi 
son, who was an ardent advocate of a stronger federal gov 
ernment, wrote from Congress to Jefferson on the 2$d of 
April : 

" The prospect of a full and respectable convention grows 
stronger every day. . . . Our Governor, Mr. Wythe, Mr. 
Blair, and Col. Mason will pretty certainly attend. The last, 
I am informed, is renouncing his errors on the subject of the 
confederation, and means to take an active part in the amend 
ment of it."

98 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

Colonel Mason s " errors," in the eyes of Madison, con 
sisted undoubtedly in his wholesome fears of drawing too 
tight the bonds of union. With Patrick Henry and Richard 
Henry Lee he was jealous of unnecessary encroachments on 
the sovereignty of Virginia. Edmund Randolph, then gov 
ernor, was at this time of the same party. The following 
letters were written to Edmund Randolph in reply to the 
latter, who had given Colonel Mason notice of the time 
appointed for the meeting of the convention, and informed 
him that the money to defray his expenses would be pro 
vided by the State. 

GUNSTON HALL, April i2th, 1787. 
DEAR SIR : 

I have received your favour, notifying the time appointed for 
the meeting of the deputies of the different States in the city 
of Philadelphia, and informing me that the money was ready in 
the treasury to be advanced us, for defraying our expenses ; this 
last is, at present, an article of such importance to me, that 
without it, I could hardly have attended ; having been dis 
appointed in the payment of several sums of tobacco sold ; so 
that I have lately been obliged to commence suits in Virginia 
and Maryland, for nearly the amount of six thousand pounds, 
upon contracts, in which I expected punctuality. 

I have desired the bearer, my neighbor Col. Wagener, to 
bring me up, from the treasury, the sum of sixty pounds. 
Should our stay in Philadelphia prove shorter than I expect, 
whatever money may remain, more than my due, shall be punc

ever directions may be necessary from the Executive, for remit 
ting the said sum of sixty pounds to me by Col. Wagener ; as I 
shall not probably meet with another safe hand, in time.

LETTERS TO EDMUND KANDOLPII. 99 

C.UNSTON HALL, April 23d, 1787. 
DEAR SIR : 

I have received your favor by Col. Wagener with the sum of 
sixty pounds from the treasury. I was unacquainted with the 
sum allotted for each deputy, and was afraid of exceeding it. 
Considering the number of deputies from the different States, 
the great distance of some of them, and the probability that we 
may be obliged to wait many days before a full meeting can be 
obtained, we may, perhaps, be much longer from home than I at 
first expected. I will, therefore, accept your very obliging offer 
of getting the balance of the sum of ^100 (vizt.^4o), invested 
for me in Philadelphia Bank notes, or good notes on Mr. Robert 
Morris, either of which, I presume, will be equal to cash in the 
city of Philadelphia, and you will do me the favor to bring them 
up with you. Whatever remains more than our allowance of six 
dollars per day, shall be punctually returned to the treasury. 

I think to set out time enough to spend a day or two in 
Annapolis, in order to have a little conversation with some of the 
Maryland deputies on the subject of the convention, and if 
the weather proves fine to cross the bay there ; otherwise to go 
through Baltimore. I expect to have the pleasure of seeing you 
at Gunston Hall on your way, and if you will do me the favor to 
let me know at what time to expect you, I will regulate my 
movements accordingly. I am, with the greatest regard and 
esteem, dear Sir, 

Your most obedient servant,

CHAPTER IV. 

IN THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 
May-July, 1787. 

Of the Convention which framed the Constitution of the 
United States, Flanders says : 

" Over its deliberations presided Washington ; the genial 
wisdom of Franklin illustrated its debates ; the trained mind, 
extensive information and reflective habits of Madison ; the 
fertile resources, the ready and trenchant talents of Gouverneur 
Morris ; the liberal views and sound sense of Charles Cotesworth 
Pinckney ; the inflexible integrity and unbending republicanism of 
Colonel Mason ; the penetrating mind and persuasive eloquence 
of Rufus King, were all displayed on this conspicuous theatre, 
and more or less determined the course and result of the Con 
vention." 

To this brilliant assemblage we now follow the subject of 
our memoir. Colonel Mason arrived in Philadelphia the 
1 7th of May, and two letters of his to George Mason, Jr., 
and one to Arthur Lee, bring us to the threshold of the new 
scene in which he was to act such a conspicuous part. 

" PHILADELPHIA, May 2oth, 1787. 
" DEAR GEORGE : 

" Upon our arrival here on Thursday evening, seventeenth May, 
I found only the States of Virginia and Pennsylvania fully repre 
sented ; and there are at this time only five New York, the two 
Carolinas, and the two before mentioned. All the States, Rhode

LETTER TO HIS SON GEORGE. IOI 



Island excepted, have made their appointments ; but the mem 
bers drop in slowly ; some of the deputies from the Eastern 
States are here, but none of them have yet a sufficient represen 
tation, and it will probably be several days before the Convention 
will be authorized to proceed to business. The expectations and 
hopes of all the Union centre in this Convention. God grant 
that we may be able to concert effectual means of preserving 
our country from the evils which threaten us. 

" The Virginia deputies (who are all here) meet and confer 
together two or three hours every day, in order to form a proper 
correspondence of sentiments ; and for form s sake, to see what 
new deputies are arrived, and to grow into some acquaintance 
with each other, we regularly meet every day at three o clock. 
These and some occasional conversations with the deputies of 
different States, and with some of the general officers of the late 
army (who are here upon a general meeting of the Cincinnati), ;ij 
are the only opportunities I have hitherto had of forming any * 
opinion upon the great subject of our mission, and, consequently, I 
a very imperfect and indecisive one. Yet, upon the great princi-i 
pies of it, I have reason to hope there will be greater unanimity 
and less opposition, except from the little States, than was at first 
apprehended. The most prevalent idea in the principal States 
seems to be a total alteration of the present federal system, and 
substituting a great national council or parliament, consisting of 
two branches of the legislature, founded upon the principles of 
equal proportionate representation, with full legislative powers 
upon all the subjects of the Union ; and a&. executive : and to 
make the several State legislatures subordinate to the national, 
by giving the latter the power of a negative upon all such laws 
as they shall judge contrary to the interest of the federal Union. 
It is easy to foresee that there will be much difficulty in organizing 
a government upon this great scale, and at the same time reserv 
ing to the State legislatures a sufficient portion of power for 
promoting and securing the prosperity and happiness of their 
respective citizens ; yet with a proper degree of coolness, liberal 
ity and candor (very rare commodities by the bye), I doubt not 
but it may be effected. There are among a variety some very f 
eccentric opinions upon this great subject ; and what is a very | 
extraordinary phenomenon, we are likely to find the republicans, f

on this occasion, issue from the Southern and Middle States, and 
the anti-republicans from the Eastern ; however extraordinary 
this may at first seem, it may, I think be accounted for from a 
very common and natural impulse of the human mind. Men 
disappointed in expectations too hastily and sanguinely formed^ 
tired and disgusted with the unexpected evils they have experi 
enced, and anxious to remove them as far as possible, are very 
apt to run into the opposite extreme ; and the people of the 
Eastern States, setting out with more republican principles, have 
consequently been more disappointed than we have been. 

" We found travelling very expensive from eight to nine 
dollars per day. In this city the living is cheap. We are at the 
old Indian Queen in Fourth Street, where we are very well accom 
modated, have a good room to ourselves, and are charged only 
twenty-five Pennsylvania currency per day, including our servants 
and horses, exclusive of club in liquors and extra charges ; so 
that I hope I shall be able to defray my expenses with my public 
allowance, and more than that I do not wish." 

PHILADELPHIA, May 21, 1787. 
DEAR SIR : 

I take the opportunity by Col. Carrington of returning the 
papers you left in my hands, when I had the pleasure of your 
company at Gunston Hall. 

I arrived in this city on Thursday evening last, but found so 
few of the deputies here from the several States that I am unable 
to form any certain opinion on the subject of our mission. The 
most prevalent idea I think at present is a total change of the 
federal system, and instituting a great national council or parlia 
ment upon the principles of equal, proportionate representation, 
consisting of two branches of the legislature invested with full 
legislative powers upon the objects of the Union ; and to make 
the State legislatures subordinate to the national by giving to the 
latter a negative upon all such laws as they judge contrary to the 
principles and interest of the Union ; to establish also a national 
executive, and a judiciary system with cognizance of all such mat 
ters as depend upon the law of nations, and such other objects as 
the local courts of justice may be inadequate to.

LETTER TO ARTHUR LEE. 1 03 



I shall do myself the honor of corresponding with you from 
time to time, and shall be much obliged to you for your senti 
ments upon the important subjects that will be agitated in this 
Convention, upon which the prosperity and the safety of our 
country will so materially depend. 

I have received your favor by Major Jackson ; nothing that I 
have heard has yet been mentioned upon this subject among the 
deputies now here ; though I understand there are several candi 
dates, which I am surprised at, as the office will be of so short 
duration, and merely honorary, or possibly introductory to some 
thing more substantial. 

I am with the greatest esteem and regard

PHILADELPHIA, May 27, 1787. 
DEAR GEORGE : 

T wrote you by the post a few days after my arrival in this 
city. I shall be glad to know whether my letter has come safe 
to hand, as also the letters I wrote from Baltimore to your 
brothers William and Thomson, to which I have not yet received 
any answer. I wish to be informed also whether you have had 
any good rains and what prospect of the crops of wheat and 
tobacco. It is impossible to judge how long we shall be de 
tained here, but from present appearances I fear until July, if 
not later. I begin to grow heartily tired of the etiquette and 
nonsense so fashionable in this city. It would take me some 
months to make myself master of them, and that it should 
require months to learn what is not worth remembering as many 
minutes, is to me so discouraging a circumstance as determines 
me to give myself no manner of trouble about them. I have not 
yet been able to do anything respecting your brother John, and 
fear I shall meet with much difficulty on that subject.

104 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

We had yesterday, for the first time, a representation of seven 
States New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Vir- 
ginia, and the two Carolinas, and it is expected that the deputies 
from Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Georgia will be here by 
Monday or Tuesday. The State of Rhode Island has refused 
to appoint deputies, and although New Hampshire has appointed 
it is thought we shall be deprived of their representation by no 
provision having been made for defraying their expenses. The 
State of Delaware has tied up the hands of her deputies by an 
express direction to retain the principle in the present Con 
federation of each State having the same vote ; no other State, 
so far as we have yet seen, hath restrained its deputies on any 
subject. 

Nothing was done yesterday but unanimously appointing 
General Washington President ; Major Jackson (by a majority of 
five States to two) Secretary ; reading the credentials from the 
different States on the floor, and appointing a committee to draw 
up and report the rules of proceeding. It is expected our doors 
will be shut, and communications upon the business of the Con 
vention be forbidden during its sitting. This I think myself a 
proper precaution to prevent mistakes and misrepresentation 
until the business shall have been completed, when the whole 
may have a very different complexion from that in which the 
several crude and indigested parts might in their first shape 
appear if submitted to the public eye. 

Present me kindly to Betsy, to the family at Gunston, to Mr. 
McCarty and Sallie, and to all our friends. 
I am, dear George, 

Your affectionate father,

Richard Henry Lee had declined a seat in the Conven

convictions should determine. He wrote to George Mason, 
giving his views in regard to the changes to be desired, 
knowing that Colonel Mason would be likely to forward 
them.

RICHARD HENRY LEE TO GEORGE MASON. 105 



May 15, 1787, CHANTILLY. 

DEAR SIR It has given me much pleasure to be informed that 
General Washington and yourself have gone to the Convention. 
We may hope, from such efforts, that alterations beneficial will 
take place in our Federal Constitution, if it shall be found, on 
deliberate inquiry, that the evils now felt do flow from errors in 
that constitution ; but, alas ! sir, I fear it is more in vicious 
manners, than mistakes in form, that we must seek for the 
causes of the present discontent. The present causes of com 
plaint seem to be, that Congress cannot command the money 
necessary for the just purposes of paying debts, or for support 
ing the federal government ; and that they cannot make treaties 
of commerce, unless power unlimited, of regulating trade be 
given. The Confederation now gives right to name the sums 
necessary, and to apportion the quotas by a rule established. 
This rule is, unfortunately, very difficult of execution, and, 
therefore, the recommendations of Congress on this subject 
have not been made in federal mode ; so that States have 
thought themselves justified in non-compliance. If the rule 
were plain and easy, and refusal were then to follow demand, I 
see clearly, that no form of government whatever, short of force, 
will answer ; for the same want of principle that produces 
neglect now, will do so under any change not supported by power 
compulsory ; the difficulty certainly is, how to give this power in 
such manner as that it may only be used to good, and not abused 
to bad, purposes. Whoever shall solve this difficulty will receive 
the thanks of this and future generations. With respect to the 
want of power to make treaties of trade, for want of legislation, 
to regulate the general commerce, it appears to me, that the 
right of making treaties, and the legislative power contended for 
are essentially different things ; the former may be given and 
executed, without the danger attending upon the States parting 
with their legislative authority, in the instance contended for. 
If the third paragraph of the sixth article were altered, by 
striking out the words, in pursuance of any treaties already pro 
posed by Congress, to the courts of France and Spain ; and the 
proviso stricken out of the first section in the ninth article, Con 
gress would then have a complete and unlimited right of making 
treaties of all kinds, and, so far, I really think it both right and 



106 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MA SO IV. 



necessary ; but this is very different from, and in danger far 
short of, giving an exclusive power of regulating trade. A min 
ister of Congress may go to a foreign court with full power to 
make a commercial treaty ; but if he were to propose to such 
court that the eight northern States in this Union, should have 
the exclusive right of carrying the products of the five southern 
States, or of supplying these States with foreign articles, such a 
proposition of monopoly would be rejected ; and, therefore, no 
danger here from the power of making treaty ; but a legislative 
right to regulate trade through the States may, in a thousand 
artful modes, be so abused as to produce the monopoly aforesaid, 
to the extreme oppression of the staple States, as they are called. 
I do not say that this would be done, but I contend that it 
might be done ; and, where interest powerfully prompts, it is 
greatly to be feared that it would be done. Whoever has served 
long in Congress, knows that the restraint of making the consent 
of nine States necessary, is feeble and incompetent. Some will 
sometimes sleep, and some will be negligent, but it is certain that 
improper power not given cannot be improperly used. 

The human mind is too apt to rush from one extreme to 
another ; it appears, by the objections that came from the differ 
ent States, when the Confederation was submitted for considera 
tion, that the universal apprehension was, of the too great, not 
the defective powers of Congress. Whence this immense change 
of sentiment, in a few years ? for now the cry is power, give Con 
gress power. Without reflecting that every free nation, that hath 
ever existed, has lost its liberty by the same rash impatience, and 
want of necessary caution. I am glad, however, to find, on this 
occasion, that so many gentlemen, of competent years, are sent 
to the Convention, for, certainly, " youth is the season of credu 
lity, and confidence a plant of slow growth in an aged bosom." 
The States have been so unpardonably remiss, in furnishing their 
federal quotas, as to make impost necessary, for a term of time, 
with a provisional security, that the money arising shall be un 
changeably applied to the payment of their public debts ; that 
accounts of the application, shall be annually sent to each State ; 
and the collecting officers appointed by, and be amenable to the 
States : or, if not so, very strong preventives and correctives of 
official abuse and misconduct, interpose, to shield the people from 



SUGGESTIONS FOR THE NEW SYSTEM. IO/ 

oppression. Give me leave, sir, to detain you a moment longer, 
with a proposition that I have not heard mentioned. It is that 
the right of making paper money shall be exclusively vested in 
Congress ; such a right will be clearly within the spirit of the 
fourth section of the ninth article of the present confederation. 
This appears to me, to be a restraint of the last importance to the 
peace and happiness of the Union, and of every part of it. 
Knaves assure, and fools believe, that calling paper money, and 
making it tender, is the way to be rich and happy ; thus the 
national mind is kept in constant ferment ; and the public coun 
cils in continual disturbance by the intrigues of wicked men, for 
fraudulent purposes, for speculating designs. This would be a 
great step towards correcting morals, and suppressing legislative 
frauds, which, of all frauds, is the most hateful to society. Do 
you not think, sir, that it ought to be declared, by the new system, 
that any State act of legislation that shall contravene, or oppose, 
the authorized acts of Congress, or interfere with the expressed 
rights of that body, shall be ip so facto void, and of no force what 
soever ? 

My respects, if you please, to your brethren of the Convention, 
from this State, and pardon me for the liberty I have taken of 
troubling you with my sentiments on the interesting business that 
calls you to Philadelphia. I have the honour to be, with affec 
tionate esteem and regard, 

Your friend and servant, 

RICHARD HENRV LEE. 

George Mason, Esq. 1 

The Convention met on Friday, the 25th of May, seven 
States being represented. On the following Monday nine 
other deputies took their seats, and Connecticut and Mary 
land were added to the number of States present. The rules 
as reported were read. Mr. King of Massachusetts objected 
to that one authorizing any member to call for the yeas and 
nays and have them entered on the minutes. Colonel Mason 
seconded the objection, adding " that such a record of the 
opinions of members would be an obstacle to a change of 

1 " Life of Richard II. Lee," vol. ii., p. 71. 



IOS LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEOKGE MASON. 



them on conviction ; and in case of its being hereafter pro 
mulgated must furnish handles to the adversaries of the 

o 

result of the meeting." The rule was then rejected. Madi 
son tells us in his report of these debates that previous to 
the opening of the Convention it had been a subject of dis 
cussion among the members present, as to how the States 
should vote in the Convention. Several of the members 
from Pennsylvania had urged that the large States unite in 
refusing to the small States an equal vote, but Virginia, be 
lieving this to be injudicious if not unjust "discountenanced 
and stifled the project." On the 2Qth the real business of 
the Convention was opened by Edmund Randolph, who as 
Governor of Virginia was put forward as spokesman by his 
colleagues. He began by saying that as the Convention had 
originated from Virginia, and the delegation from this State 
supposed that some proposition was expected from them, 
the task had been imposed on him. After enumerating the 
defects of the Confederation, he detailed the remedy pro 
posed. This latter was set forth in fifteen resolutions and 
was called afterwards the Virginia plan of government. 
Charles Pinckney from South Carolina had also a draft of a 
federal government, which was read and like the former re 
ferred to a committee of the whole House. 

The first proposition debated was a resolution presented 
by Edmund Randolph but formulated by Gouverneur Mor 
ris, " That a national government ought to be established 
consisting of a Supreme Legislative, Executive, and Judici 
ary." Here South Carolina asked if Mr. Randolph meant to 
abolish the State governments. Doubts were expressed by 
members from Massachusetts and South Carolina whether 
the deputies could discuss a system founded on different 
principles from the Federal Constitution. Gouverneur Mor 
ris explained the difference, as he conceived it, between a 
federal and a national government. The term federal, how 
ever, was to change its signification, and to be used by the 
advocates of a " national government " to describe themselves. 

" Madison Papers," vol. ii., p. 724. 



DELINQUENT STATES COULD NOT BE COERCED. 109 

George Mason spoke after Mr. Morris, and put his finger on 
one of the chief weaknesses of the existing system. He ob 
served, " not only that the present Confederation was defi 
cient in not providing for coercion and punishment against 
delinquent States, but argued very cogently that punishment 
could not in the nature of things be executed on the States 
collectively, and therefore that such a government was neces 
sary as could directly operate on individuals, and would 
punish those only whose guilt required it." This was a 
cardinal principle, that coercion could not be used against 
States. And here George Mason was in direct opposition to 
a clause in the sixth resolution of the Virginia plan, as pre 
sented by Edmund Randolph, which declared that the 
National or Federal legislature should have the power "to 
call forth the force of the Union against any member of the 
Union failing to fulfil its duty under the Articles thereof." 
Of all the Virginia delegation, apparently, Washington, 
Madison, Randolph, McClurg, and Mason, the latter alone 
saw clearly the danger here, and he was the first one in the 
Convention to suggest the solution of the difficulty which 
was subsequently adopted. 

On the 3 1st of May Georgia was represented in the Con 
vention, making ten States present. It was agreed without 
debate on this day that the " National Legislature " ought 
to consist of two branches, but the succeeding resolution, 
that the members of the first branch ought to be elected by 
the people of the several States, provoked some discussion. 
It was opposed, says Yates, " strange to tell by Massachu 
setts and Connecticut, who supposed they ought to be 
chosen by the legislatures ; and Virginia supported the re 
solve, alleging that this ought to be the democratic branch of 
government, and as such immediately vested in the people." 2 
Colonel Mason spoke first after Sherman and Gerry, and 
Madison followed after Wilson, of Pennsylvania, all three of 
the latter contending for an election of the larger branch of 

1 ibid., p. 748. 

- Yates Minutes, Elliot s " Debates," second edition, 1861, vol. i., p. 392. 



I1O LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



Congress by the people. " It was to be," said George 
Mason, " the grand depository of the democratic principle 
of the government. It was, so to speak, to be our House 
of Commons. It ought to know and sympathize with every 
part of the community ; and ought therefore to be taken, 
not only from different parts of the whole republic, but also 
from different districts of the larger members of it ; which 
had in several instances, particularly in Virginia, different 
interests and views arising from difference of produce, of 
habits, etc. He admitted that we had been too demo 
cratic, but was afraid we should incautiously run into the 
opposite extreme. We ought to attend to the rights of 
every class of the people. He had often wondered at the 
indifference of the superior classes of society to this dictate 
of humanity and policy ; considering, that, however afflu 
ent their circumstances, or elevated their situations, might 
be, the course of a few years not only might, but certainly 
would, distribute their posterity throughout the lowest 
classes of society. Every selfish motive, therefore, every 
family attachment, ought to recommend such a system of 
policy as would provide no less carefully for the rights 
and happiness of the lowest, than of the highest, order of 
citizens. 

On the ist of June the Convention considered the ques 
tion of the Executive. It was moved that his term of office 
should be for seven years, though others advocated three 
years, providing for re-eligibility. George Mason " was for 
seven years at least, and for prohibiting a re-eligibility, as the 
best expedient, both for preventing the effect of a false 
complaisance on the side of the Legislature towards unfit 
characters ; and a temptation on the side of the Executive to 
intrigue with the Legislature for a re-appointment." And 
seven years was the term then agreed upon. On the mode of 
appointing the Executive, whether it should be by Congress, 
as proposed in the Virginia plan, or by the people, as was 
moved at this time, there was some debate. George Mason 

1 " Madison Papers," vol. ii., p. 754. 2 Ibid., p. 766. 



OBJECTIONS TO A SINGLE EXECUTIVE. Ill 



advocated the latter mode " but thought it impracticable. 
He wished, however, that Mr. Wilson, who had suggested 
the election by the people might have time to digest it in 
his own form." On the following day the subject was 
renewed, but the plan of Presidential Electors was not agreed 
to. In regard to a resolution " that the Executive be made 
removable by the National Legislature," George Mason said : 
" Some mode of displacing an unfit magistrate is rendered 
indispensable by the fallibility of those who choose, as well 
as by the corruptibility of the man chosen. He opposed 
decidedly the making the Executive the mere creature of 
the Legislature, as a violation of the fundamental principles 
of good government." : 

The vote on the question of a single Executive was taken 
on Monday, the 4th of June. Colonel Mason happened 
not to be in the House at the time, but he was known to be 
opposed to the resolve. Later in the day he spoke against 
vesting the executive powers in a single person. Among 
these powers, he went on to say, was that of appointing to 
offices in certain cases. 

" The probable abuses of a negative had been well explained 
by Dr. Franklin, as proved by experience, the best of all tests. 
Will not the same door be opened here ? The Executive may 
refuse its assent to necessary measures, till new appointments 
shall be referred to him ; and having by degrees engrossed 
all these into his own hands, the American Executive, like the 
British, will, by bribery and influence, save himself the trouble 
and odium of exerting his negative afterwards. We are, Mr. 
Chairman, going very far in this business. We are not, indeed, 
constituting a British government, but a more dangerous mon 
archy, an elective one. We are introducing a new principle into 
our system, and not necessary, as in the British government, 
where the executive has greater rights to defend. Do gentlemen 
mean to pave the way to hereditary monarchy ? Do they flatter 
themselves that the people will ever consent to such an inno 
vation ? If they do, I venture to tell them, they are mistaken. 
1 Ibid., p. 768. IMd., p. 776. 



112 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

The people never will consent. And do gentlemen consider the 
danger of delay, and the still greater danger of a rejection, not 
for a moment, but forever, of the plan which shall be proposed to 
them ? Notwithstanding the oppression and injustice experi 
enced among us from democracy, the genius of the people is in 
favor of it ; and the genius of the people must be consulted. He 
could not but consider the Federal system as in effect dissolved 
by the appointment of this convention to devise a better one. 
And do gentlemen look forward to the dangerous interval 
between extinction of an old, and the establishment of a new, 
government ; and to the scenes of confusion which may ensue ? 
He hoped that nothing like a monarchy would ever be attempted 
in this country. A hatred to its oppressions had carried the 
people through the late Revolution. Will it not be enough 
to enable the Executive to suspend offensive laws, till they shall 
be coolly revised, and the objections to them overruled by a 
greater majority than was required in the first instance ? He 
never could agree to give up all the rights of the people to 
a single magistrate. If more than one had been fixed on, 
greater powers might have been entrusted to the Executive. 
He hoped this attempt to give such powers would have its 
weight hereafter, as an argument for increasing the number of 
the executive." l 

George Mason s views on the subject of the Executive are 
further elaborated in the following speech, which is pre 
served in manuscript, and which is undated, but was evi 
dently written for delivery in the Convention at this or a 
subsequent period. 

" It is not yet determined how the Executive is to be regulated, 
whether it is to act solely from its own judgment, or with 
the advice of others ; whether there is, or is not to be a council 
annexed to it, and if a council how far their advice shall operate 
in controlling the judgment of the supreme magistracy. If there 
is no Council of State and the executive power be vested in 
a single person, what are the provisions for its proper operation, 

1 Ibid., p. 787. 



SPEECH ON THIS QUESTION. 113 

upon casual disability by sickness or otherwise. These are sub 
jects which must come under our consideration, and perhaps 
some of the most important objections would, be obviated by 
placing the executive power in the hands of three, instead of one 
person. 

" There is also to be a council of revision, invested, in a great 
measure, with a power of negative upon the laws ; and an idea 
has been suggested, either within or without doors, that this 
council should be formed of the principal officers of the state, 
I presume of the members of the Treasury Board, the^Board of 
War, the Navy Board, and the Department for Foreign Affairs. 
It is unnecessary, if not improper, to examine this part of the 
subject now, but I will venture to hazard an opinion, when 
it comes to be thoroughly investigated, that we can hardly find 
worse materials out of which to create a council of revision, 
or more improper or unsafe hands in which to place the power 
of a negative upon our laws. It is proposed, I think, sir, in the 
plan upon your table, that this council of revision shall be 
formed out of the members of the Judiciary departments joined 
with the Executive; and I am inclined to think, when the subject 
shall be taken up, it may be demonstrated, that this will be the 
wisest and safest mode of constituting this important council of 
revision. But the federal inferior courts of justice must, I pre 
sume, be fixed in the several respective States, and consequently 
most of them at a great distance from the seat of the federal 
government. The almost continual operation of the council 
of revision upon the acts of the national parliament, and upon 
their negative of the acts of the several State legislatures, will 
require that this council should be easily and speedily convened, 
and consequently, that only the judges of the Supreme Federal 
Court, fixed near the seat of government, can be members of it. 
Their number will be small. By placing the Executive in three 
persons, instead of one, we shaft not only increase the number of 
the council of revision (which I have endeavored to show will 
want increasing), but by giving to each of the three a vote in the 
council of revision, we shall increase the strength of the Execu 
tive in that particular circumstance in which it will most want 
strength in the power of defending itself against the encroach 
ments of the legislature. These, I must acknowledge, are, with

me, weighty considerations for vesting the Executive rather in 
three than in one person. 

" The chief advantages which have been urged in favor of unity 
in the Executive, are the secresy, the dispatch, the vigor and 
energy which the government will derive from it, especially in 
time of war. That these are great advantages, I shall most 
readily allow. They have been strongly insisted on by all 
monarchical writers ; they have been acknowledged by the ablest 
and most candid defenders of republican government ; and it 
cannot be denied that a monarchy possesses them in a much 
greater degree than a republic. Yet perhaps a little reflection 
may incline us to doubt whether these advantages are not greater 
in theory than in practice, or lead us to enquire whether there is 
not some pervading principle in republican government which 
sets at naught and tramples upon this boasted superiority, as 
hath been experienced to their cost, by most monarchies which 
have been imprudent enough to invade or attack their republi 
can neighbors. This invincible principle is to be found in the 
love, the affection, the attachment of the citizens to their laws, 
to their freedom, and to their country. Every husbandman will 
be quickly converted into a soldier when he knows and feels 
that he is to fight not in defence of the rights of a particular 
family, or, a prince, but for his own. This is the true construc 
tion of the/rtf arts et focis which has, in all ages, performed such 
wonders. It was this which in ancient times enabled the little 
cluster of Grecian republics to resist, and almost constantly to 
defeat, the Persian monarch. It was this which supported the 
States of Holland against a body of veteran troops through a 
thirty years war with Spain, then the greatest monarchy in 
Europe, and finally rendered them victorious. It is this which 
preserves the freedom and independence of the Swiss Cantons in 
the midst of the most powerful nations. And who that reflects 
seriously upon the situation of America, in the beginning of the 
late war without arms without soldiers without trade, money 
or credit, in a manner destitute of all resources, but must ascribe 
our success to this pervading, all-powerful principle ? 

" We have not yet been able to define the powers of the Execu 
tive, and however moderately some gentlemen may talk or think 
upon the subject, I believe there is a general tendency to a strong 



EXECUTIVE CONSISTING OF THREE PERSONS. I I 

Executive, and I am inclined to think a strong Executive necessary. 
If strong and extensive powers are vested in the Executive, and 
that executive consists only of one person, the government will 
of course degenerate (for I will call it degeneracy) into a mon 
archy a government so contrary to the genius of the people 
that they will reject even the appearance of it. I consider the 
federal government as in some measure dissolved by the meeting 
of this Convention. Are there no dangers to be apprehended 
from procrastinating the time between the breaking up of this 
Assembly and the adoption of a new system of government ? I 
dread the interval. If it should not be brought to an issue in 
the course of the first year the consequences may be fatal. Have 
not the different parts of this extensive government, the several 
States of which it is composed a right to expect an equal partici 
pation in the Executive, as the best means of securing an equal 
attention to their interests ? Should an insurrection, a rebellion 
or invasion happen in New Hampshire when the single supreme 
magistrate is a citizen of Georgia, would not the people of New 
Hampshire naturally ascribe any delay in defending them to such 
a circumstance and vice versa ? If the Executive is vested in 
three persons, one chosen from the Northern, one from the 
Middle, and one from the Southern States, will it not contribute 
to quiet the minds of the people and convince them that there 
will be proper attention paid to their respective concerns ? Will 
not three men so chosen bring with them, into office, a more per 
fect and extensive knowledge of the real interests of this great 
Union ? Will not such a mode of appointment be the most 
effectual means of preventing cabals and intrigues between the 
legislature and the candidates for this office, especially with 
those candidates who from their local situation, near the seat of 
the federal government, will have the greatest temptations and 
the greatest opportunities ? Will it not be the most effectual 
means of checking and counteracting the aspiring views of 
dangerous and ambitious men, and consequently the best secur 
ity for the stability and duration of our government upon the 
invaluable principles of liberty ? These Sir, are some of my 
motives for preferring an Executive consisting of three persons 
rather than of one." J

Il6 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

Edmund Randolph advocated in the Convention this sug 
gestion of his colleague, that the Executive should consist 
of three members, taken from the three sections of the 
country. 

On Wednesday, June 6th, the important question was 
debated as to the election of the first branch of the legis 
lature. Should it be by the State legislatures or by the 
people ? The latter method, embraced in the Virginia plan, 
was now advocated by both Madison and Mason. " Under 
the existing Confederacy," said George Mason, " Congress 
represent the States and not the people of the States ; their 
acts operate on the States, not on the individuals. The case 
will be changed in the new plan of government. The people 
will be represented ; they ought therefore to choose the 
Representatives. The requisites in actual representation 
are, that the Representatives should sympathize with their 
constituents ; should think as they think, and feel as they 
feel ; and that for these purposes they should be residents 
among them. Much, he said, had been alleged against 
democratic elections. He admitted that much might be 
said ; but it was to be considered that no government was 
free from imperfections and evils ; and that improper elec 
tions in many instances were inseparable from republican 
governments. But compare these with the advantage of 
this form, in favor of the rights of the people, in favor 
of human nature ! He was persuaded there was a better 
chance for proper elections by the people, if divided into 
large districts, than by the State Legislatures. Paper-money 
had been issued by the latter, when the former were against 
it. Was it to be supposed that the State Legislatures, then, 
would not send to the National Legislature patrons of such 
projects, if the choice depended on them." The Conven 
tion recurring again to the Executive, the resolution to 
give the latter power, with the assistance of some of the 
judiciary, to revise the laws passed by the legislature, was 
reconsidered, and Colonel Mason was for " giving all possi-

ble weight to the revisionary institution. The executive 
power," he thought, " ought to be well secured against 
legislative usurpations on it. The purse and the sword 
ought never to get into the same hands, whether legislative 
or executive." 

On the following day another great point in the forma 
tion of the Constitution was debated. The motion was 
made by Mr. Dickinson for the appointment of the Senate 
by the State legislatures, and carried in the affirmative. 
George Mason was the last one to speak on this occasion. 
" Whatever power," he said, " may be necessary for the 
national government, a certain portion must necessarily be 
left with the States. It is impossible for one power to 
pervade the extreme parts of the United States, so as to 
carry equal justice to them. The State Legislatures also 
ought to have some means of defending themselves against 
encroachments of the national government. In every other 
department we have studiously endeavoured to provide for 
its self-defence. Shall we leave the States alone unprovided 
w r ith the means for this purpose ? And what better means 
can we provide, than the giving them some share in, or 
rather to make them a constituent part of, the national 
establishment ? There is danger on both sides, no doubt ; 
but we have only seen the evils arising on the side of the 
State governments. Those on the other side remain to be 
displayed. The example of Congress does not apply. 
Congress had no power to carry their acts into execution, as 
the national government will have." 2 The thirteenth resolu 
tion of the Virginia plan, providing for making amendments 
to the Constitution without the assent of the legislature of 
the Union, came up for consideration on the nth, and 
Colonel Mason urged the necessity of such a provision : 

" The plan now to be formed will certainly be defective, as the 
Confederation has been found on trial to be. Amendments, there 
fore, will be necessary ; and it will be better to provide for them

IlS LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

in an easy, regular and constitutional way, than to trust to chance 
and violence. It would be improper to require the consent of 
the national legislature, because they may abuse their power, 
and refuse their assent on that very account. The opportunity 
for such an abuse may be the fault of the Constitution calling 
for amendment." l 

George Mason seconded a motion made by Madison the 
following day, relating to the payment of members of the 
federal legislature. He thought " that it would be improper 
to leave the wages to be regulated by the States, first the 
different States would make different provision for their 
representatives, and an inequality would be felt among them, 
whereas he thought they ought to be in all respects equal ; 
secondly, the parsimony of the States might reduce the 
provision so low, that, as had already happened in choosing 
delegates to Congress, the question would be, not who were 
most fit to be chosen, but who were most willing to serve." 
The qualification for the age of Senators was fixed at thirty. 
Amono; George Mason s memoranda of the Convention are 

fc&gt; o 

this note and resolve, showing his agency in an important 
part of the Convention s work : 

" G. Mason begs the favor of Maj. Jackson to correct the 
following Resolution, in the manner it hath been agreed to by 
the Convention. 

" 4. Resolved, That the members of the second branch of the 
legislature of the United States ought to be chosen by the indi 
vidual legislatures, to be of the age of thirty years at least, to 
hold their offices for the term of six years, one third to go out 
biennially ; to be ineligible to and incapable of holding any office 
under the authority of the United States, except those peculiarly 
belonging to the functions of the second branch, during the 
term for which they were chosen and for one year thereafter." 3 

The Committee of the Whole had debated from day to 
day the resolutions contained in the Virginia plan, and on 

1 Ibid., p. 844. - Ibid., p. 849. 3 Mason Papers. 



VIRGINIA AND NEW JERSEY PLANS COMPARED. 119 

the 1 3th of June they reported nineteen resolutions based 
upon those of Virginia, forming a system of government in 
outline. On the following day Mr. Paterson, of New Jersey, 
asked for time to prepare another plan founded on the Ar 
ticles of Confederation. This was submitted to the Conven 
tion on the 1 5th. The Virginia and the New Jersey plan 
were contrasted briefly by one of the members : 

Virginia plan proposes two branches in the legislature. 
Jersey, a single legislative body. 

Virginia, the legislative powers derived from the people. 
Jersey, from the States. 
Virginia, a single executive. 
Jersey, more than one. 

Virginia, a majority of the legislature can act. 
Jersey, a small majority can control. 

Virginia, the legislature can legislate on all national concerns. 
Jersey, only on limited objects. 
Virginia, legislature to negative all State laws. 
Jersey, giving power to the executive to compel obedience 
by force. 

Virginia, to remove the executive by impeachment. 
Jersey, on application of a majority of the States. 
Virginia, for the establishment of inferior judiciary tribunals. 
Jersey, no provision. 1 

Neither of these plans commended themselves to men like 
Hamilton, who wanted a strong government, and were 
afraid of democracy or giving power to the people. He 
thought the Virginia plan " but pork still with a little change 
of the sauce." The Articles of Confederation amended, as 
in the New Jersey plan, set forth a government approved of 
by the opposite wing of the Convention, consisting of men 
like Lansing, who professed an ultra devotion to the rights 
and autonomy of the States, yet strangely enough were 
ready to admit the use of force against them by the general 
government. George Mason, more consistent both as a

120 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

champion of State sovereignty and a believer in the rights 
of the people, sought to give each idea its practical exposi 
tion in the new government. In a debate, June 2Oth, on 
giving two branches to the legislature, Colonel Mason 
summed up the arguments in its favor, replying to those 
who opposed it. Paterson s propositions had been re 
jected by the committee the day before, and the nineteen 
resolutions based on the Virginia plan were again reported. 
The second resolution referred to the constitution of the 
legislature. 

" He did not expect this point would have been reagitated. 
The essential differences between the two plans had been clearly 
stated. The principal objections against that of Mr. Randolph 
were, the want of power, and the want of practicability. There 
can be no weight in the first, as the fiat is not to be here, but in the 
people. [The power in the Convention to frame an entirely new 
Constitution is meant here.] He thought with his colleague (Mr. 
Randolph) that there were, besides, certain crises, in which all 
the ordinary cautions yielded to public necessity. He gave as 
an example, the eventual treaty with Great Britain, in forming 
which the Commissioners of the United States had boldly disre 
garded the improvident shackles of Congress ; had given to their 
country an honorable and happy peace, and instead of being 
censured for the transgression of their powers had raised to 
themselves a monument more durable than brass. The imprac 
ticability of gaining the public concurrence, he thought, was still 
more "groundless. Mr. Lansing had cited the attempts of Con 
gress to gain an enlargement of their powers, and had inferred, 
from the miscarriage of these attempts, the hopelessness of the 
plan which he (Mr. Lansing) opposed. He thought a very dif 
ferent inference ought to have been drawn, viz., that the plan 
which Mr. Lansing espoused, and which proposed to augment 
the powers of Congress, never could be expected to succeed. He 
meant not to throw any reflections on Congress as a body, much 
less on any particular members of it. He meant, however, to 
speak his sentiments without reserve on this subject ; it was a 
privilege of age, and perhaps the only compensation which nature 
had given for the privation of so many other enjoyments ; and 



TWO BRANCHES IN THE LEGISLATURE. 121 

he should not scruple to exercise it freely. Is it to be thought 
that the people of America, so watchful over their interests, so 
jealous of their liberties, will give up their all, will surrender 
both the sword and the purse, to the same body, and that, too, 
not chosen immediately by themselves ? They never will. They 
never ought. Will they trust such a body with the regulation of 
their trade, with the regulation of their taxes, with all the other 
great powers which are in contemplation ? Will they give un 
bounded confidence to a secret journal, to the intrigues, to the 
factions, which in the nature of things appertain to such an. 
assembly ? If any man doubts the existence of these characters 
of Congress, let him consult their Journals for the years seventy- 
eight, seventy-nine, and eighty. It will be said, that if the people 
are averse to parting with power, why is it hoped that they will 
part with it to a national legislature ? The proper answer is, 
that in this case they do not part with power ; they only transfer 
it from one set of immediate representatives to another set. 
Much has been said of the unsettled state of the mind of the 
people. He believed the mind of the people of America, as 
elsewhere, was unsettled as to some points, but settled as to 
others. In two points he was sure it was well settled, first, in 
an attachment to republican government ; secondly, in an attach 
ment to more than one branch in the legislature. Their consti 
tutions accord so generally in both these circumstances, that 
they seem almost to have been preconcerted. This must either 
have been a miracle, or have resulted from the genius of the 
people. The only exceptions to the establishment of two branches 
in the legislature are the State of Pennsylvania and Congress ; 
and the latter the only single one not chosen by the people them 
selves. What has been the consequence ? The people have been 
constantly averse to giving that body further powers. 

** It was acknowledged by Mr. Paterson that his plan could not 
be enforced without military coercion. Does he consider the 
force of this concession ? The most jarring elements of nature, 
fire and water themselves, are not more incompatible than such a 
mixture of civil liberty and military execution. Will the militia 
march from one State into another, in order to collect the arrears 
of taxes from the delinquent members of the republic ? Will 
they maintain an army for this purpose ? Will not the citizens of 



122 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

the invaded State assist one another, till they rise as one man and 
shake off the Union altogether ? Rebellion is the only case in 
which the military force of the State can be properly exerted 
against its citizens. In one point of view, he was struck with 
horror at the prospect of recurring to this expedient. To punish 
the non-payment of taxes with death was a severity not yet 
adopted by despotism itself ; yet this unexampled cruelty would 
be mercy compared to a military collection of revenue in which the 
bayonet could make no discrimination between the innocent and 
the guilty. He took this occasion to repeat, that, notwithstand 
ing his solicitude to establish a national government, he never 
would agree to abolish the State governments, or render them ab 
solutely insignificant. They were as necessary as the general gov 
ernment, and he would be equally careful to preserve them. He 
was aware of the difficulty of drawing the line between them, but 
hoped it was not insurmountable. The Convention, though com 
prising so many distinguished characters, could not be expected 
to make a faultless government. And he would prefer trusting 
to posterity the amendment of its defects, rather than to push the 
experiment too far." 

Judge Yates, who gives his abstract of the debates in the 
first person always, has reported this speech of George 
Mason s a little differently, and of course, as he only pro 
fessed to give minutes, much more briefly: 

" These measures are supported by one who, at his time 
of life, has little to hope or expect from any government. 
. . . What ! would you use military force to compel the 
observance of a social compact ? It is destructive to the rights 
of the people. Do you expect the militia will do it ? or do 
you mean a standing army ? The first will never on such an oc 
casion, exert any power ; and the latter may turn its arms against 
the government which employs them. I never will consent to 
destroy State governments, and will ever be as careful to preserve 
the one as the other. . . . That the one government will be 
productive of disputes and jealousies against the other, I believe ; 
but it will produce mutual safety. I shall close with observing, 
" Madison Papers," vol., ii., p. 912. 



REPRESENTATIVES ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE. 12$ 



that though some have expressed much warmth on this and 
former occasions, I can excuse it, as the result of sudden passion ; 
and hope that although we may differ in some particular points, 
if we mean the good of the whole, our good sense, upon re 
flection, will prevent us from spreading our discontent farther." 

The Convention did not go again into committee of the 
whole, but continued to debate the nineteen resolutions 
from the iQth of June until the 23d of July. Some of 
these were referred to grand committees, consisting of one 
member from each State, or they were referred to select 
committees consisting of five members. On the question 
of the election of the first branch of the legislature, it was 
moved that it should be as each State legislature directed, 
v/hen Colonel Mason was again on his feet : 

" I am for preserving inviolably the democratic branch of the 
government. True we have found inconveniences from pure 
democracies ; but if we mean to preserve peace and real freedom, 
they must necessarily become a component part of the national 
system. Change this necessary principle, and if the government 
proceeds to taxation, the States will oppose your powers." 3 

When the motion was considered of the election of 
the first branch for two years, George Mason observed, 
" that the States being differently situated, such a rule 
ought to be formed as would put them as nearly as possible 
on a level. If elections were annual, the middle States 
would have a great advantage over the extreme ones. He 
wished them to be biennial, and the rather as in that case 
they would coincide with the periodical elections of South 
Carolina, as well of the other States." 3 On the subject of the 
" fixed stipends to be paid out of the national treasury " 
to the representatives, Colonel Mason moved to change the 
phraseology of the resolve ; that is to say, " to receive an

124 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

adequate compensation for their services, and to be paid out 
of the treasury," which motion was agreed to. 1 

Jefferson, in characterizing George Mason s merits as a 
public speaker, notices the " touch of biting cynicism " which 
sometimes seasoned his arguments. Examples of this qual 
ity are to be found in the following passages. The question 
of the age required for members of Congress was brought 
up by Colonel Mason, and he moved to insert " twenty-five 
years of age as a qualification for members of the first 
branch." He " thought it absurd that a man to-day should 
not be permitted by the law to make a bargain for himself, 
and to-morrow should be authorized to manage the affairs 
of a great nation. It was the more extraordinary as every 
man carried with him, in his own experience, a scale for 
measuring the deficiency of young politicians ; since he 
would, if interrogated, be obliged to declare that his politi 
cal opinions at the age of twenty-one were too crude and 
erroneous to merit an influence on public measures. It had 
been said, that Congress had proved a good school for our 
young men. It might be so, for anything he knew ; but if 
it were, he chose that they should bear the expence of their 
own education." 2 The exclusive clause in the third resolve 
being under consideration, George Mason spoke as follows: 

" It seems as if it were taken for granted that all offices will 
be filled by the Executive, while I think many will remain in the 
gift of the legislature. In either case it is necessary to shut the 
door against corruption. If otherwise, they may make or multi 
ply offices in order to fill them. Are gentlemen in earnest when 
they suppose that this exclusion will prevent the first characters 
from coming forward ? Are we not struck at seeing the luxury 
and venality which has already crept in among us ? If not 
checked, we shall have ambassadors to every petty State in 
Europe ; the little republic of St. Marino not excepted. We 
must in the present system remove the temptation. I admire 
many parts of the British constitution and government, but I

MASON REPLIES TO MADISON AND WILSON. 12$ 

detest their corruption. Why has the power of the Crown in 
creased, so remarkably increased, the last century ? A stranger, 
by reading their laws, would suppose it considerably diminished ; 
and yet by the sole power of appointing the increased officers of 
the government, corruption pervades every town and village in 
the kingdom. If such a restriction should abridge the right of 
election, it is still necessary, as it will prevent the people from 
ruining themselves. And will not the same causes here produce 
the same effects ? I consider this clause as the corner-stone on 
which our liberties depend ; and if we strike it out, we are erect 
ing a fabric for our destruction." * 

The subject was continued on the following day, June 
23d, when Madison renewed his motion to render the mem 
bers of the first branch " ineligible during their term of ser 
vice, and for one year after, to such offices only, as should 
be established, or the emolument augmented, by the legis 
lature of the United States during the time of their being 
members." Colonel Mason " thought the motion of his 
colleague but a partial remedy for the evil. He appealed 
to him as a witness of the shameful partiality of the legis 
lature of Virginia to its own members. He enlarged on 
the abuses and corruption in the British Parliament con 
nected with the appointment of its members. He could not 
suppose that a sufficient number of citizens could not be 
found who would be ready, without the inducement of eligi 
bility to offices, to undertake the legislative service. Genius 
and virtue, it may be said [he here alluded to some remarks 
of Mr. Wilson], ought to be encouraged. Genius, for aught 
he knew might ; but that virtue should be encouraged by 
such a species of venality, was an idea that at least had the 
merit of being new." 2 Yates, in reporting this speech, gives 
the substance of the last clause in these words : 

" It is asserted that it will be very difficult to find men suffi 
ciently qualified as legislators without the inducement of emolu-

126 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

ments. I do believe that men of genius will be deterred unless 
possessed of great virtues. We may well dispense with the first 
characters when destitute of virtue. I should wish them never 
to come forward. But if we do not provide against corruption, 
our government will soon be at an end ; nor would I wish to 
put a man of virtue in the way of temptation. Evasions and 
caballing [he continued] would evade the amendment. Nor 
would the danger be less, if the executive has the appointment 
of officers. The first three or four years we might go on well 
enough, but what would be the case afterwards ? I will add, that 
such a government ought to be refused by the people ; and it 
will be refused." 

On the 25th of June, the vexed question of the mode of 
appointing the Senate was brought up, Mr. Wilson moving 
that the members be elected by electors chosen by the 
people. This was a point which divided, as a class, the 
large and small States, the former advocating proportional 
representation in both Houses, the latter opposing it, and, as 
Bancroft observes, the election of the Senate by the State 
legislatures was looked upon " as the stepping-stone to an 
equal representation." : And while Virginia s vote went 
with that of Pennsylvania against a doctrine so important 
for the preservation of the individual commonwealth, it was 
one of Virginia s representatives who consistently supported 
it as a pillar of States-rights. " It has been agreed, on all 
hands," said George Mason, "that an efficient government 
is necessary ; that to render it such, it ought to have the 
faculty of self-defence ; that to render its different branches 
effectual each of them ought to have the same power of 
self-defence. He did not wonder that such an agreement 
should have prevailed on these points. He only wondered 
that there should be any disagreement about the necessity 
of allowing the State governments the same self-defence. If 
they are to be preserved, as he conceived to be essential, 
they certainly ought to have this power ; and the only mode

left of giving it to them was by allowing them to appoint 
the second branch of the national legislature." Dr. John 
son, of Connecticut, in advocating this means of self-defence 
for the States, gives George Mason credit as the author 
of the scheme. " This is the idea of Col. Mason, who 
appears to have looked to the bottom of this matter." 
Much has been written, of late, on the " Connecticut Com 
promise," as Bancroft styles it, the equal representation of 
the States in the Senate, and here is one of the three repre 
sentatives from Connecticut who urged the measure upon 
the Convention avowing that it was the " idea " of Colonel 
Mason, that the States should appoint the members of the 
Senate, the " stepping-stone " to equal representation. The 
proportional representation in the first branch, which would 
make the large States more powerful there, was acquiesced 
in by the small States in consideration that an equality in 
the Senate would give them the same voice in its councils as 
their more powerful sisters. The small States, led by Con 
necticut, finally effected this settlement in the Convention. 
But Sherman, Ellsworth, and Johnson only made practical 
an idea independently evolved by the Virginia statesman, 
who, wiser than his colleagues, had " looked to the bottom 
of this matter." Madison, in the Federalist, frankly avowed 
his subsequent conversion to the equality of votes in the 
Senate, which he opposed throughout the sessions of the 
Convention. 3 

A recent writer says : 

" The adoption of different bases for the two Houses, the 
House of Representatives representing the States according to 
population while the Senate represented them equally, was one 
of the most important pieces of work which the Convention 
accomplished, as well as the one which it reached most unwil-

latures, he is entitled to some of the credit for this measure.

lingly. All the States experimenting to find different bases for 
their two Houses, Virginia had come nearest to the appearance 
of the final result, in having her Senate chosen by districts and 
her Representatives by counties ; and as the Union already had 
its ( districts formed (in the States) one might think that the 
Convention merely followed Virginia s experience. But the real 
process was far different and more circuitous." 

In fact, says this writer, it was the Connecticut system, 
where the towns were equally represented in the lower 
House, while the upper one was chosen from the whole 
people, which was the model proposed by Connecticut dele 
gates to the Convention. 1 George Mason, however, stand 
ing apart from his colleagues, did, in effect, propose the 
Virginia constitution, of which he was the author, as a type 
for the new constitution, when he advocated both ideas 
combined equal and unequal representation, for the legis 
lature of the Union, or the choice of one House by the 
people and of the other by the States. 

In regard to the qualifications of senators, Colonel Mason 
thought that u one important object in constituting the 
Senate was to secure the rights of property. To give them 
weight and firmness for this purpose, a considerable duration 
in office was thought necessary. But a longer term than six 
years would be of no avail in this respect, if needy persons 
should be appointed. He suggested, therefore, the pro 
priety of annexing to the office a qualification of property. 
He thought this would be very practicable, as the rules of 
taxation would supply a scale for measuring the degree of 
wealth possessed by every man." 

It was now nearly the last of June. Five weeks, as Dr. 
Franklin anxiously noted, had been spent in trying to 
reconcile the opposing views that were to be found in the 
Convention ; to steer between the rock of centralized gov 
ernment and the whirlpool, as it was deemed, of a pure

Review, Sept., 1887.

LETTER TO HIS SON GEORGE. 1 29 

confederation ; to decide upon the features of the equitable 
via media. " Groping as it were in the dark to find political 
truth, and scarce able to distinguish it when they found it," 
it were well, Dr. Franklin thought to implore for them 
selves each day the Divine guidance. The proposal came a 
little late, it is true, and there might be reason to think, as 
was suggested, that it would alarm the people. But surely 
the daily consecration was needed, and the proposition 
should have been agreed to. On the question for allowing 
each State one vote in the Senate, there seemed to be 
at this time no hope of a settlement. It was then deter 
mined to appoint a committee, consisting of one member 
from each State, in order, if possible, to effect a solution of 
the difficulty. George Mason was the significant choice 
from Virginia, and the Convention adjourned from Monday 
the 2d, to Thursday the 5th, of July. 

The following letters were written by Colonel Mason to 
George Mason, Jr.. and to Beverley Randolph during the 
month of June. The solemn words to his son on the great 
responsibility of the work in which he was engaged, evince 
George Mason s profound sense of duty, and his earnest 
desire to carry out its obligations. 

PHILADELPHIA, June ist, 1787. 
DEAR GEORGE : 

. . . The idea 1 formerly mentioned to you, before the 
Convention met, of a great national council, consisting of two 
branches of the legislature, a judiciary and an executive, upon 
the principle of fair representation in the legislature, with powers 
adapted to the great objects of the Union, and consequently a 
control in these instances, on the State legislatures, is still the 
prevalent one. Virginia has had the honor of presenting the 
outlines of the plan, upon which the convention is proceeding ; 
but so slowly that it is impossible to judge when the business will 
be finished, most probably not before August festina lente may 
very well be called our motto. When I first came here, judging 
from casual conversations with gentlemen from the different 
States, I was very apprehensive that soured and disgusted with 



130 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



the unexpected evils we had experienced from the democratic 
principles of our governments, we should be apt to run into the 
opposite extreme, and in endeavoring to steer too far from 
Scylla, we might be drawn into the vortex of Charybdis, of 
which I still think there is some danger, though I have the 
pleasure to find in the convention, many men of fine republican 
principles. America has certainly, upon this occasion, drawn 
forth her first characters ; there are upon this Convention many 
gentlemen of the most respectable abilities, and so far as I can 
discover, of the purest intentions. The eyes of the United States 
are turned upon this assembly, and their expectations raised to a 
very anxious degree. 

May God grant, we may be able to gratify them, by establishing 
a wise and just government. For my own part, I never before 
felt myself in such a situation ; and declare I would not, upon 
pecuniary motives, serve in this convention for a thousand 
pounds per day. -The revolt from Great Britain and the for 
mations of our new governments at that time, were nothing 
compared to the great business now before us : there was then 
a certain degree of enthusiasm, which inspired and supported 
the mind ; but to view, through the calm, sedate medium of rea 
son the influence which the establishment now proposed may 
have upon the happiness or misery of millions yet unborn, is an 
object of such magnitude, as absorbs, and in a manner suspends 
the operations of the human understanding. 

Remember me kindly to Betsy and all the family ; let me know 
from time to time how they do. I am, dear George, 
Your affectionate father, 

G. MASON. 

P. S. All communications of the proceedings are forbidden 
during the sitting of the Convention ; this I think was a necessary 
precaution to prevent misrepresentations or mistakes ; there be 
ing a material difference between the appearance of a subject in 
its first crude and undigested shape, and after it shall have been 
properly matured and arranged. 

I would thank you to desire Thomson to send me, if he can 
find it, the plan I drew, two or three years ago, for equalizing the 
Virginia land tax, which I have promised a copy of to the North 
Carolina delegates ; I believe he will find it among the loose

papers on the right hand division of the second drawer in my 
desk and bookcase in the little parlor ; and I should be glad to 
have the strictures I wrote some time ago, upon the port bill ; 
but where it is I don t remember ; it lay among the loose papers 
in one of the dining-room windows, which a little before I left 
home I tied up in a bundle and I believe put into one of the 
pigeon-holes in the bookcase in the dining-room, but am not cer 
tain. Pray desire him in looking over the papers, not to dissort 
them, but make them up again together, in the same separate 
bundles, and where any of the bundles are endorsed, to make 
them up again with the endorsations on the outside. 

G. M. 1 

George Mason to Hon. Beverley Randolph : 

PHILADELPHIA, June soth, 1787. 
DEAR SIR : 

The Convention having resolved that none of their proceedings 
should be communicated during their sitting, puts it out of my 
power to give you any particular information upon the subject. 
Festina hnte seems hitherto to have been our maxim. Things, 
however, are now drawing to that point on which some of the 
fundamental principles must be decided, and two or three days 
will probably enable us to judge which is at present very 
doubtful whether any sound and effectual system can be estab 
lished or not. If it cannot, I presume we shall not continue 
here much longer ; if it can, we shall probably be detained til 
September. 

I feel myself disagreeably circumstanced in being the only 
member of the Assembly in the Virginia delegation, and, conse 
quently, if any system shall be recommended by the Convention 
that the whole weight of explanation must fall upon me ; and if 
I should be prevented by sickness or accident from attending the 
Assembly, that it will be difficult for the Assembly to obtain such 
information as may be necessary upon the subject, as I presume 
that in the progress through the legislature many questions may 
be asked and inquiries made, in which satisfactory information, 
from time to time, can hardly be given but by a member of the 
House in his place.

We have just received information here that Mr. Wythe has 
made a resignation, and does not intend to return. Under these 
circumstances I would beg leave to submit it to the consideration 
of the Executive, whether it might not be proper to fill the vacancy 
in the delegation, occasioned by Mr. Wythe s resignation, with 
some member of the Assembly. Mr. Corbin being here, his ap 
pointment, if it shall be judged proper, would occasion little 
additional charge to the State, if the Convention should, unfor 
tunately, break up without adopting any substantial system that 
event will happen, I think before the appointment can reach 
this place ; if the Convention continues to proceed on the busi 
ness, with a prospect of success, Mr. Corbin is on the spot ; and 
I doubt it may be difficult to prevail on any member of the 
Assembly, now in Virginia, to come hither at this late stage of 
the business. 

I beg you will do me the favor to lay this subject before the 
Council, and believe me, with the greatest esteem and regard, 

Dear Sir, 
Your most obedient servant, 

G. MASON. 

The report of the grand committee, which was made on 
the 5th of July, consisted of two propositions made mutually 
conditional. The compromise consisted in giving the first 
branch of the legislature the power of originating money 
bills, a concession, as it was maintained, made by the small 
States in order that the large States should concede the 
equal vote in the Senate. There had been hot and hasty 
words in the Convention, and threats of secession, and of 
looking to foreign countries for assistance. And it was felt 
that a crisis had come and a determined effort must be made 
to meet it. In reply to animadversions on the report, George 
Mason explained that it " was meant not as a specific propo 
sition to be adopted, but merely as a general ground of 
accommodation. There must be some accommodation on 
this point, or we shall make little further progress in the 
work. Accommodation was the object of the House in the 

1 "Virginia Calendar Papers," vol. iv., j&gt;. 310. 



YATES AND LANSING LEAVE THE CONVENTION. 133 

appointment of the committee, and of the committee in 
the report they had made. And however liable the report 
might be to objections, he thought it preferable to an appeal 
to the world by the different sides, as had been talked of by 
some gentlemen. It could not be more inconvenient to any 
gentleman to remain absent from his private affairs, than it 
was for him, but he would bury his bones in this city, rather 
than expose his country to the consequences of a dissolution 
of the Convention without anything being done." A mo 
tion was made to put restrictions upon the representation of 
the Western States, when Colonel Mason said " the case of 
new States was not unnoticed in the committee ; but it was 
thought, and he was himself decidedly of opinion, that if 
they made a part of the Union, they ought to be subject to 
no unfavorable discriminations. Obvious considerations 
required it." : And in this opinion Edmund Randolph 
concurred. 

The minutes of Judge Yates cease at this time, as he and 
his colleague, Mr. Lansing, left the Convention on the 6th 
of July, thoroughly dissatisfied with the course matters were 
taking. The first proposition in the report was under dis 
cussion on this day. This fixed the representation in the 
first branch as " one member for every forty thousand 
inhabitants." It was moved by Gouverneur Morris to refer 
this to a select committee of five. With it went the clause 
relating to money bills, and Dr. Franklin thought they could 
not be voted for separately. George Mason then suggested 
a reference of the rest of the report to the committee just 
appointed. He urged that " the consideration which weighed 
with the committee [the grand committee that reported on 
the 5th] was, that the first branch would be the immediate 
representatives of the people ; the second would not ; should 
the latter have the power of giving away the people s money, 
they might soon forget the source from whence they received 
it. We might soon have an aristocracy. He had been much 

" Madison Papers, "vol. ii., p. 1033.

134 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

concerned at the principles which had been advanced by 
some gentlemen, but had the satisfaction to find they did 
not generally prevail. He was a friend to proportional 
representation in both branches, but supposed that some 
points must be yielded for the sake of accommodation." 
The clause allowing each State one vote in the second 
branch was taken up and agreed to on the /th. And on the 
9th the report of the committee of five on the clause fixing 
representation in the first branch of the legislature was given 
to the Convention. This altered the representation from 
" one member to every forty thousand inhabitants," and 
gave fifty-six members for the first Congress, and this num 
ber to be augmented from time to time. The change did 
not give satisfaction, and the first part of the report was 
then put into the hands of another grand committee, Madi 
son this time being the member selected from Virginia. 
And here the representation was augmented to sixty-five 
members. But it was becoming more and more apparent 
that the question of the balance of power was not so much 
between the large and small States as between the Northern 
and Southern States, and the Southern members contended 
that the changes made in the representation of the House 
were unfavorable to the South. Mr. Madison proposed to 
double the number from each State ; some of the Northern 
members were for a reduction, urging the expense. Mr. 
Gerry, however, proposed to increase the number. George 
Mason " admitted that the objection drawn from the con 
sideration of expense had weight both in itself and as the 
people might be affected by it. But he thought it out 
weighed by the objections against the smallness of the 
number. Thirty-eight will, he supposes, as being a majority 
of sixty-five, form a quorum. Twenty will be a majority of 
thirty-eight. This was certainly too small a number to make 
laws for America. They would neither bring with them all 
the necessary information relative to local interests, nor 
possess the necessary confidence of the people. After 

1 Ibid., pp. 1040-1042. 



THE PROPER RULE OF REP RE SENT A TION. 135 



doubling the number, the laws might still be made by so 
few as almost to be objectionable on that account." Mr. 
Madison s motion being lost, and the report of the commit 
tee of eleven agreed to, Edmund Randolph moved that the 
legislature take a periodical census to redress inequalities in 
the representation. Colonel Mason here gave expression to 
his fears, that the South would not be sufficiently secured 
in her rights by the new Constitution : 

" The greater the difficulty we find in fixing a proper rule of 
representation, the more unwilling ought we to be to throw the 
task from ourselves on the General Legislature. He did not 
object to the conjectural ratio which was to prevail in the outset ; 
but considered a revision from time to time, according to some 
permanent and precise standard, as essential to the fair repre 
sentation required in the first branch. According to the present 
population of America, the Northern part of it had a right to 
preponderate ; and he could not deny it. But he wished it not 
to preponderate hereafter, when the reason no longer continued. 
From the nature of man, we may be sure that those who have 
power in their hands will not give it up, while they can retain it. 
On the contrary, we know that they will always, when they can, 
rather increase it. If the Southern States, therefore, should have 
three-fourths of the people of America within their limits, the 
Northern will hold fast the majority of representatives. One- 
fourth will govern the three-fourths. The Southern States will 
complain, but they may complain from generation to generation 
without redress. Unless some principle, therefore, which will do 
justice to them hereafter shall be inserted in the Constitution, 
disagreeable as the declaration was to him, he must declare he 
could neither vote for the system here, nor support it in his 
State. Strong objections had been drawn from the danger to 
the Atlantic interests from new Western States. Ought we to 
sacrifice what we know to be right in itself, lest it should prove 
favorable to States which are not yet in existence ? If the 
Western States are to be admitted into the Union, as they arise, 
they must, he would repeat, be treated as equals, and subjected 
to no degrading discriminations. They will have the same pride, 

1 Ibid . , ]&gt;. 1061. 



136 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



and other passions, which we have ; and will either not unite 
with, or will speedily revolt from, the Union, if they are not in 
all respects placed on an equal footing with their brethren. It 
has been said, they will be poor, and unable to make equal con 
tributions to the general treasury. He did not know but that, in 
time, they would be both more numerous and more wealthy than 
their Atlantic brethren. The extent and fertility of their soil 
made this probable ; and though Spain might for a time deprive 
them of the natural outlet for their productions, yet she will, be 
cause she must, finally yield to their demands. He urged that 
numbers of inhabitants, though not always a precise standard of 
wealth, was sufficiently so for every substantial purpose." 1 

The representation to be regulated on a census of the free 
white inhabitants and three fifths of the slaves was the next 
proposition discussed. Some of the Northern members of 
the Convention were opposed to any representation of the 
slaves, while the extreme Southern delegates insisted that 
they should be counted equally with the whites. The three- 
fifths basis was another one of the compromises of the Con 
stitution. George Mason advocated it, and on a motion for 
an equal representation of the blacks, declared he " could 
not agree to the motion, notwithstanding it was favorable 
to Virginia, because he thought it unjust. It was certain 
that the slaves were valuable, as they raised the value of 
land, increased the exports and imports, and of course the 
revenue, would supply the means of feeding and supporting 
an army, and might in cases of emergency become them 
selves soldiers. As in these important respects they were 
useful to the community at large, they ought not to be 
excluded from the estimate of representation. He could 
not, however, regard them as equal to freemen, and could 
not vote for them as such. He added, as worthy of remark, 
that the Southern States have this peculiar species of prop 
erty, over and above the other species of property common 
to all the States." a Mr. Sherman said that he had become 
convinced by the observations of Mr. Randolph and Colonel 

1 Ibid., p. 1064. - Ibid., p. 1068. 



MOTION MADE BY GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 137 

Mason that the periods and the rule of revising the rep 
resentation ought to be fixed by the Constitution. George 
Mason " objected to a motion [made by Rutledge] to 
include wealth with population in the estimate, as requiring 
of the legislature something too indefinite and impracticable, 
and leaving them a pretext for doing nothing." In reply 
to Gouverneur Morris, who reiterated his objections to 
admitting the Western country on an equal footing with the 
Atlantic States, Colonel Mason, while agreeing with him, 
" that we ought to leave the interests of the people to the 
representatives of the people," said, that " the objection 
was, that the legislature would cease to be the representa 
tives of the people. It would continue so no longer than 
the States now containing a majority of the people should 
retain that majority. As soon as the southern and western 
population should predominate, which must happen in a 
few years, the power would be in the hands of the minority, 
and \vould never be yielded to the majority, unless provided 
for by the Constitution." 

Gouverneur Morris startled the Convention on the I2th 
by a proposal that " taxation should be in proportion to 
representation." This was a blow aimed at the Southern 
proposition for a full representation of the slaves. George 
Mason in reply " admitted the justice of the principle but 
was afraid embarrassments might be occasioned to the legis 
lature by it. It might drive the legislature to the plan 
of requisitions." Morris then limited his motion to direct 
taxation, and this was agreed to. After a little further 
skirmishing, it was finally decided that representation 
should be proportioned to direct taxation, and both to the 
number of the free white and three fifths of the slave popu 
lation. On a motion to assess the inhabitants of the States, 
until a census could be taken according to the number 
of their representatives in the first branch, Colonel Mason 
said he " did not know that Virginia would be a loser by the 
proposed regulation, but had some scruple as to the justice 

1 Ibid., p. 1071. 2 Ibid., p. 1075. 3 Ibid., p. 1089. 



138 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



of it. He doubted much whether the conjectural rule 
which was to precede the census would be as just as it 
would be rendered by an actual census." The equal vote 
in the Senate was the next disputed point taken up. The 
small States refused to confederate on any other terms, and 
the large States as a class still opposed it. On the i6th 
an adjournment was voted to enable the dissatisfied ones to 
talk over the subject, and the result was satisfactory, for the 
compromise was finally effected at this time. 

1 Ibid., p. 1089. 




CHAPTER V. 

THE CHAMPION OF STATES-RIGHTS. 
July-September, 1787. 

The mode of electing the Executive was under discussion 
on the 1 7th of July. George Mason approved of an election 
by the legislature rather than by the people at large. In 
animadverting upon some of the opinions that had been ex 
pressed, Colonel Mason said : 

" It is curious to remark the different language held at different 
times. At one moment we are told that the legislature is entitled 
to thorough confidence, and to indefinite power. At another, that 
it will be governed by intrigue and corruption, and cannot be 
trusted at all. But not to dwell on this inconsistency, he would 
observe that a government which is to last ought at least to be 
practicable. Would this be the case if the proposed election 
should be left to the people at large ? He conceived it would be 
as unnatural to refer the choice of a proper character for Chief 
Magistrate to the people, as it would, to refer a trial of colors to 
a blind man. The extent of the country renders it impossible, 
that the people can have the requisite capacity to judge of the 
respective pretensions of the candidates." 1 

On a motion to strike out seven years as the term of office 
for the Executive, and substitute " during good behaviour," 
Colonel Mason spoke decisively against it : 

" This motion was made some time ago, and negatived by a 
very large majority. He trusted that it would be again negatived. 
1 " Madison Papers," vol. ii., p. 1122. 
139 



140 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

It would be impossible to define the misbehaviour in such a man 
ner as to subject it to a proper trial ; and perhaps still more im 
possible to compel so high an offender, holding his office by such 
a tenure, to submit to a trial. He considered an executive during 
good behaviour as a softer name only for an executive for life. 
And that the next would be an easy step to hereditary monarchy. 
If the motion should finally succeed, he might himself live to see 
such a revolution. If he did not, it was probable his children or 
grandchildren would. He trusted there were few men in that 
House who wished for it. No State, he was sure, had so far re 
volted from republican principles, as to have the least bias in its 
favor." 

On the 1 8th the subject of the judiciary was discussed, and 
it was proposed that the judges should be appointed " by the 
Executive with the consent of the Senate," instead of by the 
Senate as declared in the eleventh resolution of the report. 
George Mason spoke as follows : 

" The mode of appointing the judges may depend in some de 
gree on the mode of trying impeachments of the executive. If 
the judges were to form a tribunal for that purpose they surely 
ought not to be appointed by the executive. There were in 
superable objections besides against referring the appointment to 
the executive. He mentioned as one, that as the seat of govern 
ment must be in some one State ; and as the executive would re 
main in office for a considerable time, for four, five or six years 
at least, he would insensibly form local and personal attachments 
within the particular State that would deprive equal merit else 
where of an equal chance of promotion." 

Concerning the twelfth resolution, " that the national legis 
lature be empowered to appoint inferior tribunals," Colonel 
Mason " thought many circumstances might arise, not now 
to be foreseen, which might render such a power absolutely 
necessary." : Objections being made to the sixteenth reso 
lution guaranteeing a republican constitution to each State 
by the United States, George Mason said, " if the general 

1 Ibid., p. 1127. Ibid., p. 1131. * Ibid., p. 1137. 



POWERS OF THE JUDICIARY. 141 

government should have no right to suppress rebellions 
against particular States, it will be in a bad situation indeed. 
As rebellions against itself originate in and against individual 
States, it must remain a passive spectator of its own subver- 



The appointment of the Executive through electors having 
been decided upon, the question of impeachment was re 
sumed. Colonel Mason declared : 

" No point is of more importance than that the right of im 
peachment should be continued. Shall any man be above jus 
tice ? Above all, shall that man be above it who can commit the 
most extensive injustice ? When great crimes were committed, 
he was for punishing the principal as well as the coadjutors. 
There had been much debate and difficulty as to the mode of 
choosing the executive. He approved of that which had been 
adopted at first, namely, of referring the appointment to the na 
tional legislature. One objection against electors was the danger 
of their being corrupted by the candidates, and this furnished a 
peculiar reason in favor of impeachment whilst in office. Shall the 
man who has practised corruption, and by that means procured 
his appointment in the first instance, be suffered to escape punish 
ment by repeating his guilt ? " 

On the motion to associate the judiciary "with the execu 
tive in the revisionary power," Colonel Mason said, "he had 
always been a friend to this provision. It would give a con 
fidence to the executive, which he would not otherwise have, 
and without which the revisionary power would be of little 
avail." He urged again, " that the defence of the executive 
was not the sole object of the revisionary power. He ex 
pected even greater advantages from it. Notwithstanding 
the precautious taken in the constitution of the legislature, 
it would still so much resemble that of the individual States, 
that it must be expected frequently to pass unjust and per 
nicious laws. This restraining power was therefore essen 
tially necessary. It would have the effect, not only of 

1 Ibid., p. 1139. 2 Ibid., p. 1154. 



142 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



hindering the final passage of such laws, but would discour 
age demagogues from attempting to get them passed. It 
has been said (by Mr. Luther Martin), that if the judges 
were joined in this check on the laws, they would have a 
double negative, since in their expository capacity of judges 
they would have one negative. He would reply, that in this 
capacity they could impede, in one case only, the operation 
of laws. They could declare an unconstitutional law void. 
But with regard to every law, however unjust, oppressive or 
pernicious, that did not come plainly under this description, 
they would be under the necessity, as judges, to give it a 
free course. He wished the further use to be made of the 
judges of giving aid in preventing every improper law. Their 
aid will be the more valuable, as they are in the habit and 
practice of considering laws in their true principles, and in 
all their consequences." 

In regard to the appointment of judges, Mr. Madison 
made the motion that they should be nominated by the 
Executive, and the appointments so made, unless disagreed 
to by two thirds of the Senate, were to hold good. Governor 
Randolph favored the motion. Colonel Mason did not 
assent to it ; he " found it his duty to differ from his col 
leagues in their opinions and reasonings on this subject. 
Notwithstanding the form of the proposition, by which the 
appointment seemed to be divided between the executive 
and Senate, the appointment was substantially vested in the 
former alone. The false complaisance which usually pre 
vails in such cases will prevent a disagreement to the first 
nominations. He considered the appointment by the ex 
ecutive as a dangerous prerogative. It might even give him 
an influence over the judiciary department itself. He did 
not think the difference of interest between the Northern 
and Southern States could be properly brought into this 
argument. It would operate, and require some precautions 
in the case of regulating navigation, commerce, and imposts ; 
but he could not see that it had any connect i with the 
* Ibid., pp. 1163-1168. 



APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES. 143 



judiciary department." Madison had contended that ap 
pointments by the Senate would give the balance of power 
to the Northern States. The committee had given the 
appointment of judges to the second branch of the legisla 
ture, but a motion had been made on the i8th to alter 
this decision, which was revived by Madison. 

On the 23d the Convention debated on the mode of ratify 
ing the Constitution. Should it be by the States through their 
legislatures, or by conventions of the people in each State? 
George Mason warmly espoused the latter alternative. He 
" considered a reference of the plan to the authority of the 
people as one of the most important and essential of the 
resolutions. The legislatures have no power to ratify it. 
They are the mere creatures of the State constitutions, and 
cannot be greater than their creators. And he knew of no 
power in any of the constitutions he knew there was no 
power in some of them that could be competent to this 
object. Whither, then, must we resort ? To the people, 
with whom all power remains that has not been given up in 
the constitutions derived from them. It was of great mo 
ment, he observed, that this doctrine should be cherished, as 
the basis of free government. Another strong reason was 
that, admitting the legislatures to have a competent authority, 
it would be wrong to refer the plan to them, because suc 
ceeding legislatures, having equal authority, could undo the 
acts of their predecessors; and the national government 
would stand in each State on the weak and tottering foun 
dation of an act of Assembly. There was a remaining con 
sideration of some weight. In some of the States, the gov 
ernments were not derived from the clear and undisputed 
authority of the people. This was the case in Virginia. 
Some of the best and wisest citizens considered the Consti 
tution as established by an assumed authority. A national 
constitution derived from such a source would be exposed 
to the severest criticism." 

A moti was made that the members of the Senate

144 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

should vote/^r capita, and that the number from each State 
should be three. Colonel Mason thought " three from each 
State, including new States, would make the second branch 
too numerous. Besides other objections, the additional 
expense ought always to form one, where it was not abso 
lutely necessary." The puzzling question of the mode of 
electing the Executive was discussed on the 24th and 25th. 
Among other plans, the motion was made that he should be 
appointed by the legislature, and be not eligible " for more 
than six years in any twelve years." Colonel Mason ap 
proved the suggestion : 

" It had the sanction of experience in the instance of Congress, 
and some of the executives of the States. It rendered the exec 
utive as effectually independent as an ineligibility after his first 
election ; and opened the way, at the same time, for the advan 
tage of his future services. He preferred on the whole the 
election by the national legislature ; though candor obliged him 
to admit, that there was great danger of foreign influence, as had 
been suggested. This was the most serious objection, with him, 
that had been urged." ! 

On the 24th of July, the twenty-three resolutions which 
the Convention had elaborated from the nineteen resolutions 
reported on the igth of June were referred to a Committee 
of Detail to be shaped into a constitution. This committee 
consisted of five members, Gorham, Ellsworth, Wilson, Ran 
dolph, and Rutledge, three Northern and two Southern 
men. The resolution on the Executive was not given to the 
committee until the 26th. On this day George Mason 
made the opening speech in the Convention, passing in 
review the various propositions that had been made in 
regard to the subject under discussion : 

" In every stage of the question relative to the executive, the 
difficulty of the subject and the diversity of the opinions concern 
ing it, have appeared. Nor have any of the modes of constitut 
ing that department been satisfactory. First, it has been proposed 
that the election should be made by the people at large ; that is, 
1 Ibid., p. 1185. - Ibid., p. 1202. 



SPEECH ON MODE OF ELECTING THE EXECUTIVE. 145 

that an act which ought to be performed by those who know 
most of eminent characters and qualifications, should be per 
formed by those who know least ; secondly, that the election 
should be made by the legislatures of the States ; thirdly, by the 
executives of the States. Against these modes, also, strong ob 
jections have been urged. Fourthly, it has been proposed that 
the election should be made by electors chosen by the people for 
that purpose. This was at first agreed to ; but on further consid 
eration has been rejected. Fifthly, since which, the mode of 
Mr. Williamson, requiring each freeholder to vote for several 
candidates, has been proposed. This seemed, like many other 
propositions, to carry a plausible face, but on closer inspection is 
liable to fatal objections. A popular election in any form, as 
Mr. Gerry has observed, would throw the appointment into the 
hands of the Cincinnati, a society for the members of which 
he had a great respect, but which he never wished to have a 
preponderating influence in the government. Sixthly, another 
expedient was proposed by Mr. Dickinson, which is liable to 
so palpable and material an inconvenience, that he had little 
doubt of its being by this time rejected by himself. It would ex 
clude every man who happened not to be popular within his own 
State ; though the causes of his local unpopularity might be of 
such a nature, as to recommend him to the States at large. 
Seventhly, among other expedients, a lottery has been intro 
duced. But as the tickets do not appear to be in much demand, 
it will probably not be carried on, and nothing therefore need be 
said on that subject. After reviewing all these various modes, 
he was led to conclude, that an election by the national legisla 
ture, as originally proposed, was the best. If it was liable to 
objections, it was liable to fewer than any other. He conceived, 
at the same time, that a second election ought to be absolutely 
prohibited. Having for his primary object for the polar star of 
his political conduct the preservation of the rights of the peo 
ple, he held it as an essential point, as the very palladium of civil 
liberty, that the great officers of state, and particularly the execu 
tive, should at fixed periods return to that mass from which they 
were at first taken, in order that they may feel and respect those 
rights and interests which are again to be personally valuable to 
them."

146 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

He concluded with moving, that the constitution of the 
Executive, as reported by the Committee of the Whole, 
be reinstated, viz. : " that the executive be appointed for 
seven years [by the legislature] and be ineligible a second 
time." Mr. Dickinson s proposition had been that each 
State should select its best citizen, and out of the thirteen 
names the Executive should be chosen, either by the na 
tional legislature or by electors appointed by it. It was 
from Mr. Wilson of Pennsylvania, that the singular scheme 
emanated, which called forth George Mason s shrewd sar 
casm. This was, to elect the Executive for six years, by not 
more than fifteen of the members of the legislature, these 
members to be drawn from it not by ballot but by lot, and 
they were to retire immediately and make the election with 
out separating. Colonel Mason s resolution passing in the 
affirmative, he then moved " that the Committee of Detail 
be instructed to receive a clause requiring certain qualifica 
tions of landed property and citizenship of the United 
States, in members of the national legislature ; and dis 
qualifying persons having unsettled accounts with, or being 
indebted to, the United States, from being members of the 
national legislature." He observed " that persons of the 
latter descriptions had frequently got into the State legis 
latures, in order to promote laws that might shelter their 
delinquencies ; and that this evil had crept into Congress, if 
report was to be regarded." 1 Gouverneur Morris opposed 
this discrimination, when Colonel Mason mentioned " the 
parliamentary qualifications adopted in the reign of Queen 
Anne, which he said had met with universal approbation." 
Mr. Morris retorted that these " had been disregarded in 
practice ; and were but a scheme of the landed against the 
monied interest." 2 The first part of Colonel Mason s mo 
tion passed in the affirmative ; the clause disqualifying pub 
lic debtors was lost. He next observed " that it would be 
proper, as he thought, that some provision should be made 
in the Constitution against choosing for the seat of the gen- 

1 Ibid., p. 1211. - Ibid., pp. 1212, 1213. 



PROVISION FOR THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT. 147 

eral government, the city or place at which the seat of any 
State government might be fixed. There were two objec 
tions against having them at the same place, which, without 
mentioning others, required some precaution on the subject. 
The first was, that it tended to produce disputes concerning 
jurisdiction. The second and principal one was, that the in 
termixture of the two legislatures tended to give a provincial 
tincture to the national deliberations." He moved " that 
the committee be instructed to receive a clause to prevent 
the seat of the national government being in the same city 
or town with the seat of the government of any State, 
longer than until the necessary public buildings could be 
erected." There was some opposition to this, and Colonel 
Mason then said " he did not mean to press the motion 
at this time, nor to excite any hostile passions against the 
system. He was content to withdraw the motion for the 
present." The Convention then adjourned from the 26th 
of July to the 6th of August, in order to give the Commit 
tee of Detail time to prepare a constitution. 

The report of the committee delivered to the Convention 
on the 6th of August consisted of twenty-three articles. 2 It 
was taken up the following day for consideration. The pre 
amble, " We, the people of the States of " etc., with the first 
and second articles, was agreed to. The third article was 
debated, and George Mason " doubted the propriety of giv 
ing each branch a negative on the other in all cases/ There 
were some cases in which it was, he supposed, not intended 
to be given, as in the case of balloting for appointments." 
Mr. Morris moved to insert " legislative acts," instead of " in 
all cases." Colonel Mason " thought the amendment of Mr. 
Gouverneur Morris extended too far. Treaties are in a sub 
sequent part declared to be laws ; they will therefore be 
subjected to a negative, although they are to be made, as 
proposed, by the Senate alone. He proposed that the mu 
tual negative should be restrained to cases requiring the 
distinct assent of the two Houses." Mr. Morris considered 

1 Ibid., pp. I2I8-I220. - Ibid., pp. I2I8-I22O. 



148 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

this " but a repetition of the same thing ; the mutual nega 
tive and distinct assent being equivalent expressions. Trea 
ties, he thought, were not laws." * The whole clause in regard 
to a negative was struck out at the instance of Madison, 
and Gouverneur Morris motion passed in the negative. 
Discussion then followed on the concluding clause, ap 
pointing the time for the legislature to meet. Colonel 
Mason " thought the objection against fixing the time 
insuperable ; but that an annual meeting ought to be 
required as essential to the preservation of the Constitu 
tion. The extent of the country will supply business. And 
if it should not, the legislature, besides legislative, is to have 
inquisitorial powers, which cannot safely be long kept in a 
state of suspension." 2 The clause received, at this time, cer 
tain alterations which proved to be final. The qualifications of 
electors coming up for consideration, Mr. Morris wished to 
restrain the right of suffrage to freeholders. The Constitu 
tion left it to the States to decide, each one in its own way. 
George Mason said : 

" The force of habit is certainly not attended to by those gentle 
men who wish for innovations on this point. Eight or nine States 
have extended the right of suffrage beyond the freeholders. What 
will the people there say, if they should be disfranchised ? A 
power to alter the qualifications, would be a dangerous power in 
the hands of the legislature. We all feel too strongly the remains 
of ancient prejudices, and view things too much through a Brit 
ish medium. A freehold is the qualification in England, and 
hence it is imagined to be the only proper one. The true idea, in 
his opinion, was that every man having evidence of attachment 
to, and permanent common interest with, the society, ought to 
share in all its rights and privileges. Was this qualification re 
strained to freeholders ? Does no other kind of property but 
land evidence a common interest in the proprietor ? Does 
nothing besides property mark a permanent attachment ? Ought 
the merchant, the monied man, the parent of a number of chil 
dren whose fortunes are to be pursued in his own country, to be

A 2V IMPORTANT QUESTION DISCUSSED. 149 

viewed as suspicious characters, and unworthy to be trusted with 
the common rights of their fellow citizens ? " 

The second section of the fourth article required of a rep 
resentative that he should have been a citizen of the United 
States at least three years before his election. Colonel 
Mason was " for opening a wide door for emigrants ; but 
did not choose that foreigners and adventurers make laws 
for us and govern us. Citizenship for three years was not 
enough for ensuring that local knowledge which ought to be 
possessed by the representative. This was the principal 
objection to so short a term. It might also happen, that a 
rich foreign nation, for example Great Britain, might send 
over her tools, who might bribe their way into the legisla 
ture for insidious purposes." He moved that " seven " years, 
instead of "three" be inserted. 2 The motion was agreed 
to. It was then proposed to alter the next clause, and 
require a representative to be a resident for a certain term 
of years, of the State which should elect him. George 
Mason thought seven years, which was suggested, too 
long, " but would never agree to part with the principle. 
It is a valuable principle. He thought it a defect in the 
plan, that the representatives would be too few to bring 
with them all the local knowledge necessary. If residence 
be not required, rich men of neighboring States may employ 
with success the means of corruption in some particular dis 
trict, and thereby get into the public councils after having 
failed in their own States. This is the practice in the 
boroughs of England." : He then moved, with Mr. Ells 
worth, to insert " one year " for previous inhabitancy. The 
fifth section, giving the power of originating money-bills to 
the House of Representatives, again met with opposition. 
Colonel Mason said, " he was unwilling to travel over this 
ground again. To strike out the section, was to unhinge 
the compromise of which it made a part. The duration of 
the Senate made it improper. He did not object to that 

1 Ibid., pp. 1250-1252. - Ibid., p. 1256. n Ibid., p. 1259. 



150 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

duration. On the contrary, he approved of it. But joined 
with the smallness of the number, it was an argument against 
adding this to the other great powers vested in that body. 
His idea of an aristocracy was, that it was the government 
of the few over the many. An aristocratic body, like the 
screw in mechanics, working its way by slow degrees, and 
holding fast whatever it gains, should ever be suspected of 
an encroaching tendency. The purse-strings should never be 
put into its hands." The section was struck out, however, 
on the motion of Madison. The next day Edmund Ran 
dolph and others moved to reconsider it. Dr. Franklin be 
lieved the two clauses, the originating of money-bills in the 
House, and the equality of votes in the Senate, were essen 
tially connected by the compromise which had been made 
by the grand committee and reported the 5th of July. 
George Mason thought " this was not the time for discussing 
this point. When the originating of money-bills shall be 
reconsidered, he thought it could be demonstrated, that it 
was of essential importance to restrain the right to the 
House of Representatives, the immediate choice of the 
people." On considering the first section of article fifth, 
Edmund Randolph wished to postpone the last sentence, 
" each member shall have one vote." It \vas observed that 
this could not be necessary, " as in case the sanction as to 
originating money-bills should not be re-instated, and a re 
vision of the Constitution should ensue, it would still be 
proper that the members should vote per capita. A post 
ponement of the preceding sentence, allowing to each State 
two members, would have been more proper." Colonel 
Mason replied, " he did not mean to propose a change of this 
mode of voting per capita in any event. But as there 
might be other modes proposed, he saw no impropriety in 
postponing the sentence. Each State may have two mem 
bers, and yet may have unequal votes. He said that unless 
the exclusive right of originating money-bills should be 
restored to the House of Representatives, he should not

CONSTITUTION APPRO VED OF AS THEN MO ULDED. I 5 I 

from obstinacy, but duty and conscience oppose through 
out the equality of representation in the Senate." 1 The 
third section was taken up and Gouverneur Morris proposed 
to make fourteen year s citizenship, instead of four, a qualifi 
cation for senators. Colonel Mason " highly approved of the 
policy of the motion. Were it not that many, not natives 
of this country, had acquired great credit during the Revo 
lution, he should be for restraining the eligibility into the 
Senate, to natives." Nine years was finally made the 
period of citizenship required. 

In considering article sixth, section third, several of the 
members contended that less than a majority in each House 
should constitute a quorum. George Mason " opposed the 
change. This is a valuable and necessary part of the plan 
he urged. In this extended country, embracing so great a 
diversity of interests, it would be dangerous to the distant 
parts to allow a small number of members of the two 
Houses to make laws. The central States could always 
take care to be on the spot ; and by meeting earlier than the 
distant ones, or worrying their patience, and outstaying 
them, could carry such measures as they pleased. He ad 
mitted that inconveniences might spring from the secession 
of a small number ; but he had also known good produced 
by an apprehension of it. He had known a paper emission 
prevented by that cause in Virginia. He thought the Con 
stitution as now moulded, was founded on sound principles, 
and was disposed to put into it extensive powers. At the 
same time he wished to guard against abuses as much as 
possible. If the legislature should be able to reduce the 
number at all, it might reduce it as low as it pleased, and the 
United States might be governed by a junto. A majority 
of the number which had been agreed on was so few that he 
feared it would be made an objection against the plan." 
The right of expulsion, article sixth, section sixth, Madison 
observed " was too important to be exercised by a bare ma 
jority of a quorum," and he moved that " with the concur- 

1 Ibid., p. 1272. -Ibid., p. 1274. 3 Ibid., p. 1287. 



152 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

rence of two-thirds " might be inserted between " may " and 
"expel/ an amendment that both Randolph and Mason 
approved of. The seventh section, that the yeas and nays 
shall at the desire of one fifth of the members be entered on 
the journal, it was proposed to alter. Some were for allow 
ing any member to call for the yeas and nays, and others 
proposed to strike them out altogether. Colonel Mason 
"liked the section as it stood. It was a middle way between 
two extremes." Whether the clause should be retained, 
that the Congress publish their proceedings from time to 
time, was debated, and George Mason was in favor of it. 
He "thought it would give a just alarm to the people, 
to make a conclave of their legislature." The words, how 
ever, were inserted, " except such parts thereof as may in 
their judgment require secrecy." s Recurring to article 
fourth, section second, Colonel Mason s alteration requiring 
citizenship of the United States for seven years as a qualifi 
cation for representatives, was assailed, and four years sug 
gested as a substitute. Mr. Sherman, in defending the 
theory of the longer term, said that the United States had 
not "pledged their faith" to foreigners, as was asserted, 
giving them equal privileges with native citizens, but the 
individual States had done this, and the former could there 
fore make discriminations. Mr. Madison was shocked at 
this doctrine. Colonel Mason, however, was struck, as he 
said, " not, like Mr. Madison, with the peculiarity, but with 
the propriety, of the doctrine of Mr. Sherman. The States 
have formed different qualifications themselves for enjoying 
different rights of citizenship. Greater caution would be 
necessary in the outset of the government than afterwards. 
All the great objects would then be provided for. Every 
thing would be then set in motion. If persons among us 
attached to Great Britain should work themselves into our 
councils, a turn might be given to our affairs, and particu 
larly to our commercial regulations, which might have 
pernicious consequences. The great houses of British mer-

SPEECH ON ORIGINATING MONEY-BILLS. 153 



chants would spare no pains to insinuate the instruments of 
their views into the government." The important section 
fifth of article fourth was reconsidered again, and Edmund 
Randolph moved to alter the clause in regard to originating 
money-bills by inserting " for the purpose of revenue," and 
allowing amendments by the Senate with certain restrictions. 
Colonel Mason spoke at length on this subject : 

"This amendment removes all objections urged against the 
section, as it stood at first. By specifying purposes of revenue, it 
obviated the objection that the section extended to all bills under 
which money might incidentally arise. By authorizing amend 
ments in the Senate it got rid of the objections that the Senate 
could not correct errors of any sort, and that it would introduce 
into the House of Representatives the practice of tacking foreign 
matter to money bills. These objections being removed, the 
arguments in favor of the proposed restraint on the Senate ought 
to have their full force. First, the Senate did not represent the 
people, but the States, in their political character. It was im 
proper therefore that it should tax the people. The reason was 
the same against their doing it, as it had been against Congress 
doing it. Secondly, nor was it in any respect necessary, in order 
to cure the evils of our republican system. He admitted that, 
notwithstanding the superiority of the republican form over every 
other, it had its evils. The chief ones were, the danger of the 
majority oppressing the minority, and the mischievous influence 
of demagogues. The general government of itself will cure 
them. As the States will not concur at the same time in their 
unjust and oppressive plans, the general government will be able 
to check and defeat them, whether they result from the wicked 
ness of the majority, or from the misguidance of demagogues. 
Again the Senate is not like the House of Representatives, chosen 
frequently, and obliged to return frequently among the people. 
They are to be chosen by the States for six years will probably 
settle themselves at the seat of government will pursue schemes 
for their own aggrandizement will be able by wearying out the 
House of Representatives, and taking advantage of their im 
patience at the close of a long session, to extort measures for that

154 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

purpose. If they should be paid, as he expected would be yet 
determined and wished to be so, out of the national treasury, 
they will, particularly, extort an increase of their wages. A bare 
negative was a very different thing from that of originating bills. 
The practice in England was in point. The House of Lords 
does not represent nor tax the people, because not elected by the 
people. If the Senate can originate, they will, in the recess of 
the legislative sessions, hatch their mischievous projects, for their 
own purposes, and have their money bills cut and dried (to use 
a common phrase) for the meeting of the House of Representa 
tives. He compared the case to Poyning s law, 1 and signified 
that the House of Representatives might be rendered by degrees 
like the parliament of Paris, the mere depository of the decrees 
of the Senate. As to the compromise, so much had passed on 
that subject that he would say nothing about it. He did not 
mean by what he had said, to oppose the permanency of the 
Senate. On the contrary he had no repugnance to an increase 
of it, nor to allowing it a negative, though the Senate was not, by 
its present Constitution, entitled to it. But in all events he would 
contend that the purse strings should be in the hands of the 
representatives of the people." 2 

When article sixth, section ninth, regarding the ineligi- 
bility of members of Congress to office, was debated, and a 
motion was made to alter it, George Mason proposed ironi 
cally " to strike out the whole section, as a more effectual 
expedient for encouraging that exotic corruption which 
might not otherwise thrive so well in the American soil ; 
for completing that aristocracy which was probably in the 
contemplation of some among us ; and for inviting into the 
legislative service those generous and benevolent characters, 
who will do justice to each other s merit, by carving out 
offices and rewards for it. In the present state of American 
morals and manners, few friends, it may be thought, will be

DANGERS OF THE TREATY-MAKING POWER. 155 

lost to the plan, by the opportunity of giving premiums to 
a mercenary and depraved ambition." The tenth section 
provided that members be paid by their respective States. 
The Convention discussed it with special reference to the 
Senate, when Colonel Mason remarked " that the clause as 
it now stands makes the House of Representatives also de 
pendent on the State legislatures ; so that both Houses will be 
made the instruments of the politics of the States, whatever 
they may be." 2 It was finally agreed to pay the members of 
the legislature out of the treasury of the general government. 
It was proposed to amend section twelfth so as to read : 

" Each House shall possess the right of originating all bills, 
except bills for raising money for the purposes of revenue, or for 
appropriating the same, and for fixing the salaries of the officers 
of the government, which shall originate in the House of Repre 
sentatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amend 
ments as in other cases." 

George Mason seconded the motion. " He was extremely 
earnest to take this power from the Senate, who, he said, 
could already sell the whole country by means of treaties." ! 
Mr. Mercer then contended " that the Senate ought not to 
have the power of treaties "; a power which belonged to the 
executive department, adding " that treaties would not be 
final, so as to alter the laws of the land, till ratified by legis 
lative authority." Colonel Mason, to whose observations 
Mr. Mercer had alluded, replied that he " did not say that a 
treaty would repeal a law ; but that the Senate by means of 
treaties might alienate territory, &c., without legislative 
sanction. The cessions of the British islands in the West 
Indies, by treaty alone, were an example. If Spain should 
possess herself of Georgia, therefore, the Senate might by 
treaty dismember the Union. He wished the motion to be 
decided now, that the friends of it might know how to 
conduct themselves."

156 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



The Convention proceeding to article seventh, the first 
section, first clause, giving the legislature power " to lay and 
collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises," was considered, 
and Colonel Mason " urged the necessity of connecting with 
the powers of levying taxes, duties, &c., the prohibition in 
article seventh, section four, l that no tax should be laid on 
exports/ He was unwilling to trust to its being done in a 
future article. He hoped the Northern States did not mean 
to deny the Southern this security. It would hereafter be 
as desirable to the former, when the latter should become 
the most populous." He professed his jealousy for the pro 
ductions of the Southern, or Staple States, as he called 
them. He moved the following amendment : " Provided, 
that no tax, duty, or imposition shall be laid by the legisla 
ture of the United States on articles exported from any 
State." But the question was left to be decided later. The 
clause giving Congress the power to " emit bills on the credit 
of the United States," it was proposed to strike out. Colo 
nel Mason " had doubts on the subject. Congress, he 
thought, would not have the power, unless it were ex 
pressed. Though he had a mortal hatred to paper money, 
yet as he could not foresee all emergencies, he was unwilling 
to tie the hands of the legislature. He observed that the 
late war could not have been carried on, had such a prohibi 
tion existed." He was still "averse to tying the hands of 
the legislature altogether" he added later. " If there was 
no example in Europe, as just remarked [by Pierce Butler], 
it might be observed, on the other side, that there was none 
in which the government was restrained on this head." But 
the motion for striking out was agreed to. 1 In regard to the 
clause to appoint a treasurer by ballot, Mr. Read moved that 
this appointment should be left to the Executive. George 
Mason, in opposition to Mr. Read s motion, " desired it 
might be considered, to whom the money would belong; 
if to the people, the legislature, representing the people, 
ought to appoint the keepers of it." 2 In the clause " to de-

REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE MILITIA. 



clare the law and punishment of piracies and felonies," etc., 
Madison moved to strike out " and punishment." Colonel 
Mason doubted " the safety of it, considering the strict rule 
of construction in criminal cases. He doubted also the pro 
priety of taking the power in all these cases wholly from the 
States." It was moved to insert " declare " war instead of 
" make " war, and Colonel Mason was against giving the 
power of war to the Executive, as was suggested, " because 
not safely to be trusted with it ; or to the Senate, because 
not so constructed as to be entitled to it. He was for clog 
ging, rather than facilitating war; but for facilitating peace." 
He preferred " declare " to " make," and the motion was 
agreed to. 

On the 1 8th of August Madison submitted certain powers 
to be added to those of the general legislature, and George 
Mason introduced the subject of regulating the militia. He 
thought " such a power necessary to be given to the gen 
eral government. He hoped there would be no standing 
army in time of peace, unless it might be for a few garrisons. 
The militia ought, therefore, to be the more effectually pre 
pared for the public defence. Thirteen States will never 
concur in any one system, if the disciplining of the militia be 
left in their hands. If they will not give up the power over 
the whole, they probably will over a part, as a select militia." 
He moved to refer to the Committee of Detail, " a power 
to regulate the militia," as one of the prerogatives of the 
federal legislature. But he was led later to change his 
mind on this point. Mr. Rutledge wished to refer a clause 
to the committee, " that funds appropriated to public cred 
itors should not be diverted to other purposes." Colonel 
Mason said he " was much attached to the principle, but 
was afraid such a fetter might be dangerous in time of war. 
He suggested the necessity of preventing the danger of 
perpetual revenue, which must of necessity subvert the 
liberty of any country. If it be objected to on the princi 
ple of Mr. Rutledge s motion, that public credit may require

perpetual provisions, that case might be excepted, it being 
declared that in other cases no taxes should be laid for a 
longer term than . . . years. He considered the caution 
observed in Great Britain on this point as the palladium of 
public liberty." And Colonel Mason interposed later a 
motion that the committee prepare a clause for restraining 
perpetual revenue, which was agreed to nem. con. A grand 
committee was appointed to consider the necessity and ex 
pediency of the United States assuming all the State debts, 
and George Mason was the member from Virginia placed on 
this committee. Returning to the subject of the militia, 
Colonel Mason moved to give Congress power " to make 
laws for the regulation and discipline of the militia of the 
several States, reserving to the States the appointment of 
the officers." He considered " uniformity as necessary in 
the regulation of the militia throughout the Union." Mr. 
Ellsworth " was for going as far in submitting the militia to 
the general government, as might be necessary ; but thought 
the motion of Mr. Mason went too far." And Mr. Dickin 
son thought the States ought not to give up all power over 
the militia. Colonel Mason then alluded to his idea of a 
select militia. He * was led to think that would be, in fact, 
as much as the general government could advantageously be 
charged with. He was afraid of creating insuperable objec 
tions to the plan. He withdrew his original motion, and 
moved a power * to make laws for regulating and disciplining 
the militia, not exceeding one tenth part in any one year, 
and reserving the appointment of officers to the States. 
General Pinckney renewed Colonel Mason s original motion. 
In the course of the debate that followed, Mr. Sherman 
" took notice that the States might want their militia " 
for their own defence and for other purposes. Colonel 
Mason " thought there was great weight in the remarks 
of Mr. Sherman," and moved an exception to his motion, 
" of such part of the militia as might be required by the 
States for their own use," and the two motions were

QUALIFIED SOVEREIGNTY OF THE UNITED STATES. 159 



referred to the grand committee, 1 of which Mason was a 
member. 

George Mason about this time moved to enable Congress 
" to enact sumptuary laws." No government, he urged, 
" can be maintained unless the manners be made consonant 
to it. Such a discretionary power may do good, and can do 
no harm. A proper regulation of excises and of trade, 
may do a great deal ; but it is best to have an express pro 
vision. It was objected to sumptuary laws, that they were 
contrary to nature. This was a vulgar error. The love of 
distinction, it is true, is natural ; but the object of sump 
tuary laws is not to extinguish this principle, but to give it a 
proper direction." : The motion, however, was not carried. 

On the 2Oth the Convention discussed the second section 
of article seventh, concerning treason. Colonel Mason was 
in favor of pursuing the statute of Edward III. In the 
course of the discussion it was contended that there could 
be no treason against a particular State. Colonel Mason 
replied : " The United States will have a qualified sovereignty 
only. The individual States will retain a part of the sover 
eignty. An act may be treason against a particular State, 
which is not so against the United States. He cited the 
rebellion of Bacon in Virginia, as an illustration of the doc 
trine." The section was amended so as to read " Treason 
against the United States shall consist only in levying war 
against them, or in adhering to their enemies "; when Colo 
nel Mason moved to insert the words, " giving them aid and 
comfort," as restrictive of " adhering to their enemies," etc. 
The latter, he thought, " would be otherwise too indefinite." 
And this motion was agreed to. On the 2ist George Mason 
called for the twelfth section of article sixth, which had been 
postponed on the 1 5th. He " wished to know how the proposed 
amendment, as to money-bills, would be decided, before he 
agreed to any further points "; but the subject was again 
postponed, and the section of the seventh article on the 
power of taxing exports was debated. George Mason said : 

1 Ibid., p. 1364. * Ibid., p. 1369. 3 Ibid., p. 1373. 



l6o LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

44 If he were for reducing the States to mere corporations, as 
seemed to be the tendency of some arguments, he should be 
for subjecting their exports as well as imports to a power of 
general taxation. He went on a principle often advanced 
and in which he concurred, that a majority, when interested, 
will oppress the minority. This maxim had been verified 
by our own legislature [Virginia]. If we compare the States 
in this point of view, the eight Northern States have an 
interest different from the five Southern States ; and have, 
in one branch of the legislature, thirty-six votes, against 
twenty-nine, and in the other in the proportion of eight 
against five. The Southern States had therefore ground for 
their suspicions. The case of exports was not the same with 
that of imports. The latter were the same throughout the 
States ; the former very different. As to tobacco, other 
nations do raise it, and are capable of raising it, as well as 
Virginia, &c. The impolicy of taxing that article had been 
demonstrated by the experiment of Virginia." The power 
to tax exports was denied to the general government, and Vir 
ginia s vote against it was due to Mason, Randolph, and Blair. 
The clause allowing the importation of slaves called forth 
a heated debate. George Mason, in opposition to Mr. Sher 
man, of Connecticut, who was for leaving the clause as it 
stood, made a speech of some length. 44 This infernal traf 
fic," he said, " originated in the avarice of British merchants. 
The British Government constantly checked the attempts of 
Virginia to put a stop to it. The present question concerns 
not the importing States alone, but the whole Union. The 
evil of having slaves was experienced during the late war. 
Had slaves been treated as they might have been by the 
enemy, they would have proved dangerous instruments in 
their hands. But their folly dealt by the slaves as it did by 
the Tories. He mentioned the dangerous insurrection of 
the slaves in Greece and Sicily ; and the instructions given 
by Cromwell to the commissioners sent to Virginia, to arm 
the servants and slaves, in case other means of obtaining its 

1 Ibid., p. 1387. 



SPEECH AGAINST THE SLAVE TRADE. l6l 

submission should fail. Maryland and Virginia, he said, had 
already prohibited the importation of slaves expressly 
North Carolina had done the same in substance. All this 
would be in vain, if South Carolina and Georgia be at liberty 
to import. The Western people are already calling out for 
slaves for their new lands ; and will fill that country with 
slaves, if they can be got through South Carolina and Georgia. 
Slavery discourages arts and manufactures. The poor de 
spise labor when performed by slaves. They prevent the 
emigration of whites, who really enrich and strengthen a 
country. They produce the most pernicious effect on man 
ners. Every master of slaves is born a petty tyrant. They 
bring the judgment of heaven on a country. As nations 
cannot be rewarded or punished in the next world, they 
must be in this. By an inevitable chain of causes and effects, 
Providence punishes national sins by national calamities. 
He lamented that some of our Eastern brethren had, from a 
lust of gain, embarked in this nefarious traffic. As to the 
States being in possession of the right to import, this 
was the case with many other rights, now to be properly 
given up. He held it essential in every point of view, that 
the general government should have power to prevent the 
increase of slavery." 1 George Mason s attitude here must 
not be misunderstood. He was no abolitionist in the modern 
sense of the term. While he regretted the existence of 
slavery in the South and opposed the slave trade, at the 
same time he insisted that the rights of his section in this 
species of property should be protected, and he wished for a 
guarantee in the Constitution to insure it. He is himself an 
instance that the effect of slavery on manners was not essen 
tially deleterious. No doubt this was the case in individual 
instances, but, as a class, there were no nobler men nor more 
gracious women than the old slave-holding aristocracy of the 
South, from whence came the patriots and sages of 1776, 
and the generation that gave equally shining names to his 
tory in 1861. As the Virginia poet sings:

Who shall blame the social order 

Which gave us men as great as these ? 
Who condemn the soil of th forest 
Which brings forth gigantic trees ? " 

After some further debate on this clause relating to slav 
ery, Gouverneur Morris proposed that the whole subject be 
committed, including the clauses regarding taxes on exports 
and a navigation act. " These things may form a bargain 
among the Northern and Southern States" said Morris. This 
was the beginning of the compact so reprobated by Colonel 
Mason, which altered the Constitution, as he declared, fun 
damentally, and made it impossible for him to subscribe to it. 
The committee was appointed, a grand committee, including 
one member from each State, and Madison, as might be 
expected, was the choice from Virginia. 

While the seventh article was under consideration some 
what later, it was moved to add, as an additional power to be 
given to the general legislature, a negative on all the laws 
of the several States interfering with the interests of the 
Union, provided two thirds of each House assent to the 
same. Colonel Mason " wished to know how the power was 
to be exercised. Are all laws whatever to be brought up ? 
Is no road nor bridge to be established without the sanction 
of the general legislature ? Is this to sit constantly in order 
to receive and revise the State laws? He did not mean by 
the remarks, to condemn the expedient ; but he was appre 
hensive that great objections would lie against it." The 
grand committee, to whom the subject had been referred, had 
given to the United States power to assume the several 
State debts, making their report on the 2ist, and on the 25th 
the Convention modified this decision, simply affirming " that 
the engagements of the Confederation should be equally 
valid against the United States under this Constitution." 
Colonel Mason "objected to the term shall fulfil the en 
gagements and discharge the debts, &c., as too strong. It 
may be impossible to comply with it. The creditors should

AN OBNOXIOUS BARGAIN CONSUMMATED. 163 



be kept in the same plight. They will in one respect be 
necessarily and properly in a better. The government will 
be more able to pay them. The use of the term shall will 
beget speculations, and increase the pestilential practice of 
stock-jobbing. There was a great distinction between origi 
nal creditors and those who purchased fraudulently of the 
ignorant and distressed. He did not mean to include those 
who have bought stock in the open market. He was sensible 
of the difficulty of drawing the line in this case, but he did not 
wish to preclude the attempt. Even fair purchasers, at four, 
five, six, eight for one, did not stand on the same footing 
with the first holders, supposing them not to be blamable. 
The interest they received, even in paper, is equal to their 
purchase money. What he particularly wished was, to leave 
the door open for buying up the securities, which he thought 
would be precluded by the term * shall as requiring nominal 
payment, and which was not inconsistent with his ideas of 
public faith. He was afraid, also, the word shall might ex 
tend to all the old continental paper." On this same day 
the report of the committee of eleven delivered into the 
Convention the twenty-fourth, allowing the importation of 
" such persons as the several States now existing, shall think 
proper to admit " etc., was discussed. Gouverneur Morris was 
for making this clause read " the importation of slaves into 
North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia shall not be 
prohibited," etc. George Mason was not " against using the 
term * slaves, but against naming North Carolina, South 
Carolina and Georgia, lest it should give offence to the 
people of those States. 2 The year 1800 was fixed in the 
report as the term when the importation of slaves should 
cease. This was changed to 1808. Objections were 
made by Sherman to the tax on slaves as acknowledging 
them to be property, to which Colonel Mason replied, " not 
to tax, will be equivalent to a bounty on, the importation of 
slaves." Gouverneur Morris remarked, that as the clause 
stood it implied that the legislature might tax freemen im-

164 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

ported ; to which Colonel Mason replied : " The provision, 
as it stands, was necessary for the case of convicts, in order 
to prevent the introduction of them." It was finally amended 
so as to read " importation " only, instead of " migration 
and importation," as in the report of the committee. 1 

Certain propositions made in regard to regulating trade 
were referred to a grand committee, and George Mason was 
the member selected for Virginia, the choice being made as 
usual by ballot. 3 Colonel Mason and Mr. Madison moved 
to add to the oath to be taken by the supreme executive 
" and will, to the best of my judgment and power, preserve, 
protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States," 
which amendment passed. Article eleven, section second, 
having reference to the salaries of the judges, was consid 
ered, and it was urged to reinstate the words " increased or," 
before the word " diminished." Colonel Mason contended 
strenuously for the motion. " There was no weight," he said, 
" in the argument drawn from changes in the value of the 
metals, because this might be provided for by an increase of 
salaries, so made as not to affect persons in office ; and this 
was the only argument on which much stress seemed to have 
been laid." 3 The amendment, however, was not made. A 
proposition followed, to prohibit the States from interfering 
in private contracts, and Mr. Madison conceived " that a 
negative on the State laws could alone secure the effect." 
George Mason replied : " This is carrying the restraint too 
far. Cases will happen that cannot be foreseen where some 
kind of interference will be proper and essential. He men 
tioned the case of limiting the period for bringing actions 
on open account that of bonds after a certain lapse of time 
asking whether it was proper to tie the hands of the 
States from making provision in such cases." A motion 
was made restricting the power of the States, in the words, 
" nor pass bills of attainder, nor retrospective laws," which 
received the assent of the Convention, Virginia, however,

2 Ibid., p. 1432. * Ibid., p. 1443. 



RESTRICTIONS ON THE POWERS OF THE STATES. 165 



voting against it. Madison then moved to insert " nor lay 
embargoes." Colonel Mason thought " the amendment 
would be not only improper but dangerous, as the general 
legislature would not sit constantly, and therefore could not 
interpose at the necessary moments. He enforced his ob 
jection by appealing to the necessity of sudden embargoes, 
during the war, to prevent exports, particularly in the case of 
a blockade." J The motion was lost. Madison moved next 
that the prohibition, " nor lay imposts or duties on imports," 
be transferred from article thirteen, where the consent of 
the general legislature may license the act, to article twelve, 
which would make the prohibition absolute. To this George 
Mason observed, " that particular States might wish to 
encourage, by impost duties, certain manufactures, for 
which they enjoyed natural advantages, as Virginia the 
manufacture of hemp, &c." 2 This motion was lost ; but 
coming to article thirteen it was moved to insert after the 
word "imports" the words "or exports," which passed by a 
majority of one only, all the Southern States except North 
Carolina being in the negative. 

On the 2Qth of August the Convention took up the im 
portant section of article seven relating to navigation acts, 
which the committee of eleven had, in accordance with the 
compromise before mentioned, reported to be struck out. 
This provision required the assent of two thirds of the mem 
bers present in each House to pass a navigation act. Mr. 
Pinckney moved to postpone the report in favor of the 
following proposition : " That no act of the legislature for 
the purpose of regulating the commerce of the United 
States with foreign powers, among the several States, shall 
be passed without the assent of two thirds of the members 
of each House." Colonel Mason spoke with much feeling 
on the subject : 

" If the government is to be lasting it must be founded in the 
confidence and affections of the people ; and must be so con- 

1 Ibid., p. 1444. 2 Ibid., p. 1445. 



1 66 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

structed as to obtain these. The majority will be governed by 
their interests. The Southern States are the minority in both 
Houses. Is it to be expected that they will deliver themselves 
bound, hand and foot, to the Eastern States, and enable them to 
exclaim, in the words of Cromwell, on a certain occasion the 
Lord hath delivered them into our hands ?" 1 

The question to postpone was lost, South Carolina joining 
with the Northern States in their unanimous vote against 
it. The report striking out section sixth was agreed to, and 
thus the die was cast and the way made easy for that sec 
tional legislation which was to lead at length to the Nullifi 
cation crisis, and was to be one of the causes of the war 
between the States. 

In considering article seventeen relating to the admission 
of new States, Gouverneur Morris made a fresh motion, put 
ting restrictions on them, and Madison and Mason both 
opposed him. Colonel Mason said : " If it were possible by 
just means to prevent emigration to the western country, 
it might be good policy. But go the people will, as they 
find it for their interest ; and the best policy is to treat 
them with that equality which will make them friends not 
enemies." 2 On the question of filling the blank in article 
twenty-one naming the number of States sufficient for rati 
fying the Constitution, thirteen, ten, nine, and eight were all 
suggested. George Mason was for " preserving ideas familiar 
to the people. Nine States had been required in all great 
cases under the Confederation, and that number was on that 
account preferable." 3 Article twenty-second was taken up : 
" This Constitution shall be laid before the United States in 
Congress assembled, for their approbation, etc.," and it was 
moved by Mr. Gerry to postpone it. George Mason " sec 
onded the motion, declaring that he would sooner chop off 
his right hand, than put it to the Constitution as it now 
stands. He wished to see some points, not yet decided, 
brought to a decision, before being compelled to give a final 
opinion on this article. Should these points be improperly 

1 Ibid., p. 1453. - Ibid., p. 1457. " Ibid., p. 1473. 



COLONEL MASON S EMPHATIC DISAPPROBATION. l6/ 



settled, his wish would then be to bring the whole subject 
before another general convention." Gouverneur Morris 
on the 3d of September, moved to amend the report con 
cerning the respect to be paid acts, records, etc., of one State 
in other States so as to read, " and the legislature shall, by 
general laws, prescribe the manner in which such acts, rec 
ords, and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect thereof," 
instead of " and the effect which judgments obtained in one 
State shall have in another." Colonel Mason favored the 
motion, particularly if the " effect " was to be restrained to 
judgments and judicial proceedings. 2 

Certain parts of the Constitution had been referred to a 
grand committee on the 3 1st of August, Madison being the 
delegate from Virginia on the committee, and their report 
was made the 4th of September. Much of it referred to the 
Executive, the manner of his election, etc. He was to be 
balloted for by electors, not chosen by the legislature, was to 
serve for four years instead of seven, but in case more than 
one candidate had a majority of votes, then the Senate was 
to choose by ballot one of these candidates for President. 
Colonel Mason " confessed that the plan of the committee 
had removed some capital objections, particularly the danger 
of cabal and corruption. It was liable, however, to this 
strong objection, that nineteen times in twenty the President 
would be chosen by the Senate, an improper body for the 
purpose." 3 The question was debated the following day, 
when George Mason spoke as follows. He " admitted that 
there were objections to an appointment by the legislature, 
as originally planned. He had not yet made up his mind, 
but would state his objections to the mode proposed by the 
committee. First, it puts the appointment in fact into the 
hands of the Senate, as it will rarely happen that a majority 
of the whole vote will fall on any one candidate ; and as the 
existing President will always be one of the five highest, his 
reappointment will of course depend on the Senate. Sec 
ondly, considering the powers of the President and those of 

1 Ibid., p. 1475. 9 Ibid., p. 1480. 3 Ibid., p. 1490. 



1 68 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

the Senate, if a coalition should be established between 
these two branches, they will be able to subvert the Con 
stitution. The great objection with him \vould be removed 
by depriving the Senate of the eventual election." He 
accordingly moved to strike out the words " if such number 
be a majority of that of the electors." This would make 
the person having the highest number of votes, though not 
a majority, President. Gouverneur Morris thought the 
point of no great consequence, and that it was probable 
that a majority of votes would fall on the same man. Colo 
nel Mason replied : " Those who think there is no danger of 
there not being a majority for the same person in the first 
instance, ought to give up the point to those who think oth 
erwise." 2 George Mason s motion was lost by a large 
majority. Then, after several other propositions made by 
different members, Colonel Mason moved to strike out the 
word " five " and insert the word u three," as the highest 
candidates for the Senate to choose from, which motion was 
also lost. He continued his objections : " As the mode of 
appointment is now regulated, he could not forbear express 
ing his opinion that it is utterly inadmissible. He would 
prefer the government of Prussia to one which will put all 
power into the hands of seven or eight men, and fix an 
aristocracy worse than absolute monarchy." This question 
coming up again the following day, it was proposed that an 
eventual choice should be made by the House in conjunction 
with the Senate, and finally that the House of Representa 
tives be substituted for the Senate. Colonel Mason " liked 
the latter mode best as lessening the aristocratic influence of 
the Senate," and the motion was agreed to by an almost 
unanimous vote. 4 Other amendments were made which 
met with George Mason s approval, and the clause received 
its final form. 

In considering the section, " the Vice-President shall be 
ex-officio president of the Senate," Colonel Mason spoke at 

1 Ibid., p. 1499. :&lt; Ibid., p. 1503.

DESIRES A PRIVY COUNCIL FOR THE PRESIDENT. 169 

some length. He 4&lt; thought the office of Vice-President an 
encroachment on the rights of the Senate, and that it mixed 
too much the legislative and the executive, which, as well as 
the judiciary department, ought to be kept as separate as 
possible. He took occasion to express his dislike of any 
reference whatever, of the power to make appointments, to 
either branch of the legislature. On the other hand, he was 
averse to vest so dangerous a power in the President alone. 
As a method for avoiding both, he suggested that a privy 
council, of six members, to the President, should be estab 
lished, to be chosen for six years by the Senate, two out of 
the Eastern, two out of the Middle, and two out of the 
Southern quarters of the Union ; and to go out in rota 
tion, two every second year, the concurrence of the Senate 
to be required only in the appointment of ambassadors, and 
in making treaties, which are more of a legislative nature. 
This would prevent the constant sitting of the Senate, which 
he thought dangerous, as well as keep the departments 
separate and distinct. It would also save the expense of 
constant sessions of the Senate. He had, he said, always 
considered the Senate as too unwieldy and expensive for 
appointing officers, especially the smallest, such as tide- 
waiters, &c. He had not reduced his idea to writing, but it 
could be easily done, if it should be found acceptable." 
This idea of a council was supported by Mr. Wilson, but 
opposed by Mr. King. Colonel Mason then said, " that in 
rejecting a council to the President we were about to try an 
experiment on which the most despotic governments had 
never ventured. The Grand Seignior himself had his divan. 
He moved to postpone the consideration of the clause 
[" and may require the opinion in writing of the principal 
officer in each of the Executive Departments, upon any sub 
ject relating to the duties of their respective offices,"] in 
order to take up the following : That it be an instruction 
to the Committee of the States to prepare a clause or 
clauses for establishing an Executive Council, as a Coun-

cil of State, for the President of the United States, to con 
sist of six members, two of which from the Eastern, two 
from the Middle, and two from the Southern States, with a 
rotation and duration of office similar to those of the Senate: 
such Council to be appointed by the Legislature or by the 
Senate. 

This motion, seconded by Dr. Franklin and approved of 
by Madison and others, was rejected by the Convention. 

The Constitution on the 8th of September was referred to 
a committee of five to revise the style. Johnson, Hamilton, 
Morris, Madison, and King composed this committee, and 
the final draft of the Constitution was the work of Gouv- 
erneur Morris. The clause referring to the Senate the trial 
of impeachments against the President was taken up by the 
Convention on the 8th, and George Mason inquired : 

" Why is the provision restrained to treason and bribery only ? 
Treason, as denned in the Constitution, will not reach many great 
and dangerous offences. Hastings is not guilty of treason. At 
tempts to subvert the Constitution may not be treason, as above 
denned. As bills of attainder, which have saved the British 
constitution, are forbidden, it is the more necessary to extend the 
power of impeachments." 

He moved to add, after " bribery," " or maladministra 
tion." Colonel Mason was seconded by Mr. Gerry, but 
Madison objecting to the vagueness of the term " mal 
administration," he withdrew it and substituted " other high 
crimes and misdemeanours " [against the State]. The ques 
tion then passed in the affirmative. 2 The word " State " 
was afterwards struck out and " United States " unani 
mously inserted, to prevent ambiguity. But these words 
" United States " were finally struck out by the committee 
on style. On the loth Edmund Randolph stated at some 
length his objections to the Constitution as now formulated. 
He made a motion to submit the system to the Congress, 
thence to the State legislatures and conventions, the pro-

WISHES TO HAVE A BILL OF RIGHTS. \J\ 



cess to close with another general convention, with power 
to adopt or reject amendments proposed by the State con 
ventions. Colonel Mason " urged and obtained that the 
motion should lie on the table for a day or two, to see what 
steps might be taken with regard to the parts of the system 
objected to by Mr. Randolph." On the I2ththe Committee 
of Style and Arrangement reported the Constitution, and it 
was moved to reconsider the clause requiring three fourths 
of each House to overrule the negative of the President, and 
insert two thirds. Gouverneur Morris said the difference in 
the two proportions amounted " in one House to two mem 
bers only ; and in the other to not more than five/ George 
Mason said he " had always considered this as one of the 
most exceptionable parts of the system. As to the numeri 
cal argument of Mr. Gouverneur Morris, little arithmetic was 
necessary to understand that three fourths was more than 
two thirds, whatever the numbers of the legislature might 
be. The example [given by Morris and Hamilton] of New 
York depended on the real merits of the laws. The gentle 
men citing it had no doubt given their own opinions. But 
perhaps there were others of opposite opinions who could 
equally paint the abuses on the other side. His leading 
view was to guard against too great -an impediment to the 
repeal of laws." The amendment was made, Virginia s 
vote counting in the negative, however, as Mason and 
Randolph were opposed by Washington, Blair, and Madi 
son. It was then observed that no provision was made for 
juries in civil cases, to which Mr. Gorham replied : " It is 
not possible to discriminate equity cases from those in which 
juries are proper." Colonel Mason said he " perceived the 
difficulty mentioned by Mr. Gorham. The jury cases can 
not be specified. A general principle laid down, on this 
and some other points, would be sufficient. He wished the 
plan had been prefaced with a Bill of Rights, and would 
second a motion if made for the purpose. It would give 
great quiet to the people ; and with the aid of the State

1^2 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASOA\ 

Declarations, a bill might be prepared in a few hours." Mr. 
Gerry concurred in the idea, and moved for a committee to 
prepare a Bill of Rights, George Mason seconding the motion. 
Mr. Sherman thought it was not required, as the State 
Declarations of Rights were not repealed by this Constitution. 
Colonel Mason replied : " The laws of the United States 
are to be paramount to State Bills of Rights." On the 
question for a committee to prepare a Bill of Rights, five 
States voted in the affirmative and the five Southern States 
in the negative. Massachusetts was absent. 1 Virginia s vote 
probably went as before, Washington, Blair, and Madison 
against Mason and Randolph. 

The clause relating to exports was reconsidered at the 
instance of Colonel Mason, who urged " that the restrictions 
on the States would prevent the incidental duties necessary 
for the inspection and safe-keeping of their produce, and be 
ruinous to the Staple States, as he called the five Southern 
States. He moved as follows : k&lt; Provided nothing herein 
contained shall be construed to restrain any State from lay 
ing duties upon exports for the sole purpose of defraying 
the charges of inspecting, packing, storing, and indemnify 
ing the losses in keeping the commodities in the care of 
public officers, before exportation." In answer to a remark 
which he anticipated to wit, that the States could provide 
for these expenses by a tax in some other way, he stated 
the inconvenience of requiring the planters to pay a tax 
before the actual delivery for exportation. Mr. Madison 
seconded the motion, but the Convention soon after ad 
journed without further action in the matter. The next day 
George Mason, who was the first to address the Convention, 
said he " had moved without success for a power to make 
sumptuary regulations. He had not yet lost sight of his 
object. After descanting on the extravagance of our man 
ners, the excessive consumption of foreign superfluities, and 
the necessity of restricting it, as well with economical as 
republican views, he moved that a committee be appointed 

1 Ibid,, p. 1566. 



AGAINST VESTING FURTHER POWERS IN CONGRESS. 173 

to report articles of association for encouraging, by the 
advice, the influence, and the example of the members of 
the Convention, economy, frugality, and American manu 
factures." The motion was seconded and without debate 
agreed to, and a committee of five appointed, Colonel 
Mason at the head of it. But no report, it seems, was 
ever made by this committee. George Mason renewed at 
this time his proposition of the day before " on the subject 
of inspection laws, with an additional clause giving to Con 
gress a control over them in case of abuse as follows : 
Provided, that no State shall be restrained from imposing 
the usual duties on produce exported from such State, for 
the sole purpose of defraying the charges of inspecting, 
packing, storing, and indemnifying the losses on such 
produce, while in the custody of public officers; but all 
such regulations shall, in case of abuse, be subject to the 
revision and control of Congress. There was no debate, 
and the question passed in the affirmative. 1 

In considering the section, " Each House shall keep a 
journal of its proceedings, and from time to time publish 
the same, excepting such parts as may in their judgment 
require secrecy," Colonel Mason and Mr. Gerry moved to 
insert after the word " parts " the words " of the proceedings 
of the Senate," so as to require publication of all the pro 
ceedings of the House of Representatives. But the question 
passed in the negative. 2 Dr. Franklin moved to add to the 
powers vested in Congress " to provide for cutting canals 
where deemed necessary." Madison wished to enlarge the 
motion, "to grant charters of incorporation, &c." Colonel 
Mason was for " limiting the power to the single case of 
canals. He was afraid of monopolies of every sort, which 
he did not think were by any means already implied by the 
Constitution, as supposed by Mr. Wilson. " : The motion, 
however, limiting the power to the case of canals, was lost. 
Colonel Mason, " being sensible that an absolute prohibition 
of standing armies in time of peace might be unsafe, and 

1 Ibid., p. 1569. 2 Ibid., p. 1573. 3 Ibid., p. 1577. 



T74 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

wishing at the same time to insert something pointing out 
and guarding against the danger of them, moved to preface 
the clause (Art. I., Sect. 8), to provide for organizing, arm 
ing, and disciplining the militia, &c., with the words * and 
that the liberties of the people may be better secured 
against the danger of standing armies in time of peace. 
Both Randolph and Madison were in favor of the motion, 
but only two States, Virginia and Georgia, voted for it. 
George Mason then moved to strike out from the clause 
(Art. I., Sect. 9) " no bill of attainder, nor any ex post facto 
law, shall be passed," the words " nor any ex post facto 
law." He " thought it not sufficiently clear that the prohi 
bition meant by this phrase was limited to cases of a criminal 
nature ; and no legislature ever did or can altogether avoid 
them in civil cases." 2 All the States opposed. "the motion, 
however. In Article I., Section 9, it was moved by Colo 
nel Mason to insert the words " or enumeration " after, as 
explanatory of, " census." He also moved a clause requiring 
" that an account of the public expenditures should be annu 
ally published." The motion was altered by striking out 
" annually " and inserting " from time to time," and passed 
in this form. 3 The subject of inspection laws was again 
taken up, and, in consequence of the proviso moved by 
George Mason, and agreed to by the Convention on the 
1 3th, this part of the section was laid aside in favor of the 
form now in the Constitution (Art. I., Sect. 10). But a 
motion to strike out the last words of the paragraph, " and 
all such laws shall be subject to the revision and control of 
the Congress," passed in the negative. All the States then 
agreed to the substitute except Virginia. 4 Messrs. Mc- 
Henry and Carroll, of Maryland, moved that " no State 
shall be restrained from laying duties of tonnage for the 
purpose of clearing harbours and erecting light-houses." 
Colonel Mason, in support of this motion, " explained and 
urged the situation of the Chesapeake, which peculiarly

3 Ibid., p. 1579. 4 Ibid., p. 1584. 



HIS MOTION IN REGARD TO NAVIGATION ACTS. 



required expenses of this sort." But in place of this right 
reserved the motion passed " that no State shall lay any 
duty on tonnage without the consent of Congress." On 
the subject of the power of the Executive to grant reprieves 
and pardons, Edmund Randolph moved to except " cases 
of treason," and Colonel Mason supported the motion. 
Madison thought the Senate should share this power with 
the President, if it was to be given to the latter. Colonel 
Mason replied " that the Senate has already too much 
power. There can be no danger of too much lenity in 
legislative pardons, as the Senate must concur ; and the 
President moreover can require two thirds of both Houses." 2 

The motion received the support of only two States, Vir 
ginia and Georgia. George Mason thought the plan of 
amending the Constitution " exceptionable and dangerous. 
As the proposing of amendments is in both the modes 
to depend, in the first immediately, and in the second 
ultimately, on Congress, no amendments of the proper kind 
would ever be obtained by the people, if the government 
should become oppressive, as he verily believed would be 
the case." 3 

Returning for the last time to a subject which he considered 
of vital importance, Colonel Mason expressed " his discontent 
at the power given to Congress, by a bare majority to pass 
navigation acts, which he said would not only enhance the 
freight, a consequence he did not so much regard, but would 
enable a few rich merchants in Philadelphia, New York and 
Boston, to monopolize the staples of the Southern States, 
and reduce their value perhaps fifty per cent." He then 
moved " that no law in the nature of a navigation act be 
passed before the year 1808, without the consent of two 
thirds of each branch of the Legislature." Maryland, Vir 
ginia, and Georgia were the only States that voted in the affirm 
ative on this motion. North Carolina was absent, and South 
Carolina apparently regarded herself as pledged to Northern

interests here. Edmund Randolph animadverted on the in 
definite and dangerous power given by the Constitution to 
Congress, and he made a motion " that amendments to the 
plan might be offered by the State conventions, which should 
be submitted to, and finally decided on by, another general 
convention." George Mason seconded the motion, and fol 
lowed Randoph in strictures " on the dangerous power and 
structure of the government, concluding that it would end 
either in monarchy, or a tyrannical aristocracy ; which, he 
was in doubt, but one or other, he was sure. This Constitu 
tion had been formed without the knowledge or idea of the 
people. A second convention will know more of the sense 
of the people, and be able to provide a system more conso 
nant to it. It was improper to say to the people, Take this 
or nothing. As the Constitution now stands, he could 
neither give it his support or vote in Virginia; and he could 
not sign here what he could not support there. With the 
expedient of another convention, as proposed, he could 
sign." l This was Colonel Mason s last utterance in the 
Federal Convention. He was followed by Elbridge Gerry, 
who stated briefly his objections to the proposed system. 
Then, on the proposition of Edmund Randolph for a second 
convention, all the States voted in the negative. This was 
on Saturday, the I5th of September. On Monday, the i/th, 
the engrossed Constitution was read and signed by all the 
members present except George Mason, Edmund Randolph, 
and Elbridge Gerry. 

George Mason told Jefferson that the Constitution as 
agreed to only a fortnight before met with his approval. It 
was, however, somewhat earlier that the changes were made 
which so altered its character as to render it, in .Mason s 
opinion, no longer a safe charter of government. Luther 
Martin, in answering an assertion of one of his political 
adversaries, in 1788, that he had cautioned certain members 
of the Convention to be on their guard against the wiles of 
Elbridge Gerry, " for that he and Mason held private meet-

PRIVATE MEETINGS OF STATES-RIGHTS MEMBERS. I// 

ings, where the plans were concerted to aggrandize, at the 
expense of the small States, Old Massachusetts and the 
Ancient Dominion/ " gives an account of the efforts of the 
States-rights party to restore the Constitution to the form 
first " agreed to." " Some time in the month of August," 
he says, " a number of members who considered the system, 
as then under consideration, and likely to be adopted, ex 
tremely exceptionable, and of a tendency to destroy the 
rights and liberties of the United States, thought it advisa 
ble to meet together in the evenings, in order to have a com 
munication of sentiments, and to concert a plan of conven 
tional opposition to, and amendment of, that system, so as, 
if possible, to render it less dangerous. Mr. Gerry was the 
first who proposed this measure to me, and that before any 
meeting had taken place, and wished we might assemble at 
my lodgings ; but not having a room convenient we fixed 
upon another place. There Mr. Gerry and Mr. Mason did 
hold meetings ; but with them also met the delegates from 
New Jersey and Connecticut, a part of the delegation from 
Delaware, an honorable member from South Carolina, [Charles 
Pinckney?] one other from Georgia and myself. Those were 
the only private meetings that ever I knew or heard to be 
held by Mr. Gerry and Mr. Mason meetings at which I my 
self attended until I left the Convention and of which the 
sole object was not to aggrandize the great at the expense of 
the small, but to protect and preserve, if possible, the ex 
istence and essential rights of all the States, and the liberty 
and freedom of their citizens." 

Hoping against hope and vigilant to the end, Colonel 
Mason is to be seen at his post in the last weeks of the Con 
vention, striving to bring about alterations of more or less 
signficance and value. The vote of the 2Qth of August had 
been a great disappointment to him, but he still sought to 
reverse its decision. Among his manuscripts is to be found 
a paper showing the points of the Constitution to which he

Luther Martin. 

Vol. II 12 



1/8 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

took exception and the amendments designed by him at this 
time. Opposite most of these notes, of which there are 
twenty in all, George Mason has marked in the margin 
" agreed " or " refused," as the case might be. One of them, 
endorsed as " not proposed," is as follows : 

" Sect. 2 Art. 4. The citizens of one State having an estate 
in another, have not secured to them the right of removing their 
property as in the Fourth Article of the Confederation. Amend 
by adding the following clause : And every citizen having an 
estate in two or more States shall have a right to remove his 
property from one State to another." 

George Mason s reference to Article V fixes the date of the 
manuscript to some extent. He says : 

" By this article Congress only have the power of proposing 
amendments at any future time to this Constitution, and should 
it prove ever so oppressive the whole people of America can t 
make, or even propose alterations to it ; a doctrine utterly sub 
versive of the fundamental principles of the rights and liberties 
of the people." 

Here Colonel Mason s watchfulness was of great service 
in detecting and bringing to light a device of Gouverneur 
Morris to prevent the States from having the power to pro 
pose amendments. George Mason gave an account of the 
circumstance to Jefferson, who thus reports it : 

" One morning Gouverneur Morris moved an instrument for 
certain alterations (not one half the members yet come in). In 
a hurry and without understanding, it was agreed to. The com 
mittee [on style] reported so that Congress should have the 
exclusive power of proposing amendments. George Mason 
observed it on the report and opposed it. King denied the con 
struction. Mason demonstrated it, and asked the committee by 
what authority they had varied what had been agreed. Gouv 
erneur Morris then imprudently got up and said, By authority of 
the Convention, and produced the blind instruction before men- 



FR US TRA riON OF A N A D VERSA R Y S SCHEME. 1 79 

tioned, which was unknown by one half the house, and not till 
then understood by the other. They then restored it as it 
originally stood/ l 

Morris was not scrupulous, as his own admissions show, 
in his desire to secure a centralized government. He tells 
how, in his capacity of draftsman for the committee on style, 
he sought by the wording of another portion of the Constitu 
tion, the article on the judiciary, to give it a more decided bias 
in the desired direction. 2 Mason and Morris were types of op 
posing political views, and it is noticeable in the debates 
of the Convention how often they engaged one another in 
combat. They were strongly contrasted in character also, 
which made the antagonism more complete. 

George Mason s last and cardinal amendment is given in 
this manuscript as originally proposed by him : 

" No law in the nature of a Navigation Act shall be 
passed without the assent of two thirds of the members 
present in each House." 

In another hand, the qualifying phrase is inserted which 
it was believed might make it more acceptable " before the 
year 1808." : Among George Mason s manuscripts, relating 
to the period of the Federal Convention, is a draft of a con 
stitution in the handwriting of Edmund Randolph. It is 
discussed at length by Mr. Moncure D. Conway in his 
biography of Randolph. 4 This paper, full of details, and 
with marginal notes by John Rutledge, was evidently used 
in one of the Convention committees. Other manuscripts, 
chips preserved by George Mason from the Convention 
workshop, are a fragment of a speech of his, and some 
suggestions, in an unknown hand, on the subject of the 
judiciary. 5

CHAPTER VI. 

LAST YEAR IN THE VIRGINIA ASSEMBLY. 

1787-1788. 
Washington notes in his journal September 17, 1787 : 

" Met in Convention, when the Constitution received the unani 
mous assent of eleven States, and of Col. Hamilton from New 
York, the only delegate from thence in Convention, and was sub 
scribed to by every member present, except Governor Randolph 
and Colonel Mason from Virginia, and Mr. Gerry from Massa 
chusetts. The business being thus closed the members adjourned 
to the City Tavern, dined together, and took a cordial leave of 
each other. After which I returned to my lodgings, did some 
business with and received the papers from the Secretary of the 
Convention, and retired to meditate on the momentous work, 
which had been executed, after not less than five, for a large part 
of the time six, and sometimes seven hours sitting every day 
(except Sundays and the ten days adjournment to give a commit 
tee an opportunity and time to arrange the business) for more 
than four months." 

We have no record of George Mason s last day in the 
Convention. But his meditations upon the " momentous 
work " there executed were, doubtless, of a very different 
nature from Washington s. He went home, perhaps, in 
company with his* neighbor of " Mount Vernon," and dis 
cussed by the way the Constitution and its shortcomings. 
Alexandria is said to have been strongly in favor of the new 

"Writings of Washington," Sparks, vol. ix. (Appendix), p. 541.

government. And such was certainly the bias of a Phila 
delphia paper, which published in its editorial columns a 
remarkable story purporting to be a veracious account of 
George Mason s reception in Alexandria on his return from 
the Convention. " We hear from Alexandria," says this 
Baron Munchausen, " that on the arrival of Mr. Mason (one 
of the delegates in Convention) at Alexandria, he was waited 
on by the Mayor and Corporation of that town, who told 
him, they were not come to return him their thanks for his 
conduct in refusing to sign the Federal Constitution, but to 
express their abhorrence to it, and to advise him to withdraw 
from that town within an hour, for they could not answer 
for his personal safety from an enraged populace should he 
exceed that time." George Mason was too much respected 
by the mayor and corporation of Alexandria to have received 
from them any such treatment as is here described, even had 
the town been so foolish as to resent the action of their rep 
resentative, which is by no means proved. And as neither 
Washington nor George Mason refer to any such incident, 
in their letters, it may well be dismissed as completely ficti 
tious. Edmund Randolph, too, would most likely have 
reported it to Madison, if his " dissenting colleague " had 
met with such an experience, when he wrote from Bowling 
Green, September 3oth : 

" In Alexandria the inhabitants are enthusiastic [/. e. in favor 
of the Constitution], and instructions to force my dissenting col 
league to assent to a convention are on the anvil. I wrote to 
him yesterday suggesting to him this expedient : to urge the 
calling of a convention as the first act of the Assembly : if they 
should wish amendments let them be stated and forwarded to the 
States. Before the meeting of the convention an answer may be 
obtained. If the proposed amendments be rejected, let the con 
stitution immediately operate : if approved by nine States, let the 
assent of our convention be given under the exceptions of the 
points amended. This will, I believe, blunt the opposition, which 
will be formidable, if they must take altogether or reject." 2

1 82 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE AIASON. 

This letter of Edmund Randolph to George Mason has 
been lost, and it is not very clear, partly owing to the fact 
that the sentence is not punctuated at all in the manuscript, 
what the Governor meant, as he described his scheme to 
Madison. On the subject of calling a convention, George 
Mason did not need any prompting, either from his Alex 
andria constituents or from Edmund Randolph. He had 
prepared, in the last days of the Convention, his " Objec 
tions to the Constitution." These he enclosed to Washing 
ton, in a letter dated October /th. He writes : 

" I take the liberty to enclose to you my objections, to the new 
constitution of government, which a little moderation and tem 
per at the latter end of the Convention might have removed. I 
am, however, most decidedly of opinion, that it ought to be sub 
mitted to the people for that special purpose, and should any 
attempt be made to prevent the calling of such a Convention here, 
such a measure shall have every opposition in my power to give 
it. You will readily observe that my objections are not numer 
ous (the greater part of the enclosed paper containing reasonings 
upon the probable effects of the exceptionable parts), though in 
my mind some of them are capital ones." 

Colonel Mason in his letter then leaves politics for agri 
culture, and tells his correspondent of the failure of some of 
his crops, and that Dr. Williamson and Colonel Davie, of 
North Carolina, whom he had met at the Convention, had 
shown him letters mentioning large crops of corn in their 
State. He proposes to supply himself there, and will write 
to Dr. Williamson at Edenton for this purpose. And George 
Mason offers to make a contract for Washington also, should 
the latter desire it. 1 

George Mason wrote out his objections to the Constitution 
before leaving the Convention, apparently, as they are found 
on the edition of the Constitution printed for the benefit of 
the members, and given to them September I3th. This was 
the " Report " of the " Committee on Style and Arrange- 

1 Washington MSS., State Department. 



MASON S "OBJECTIONS TO THE CONSTITUTION." 183 

ment." George Mason s copy, 1 which is among the few that 
have been preserved, is full of interlineations and marginal 
notes, having been used, no doubt, in Committee of the 
Whole. The " Objections," as they appeared afterwards in 
pamphlet form, were somewhat expanded, and there were 
changes in the style here and there. 2 They were not a great 
many, as George Mason told Washington, but they covered 
the whole ground, and were dwelt upon fully in the debates 
of the Virginia Convention some months later. In the 
" Address of the Sixteen Seceding Members of the Legisla 
ture of Pennsylvania," September 2Qth, 3 as Washington wrote 
Madison, George Mason s objections are detailed, and no 
doubt he was in communication with the Antifederalists of 
Pennsylvania and gave them the benefit of his views. His 
objections were circulated among his friends in manuscript 
before they appeared in print, and Madison wrote a reply to 
them in a letter to Washington, October i8th. 4 It is evident 
they excited a great deal of interest and no little alarm 
among the Federalists, though Madison affected to think 
them of small importance. They were published in Rich 
mond, " Addressed to the Citizens of Virginia," 5 probably 
in November or December, 1787, and it is said they were 
also published in Boston, " mutilated of that which pointed 
at the regulation of commerce." An answer to them ap 
peared in the Massachusetts Centinel of the i8th of Decem 
ber, copied from the Connecticut Courant, which was supposed 
to have been written by Ellsworth, or Sherman, or some 
equally able champion of the Constitution. 7 The most 
elaborate reply to George Mason s " Objections " was that 
made by James Iredell, of North Carolina, published in the 
biography of the latter, and reprinted among the pamphlets

collected by Mr. Ford. James Wilson, of Pennsylvania, was 
one of the most prominent advocates of the Constitution, 
in its unamended shape, and his pamphlet in its defence is 
considered the ablest on that side that appeared at this 
period. An amusing " Recipe for an anti-Federalist essay, 
which was published in one of the newspapers of the day, 
brings Wilson and Mason together as typical men of the two 
parties. The phrase " well-born," alluded to as a shibboleth 
of the Federalists, belonged to John Adams, and will be 
met with later in the debates of the Virginia Convention : 

" Take well-born nine times ; aristocracy nine times ; lib 
erty of the press thirteen times ; * liberty of conscience once ; 
negro slavery once ; trial by jury seven times ; great men 
six times ; * Mr. Wilson forty times ; and lastly, George Mason s 
right hand in a cutting-box nineteen times. Put all together, 
boil or roast or fry, and dish at pleasure. After being once 
used the remains of the same dish may be served a dozen times 
ad libitum." 

Edmund Randolph published a letter embodying his objec 
tions to the Constitution, and Richard Henry Lee wrote 
very ably in advocacy of amendments to the charter of gov 
ernment as it then stood. As Mason and Randolph had 
been the Virginia Antifederalists of the Convention, so 
Richard Henry Lee and William Grayson were leaders of 
this party in Congress. The following letter from Richard 
Henry Lee to George Mason, written in reply to one from 
the latter, giving an account of the last days of the Conven 
tion, details the action of Lee in Congress in his efforts to 
advance the cause which he had at heart. Unfortunately, 
all the letters of Mason to Lee written at this period have 
been lost. Tradition says that the wife of Ludwell Lee, son 
of R. H. Lee, converted many of these letters into covers 
for her preserve-jars, and so like similar treasures among the 
Bland Papers, which served to line baskets of eggs, they 
perished ignobly. 

1 Review in The Nation, January 17, 1889. 



RICHARD HENRY LEE TO GEORGE MASON. 185 

NEW YORK, October ist, 1787. 
DEAR SIR : 

I have waited until now to answer your favor of September 
loth from Philadelphia, that I might inform you how the Con 
vention plan of government was entertained by Congress. Your 
prediction of what would happen in Congress was exactly veri 
fied. It was with us, as with you, this or nothing ; and this 
urged with a most extreme intemperance. The greatness of the 
powers given, and the multitude to be created produces a coali 
tion of monarchy men, military men, aristocrats and drones, 
whose noise, impudence and zeal exceeds all belief. Whilst the 
commercial plunder of the South stimulates the rapacious trader. 
In this state of things the patriot voice is raised in vain for such 
changes and securities as reason and experience prove to be 
necessary against the encroachments of power upon the indis 
pensable rights of human nature. Upon due consideration of 
the Constitution under which we now act, some of us were 
clearly of opinion that the Thirteenth Article of the Confedera 
tion precluded us from giving an opinion concerning a plan sub 
versive of the present system, and eventually forming a new 
Confederacy of nine instead of thirteen States. The contrary 
doctrine was asserted with great violence in expectation of the 
strong majority with which they might send it forward under 
terms of much approbation. Having procured an opinion that 
Congress was qualified to consider, to amend, to approve or dis 
approve, the next game was to determine that though a right to 
amend existed, it would be highly inexpedient to exercise that 
right, but merely to transmit it with respectful marks of appro 
bation. In this state of things I availed myself of the right to 
amend, and moved the amendments, a copy of which I send 
herewith, and called the ayes and nays to fix them on the jour 
nal. This greatly alarmed the majority and vexed them ex 
tremely ; for the plan is to push the business on with great 
dispatch, and with as little opposition as possible, that it may be 
adopted before it has stood the test of reflection and due exami 
nation. They found it most eligible at last to transmit it merely, 
without approving or disapproving, provided nothing but the 
transmission should appear on the journal. This compromise 
was settled and they took the opportunity of inserting the word 



1 86 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

unanimously, which applied only to simple transmission, hoping 
to have it mistaken for an unanimous approbation of the thing. 
It states that Congress having received the Constitution unani 
mously transmit it, &c. It is certain that no approbation was 
given. This Constitution has a great many excellent regulations 
in it, and if it could be reasonably amended would be a fine 
system. As it is, I think t is past doubt, that if it should be estab 
lished, either a tyranny will result from it, or it will be prevented 
by a civil war. I am clearly of opinion with you that it should 
be sent back with amendments reasonable, and assent to it 
withheld until such amendments are admitted. You are well 
acquainted with Mr. Stone and others of influence in Maryland. 
I think it will be a great point to get Maryland and Virginia to 
join in the plan of amendments and return it with them. If you 
are in correspondence with our chancellor Pendleton it will be 
of much use to furnish him with the objections, and if he approves 
our plan, his opinion will have great weight with our Conven 
tion ; and I am told that his relation Judge Pendleton of South 
Carolina has decided weight in that State, and that he is sensible 
and independent. How important will it be then to procure his 
union with our plan, which might probably be the case if our 
chancellor was to write largely and pressingly to him on the sub 
ject, that if possible it may be amended there also. It is certainly 
the most rash and violent proceeding in the world to cram thus 
suddenly into men a business of such infinite moment to the 
happiness of millions. One of your letters will go by the packet 
and one by a merchant ship. 

My compliments, if you please, to your lady and to the young 
ladies and gentlemen. 

I am, dear sir, affectionately yours, 

RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

Suppose when the Assembly recommended a Convention to 
consider this new Constitution they were to use some words like 
these : It is earnestly recommended to the good people of Virginia 
to send their most wise and honest men to this Convention that it 
may undergo the most intense consideration before a plan shall 
be without amendments, adopted that admits of abuses being 
practised by which the best interests of this country may be

injured and civil liberty greatly endangered. This might per 
haps give a decided tone to the business. 

Please to send my son Ludwell a copy of the amendments 
proposed by me to the new Constitution sent herewith. 1 

These amendments correspond almost entirely with the 
" Objections " of George Mason. The chief variation is in the 
manner of composing the Executive Council. Washington 
wrote to Madison on the loth of October, soon after receiv 
ing George Mason s letter with his " Objections to the 
Constitution " : 

" As far as accounts have been received from the southern and 
western counties, the sentiment with respect to the proceedings 
of the Convention is favorable. Whether the knowledge of this 
or a conviction of the impropriety of withholding the Constitu 
tion from the State conventions, has worked most in the breast of 
Col. Mason, I will not decide ; but the fact is, he has declared 
unequivocally, in a letter to me, for its going to the people. Had 
his sentiments, however, been opposed to the measure, his in 
structions (for the delegates of his county are so instructed) 
would compel him to vote for it. Yet I have no doubt, that his 
assent will be accompanied by the most tremendous apprehen 
sions which the highest coloring can give to his objections. To 
alarm the people seems to be the groundwork of his plan. The 
want of a qualified navigation act is already declared to be a 
means by which the price of produce in the Southern States will 
be reduced to nothing, and will become a monopoly of the East 
ern and Northern States. To enumerate the whole of his objec 
tions is unnecessary, because they are detailed in the address of 
the seceding members of the Assembly of Pennsylvania, which, 
no doubt, you have seen." 

Comparing George Mason and Richard Henry Lee, Wash 
ington adds : 

" The political tenets of Col. M. and Colonel R. H. L. are 
always in unison. It may be asked which of them gives the tone ? 
Without hesitation I answer the latter because I believe the latter

will receive it from no-one. He has, I am informed, rendered 
himself obnoxious in Philadelphia by the pains he took to dis 
seminate his objections among some of the leaders of the seceding 
members of the legislature of that State. His conduct is not less 
reprobated in this country. How it will be relished generally is 
yet to be learned by me." l 

The late commander-in-chief clearly belongs to the " mili 
tary men " of whom Richard Henry Lee speaks in his letter 
to Mason. He advocated a strong government, and could 
see no need for bills of rights. He was not in a temper to 
appreciate the motives of the opposition leaders. But it is 
difficult to see why he should think it necessary to take from 
George Mason the credit of originality, on a subject which 
had been so thoroughly canvassed by him in the Federal 
Convention, and to suppose that Lee gave the " tone " to 
his " political tenets." Two independent thinkers may be 
" always in unison," it has been often seen, upon principles 
which each one has arrived at by his own method. So the 
mere fact that Mason s " Objections " antedated Lee s 
" Amendments " would not be an argument against Lee s 
originality, though his paper closely resembled that of his 
friend. Five days later Washington wrote to Henry Knox : 

" It is highly probable that the refusal of our Governor and 
Colonel Mason to subscribe to the proceedings of the Convention 
will have a bad effect in this State ; for as you well observe, they 
must not only assign reasons for the justification of their own 
conduct, but [it is highly probable that these reasons will be 
clothed in most terrific array for the purpose of alarming." 2 

The Virginia Assembly met on the 1 5th of October. It was 
the last Assembly under the old freer life of the Confederation ; 
and it was to be Colonel Mason s last session in the Virginia 
Legislature. Besides the regular business of the Assembly, 
the all-important question of the new Federal Constitution 
was to come up, incidentally, in the recommendation of a

APPREHENSIONS OF THE FEDERALISTS. 189 

convention. Madison wrote from Congress to Washington 
on the 28th, expressing his anxiety as to the attitude on this 
point of George Mason and Patrick Henry. He had heard 
from one of his correspondents in the Assembly " that Colo 
nel Mason had not got down, and it appears that Mr. Henry 
is not at bottom a friend." He is therefore " not without 
fears that their combined influence and management may yet 
create difficulties." 1 The resolution of Congress transmit 
ting the Constitution to the several State legislatures came 
under consideration on the iQth, when Patrick Henry de 
clared that it must go before a convention of the people, as 
the Assembly had no power to decide the matter. George 
Mason must have arrived in the Assembly by the 23d, as on 
this day Edmund Randolph wrote to Madison from Rich 
mond : u Mr. Mason has declared in Assembly that although 
he is for amendments, he will not quit the Union even if 
they should not be made." Then follows a phrase in this 
letter showing that there had been some display of feeling 
on Mason s part, apparently, against Madison, which is not 
to be wondered at under the circumstances. The indistinct 
manuscript reads : " Colonel Mason has said nothing good 
[sic] and you may rest yourself in safety in my hands, for I 
will certainly repel the smallest insinuation." 2 If Madison 
feared the influence of Mason, it might well be that Mason 
returned the compliment. Already the Federalist had begun 
its work, in which Madison s pen was to be so potent. 
And George Mason must have viewed with chagrin a publi 
cation which was to do so much towards establishing political 
views of which he emphatically disapproved. However, as 
will be seen subsequently, the two statesmen, if estranged 
for a short period, renewed later their former friendly 
relations. 

On the 25th of October the House debated the question 
of calling a convention, and the following account is given 
of the proceedings in a letter from Petersburg to a Phila-

190 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MA SOX. 

delphia newspaper, dated November ist, the only record 
that has been preserved of the debate, it would seem. The 
writer says : " On Thursday last the House of Delegates of 
this State took under consideration the resolution of Con 
gress by which the appointment of a State Convention was 
recommended." The debate was opened by Francis Corbin, 
who " spoke with approbation of the new plan of govern 
ment." He closed his speech with a resolution that a 
convention be called according to the recommendation of 
Congress. Patrick Henry rose to oppose the resolution, as 
it then stood. 

" He did not question the propriety or necessity of calling a 
Convention. No man was more truly Federal than himself, but 
he conceived that, if this resolution was adopted, the Convention 
would only have it in their power to say that the new plan should 
be adopted, or rejected, and that however defective it might appear 
to them, they would not be authorised to propose amendments. 
There were errors and defects in the Constitution, and he there 
fore proposed the addition of some words to Mr. Corbin s reso 
lutions by which the power of proposing amendments might be 
given." 

Mr. Corbin defended his resolution, and George Nicholas 
seconded his defence. 

" He warmly reprobated Mr. Henry s amendment, because it 
would give the impression that the Virginia Assembly thought 
amendments might be made to the new government, whereas he 
believed there was a decided majority in its favor. At the same 
time he did not deny the right of the Convention to propose 
amendments." 

The writer goes on to say : 

" Mr. Mason, who had just taken his seat in the House, rose 
to second Mr. Henry s motion. He told the Committee that he 
felt somewhat embarrassed at the situation in which he then 
stood. He had been honored with a seat in the Federal Con 
vention, and all knew that he had refused to subscribe to their 
proceedings. This might excite some surprise, but it was not 



DEBATE IN THE HOUSE OF DELEGATES. 191 

necessary at that hour, he said, to make known his reasons ; at 
a proper season they should be communicated to his countrymen. 
He would, however, declare that no man was more completely 
federal in his principles than he was : that from the east of 
New Hampshire to the south of Georgia, there was not a man 
more fully convinced of the necessity of establishing some general 
government : that he regarded our perfect union as the rock of 
our political salvation : but, that he had considered the new 
federal government according to that measure of knowledge 
which God had given him that he had endeavored to make 
himself master of the important subject ; that he had deeply and 
maturely weighed every article of the new Constitution ; and 
with every information which he could derive, either from his 
own reflection, or the observations of others, he could not approve 
it. He said : I thought it wrong, Mr. Chairman, I thought it 
repugnant to our highest interests, and if with these sentiments I 
had subscribed to it, I might have been justly regarded as a 
traitor to my country. I would have lost this hand before it 
should have marked my name to the new government. 

John Marshall spoke next : 

" He thought Mr. Corbin s resolution improper for the reason 
given by Mr. Henry. He thought Mr. Henry s amendment 
improper for the reasons given by Mr. Nicholas. He wished 
that the future Convention should have the fullest latitude in 
their deliberations, etc., but he thought, with Mr. Nicholas, that 
the people should have no reason to suppose that their Legisla 
ture disapproved the new federal government, and therefore he 
proposed this resolution : That a Convention should be called, 
and that the new Constitution should be laid before them for their 
free and ample discussion." 

This resolution passed without opposition. The other 
speakers in the debate were Prentis, Bland, Thruston, and 
Benjamin Harrison. And it was decided that the conven 
tion should meet in May, the election of members to take 
place in March. 1

journal of the Assembly occurs on the 26th of October, the 
day after the debate just given, when he is added to the 
Committees on Revenue and Trade. Between this date and 
the 8th of November there is no further reference to him in 
the journal, but we learn from other sources how he was 
employed. On Saturday, the 3d of November, he answered 
the expectations of his friends by giving the death-blow to 
paper currency. In a letter to Washington, written a few 
days later, he tells of the petitions before the House for an 
emission of paper money, and other similar expedients, 
against which he argued, maintaining that they were founded 
upon fraud and knavery. Though he called upon the advo 
cates of these measures to come forward and explain their 
motives, not one of them was bold enough to enter the lists 
against such a champion, and the resolutions which he had 
prepared passed unanimously. 

" Resolved, 6&lt;r., That the present scarcity of circulating money 
has been, in a great measure, caused by the general fear and 
apprehension of an emission of paper currency ; inducing monied 
men to lock up their gold and silver, or remit it to Europe, and 
prefer receiving a very low interest for it there, to the risk of 
lending or letting it out here ; That money, by the common 
consent and custom of commercial nations, is and ought to be 
considered as a scale or standard by which to estimate the com 
parative value of commodities ; and that nothing can be more 
improper and unjust than to substitute such a standard as would 
be more uncertain and variable than the commodities themselves. 
That an emission of paper money would be ruinous to trade and 
commerce, and highly injurious to the good people of this Com 
monwealth ; and that by weakening their confidence in the laws 
and government, corrupting their manners and morals, destroying 
public and private credit and all faith between man and man, it 
would increase and aggravate the very evils it is intended to 
remedy ; That the making paper currency, or anything but gold 
and silver coin, a tender in discharge of debts contracted in 
money is contrary to every principle of sound policy as well as 
justice." 1

VIRGINIA AND THE MISSISSIPPI NA VIGA TION. 193 

In the first resolution an amendment was made, striking 
out " remit to Europe, &c.," and inserting " preferring the 
loss of interest." George Mason enclosed a copy of these 
resolutions in his letter to Washington. And he tells his 
correspondent of a resolution which passed on the third also, 
prohibiting the importation of spirits and some other things, 
all of which he thought impolitic. Madison ascribes this 
resolution to Patrick Henry. 1 A plan was before the House, 
Mason writes, for " a three years instalment of all debts," 
which he thought exceptionable, but as he had no hope that 
the opposition against it would be effective he meant to try 
and change it by making the consent of the creditor neces 
sary and the instalments voluntary. Colonel Mason also 
enclosed Washington the u resolutions upon the proposed 
Federal government." On the 8th of November, the 
House in committee on the state of the commonwealth 
came to the following resolution : 

" That the delegates of this Commonwealth in Congress ought 
to be instructed to urge that honorable body to allow a credit to 
this State against the present existing requisitions of Congress 
for the ascertained amount of the claim of this Commonwealth 
against the United States for expenses incurred on account of 
the territory ceded to Congress by this State." 2 

The committee of ten appointed to prepare these instruc 
tions included George Mason, Patrick Henry, and James 
Monroe. Four days later other important resolutions were 
passed by the House. The question of the free navigation 
of the Mississippi was still unsettled, and the Assembly now 
restated Virginia s position on the subject in these resolu 
tions : 

" That the free use and navigation of the western streams and 
rivers of this Commonwealth and of the waters leading to the 
sea, do of right appertain to the citizens thereof, and ought to be 
considered as guaranteed to them by the laws of God and nature

as well as compact ; That every attempt in Congress or elsewhere 
to barter away such right ought to be considered as subversive 
of justice, good faith and the great foundations of moral recti 
tude, and particularly destructive of the principles which gave 
birth to the late Revolution as well as strongly repugnant to all 
confidence in the Federal Government, and destructive to its 
peace, safety, happiness and duration ; That a committee ought 
to be appointed to prepare instructions to the delegates repre 
senting this State in Congress to the foregoing import, and to 
move that honorable body to pass an act acknowledging the 
rights of this State, and that it transcends their power to cede or 
suspend them ; and desiring the said delegates to lay before the 
General Assembly such transactions as have taken place respect 
ing the cession of the western navigation." l 

Mason and Henry were appointed on the committee here 
recommended. But a subject was presently to be considered 
where these two leaders are found on opposite sides. This 
was the controversy respecting the immediate payment of 
British debts. Should all legal obstacles be removed in the 
way of their liquidation, in accordance with a provision in 
the treaty of peace, or should they remain on the statute 
books until Great Britain fulfilled her part in evacuating the 
posts on the western frontier? George Mason supported 
the resolutions for repealing the former legislation in this 
matter, while Patrick Henry opposed them. The former 
was ably seconded here by George Nicholas. The contest 
lasted three days, but at length George Mason triumphed. 
He gives an interesting account of the debate in a letter to 
Washington of the 2/th of November. The journal of the 
Assembly records that on the i/th, the committee of the 
whole House resolved : " That all and every act or acts of 
Assembly now in force in this Commonwealth repugnant to 
the treaty of peace between the United States and the King 
of Great Britain, or any article thereof, ought to be repealed ; 
but the operation of this law shall be suspended until the 
executive shall be informed by Congress that the other 

1 ibid. 



PAYMENT OF BRITISH DEBTS. 195 



States in the Union have passed similar laws of repeal." A 
motion was made by Patrick Henry to strike out from the 
word " repealed " to the end of the sentence, and insert " but 
the operation of such repeal ought to be suspended until 
the treaty of peace is complied with on the part of Great 
Britain." This amendment passed in the negative. Another 
amendment was then proposed, to insert after the word 
"repealed" " and that an act ought to pass, to compel the 
payment of all debts due to British subjects, in such time 
and manner as shall consist with the exhausted situation of 
this Commonwealth." This was also negatived, and the 
main question then passed in the affirmative. 1 The commit 
tee of ten to whom the resolution was then referred, to 
prepare the necessary bill, consisted of Francis Corbin, 
George Mason, George Nicholas, and others, concluding 
with Monroe and Marshall. George Mason wrote Washing 
ton how " Mr. C n, with the vanity so natural to a 
young man," undertook to draw up the bill without consult 
ing his colleagues, and did his work so injudiciously that it 
would require to be " regenerated " in the committee before 
it could be presented. On the 24th a bill passed the House 
declaring tobacco receivable in payment of certain taxes for 
the year 1787. George Mason voted against it, and in his 
letter to Washington he speaks of it as " a foolish and inju 
dicious project." Colonel Mason, on this day, was added to 
the committee " to amend the several acts making provision 
for the poor." On the 26th he was made chairman of a 
committee of seven who were to bring in a bill explaining 
and amending " the act for preventing fraudulent gifts of 
slaves." The following day, leave was given to bring in a 
bill " to remedy abuses in certain cases, and for the relief of 
debtors," and George Mason was one of a committee of six 
appointed to prepare it. 2 In his letter to Washington of 
this date, Colonel Mason says : " Little progress has yet been 
made on the subject of revenue. I shall use my best endeav 
ors to prevent the receipt of public securities of any kind 
1 Ibid. Ihid. 



196 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



iii taxes. ... By way of experiment, and to show the 
members the utility of such a plan, we have this day, against 
a strong opposition, ordered about ,6,000 now in the 
treasury to be immediately applied to that purpose," [/ . r., 
purchasing the securities up at the market-price]. On the 
28th, the House in committee of the whole on the state of 
the commonwealth, resolved : " That the executive ought to 
be authorized to dispose of the public tobacco now in the 
treasury, in such manner and for specie, or such public 
securities, whether State or Continental, as may seem to 
them best for the public interest." And George Mason was 
appointed on the committee to prepare the necessary bills. 

Two days later, resolutions passed the House, making 
provision " for ascertaining the privileges and defraying the 
expenses " of the members of the Convention, which was to 
meet the first Monday in the following June, instead of 
May as at first decided on. And it was further resolved, 
that if this Convention " should deem it proper to send 
a deputy or deputies to confer with the Convention or 
Conventions of any other State or States in the Union, the 
General Assembly will make provision for defraying the 
expenses thereof." 1 Patrick Henry and George Mason 
were placed second and third on the committee appointed 
for this purpose. This last resolution was considered a 
triumph for the Antifederalists, and gave the other party 
no small alarm. Bushrod Washington wrote an account of 
the matter, three days later, December 3d, to his anxious 
relative at " Mount Vernon." He says : 

" I am sorry to inform you, that the Constitution has lost 
so considerably that it is doubted whether it has any longer 
a majority in its favor. From a vote which took place the other 
day, this would appear certain, though I cannot think it so 
decisive as its enemies consider it. It marks, however, the 
inconsistency of some of its opponents. At the time the resolu 
tions calling a Convention were entered into, Colonel Mason 
sided with the friends of the Constitution, and opposed any hint 

1 Ibid. 



PROVISION FOR THE CONVENTION IN JUNE. 197 



being given, expressive of the sentiments of the house as to 
amendments [?]. But, as it was unfortunately omitted at that 
time to make provision for the subsistence of the Convention, it 
became necessary to pass some resolution on the subject ; when 
a resolution was added, providing for any expense which may 
attend an attempt to make amendments. As Colonel Mason 
had, on the former occasion, declared that it would be improper 
to make any discovery of the sentiments of the House on the 
subject, and that we had no right to suggest anything to a 
body paramount to us, his advocating such a resolution was 
matter of astonishment. It is true, he declared, it was not 
declaratory of our opinion. But the contrary must be very 
obvious. As I have heard many declare themselves friends to 
the Constitution since the vote, I do not consider it altogether 
decisive of the opinion of the House with regard to it." 

There was some debate in the Assembly, evidently, on 
these resolutions. But it may be certain, whatever George 
Mason said on the 3Oth of November was not inconsistent 
with the opinions so emphatically expressed by him on the 
25th of October. 

On the ist of December, Colonel Mason and several other 
members were appointed to prepare a bill " to supply the 
defect of evidence of the Royal assent to certain Acts of 
Assembly under the former government." And on this day 
the vexed question of the British debts was again before the 
House, and two amendments were made to the bill. The 
first two clauses, including the preamble, were stricken out 
and the following was inserted : 

" Whereas it is stipulated by the fourth article of the treaty of 
peace between the king of Great Britain and the United States 
of America in Congress assembled, that creditors on either side 
shall meet with no lawful impediment in the recovery of the full 
value in sterling money, of all bona fide debts heretofore con 
tracted. Be it therefore enacted, &c. That such of the act 
or acts of the legislature of this Commonwealth, as have pre 
vented, or might prevent, the recovery of debts due to British 
"Writings of Washington," Sparks, vol. ix., p. 273. 



198 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



subjects, according to the true intent and meaning of the said 
treaty of peace, shall be and are hereby repealed." 

This first amendment may have been due to the making 
over in the committee of the illy drawn instrument as it 
came from Mr. Corbin s hands. But the second amendment 
showed Patrick Henry s influence, and in fact was meant to 
nullify the whole bill. The proviso that the operation of 
the law shall be suspended until the Governor with the 
advice of the Council shall, by his proclamation declare 
the same to be in force ; which proclamation he is hereby 
empowered and directed, with the advice aforesaid to issue 
on receiving official information from Congress that the 
other States in the Union have passed laws enabling British 
creditors to recover their debts agreeably to the terms of 
the treaty, was struck out and in its place was inserted : 

" Provided that this act shall be suspended until the Governor 
with the advice of the Council shall, by his proclamation notify 
to this State that Great Britain hath delivered up to the United 
States the posts therein now occupied by British troops, which 
posts were stipulated by treaty to be given up to Congress imme 
diately after the conclusion of peace ; and is also taking measures 
for the further fulfilment of the said treaty, by delivering up the 
negroes belonging to the citizens of this State taken away con 
trary to the seventh article of the treaty, or by making such 
compensation for them as shall be satisfactory to Congress." l 

Patrick Henry " carried his point," as Madison wrote 
Jefferson. 2 

No doubt the subject was warmly debated this day also 
between Mason and Henry. There was much to be said on 
both sides, and that side advocated by Patrick Henry was 
the one most likely to appeal to popular favor. An attack 
was made on the church glebes at this time, on a petition of 
the Presbyterians praying a repeal of the law reserving to 

1 Journal of the Assembly.

OTHER WORK IN THE ASSEMBLY. 199 

the Episcopal Church the church buildings and glebes. 
George Mason was not prepared to go the length of depriv 
ing the Church of her rightful property, and he voted 
against the resolution to sell the glebe lands in the parishes 
which were without a rector. And it was not until some 
years after Colonel Mason s death that the spoliation was 
effected. On the 6th of December the House in com 
mittee of the whole, considering that " the distresses of the 
people, arising from a variety of causes, are such, that 
property taken in execution to satisfy debts and contracts, 
does not in most cases sell for near its value, thereby in the 
end tending to the ruin both of debtor and creditor. Re 
solved &c. That some act of the legislature ought to pass 
for remedy thereof ; That an act ought to pass for establish 
ing district courts, and for reforming the county courts." 
George Mason, Patrick Henry, and George Nicholas were 
on the committee of sixteen, who were to prepare a bill for 
these purposes. 1 A resolve which Colonel Mason enclosed 
to Washington in his letter of November 2/th was on this 
subject of debts, and suggested a measure for the accom 
modation of both debtor and creditor. A few days later 
George Mason was made chairman of a committee to amend 
two acts concerning roads, to repair some and open others. 
These roads passed through Colonel Mason s own neighbor 
hood, so it was a matter in which his constituents were 
specially interested. The former acts, it seems, had proved 
oppressive, in requiring tolls from those who received no 
benefit by the turnpikes. The new bill, as drawn up by 
George Mason remedied this injustice. As much travelling 
in those days was done by private conveyance, the subject 
of tolls was an important one to the country gentlemen. 
The report of the treasurer s account was referred to a com 
mittee of which Colonel Mason was a member. And on 
the seventeenth he was appointed one of a committee of 
five to prepare a bill u concerning debts due to and from 
citizens, partners with British subjects." A committee, con-

sisting of Nicholas, Mason, Cabell, Monroe, Corbin, and 
Henry, was appointed to amend the acts " for sequestering 
British property and enabling those indebted to British 
subjects to pay off such debts, and directing the proceed 
ings in suits where such subjects are parties." 

George Mason was also at this time appointed chairman 
of a committee of six, who were " to call on the commission 
ers now engaged in liquidating and adjusting the expenses 
incurred by this commonwealth, for the northwestern terri 
tory ceded to Congress, and request of them a statement 
of their proceedings therein &c." On the 22d of December 
George Mason was appointed chairman of a committee of 
six to prepare a bill " for regulating the rights of cities,, 
towns and boroughs, and the jurisdiction of corporation 
courts." This act recites : 

" Whereas the accumulating different and distinct offices of 
power and authority in the same persons has a tendency to 
introduce abuses, and to create an improper and dangerous 
influence in a few individuals, contrary to the spirit and genius 
of republican government, and naturally productive of oppres 
sion and subversive of liberty : Be it therefore enacted by the 
General Assembly, that from and after the first day of March 
next, no person being a member of any corporation court, court 
of hustings or common council be capable of acting as a justice 
of any county court." 

And in conclusion it is enacted that, 

" Whereas it is contrary to the true principles of representa 
tion, that a freehold estate in any particular place should enable 
the possessor to vote in the elections of different and distinct 
places, so the citizens of a town etc., sending a delegate to the 
Assembly are not to vote in the county elections." 2 

In its statesman-like recurrence to fundamental principles 
this bill is easily traceable to George Mason s pen. A week 
later, Colonel Mason reported a bill to the House, " pro-

viding for the regular payment of the expenses accruing 
from the trial of criminals in the county and corporation 
courts." In a bill providing for the manumission of slaves, 
an amendment was proposed and lost, that those emanci 
pated should leave the State within twelve months or be 
sold at public auction. Colonel Mason voted for the amend 
ment. On the last day of December an act was passed by 
the Assembly for establishing and incorporating the Ran 
dolph Academy, which was to be situated in the western 
part of the State, in one of the following counties : Har 
rison, Monongalia, Randolph, and Ohio. One sixth of 
the fees appropriated to the support of William and Mary 
College was to go to the aid of this new institution. Ed 
mund Randolph, Benjamin Harrison, Patrick Henry, George 
Mason, and George Nicholas were among the trustees 
named, and they were to hold their first meeting on the 
second Monday in the following May, at Morgantown in 
Monongalia. 1 It is not probable that Colonel Mason 
attended this meeting, if it was ever held. And but little 
is heard of the Academy in the later legislation of the 
Assembly. Morgantown and its neighborhood were still 
subject to raids from the Indians on the border, and pro 
tected by scouts and rangers from these incursions, and the 
inhabitants were scarcely in a situation to patronize institu 
tions of learning. George Mason and three other members 
of the Assembly were appointed on the 3d of January to 
bring in a bill " to authorize the executive to establish fire 
companies." Two days later the journal of the House 
records a determined effort that was made, when it came 
to the third reading of the bill " to enable citizens, partners 
with British subjects to recover their proportion of debts/ 
to postpone it until the following March. The vote was 
equally divided, forty-three on each side. The Speaker 
decided the question by a vote in the negative. George 
Mason, of course, voted against the postponement. 

The last action of Colonel Mason in the Assembly was to

give in his report from the committee appointed to confer 
with the commissioners engaged in liquidating and adjusting 
the expenses incurred by Virginia for the northwestern terri 
tory ceded to Congress. And here, it seems, it was necessary 
to look sharply to Virginia s interests. Congress was un 
generously anxious to evade Virginia s just claims. There 
had been much delay in getting the board appointed, the 
deed of cession dating from the spring of 1784, more than 
three years previously. There were three commissioners 
forming the board ; one was appointed by the United States 
and one by Virginia, while the third w r as appointed by the 
two other commissioners. George Mason enclosed the 
resolve of the House of Delegates to the board, in a letter 
requesting to know at what time they could have their pro 
ceedings ready for inspection. The board from the " Office 
of Illinois Accounts," December 2Oth, responded that they 
were uncertain whether to comply or not, but finally decided 
that it was proper to notice the request, and they would 
submit the rough entries for perusal by Monday or Tuesday 
next. The commissioner appointed by Congress, however, 
dissented from the " propriety of our furnishing the informa 
tion to the house of delegates requested by their note &c., 
because that as commissioners appointed to settle these ac 
counts between the State of Virginia and the United States I 
think that we cannot prior to our final report, consistent with 
our duty to each party communicate any official information 
to one party without the privity or consent of the other." 
The committee then say that being refused information from 
the above commissioner they entered upon the examination 
of the proceedings of the board as laid before them by the 
other two gentlemen. The deed ceding the territory speci 
fied " that the necessary and reasonable expenses incurred 
by this State in subduing any British posts, or in maintain 
ing forts and garrisons within and for the defence, or in 
acquiring any part of the territory so ceded or relinquished, 
shall be fully reimbursed by the United States." But the 
committee, after their examination, declare that they " find

the negotiation now in such a train that Virginia, unless the 
General Assembly interpose, will be denied a credit for 
great part of the money she has actually and bona fide paid, 
in acquiring and maintaining the territory so ceded and 
relinquished to the United States. Questions have arisen 
concerning the true spirit, intent and meaning of the words 
necessary and reasonable expenses, as used in the act of 
session ; on the depreciation of money advanced by this 
State ; on bills paid, bona fide by the State on the Illinois 
account, and on the expenses of establishing and maintain 
ing forts Jefferson and Nelson &c. Your committee," as the 
report proceeds to state, " observing the progress of this 
business, so unfavorable to the interest of the State and so 
inconsistent with the apparent intentions of the contracting 
parties, requested the commissioners to reconsider the busi 
ness and to do Virginia that justice to which, in the opinion 
of the committee, she is entitled. But the commissioner on 
the part of Congress and the third commissioner have in 
formed us that they mean to proceed unless the powers 
given them be revoked by both the contracting parties." 
Virginia had incurred expenses in subduing British posts 
and maintaining forts, etc., to the amount of more than two 
hundred and twenty thousand pounds. And yet if the 
accounts were settled as proposed by the commission, this 
would be " reduced to a pittance not worth acceptance." 
The General Assembly protested against these proceedings 
of the commissioners, and the Virginia delegates in Con 
gress were instructed to assure that body that the General 
Assembly " animated by the same spirit which governed 
them in the cession of such a vast territory to the Union, 
will be satisfied with the reimbursement of such sums which 
she [Virginia] hath actually expended in acquiring, main 
taining and defending said territory to be paid in reasonable 
instalments." These resolutions were carried to the 
Senate by Colonel Mason. Instrumental as he had been in 
urging upon his State to make this cession, in the interest of

harmony and union, to the general government, George 
Mason was watchful of his " country s " rights, and he now 
sought, as his final work in her legislative halls, to secure to 
Virginia the modest and equitable terms named in her deed 
of gift. 

The following letters from George Mason to General 
Washington afford an interesting view of the proceedings of 
the Assembly up to the latter part of November. 

RICHMOND, NOVEMBER 6, 1787. 
DEAR SIR : 

On Saturday last, in a committee of the whole house upon the 
state of the commonwealth, to whom were referred sundry peti 
tions, some praying for an emission of paper money, and others 
for making property at an appraised value, a tender in the dis 
charge of debts, I moved and carried the resolutions of which I 
inclose a copy. During the discussion of the subject, alter treat 
ing the petitions as founded upon fraud and knavery, I called 
upon any of the members of the House, who were advocates for 
such measures, if any there were, to come boldly forward, and 
explain their real motives. But they declined entering into the 
debate, and the resolutions passed unanimously. I hope they 
have given this iniquitous measure a mortal stab, and that we 
shall not again be troubled with it. 

A resolution this day passed for an absolute prohibition of all 
imported spirits, with some others, in my opinion, almost equally 
impolitic, and calculated to subject the eastern part of the State 
to the arbitrary impositions of the western. The prohibition of 
the single article of rum, would cut off a net revenue of eleven 
thousands pounds per annum. When the bill is brought in, I 
think they will find such insuperable difficulties in the mode of 
carrying into execution, as will oblige them to abandon the project. 

I take the liberty of inclosing a copy of the resolutions upon 
the proposed Federal Government ; by which it will appear 
that the Assembly have given time for full examination and dis 
cussion of the subject, and have avoided giving any opinion of 
their own upon the subject. I beg to be presented to your lady 
and family, and am, with greatest respect and regard, 

GEORGE MASON. 



LETTERS TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 



P. S. A plan is before the House for a three years instalment 
of all debts. Though, in my opinion, very exceptionable, it is 
better than the plans of that kind heretofore proposed, and I be 
lieve will be adopted, in spite of every opposition that can be 
made to it. I shall, therefore, instead of pointing the little oppo 
sition I can make against the whole, endeavour to change the 
plan, by making the consent of the creditor necessary, and the 
instalments voluntary, and, in such cases, giving the force of 
judgments to the instalment bonds. 1 

RICHMOND, November 27, 1787. 
DEAR SIR : 

I this morning received your favor of the fifteenth, and shall 
do myself the honor of communicating such of our proceedings 
as are important ; though very little business, of that kind, has 
yet been completed. The Instalment Plan, after being presented 
to the committee of the whole house upon the state of the com 
monwealth, and some hours debate upon the subject, has been 
postponed from time to time. From the best information I can 
collect, I fear there is a majority for it ; I shall therefore, when 
ever the committee proceed upon the consideration, endeavor to 
substitute the Resolve, of which I enclose a copy, and upon 
which I wish to be favored with your sentiments. 

The performance of the treaty with respect to British debts, 
has taken up three days of warm debate ; Mr. Henry, General 
Lawson and Meriwether Smith on one side, and Col. George 
Nicholas (who is improved into a very useful member) and my 
self on the other. The yeas and nays were demanded upon these 
questions on this subject ; first upon an amendment proposed by 
Mr. Henry for suspending the operation until the treaty should 
be fully performed on the part of Great Britain, which was 
rejected by a majority of thirty-three ; secondly upon an amend 
ment proposed by Mr. Ronald, tantamount to an instalment of 
British debts. Knowing that instalments were calculated to 
please a strong party, we avoided going into the subject at large, 
and confined ourselves to the impropriety of installing British 
debts, before we could know the sense of the legislature upon a 
general instalment of all debts ; as any discrimination would be 

1 " Correspondence of the American Revolution," Sparks, vol. iv., p. 190. 



206 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON, 

a palpable infraction of the treaty. The amendment was rejected 
by a majority of twenty-two ; the main question was then put 
upon the resolve for repealing all laws which prevented the 
recovery of British debts, with a clause suspending the operation 
of the repeal until other States shall also pass laws to enable 
British subjects to recover debts, and carried by a majority of 
forty. A bill has been brought in in consequence of the said 
Resolve, once read and committed to a committee of the whole 
house on Friday next. Some of the most respectable characters 
in the house were nominated a committee to prepare the bill ; 

but Mr. C n with the vanity so natural to a young man, took 

upon himself to draw without the other gentlemen having time 
to consider it, and has drawn it so very injudiciously, that in its 
present shape, it would infallibly be thrown out on the third 
reading. However we will take care to regenerate it in the com 
mittee, and I make no doubt of its passing the House of Dele 
gates ; there will be a strong but I trust a fruitless opposition in 
the senate. As soon as the Treaty Bill is secured we will bring 
forward the Sequestration business ; ^275,000 paper currency 
of the average value of about 14^. in the pound having been paid 
into the treasury, in discharge of British debts. In the discussion 
of this subject, I expect we shall see some long faces. 

A bill for receiving tobacco in discharge of taxes will certainly 
pass ; it is in my opinion a foolish and injurious project ; as such 
it was opposed, but to no purpose. After finding their strength, 
the first step was to raise the last year s price of the James river 
tobacco ; we had then nothing left but to endeavor to bring up 
the price of our tobacco in proportion, in which we, with some 
difficulty succeeded, and got our tobacco fixed at 28.?., the James 
river tobacco having been previously settled at 30.5-. 

Little progress has yet been made on the subject of revenue. 
I shall use my best endeavors to prevent the receipt of public 
securities of any kind in taxes (as the only effectual means of 
digging up speculation by the roots) and appropriating a good 
fund for purchasing them up at the market price. By way of 
experiment and to show the members the utility of such a plan, 
we have this day, against a strong opposition, ordered about 
^6,000 now in the treasury, to be immediately applied to that 
purpose ; which I hope will have a good effect upon the minds of 



RESOLVE ON INSTALMENT OF DEBTS. 2O/ 

the members. Yet I fear the interest of the speculators is too 
powerful, to suffer any regular extensive system upon this subject. 

The bill for prohibiting the importation of spirits stands com 
mitted to a committee of the whole house, the day after to-mor 
row. Dr. Stuart tells me he has sent you one of the printed bills ; 
you will find it fraught with such absurdities as render it perfectly 
ridiculous, yet I much doubt their finding them out so as to amend 
the bill in the committee. The opposers ought to let them go on 
their own way, and reserve their attack to the passage on the third 
reading. As the bill now stands, according to the strict gram 
matical construction, spirits are subject to forfeiture after they 
have been swallowed, and the informer will be equally subject to 
the penalty with the persons he informs against. But besides the 
nonsense of the bill, the very principle of it is impolitic as it will 
affect our commerce and revenue ; partial and unjust in sacrific 
ing the interest of one part of the community to the other. I am 
afraid this scrawl is hardly legible, being obliged as I am to write 
with bad spectacles, bad light and bad ink. 

I beg my compliments to your lady, and the family at Mount 
Vernon, and am with the most sincere respect and esteem, 

Dear Sir, 
Your affectionate and obedient servant, 

G. MASON. 

The resolution enclosed, of which the writer asked Wash 
ington s opinion, is to the following effect : 

u Resolved, that it is the opinion of this committee, in order to 
alleviate, as far as is consistent with justice, the present distresses 
of the people of this commonwealth, to prevent tedious and ruin 
ous law-suits, and by making it their mutual interest to encourage 
and promote voluntary and amicable settlements and compositions 
between debtors and creditors, that the force of judgments ought 
to be given to all bonds on account of debts contracted or due 
before the day of 1 7&7, which shall be entered into 

within one year after the day of by the mutual con 

sent of debtor and creditor, for the instalment of debts by annual 
payments, for any number of years not exceeding six years ; and 
that no appeal or replevin ought to be allowed upon the judg-

ments or executions, which shall be obtained in virtue of such 
instalment bonds, when they respectively become due." 1 

Madison in a letter to Jefferson of the Qth of December 
makes the following allusions to the Liquor Bill and the Port 
Bill of this session. He says : 

" I find Mr. Henry has carried a Resolution for prohibiting the 
importation of rum, brandy and other spirits, and, if I am not 
misinformed, all manufactured leather, hats and sundry other 
articles are included in \)&lt;\Q prohibition. Enormous duties at least, 
are likely to take place on the last and many other articles. A 
project of this sort, without the concurrence of the other States, 
is little short of madness. . . . Col. Mason made a regular 
and powerful attack on the Port Bill, but was left in a very small 
majority. I found at the last session that that regulation was not 
to be shaken, though it certainly owes its success less to its 
principal merits than to collateral and casual considerations." 2 

The port bill was amended, however, probably in accord 
ance with Colonel Mason s views. George Mason returned 
to " Gunston Hall " on the 4th of February, and Washington 
wrote to Madison the following day, expressing his anxiety 
about the approaching Convention, the election of delegates 
being the absorbing topic just then. He says : " Many have 
asked me with anxious solicitude, if you did not mean to get 
into the Convention, conceiving it of indispensable import 
ance. Colonel Mason who returned but yesterday, has I am 
told, offered himself for Stafford county and his friends say 
he can be elected, not only in that, but in the counties of 
Prince William and Fauquier also." 3 Here we see Madison 
and Mason were instinctively pitted against each other in 
Washington s thoughts, as leaders of the two parties in the 
approaching struggle. George Mason, on his side was 
anxious to secure Richard Henry Lee as an ally in the Con 
vention. Arthur Lee who probably visited " Gunston

ARTHUR LEE AT " GUNSTON HALL: 209 

Hall " at this time, wrote from Alexandria to his brother on 
the iQth of February : 

" Col. Mason laments very much that you do not stand for the 
Convention. He says there will be no one in whom he can confide. 
That you will be regarded as having deserted a cause on which 
you have published your persuasion of its being of the last 
moment to your country. That this belief will be strengthened 
by a report which some of your friends have propagated, that you 
have given up all idea of opposing the constitution because your 
friends think differently, and have recommended two violent con 
stitutionalists to the freeholders of Westmoreland. He is afraid 
these things will injure your character so much that should 
another General Convention be ordered you will not be among 
the delegates, which he shall consider a misfortune to the country. 
It is his opinion that the Convention will recommend another 
General Convention." 

The letters of the public men in Virginia at this time are 
full of speculations as to the probable complexion of the 
Convention, and the result anticipated was federal or anti- 
federal according to the bias of the writer. Madison writing 
to Jefferson in December, represents " the body of the peo 
ple in Virginia as favorable" to the Constitution. "What 
change," he adds, " may be produced by the united influ 
ence of Mr. Henry, Mr. Mason, and the Governor with some 
pretty able auxiliaries is uncertain." a Cyrus Griffin gave 
currency to some of the extravagant rumors of the day, 
when he wrote from New York, February I5th: 

"Col. R. H. Lee and Mr. John Page, men of influence in Vir 
ginia, are relinquishing their opposition ; but what to us is very 
extraordinary and unexpected, we are told that Mr. George 
Mason has declared himself so great an enemy to the Constitu 
tion that he will heartily join Mr. Henry and others in promoting 
a Southern Confederacy." :

2IO LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

Again, in April, he speaks of the personal characteristics 
of the more eminent members of the opposition in the 
Convention, clearly showing to which side he leaned : 

" In point of virtues and real abilities the federal members are 
much superior. Henry is mighty and powerful, but too inter 
ested ; Mason too passionate, the governor by nature timid and 
undecided, and Grayson too blustering." 

Randolph was still looked upon as an Antifederalist by 
the uninitiated. Madison, about the same time, writes of 
the opponent whom it is probable he most feared : " Colonel 
Mason is growing every day more bitter and outrageous in 
his efforts to carry his point, and will probably in the end 
be thrown by the violence of his passions into the politics of 
Mr. Henry." a Washington wrote to Lafayette in April, ex 
pressing a belief that the Convention would favor the adop 
tion of the Constitution. He adds : " There will, however, be 
powerful and eloquent speeches on both sides of the ques 
tion. . . . Henry and Mason are its great adversaries. 
The Governor, if he opposes it at all, will do it feebly." : 
The position of Edmund Randolph, still undefined to the 
public, was evidently no secret to Washington. George 
Mason s ally in the Convention of 1787 was to be his foe in 
the Convention of 1788, and already in April had given 
token of his tergiversation. Washington s influence in Fair 
fax County had doubtless contributed to the election there 
in March, of Federalists to the Convention. But Stafford 
County elected George Mason with Andrew Buchanan. 
The characteristic story is told of George Mason at this 
time, that " he was informed that if he opposed the ratifica 
tion of the Federal Constitution the people of Alexandria 
would mob him, [when] he mounted his horse, rode to the 
town, and going up the court-house steps, said to the sheriff, 
Mr. Sheriff, will you make proclamation that George Mason

will address the people ? A crowd assembled, and Mason 
addressed them, denouncing the Constitution with bitter 
invective, after which he mounted his horse and returned 
home." One of the opposition delegates, from Loudoun 
County, was George Mason s nephew, Stevens Thomson 
Mason. His vote was always given to the Antifederalists, 
though his youth and modesty prevented him from speaking 
in the Convention. 

Two letters of George Mason, written in April and May, 
are all that remain to us of his correspondence at this 
period. One of them is addressed to Robert Carter, of 
" Nomini," and the other to John Francis Mercer, who had 
been a delegate in the Federal Convention from Maryland, 
and held similar views to Mason on the subject of the Con 
stitution. He had taken charge of some law business for 
Colonel Mason on the death of Thomas Stone, which event 
occurred in Alexandria the previous October : 

(iuxsTox HALL, April 3oth, 1788. 
DEAR SIR : 

This will be delivered you by my son John, who is going to 
settle in Bordeaux, having lately entered into partnership with 
two Maryland gentlemen (Messrs. Joseph and James Fenwick) 
who about a year or two ago established a house there, the firm 
of which has hitherto been Joseph Fenwick and Company. 
Their capital will not be large (only about 1,000 sterling each), 
and their plan is to give no credit, nor even advance more than 
the value of effects in their hands for any man. This at the 
same time that it will enable them to send out their correspond 
ent s goods, upon better terms than those can, who buy upon 
credit, will also be the most effectual means of rendering safe 
whatever property their friends shall think fit to commit to their 
charge. They are determined to examine themselves, into the 
prices and quality of all the goods they send to America ; and as 
wines, brandy, silks, cambrics, chintz, calicoes, and several other 
articles may be purchased in France, of which Bordeaux is one 
of the greatest trading towns, as cheap as in any part of Europe,

they hope to be able to give general satisfaction ; and there 
being no other American house in Bordeaux they flatter them 
selves with considerable encouragement and preference, from 
their own country, so long as they continue to deserve it. They 
daily expect a ship of about 300 hhds. to load in Potomac river, 
upon consignment, to their address. Any tobacco, clear of 
trash and sound, although not of extraordinary quality, will 
answer the French market ; but from the number of British and 
Irish smugglers who frequent Bordeaux, I have reason to believe 
that fine, stout, dark, waxy tobacco, of the best quality, will find 
as good a market there as in Europe. 

If you can make it convenient to encourage the house, with a 
consignment of some of your tobacco, I am sure you will find 
from them the strictest justice ; and I hope their attention to 
their friends interest, by rendering the correspondence mutually 
advantageous, will merit a continuation of your favors,

VIRGINIA, GUNSTON HALL, May i, 1788. 
DEAR SIR : 

Your favor of the i8th of April did not come to hand until to 
day. I am exceedingly obliged to you for the trouble you have 
taken to investigate the situation of my affair with Rutland. Had 
my former counsel, Mr. Stone, taken half as much, it would have 
saved me a great deal of vexation, and probably much loss, which, 
I fear, by his neglect I shall now sustain. 

I thoroughly agree with you in thinking Mr. James Little s debt, 
under the circumstances you mention, must have preference to 
mine, and that my case, so far as it is affected by that debt, is 
without remedy. The only thing which could be done is what 
you have so kindly determined to do, to see that the sale is fairly 
conducted, that the value, as near as circumstances will admit, 
may be procured for that part of the property on which the fi: fa: 

1 MS. Letter. 



LETTER TO JOHN FRANCIS MERGER. 213 

was served for Mr. Little s debt, that my security may be as little 
[word illegible^ by it as possible. I should be glad to know 
whether Rutland s new store, or warehouse and wharf (which I 
conceive the most valuable part of his improvements) are upon 
the part advertised to be sold for Mr. Little s debt. From Rut 
land s account of things, I am also inclined to suspect there has 
been some attempt made by him and Mr. Duvall, to subject my 
mortgaged property to some demand of the State against them. 
Upon reflecting on some past circumstances, I have some hopes 
that, upon examination it will appear that Mrs. Rutland was of 
age when she relinquished her right of dower, on the twenty- 
second of February, 1787. Mr. Rutland went to London with a 
shipload of tobacco in 1 783, and I remember it was reported he 
was engaged to this lady some time before he left the country. 
However, if Mrs. Rutland was not of age at the the time she re 
linquished her right of dower, I hope she will be prevailed on to 
relinquish it now ; not only from motives of justice, as I gave 
Mr. Rutland the indulgence I did, upon the assurance of her re- 
linquishment of dower, but because her relinquishment will do 
her no injury though it may benefit me ; for the land will be sold 
by virtue of Mr. Carroll s mortgage made before her marriage, 
which I presume will bar her claim of dower against the pur 
chaser, and her pretension of dower as to my mortgage would 
have no other effect than injuring me, in causing the land to sell 
for less than its value. I think I have been informed that Mr. 
Rutland had a tract of land or two, particularly one in Mont 
gomery, Frederick or Washington, at the time of my judgment 
against him, which Mr. Stone did not include in my mortgage, 
thinking the mortgaged premises sufficient without ; and if I re 
member right, there is a clause in the mortgage declaring, if they 
should prove insufficient, that I do not lose my remedy against 
any other part of his property. Those lands then, if he had such 
at the time, are still subject to my judgment, in whatsoever hands 
they may now be, and it may probably be a matter of importance 
to me ; as I very much fear that the incumbrances upon the 
mortgaged premises, which I knew nothing of, confiding entirely 
in Mr. Stone on the occasion, will fall short of securing my debt. 
I beg the favor of you, my dear sir, to inquire particularly in this 
matter, and I must also entreat you to push my attachment

against Mr. Stephen West to as speedy decision as you can ; I 
presume Mr. West can have no defence to make but such as tends 
merely to delay. 

I wish to know, as soon as you can conveniently inform me, 
whether you have got my papers from Mr. Stone s executors, par 
ticularly the state of the case in Ross s suit against me for a tract 
of the Ohio Company s land, and your opinion of the said suit. 
I think I gave you some memorandum also respecting the Ohio 
Company s title to a tract of land adjoining Fort Cumberland, 
called the Treasury of Walnut Bottom fraudulently granted by 
Governor Eden to one French, a creature of his. 

From the returns I have seen of the elections here, I think the 
Convention of Virginia will be so equally divided, that no man 
can at present form a judgment of what may be the determina 
tion. The Federalists, as they improperly style themselves, talk 
of a considerable majority ; but it is notorious that many of them 
\torn\ honor of their cause be it spoken, stick at no falsehood or 
[torn] to accomplish their purpose. As soon as any tolerably 
\torn\ judgment can be formed of the politics of our Convention 
I will not fail to communicate them to you.

sincere esteem and regard, dear sir, 

Your affectionate friend and servant,

French market will be as good a one, at least, as any that we can 
send to. 

Give me leave now, dear sir, to make a few observations on 
the important business that will call you to Richmond next 
month. It seems pretty clear at present, that four other States, 
viz., North Carolina, New York, Rhode Island, and New Hamp 
shire, will depend much upon Virginia for their determination 
on the Convention project of a new constitution ; therefore it 
becomes us to be very circumspect and careful about the 
conduct we pursue, as, on the one hand, every possible exertion 
of wisdom and firmness should be employed to prevent danger 
to civil liberty, so, on the other hand, the most watchful precau 
tion should take place to prevent the foes of union, order, and 
good government, from succeeding so far as to prevent our 
acceptance of the good part of the plan proposed. I submit 
to you, sir, whether, to form a consistent union of conduct, 
it would not be well for six or eight leading friends to amend 
ments to meet privately, and, having formed the best possible 
judgment of the members sentiments from knowledge of the 
men, to see how far it may be safe to press either for modes of 
amendment or the extent of amendments, and to govern accord 
ingly. But, certainly, the firmest stand should be made against 
the very arbitrary mode that has been pursued in some States, 
that is, to propose a question of absolute rejection or implicit 
admission. For though it is true that the Convention plan looks 
something like this, yet I think every temperate man must agree 
that neither the Convention, nor any set of men upon earth, have 
or had a right to insist upon such a question of extremity. To 
receive the good and reject the bad is too necessary and inherent 
a right to be parted with. As some subtle managers will be 
upon the Convention, I believe you will find entrapping questions 
proposed at first as a ground-work of proceeding, which will 
hamper, confine, and narrow all attempts to proper investigation 
or necessary amendment, and this will be done under the plaus 
ible pretext of losing all by attempting any change. I judge that 
it will be so here, because I observe a similar conduct has been 
pursued in other places, as in Maryland and Pennsylvania. I 
trust that such uncandid and dangerous stratagems will be 
opposed and prevented in the Convention of Virginia, and a

thorough, particular, and careful examination be first made into 
all its parts as a previous requisite to the formation of any ques 
tion upon it. During this process a tolerable judgment may be 
formed of the sentiments of the generality, and a clue furnished 
for forming successful propositions for amendment, as the candid 
friends to this system admit that amendments may be made to 
improve the plan, but say that these amendments ought to be 
made, and may be obtained from the new Congress without 
endangering a total loss of the proposed Constitution. I say 
that those who talk thus, if they are sincere, will not object to 
this plan which, as I propose it, is something like the proceeding 
of the Convention Parliament of 1688 ; in the form of ratifica 
tion, insert plainly and strongly such amendments as can be 
agreed upon, and say, that the people of Virginia do claim, 
demand and insist upon these as their undoubted rights and lib 
erties which they mean not to part with, and if these are not 
obtained and secured by the mode pointed out in the fifth article 
of the Convention plan, in two years after the meeting of the new 
Congress, that Virginia shall, in that case, be considered as dis 
engaged from this ratification. Under this proposition a develop 
ment will be made of the sincerity of those who advocate the new 
plan, the beneficial parts of it retained, and a just security given 
to civil liberty. In the fifth article it is stated that two-thirds of 
Congress may propose amendments, which, being approved by 
three-fourths of the legislatures, become parts of the Consti 
tution. By this mode, the new Congress may obtain our amend 
ments without risking the convulsion of conventions, and the 
friends of the plan will be gratified in what they say is necessary, 
the putting the government in motion, when, as they again say, 
amendments may and ought to be obtained. By this mode, too, 
in all probability, the undetermined States, may be brought to 
harmonize, and the formidable minorities, in the assenting States, 
may be quieted. By this friendly and reasonable accommoda 
tion, the perpetual distrust and opposition, that will inevitably 
follow the total adoption of the plan, from the State legislatures, 
may be happily prevented, and friendly united exertions take 
place. Much reflection has convinced me that this mode is the 
best that I have had an opportunity of cultivating. I have, 
therefore, taken the liberty of recommending it to your serious

and patriotic attention ; in the formation of these amendments 
localities ought to be avoided as much as possible. 

The danger of monopolized trade may be prevented by calling 
for the consent of three-fourths of the United States on regula 
tions of trade. The trial by jury, in this State, to be insisted on, 
as it is used under our present government, and confining the 
supreme federal court to the jurisdiction of law, excluding fact. 
The Massachusetts amendments, except the second, and extend 
ing the seventh to foreigners as well as citizens of other States, 
appear to me to be very good, and for their adoption the aid ot 
that powerful State may be secured. The freedom of the press 
is, by no means, sufficiently attended to by Massachusetts, nor 
have they remedied the want of responsibility by the impolitic 
combination of president and senate. It does appear to me, 
that, in the present temper of America, if the Massachusetts 
amendments, with those suggested by me, being added, and 
inserted in our ratification as before stated, we may easily agree, 
and I verily believe that the most essential good consequences 
would be the result. 

Affectionately yours, 

RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

George Mason, Esq. :

A curious mention is made of George Mason in a letter of 
Samuel Adams to Richard Henry Lee, showing that he 
had been, apparently, defending Mason against the stric 
tures of the Boston Federalists. Adams writes to his 
Virginia correspondent on the 3d of December, 1787, dis 
cussing the new Constitution, and he adds, in a postscript: 
" As I have thought it a piece of justice, I have ventured to 
say, that I had often heard from the best patriots from 
Virginia, that Mr. G. Mason was an early, active, and able 
advocate for the liberties of America." a There had been 
no opportunity for personal acquaintance between these 
two representative men of their sections, it would seem. 
Yet we can fancy they would have had much sympathy in

their tastes and convictions, for in the characteristics of 
independence, public spirit, and absence of personal ambition 
there is great resemblance between them. And on the 
political question of the hour, Samuel Adams and George 
Mason held the same just views, as to the distinction, as 
Adams phrased it, between the federal powers vested in 
Congress and the sovereign authority belonging to the 
several States, which is the palladium of the private and 
personal rights of the citizens." 




CHAPTER VII. 



IN THE VIRGINIA CONVENTION. 
1788. 

Virginia had assembled in her Convention of 1788, a re 
markable body of men, the flower of her statesmen, sages, 
patriots. It may fairly be affirmed that no other common 
wealth on the continent could have called together as great an 
array of abilities. And yet Virginia had not exhausted her 
resources ; Washington, Jefferson, Richard Henry Lee, were 
not included in this famous Convention. William Wirt, in 
his rhetorical manner, has given a characterization of the 
most conspicuous members. There were, among the younger 
generation Madison, Marshall, Monroe ; there were " those 
sages of other days, Pendleton and Wythe ; there was seen 
displayed the Spartan vigor and compactness of George 
Nicholas ; and there shone the radiant genius and sensibility 
of Grayson ; the Roman energy and the Attic wit of George 
Mason was there ; and there also the classic taste and har 
mony of Edmund Randolph ; * the splendid conflagration 
of the high-minded Innes ; and the matchless eloquence of 
the immortal Henry." 

On the one side were ranged Madison, Marshall, Pendle 
ton, George Nicholas, Innes, and Edmund Randolph ; on the 
other George Mason, Patrick Henry, William Grayson, 
James Monroe, Benjamin Harrison, and John Tyler. " Con 
spicuous among those who opposed the ratification of the 
constitution," writes Flanders, "were Patrick Henry, George

Mason and William Grayson ; a combination of eloquence, 
vigor, and genius, not often surpassed and seldom equalled/ 1 
Says George Ticknor Curtis in his account of the opposition 
to the Constitution in Virginia : 

" The State was to feel, it is true, the almost overshadowing 
influence of Washington in favor of the new system . . . But 
it was to feel also the strenuous opposition of Patrick Henry, that 
great natural orator of the Revolution, whose influence over 
popular assemblies was enormous, and who added acuteness, 
subtility, and logic to the fierce sincerity of his unstudied ha 
rangues, and the not less strenuous or effective opposition of 
George Mason, who had little of the eloquence and passion of 
his renowned compatriot, but who was one of the most profound 
and able of all the American statesmen opposed to the Constitu 
tion, while he was inferior in general powers and resources to not 
more than two or three of those who framed and advocated it." * 

William Grayson, the least known of the great trio in 
opposition, was from George Mason s neighborhood, and 
they were doubtless intimate personal friends. Grayson s 
home was in Dumfries, and on his untimely death, in 1790, 
he was buried in the family vault at " Belle Air," the seat of 
his brother, the Rev. Spence Grayson, rector of Dettingen 
parish, Prince William County, whose country place was 
near the county town. The Graysons, it is believed, were 
first or second cousins of James Monroe, whose father s 
Christian name was Spence. 3 

The Convention met in Richmond on the 2d of June, at 
the " public buildings," or old Capitol, and Edmund Pendle-

3 Mr. William Grayson Mann, whose maternal grandfather, Robert Carter, of 
" Sabine Hall," married William Grayson s only daughter, writes the author : 
I have at different times during the last thirty-five years attempted to collect 
materials for writing the life of this truly great man, but in vain. No state 
papers or speeches in extenso survived the destruction by fire of the old family 
mansion at Dumfries, a few miles south of Mount Vernon, on the Potomac. 
Col. Grayson had studied law at the Inner Temple, where I have found the 
chambers he once occupied."

ton was elected president. A committee of privileges and 
elections being appointed, Benjamin Harrison was named 
chairman, and George Mason came second on the list of 
members. After some preliminary business Colonel Mason 
moved an adjournment, the Convention to meet the next 
day at the " New Academy on Schockoe Hill." This build 
ing, erected in 1786 for the promotion of the arts and scien 
ces, was used also as a theatre. It was burned down later, 
and near it the new theatre was built, destroyed by fire in 
1811, on the site of which now stands the Monumental 
Church. Here at the " New Academy " the Convention held 
their sessions after the first day, and their meetings were 
open to the public, visitors coming from all parts of the 
State to hear the important subject under discussion. And 
the assemblage was a most imposing one numerically. u It 
was," says Grigsby, " more than four times greater than the 
Convention which framed the Federal Constitution when that 
body was full, and it exceeded it, as it ordinarily w r as, more 
than six times." It consisted, as this writer adds, " of the 
public men of three generations." l The army, the judiciary, 
the planters of the State, were the three interests most 
prominent in the representation, and the old soldiers were 
generally in favor of the Constitution, as the habits of the 
army officer naturally lead him to approve of the strong arm 
in government, while the lawyer looks more to the questions 
of principle that are involved, and is more jealous of liberty. 
Of all this assemblage of more or less prominent figures 
there were four, says our historian, who attracted the atten 
tion of strangers before all the rest. Pendleton and Wythe, 
leaders among the Federalists, " with George Mason and 
Patrick Henry, were those first sought by the spectator, as in 
a convention, forty years later, were Madison, Monroe, Mar 
shall, and Fayette." !l George Mason and Patrick Henry had 
rooms at the Swan, a famous tavern on Broad Street, still 
standing, and they were often seen together walking arm in

arm on their way to the Convention. "George Mason was 
dressed in a full suit of black, arid was remarkable for the 
urbanity and dignity with which he received and returned 
the courtesies of those who passed him." : 

A question had been decided on the 2d of June, the first 
day of the Convention, of which we have an account in a 
contemporary newspaper, with the arguments of George 
Mason on the subject. This was, whether Robertson (with 
his assistants), to whom we are indebted for our reports of 
the Convention, should be employed by this assembly to 
take down their speeches. George Mason opposed it firstly 
as contrary to parliamentary usage, and secondly because he 
believed Robertson to be a Federal partisan and, therefore, 
not likely to do justice to the arguments of the opposition 
members. A correspondent of the Fredericksburg Virginia 
Herald, one of the interested throng of spectators in attend 
ance on the Convention in Richmond, wrote June 2d : 

u It was to-day agitated whether the short-hand gentlemen 
should be suffered to take down the business of the house for 
public information. Opposed by Henry, Mason, Grayson and 
White with success. Mr. Mason rested his opposition upon this 
ground, that these gentlemen were strangers that it was an im 
portant trust for anyone for not only the people at large might 
be misinformed, but a fatal stab might be given to a gentleman of 
the house from a perversion of his language that it was a breach 
of privilege, and had been frequently determined so by the House 
of Commons ; that to show the member who moved the question, 
that his objections proceeded from those principles, and not from 
a wish to be again a member of another Conclave, he had given 
his voice for an adjournment to the Theatre, where, surrounded 
by his countrymen, he would endeavor to speak the language of 
his soul. Mr. Nicholas was up several times upon this subject, 
and had been the first mover of it, but at last relinquished it as 
not tenable." 2 

George Mason refers to this matter of the short-hand 
writer in one of his letters to his son to be given later. The

MASON S APPEARANCE DESCRIBED. 223 



prejudice against reporters lingered long in the House of 
Commons, and was shared, it seems, by these eighteenth- 
century Americans. 

On the 3d of June, after the resolution of Congress on the 
subject of the Constitution, the report of the Federal Con 
vention, and the resolutions of the General Assembly were 
read, George Mason addressed the Convention. Grigsby 
pictures the scene : 

" In an instant the insensible hum of the body was hushed, and 
the eyes of all were fixed upon him. How he appeared that day 
as he rose in that large assemblage, his once raven hair white as 
snow, his stalwart figure, attired in deep mourning, still erect, his 
black eyes fairly flashing forth the flame that burned in his bosom, 
the tones of his voice deliberate and full as when, in the first 
House of Delegates, he sought to sweep from the statute book 
those obliquities which marred the beauty of the young republic, 
or tittered that withering sarcasm which tinges his portrait by the 
hand of Jefferson, we have heard from the lips, and seen reflected 
from the moistened eyes, of trembling age. His reputation as the 
author of the Declaration of Rights and of the first Constitution 
of a free Commonwealth ; as the responsible director of some of 
the leading measures of general legislation during the war and 
after its close ; his position as a prominent member of the Gen 
eral Convention that framed the Constitution, which had been 
adopted under his solemn protest, and his well-known resolve to 
oppose the ratification with all his acknowledged abilities, were 
calculated to arrest attention. He was sixty-two years old, and 
had not been more than twelve years continuously in the public 
councils, but from his entrance into public life he was confessedly 
the first man in every assembly of which he was a member, though 
rarely seen on the floor except on great occasions. But the interest 
with which he was now watched was heightened by another cause. 
From his lips was anxiously awaited by all parties the programme 
of the war which was to be waged against the new system." 

There was a division among the Antifederalists as to the 
line of policy to be pursued. Patrick Henry considered that 
" History of the Virginia Federal Convention," p. 70. 



224 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON, 

the General Convention had usurped powers not bestowed 
upon them in overthrowing the Articles of Confederation, 
George Mason could not take this ground as he had been a 
member of the Convention and approved of the change, 
though he was not satisfied as to the final result. And he 
urged now a discussion of the Constitution, clause by clause, 
before any general previous question be put. He wished for 
a full and free investigation of the subject, since they sought 
to secure, " as far as possible, to the latest generation, the 
happiness and liberty of the people." : This mode of dis 
cussion proved eventually of great disservice to his own 
party, while it helped the Federalists. But as Grigsby says : 

" The main object of Mason was to prevent a premature com 
mittal of the House by a vote on any separate part of the Consti 
tution ; for he well knew that an approval of one part would be 
urged argumentatively to obtain the approval of another part, and 
that, if the Constitution were approved in detail, it would be ap 
proved as a whole ; and so far as his motion postponed immedi 
ate voting, it was wise and well-timed." : 

Yet, to restrict the discussion of the general tendency of 
the Constitution and confine the debate to single clauses gave 
the Federalists an advantage, as the historian of the Conven 
tion points out. However, the Antifederalists, who were 
fully persuaded of the injurious scope of the whole instru 
ment, were not to be restrained from dwelling upon this 
fact. Tyler, in the interests of the opposition, then moved 
that a committee of the whole Convention should take into 
consideration the proposed form of government. Madison 
signified his assent to this arrangement, and George Mason 
moved his resolution, which was agreed to by the Convention. 

Thus was the plan of campaign laid down at the outset 
by the two protagonists of the Convention, Mason and 
Madison. They had waged a Avar of principle in the Fed 
eral Convention which had been merely adjourned, as to 
its final issue, to the soil of their native State. Though the

PROGRAMME OF THE A NTIFEDERALISTS. 22$ 

party of Madison had been the victor in the former assem 
blage, yet was there a good prospect of the amendment 
party triumphing here. Henry Lee, of Westmoreland, 
wished the discussion to begin immediately, but the other 
side was not to be hurried, as many of the members had not 
yet arrived, and both George Mason and Benjamin Harrison 
advocated an adjournment until the next day. On the 4th 
of June the business properly commenced, the Convention 
resolving itself into a committee of the whole, George 
Wythe in the chair. Nicholas, Henry, Randolph, and 
Mason were the four speakers on this day. Edmund Ran 
dolph showed his colors, coming out unequivocally for the 
unamended Constitution, he who had a few months before in 
the Federal Convention declared for amendments and a 
" Second General Convention." Patrick Henry did not fall 
into line immediately with George Mason, but rather over 
stepped the mark, and his first exception to the Constitution 
was taken in somewhat free-lance fashion. He took issue 
with the Federal Convention for changing the character of 
the government " to the utter annihilation of the most 
solemn engagements of the States." There was a con 
federacy of nine States to be formed to the exclusion of the 
other four, and this new confederacy was to form a consoli 
dated government. Henry then made his famous objection 
to the phrase in the preamble, " We, the People," etc. 1 That 
it was understood by the Federal Convention in any " con 
solidated " sense, or as other than a convenient style of ex 
pression for the people of the several States, may be most 
positively denied, or George Mason s jealous ear would have 
been offended, and his voice have been raised against it. 
Since neither Mason nor any other defender of the States in 
the Convention saw fit to oppose the use of this phrase, it is 
apparent that they were quite sure of its harmless nature. 
However, it was to be distorted, as Patrick Henry feared, 
from its obvious signification, and to be used by the party 
of consolidation for their own purposes at a later day. 

" Debates of the Virginia Convention," Robertson, 
vol. ii 15 



226 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



The first and second sections of the first article were 
under consideration. Randolph had spoken after Henry. 
" He was followed," says Grigsby, " by Mason, whose words 
were now watched with an interest hardly exceeded by that 
which existed when he first rose to address the house ; for 
he too had been a member of the General Convention, and 
had declared in that body that, on certain conditions, none 
of which included the words of the preamble, he would 
approve the Constitution ; but though no parliamentarian, 
he saw the snare into which his opponents were anxious 
that he should fall, and adroitly avoided it by taking ground 
which placed him in instant communion with Henry." l He 
maintained that the clause in the second section, " giving 
the first hint of the general government laying direct taxes," 
changed the union into a " national government." He urged 
with great force the danger of leaving the manner of levying 
taxes to those who, in the nature of things, cannot be ac 
quainted with the situation of those on whom they are to 
impose them, when it can be done by those who are well 
acquainted with it. He thought the general government 
should have " the power of demanding their quotas of the 
States, with an alternative of laying direct taxes in case of 
non-compliance." The same sum raised in one way, as he 
declared, would be very oppressive raised in another way. 
The second objection made by Colonel Mason was directed 
against that part of the same section which dealt with repre 
sentation. He did not think it a full and free representation. 
The Constitution did not expressly provide one representa 
tive for every thirty thousand, but it states : " the number of 
representatives shall not exceed one for every 30,000." So it 
might be reduced without violating the letter of the law. 
Colonel Mason concluded with reiterating his objection to 
the taxing power given Congress. With this feature amended, 
this part of the Constitution would receive his sanction, but 
he regarded it as a sine qua 11011? Madison closed the debate 
with a few remarks, reserving a fuller reply to a future occa- 

1 " History of the Virginia Federal Convention." p. 92. ~ Appendix iii. 



MADISON DISPARAGES IIIS OPPONENTS. 22/ 



sion. George Mason does not seem to have spoken in the 
Federal Convention against giving Congress the power of 
direct taxation. He had there urged the clause against 
taxing exports, and further reflection had evidently im 
pressed him with the conviction that the power of Congress 
should be limited, in this matter of revenue, to the duties 
on imposts, as explained in the fourth amendment of the 
Virginia Convention. Madison on the evening of the 4th of 
June wrote an account of the Convention proceedings to 
Washington, which the latter in turn retailed to John Jay a 
few days later. It is evident the course taken by Edmund 
Randolph had greatly elated the Federalists. Madison 
writes disparagingly of his antagonists, Henry and Mason, 
accusing them of making " a lame figure " in the recent 
debate. Still he is by no means confident of the result. 
" Kentucky . . . is supposed to be generally adverse, and 
every kind of address is going on privately to work on the 
local interests and prejudices of that and other quarters." ; 
There were fourteen representatives in the Convention from 
the district of Kentucky. 

Unlike the Federal Convention, which held secret ses 
sions, the Virginia Convention, as has been said, was open 
to the public, and was attended by large crowds of citizens, 
who gave the most eager attention to all that was said. It 
is to be regretted that there were not some fluent scribes 
among these spectators, to write down their impressions of 
the scenes they witnessed, and to preserve for posterity a 
record of the logic and eloquence there manifested. The 
reports of Robertson, as will appear, were not wholly to be 
relied on. And the Federalist Madison writing under the 
excitement of the contest \vas certainly not to be trusted 
in his estimate of the Antifederalist champions opposed to 
him. But with the debates before us, as they have come 
down to our generation, there seems no cause for the Feder 
alists to take any credit to themselves, up to this point of 
time. George Nicholas had advocated the system of repre- 

" Writings of Washington," Sparks, vol. ix., p. 370 (note) and p. 373. 



228 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

sentation, but the ambiguity remained unanswerable, in the 
wording of the provision. Edmund Randolph could only 
put forth in his defence of the Constitution and of himself 
the poor plea of expediency. To the three or four tangi 
ble objections made by the opposition to the first part of 
the Constitution there was as yet no answer given. 

From the 4th of June to the I3th, though still nominally 
employed upon the first and second sections of the first 
article, the Convention in fact diverged widely from the 
point, and discussed the Constitution at large. The great 
speech of the 5th of June was made by Patrick Henry in 
answer to Pendleton and General Henry Lee. He brought 
forward new objections. " How does your trial by jury 
stand ? In civil cases gone not sufficiently secured in 
criminal." He thought also that the militia should not be 
in the hands of Congress. And he dwelt upon the folly of 
looking for subsequent amendments when it was in their 
power to insist upon them beforehand. He quoted from 
the Virginia Bill of Rights, the third article, on the right of 
the people to reform or abolish their government ; the fifth 
article, on taxation ; the sixth article, requiring the consent 
of the people to suspend the laws ; and showed how each 
was endangered by the new Constitution. One phrase here 
is prophetic : " When the people of Virginia at a future day 
shall wish to alter their government, though they should be 
unanimous in this desire, yet they may be prevented there 
from by a despicable minority at the extremity of the United 
States." He objected to giving Congress the control of the 
custom-houses, and also to the inadequate representation of 
the people in that body. Like the other Southern patriots, 
Henry believed that the South would eventually be numeri 
cally stronger than the North, a pathetic illusion as was too 
soon made apparent. The whole scheme of the government 
Henry thought too extravagant, and the President, with 
" the powers of a king," at the head of the army might 
eventually overthrow American liberties. Another specific 
objection advanced by Henry was the control given to Con- 



SPEECH OF PATRICK HENRY. 2 29 



gress over the time, place, and manner of elections. Again 
he denounced the clause concerning the publication of the 
journals " from time to time " only. Without the obligation 
to publish their proceedings, they would be without public 
responsibility. " The Senate, by making treaties, may de 
stroy your liberty and laws for want of responsibility." 
Jay s treaty, a few years later, seemed to many, just such a 
case as was here anticipated. Stevens Thomson Mason, 
who was with Henry now in the Convention, mindful of this 
doctrine of responsibility, which his uncle had also enforced 
in the Federal Convention, was the senator, it will be 
remembered, who gave Jay s treaty to the public prints in 
1795. Patrick Henry concluded his powerful speech by 
beseeching the Convention not to hurry Virginia into an 
acceptance of the proposed government simply because 
eight States had adopted it. They should insist upon its 
being amended, and not fear this bugbear of anarchy that 
\vas suggested. Pennsylvania he thought had been " tricked " 
into adopting the Constitution. " If the other States who 
have adopted it have not been tricked, still they were too 
much hurried into its adoption. There were very respecta 
ble minorities in several of them, and if reports be true, a 
clear majority of the people are averse to it. If we also 
accede, and it should prove grievous, the peace and pros 
perity of our country [Virginia], which we all love, will be 
destroyed." Edmund Randolph made the opening argu 
ment on the following day. He referred to a portion of 
George Mason s speech in these words : " It is objected by 
the honorable gentleman over the way, that a republican 
government is impracticable in an extensive territory, and 
the extent of the United States is urged as a reason for the 
rejection of this Constitution." And he contended that if 
the laws were wisely made and executed, the extent of the 
country would be no bar to the adoption of a " good gov 
ernment." For the definition of a good government, how 
ever, the factor of territory must be taken into account, 

1 " Debates of the Virginia Convention," Robertson, p. 55. 



230 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

George Mason contended. A monarchy, though repugnant 
to the genius of America, might be a good government under 
certain conditions. A republic, to be a good government, 
must be small, and a union of republics should be of a 
marked federal character to make it secure of retaining its 
freedom. There was, of course, no exact prototype of the 
government now proposed, by which the fathers could be 
guided. And the Constitution had its national as well as 
federal features. But Edmund Randolph had objected just 
as strongly as George Mason to the " national " theories of 
Hamilton in the Federal Convention, and it was to bring 
back the Constitution from its deflections out of the orbit 
originally designed for it that amendments were sought for. 
Edmund Randolph in this speech animadverted severely 
upon the legislation of Virginia, meaning that his reflections 
should hit Mason and Henry, who had been prominent as 
its law-makers. George Mason had drafted the first land 
law, and Randolph refers to complaints on this point. 

Madison and George Nicholas were the other speakers at 
this time. Madison at the close of his argument showed how 
little he favored consolidation, though he supported a sys 
tem which came so dangerously near it. He said of the new 
Constitution : " I believe its tendency will be, that the State 
governments will counteract the general interest, and ulti 
mately prevail." His was indeed a short-sighted political 
wisdom, as he lived to discern. Francis Corbin, the young 
member of the legislature of whom George Mason makes 
indulgent mention in his letter from the Assembly given in 
the last chapter, answered Patrick Henry. But in spite of 
Corbin s compliments to the &lt;k declamatory talents " of the 
great orator, Henry appears not to have considered him a 
foeman quite worthy of his steel. And then, too, Patrick 
Henry wished to make the two-sided governor declare him 
self at large, that the opportunity for reprisals might be more 
complete. Lord Chesterfield amused himself with a para 
graph that appeared in one of the London papers relating to

EDMUND RANDOLPH CHANGES SIDES. 2$l 



the health of Charles Townshend, who was proverbial for his 
fickle changes of party : " The Right Honorable Charles 
Townshend has been indisposed of a pain in his side, but it 
is not stated in which side." His Excellency, Governor Ran 
dolph had left the world equally in doubt as to " which 
side " must be understood as that of his intimate convic 
tions, in the struggle going on. Patrick Henry now asked 
him to continue his observations as he wished to hear all that 
could be said in defence of a system he [Henry] found so 
defective. Randolph responded to the invitation, and in the 
course of his remarks, while on the subject of direct taxation, 
he argued against the " expedient, proposed by a gentleman 
whom I do not now see in the house [Mr. George Mason] 
. . . that this power shall be only given to the general 
government, as an alternative after requisitions shall have 
been refused." And again he replied to George Mason, to 
whom he ascribed the observation, " that there could not be 
a fellow-feeling between the national representatives and 
their constituents, and that oppression must be inseparable 
from their exercise of the power of imposing taxes." Madi 
son followed Randolph, with a long speech, making quota 
tions of which Robertson gives only the substance, a plan 
which he follows with a part of the speech itself. Henry 
closed the debate with a comprehensive reply to the argu 
ments of the Federalists, and he took occasion to remind 
" His Excellency " of his former expressions of opinion. He 
indulged in a little excusable irony, and caught up an incau 
tious word of Randolph s on which he dilated, much to his 
victim s discomfiture. Patrick Henry concluded his speech 
with an ultimatum, under three heads, as indispensably 
necessary " : a bill of rights ; a " general positive provision 
securing to the States and the people, every right which was 
not conceded to the general government ; and that every 
implication should be done away." 

The first week of the Convention had closed with Patrick 
Henry s speech of Saturday. On Monday the Qth of June,

232 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



" Henry and Mason, who had, according to their usual habit, 
walked arm in arm from the Swan, were seen to pause a few 
moments at the steps of the Academy, evidently engaged in 
consultation, and with difficulty made their way to their 
seats in the house." The crowd of spectators had increased 
and filled the floor and galleries to overflowing. Henry rose 
to conclude his unfinished argument. He brought forward 
a subject of great interest to all present, the question of the 
Mississippi navigation. Seven States, or the whole North, 
as he said, were willing to relinquish this river which it was to 
the interest of the six Southern States to retain, and under 
the new government the South would be likely to lose it. 
He reviewed the several dangers to which it was asserted 
Virginia would be liable if she did not accept the Constitu 
tion, and showed the fallacy of these assumptions. And he 
expatiated afresh on the objections against it already ad 
vanced. General Henry Lee was the next speaker, and after 
him came the irate governor. The latter poured out the vials 
of his wrath on Patrick Henry, and read a portion of his 
public letter (objecting to the Constitution), to prove that he- 
had not been inconsistent. There was then a little scene 
which must have caused a good deal of excitement in the 
Convention. After Patrick Henry had disavowed any inten 
tion of giving offence, Edmund Randolph made answer, that 
but for this concession "he would have made some men s 
hair stand on end by the disclosure of certain facts." Henry 
asked him to speak if he had anything to disclose, but Ran 
dolph made no reply to this challenge, and proceeded further 
in his own justification, throwing down his letter on the 
clerk s table to lie there " for the inspection of the curious 
and malicious." He continued his argument, after this 
ebullition, and concluded it on the following day. Monroe, 
Marshall, Harrison, and Nicholas were the other speakers on 
the loth, and the ball of debate was tossed back and forth, 
each side reiterating arguments and making citations to 
strengthen its position. Benjamin Harrison was one of the

THE COMMITTEE OF OPPOSITION. 233 

amendment party, but he only spoke in the Convention on 
this one occasion, when he ably seconded the position of 
Mason and Henry. 

It will be seen from Edmund Randolph s remark in his 
speech on Saturday, the /th, that George Mason was not at 
that time in the Convention. It is not unreasonable to 
suppose that his absence from his seat on this day had some 
connection with the arrival in Richmond of Colonel Oswald, 
of Philadelphia, who brought pamphlets and letters from 
the " Federal Republican Society " in New York to the 
leaders of the opposition in the Virginia Convention. Madi 
son reported the news of this portentous event in a letter 
on Monday to his friend and ally, Alexander Hamilton, the 
leader of the Federalists in New York : " Oswald of Phila 
delphia came here on Saturday, and has closet interviews 
with the leaders of the opposition." 1 On the same clay 
Patrick Henry, William Gray son, and George Mason all 
wrote letters to General John Lamb, Chairman of the New 
York Society, to send back by Colonel Oswald. The Anti- 
federalists had not been dilatory in their work of opposi 
tion. They had already formulated in their committee, of 
which Colonel Mason was chairman, a bill of rights, and 
some of the amendments they meant to bring forward in 
the Convention. Patrick Henry wrote to Lamb that four 
fifths of the people in Virginia were opposed to the Consti 
tution, and south of the James River nine tenths : " And 
yet, strange as it may seem, the numbers in Convention 
appear equal on both sides, so that the majority, which way 
soever it goes, will be small. The friends and seekers of 
power have with their usual subtlety wriggled themselves 
into the choice of the people." In regard to General 
Lamb s proposition that they should form in Virginia a 
society like the one in New York, Henry adds : 

"If they [the Federalists] shall carry their point and preclude 
previous amendments, which we have ready to offer, it will be-

come highly necessary to form the society you mention. . . . 
Col. George Mason has agreed to act as chairman of our republi 
can society. His character I need not describe. He is every 
way fit ; and we have concluded to send you by Col. Oswald a 
copy of the bill of rights, and of the particular amendments we 
intend to propose in our Convention." 

William Grayson acknowledges the letter sent him by 
Colonel Oswald, and says he laid it the same evening before 
the " Committee of Opposition," and they had " directed 
their chairman to answer it by Colonel Oswald. Some of our 
proposed amendments," he adds, " are finished in the Com 
mittee ; the others will be forwarded as soon as agreed 
on." He speaks of their affairs as suspended by a hair, and 
that " seven or eight dubious characters, whose opinions are 
not known," will by their decisions decide the important 
question. 2 The following is George Mason s letter to Gen 
eral Lamb : 

RICHMOND, June gth, 1788. 
SIR : 

I have had the honor to receive your letter dated the r8th of 
May, in behalf of the Federal Republican Committee of New 
York, upon the subject of the government proposed by the late 
Convention to the respective States for their adoption, and haye 
communicated it to several respectable gentlemen of the Conven 
tion now met in this city, who are opposed to the adoption 
without previous amendments. They receive with pleasure the 
proposition of your Committee for a free correspondence on the 
subject of amendments, and have requested me to transmit to 
your Committee such as we have agreed on as necessary for 
previous adoption. 

Although there is a general concurrence in the Convention of 
this State that amendments are necessary, yet the members are 
so equally divided with respect to the time and manner of obtain 
ing them, that it cannot now be ascertained whether the majority 
will be on our side or not ; if it should be so I have no doubt 
but that an official communication will immediately take place 
between the Conventions of this State and yours. 

1 " Life and Times of General Lamb," Isaac Q. Leake, p. 306. 2 Ibid. 



GEORGE MASON TO GENERAL JOHN LAMB. 235 

As the amendments proposed by the Convention of Massachu 
setts are the first which have been offered to the public, and con 
tain in them many things that are necessary, it is deemed proper 
to make them the basis of such as may finally be agreed on ; and 
it may also be proper to observe that an Executive Council will 
be necessary, because power and responsibility are two things 
essential to a good executive, the first of which cannot be safely 
given, nor the latter insured where the legislative senate form a 
part of the Executive. The judiciary, the exclusive legislative 
power over the ten miles square, and the militia are subjects to 
which our attention will next be turned, and we shall communi 
cate the result of our deliberations with all possible despatch. 

The nature of the opposition here is such that it has not yet 
taken any particular form, being composed only of members of 
the Convention who meet to prepare such amendments as they 
deem necessary to be offered to the Convention. If it should 
hereafter become necessary to assume one, it is hoped that 
system and order will everywhere appear suitable to the import 
ance and dignity of the cause. In the meantime it is recom 
mended to communicate with you, under cover to Capt. Jacob 
Reed, Junr., of Queen street, New York, in order to prevent any 
interruption that curiosity might give. We approve of the pre 
caution, and also advise that Mr. George Fleming, merchant of 
this city, be made the instrument of safe conveyance on your 
part. 

I have the honor to be, Sir, 

Your most obedient and humble servant, 

G. MASON. 
Honorable John Lamb, Esq : 

Chairman of the Federal Republican Committee 
in New York. 1 

From the 4th to the nth of June, George Mason s voice 
was not heard in the Convention, but he had been busy in 
the Committee of Opposition, preparing the bill of rights 
and amendments. He had left it to Patrick Henry to speak 
for the cause while he was occupied in writing for it. On 
the iith, which was Wednesday, he rose after Madison and 

1 Lamb Papers, New York Historical Society. 



236 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

made a long and careful reply to the arguments of the 
Federalists. Grigsby says here in allusion to the circum 
stance that Mason succeeded Madison : 

" It has been remarked by one of the most celebrated orators 
of the present age, that it is an advantage to a speaker of the first 
order of ability, and to such only, to succeed the delivery of a 
first-rate speech, that the attention of the audience is fixed 
firmly on the subject in debate, and that there is a craving for a 
reply. In this respect, Mason could not have been more for 
tunate, and in another not less so : for the speech which had just 
been delivered was addressed to the reason and not to the 
passions of the House, and the eminent perfection of Mason 
rested on his logical power, in his knowledge of the British pol 
ity, and in his experience as a statesman." 

He remarked first on the propriety at the present juncture 
of discussing the Constitution at large instead of confining 
the debate to a single clause. He maintained that the case 
of Great Britain s representation, as cited by George Nich 
olas, was not applicable to the United States. Yet, he 
asked, in what respect was the American system superior as 
Nicholas declared, when Great Britain with a territory ten 
times smaller had 550 members in Parliament, while the 
United States had but 65 in Congress? He spoke of 
the ineffectiveness of the clause restraining members of 
Congress from holding office. There is a hiatus in the 
report of Mason s speech here, as Robertson says he spoke 
too low to be heard. He is found, however, soon after, to be 
dwelling upon the " unconditional power of taxation " given 
to the government, and fortifying his argument against it by 
examples of its power for evil. He then read a letter of 
Robert Morris to show the sort of taxes that were already 
in agitation. The next point made was the need for a bill 
of rights, as a check to the general government and a safe 
guard to the people of the State, threatened in their reserved 
powers by the second clause of the sixth article. George

TAXATION AND REPRESENTATION. 237 

Mason in speaking of the small representation of Virginia in 
Congress, while advocating the democratic, as opposed to 
the aristocratic theory of representative government, made 
an allusion to the famous phrase of John Adams. He said 
the ten members from Virginia would be chosen, " if not 
wholly, yet mostly from the higher order of the people, 
from the great, the wealthy, the well-born the well-born, 
Mr. Chairman, that aristocratic idol, that flattering idea, that 
exotic plant which has been lately imported from the ports 
of Great Britain, and planted in the luxuriant soil of this 
country." John Adams while in England had written and 
published the first volume of his " Defence of the American 
Constitutions," against the strictures of Turgot. The book 
came out during the session of the Federal Convention, and 
was much read by the members, and was believed to have 
influenced them in favor of a strong central government. 
In the preface and in the conclusion, he seemed to advocate 
a more aristocratic government than suited the romantic 
republicanism of the American patriots of the day. 

George Mason then referred to a statement made by 
Nicholas in regard to the increase of representation : 

" The worthy gentleman says that the number must be 
increased, because representation and taxation are in proportion, 
and that one cannot be increased without increasing the other, 
nor decreased without decreasing the other. Let us examine 
the weight of this argument. If the proportion of each State 
equally and ratably diminishes, the words of the Constitution 
[one for every 30,000] will be as much satisfied as if it had been 
increased in the same manner, without any reduction of the 
taxes. Let us illustrate it familiarly. Virginia has ten repre 
sentatives ; Maryland has six. Virginia will have to pay a sum 
in proportion greater than Maryland, as ten to six. Suppose 
Virginia reduced to five and Maryland to three. The relative 
proportion of money, paid by each, will be the same as before ; 
and yet the honorable gentleman said, that if this did not 
convince us, he would give up. I am one of those unhappy men 
who cannot be amused with assertions. A man from the dead 



238 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

might frighten me ; but I am sure that he could not convince me 
without using better arguments than I have yet heard. The 
same gentleman showed us that though the Northern States had 
a most decided majority against us, yet the increase of popu 
lation among us would, in the course of years, change it in our 
favor. A very sound argument indeed, that we should cheerfully 
burn ourselves to death in hopes of a joyful and happy resurrection ! 

In the course of his remarks, after picturing Holland with 
its free institutions in contrast to Spain in her poverty, he 
added : " They tell us, that if we be powerful and respecta 
ble abroad, we shall have liberty and happiness at home. 
Let us secure that liberty, that happiness first, and we shall 
then be respectable." Then followed another caustic obser 
vation, one of those touches of ironic humor for which the 
speaker was famous : 

" I have some acquaintance with a great many characters who 
favor this government, their connections, their conduct, their 
political principles, and a number of other circumstances. There 
are a great many wise and good men among them. But when I 
look round the number of my acquaintance in Virginia, the 
country wherein I was born, and have lived so many years, and 
observe who are the warmest and the most zealous friends to this 
new government, it makes me think of the story of the cat trans 
formed into a fine lady forgetting her transformation and 
happening to see a rat, she could not restrain herself, but sprang 
upon it out of the chair." 

Of the desirableness of a general government there was 
no doubt, George Mason continued. But, he added : 

" I hope that it is not to the name, but to the blessings of 
union that we are attached. . . . The security of our liberty 
and happiness is the object we ought to have in view in wishing 
to establish the union. If instead of securing these, we endanger 
them, the name of union will be but a trivial consolation." 

Difficulties with Maryland about the Potomac, the western 
lands of Virginia, the magnitude of her debts, were pleas put 



LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE IMPERILLED. 239 



forward by Edmund Randolph as reasons for joining the new 
government. Of the first, George Mason said he could 
speak with authority, having been one of the commissioners 
to form a compact with Maryland, and he knew of no cause 
of alarm there. As to the second, he believed, if the Con 
stitution were to be adopted without amendments, the 
Indiana Company would drive out the settlers between the 
Alleghany and Blue Ridge, though their rights and title 
had been confirmed by the Virginia Assembly. George 
Mason proved to be a prophet here, as to the action of the 
Indiana Company, as they brought suit against Virginia in 
the federal court, after the adoption of the Constitution. Of 
the third plea, Mason said : " And shall we, because involved 
in debts, take less care of our rights and liberties ? Shall we 
abandon them, because we owe money which we cannot 
immediately pay? Will this system enable us to pay our 
debts and lessen our difficulties ? Perhaps the new govern 
ment possesses some secret, some powerful means of turning 
everything to gold. It has been called by one gentleman 
the philosopher s stone. The comparison was a pointed one, 
at least in this, that, on the subject of producing gold they 
will be both equally delusive and fallacious." Colonel 
Mason then proceeded to give Randolph a home thrust on 
the subject of his change of front : 

" My honorable colleague in the late Convention seems to 
raise phantoms, and to show a singular skill in exorcisms, to 
terrify and compel us to take the new government, with all its 
sins and dangers. I know that he once saw as great danger in it 
as I do. What has happened since to alter his opinion ? If any 
thing, I know it not. But the Virginia legislature has occasioned 
it, by postponing the matter. The Convention had met in 
June, instead of March or April. The liberty or misery of 
millions yet unborn are deeply concerned in our decision. When 
this is the case, I cannot imagine that the short period between 
the last of September and first of June ought to make any 
difference." l 

1 Appendix iii. 



240 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

Grigsby explains the story of the cat and the fine lady as 
having reference to a class of men in Virginia favorable to 
the new Constitution, who had been disaffected throughout 
the Revolution, who had " hung on the rear of the friends of 
freedom, and sought to obstruct their progress when they 
could effect their object safely and without suspicion." 
From their high positions and wide family connections it 
was difficult to assailthem, yet Mason had the courage to 
denounce their course. 

Henry Lee of Westmoreland, a gallant and skilful soldier, 
but no match for George Mason in statesmanship, censured 
" the honorable gentleman last up " for his endeavor " to 
draw our attention from the merits of the question, by jocose 
observations and satirical allusions." Grigsby thinks it 
evident from Lee s remarks, that the story of the cat was 
" not the only piece of fun with which Mason relieved one 
of his ablest arguments," but, he adds, " there is not a 
shadow of humor in any other part of the reported speech 
[?]. But to continue General Lee s remarks : u He [Mason] 
ought to know that ridicule is not the test of truth. Does 
he imagine that he that can raise the loudest laugh is the 
soundest reasoner? Sir, the judgments and not the risibility 
of gentlemen are to be consulted." He also found fault 
with Mason for showing the letter of Robert Morris, whose 
proposed scheme of taxation he professed to consider as 
merely the opinion of a private gentleman, though Morris 
was the financial agent of Congress. But the same princi 
ple," he added, " has also governed the gentleman when he 
mentions the expressions of another private gentleman 
t/ic well-born that our federal representatives are to be 
chosen from the higher orders of the people from the well 
born. Is there a single expression like this in the Constitu 
tion ? This insinuation is totally unwarrantable. 
Is it proper that the Constitution should be thus attacked 
with the opinions of every private gentleman ? I hope we 
shall have no more of such groundless assertions. Raising 
a laugh, sir, will not prove the merits, nor expose the defects 



SPEECH OF WILLIAM GRAY SON. 241 

of this system " Evidently the Convention had shown its 
appreciation of Mason s shafts of satire. And they must 
in turn have been amused by this solemn rebuke of his 
levity administered to such a master of sound reasoning as 
George Mason. 

William Grayson made his first speech in the Convention 
at this time, concluding his argument on the following day, 
and his voice was a great accession to the strength of the 
opposition. He too ridiculed the imaginary clangers sug 
gested by Edmund Randolph as the alternative of rejection. 
And he saw evils in a Constitution where the executive was 
" fettered in some parts, and as unlimited in others as a 
Roman dictator," and where there was " an inequality of 
representation and want of responsibility " in the legislature. 
Grayson thought, with Mason and Henry, that the power of 
direct taxation should remain with the States : " Give up 
this and you give up everything, as it is the highest act of 
sovereignty ; surrender up this inestimable jewel, and you 
throw a pearl away richer than all your tribe." And he 
made the prophecy that " this government will operate as a 
faction of seven States to oppress the rest of the Union." 
In the further consideration of this subject Grayson said : 

" An observation came from an honorable gentleman (Mr. 
Mason) when speaking of the propriety of the general govern 
ment exercising this power, that according to the rules and doc 
trine of representation, the thing was entirely impracticable. I 
agreed with him in sentiments. I waited to hear the answer 
from the admirers of the new Constitution. What was the 
answer ? Gentlemen were obliged to give up the point with re 
spect to general uniform taxes. They have the candor to 
acknowledge that taxes on slaves would not affect the Eastern 
States, and that taxes on fish or pot-ash would not affect the 
Southern States. They are then reduced to this dilemma. In 
order to support this part of the system, they are obliged to con 
trovert the first maxims of representation. The best writers on 
this subject, lay it down as a fundamental principle, that he who 
lays a tax, should bear his proportion of paying it."

Vol. II 1 6 



242 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



The other speakers on the I2th were Pendleton and 
Madison for the Constitution and Henry in reply. The lat 
ter said of taxation : " This government subjects everything 
to the Northern majority. Is there not then a settled pur 
pose to check the Southern interest ? We thus put un 
bounded power over our property in hands not having a 
common interest with us." The navigation of the Missis 
sippi was made the theme of discussion for the following 
day. And General Lee, Monroe, Grayson, Henry, Nicholas, 
Randolph, and Corbin all spoke. Mr. Corbin had scarcely 
commenced his speech, however, when a violent storm arose 
which compelled him to close abruptly, and the Convention 
then adjourned for the day. 1 The subject of debate on the 
1 3th was one of great interest, as it affected Virginia and the 
whole South, and as a result of the eloquence and reasoning 
of the Antifederalists, on the danger of losing the Mississippi, 
ten out of the fourteen delegates to the Convention from 
Kentucky voted with the opposition. 2 Theodoric Bland, 
one of the Antifederalists, wrote on this day to Arthur Lee, 
giving an account of the position of parties and of the 
progress of the discussion. Bland was a personal friend of 
George Mason s and there was some correspondence between 
them, doubtless, of which there remains now no record. In 
one of George Mason s letters written in 1791, he alludes to 
the death of his " worthy friend, Col. Bland." The following 
extracts from Theodoric Eland s letter to Lee express the 
sentiments of the Antifederalists at this juncture : 

RICHMOND, June i3th, 1788. 

" DEAR ARTHUR, I was yesterday favored with yours, and 
assure you I am in doubt whether the pleasure or the pain on the 
subject of your congratulation, affects me at this time most 
heavily. On the one hand I see my country on the point of em 
barking and launching into a troubled ocean, without chart or 
compass to direct her ; one half of her crew hoisting sail for the 
land of energy, and the other looking with a longing aspect on the 

1 Ibid., p. 260. * " History of the Virginia Federal Convention," p. 247. 



COLONEL BLAND TO ARTHUR LEE. 243 



shore of liberty. I have but one ray of hope, and that arises from 
an observation that they are yet in perfectly good humour with 
each other. I have as yet sat as a speechless spectator, nor shall 
I be induced to alter that character but as a mediator, and with 
a view of concentrating the two parties now (after twelve days 
session) almost equally divided ; each side boasting by turns of a 
majority of from 3 to 8, on the general question, of adopting or 
rejecting, although I really at this time think there is a decided 
majority for anterior amendments, that is who do not think it 
prudent to mount a high-blooded, fiery steed, without a bridle. 
The amendments which will be proposed will contain simple 
propositions guarding the rights of the States, &c. . . . The 
strongest efforts are made here to inculcate the absolute necessity 
of posterior amendments, or unconditional submission, for fear 
of losing, as it is called, the government, and strong dispositions 
are shown to precipitate the Convention into that measure, but 
hitherto the fear of miscarrying altogether, has restrained the 
gentlemen on the side of the new Constitution. 

"We object not against any powers which shall not be hurtful. 
That the government shall want no aids for its own support or 
execution, provided that such restraints shall be imposed upon it 
as shall support and ensure the State privileges, and the liberty 
of the individual against oppression. We have yet proceeded no 
farther in the discussion than the article of direct taxation, on 
which point they have collected all their force, and I think they 
have left hitherto the advantage considerably on our side." 

Colonel Bland then tells of a duel that had just taken 
place in Richmond, but the principals were not members of 
the Convention. He adds : 

" I mention this to show you that the heats have not yet entered 
that body, although the thunders roll, and the lightnings flash 
every day, both in the natural and political atmosphere. [There 
had been danger of a duel, however, between Henry and Ran 
dolph.] Our chief-magistrate has at length taken his party, and 
appears to be reprobated by the honest of both sides, but this is 
too precious a morsel to be left out. Although lukewarm, he 



244 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



has openly declared for posterior amendments, or in other words, 
unconditional submission." 

On the evening of the I3th Madison wrote his version of 
affairs to Washington, from the standpoint of federalism. 

" Appearances at present are less favorable than at the date of 
my last. Our progress is slow, and every advantage is taken of 
the delay to work on the local prejudices of particular sets of 
members. British debts, the Indiana claim, and the Mississippi 
are the principal topics of private discussion and intrigue, as 
well as of public declamation. . . . The business is in the 
most ticklish state that can be imagined. . . . Oswald of 
Philadelphia has been here with letters for the anti-federal leaders 
from New York, and probably Philadelphia. He staid a very 
short time here during which he was occasionally closeted with 
H-y, M-s-n, &c." 2 

On the 1 4th of June the president was ill and unable to 
attend the Convention, and John Tyler, an Antifederalist, 
was unanimously elected vice-president to preside during 
the inability of the executive officer. The subject of the 
Mississippi was postponed, the Convention deciding to dis 
cuss the Constitution clause by clause. But William Gray- 
son had something to say on the question of the great river 
before the matter was dropped. He thought its possession 
deeply concerned the Southern States. Without it there 
could be no expansion westward. And he reiterated his 
argument as to the " national contest " that is, whether 
one part of the continent should govern the other. " The 
Northern States have the majority and will endeavor to re 
tain it. This is therefore a contest for dominion, for empire. 
I apprehend that God and nature have intended, from the 
extent of territory and fertility of soil, that the weight of 
population should be on this side of the continent. At 
present, for various reasons, it is on the other side." The

third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh sections of the first 
article were read and commented on, Tyler, Monroe, Henry, 
and Grayson urging objections ; Randolph, Nicholas, and 
Madison making reply. After the reading of the eighth 
section George Mason made a speech on the power of Con 
gress over the militia. He wished " such an amendment as 
this that the militia of any State should not be marched 
beyond the limits of the adjoining State ; and if it be neces 
sary to draw them from one end of the continent to the 
other, I wish such a check as the consent of the State legis 
lature to be provided." He was averse to a standing army, 
and thought the militia the safeguard of the state. Congress 
was to have the power to arm and organize the militia, but 
they might neglect to do this, and Colonel Mason wished 
that there should be an express declaration that the State 
governments might arm and discipline them, in case the 
general government neglected this duty. He also thought 
the militia should never be subject to martial law but in time 
of war. 1 The discussion of this subject was continued by 
Madison, Henry, C. Clay, Nicholas, and Randolph. George 
Mason, after reading to the Convention the sixteenth clause 
of this eighth section, maintained "that it included the power 
of annexing punishments, and establishing necessary disci 
pline," and therefore most ignominious punishments might be 
inflicted by Congress, on the worthiest citizens. The speaker 
then reverted to the subject of representation as inadequate, 
which was " a conclusive reason for granting no powers to 
the government, but such as were absolutely indispensable, 
and these to be most cautiously guarded." On the power 
of impeachment, of which he entertained great suspicions, 
he said, " after a treaty manifestly repugnant to the interests 
of the country was made," how was the Senate to be pun 
ished ? " The House of Representatives were to impeach 
them. The senators were to try themselves. If a majority 
of them were guilty of the crime [of bribery and corruption] 
would they pronounce themselves guilty ? Yet this is called

246 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



responsibility." Referring to the ultimate power given 
Congress over elections, he was called to order by George 
Nicholas for leaving the section under discussion, but was 
allowed to proceed : " He was of opinion that the control 
over elections tended to destroy responsibility." He could 
see no good reason for it and thought it was dangerous : 
" I have no power which any other person can take from me. 
I have no right of representation, if they can take it from 
me. I say, therefore, that Congress may, by this claim, take 
away the right of representation, or render it nugatory, 
despicable, or oppressive." After some further argument 
on this point, Colonel Mason took notice of a clause in the 
fifth section, on publishing the proceedings of Congress, and 
he urged that the words " from time to time " should be 
replaced by others less ambiguous. The Confederation had 
provided that their journal should be published monthly, 
with certain exceptions. Here was an additional want of 
responsibility in the new government. In conclusion, Colo 
nel Mason urged that the provision regarding adjournment 
was objectionable. " Neither house can adjourn without 
the consent of the other for more than three days. The 
Senate might have it in their power to worry the House 
into a compliance with their wishes, by refusing to adjourn, 
and they could have no objection to long sessions, as they 
were elected for six years, and would probably make their 
homes in the Federal city." 

The eighth section was still under consideration on Mon 
day, the i6th, and George Mason spoke seven times on this 
day. After a speech by Patrick Henry, Madison answered 
him, and concluded by having the acts of the Assembly 
read, which provided for calling out the militia. Colonel 
Mason asked for what purpose they were read. He thought 
" they militated against the cession of this power to Con 
gress, because the State governments could call forth the 
militia when necessary, so as to compel a submission to the 
laws ; and as they were competent to it, Congress ought not 

1 ibid. 



THE TEN AffLES SQUARE. 247 



to have the power." He was not satisfied with the explana 
tion that General Lee had given of the word organization. 
The latter maintained that it did not include the infliction 
of punishments. Whereas George Mason insisted that 
organizing and disciplining the militia embraced the power 
of inflicting punishments, which might be made severe and 
ignominious. It was said the militia would only be subject 
to martial law when in actual service. But what was there 
to hinder Congress from inflicting it always ? Madison re 
plied, and the subject was discussed by Henry, Corbin, 
Grayson, and Marshall. George Mason said it had been 
asked who were the militia, if they were not the people of 
the country. He thought they did at this time consist of 
the whole people, but they might at some future period be 
confined to the lower and middle classes, under the new 
government. Then ignominious punishments and heavy 
fines might be expected. Discriminating laws might be 
made by Congress exempting its members and others from 
militia duty. George Nicholas professed to find an incon 
sistency in the propositions severally advanced by William 
Grayson and George Mason, and asserted that they both 
opposed the power given Congress on " contradictory prin 
ciples." Mason replied u that he was totally misunderstood. 
The contrast between his friend s objection and his was im 
proper. His friend had mentioned the propriety of having 
select militia, like those of Great Britain, who should be 
more thoroughly exercised than the militia at large could 
possibly be. But hc y himself, had not spoken of a selection 
of militia, but of the exemption of the highest classes of the 
people from militia service ; which would justify apprehen 
sions of some ignominious punishments." The opponents 
of the Constitution all feared the power given Congress over 
the federal district, and George Mason spoke on the subject 
at this time : 

" This ten miles square may set at defiance the laws of the sur 
rounding States, and may, like the custom of the superstitious 
days of our ancestors, become the sanctuary of the blackest 



248 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

crimes. ... If any of their [the Federal government s] officers, 
or creatures should attempt to oppress the people, or should 
actually perpetrate the blackest deed, he has nothing to do but 
get into the ten miles square. . . . It is an incontrovertible 
axiom, that, when the dangers that may arise from the abuse are 
greater than the benefits that may result from the use, the power 
ought to be withheld." 

Such he conceived to be the case here. And, alluding to 
a remark of Edmund Randolph, he added : 

" We are told by the honorable gentleman that Holland has its 
Hague. I confess I am at a loss to know what inference he could 
draw from that observation. This is the place where the deputies 
of the United Provinces meet to transact the public business. 
But I do not recollect that they have any exclusive jurisdiction 
whatever in that place, but are subject to the laws of the province 
in which the Hague is. To what purpose the gentleman men 
tioned that Holland has its Hague I cannot see." 

George Mason thought that Congress should only have 
exclusive power as regarded the police and good govern 
ment of the place. 

Of the last, or " sweeping clause," as it was termed, of the 
eighth section, the Antifederalists had no opinion whatever. 
George Mason replied to Madison and Pendleton on this 
head : " Gentlemen say there is no new power given by this 
clause. Is there anything in this Constitution which secures 
to the States the powers which are said to be retained ? Will 
powers remain to the States which are not expressly guarded 
and reserved " ? He then stated an imaginary case, not an 
impossible one, of oppression arising under powers exercised 
by the federal government, and protests being made by 
public writers against such misgovernment. Could not Con 
gress call this encouraging sedition, and lay restrictions on 
the liberty of the press ? Here Colonel Mason anticipated 
exactly what took place in the sedition law of the second 
administration. As with the liberty of the press, he con 
tinued, so with the trial by jury and other personal rights. 



THE ^SWEEPING CLAUSE." 249 



He then referred to the second of the Articles of Confedera 
tion " reserving to the States respectively every power, juris 
diction, and right, not expressly delegated to the United 
States. This clause has never been complained of, but 
approved by all. Why not, then, have a similar clause in 
this Constitution, in which it is the more indispensably 
necessary than in the Confederation, because of the great 
augmentation of power vested in the former ? " At the con 
clusion of his remarks, Patrick Henry suggested that the 
Bill of Rights be read to the Convention from the eighth to 
the thirteenth article. George Nicholas then spoke in de 
fence of the Constitution as it stood, and was followed in 
reply by Colonel Mason. He still thought the amendment 
he had proposed was necessary. The people of Virginia 
had reserved certain rights when they had formed their 
government, and he asked : 

" Why should it not be so in this Constitution ? Was it because 
we were more substantially represented in it than in the State 
government ? If in the State government, where the people were 
substantially and fully represented, it was necessary that the great 
rights of human nature should be secure from the encroachments 
of the legislature, he asked if it was not more necessary in this gov 
ernment, where they were but inadequately represented ? ... He 
could see no clear distinction between rights relinquished by a 
positive grant, and lost by implication." 

Speeches were then made by Henry, Gray son, and Nicholas. 
George Mason rose to correct Nicholas who had asserted 
that the Virginia Bill of Rights did not prohibit torture, 
whereas, in fact, it was provided against by two clauses. 2 

The ninth and tenth sections of the first article, with the 
first section of the second, were debated on Tuesday the 
i ;th. George Mason was the first to speak after the read 
ing of the first clause ; also after the reading of the second, 
third, and fourth, and again after the fifth and sixth. He 
called this a fatal section, " which has created more dangers

250 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

than any other." He reprobated the clause allowing the 
importation of slaves for twenty years. Yet at the same 
time that the slave-trade was continued, there was no pro 
tection for the slaves already in the country. A tax might 
be laid which would amount to manumission. " So that 
they have done what they ought not to have done, and 
have left undone what they ought to have done. This 
clause was discussed by Madison, Tyler, Henry, and Nicho 
las, when the next three clauses were read and George 
Mason said of the fourth, on the subject of a capitation 
or other direct tax, that it was no restriction. " It only 
meant that the quantum to be raised of each State, should 
be in proportion to their numbers. . . . But the general 
government was not precluded from laying the proportion 
of any particular State on any one species of property they 
might think proper." And by laying heavy taxes on slaves 
they might destroy this property. Madison replied to 
Mason, and after the reading of the fifth and sixth clauses, 
the latter spoke again. He objected to the publication of 
the Treasury accounts " from time to time " only. The ex 
pression was a loose one and might mean any time, monthly 
or once in seven years. It was urged that there might be 
matters which would require secrecy. " But he did not con 
ceive that the receipts and expenditures of the public money 
ought ever to be concealed." And now occurred a second 
little encounter between George Mason and " Light-Horse 
Harry." The latter "thought such trivial arguments, as 
that just used by the honorable gentleman, would have no 
weight with the committee. He conceived the expression to 
be sufficiently explicit and satisfactory," etc., etc. Colonel 
Mason " begged to be permitted to use that mode of argu 
ing to which he had been accustomed. However desirous he 
was of pleasing that worthy gentleman, his duty would not 
give way to that pleasure." After a justification of the clause 
by Nicholas, Corbin, and Madison, George Mason answered, 
" that in the Confederation, the public proceedings were to 
to be published monthly, which was infinitely better than 



EX POST FACTO LAWS. 2s I 



depending on men s virtue to publish them or not, as they 
might please." After the reading of the seventh clause 
Patrick Henry made the first speech, passing in review the 
whole section, which he characterized as the bill of rights of 
the Constitution, or its substitute. And he pointed out how 
far its restrictions fell short of the requirements needed. 
Edmund Randolph replied at considerable length, and 
Henry rejoined that he lamented " that he could not see 
with that perspicuity which other gentlemen were blessed 
with." 

After the reading of the first clause of the tenth section 
Patrick Henry spoke again. Madison made a rejoinder, and 
then George Mason took the floor. Henry had deprecated 
the restrictions on the States that they could not emit bills 
of credit, make anything but gold and silver coin a tender 
in payment of debts, pass ex post facto laws, etc. ; and he 
feared one effect would be that Virginia would have to pay 
for her share of Continental money, shilling for shilling, and 
he asked if there had not been State speculations in this 
matter. George Mason said that both States and individu 
als had speculated enormously. Madison had referred to 
the first clause in the sixth article as protecting the States. 
Mason considered this satisfactory as far as it went ; " that is, 
that the Continental money ought to stand on the same 
ground as it did previously, or that the claim should not be 
impaired. . . . Neither the State legislatures nor Congress 
can make an ex post facto law. The nominal value must 
therefore be paid. . . . The clause under consideration 
does away with the pretended security in the clause which 
was adduced by the honorable gentleman." After speeches 
by Madison, Henry, Nicholas, and Randolph, George Mason 
again addressed the chair, maintaining that though the 
debt was transferred to Congress, they had no means of 
paying it, because they could not pass ex post facto laws. 
" And it would be ex post facto to all intents and pur 
poses to pay off creditors with less than the nominal sum, 
which they were originally promised." He disputed the 



252 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

technical definition of such a law, which Edmund Randolph 
declared related only to criminal cases, whereas it was, 
according to the ordinary use of words, simply a retrospec 
tive law. The federal court would have to decide, and it 
would be their duty to pronounce such laws unconstitu 
tional. He proceeded to mention a remarkable effect this 
Constitution would have. 

" How stood our taxes before this Constitution was introduced ? 
Requisitions were made on the State legislatures, and if they 
were unjust they could be refused. . . . But now this could 
not be done ; for direct taxation is brought home to us. The 
federal officer collects immediately of the planters. When it 
withholds the only possible means of discharging these debts, 
and by direct taxation prevents any opposition to the most enor 
mous and unjust demand, where are you ? Is there a ray of 
hope ? " 

What was here feared from direct taxation has come to pass 
through another form of the power given Congress in the 
eighth section. Experience has proved that indirect taxa 
tion was the more dangerous prerogative. George Mason 
continued. It was said " the United States can be plain 
tiffs, but never defendants. If so it stands on very unjust 
grounds. The United States cannot be come at for anything 
they may owe, but may get what is due to them. There is 
therefore no reciprocity." After Madison had spoken in 
reply to Mason, asserting that the clause was merely declara 
tory, and things existed just as they were before, Mason 
declared himself " still convinced of the rectitude of his 
former opinion. He thought it might be put on a safer 
footing by three words. By continuing the restriction of ex 
post facto laws to crimes, it would then stand under the new 
government as it did under the old." Colonel Mason was 
the first to speak after the reading of the next clause. He 
objected to its restrictions upon the States, as preventing 
Virginia from making " any inspection law but what is sub 
ject to the control and revision of Congress. Hence gentle- 



PRINCIPLE OF RESPONSIBILITY NEGLECTED. 253 

men, who know nothing of the business, will make rules 
concerning it which may be detrimental to our interests. 
. . . Under this clause that incidental revenue which is 
calculated to pay for the inspection, and to defray contin 
gent charges, is to be put into the federal treasury. But if 
any tobacco house is burnt, we cannot make up the loss. I 
conceive this to be unjust and unreasonable. When any 
profit arises from it, it goes into the federal treasury. But 
when there is any loss or deficiency from damage, it cannot 
be made up. Congress are to make regulations for our 
tobacco. Are men in the States where no tobacco is made 
proper judges of this business ? This is one of 

the most wanton powers of the general government." 
George Nicholas defended the clause, and said a tax could 
be laid to make up for the loss of warehouses destroyed by 
fire. Colonel Mason replied " that the State legislatures 
could make no law but what would come within the general 
control given to Congress ; and that the regulation of the 
inspection, and the imposition of duties, must be inseparably 
blended together." George Mason rose after the reading 
of the first section of the second article and expressed his 
unqualified disapprobation of some of its provisions. " The 
great fundamental principle of responsibility in republican 
ism is here sapped." This referred to the election of the 
President without rotation. 

" It may be said that a new election may remove him, and 
place another in his stead. If we judge from the experience of 
all other countries, and even our own, we may conclude that, as 
the President of the United States may be re-elected, so he will. 
. . . This President will be elected time after time ; he will 
be continued in office for life." 

Turning to Edmund Randolph, Colonel Mason continued : 

The honorable gentleman, my colleague in the late Federal 
Convention, mentions with applause those parts of which he had 
expressed his disapprobation. He says not a word. If I am 



254 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

mistaken let me be put right. 1 I shall not make use of his name ; 
but in the course of this investigation I shall use the arguments 
of that gentleman against it." 

The " honorable gentleman " must have writhed under these 
words, and the promise they held out of turning his own 
weapons against him was not reassuring to the time-serving 
governor. The danger of European influence was then 
dwelt upon. George Mason thought " some stated time 
ought to be fixed when the President ought to be reduced to 
a private station," and he advocated eight years of office out 
of twelve or sixteen years. As it was, he might remain in 
office for life. The danger here dreaded may now seem 
chimerical. And public opinion has decided against a third 
term, so that eight years is practically the limit. But none 
the less there remains no constitutional restriction against 
the possible perils inherent in the article under considera 
tion. Edmund Randolph now proceeded to confute his 
former opinions, but George Mason made no further reply 
to him. The latter spoke next on the subject of the Vice- 
President, whom he considered an unnecessary officer. He 
had addressed the Convention twelve times during this day s 
session. 2 

After speeches, on Wednesday, from Monroe and Grayson, 
George Mason discussed the mode of electing the Executive, 
as open to objection : 

" A majority of the whole number of electors is necessary to 
elect the President. It is not the greatest number of votes that is 
required, but a majority of the whole number of electors. If there 
be more than one having such majority, and an equal number, one 
of them is to be chosen by ballot of the House of Representatives. 
But if no one have a majority of the actual number of electors 
appointed, how is he to be chosen ? From the five highest on the 
list, by ballot of the lower house, and the votes to be taken by 

1 The punctuation of this sentence in Robertson is evidently incorrect, and 
has been altered here.

ALL BALANCES DESTROYED. 2$ 5 



States. I conceive he ought to be chosen from the two highest on 
the list. This would be simple and easy. Then indeed the people 
would have some agency in the election. But when it is extended 
to the five highest, a person having a very small number of votes 
may be elected." 

And in regard to the second section of the article on the 
Executive, George Mason said : 

" It has been wittily observed that the Constitution has married 
the President and the Senate has made them man and wife. I 
believe the consequence that generally results from marriage will 
happen here. They will be continually supporting and aiding 
each other ; they will always consider their interest as united. 
. . . The executive and legislative powers thus connected will 
destroy all balances ; this would have been prevented by a consti 
tutional council, to aid the President in the discharge of his office, 
vesting the Senate, at the same time, with the power of impeaching 
them." 

Madison in his reply took issue with Mason on the construc 
tion of the phrase, " majority of the whole number of electors 
appointed." However, the present mode of electing the Ex 
ecutive, by special conventions, the electoral college simply 
registering the result of the vote on the nominees of the 
conventions, is a wide departure in practice from the theory 
contemplated by the Constitution. 

George Mason was the first to speak after the reading of 
the first clause of the second section of article second. He 
was alarmed at the great powers given the President. That 
of commanding the army in person he thought very danger 
ous. He believed a general superintendence was sufficient, 
and he took occasion to remark on the virtues and magna 
nimity of Washington, who, had he been ambitious, might 
have done much harm to the country: " So disinterested and 
amiable a character as General Washington might never 
command again." He thought the President should not 
have the pardoning power. General Lcc said the President 
would not necessarily command in person and might only do 



256 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

so in case he was a military man and the public safety 
required it. To this Mason retorted, that the President 
might command if he pleased, and might make a dangerous 
use of his power. George Nicholas compared the State and 
federal governments, in the power of the former over the 
militia and the latter over the army and navy, and George 
Mason replied that " the Governor did not possess such ex 
tensive powers as the President, and had no influence over 
the navy. The liberty of the people had been destroyed by 
those who were military commanders only. The danger here 
was greater by the junction of great civil powers to the com 
mand of the army and fleet." Madison animadverted upon 
Mason s objection to giving the Executive the pardoning 
power, and said that it would not be proper to vest it in the 
House of Representatives, because large popular bodies were 
more apt to be swayed by passion. He instanced the case of 
Massachusetts and Shay s Rebellion, where the same legisla 
ture at different sessions were actuated by exactly opposite 
sentiments. To this Colonel Mason answered that " they [the 
Assemblies] were both right ; for in the first instance, when 
such ideas of severity prevailed, a rebellion was in existence, 
in such circumstance it was right to be rigid. But after it 
was over, it would be wrong to exercise unnecessary severity." 
The second clause was read, and George Mason was again on 
his feet, objecting to this most dangerous provision, " as 
thereby five States might make a treaty, ten Senators, the 
representatives of five States being two-thirds of a quorum. 
These ten might come from the five smallest States." George 
Nicholas answered Colonel Mason, but the latter was not pre 
pared to agree with him in his argument as to the superiority 
of the Constitution over the Confederation on this point. 
The subject was discussed for some time longer, both Henry 
and Grayson, among others, making speeches on this question 
of the treaty power. On Thursday, the iQth, after Grayson 
and Nicholas had spoken, George Mason continued his 
remarks on the same topic. He considered this as " one of 
the greatest acts of sovereignty," and thought it should be

most carefully guarded. As it was, the President had more 
power than the King of England. " Could the King give 
Portsmouth to France? He could not do this without an 
express act of Parliament without the consent of the legis 
lature in all its branches. There are other things which the 
King cannot do, which may be done by the President and 
Senate in this case." The common law of England, he said, 
was not the common law of this country. And there was 
nothing in the Constitution to prevent the relinquishment of 
territory by treaty. " No treaty to dismember the empire, 
ought to be made without the consent of three-fourths of the 
legislature in all its branches." And only unavoidable neces 
sity could excuse such a treaty when it would doubtless have 
the " general and uniform vote of the Continental Parlia- 

o 

ment." l Corbin, Henry, and Madison all spoke on this 
occasion ; the former exhibiting, as Grigsby says, " great 
perspicacity in anticipating the real action of the Federal 
Government," in regard to treaties. 2

CHAPTER VIII. 

AN ANTIFEDERALIST LEADER. 
1788. 

The Convention had now reached, Thursday the iQth of 
June, a most important part of the Constitution the first 
and second sections of the third article, on the federal judi 
ciary. It was a theme, says the historian of the Convention, 
" which, in itself considered, possessed an importance in the 
eyes of our fathers that language would vainly attempt to 
measure, which was discussed with a fulness of learning, 
with a keenness of logic, and with a glow of eloquence that 
it might well elicit, and which, though technical, and seen 
through a vista of seventy [now a hundred] years, cannot 
fail to strike a responsive chord in the hearts of every true 
son and daughter of our noble Commonwealth." And it 
possessed an additional interest as it was to be " the last 
battle-ground of the parties into which the Convention 
was in nearly equal portions divided." Grigsby reminds 
us that the experience of a century " will place a child 
apparently on the same level with a giant, and the merest 
tyro in politics with a Somers or a Mason," and he adds 
" that the fears and gloomy predictions uttered by the oppo 
nents of the Constitution have, by the vigilance and caution 
which they inspired, operated in a material degree in pre 
venting their own fulfilment." Edmund Pendleton having 
first spoken, in favor of the proposed system, Colonel 
Mason said he had hoped the friends of the Constitution 

1 Grigsby s " History of the Virginia Federal Convention," p. 276. 



&lt;&gt; TA TE GO VERNMEN TS A ND J UDICIA RIES. 259 

would have had the candor to point out the objections that 
must be apparent to all. " It is with great reluctance," he 
added, " I speak of this department, as it lies out of my line. 
I should not tell my sentiments upon it, did I not conceive 
it to be so constructed as to destroy the dearest rights of 
the community." He asked what power remained to the 
State courts. He could see no limitation to the power of 
the federal courts, and Congress might establish any num 
ber of them ; while the discrimination between their juris 
diction and that of the State courts existed only in name. 

" To what disgraceful and dangerous length does the principle 
of this go ! For if your State judiciaries are not to be trusted 
with the administration of common justice, and decision of dis 
putes respecting property between man and man, much less 
ought the State governments to be trusted with power of legis 
lation. The principle itself goes to the destruction of the legis 
lation of the States, whether or not it was intended. As to my 
own opinion, I most religiously and conscientiously believe that 
it was intended, though I am not absolutely certain. But I 
think it will destroy the State governments, whatever may have 
been the intention. There are many gentlemen in the United 
States who think it right, that we should have one great, national, 
consolidated government, and that it was better to bring it about 
slowly and imperceptibly rather than all at once. This is no 
reflection on any man, for I mean none. To those who think 
that one national, consolidated government is best for America, 
this extensive, judicial authority will be agreeable ; but I hope 
there are many in this Convention of a different opinion, and who 
see their political happiness resting on their State governments." 

Though George Mason had said he meant no reflection 
on any man, there was one member of the Convention who 
could not but consider his remarks as personal. Madison 
alone of those present who had been delegates to the Fed 
eral Convention felt a responsibility for its work. Randolph 
had changed sides, and George Wythe, though voting with 
the Federalists on that occasion, had taken no conspicuous 



260 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

part in the matter. Then, too, Madison was now hand in 
glove with Alexander Hamilton, whose views were well 
known to be inimical to State sovereignty. These two were 
at this time writing the letters of The Federalist for the 
enlightenment of the general public, while carrying on an 
anxious private correspondence, in which their sympathy is 
seen to be complete on the subject of adopting the un- 
amended Constitution. Madison, therefore, interrupted 
Colonel Mason, and asked for " an unequivocal explana 
tion." To this challenge Mason made reply : 

" I shall never refuse to explain myself. It is notorious that 
this is a prevailing principle. It was at least the opinion of 
many gentlemen in Convention, and many in the United States. 
I do not know what explanation the honorable gentleman asks. 
I can say, with great truth, that the honorable gentleman, in 
private conversation with me, expressed himself against it ; 
neither did I ever hear any of the delegates from this State 
advocate it." 

With this explanation Madison professed himself satisfied, 
and George Mason continued his argument. He passed in 
review the powers given the judiciary, approving of some 
unconditionally, of others under restrictions, but excepting 
to some altogether as " utterly inconsistent with reason and 
good policy." He dwelt upon the hardships and expense to 
a poor man in case of oppression by federal officials. 

" Even suppose the poor man should be able to obtain judg 
ment in the inferior court, for the greatest injury, what justice 
can he get on appeal ? Can he go four hundred or five hundred 
miles ? Can he stand the expense attending it ? On this occa 
sion they are to judge of fact as well as law. He must bring his 
witnesses where he is not known, where a new evidence may be 
brought against him, of w r hich he never heard before, and which 
he cannot contradict." 

While admitting that in maritime and chancery cases 
jurisdiction as to fact was necessary, he thought in common- 



UNLIMITED POWER OF FEDERAL COURTS. 261 

law controversies it was inexpedient and dangerous. And 
he proposed an amendment, which is to be found as corre 
sponding to the first part of the fourteenth amendment 
adopted by the Convention. In regard to controversies 
between citizens of different States, Colonel Mason said : 

" Can we not trust our State courts with the decision of these ? 
If I have a controversy with a man in Maryland if a man in 
Maryland has my bond for ^100, are not the State courts com 
petent to try it ? Is it suspected that they would enforce the 
payment if unjust, or refuse to enforce it if just ? The very idea 
is ridiculous." 

He dilated further upon this case, and then proceeded to 
consider that of the British creditor and the citizens of Vir 
ginia, and he thought there were many instances where the 
federal courts could oblige the latter to pay a debt twice 
over. Again, in regard to disputed lands he saw peril to 
many in the community. " I am personally endangered," 
he went on to say, " as an inhabitant of the Northern Neck. 
The people of that part will be obliged, by the operation of 
this power, to pay the quitrent of their lands. . . . Lord 
Fairfax s title was clear and undisputed. After the Revolu 
tion, we taxed his lands as private property. After his death, 
an act of Assembly was made, in 1782, to sequester the quit- 
rents due, at his death, in the hands of his debtors. Next 
year an act was made restoring them to the executor of the 
proprietor. Subsequent to this, the treaty of peace was 
made, by which it was agreed that there should be no 
further confiscations. But after this an act of Assembly 
passed confiscating this whole property. As Lord Fairfax s 
title was indisputably good, and as treaties are to be the 
supreme law of the land, will not his representatives be able 
to recover all in the federal court ? " Next he named the 
great land companies, who would now come forward : 

" All that tract of country between the Blue Ridge and the 
Alleghany Mountains, will be claimed, and probably recovered in 



262 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

the federal court, from the present possessors, by those companies 
who have a title to them. . . . Again, the great Indiana 
purchase, which was made to the westward, will, by this judicial 
power, be rendered a cause of dispute. . . . Three or four 
counties are settled on the land to which that company claims a 
title, and have long enjoyed it peaceably. All these claims 
before those courts, if they succeed, will introduce a" scene of 
distress and confusion never heard of before. Our peasants will 
be, like those mentioned by Virgil, reduced to ruin and misery, 
driven from their farms, and obliged to leave their country 
Nos patriam fugimus, et dulcia linquimus arva" 

George Mason then proposed an amendment, " that the 
judicial power shall extend to no case where the cause of 
action shall have originated before the ratification of this 
Constitution, except in suits for debts due to the United 
States, disputes between States about their territory, and 
disputes between persons claiming lands under the grants of 
different States." This forms the concluding clause of the 
fourteenth amendment recommended by the Convention. 

Grigsby observes that " Madison manifested great sensi 
tiveness during the speech of Mason, and it is not to be 
disguised that he did touch doctrines in the [Federal] Con 
vention which would have led the way to the plan denounced 
by Mason ; for he is reported by Yates to have said that the 
States were never sovereign, and were petty corporations." * 
Though it was past the hour for adjournment, Madison rose 
to reply to Mason " to break the effect " of his speech. And 
on the following day Madison continued his argument. 
" There was an evident interest shown," says Grigsby, " to 
hear the speech of Madison, who, like Mason, was not a 
lawyer, on a topic which was beyond the usual sphere of a 
politician, and which had been argued with such eminent 
ability by Mason the day before." Patrick Henry spoke 
in reply to Madison, and he was followed by Pendleton, who 

1 Appendix iii. 

* " History of the Virginia Federal Convention," note to p. 285. 

3 Ibid., p. 290. 



PENDLETON AND MARSHALL ANSWER MASON. 263 



sought to refute the arguments of Mason and Henry. He 
accused George Mason of making a mistake in his speech 
" on the propriety of a jury from the vicinage." Grigsby 
comments here : 

" Pendleton sought to make mirth with those gentlemen of the 
law in the Convention who thought that none but lawyers can 
understand legal questions. The fact is that Mason was clearly 
right, and Pendleton clearly wrong. Mason did not contend 
that a jury from the vicinage was the sole benefit accruing from 
jury trial, but that it was an important one, as it assuredly is, 
which a criminal, carried a thousand miles from his home would 
lose. As Pendleton wholly excludes from his view this great 
benefit, it is he that errs, and not Mason." 1 

Pendleton also referred to the case supposed by Mason, 
that a Virginian holding his bond might, through malice, 
assign it to a citizen of a neighboring State, and asserted 
that this was not a well-founded objection. Colonel Mason 
replied : 

" The honorable gentleman has said that there can be no 
danger in the first instance because it is not within the original 
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court ; but that the suit must be 
brought in the inferior federal court of Virginia. He supposes 
there can never be an appeal, in this case, by the plaintiff, 
because he gets a judgment on his bond ; and that the defendant 
alone can appeal, who therefore, instead of being injured, obtains 
a privilege. Permit me to examine the force of this." 

And the speaker proceeded to show that his objection was 
a legitimate one, and he added : " The honorable gentle 
man recommends to me to alter my proposed amendment. 
I would as soon take the advice of that gentleman as any 
other, but though the regard which I have for him be great, 
I cannot assent on this great occasion." Marshall occupied 
the attention of the house for the remainder of the day s 
session. He passed in review some of George Mason s 

1 Ibid., note to p. 294. 



264 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

objections to the great powers given the judiciary, and 
pronounced them chimerical. Mason had said of the clause, 
" to controversies between a State and the citizens of an 
other State," in reference to the land companies, that these 
claims would be tried before a federal court : 

" Is not this disgraceful ? Is this State to be brought to the 
bar of justice like a delinquent individual ? Is the sovereignty 
of the State to be arraigned like a culprit, or private offender ? 
. . . What is to be done if a judgment be obtained against a 
State ? Will you issue a fieri facias ? It would be ludicrous to 
say you could put the State s body in jail. How is the judgment, 
then, to be enforced ? A power which cannot be exercised ought 
not to be granted." 

And Marshall replied : " / hope no gentleman will think 
that a State will be called at the bar of the federal court." 
Later events justified George Mason s fears, and necessitated 
the eleventh amendment. Edmund Randolph had a few 
remarks to make on Friday, to the effect " that the faults 
which he once saw in this system he still perceived ! " He 
unfolded his views on the following day, after an able speech 
by Grayson. " It seems to have been a rule," said the latter, 
" with the gentlemen on the other side, to argue from the 
excellency of human nature, in order to induce us to grant 
away (if I may be allowed the expression) the rights and 
liberties of our country. I make no doubt the same argu 
ments were used on a variety of occasions. I suppose, sir, 
this argument was used when Cromwell was invested with 
power. The same argument was used to gain our assent to 
the stamp act." 

Madison wrote to Alexander Hamilton on Friday the 
2Oth, and also on Sunday the 22d. He spoke of the debates 
having " advanced as far as the judiciary department, 
against which a great effort is making." He referred to the 
project of the Antifederalists to bring forward a bill of 
rights and amendments as conditions of ratification. 

1 " Debates of the Virginia Convention," Robertson, p. 402. Appendix iii. 



MADISON WRITES TO ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 26$ 

" The plan meditated by the friends of the Constitution is to 
preface the ratification with some plain and general truths that 
cannot affect the validity of the act, and to subjoin a recommen 
dation, which may hold up amendments as objects to be pursued 
in the constitutional mode. These expedients are rendered pru 
dent by the nice balance of numbers, and the scruples entertained 
by some who are in general well affected." 

He was by no means sure of a majority, however, and 
he adds : 

" It unluckily happens, that our legislature, which meets at this 
place to-morrow, consists of a considerable majority of Anti- 
federal members. This is another circumstance that ought to 
check our confidence. As individuals they may have some influ 
ence ; and as coming immediately from the people at large they 
can give any color they please to the popular sentiments at this 
moment, and may in that mode throw a bias on the representa 
tives of the people in Convention." 

The last week of the Convention opened inauspiciously 
for the needs of the future historian, as on this day, Monday 
the 23d, the short-hand writer was absent, and only very 
incomplete notes of the speeches were preserved. George 
Mason spoke four times on the 23d, and made his last 
heroic efforts to procure amendments. Only once again 
was his voice heard in the Convention, when on the 24th he 
rose to correct an erroneous statement made by Edmund 
Randolph. On the 236 the first and second sections of the 
third article were still under consideration. George Nicholas 
urged that the Convention proceed to the next section, but 
Henry did not consider the objections of the opposition had 
been answered in a manner to give satisfaction. He called 
in question a statement of Marshall s, relating to the trial by 
jury, which the latter rose to explain, declaring that it was 
as well secured in the Constitution as in the Virginia Bill of 
Rights. Henry replied to this at considerable length. George 
Nicholas made the succeeding speech (after Stephen), and 

1 " Works of Hamilton," John C. Hamilton, vol. i., p. 462. 



266 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

in the course of his remarks gave offence to Patrick Henry. 
The atmospheric conditions were not favorable to coolness 
of temper, either in- or out-of-doors, and the crisis of political 
excitement had been reached, probably, on this day, with 
the members of the Assembly, as they arrived in Richmond, 
swelling the eager audience, too much interested in the 
work of the Convention to organize their own Houses. 
The president, after some heated discussion between 
Nicholas and Henry, observed, " that he hoped gentlemen 
would not be personal, that they would proceed to investi 
gate the subject calmly and in a peaceable manner." After 
speeches by Monroe, Madison, Grayson, and Henry, of 
which we have only the outlines, George Mason spoke in 
conclusion, on the judiciary. With respect to concurrent 
jurisdiction," said Mason in reply to Madison, who had 
observed " that county courts had exercised this right with 
out complaint," the argument adduced seemed to him very 
unsatisfactory: 

" Have Hanover and Henrico the same objects ? Can an 
officer in either of those counties serve a process in the other ? 
The federal judiciary has concurrent jurisdiction throughout 
the States, and therefore must interfere with the State judiciaries. 

. . If we were forming a general government, and not 
States, I think we should perfectly comply with the genius of the 
paper before you ; but if we mean to form one great national 
government for thirteen States, the arguments which I have 
heard hitherto in support of this part of the plan do not apply at 
all. We are willing to give up all powers which are necessary to 
preserve the peace of the Union, so far as respects foreign 
nations, or our own preservation, but we will not agree to a 
federal judiciary, which is not necessary for this purpose, 
because the powers there granted will tend to oppress the 
middling and lower class of people." 

After further discussion of this point, Colonel Mason sat 
down, to rise again on the reading of the first section of the 
fourth article. He professed not to understand the latter 



MASQAT S FINAL APPEAL AND WARNING. 267 



part of this clause : "Full faith and credit shall be given to 
all acts ; and how far it may be proper that Congress shall 
declare the effects, I cannot clearly see into." After the 
reading of the second section, George Mason spoke again. 
He reverted to observations made at an earlier stage in 
their proceedings, " on the security of property coming 
within this section." He thought then and he was still 
convinced that there was no security. 1 " More than sixty 
years after this remark was made by Mason," says Grigsby, 
" one of his grandsons in the Senate of the United States 
drew up an act to carry this clause of the Constitution into 
effect." And he adds : " If it had been objected to the first 
clause of this section, that a Southern gentleman could not 
travel with his servants through another State without 
having them forcibly taken from him, or in transitu to some 
other State, the friends of the Constitution would have 
answered that from their own experience no such result 
would ever follow." 2 

William Grayson was the first to speak after the reading 
of the third section, which in its first clause related to the 
admission of new States, and in its second clause to the 
jurisdiction of Congress over federal territory. Grayson 
foretold the difficulty there would be in admitting new 
Southern States into the Union, with a Northern majority 
against them. George Mason here made his last speech in 
the Convention. But unfortunately no report of it can be 
said to be extant. The meagre record published by Robert 
son gives us only a faint reflex of its scope and purpose. 
He " took a retrospective view of several parts [of the Con 
stitution] which had been before objected to. He endeav 
ored to demonstrate the dangers that must inevitably arise 
from the insecurity of our rights and privileges, as they 
depended on vague, indefinite, and ambiguous implications. 
The adoption of a system so replete with defects, he appre 
hended could not but be productive of the most alarming 

1 Appendix iii. 
" History of the Virginia Federal Convention," note to p. 304. 



268 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

consequences. He dreaded popular resistance to its opera 
tion. He expressed, in emphatic terms, the dread fid effects 
which must ensue, should the people resist ; and concluded 
by observing, that he trusted gentlemen would pause before 
they would decide a question which involved such awful 
consequences." Such is the brief synopsis of this final ap 
peal. The eloquence and earnestness of the speaker are 
barely suggested to us, not in anywise reproduced. But 
their effect on his hearers was evidently not slight. Some 
intimation of this may be gathered from the speech of Gen 
eral Henry Lee, which followed Mason s, in which the 
federal advocate sought to do away with the impression his 
opponent had made. 1 We learn, too, what Madison thought 
of George Mason s speech, through a letter written by him 
to Washington, on the evening of the 23d. Unfortunately 
no report from the lips of friends remains to supplement the 
unsympathetic relation of political adversaries. But Madison s 
letter is important as filling out, to some extent, the abbre 
viated journal of the day s proceedings. And we learn in it 
that Mason was answered by others beside Lee, and that 
George Mason concluded his arraignment of the Constitu 
tion, and his forecast of its perils, by " declaring his deter 
mination, for himself, to acquiesce in the event, whatever it 
might be." Madison wrote to his friend : 

" We got through the Constitution by paragraphs to-day. . . . 
The opposition will urge previous amendments. Their conversa 
tion to-day seemed to betray despair. Colonel Mason, in par 
ticular, talked in a style which no other sentiment could have 
produced. He held out the idea of civil convulsions as the 
effect of obtruding the government on the people. He was an 
swered by several, and concluded with declaring his determina 
tion, for himself, to acquiesce in the event, whatever it might be. 
Mr. Henry endeavored to gloss what had fallen from his friend ; 
declared his aversion to the Constitution to be such that he could 
not take the oath ; but he would remain in peaceable submission 
to the result." 2

REQUIREMENTS OF THE ANTIFEDERAL1STS. 269 

On the 24th, George Wythe proposed a resolution of rati 
fication, and that amendments should be recommended to 
Congress on its first session under the Constitution. Henry 
declared the motion premature, and after a speech of some 
length he informed the committee that he had a resolution 
prepared, to refer a declaration of rights, with certain 
amendments to the most exceptionable parts of the Consti 
tution, to the other States in the Confederacy, for their con 
sideration, previous to ratification. These were nearly the 
same, Robertson says, as the amendments ultimately passed 
by the Convention. And there is every reason to believe 
that, though presented by Patrick Henry, they were written 
by George Mason, the chairman of the Committee of Op 
position, and a transcript of them is preserved among George 
Mason s papers. 1 Edmund Randolph spoke after Henry, 
and commented on Wythe s form of ratification, declaring 
it sufficient, as a declaration of rights. He also passed in 
review the various amendments proposed by Henry. In 
regard to the seventh and eighth, he said : 

" I have never hesitated to acknowledge that I wished the 
regulation of commerce had been put in the hands of a 
greater body than it is in the sense of the Constitution. But I 
appeal to my colleagues in the Federal Convention, whether 
this was not a sine qua non of the Union." 

To this George Mason replied : 

" It never was, nor in my opinion ever will be, a sine qua non 
of the Union. I will give you, to the best of my recollection, the 
history of that affair. This business was discussed at Phila 
delphia for four months, during which time the subject of com 
merce and navigation was often under consideration ; and I 
assert, that eight States out of twelve, for more than three 
months, voted for requiring two-thirds of the members present 
in each House to pass commercial and navigation laws. ... If 
I am right, there was a great majority for requiring two-thirds of 
the States in this business, till a compromise took place between 

1 Appendix iv. 



2/O LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

the Northern and Southern States ; the Northern States agreeing 
to the temporary importation of slaves, and the Southern States 
conceding, in return, that navigation and commercial laws should 
be on the footing on which they now stand. . . . These are 
my reasons for saying that this was not a sine qua non of their 
concurrence." l 

George Mason was followed by John Dawson, a young 
member of the opposition, who addressed the Convention 
now for the first time. To him succeeded Grayson, Madi 
son, and Henry. The latter made that memorable appeal to 
his hearers which Wirt has so graphically described, where, 
as it was said, he seemed to look beyond the horizon, to the 
"beings of a higher order," who were witnesses of the im 
portant work then about to be consummated in behalf of 
posterity, and as he thrilled his auditors with his eloquence, 
a thunder-storm mingled its turbulence with the human 
emotions the orator had aroused, bringing the scene to a 
dramatic conclusion. 

The next day, Wednesday, was the last day of the Con 
vention. Innes, the eminent lawyer, spoke then for the first 
time, bringing all his powers of intellect to bear in favor of 
the new government ; while the clear-headed, conservative 
Tyler answered him in a zealous plea for the liberties 
of the States. Other speeches were made by less prominent 
members, Patrick Henry and Edmund Randolph closing the 
debate. The latter made a solemn justification of himself 
for the benefit of " some future annalist." The vote was 
then taken on a resolution for previous amendments, and 
it passed in the negative, eighty to eighty-eight. The reso 
lution of ratification with subsequent amendments passed in 
the affirmative, eighty-nine for it and seventy-nine against it. 
Two more days were taken up with the work of preparing 
and voting on the form of ratification and amendments. 
Though the committee named to prepare the form of ratifi 
cation was a purely Federalist one, consisting of Randolph, 

" Debates of the Virginia Convention," Robertson. Appendix iii. 



THE CONSTITUTION RATIFIED. 2/1 



Nicholas, Madison, Marshall, and Corbin, yet they stated in 
unmistakable terms the doctrine of State sovereignty in 
the assertion that the " powers granted under the Consti 
tution, being derived from the people of the United States, 
may be resumed by them whensoever the same shall be per 
verted to their injury or oppression." The "people" here 
meant precisely what it meant in the preamble to the Con 
stitution as expounded by Madison, " not the people as 
composing one great body, but the people as composing 
thirteen sovereignties." Virginia here declares the right of 
secession, as a correlative of accession, for all of the thirteen 
sovereignties. The committee to prepare amendments con 
sisted of the prominent members of both parties, including 
on the one side Mason, Henry, and Grayson, and on the 
other Madison, Marshall, and Edmund Randolph. George 
Wythe, as chairman of this committee, reported a bill of 
rights and amendments on the 27th. There were twenty ar 
ticles in the former paper, and twenty amendments proposed, 
and they correspond in substance, with one or two excep 
tions, to those agreed on by the Committee of Opposition, 
as may be seen by comparing them with the drafts among 
George Mason s papers. The Convention adjourned on the 
27th of June. The hard-fought battle was over, but the 
victory was not altogether with the Federalists. They had 
been forced to concede most of the amendments they had 
so strenuously opposed, though they were not made a con 
dition precedent to ratification. The Convention had 
pledged its delegates to the first Congress under the new 
government to recommend to its consideration the objections 
of the Antifederalists and their amendments ; the latter to 
be acted upon as the Constitution required. The expedi 
ency plea put forward by Edmund Randolph, that it was a 
question of " union or no union," as eight States had al 
ready ratified the compact, no doubt had its effect on the 
weak and the wavering in the Convention, and brought over 
the small majority to the Federalists. 

Madison wrote to Jefferson on the 2.d.th of July from New 



2/2 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

York, where he had gone to attend Congress, telling his 
correspondent of the last days of the Convention in Virginia. 
He anticipates no " irregular opposition to the system." He 
adds : 

"What local eruptions may be occasioned by ill-timed or rigor 
ous executions of the treaty of peace against British debts, I will 
not pretend to say. But although the leaders, particularly Henry 
and Mason, will give no countenance to popular violence, it is not 
to be inferred that they are reconciled to the event, or will give 
it a positive support. On the contrary, both of them declared 
they could not go that length, and an attempt was made under 
their auspices to induce the minority to sign an address to the 
people, which if it had not been defeated by the general modera 
tion of the party, would probably have done mischief. Among a 
variety of expedients employed by the opponents to gain prose 
lytes, Mr. Henry first, and after him Col. Mason, introduced the 
opinions expressed in a letter from you to a correspondent (Mr. 
Donald or Skipwith I believe) and endeavored to turn the influ 
ence of your name even against parts of which I knew you ap 
proved." l 

Jefferson had written that he wished for a bill of rights 
and amendments. And he had made the suggestion that 
the object could be obtained in this way; the nine first Con- 
ventions by adopting the Constitution would secure the 
good that it contained, and the four latest Conventions, 
whichever they might be, by refusing to accede to it until 
amendments were secured, would force the others to assent 
to them. Patrick Henry, and it seemed George Mason also, 
though of this Robertson gives us no intimation, very natu 
rally counting Jefferson among the Antifederalists, had 
sought to secure in the Convention any strength that might 
be obtained by bringing forward his views. But, as Henry 
pointed out, Jefferson s advice could not be followed, unless 
they were certain as to the course of the New Hampshire 
Convention then in session : " They tell us," said Henry, in 

1 "Writings of Madison," vol. i., p. 405. 



POLICY SUGGESTED BY JEFFERSON. 2/3 

a speech made the I2th of June, " that from the most au 
thentic accounts, New Hampshire will adopt it [the Consti 
tution]. Where then will four States be found to reject it, 
if we adopt it ? Do not gentlemen see, that if we adopt, 
under the idea of following Mr. Jefferson s opinion, we 
amuse ourselves with the shadow, while the substance is 
given away ? If Virginia be for adoption, what States will 
be left, of sufficient respectability and importance, to secure 
amendments by their rejection ? " As New Hampshire 
adopted the Constitution on the 2ist of June, she made the 
ninth State, and the four States that remained, containing 
more than a third of the population of the thirteen, would 
have been able, as Jefferson said, to secure amendments by re 
fusing to ratify the compact without them. Virginia s impor 
tance in the Confederacy we are made to realize by Grigsby s 
statement of statistics : " Her population was over three- 
fourths of all that of New England. It was not far from 
double that of Pennsylvania. It was not far from three times 
that of New York. It was over three-fourths of all the popu 
lation of the Southern States ; . . . and it was more than 
a fifth of the population of the whole Union." Unfortu 
nately the slow methods of transportation at that day did 
not admit of the news of New Hampshire s action reaching 
Richmond before the adjournment of the Convention. The 
intelligence was received in New York on the 24th, and not 
until the last day of June or 1st of July was it known in 
Richmond by an express sent from Hamilton to Madison. 

In the letter of Madison s given above, reference is made 
to an address prepared by Mason and Henry to be distributed 
among the people for their signatures. No trace of such a 
paper is to be found, nor is there any mention elsewhere of 
such a design on the part of the two great leaders of the 
opposition. On the contrary, an anecdote has been pre 
served, which represents Patrick Henry as quelling the mani 
festation of feeling among the Antifederalists which would 
lead them to obstruct the new government : 

1 " History of the Virginia Federal Convention," p. 8. 
vol. ii 1 8 



274 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

" In the evening of the day of the final vote, General Meade 
and Mr. Cabell assembled the discontents in the old Senate Cham 
ber, and after a partial organization of the party, a deputation 
was sent to Patrick Henry inviting him to take the chair. The 
venerable patriot accepted. Understanding that it was their 
purpose to concert a plan of resistance to the operations of the 
Federal government, he addressed the meeting with his accus 
tomed animation upon important occasions ; observing he had 
done his duty strenuously, in opposing the Constitution, in the 
proper place &gt; and with all the powers he possessed. The question 
had been fully discussed and settled, and that as true and faith 
ful republicans, they had all better go home, etc." 

The General Assembly, which met in extra session, called 
together to consider a remonstrance sent them by the Court 
of Appeals, remained in Richmond from the 23d to the 3Oth 
of June. The governor and many delegates were members 
of the Convention. But while the latter was in session 
their attendance, of course, on its important deliberations 
prevented them from taking their seats in the Assembly. 
And in this connection, a treacherous action is charged 
upon Edmund Randolph, which went far to secure the 
federal triumph in the Convention. George Mason, as 
a member of the Assembly, was doubtless present there 
after the 27th, and some resolutions of his, evidently 
written to be laid before the House, are found among his 
papers, though there is no trace of them on the journal of 
the Assembly. They reflect severely on the action of 
Edmund Randolph, the executive, who is accused of sup 
pressing important papers in order to further the cause of 
the Federalists in Virginia. Madison and others had ac 
cused the opposition of artifices to bring about their object, 
though what these were does not clearly appear. The 
counter-charge made by the other party it is difficult to dis 
prove. Randolph, it was said, had delayed his official letter 
to Governor Clinton, of New York, transmitting the pro 
ceedings of the Virginia Assembly concerning the proposed

Convention, from December until the following March. 
And a letter Clinton had written to the Governor of Vir 
ginia in reply, " on the subject of a free and cordial inter 
course and communication of sentiments " between the 
Conventions of the two States, was not only withheld by 
Randolph from the Convention, but was not laid before the 
Assembly until after the Convention Jiad ratified the Consti 
tution. The following is a copy of the resolutions of censure. 
In the original draft there are some erasures and interlinea 
tions not materially affecting the substance of the paper. 

" Resolved, that the official letter from his Excellency, George 
Clinton, Esquire, Governor of the State of New York, dated March 
the T 788, to his Excellency Edmund Randolph, Esquire, 

Governor of this Commonwealth, on the subject of a free and 
cordial intercourse and communication of sentiments between 
the Conventions of the States of New York and Virginia upon the 
new constitution of government recommended by the late Federal 
Convention, which letter was laid before the General Assembly on 
the day of this instant June, ought to have been laid before 

the Convention of this Commonwealth at their first meeting, for 
their consideration. Resolved, that by the said letter s being with 
held from the Convention of this Commonwealth the Convention 
hath been precluded from exercising their judgment upon the ex 
pediency of so important a measure as that mentioned in the said 
letter from his Excellency Governor Clinton. 

" Resolved that a committee of be chosen by ballot, to wait 

on his Excellency Edmund Randolph, Esquire, to know his reasons 
for not laying the said letter before the delegates of the people of 
this Commonwealth in the late Convention, as well as for delaying 
to lay the same before the General Assembly until the day after 
the ratification of the new constitution of government ; and also to 
enquire from what causes the official letter from Governor Ran

276 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



The letter of Governor Randolph dated December 27, 
1787, is preserved among the Clinton papers, and is endorsed 
in George Clinton s handwriting : " Letter from Gov. Ran 
dolph, of the 27th Dec., 1787, with act respecting Conven 
tion. Ansd. 8th May, 1788." There is no statement as to 
when the letter was received. But in a letter from Clinton 
to John Dawson, a member of the opposition, written the 
following December, Governor Clinton, in reference to the 
legislature then in session, says : 

" The letter of the Legislature of Virginia is not yet received and 
I am not without apprehensions that measures may be taken, to 
retard the delivery of it so as to defeat its utility. You will not, I 
am persuaded, ascribe my suspicion on this occasion to an undue 
degree of jealousy when you recollect the circumstance respecting 
my letter which was laid before your Convention." 1 

This letter, as we have seen, was not laid before the 
Convention, but was written for that purpose. And instead 
of being written in March, as George Mason s resolutions 
state, it was written in May, unless, indeed, there was a 
March letter of which there is now no trace. But Clinton s 
endorsement on Randolph s letter would seem to be conclu 
sive, as to the May letter being the one referred to in the 
resolutions, and its context bears out this conclusion. It was 
as follows : 

" NEW YORK, 8th May, 1788. 
" SIR, 

" Your Excellency s letter of the 2yth of December, although it 
appears to have been committed to the post office at Richmond, did 
not come to my hands until the yth of March. The Act enclosed 
was immediately communicated to the legislature, but it was after 
they had passed their resolutions for calling a Convention, and so 
near the close of their sessions, that no order was taken in conse 
quence of it. 

" The system of government proposed by the Federal Convention, 
is an object of such vast importance to the happiness of America

GOVERNOR CLINTON S LETTER. 2JJ 

that it appears to me essential that the people of the different 
States cultivate and cherish the most friendly sentiments towards 
each other, especially during their deliberations on that interesting 
subject. The Convention of this State are to meet at Poughkeepsie 
on the i yth of June, to take the proposed system into considera 
tion, and I am persuaded they will with great cordiality hold a 
communication with any sister State on the important subject, and 
especially with one so respectable in point of importance, ability 
and patriotism as Virginia. I think I may venture to assure your 
Excellency, that the people of this State are disposed to keep up 
that friendly intercourse, and preserve that unanimity respecting 
any great change of government, which appears to be the object of 
the Act of your legislature, and which it is the duty of every good 
man to promote and cherish, and I have no doubt but that our 
Convention will possess the same sentiments. 

"As the session of your Convention will take place before that of 
this State, they will, I presume, commence the measures for hold 
ing such communications as shall be deemed necessary. I cannot 
refrain from expressing regret that a similar conduct has not been 
observed by the States who have already had the proposed system 
under consideration. Friendly communications on the subject, and 
temperate discussions would, it is to be presumed, have had a most 
happy tendency in accommodating it much more to the sentiment 
and wishes of the people of America than is likely to be the case 
in the form it is offered by the General Convention, and acceded 
to by some of the States. Should it be adopted by small majorities 
in the larger States we cannot reasonably hope it will operate so as 
to answer the salutary purposes designed. As I have no direction 
from the legislature on the subject of your communication, your 
Excellency will be pleased to consider this letter as expressive of 
my own sentiments, but I have at the same time a well-founded 
confidence that a majority of the people of the State over which I 
have the honor to preside will concur in them." 

Randolph s letter " appeared to have been committed to the 
post-office at Richmond," but luhen it was put in the post- 
office, or where the detention occurred, must remain a mystery. 
Edmund Randolph wrote to Clinton in August, asking him 

1 " Life of Edmund Randolph," M. D. Conway, p. no. 



2/8 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE AM A SON. 

to look at his letter enclosing the law " concerning our late 
Convention." He speaks of the report in Richmond, that it 
had been withheld " for a considerable time " : " The back 
of my letter," he adds, " will show the day on which it was 
put in the post-office ; and I am desirous of knowing the 
date which is impressed by the postmaster. If your Excel 
lency can inform me of any reasons such as your absence 
from town, etc., which could have prevented the letter from 
reaching your hands, as soon as it ought, I will thank you to 
add them." ! 

This long delay of two months and eleven days prevented 
the message from Virginia reaching New York until after 
the Legislature of that State had concluded their business 
and named a date for the meeting of their Convention. 
The Legislature of Virginia had adjourned also, so that 
Clinton could make no communication to them. There is 
every reason to believe that had this resolution from Virginia 
reached New York in the proper time, the two Conventions 
would have co-operated and the Antifederalists would have 
gained previous amendments in both States. The first reso 
lutions on the subject of the Convention, it will be remem 
bered, passed the House of Delegates on the 25th of 
October. These, Governor Randolph writes Clinton, were 
transmitted to him on the I4th of November ; the second 
resolutions, which Randolph calls the " law," were passed on 
the 3Oth of November and sent on to New York the 2/th of 
December. Here was a delay of twenty-seven days, of 
which there is no explanation, in sending on the Virginia 
resolves to New York. But the Federalists in the Legisla 
ture of Virginia opposed one of these resolutions, the one 
which their opponents deemed of the first importance. This 
was in reference to sending " a deputy or deputies to confer 
with the Convention or Conventions of any other State or 
States in the Union." Richard Henry Lee in a letter to 
General Lamb of June 2/th, replying to one from the latter 
of the i8th of May, " but this day received," laments that it 

1 Ibid,, p. 114. 



SOCIETY OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLICANS, 279 

did not reach him sooner. He thought the plan of cor 
respondence proposed by the society of which Lamb was 
chairman, " would have produced salutary consequences ; as 
it seems to Jiavc been t/ic idea of our Assembly when they sent 
the proposed plan to a Convention." The mails seem to have 
been tampered with in more than one instance, in the inter 
ests of the Federalists. Governor Clinton timed his reply 
to the communication from Virginia so that it should reach 
Governor Randolph before the opening of the Convention. 
A letter dated the 8th of May ought to have been received 
in Richmond about the I5th. It was very natural that 
George Mason should have supposed that it had been re 
ceived at that date. Randolph, in communicating it to the 
Legislature, as he asserts, on the 23d, the day the Assembly 
met, says that " immediately upon receiving " it he laid it 
before the council-board and requested " their opinion 
whether it was of a public or private nature. They conceived 
it to be of the former description, and therefore it is now for 
warded." * The inference is that there had been but a short 
interval between its consideration by the council and its 
transmission to the Assembly. Who was responsible for its 
delay from the I5th of May, when it should have reached 
Richmond, and its reception by the Governor about the 22d 
of June ? Even then there was time, had Randolph desired 
to act an upright part, to have brought it before the Con 
vention, for which it was intended. There was no quorum 
in the House until the 24th, and none in the Senate until 
the following day. The Governor s message and its im 
portant enclosure, the journal says, was only partly read on 
the 24th and laid over till the next day. Good care was 
taken evidently that the character of Clinton s letter should 
not be known until after the Convention had ratified the 
Constitution on the 25th. The Legislature was in sympathy 
with the opposition, and Governor Randolph and his con 
federates feared its influence upon the Convention. Accord-

ing to George Mason, the letter of Clinton was not read in 
the Assembly until the 26th. m Clinton s communication is 
not mentioned in the journal, which states only that a letter 
from the Governor enclosing " sundry letters and papers " 
was laid before the House on the 24th and " partly read " 
that day, and the reading resumed on the 25th. On this 
day a letter from the Governor, stating " several otJier mat 
ters" was received, partly read, and the reading concluded 
on the 26th. 1 

The Society in New York of the Federal Republicans car 
ried on a secret correspondence with the opposition leaders 
in the Virginia Convention, as we have seen. And on the 
2 1st of June, Governor Clinton wrote from the New York 
Convention to General Lamb, telling him that papers and 
letters from Virginia, of which Colonel Oswald had been the 
bearer, had been communicated to the Committee of Oppo 
sition in that body, and he now enclosed to Lamb for him 
to forward, a letter from them " to Colonel Mason, Chairman 
of the Virginia Committee." And he adds: " The letter to 
Colonel Mason, you will observe, is put under cover to Mr. 
George Fleming, merchant of Richmond, as advised in Mr. 
Mason s letter." ! No copy of this letter has been preserved, 
and it is not probable that it reached its destination before 
the Virginia Convention adjourned, if Colonel Mason re 
ceived it at all. So the Virginia Convention was precluded 
from all opportunity of concerting measures with the Con 
vention in New York. And the ratification in Virginia, 
without previous amendments, was followed by the same 
course in New York a month later. North Carolina, all 
honor be given her, refused to ratify the Constitution with 
out amendments, and closed her Convention, August 1st, 
with the passage of resolutions to this effect. Governor 
Clinton had sent a circular letter from the New York Con 
vention to the several States, asking for another General 
Convention, to be procured in the constitutional manner.

COLONEL OSWALD AND LETTERS OF " CENTINEL." 28 1 



In Pennsylvania, the able letters of " Ccntinel," the Junius 
of this contest, were addressed to the country about this time 
through the columns of Colonel Oswald s paper, the Inde 
pendent Gazetteer, in reply to the Federalist, and to James 
Wilson. Of the latter, this clever Antifcderalist writer said, 
he could " bewilder truth in all the mazes of sophistry, and 
render the plainest propositions problematical." The " Cen- 
tinel " letters called attention to the bribery of the post- 
riders in Pennsylvania by the Federalists, who in this way 
held back New York papers of importance which might have 
influenced the Convention in the former State. The short 
hand writer in the Pennsylvania Convention was also bought 
up by the Federalists and only the speeches of Wilson and 
the one other leader of his party in this body were published, 
a flagrant act of political corruption. It has been noticed 
that the ten amendments afterwards added to the Consti 
tution bore a marked resemblance to the fifteen amendments 
offered by the minority in the Pennsylvania Convention. 
And it is suggested "that when Madison, in 1789, drew up 
the amendments for the House of Representatives, he made 
use of those offered by the minority of the Convention of 
Pennsylvania." These were based, however, on the ob 
jections of George Mason as given in the address of the 
Antifederalists in the Pennsylvania Legislature. Massachu 
setts, the first State to propose subsequent amendments 
through her Convention, no doubt took the Pennsylvania 
amendments as a basis for her own, as in Virginia, George 
Mason says the opposition had before them the Massachu 
setts amendments, as doubtless had been the case in Mary 
land and South Carolina. New Hampshire in her twelve 
amendments, acted, apparently, without concert with Vir 
ginia, but the thirty-one amendments of New York and the 
twenty-six of North Carolina were framed with the Virginia 
amendments as a basis, in addition to those that had gone 
before. The Antifederalists were substantially in accord 

1 "Pennsylvania and the Federal Convention, 1787-1788," edited by J. B. 
McMaster and F. IX Stone, p. 19. 



282 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

throughout the country, except in case of the amendment 
desired by the Southern States, requiring a two-thirds vote 
to pass commercial laws. This point might have been 
settled, as George Mason believed, in a second General Con 
vention, had Virginia united with North Carolina in making 
it a condition of ratification. Though it was not one of the 
amendments proposed by South Carolina, as it would have 
unhinged the " bargain " to which she was a party in the 
Federal Convention, it was well known that her people gen 
erally would have welcomed it. 

If it is as a member of the Federal Convention only that 
George Mason excites a national interest, and his autograph 
is sought for by collectors, it is in his twofold character of 
the framer of her first form of government, and the consistent 
advocate of her State sovereignty and reserved rights, that 
he has a claim upon Virginia s regard and gratitude. Not 
Virginia alone, however, but all the States should recognize 
here, in George Mason s States-rights record, his patriotic 
wisdom and foresight. Certainly the South has had cause 
to know him as the advocate of its best interests. Undoubt 
edly had he and his party secured all that they strove for in 
1788, there would have been no war in 1861. 

Judge Chamberlain in a recent paper read before the 
American Historical Association makes the admission that 
the acceptance of the Constitution of 1787 was the " triumph 
of the legitimate successors of the Anti-Revolutionary party 
of 1775," and he adds that " the Revolutionary questions 
from 1789 to 1860 caused dissatisfaction in the States of the 
South as great nearly as that between the colonies and Great 
Britain from 1763 to 1775." He enumerates four points 
which were grievances under the colonial system, and which 
remained under altered conditions, engrafted on the govern 
ment of the American Union. The colonists had complained 
of the King s prerogatives ; under the Federal Constitution 
the Executive was clothed with still greater powers. The 
commercial laws enacted by Parliament had been felt to be 
burdensome and unjust ; yet by the provision of the Con- 



BILL OF RIGHTS AND AMENDMENTS. 283 

stitution relating to navigation laws, Congress was enabled 
to pass in its first session an act " similar in principle and de 
sign to acts of Charles II.," which with some modifications 
is still in force. So with the question of taxation without 
adequate representation, as complained of in some of the 
territories. And lastly, the powers of the judiciary under 
the royal government were not sufficiently controlled by the 
people ; the Constitution increased this grievance " to an 
extent unknown to the colonies." This condition of things 
to which the Federal Convention reduced the States "was 
brought about only with great difficulty," says Judge Cham 
berlain, " for there was a large minority led by such men as 
George Mason, Elbridge Gerry, and Samuel Adams, who 
strenuously contended that in adopting the Constitution of 
1787 the people surrendered everything, except indepen 
dence, for which they had fought seven years." 

George Mason, as chairman of the Committee of Oppo 
sition in the Virginia Convention, left among his papers 
two drafts of amendments and a draft of a bill of rights, 
with several forms of a resolve that was to introduce them. 2 
This declaration of rights, which was based, as were the 
other State bills of rights, on the early paper written by 
George Mason in 1776, is substantially the same as that 
adopted by the Convention, with the exception of one 
important clause in the third section. This was, " that 
whenever any government shall be found inadequate or 
contrary to these purposes, [the benefit, etc., of the people] 
a majority of the community hath an indubitable, unalien- 
able, and indefeasible right to reform, alter, or abolish it, 
and to establish another in such manner as shall be judged 
most conducive to the public weal." The Constitution 
received ten amendments in the two years succeeding its 
adoption. Of these, the first eight correspond to the eighth, 
eleventh, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seven 
teenth, eighteenth, and twentieth sections of the bill of 

1 " Papers of the American Historical Association," vol. iii., No. i. 
a Appendix iv. 3 Ibid. 



284 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

rights recommended by the Virginia Convention. The 
ninth amendment corresponds to some extent with Virginia s 
seventeenth amendment, while the tenth amendment ex 
presses, though not in identical terms, the principle of 
Virginia s first amendment. These two amendments, as has 
been sarcastically observed, " meant something to the mind 
of that generation ; to subsequent generations the meaning 
depended upon degrees of latitude." The first Virginia 
amendment, as it was formulated by George Mason, was 
taken from the Articles of Confederation, and was as follows : 
" That each State in the Union shall retain its sovereignty, 
freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, 
and right \vhich is not by this Constitution expressly dele 
gated to the Congress of the United States." * A few years 
later, though George Mason did not live to see it, his argu 
ments, to some extent, bore fruit in the eleventh amendment, 
which prohibits suits against States in the federal courts. 
The most important of the Antifederalist amendments 
which were not incorporated in the Constitution, related to 
the powers of Congress in regard to taxation, navigation 
laws, treaties, and the regulation of elections ; to the great 
powers given the federal judiciary, and to certain features 
in the composition of the executive office, and its duration. 
The iniquity of a federal election law, to be passed by a 
sectional party, which has recently menaced the Southern 
States, recalls the wise provision of Virginia in her sixteenth 
amendment (taken from the third amendment of the oppo 
sition), in which the true intent of the framers of the Con 
stitution is clearly stated : " That Congress shall not alter, 
modify, or interfere in the times, places, or manner of hold 
ing elections for senators and representatives, or either of 
them, except when the legislature of any State shall neglect, 
refuse, or be disabled by invasion or rebellion to prescribe the 
same." s This was one of the questions argued in The 

1 Magazine of American History, vol. xv., p. 589. " The Virginia Conven 
tion, 1788," A. W. Clason.

JEFFERSON DAVIS ON GEORGE MASON. 285 

Federalist, and explained there in accordance with the Vir 
ginia amendment. The first step in violation of this part of 
the Constitution was taken in 1871, by the act appointing 
federal supervisors of elections through the circuit judges. 

Jefferson Davis, in the Senate of the United States in 
1860, referring to the debates in the Federal Convention, on 
giving power to Congress to coerce the States, pays the 
following tribute to George Mason, as " one whose wisdom, 
as we take a retrospective view, seems to me marvellous." 
Mr. Davis says of him : " Not conspicuous in debate, at least 
not among the names which first occur when we think of that 
bright galaxy of patriots and statesmen, he was the man who, 
above all others, it seems to me, laid his finger upon every 
danger, and indicated the course that danger was to take." 
One of the great dangers which George Mason had foretold 
soon made itself apparent, the beginning of a course of 
sectional legislation inflicting great injury on the South. 
In 1800, Jefferson writes : " While the navigating and pro 
vision States, who are the majority, can keep open all the 
markets, or at least sufficient ones for their objects, the cries 
of the tobacco makers, who are the minority, and not at all 
in favor, will hardly be listened to." And comparing the 
situation to the fable of the monkey using the cat s paws, he 
says: " It shows that G. Mason s proposition in the Conven 
tion was wise, that on laws regulating commerce two-thirds 
of the votes should be requisite to pass them." * Twenty- 
eight years later this was the result, according to Benton : 

" Under federal legislation the exports of the South have been 
the basis of the federal revenue. Virginia, the two Carolinas 
and Georgia defray three-fourths of the annual expense of sup 
porting the federal government ; and of this great sum nothing 
or next to nothing returns to them in shape of government ex 
penditures it flows northward. This is the reason why wealth 
disappears from the South and rises up in the North. Federal 
legislation does all this." 3

286 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

Direct or internal taxation the Antifederalists wished to 
reserve to the State government while giving up external 
or indirect taxation to the federal government. This proved 
to be a mistake, and it was through the tariff that the South 
was impoverished, yet the eighth Virginia amendment would 
have secured her interests, and given her "an absolute gua 
ranty of power." ! 

How much Virginia gave up when she entered into the 
Union of 1787, and how great her prosperity had been 
previously, Grigsby points out in his invaluable history of 
the Convention that sealed her fate : " In the five years of 
peace," after the Revolution, he says, " our tobacco, grain, 
and other productions of the soil and the forest maintained 
the grandest commerce that had ever spread its wings from 
an Anglo-Saxon settlement in the New World towards the 
shores of the Old, and such as was never seen in the colony, 
and such as, with the exception of a short period, has never 
been seen in Virginia since." He calls attention to the 
instructive fact " that the period from the death of Charles 
the First in 1641 to the restoration of Charles the Second 
a period of nineteen years and the period between the 
peace of 1783 and the adoption of the Federal Constitution 
of 1788 a space of five years have been the most pros 
perous in our history ; and that of the two centuries and 
a half of Virginia [this was written in 1858] it was during 
those two periods only she enjoyed the benefits of a trade 
regulated by her own authority, unrestricted and untaxed." 2 
The mistake of the Virginia Federalists was in the false 
estimate they had formed of the general condition and 
commerce of Virginia : 

"It led, in the vain hope of sudden improvement, to the 
hasty adoption of the present Federal Constitution without 
previous amendments, and to the surrender of the right of regu 
lating its commerce by the greatest State of the confederation to 
an authority beyond its control. ... It destroyed our direct

MISTAKE OF THE VIRGINIA FEDERALISTS. 287 

trade with foreign powers. It banished the flag of Virginia from 
the seas. Instead of building and manning the ships which 
carried the product of our labor to foreign ports, and which 
brought back the product of the labor of others to our own ports, 
as some were persuaded to believe would be the result of the 
change, it compelled us thenceforth to commit our produce to 
the ships of other States, and to receive our foreign supplies 
through other ports than our own. It brought about the strange 
result that, instead of a large part of the cost of defraying the 
expenses of the government of Virginia being derived from the 
duties levied upon foreign commerce, these duties, though levied 
upon a scale unknown in that age, will not suffice [in 1858] to 
pay the expenses of collection by other hands than our own." 1 

In the last quarter of a century, or since the war, the 
United States government has grown rich with the high 
tariffs which it has imposed upon the people in violation of 
all sound economic law ; and statesmen and social reformers 
see in a return to the principle of the early Republic, a tariff 
for revenue only, the sole cure for the labor troubles of the 
time. " Our present tariff laws," wrote the Secretary of the 
Treasury during Cleveland s administration, " are a needless 
oppression instead of an easy burden. All our customs 
revenue might be collected by strictly revenue duties upon 
a few score articles, instead of by extravagant or prohibitory 
duties upon more than four thousand articles." 2 In that 
year, 1886, there were a million idle working-men in the 
land, while the treasury was groaning under its huge surplus. 
The political situation since then has grown steadily worse, 
with a faction in power opposed to every measure of reform, 
and seeking to dissipate the surplus in extravagant schemes 
of partisan legislation. During the century that has passed 
since the formation of the Union, it has been seen that the 
powers of Congress under the "necessary and proper" 
clause of the Constitution have been augmented to an 
alarming extent. The Antifederalists in reprobating the

288 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

"sweeping clause," as they termed it, were wise indeed, in 
their generation, and their fears of centralization have been 
amply justified. The Due de Noailles, a French observer 
of American government, points out that the constitutional 
limitations of the legislative power have been almost entirely 
neutralized by this dangerous clause. 1 Our great Southern 
statesman, Jefferson Davis, noting the tendency to central 
ization which is the outcome of the unbridled power of 
Congress, refers to Madison s fear " when the Constitution 
was being formulated, that young men under its provisions 
would not care to enter Congress, preferring the finer field 
opened to them by the legislatures of the sovereign States. 
What would he think now," adds President Davis, " could 
he return to earth and see what centralization has done and 
is doing? What would be his feelings when he saw one 
house of Congress passing the Blair Educational Bill, while 
the other was considering and finally passing a bill in regard 
to bogus butter? " 2 The Senate, it was believed, would by 
its dignity and wisdom balance any extravagant or inex 
pedient legislation in the larger and popular branch of 
Congress. But the degeneracy of the Senate is a theme for 
the diatribes of the American political philosopher. To a 
river and harbor bill the Senate attaches " indefensible 
jobs." Of a canal scheme, which would construct a canal 
entirely within the limits of a single State, " a measure that 
inaugurates a system that would lead to the most prodigal 
extravagance the inauguration of a class of legislation that 
is in the face of the Constitution, if the Constitution means 
anything," 3 the Senate is the patron. And the Senate is 
responsible for beginning the extravagant pension legislation 
which has become one of the crying corruptions of the 
federal government. 

One of George Mason s amendments to the Constitution, 
which was not included among those adopted by the Feder 
alists of the Virginia Convention, is as follows :

3 The Action, July 15, 1886. 



GEORGE MASON S PREVISION. 289 



" That there shall be a constitutional, responsible Council, 
to assist in the administration of government, with the power 
of choosing out of their own body a president, who in case of the 
death, resignation or disability of the President of the United 
States, shall act, pro tempore, as Vice President, instead of a vice 
president elected in the manner prescribed by the Constitution ; 
and that the power of making treaties, appointing ambassadors, 
other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Courts, 
and all other officers of the United States, whose appointments 
are not otherwise provided for by the Constitution, and which 
shall be established by law, be vested in the President of the 
United States with the assistance of the Council so to be ap 
pointed. But all treaties so made or entered into shall be sub 
ject to the revision of the Senate and House of Representatives 
for their ratification." 

The fear expressed by George Mason, that in case no 
council was provided for the President one would grow out 
of the great departments, " the worst and most dangerous of 
all ingredients in a free country," proved to be prophetic, as 
Washington did create such a council, and suffered its mem 
bers to guide his actions. 2 The supervision over treaties 
which the Antifederalists desired for the House of Repre 
sentatives is to-day as much a living issue as it was under the 
first administration. The House asserted its right in the 
case of Jay s treaty, and the decision left the matter an 
open question. It came up again with the Louisiana Pur 
chase treaty; and lastly in 1867, when the purchase of 
Alaska was made, the House reaffirmed its privilege. In 
the bill appropriating the amount to be paid for the new 
territory, the preamble attached to it in the House stated 
that the stipulations of the treaty were such as " by the 
Constitution are submitted to the power of Congress and 
over which Congress has jurisdiction ; and it being for such 
reasons necessary that the consent of Congress should be 
given to said stipulations before the same can have full force 
and effect," etc. The Senate refused to concur in this pre-

amble and substituted another which was violently opposed, 
and only passed at length by a very small majority, many 
members not voting. 

The amendment in regard to the Executive, " That no 
person shall be capable of being President of the United 
States for more than eight years in any term of sixteen 
years," has become, it would seem, an unwritten law, to be 
read between the lines of the constitutional compact. In 
connection with the judiciary system of the United States, 
a direct confirmation of George Mason s foresight may be 
noted in the operation of the federal courts. In his argu 
ment on the subject in the Virginia Convention, he supposes 
a case and says that even if a " poor man should be able to 
obtain judgment in the inferior court, for the greatest injury, 
what justice can he get on appeal ? Can he go four hundred 
or five hundred miles? On this occasion they are to judge 
of fact as well as law. He must bring his witnesses where he 
is not known, where a new evidence may be brought against 
him, of which he never heard before and which he cannot 
contradict." Again in another connection he says : " How 
will a poor man who is injured or dispossessed unjustly, 
get a remedy ? Is he to go to the federal court, seven or 
eight hundred miles ? He might as well give his claim up. 
He may grumble, but finding no relief he will be con 
tented." Owing to the fee system by which the federal 
official is remunerated instead of receiving a salary, the diffi 
culty as suggested by George Mason is made even worse. 
The compensation of the commissioner before whom the 
complaint is sworn depends on the number of warrants 
issued, the number of days over which the hearings extend, 
and the number of witnesses recognized. A recent writer, 
who calls attention to this matter, says : 

" He [the commissioner] and the marshal can readily play into 
each other s hands, the marshal by finding cases and the commis 
sioner by giving the marshal processes to serve. Then usually 
one commissioner does all the criminal business for a district and 
offenders may be taken before this one from the most remote 



CONGRESS AND THE SUPREME COURT. 29 1 

parts of the district, at great expense to the United States and 
hardship to themselves, as they are called on to find bail and 
counsel where they are strangers. The case is prejudged. The 
prisoner must find bail, and if he admits guilt he must stay 
in jail. . . . He may be in jail weeks, waiting bail for an 
offense punishable only by fine or a small term of imprisonment. 
If tried and acquitted, the attorney gets twice as much as if 
he pleads guilty, and if convicted he is entitled to an additional 
fee." 

George Mason in the Virginia Convention expressed his 
belief that the great powers given the federal judiciary 
tended to destroy the State governments. In 1819 we 
find Jefferson writing of the judiciary as " on every occasion 
driving us into consolidation." He described them at one 
time as " the corps of sappers and miners, steadily working 
to undermine the independent rights of the States, and to 
consolidate all power in the hands of that government in 
which they have so important a freehold estate." 2 John 
Randolph of Roanoke, agreed with Jefferson that "the 
judiciary gravitates towards consolidation," and he consid 
ered the District of Columbia " to be the TTOUGTGO and the 
Supreme Court to be the lever of the political Archi 
medes." 3 If the federal judiciary gravitated towards con 
solidation in the first half century of the Union, its course 
since has been fearfully accelerated. The modern Republi 
can in his interpretation of the Constitution takes the place 
of the early Federalist and has developed his theories. The 
" puissant doctrine " of the implied powers, Mr. Woodrow 
Wilson contends, has made Congress omnipotent, and its 
power over the States is to be extended still further ; 
while the privileges of the federal courts permit them to 
"annul State action, but State courts cannot arrest the 
growth of congressional power." Elsewhere, in writing

292 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

of the relations of the federal judiciary to the States of the 
Union he takes occasion to notice the illegality of the three 
last amendments to the Constitution : 

" The integrity of the powers of the States has depended solely 
upon the conservatism, the conservative legal conscience, of the 
federal courts. State functions have certainly not decayed ; 
but the prerogatives of the States have been preserved, not by 
their own forces of self-defense, but by the national government s 
grace of self-restraint." 

It is admitted that this royal grace of self-restraint was 
not always maintained by the federal courts : 

" The actual encroachments which the latter have permitted 
themselves . . . were not needed to prove the potential suprem 
acy of the federal government. They showed how that potential 
supremacy would on occasion become actual supremacy ; but 
they added nothing but illustration to the principle that there is 
no guarantee but that of conscience that justice will be vouch 
safed a suitor when his adversary is both court and opposing 
litigant." 

As an instance of the " strong instinct to keep within the 
sanction of the law," that inspires the federal conscience, 
there is adduced the case of the amendments. When these 
" were being forced upon the Southern States by means 
which were revolutionary, the outward forms of the Consti 
tution were observed. But it was none the less manifest 
with what sovereign impunity the national government 
might act in stripping those forms of their genuineness." 
Another political writer, in discussing the changes in the 
federal government since 1789, finds this alteration most 
marked in the department of the judiciary. He says of the 
courts that they " have increased steadily in power and 
independence, so far as their relations to the two co-ordi 
nate branches of government are concerned. The change, 
silent, steady, has certainly transformed the governments

within themselves, and to the Federal Union it has furnished 
the main bulwark of its power." 

The biographer of John Randolph wrote in 1850, of 
George Mason, calling him " the champion of the States 
and the author of the doctrine of State Rights." " Many 
of the prophecies of this profound statesman," he adds, 
" are recorded in the fulfilments of history many of the 
ill-forebodings of the inspired orator [Patrick Henry] are 
daily shaping themselves into sad realities." : Eleven years 
later and Southern discontent had culminated in the sad 
reality of war. " The predictions of George Mason and 
others," writes Professor Bledsoe, " in which they foretold 
the wrongs and aggressions of the Northern States, if armed 
with the formidable powers of the new government, Mr. 
Madison just set aside as unfounded and uncharitable suspi 
cions. Now in regard to this point we need not ask who 
was the wiser of the two, George Mason or James Madison, 
nor need we try the question by any imperfect notions of 
our own. For time has pronounced its irreversible verdict 
in favor of the wisdom of George Mason." It was per 
ceived very clearly by Madison as well as Mason that the 
Constitution was to be a compact between two sections with 
wholly different interests and different social institutions. 
And it was with the understanding that the Southern States 
were to be secured in all their rights that the Union of 1789 
was formed. How these rights were violated, notably in 
questions affecting the institution of slavery, is matter of 
history. A systematic endeavor to repress the expansion of 
the South into new States was one feature of this injustice. 
And before the generation that formed the new government 
had passed away, the cloud was seen in the horizon, no 
larger than a man s hand, out of which in after years was to 
burst the storm of civil war. There were two Federalists,

2Q4 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

members of the Convention of 1788, who lived to see and 
deplore the tendency of the government which they had 
urged upon Virginia. Madison, in his later public acts, in a 
measure retrieved the errors of his earlier manhood. And 
Francis Corbin acknowledged with grief to John Randolph 
in 1818 his conviction that the " centripetal force of this con 
federacy is greater than the centrifugal." He saw " that 
men of a certain description are resolved at all hazards and 
by all means, to break down the State sovereignties, our only 
barrier against Federal tyranny, and to erect on their ruins a 
uniform system of consolidated despotism." 1 Jefferson 
wrote in 1820: "The coincidence of a marked principle, 
moral and political, with a geographical line, once con 
ceived, would never be obliterated from the mind ; that 
it would be recurring on every occasion and renewing irrita 
tions, until it would kindle such mutual and mortal hatred, 
as to render separation preferable to eternal discord." * 
Again he says of the policy of the Abolitionists : " All 
know that permitting the slaves of the South to spread 
into the West will not add one being to that unfortunate 
condition, that it will increase the happiness of those exist 
ing, and by spreading them over a larger surface, will dilute 
the evil everywhere, and facilitate the means of getting rid 
of it." : There is something most pathetic in the words of 
this patriot of 76, as with mournful prevision he looks for 
ward to the inevitable issue : 

" What does the Holy Alliance in and out of Congress mean 
to do with us on the Missouri question ? . . . Are we then to 
see again Athenian and Lacedemonian Confederacies ? to urge 
another Peloponnesian war to settle the ascendancy between 
them ? Or is this the tocsin of merely a servile war ? That 
remains to be seen ; but not I hope by you or me. Surely they 
will parley awhile and give us time to get out of the way."

STATE SOVEREIGNTY AND SECESSION. 295 

On the question of the ultimate course to be pursued, Jeffer 
son s voice gives no uncertain sound. And we cannot doubt 
that George Mason would have been equally explicit. After 
anticipating the " longer and greater sufferings " which 
would justify secession, he adds : " We must have patience 
. . . and separate from our companions only when the sole 
alternatives left are the dissolution of our union with them, 
or submission to a government without limitation of powers. 
Between these two evils, when we must make a choice, there 
can be no hesitation." So John Randolph in 1814, when 
New England had serious thoughts of putting in practice 
the principle of secession, wrote of the possible " Southern 
Confederacy " that would remain, and while deprecating such 
an issue in his letter to the inhabitants of the Eastern States, 
he maintained that if there was hostility between the States 
of the Union they should separate : " For with every other 
man of common sense," he adds, " I have always regarded 
union as the means of liberty and safety ; in other words, of 
happiness, and not an end to which these are to be sacri 
ficed." 2 In this connection, the words of Hamilton in The 
Federalist may be noted. Replying to the supposed case of 
a combination of States refusing to appoint Senators, he 
says, " it is not from a general and permanent combination 
of the States that we can have anything to fear." But 
granting the existence of such a combination of States, it 
" would suppose a fixed and rooted disaffection in the great 
body of the people, which will either never exist at all, or 
will in all probability proceed from an inaptitude of the 
general government to the advancement of their happiness, 
in which event no good citizen could desire its continuance." 3 
The principle of community independence and sovereignty, 
proclaimed first by George Mason in the Virginia Bill of 
Rights, reiterated by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of 
Independence, asserted in the Articles of Confederation, and

296 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

acknowledged by Great Britain in the treaty of peace, it 
remains for the modern exponents of the American political 
system to disavow. One of them gravely writes : 

" There is no power granted or * reserved to the local States 
or its people which may not be taken away without their consent. 
They possess no power which is not held at the will of a power 
higher and outside of themselves. This view may not conform 
to the intent of the framers of the Constitution or to later opin 
ion as to the effect of their work, but what is of more importance, 
it conforms to actual facts as they exist. We have now reached 
a point where we can afford to see these facts as they are, and we 
shall escape much confusion of thought if we cease to talk of 
Sovereign States and a divided sovereignty." 

If this be so, then have we realized the worst fears of the 
Antifederalists. But if such was not " the intent of the framers 
of the Constitution," it is expedient that the people who pro 
fess to live still under the institutions of 1787-89, should see 
that the " actual facts " conform to the theory of the fathers. 
A Democratic Executive has sought in the exercise of the veto 
power to restrain the centralizing legislation of Congress ; 
and recent decisions of a Republican Supreme Court tend in 
the same conservative direction, declaring against the dan 
gerous principle that the Federal Legislature can supersede 
that of the States. 2 The doctrine of State sovereignty is 
indeed the anchor to which we should cling as the only hope 
of political liberty. To quote again from that wise Southern 
statesman who has just gone from us, the President of the 
Confederate States : 

" By all that is revered in the memory of our Revolutionary 
sires, and sacred in the principles they established, let not the 
children of the United States be taught that our Federal Govern 
ment is sovereign ; that our sires, after having by a long and 
bloody war won community independence, used the power, not

for the end sought, but to transfer their allegiance, and by oath 
or otherwise bind their posterity to be the subjects of another 
Government, from which they could only free themselves by 
force of arms." 

The early Federalists loved to compare the Union to a 
house with its thirteen compartments and its one roof shel 
tering all. The Antifederalists might have suggested that a 
fit motto over the door of this house would be the words 
which Dante saw inscribed over the entrance to the Inferno :

CHAPTER IX. 

THE PHILOSOPHER AND SEER. 
1788-1790. 

Upon the adjournment of the Convention George Mason 
returned to " Gunston Hall," and the following letters to his 
son in France, written at this time, contain characteristic 
allusions to public events : 

VIRGINIA, FAIRFAX COUNTY, 
GUNSTON HALL, July 21, 1788. 
DEAR JOHN : 

I have been so ill for these two days past that I have been 
unable to sit up, and now write in great pain. You must there 
fore excuse the shortness of this letter. 

I enclose you the two or three last days proceedings of the 
Virginia Convention, by which you will see the small majority 
which has ratified the new project. The minority are as respecta 
ble for their weight and influence as their number, and it will 
require their most prudent exertion to keep the people quiet in 
some parts of the country. . . . The debates are not yet 
published, nor is there any cause to expect that they will be 
authentic. The short-hand man who took them down being a 
Federal partizan, they will probably be garbled in some such 
partial manner as the debates in the Pennsylvania Convention 
have been by Lloyd. 

I have desired Captain Fenwick to send you some patterns of 
sundry coarse articles which being in great annual demand in all 
the States that have many slaves, if they could be made in France 
and furnished upon equal or better terms than in Great Britain, 
it would contribute greatly to increase the commercial intercourse 

298 



LETTERS TO JOHN MASON IN FRANCE. 299 

between the two countries ; and would be an inducement to the 
country gentlemen as well as merchants here to ship tobacco to 
France. I enclose you a letter to Mr. Jefferson upon the sub 
ject, left open for your perusal, which you will please to seal and 
forward. You will perceive by it, that I have some expectation 
the French ministry will patronize the manufacturers in imitating 
these articles for the American trade. If they do, and the hint 
originates from your house, it may prove very advantageous to 
its credit, especially if the attempt succeeds. You will there 
fore, if you find occasion, confer with Mr. Jefferson upon the 
subject. I have desired Capt. Fenwick to send with the patterns, 
the British sterling first cost of each article. You can easily 
compute and accommodate the difference between the English 
and French measure &c. The fault of all the coarse French 
woolens I have seen is their being stiffened and battered up with 
paste or glue. The nearer the coarse woolens which our negroes 
have been accustomed to are imitated the better ; and particular 
attention should be paid to the width, which should be full three 
fourths of an English yard. 

The hoes and irons should be made of good iron, the blades 
of the hoes hardened, and the axes well steeled and tempered. 
The workmen should be informed that tar is not put over the 
hoes and axes to conceal cracks or flaws, but to preserve them 
from rusting. I am not able to sit up longer at present, than to 
wish you health, and success in your business, and to desire you 
will let me hear from you, as often, and as particularly as you can. 
I am, dear John, 

Your affectionate father, 

G. MASON. 



VIRGINIA, GUNSTON HALL, 

September 2, 1788. 
DEAR JOHN : 

This will be delivered you by Capt. Gregory, commander and 
owner of the ship Commerce, who brings a load of tobacco for the 
Farmers General to Bordeaux ; and was so obliging to call 
upon me, a day or two ago, to know if I had any commands to 
the port to which he was going, and to assure me they should be 
delivered with his own hands. 



3OO LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MA SOX. 

Notwithstanding Col. Fitzgerald s brig was delayed so long, by 
his negligence, I was prevented writing by her, when she sailed, 
by her going down the river, without my knowing it. I had 
wrote you by her, about a month before, at the time she was 
expected to have sailed, which letter, I hope has come safe to 
hand, but am afraid the bag of hominy I sent you by her had 
been so long on board, that it will be moulded or damaged. At 
the time I wrote you by the said brig I was extremely ill with the 
convulsive cholic complicated, I believe, with the gout in my 
stomach ; which continued with little or no intermission three 
days and nights, and left me in so debilitated a state, that I was 
not able to go out of the house for four or five weeks ; and it is 
not until within these few days that I have begun to recruit. 

I enclose you a letter for Mr. Jefferson, respecting the French 
endeavoring to supply us (from patterns sent) with some 
particular articles of coarse manufacture, which hitherto have 
been imported only from Great Britain. It is a subject of much 
greater importance than you may at first conceive, and I think I 
should not exaggerate, in saying that the annual demand for them 
in the five Southern States, is not less than 10,000,000 of Livres. 
Judge then what effect the French being able to supply us with 
these articles upon equal or better terms than Great Britain, 
would have upon the commercial intercourse between the two 
countries, and the shipment of American produce to France. I 
desired Capt. Fenwick to send you the patterns by the brig, but 
forgot to ask him about them when he was here last. He is now 
down the country, endeavoring to collect tobacco for a small brig 
of Messrs. Forrest and Stoddert, which he has chartered, and is 
now loading at Georgetown, so that he will not probably have an 
opportunity of writing by Capt. Gregory. 

A violent storm of wind and rain, which we had about the 2oth 
of August, with the almost continual rains for many days after 
wards, has done great damage to the tobacco, and I think will 
shorten the crops much, as well as injure the quality of the whole, 
which I believe will in general be unusually bad this year. I 
think your brothers and myself have lost between thirty and forty 
hogsheads of tobacco in our own crops ; our wheat has also suf 
fered some damage, and our hay a great deal. The Indian corn 
appeared at first to be greatly injured, but has recovered more 



AMERICA N- PROD UCE A ND FRENCH MANU.FA CTURES, 30 1 

than could have been expected, so that the crops of corn will be 
pretty good. The shortness of the crop of tobacco will con 
siderably affect the interest of your house ; if the crop of tobacco 
had been as good as it promised about the first of August, your 
consignments next summer would have been very considerable. 
I have written to my friends in the Eastern and Southern States 
in favor of your house, which I hope will have a good effect. 

I did not apply (as you desired) to Mr. Alexander; my 
acquaintance with him was hardly sufficient to warrant such a 
request ; and his character in France (as I have heard) being 
doubtful, I did not think letters from him would operate to your 
advantage. My late illness has hitherto prevented my writing to 
Doctor Franklin ; but I will do it soon, though I doubt whether 
letters from him will be of much service to your house, as his in 
timacies were more among the literati than the mercantile part of 
the nation. I sent you in my last letter lists of the firms of most 
of the mercantile houses in the lower parts of Virginia. I would 
recommend it to you, to endeavor to cultivate a correspondence 
with the American minister, Mr. Jefferson, which I think will be 
serviceable to you, and give credit to the house. I hope you de 
termine to persevere in the line you set out, of giving no credits 
whatever in America ; and I wish you to be very careful and par 
ticular in purchasing the goods you send to your correspondents 
upon the best terms, it being a matter upon which your consign 
ments will in great measure depend. 

Pray write to me often, and particularly, respecting your situa 
tion, your success and prospects in business ; what health you 
enjoy, how you like the country you are in and what progress 
you make in the language, or anything else interesting to you, 
and consequently to me. 

I send you by the Brig the proceedings of the Virginia Conven 
tion. I have not yet seen a publication of the debates. Notwith 
standing there was in the New York Convention a majority of two to 
one against the new Constitution without previous amendments, yet 
after the adoption by Virginia they thought themselves under the 
necessity of adopting also, for fear of being left out of the Union, 
and of civil commotions. They have drawn up amendments 
nearly similar to those of Virginia and recommended them unani- 



302 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



mously in the strongest manner, and they have written a circular 
to all the other States soliciting their cooperation in obtaining 
the amendments by application to the new Congress at their first 
meeting which it is expected will be in March in New York, so 
there is still hope of safe and proper amendments. The North 
Carolina Convention has rejected the new Constitution unless 
previous amendments are made, by a great majority. I have not 
yet seen their amendments but am informed they are much the 
same as those recommended by Virginia. Your brothers have 
sent you a number of late newspapers, which will give you pretty 
full information of the present state of American politics. 

All your brothers and sisters who are at home, have written to 
you by this opportunity. The family are all well, and desire to 
be kindly remembered to you. I am extremely anxious to hear 
of your safe arrival and am, dear John, 

Your most affectionate father, 

G. MASON. 

P. S. Your friend Mr. Anthony called to see me, and spent 
an evening with me last week on his return from North Carolina ; 
where he tells me he has been near three months, and is to return 
thither again in October. If I am not mistaken he is about com 
mitting matrimony with a Miss Hill, daughter of Mr. Whitmel 
Hill, the most wealthy man in the State of North Carolina. 

VIRGINIA, GUNSTON HALL, 

December 18, 1788. 
DEAR JOHN : 

Capt. Fenwick s letter from George Town last week, per the 
post, having miscarried (as most of my letters via Alexandria do), 
I knew nothing of the ship Washington being so near sailing, 
until I was informed, this evening by express from Capt. F. that 
the ship would be down to-night, or early to-morrow morning, so 
that I have very little time left to write to you by her. I have 
not received any letter from you since your arrival at Bordeaux, 
but one of the fifteenth of August per the Coulteana, Capt. Lime- 
bourg, via Norfolk ; and that so soon after your arrival that you 
were then able to give me little account of your affairs or situa 
tion, or how you liked the place. I hope to be particularly in 
formed in your next letters. 



POLITICAL DETAILS. 303 



I wrote you by Fitzgerald s brig, and also by Capt. Gregory 
who was so obliging as to call on me on purpose, and promised 
to deliver the packet with his own hand. By one of these oppor 
tunities (I now forget which), I sent you the proceedings of the 
Virginia Convention, and informed you of the then state of 
American politics. North Carolina has rejected the new govern 
ment unless previous amendments, almost the same with the sub 
sequent amendments proposed by Virginia, can be obtained. 
Rhode Island has yet done nothing decisive on the subject. New 
York discouraged by the adoption in Virginia, with a majority in 
their Convention of two to one against the new form of govern 
ment, received it upon the minority s agreeing to recommend 
unanimously amendments similar to those in Virginia, and voting 
a circular letter from their president Governor Clinton to invite 
the concurrence of the other States in an immediate application 
to the new Congress for calling another Federal Convention to 
consider them. The other States have all adopted ; Connecticut, 
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland without recom 
mending any amendments ; New Hampshire, Massachusetts, 
South Carolina and I think Georgia, with recommendation of 
amendments. The Virginia Legislature now sitting have taken 
up the subject upon the ground of the New York circular letter 
and by a large majority have voted an application to Congress 
for immediately calling a Federal Convention to consider the 
amendments proposed by this and other States. Their address 
to Congress for this purpose is a very firm, and in my opinion, 
proper one. They have also wrote a circular to the other States 
desiring their concurrence. . . . Colonel R. H. Lee and 
Colonel Grayson are appointed members of the Senate for this 
State. Virginia is divided into ten districts as nearly equal as 
circumstances will permit, the rule of computation being the 
number of militia in each county, each district to choose one 
representative [who has been a resident of the district for twelve 
months last past] to the new government, and it is thought the 
elections will go very generally in favor of men who are for call 
ing a Federal Convention to make amendments. Our district 
consists of the counties of London, Fairfax, Prince William, 
Fauquier, Stafford, and King George. Several candidates are 
talked of by the other party, to wit Ludwell Lee, Dr. Stuart, Mr. 



304 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

Fitzhugh of " Chatham," Leven Powell and Martin Pickett ; but 
they will hardly, I suppose, be foolish enough to start more than 
one. The gentlemen for the amendments have not yet fixed 
upon a candidate and I doubt we shall be at a loss for one, 
several who have been applied to having refused. If we can pre 
vail upon a proper person to offer I think there will be little 
doubt of his succeeding. Mr. James Monroe of Fredericksburg 
(late member of Congress) opposes Mr. Madison in the Spottsyl- 
vania and Orange district and it is thought will carry his election. 
Beverley Randolph is chosen Governor of Virginia in the room 
of young A Id. 

Several of our late Convention acquaintance are appointed 
members of the Federal Senate ; John Langdon, Esq : from New 
Hampshire, Caleb Strong, Esq: from Massachusetts, Dr. Johnson 
and Oliver Ellsworth, Esq: from Connecticut, Mr. Paterson from 
Jersey, Robert Morris from Pennsylvania, George Read and 
Richard Bassett, Esqurs: from Delaware. So much for politics. 
For domestic occurrences I refer you to your sisters, who I make 
no doubt will give you a satisfactory detail. 

Your partner Mr. Joseph Fenwick has written to me to desire 
my interest in getting him the appointment of Consul in Bor 
deaux. Upon talking with your brother George upon the sub 
ject, I find he had recommended the same thing to you, before 
you left Virginia, a circumstance I was not before apprised of. 
But as Mr. Fenwick has written to me to recommend him, before 
he knew of your previous intention (indeed before your arrival 
in Bordeaux) your brother George and I are both of opinion that 
it will be proper to make the application for him, in preference to 
you, for several reasons ; first because he is an older man, and 
consequently has more experience ; secondly because he will 
probably remain longer in France ; and above all, because we 
would avoid giving the smallest cause for any jealousy or mis 
understanding between you. You may therefore assure Mr. 
Fenwick that what interest I may have, with our new rulers, shall 
be most cordially exerted in his favor, as soon as the new Con 
gress meets ; though I have no reason to expect my interest will 
have much weight in the new government, having, as you know, 
warmly opposed it, in its present shape, both in the Federal Con 
vention and our own. In my opinion a letter of recommendation

from our Minister, Mr. Jefferson, would have a good effect. Pray 
excuse me particularly to Mr. Fenwick, for not writing to him by 
this opportunity. The ship s sailing so suddenly and unex 
pectedly has not left me time ; and I could have said little to 
him but a repetition of what I have said, and shall say, to you. 

The debates in the Virginia Convention are published, at least 
one volume of them. As soon as I can get them I will send them 
to you, though I believe they will be hardly worth your attention, 
being, I am told, very partially garbled by the short-hand writer 
who took them down and published them. This I always ex 
pected, as I understood the man was a federal partizan and they, 
you know as well as I do, stick at nothing. He had the audacity 
to desire the sanction of Convention authority for his work, even 
before he began it, and got a member to make a motion for that 
purpose on the first day of the Convention, but upon the im 
propriety and absurdity of it being properly exposed by Mr. 
Henry and myself, the member who made the motion (George 
Nicholas) was ashamed of it and withdrew it. So that they come 
out with no other sanction than the credit of the publishers. 
Some of the Federalists (as they call themselves) revised and 
corrected their speeches. I know that some of the principal 
gentlemen on the other side were privately applied to by the 
short-hand writer to do the same, but treated the proposal with 
contempt. 

One thing with respect to the appointment Mr. Fenwick de 
sires, I had almost forgot to mention ; I fear some difficulties 
may arise from it, and being of opinion with Mr. Fenwick, that such 
an appointment would be advantageous to the house, I wish to 
have it in my power, by proper information on the subject to ob 
viate them. Hitherto, I believe, there has been only one Ameri 
can consul-general in France ; unless the arrangement is altered, 
it is probable Mr. Barclay will be continued ; it may be necessary 
therefore to show, that a particular consul will be requisite at 
Bordeaux or in its neighborhood, for that part of the kingdom. 

I am told there are a great many young Irishmen in Bordeaux ; 
if we may judge of them by the samples we have here, they are 
neither safe nor respectable companions. I trust I am as free as 
most men, from illiberal national prejudices ; but yet I wish you 
to converse with them with caution, and to avoid as far as good 



VOL. II. 20 



306 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

manners will permit, all intimacy with them. Your not being able 
to speak French will naturally lead you into company, and intima 
cies with those whom you can converse with easily ; this you must 
guard against, and submit to a little inconvenience to avoid greater 
evils ; and I hope you will soon acquire the French language. 

In a letter Capt. Fenwick showed me from his brother, I ob 
serve Mr. Whitesides of London makes you an offer of a credit 
of ;iooo sterling upon his house, &c. You are obliged to Mr. 
Whitesides for his friendship and ought to return him thanks for 
the offer, but I would, by no means, advise you to accept it ; the 
custom of drawing and re-drawing being the most dangerous, in 
my opinion, of all mercantile expedients. Put yourselves in no 
man s power ; an accident, or a sudden, unexpected call for 
money, you could not pay, might ruin you in a moment ; a suffi 
cient reason surely for avoiding accepting credits, further than 
you can clearly and safely see your way through, if you take them 
at all. And if the business of your house becomes considerable 
(as I think it will) your neighboring merchants and secret rivals 
will look upon you with a jealous eye, and seize any opportunity 
of destroying you. The older I grow, the more experience has 
convinced me, that there are few men to be safely confided in 
ran nantes in gurgite vasto. 

Stick to your first principles oi giving no credits yourselves ; 
especially in America where large credits must infallibly ruin 
you, and small ones are not worth the charge of collecting. By 
giving extensive credits you may, indeed, acquire a large fortune 
upon paper ; but you will never have any anywhere else. Dili 
gence, frugality and integrity will infallibly increase your busi 
ness and your fortunes, if you can content yourselves with 
moderate things at first. You will rise, perhaps, by slow degrees, 
but upon a solid and safe foundation. It is a terrible thing for a 
man to spend the prime of his life in business, to no other pur 
pose than to ruin himself, and others ; and yet this is the case 
with the greater part of those who are called men of great enter- 
prize men of deep speculation, &c. Your business (after the 
house comes to be generally known) will depend entirely upon 
the prices you can render for the commodities consigned you, 
and the prices of the articles you send in return no man will 
long continue any business, unless he finds gain in it. 



ADVICE. 307 



I have written to most of my friends in the different States, in 
forming them of your plan, and recommending the house. From 
the answers I have received, I have reason to think you will meet 
with encouragement, both from the eastward and southward ; 
I think it would be proper for you to write to the gentlemen of 
your acquaintance in the late Federal Convention, and in Boston. 
I have spoken also to a great many of my friends in Virginia ; 
most of them express a desire of giving your house a preference ; 
but vague promises of that sort are little to be relied on. I en 
close you a list of some of those I would advise you to write to. 

The crop of tobacco this year in Virginia is a common one, as 
to quantity, neither very great nor small the quality bad, and I 
think the price in the country will be rather low, not more than 
iS/ to 2o/ Virginia currency per hundred upon Potomac and 
Rappahannock. I applied to some of my Assembly friends 
lately recommending the shipping to your house a quantity of the 
public tobacco received for taxes ; I don t yet know the result ; 
I am sure it would be to the advantage of the public, but I fear 
our finances are too low, and the public too needy, to adopt such 
a plan. 

When I saw Capt. Fenwick about a month ago, I was speaking 
to him, about chartering a small ship, to load with wheat, upon 
consignment. I think one might be speedily filled up, and could 
put a considerable quantity on board her myself ; but I have not 
heard whether he has determined on doing it or not. I have not 
yet received any rents, or got any of my own crops prized, and 
therefore am unable to send you any tobacco by the Washington, 
but shall send some by the first ship which loads here for your 
house in the spring. 

Pray let me hear from you often, and particularly, and believe 
me, dear John, 

Your most affectionate father, 

G. MASON,

308 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OP GEORGE MASON. 



With excellent advice to his son on the conduct of his 
business, and wise warnings against unseemly companions, 
Colonel Mason mingles in these letters shrewd suggestions 
of a public nature. He wished to see France, the recent 
ally of the Americans in the Revolution, taking the place of 
England in supplying the States of the South with the 
coarse woollen fabrics used for their negroes. And he has 
a proposal for the Assembly, that they should ship some of 
the tobacco received for taxes to Bordeaux, consigned to 
the house of Mason & Fenwick, a measure which would 
be advantageous for Virginia, as well as profitable to the 
firm. The political excitement of the Convention struggle 
had subsided ; its unsettled questions lying over for adjust 
ment, it was hoped, by the new Congress. We get echoes, 
however, from the late field of action ; an account of the 
federal partisan," the unappreciated Robertson, and his 
efforts to secure corrected copies of the speeches in the Con 
vention. It is to be regretted that there was not an Anti- 
federalist reporter there also, to whom Mason and Henry 
could have given their confidence. As it is, posterity is 
under obligations to the Federalist. George Mason s allu 
sion to the late governor young A Id " -compressed in 
two words all the scorn felt by his true and vehement nature 
for the man who, as Mason believed, had betrayed his 
country, Virginia, and thrown away the opportunity of 
securing her dearest interests. 

The Virginia Assembly in the fall of this year, under the 
leadership of Patrick Henry, passed the resolutions, com 
mended by Colonel Mason, for calling a second Federal 
Convention. This was urged upon Congress and upon the 
several States. And Richard Henry Lee and William 
Grayson, two of the most able and determined advocates of 
amendments, were elected to the Senate, and were pledged 
to bring forward the subject on the meeting of Congress. 
Madison, defeated for the Senate, was elected by the Feder 
alists to a seat in the House of Representatives. The 
division of Virginia into Congressional districts at this 



THE FAIRFAX COUNTY COUA T. 309 



session, of which George Mason speaks, has been instanced 
by a recent writer, upon very insufficient grounds, as the 
earliest example of gerrymandering. The charge is made 
that the districts were so carved out as to promote the elec 
tion of the Antifederalists. 1 Just the opposite accusation 
was made at the time by the Antifederalists, it seems. 
Theodoric Bland, who calls the Federalists the " Non- 
Emendo-Tories," in a letter to Richard Henry Lee, tells of 
" their manoeuvres " to prevent the latter s appointment to 
the Senate. " Much pains," he adds, " is taken to lay off 
the districts so as to include the most consequent Non- 
Emcndo-Torics, but I expect this bill, which is almost 
entirely of their carving, will be hushed up and served out 
to the public in a more delicate form than it at present 
appears in." : As it finally passed, George Mason thought 
it a proper one, and he opposed, on constitutional grounds, 
as will be seen later, a projected alteration in the formation 
of his own district. The Virginia Legislature, in the fall of 
1788, showed their appreciation of Colonel Mason s services 
to the Commonwealth by naming a county after him. An 
act passed for dividing the county of Bourbon in the district 
of Kentucky, and the new county thus formed was called 
Mason. 

At the January court of Fairfax County in this winter of 
17881789, George Mason, as the presiding justice, used his 
influence in upholding one of the great principles of free 
government. As the record of the court states : 

" On a motion for levying tobacco for the purpose of defraying 
the expences of building a new court-house or repairing of the 
present one, it was objected that the court had no legal authority 
to levy any money or tobacco on the inhabitants of the county 
for any purpose whatever, and the question being put whether 
they were vested with that power or not George Mason, Charles 
Broadwater, Martin Cockburn, Richard Chichester [and eight 
others whose names are given] were of opinion that the power of 

1 Tyler s " Life of Henry," p. 313, American Statesmen Series. 

2 Lee 1 apers, Southern Literary Messenger, Jamiarv, 




$10 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



levying taxes by the courts was destroyed by an express article 
in the bill of rights of this commonwealth." 

But ten of the justices, including Dr. David Stuart, were 
of the contrary opinion. And with this order is found a 
request of the public officers of Fairfax County asking the 
advice of the council and the opinion of the attorney-general 
concerning the power of the county courts in levying taxes. 
A gentleman who was living in Baltimore in 1827, wrote an 
account of a meeting in Alexandria, at which he had been 
present as a youth, when this subject was discussed. He 
recalled the fact of there being a score or more justices on 
the ground and a large crowd of gentlemen, most of them 
eager for the proposed measure. Just before the meeting 
opened it was announced that Colonel Mason was coming to 
oppose the project. But as public opinion was so strongly 
in its favor, and there were known to be so many good 
speakers who would advocate it, an easy triumph was antici 
pated. George Mason arrived, and when the question had 
been argued at length by its friends, he rose and delivered 
such a powerful and convincing argument as to its illegality, 
maintaining that only the representatives of the people could 
properly levy taxes, and the justices present were not such 
representatives, that in all that hitherto confident assembly 
there was not one dissenting voice, and the point was won. 
These reminiscences, though they may possibly exaggerate 
the triumph of Colonel Mason, prove at least that it was owing 
to him that the court decided adversely to the motion, and 
the impression of his eloquence must have been very vivid 
and enduring upon his youthful hearer, since he attributed 
to it such signal results. It may be presumed that the 
council and the attorney-general supported Colonel Mason s 
interpretation of the law. And an act of the Assembly 
passed the 4th of December of this year, which empowered 
the justices of Fairfax County to levy a sum on the tith- 
able persons within the county sufficient for the new court-

house buildings and the two acres of ground on which to 
place them. 1 

The following letters to Capt. James Fenwick, brother of 
John Mason s partner, exhibit Colonel Mason in his character 
of a busy and careful planter and farmer, shipping his tobacco 
and wheat to merchants in Georgetown, to go from there to 
France. 

GUNSTON HALL, March 8th, 1789. 
DEAR SIR : 

1 am sorry I am disappointed in shipping all our wheat by the 
ship Maryland ; but it was impossible to help it. The bad weather 
which delayed Mr. McCarty s boat so long, also prevented Mr. 
Linton s vessel from getting out of Quantico Creek, until it was too 
late to send up any more wheat for this ship ; but I shall depend 
upon getting room for wheat we have left, in the Becky, and as I 
expect she will be quickly despatched it may probably make no 
great difference to me, and I beg you will get the matter so fixed, 
that I may not be again disappointed. The bearer, Mr. McCarty s 
shipper, brings up eight or nine hogsheads of tobacco for my son 
George. You will be pleased to let me know by a line, when he 
returns, at what time the ship Becky will certainly be ready to take 
in wheat, and I will begin to send ours up immediately, and if this 
cannot be yet known, as soon as it can you will be good [enough] 
to inform me by a letter per post, directed to be left at the post- 
office in Colchester, as I shall be anxious to get our wheat up in 
due time. My people went down again, as soon as the river 
opened, to Chickamuxon, to inspect my tobacco and despatch 
Messrs. F[orest] and S[toddert] s craft, but have not yet re 
turned. I imagine the hard frost last Wednesday night stopped 
up the mouth of Chickamuxon Creek, or perhaps the low tides 
have kept the craft aground. She will surely be up the first 
good day, and I hope will bring up my tobacco in time for the 
ship Maryland. 

I am, dear Sir, your most obedient servant, 

G. MASON. 

Capt. James Fenwick, 
George Town.

312 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

GUNSTON HALL, March 27, 1789. 
DEAR SIR : 

The bearer, John Hill, brings up 550 bushels of wheat by our 
measure which is all we have now ready ; this will fall short of the 
quantity I owe Messrs. Forrest and Stoddert, in return for wheat 
they were so kind [as] to put into the ship Becky upon my account. 
But so soon as I know the loss in this last load, by the measure 
ment at George Town, I will desire Messrs. Fenwick, Mason, and 
Company to place to the credit of Messrs. F. and S. the nett pro 
ceeds of as much of my wheat in the Becky as I am deficient in 
repaying them, \vhich I presume will be the most agreeable method 
to those gentlemen of settling it, as it will amount to the same 
thing, as repaying the whole now at Georgetown. 

I will thank you to transmit me by John Hill, when he returns, 
a statement of all our wheat in both ships, according to their 
respective manifests, that I may see whether it corresponds with 
the statement I have given in my letters to F., M., & Co. Upon 
having the account of our wheat in both ships, with the measure 
ment at George Town of the load John Hill now brings, my son 
William and I can easily adjust our respective quantities. 
I am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, 

G. MASON. 

In case of Capt. Fenwick s absence, Major Stoddert will be 
pleased to open this. 1 

Colonel Mason wrote to his son in this same month, on 
the subject of the consulship which he hoped to obtain for 
Mr. Joseph Fenwick. This letter is of special interest, in its 
reference to Washington, as it bears testimony to the early 
and intimate character of the friendship which had subsisted 
between George Mason and George Washington a friend 
ship which the former feared was likely to be interrupted by 
political differences. Colonel Mason s visits to " Mount 
Vernon," however, had not ceased in 1788. On the 2d of 
November of that year, which fell on Sunday, he dined and 
spent the day with Washington. 2 But in the struggle over

MASON S FRIENDSHIP FOR WASHINGTON. 313 

the new Constitution, the old friends had no doubt drifted 
apart. George Mason, the Revolution over in which he 
and Washington had been wholly of one mind, saw now in 
the untried future new dangers springing up to which Wash 
ington was blind. Virginia and the South generally had 
cause later to know him for the wiser man of the two. But 
at this time he was in the party of the minority. And he 
seems to have felt that he must justify himself in his position 
of withstanding the current of public opinion. His con 
science could bear witness, as he says, to the purity of his 
motives. A civil war bears witness now to the sound 
" judgment " which guided his conscience. 

" GUNSTON HALL, March 13, 1789. 
" DEAR JOHN : 

"... I have not yet made an application on behalf of 
Mr. Fenwick for the appointment of consul, as the President of 
the United States has the nomination to offices. I thought there 
was some impropriety and indelicacy in making application 
before General Washington has accepted the office of President, 
to which he has been elected by the unanimous suffrage of the 
electors in all the ratifying States. You may assure Mr. Fenwick 
that as soon as this ceremonial is adjusted I shall not fail to 
exert whatever interest I have in his favor. You know the 
friendship which has long existed (indeed from our early youth) 
between General Washington and myself. I believe there are 
few men in whom he placed greater confidence ; but it is possi 
ble my opposition to the new government, both as a member of 
the national and of the Virginia Convention, may have altered 
the case. In this important trust, I am truly conscious of having 
acted from the purest motives of honesty, and love to my coun 
try, according to that measure of judgment which God has 
bestowed on me, and I would not forfeit the approbation of my 
own mind for the approbation of any man, or all the men upon 
earth. My conduct as a public man, through the whole of the 
late glorious Revolution, has been such as, I trust, will administer 
comfort to me in those moments when I shall most want it, and 
smooth the bed of death. But as Shakespeare says, Something 
too much of this. 



3 14 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

The letter closes with the following postscript : 

" Send me by the first good ship to Potomac River insured, six 
half hogsheads viz. : about one hundred and eighty or ninety 
American gallons of good cogniac brandy in barrels or casks of 
about thirty gallons each, iron-bound or very well secured and 
tight, and covered each with a double empty cask to prevent 
the sailors or the craftsmen in this country from making free 
with it. Also a piece of silk, a pattern for your sister Betsy. I 
would have it a handsome but not a very expensive silk, and 
depend upon your taste in the choice of it. If trimmings are 
necessary they should be sent with it, and sewing silk to make 
it up." l 

Colonel Mason wrote from "Gunston Hall" to Washing 
ton ten days later on the subject of a coachman living with 
him, whom the latter wanted to secure. He had been in 
Colonel Mason s service, and Washington wished to know 
his character. The man, a German, came to Maryland, " and 
entered into an indenture to Colonel Fitzhugh," George 
Mason s relative, " who thereupon paid his passage over to 
serve him four years." After living two years in Maryland 
with Colonel Fitzhugh, the latter recommended him as a 
coachman to Colonel Mason, and he was found to be a good 
driver and careful of horses, but lazy and quarrelsome. His 
indenture expired in October, 1787, but he had wished to 
remain at " Gunston," and Colonel Mason gave him then 
,15 a year with his clothes. He only kept him, however, 
he tells his correspondent, because he could get no other 
coachman. No servant of his own was capable of driving, 
and this man had never attempted to teach any one of them ; 
only a small negro had " ridden one of the four horses as 
postillion." The duties of the German were to serve as 
coachman, to wait at table, occasionally work in the garden, 
take care of the stable and horses, and keep the key of the 
corn house and give out the corn. But, in fact, he did little 
more than drive and look after the horses. 2 Probably this

LETTER TO HIS SON JOHN. 315 

German coachman went from Colonel Mason s service into 
that of the new President, and drove for him the famous 
cream-colored chariot painted by Cipriani. This letter of 
March 23, 1789, is the last one of George Mason s letters to 
Washington which has been preserved. 

The following letter was written by Colonel Mason to his 
son in France : 

VIRGINIA, GUNSTON HALL, 

May 14, 1789. 
DEAR JOHN : 

I have received your several letters, one via Norfolk and two 
by the brigs Betsy and Nancy, besides the former ones, the 
receipt whereof I had before mentioned. Your brother George 
has received a letter from you of a later date, via Philadelphia, 
wherein you mention your intention to set out for Paris the 
next morning. ... I have written a long letter by this 
opportunity to Fenwick, Mason, & Company upon several inter 
esting particulars, to which I refer you, to save a repetition here. 
I observe what you mention, with respect to overshipping goods 
to some particular people ; perhaps in a few instances, now and 
then, it is difficult to avoid this, but you should avoid it as much 
as possible. The hazard is too great in large debts, and small 
debts in this country are not worth a shilling in the pound ; and 
there are some people who would otherwise ship you tobacco, 
that upon getting in your debt, will immediately discontinue their 
correspondence. But when you were mentioning with regret 
your having overshipped goods to a small amount, I am surprised 
at your silence with respect to the more important affair of Mr. 
Whitesides. This has the appearance of its having been done 
without your participation, or of your not being intimately 
acquainted with the transactions and business of the house, 
either of which may be productive of bad consequences. You 
are upon the spot, ought to know, and have a right to be con 
sulted in all important transactions. In order to entitle you 
with the greater propriety to this, you should spare no pains or 
application to make yourself well acquainted with business, so 
as to be able to take a proper share in the management, as well 
as to enable you to conduct the business of a separate house 
yourself whenever it becomes necessary, which probably may be 



316 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

soon. Notwithstanding I understand you are likely to secure 
yourselves, this affair gives me much uneasiness, for though I 
have always heard a very good character of Mr. Fenwick and 
that he is a diligent, attentive, discreet young man, yet this 
transaction shows a kind of softness and milkiness of temper 
liable to imposition, which both you and he ought to guard 
against. Pray explain this business of Mr. Whitesides, and let 
me know without reserve how it is like to terminate. ... I 
believe your Convention acquaintance, Doctor McClurg of Rich 
mond, has shipped you eight or ten hogsheads of tobacco per 
the Washington. I would have you write him particularly by 
the first convenient opportunity informing him of the prices 
current, and what articles can be advantageously imported from 
Bordeaux. It may be a means of opening you a correspondence 
from James River, as Dr. McClurg is a member of our Executive 
Council and a man of some interest in that part of the Country. 
But you should always take care to be accurate in your quota 
tions of the prices current at the time. This was not the case in 
the list of the current prices transmitted in your letters of De 
cember and January, wherein you quoted tobacco from 30 Ib to 
32 Ib per ct. instead of 28 Ib.-io. 

You are under obligations to Mr. Daniel Brent, of "Richland," 
and his brother, Mr. Richard Brent, 1 for their utmost endeavors 
to promote your interest here, and I believe to very good effect. 
Your Stafford friends have not shipped you so generally as I 
expected. One reason for this is that great part of their tobacco 
upon low grounds was destroyed by the excessive rains last sum 
mer, and another that I believe many of them are indebted to 
the Scotch stores, and there is hardly a Scotch merchant in this 
part of the country who does not wish your house at the devil. 

I hope to hear soon that you and Mr. Fenwick have got to 
housekeeping, for as your business is now grown considerable, 
and there are of course many captains of ships and others to 
whom it will be necessary for you to show civilities, I can t think 
housekeeping will be any great addition to your expences, and I 
am sure it will give some respectability to your house, besides 
that it will be much more agreeable than living in a boarding-

SHIPMENTS OF WHEAT AND TOBACCO. 317 

house. I still continue of opinion that it will be very imprudent 
in you to come to America this year, but that it will be very 
proper the year after. Indeed, the more I have reflected on this 
subject the more I am confirmed in this opinion. 

I mentioned to you in my letter by the Becky that it was not 
then in my power to ascertain the respective quantities of wheat 
shipped by me and your brothers Thomson and William. I now 
send you, on the other side, an exact statement of all the wheat 
we shipped you in the two ships, the Maryland and the Becky, 
according to which, separate accounts of sales are to be rendered 
us, notwithstanding the bills of lading for the whole may have 
been taken in my name, as I would avoid blending your brothers 
accounts with mine. You will observe that sixty-seven bushels 
of the wheat included in your brother William s quantity properly 
belongs to William Green, who, being very desirous to ship you 
something, got your brother William to include it with his, as 
the ship did not take in any wheat but from our family, except 
Forrest and Stoddert s own. For this sixty-seven bushels your 
brother William desires a separate account of sales may be 
rendered to Green, and an account rendered to himself for only 
his own proper wheat. It will also please Green mightily, which 
is some consideration, as the man seems to be much attached to 
you, and I believe intends to ship you his tobacco also. You 
will observe too that Messrs. Forrest and Stoddert are to have 
credit by me for the nett proceeds of fifty-four bushels of my 
wheat in the Becky, and my account debited accordingly, it 
being the quantity I still owe these gentlemen for what they were 
so kind to lend me. On the other side is also a duplicate of the 
list of goods I ordered in my letter per the Becky. I wish the 
brandy may arrive before the new duties take place, and I hope 
it will be of better quality than the brandy sent me last year by 
Mr. Fenwick, which, though at a very high price, is exceeding 
bad ; the man who furnished it must have been a knave, for I 
make no doubt Mr. Fenwick expected it was good and paid a 
price accordingly. The piece of silk ordered is for your sister 
Betsy, and I expect you will choose it yourself. 

I enclose you a list of the members of the new Congress, in 
both Houses, by which you will see that a considerable number 
of the Senate are our Convention acquaintance. 



318 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

I send you by Capt. Bond a barrel containing eight hams. I 
wish they may arrive in good order, as I think they were exceed 
ing good hams when they were packed up. I should be glad to 
know whether the barrel of hominy and smoked beef, by Capt. 
Rose got to hand in good order. Your brothers sent you by 
Capt. Rose two female and one male oppossum. 

We have had a mocking bird for you ever since last summer 
which is quite tame and domestic, and intended to send it out 
this spring, but it proves a female, and they seldom sing ; this 
hardly attempts a single note, and therefore we shall not send it 
abroad, to disgrace its native country. I would turn it out of the 
cage, but I am afraid its liberty, after such long confinement, 
would only make the poor thing a prey to the first hawk that 
came in its way. We will endeavor to raise some young ones this 
summer. I will also endeavor to raise a buck and doe fawn for 
you this summer. . . . The family at Gunston is reduced 
lately from a very large to a small one, consisting now only of 
your sister Betsy, your brother William, Mrs. Mason and myself. 
I most cordially wish you health and happiness, and am, dear 
John, 

Your affectionate father,

The new Federal Government went into operation March 
4, 1789, and Congress met in New York. Richard Henry 
Lee brought forward the Virginia amendments, and William 
Grayson wrote to Patrick Henry on this subject on the 2Qth 
of September : 

" With respect to amendments, matters have turned out ex 
actly as I apprehended, from the extraordinary doctrine of play 
ing the after game ; the lower House sent up amendments which

Mason and his sons in the ship Maryland, and 1298^ bushels in the Beckv. 



STEVENS THOMSON MASON. 319 

held out a safeguard to personal liberty in a great many instances, 
but this disgusted the Senate, and though we made every exertion 
to save them, they are so mutilated and gutted, that in fact they 
are good for nothing. . . . The Virginia amendments were 
all brought into view and regularly rejected. . . . Their maxim 
seems to have been to make up by construction, what the Consti 
tution wants in energy." 

Ten amendments, however, proposed at this time were made 
a part of the Constitution in 1791. They were in substance 
equivalent to some of those on the Virginia list. The tenth 
amendment, which was endorsed by the Conventions of Vir 
ginia, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina, as 
moved in the Senate by Richard Henry Lee, was in these 
words : " The powers not delegated by the Constitution to 
the United States, nor prohibited by it to the States, arc 
reserved to the States respectively." Ellsworth, of Massa 
chusetts, moved to add, " or to the people," a phrase which 
was perverted from its plain signification, " or to the people 
of the States," and used in later years as an argument against 
States-rights and the doctrine of secession. 

George Mason from his retirement at u Gunston Hall " 
must have watched with great interest the course of events 
in Congress, and the action of the Virginia Legislature upon 
these amendments. Stevens Thomson Mason was in the 
Virginia Senate, and doubtless in correspondence with his 
uncle, by whose side he had sat in the Virginia Convention 
and whose principles he had made thoroughly his own. 
With his father no longer living, and his uncle s political 
career closed, Stevens Thomson Mason represented the 
name in public life at this time, and upon him, in some sort, 
the mantle of his elders had fallen. The journal of the Virginia 
Senate records that the House, on the 8th of December, 
went into committee of the whole on the resolutions of the 
House of Delegates ratifying the amendments (twelve in 
number) proposed by Congress to the Constitution of the 

1 " Letters and Times of the Tylers," Lyon &lt; J. Tyler, vol. i., p. 165. 



32O LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

United States. They came to the following resolution : 
That the third, eighth, eleventh, and twelfth amendments 
be postponed until the next session of Assembly. The 
others were agreed to, and then the motion was made, that 
all or any members who voted for the postponement of the 
above four articles be allowed to enter upon the journal the 
reasons which influenced their vote and all or any of their 
objections. On the I2th of December this was accordingly 
done, and the entry is as follows : 

" The Senate of Virginia having determined to postpone until 
the next session of Assembly, the third, eighth, eleventh, and 
twelfth articles of the amendments to the Constitution of the 
United States, recommended by Congress, we, the underwritten 
members of the majority on that question, deem it incumbent on 
us, not only from the respect we owe to our constituents, and our 
responsibility to them, but in order to prevent doubt and mis 
representation, to enter on the Journals of the House the con 
siderations which have influenced our decision on this subject, 
and our principal objections to those articles. We are satisfied 
that the people of Virginia would never have ratified the Consti 
tution of the United States, but from a confident hope and firm 
persuasion of speedily seeing it much more materially altered 
and amended than it would be by ratifying the propositions lately 
submitted by Congress to the State Legislatures. That although 
we consider some of the amendments offered as similar, and 
others nearly equivalent, to a part of the amendments proposed 
by Virginia and other States, yet that some of them which seem 
analogous to other amendments so proposed, are not substantially 
the same and fall short of affording the same security to personal 
rights, or of so effectually guarding against the apprehended mis 
chiefs of the government ; of this description we consider the 
3rd, 8th, nth and i2th articles. We conceive that the 3rd article, 
which seems given in lieu of the i5th, i6th, igth and 2oth 
articles of the bill of rights proposed by the Virginia Conven 
tion, will not bear a comparison with these articles. The i5th 
expressly declares the right of the people to assemble together to 
consult for the common good, to instruct their representatives, 
and to petition for redress of grievances. The i6th asserts the 



AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY CONGRESS. $21 

right of the people to freedom of speech, and of writing and pub 
lishing their sentiments, and secures the liberty of the press. 
The i pth and 2oth hold sacred the rights of conscience, secure 
to every religious sect or society the most perfect equality, and 
effectually guard against any religious establishments. 

" The 3rd amendment, recommended by Congress, does not 
prohibit the rights of conscience from being violated or infringed ; 
and although it goes to restrain Congress from passing laws es 
tablishing any national religion, they might, notwithstanding, levy 
taxes to any amount, for the support of religion or its preachers ; 
and any particular denomination of Christians might be so 
favored and supported by the General Government as to give it 
a decided advantage over others, and in process of time render 
it as powerful and dangerous as if it was established as the 
national religion of the country. 

" This amendment does not declare and assert the right of the 
people to speak and publish their sentiments, nor does it secure 
the liberty of the press. Should these valuable rights be in 
fringed or violated by the arbitrary decisions of Judges, or by 
any other means than a legislative act directly to that effect, the 
people would have no avowed principle in the Constitution to 
which they might resort for the security of these rights. 

" The right of the people to instruct their representatives, and 
their right to consult with each other for the common good, seem 
too evident to be questioned in a republican government ; yet, 
these rights are denied by Congress, and they have refused to 
allow any amendment declaratory of them, as we discover by 
their Journals ; and even the humble privilege of petitioning 
against oppression is not fully asserted or secured ; as this privi 
lege may be abridged or rendered nugatory without any law upon 
the subject ; not to mention other means, it might be defeated by 
a rule of either House, without violating the 3rd article of the 
amendments. 

" This amendment then, when considered as it relates to any 
of the rights it is pretended to secure, will be found totally inade 
quate, and betrays an unreasonable, unjustifiable, but a studied 
departure from the amendment proposed by Virginia and other 
States, for the protection of their rights. We conceive that this 
amendment is dangerous and fallacious, as it tends to lull the 
apprehensions of the people on these important points, without 



322 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

affording them security ; and mischievous, because by setting 
bounds to Congress, it will be considered as the only restriction 
on their power over these rights ; and thus certain powers in the 
government, which it has been denied to possess, will be recog 
nized without being properly guarded against abuse. 

" The 8th article of the proposed amendments, so far from 
securing the valuable trial by jury of the vicinage in criminal 
prosecutions, leaves Congress the same power to abridge this 
right as they possess by the original Constitution. They have 
already by law fixed the districts co-extensive with the respective 
States ; and they will at all times possess the power of regulating 
the districts at pleasure, so that there appears to us nothing in 
this amendment to restrain government from carrying a man 
accused of a crime, out of his own neighborhood to any distance 
within the limits of a State, to be tried by strangers, perhaps 
enemies, where the advantages of this excellent mode of trial 
might be entirely defeated, and where a person obnoxious to 
Congress, might fall an innocent sacrifice to their resentment. 

" We do not find that the nth article is asked for by Virginia 
or any other State ; we therefore conceive that the people of Vir 
ginia should be consulted with respect to it, even if we did not 
doubt the propriety of adopting it ; but it appears to us highly 
exceptionable. If it is meant to guard against the extension of 
the powers of Congress by implication, it is greatly defective, and 
does by no means comprehend the idea expressed in the lyth 
article of amendments proposed by Virginia ; and as it respects 
personal rights might be dangerous, because should the rights of 
the people be invaded or called in question, they might be re 
quired to show by the Constitution what rights they have re 
tained ; and such as could not from that instrument be proved to 
be retained, they might be denied to possess. Of this there is 
ground to be apprehensive, when Congress are already seen 
denying certain rights of the people heretofore deemed clear and 
unexceptionable. 

"We conceive that the i2th article would come up to the ist 
article of the Virginia amendments, were it not for the words or 
to the people. It is not declared to be the people of the respec 
tive States ; but the expression applies to the people generally as 
citizens of the United States, and leaves it doubtful what powers 



VIRGINIA RESOLUTIONS OF DISAPPROVAL. 523 



arc reserved to the State Legislatures. Unrestrained by the Con 
stitution or these amendments, Congress might, as the supreme 
ruler of the people, assume those powers which properly belong 
to the respective States, and thus gradually effect an entire 
consolidation. 

"We consider that of the many and important amendments 
recommended by the Conventions of Virginia and other States, 
these propositions contain all that Congress are disposed to grant ; 
that all the rest are by them deemed improper, and that these are 
offered in full satisfaction of the whole : and although the ratifi 
cation of a part of the amendments that have been prayed for by 
Virginia would not absolutely preclude us from urging others, yet 
we conceive that by the acceptance of particular articles, we are 
concluded as to the points they relate to. Considering therefore 
that they are far short of what the people of Virginia wish, and 
have asked, and deeming them by no means sufficient to secure 
the rights of the people, or to render the government safe and 
desirable, we think our countrymen ought not to be put off with 
amendments so inadequate. 

That being satisfied of the defects and dangerous tendency of 
these four articles of the proposed amendments, we are con 
strained to withhold our assent to them ; but unwilling for the 
present to determine on their rejection, we think it our duty to 
postpone them until the next session of Assembly, in order 
that the people of Virginia may have an opportunity to con 
sider of them, and judge for themselves ; and that the members 
of the Legislature may be enabled to consult with, and know 
the sentiments of their constituents on the subject." 

S. T. Mason was one of the eight members of the Senate 
who signed these resolutions, which were published shortly 
afterwards in the Richmond paper. 1 The House of Dele 
gates appointed some of its members to confer with a 
delegation from the Senate on this subject, and Stevens 
Thomson Mason " was one of the three senators chosen for

January 13, 1790. 

Stevens Thomson Mason was the grandfather of Stevens Thomson Mason, 
the early " boy governor " of Michigan, one of the States carved out of Vir 
ginia s western territory.

the purpose. The Senate, on the I4th of December, ordered 
that Mr. Mason should acquaint the House of Delegates 
that they adhered to their determination not to ratify the 
amendments except in the conditional form declared by 
their resolutions. The lower House of the Virginia Legis 
lature at this session was under the influence of such Feder 
alists as General Henry Lee. But in the Senate, the coun 
sels of George Mason, of Henry, Grayson, and R. H. Lee 
bore fruit. 

Jefferson returned to America from Paris in the fall of 
1789, to take his place in Washington s Cabinet. John 
Mason had written to him offering him a passage on one of 
his vessels, early in the summer ; and Jefferson in replying, 
on the 1 6th of July, says : " I beg you to remember me in 
the most friendly terms to your father. I have put off an 
swering his letter because I expected constantly to make 
my voyage to America and to see him at his own house." 1 
He sailed from London to Norfolk in October, and visiting 
friends all along the route from Norfolk, reached " Monti- 
cello " only two days before Christmas. Setting out for New 
York on the 1st of March, 1790, Jefferson stopped, on his 
way, in Alexandria, where the mayor and citizens gave him 
a public reception. He did not, however, go to " Gunston 
Hall," owing to the badness of the roads at this season. 

On the 1 2th of March, 1790, William Grayson, the distin 
guished Virginia Senator, died at Dumfries, on his way to 
Congress, and George Mason, it was hoped, would be in 
duced to fill the vacancy. Governor Randolph wrote to 
him announcing his appointment by the Executive, as the 
Legislature was not in session : 

RICHMOND, March 25th, 1790. 
To COL. GEORGE MASON. 

SIR : I do myself the honor to enclose you a commission ap 
pointing you a senator for the State in the room of Col. Grayson 
deceased. 

1 Jefferson s " Works," H. A. Washington, vol. iii., p. 72. 



APPOINTED TO UNITED STATES SENATE. 325 

Permit me to intreat your acceptance of this commission. The 
very important subjects now before Congress, so interesting to 
America in general, and more especially to your native State, call 
for the counsels of the wisest of her citizens. 

Impressed with the fullest conviction of your abilities and zeal 
for the welfare of your country, I cannot doubt your compliance 
with the unanimous wishes of the Executive. 

I am, &c., 

BEVERLEY RANDOLPH. 

The Richmond paper of the 3ist of March announced: 
" The Hon. George Mason, Esq : is appointed a senator of 
the United States, in the room of the Hon. Col. William 
Grayson, deceased." 2 

But Colonel Mason was not to be prevailed upon to take 
the office, and Governor Randolph, on the same day issued 
the following proclamation : 

Virginia to wit : 

George Mason, Esq : who was duly chosen a senator for this 
Commonwealth in pursuance of the Constitution for the United 
States of America, having refused to act during the recess of the 
Legislature of the Commonwealth, I, Beverley Randolph, being 
governor or chief magistrate of the Commonwealth, have there 
fore thought fit and with the advice and consent of the privy 
council, or council of state, and by virtue of the said Constitution 
to appoint John Walker, Esq : to be and act as a senator for the 
Commonwealth until the next meeting of the Legislature thereof. 

Given under my hand and the seal of the Commonwealth, this 
3ist day of March, 1790. 

[SEAL.] BEVERLEY RANDOLPH. 3 

At the meeting of the Assembly in the autumn of this 
year, James Monroe was elected to fill out Grayson s term, 
and for the next succeeding six years.

326 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



Colonel Mason alludes to his appointment to the Senate 
in the following letter to his son : 

VIRGINIA, GUNSTON HALL, 
May 20th, 1790. 

DEAR JOHN : 

I take the opportunity per the ship Confidence Capt. de Bore, 
to send you, via Havre de Grace (where the ship is to touch for 
orders) a duplicate of my letter of the 2yth of April last via New 
Yoik, together with a duplicate of my letter of the same date, 
and by the same route, to Messrs. Fenwick, Mason, & Company, 
covering the first bill of a letter of exchange on Messrs : Thomas 
Clagett & Company merchants in London for ^500 sterling, 
payable to me, and by me endorsed to your house. I now 
enclose the second bill of the same etc. 

Capt. Fenwick has been obliged to charter the ship Confidence 
at a very low freight rather than send her back (unchartered) in 
ballast, which has been the fate of many of the ships sent out to 
America for wheat and flour, and has reduced freights this year 
lower than ever they were known before. My reason for remit 
ting the above mentioned second bill by this conveyance, via 
Havre de Grace, is, that it is uncertain when your ship the Wash 
ington will be ready to sail. I fear it will be very difficult to pro 
cure a load for her ; for the confusion and uncertain state of 
affairs in France makes people cautious of venturing their prop 
erty there, which together with the low price of tobacco at that 
market last fall, discourages everybody from shipping thither, and 
it will not answer to purchase on your own accounts, tobacco 
now selling here from i8/ to 2o/ per hundred Virginia currency 
and expected to be higher, at the same time that exchange for 
bills on London is at 15 to 20 per ct. 



I heartily wish the French nation success in establishing their 
new government, upon the principles of liberty, and the sacred 
rights of human nature ; but I dread the consequences of their 
affairs remaining so long in an unsettled state. Their finances, 
their commerce, and some of their most important interests must 
suffer exceedingly by it ; besides the risk of the most respectable 
part of the people (which is always found in the middle walks of 



LETTERS TO HIS SON JOHN. $2? 

life) being disgusted and worn down with so long a scene of doubt 
and uncertainty, not to say anarchy. 

I have lately been appointed a senator for the commonwealth 
of Virginia, in the Senate of the United States, but have refused 
to serve. 

Your affectionate father, 

G. MASON. 
John Mason, Esquire, 

Merchant in Bordeaux. 1 

In this letter Colonel Mason speaks of having " just 
recovered from a three months fit of the gout," and doubt 
less his state of health had something to do with his deter 
mination to remain in private life. He wrote again to his 
son about two weeks later : 

VIRGINIA, GUNSTON HALL, 

June 3, 1790. 
DEAR JOHN : 

This will be delivered you by your partner Mr. Joseph Fen- 
wick, and as he proposes going by land to Boston, and embark 
ing from thence, or from Portsmouth in New Hampshire, it will 
hardly come to your hands before the latter end of September, 
before which it is probable I shall have other different oppor 
tunities of writing to you. Mr. Fenwick s long stay in America, 
and the necessity you will be under of staying in Bordeaux, some 
time after his arrival, to adjust and fully settle your affairs, so as 
to take away all cause for any confusion or dispute hereafter, 
will, I fear, prevent your embarking for America this year ; 
unless you can get a passage to South Carolina, so as to arrive 
there in the month of November, for I would wish you to avoid 
a winter passage, especially after your late long ill state of health. 
And therefore 1 think you had better stay in France until next 
spring, than risk passage in the depth of winter ; more particu 
larly if you come to any of the northern or middle States. 
Should you spend this winter in France, and find Bordeaux still 
disagree with your constitution, I would advise you to go to 

1 MS. Letter. 



328 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

Marseilles, or some place in the south [of] France, and return to 
Bordeaux in the spring ; as you will probably not meet with a 
passage from any of the ports in the Mediterranean, and even if 
you could, the danger of falling into the hands of the Algerines 
is such a shocking circumstance, as I would have you by all 
means avoid. 

I would strongly recommend your availing yourself of every 
means and opportunity of making yourself acquainted with the 
commercial customs of France, and what of their produce or 
manufactures will suit the respective States here, and can be 
imported upon advantageous terms, so as to be able to give satis 
factory information to the merchants in our different sea port 
towns, which you will find of infinite advantage to your house, 
when you make the tour you propose through the United States ; 
which I still think it will be proper for you to do. 

Adieu, my dear John, and believe me, 

Your most affectionate father, 

G. MASON. 
John Mason, Esq : 

Merchant in Bordeaux. 1 

Colonel Mason had written to Jefferson recommending 
Mr. Fenwick as consul to Bordeaux, and Jefferson replied as 
follows : 

NEW YORK, June 13, 1790. 

DEAR SIR : I have deferred acknowledging the receipt of 
your favor of March i6th, expecting daily that the business of 
the consulships would have been finished. But this was delayed 
by the President s illness, and a very long one of my own, so 
that it is not till within these two or three days that it has been 
settled. That of Bordeaux is given to Mr. Fenwick, according 
to your desire. The commission is making out, and will be 
signed to-morrow or next day. 

I intended fully to have had the pleasure of seeing you at 
Gunston Hall on my way here, but the roads being so bad that 
I was obliged to leave my own carriage to get along as it could, 
and to take my passage in the stage, I could not deviate from the 

1 Mason Papers. 



JEFFERSON TO GEORGE MASON. 329 

stage road. I should have been happy in a conversation with you 
on the subject of our new government, of which, though I approve 
of the mass, I would wish to see some amendments, further than 
those which have been proposed, and fixing it more surely on a 
republican basis. I have great hopes that pressing forward with 
constancy to these amendments, they will be obtained before the 
want of them will do any harm. To secure the ground we gain, 
and gain what more we can, is, I think, the wisest course. I 
think much has been gained by the late Constitution ; for the 
former was terminating in anarchy, as necessarily consequent to 
inefficiency. 

The House of Representatives have voted to remove to Balti 
more, by a majority of 53 against 6. This was not the effect of 
choice, but of confusion into which they had been brought by the 
event of other questions, and their being hampered with the rules 
of the House. It is not certain what will be the vote of the 
Senate. Some hope an opening will be given to convert it into 
a vote of the temporary seat at Philadelphia, and the permanent 
one at Georgetown. The question of assumption will be brought 
on again, and its event is doubtful. Perhaps its opponents would 
be wiser to be less confident in their success, and to compromise 
by agreeing to assume the State debts still due to individuals, so 
as to put the States in the shoes of those of their creditors whom 
they have paid off. Great objections lie to this, but not so great 
as an assumption of the unpaid debts only. My duties preventing 
me from mingling in these questions, I do not pretend to be very 
competent to their decision. In general, I think it necessary to 
give as well as take in a government like ours. 

I have some hope of visiting Virginia in the fall, in which case 
I shall still flatter myself with the pleasure of seeing you ; in the 
meantime, I am with unchanged esteem and respect, my dear sir, 
Your most obedient friend and servant. ! 

Jefferson on his return to " Monticello " in September 
travelled again in his own carriage, Madison with him, 
stopping two days at " Mount Vernon," and it is highly 
probable he visited " Gunston Hall " at this time. George 
Mason in this year, or perhaps a little earlier, resigned the 

1 "Jefferson s Works," II. A. Washington, vol. iii., p. 147. 



330 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

office of justice of the peace, which he had probably held 
since his early manhood. His name is given, with those of 
Washington, McCarty, Bryan Fairfax, and others, in a list 
preserved of the justices of Fairfax County in 1770. Twenty 
years later the records state that on the 2ist of June, 1790, 
the clerk of the court of Fairfax County, after certifying 
that the court recommended George Augustine Washington 
and others for magistrates, gave a list of justices, and those 
marked removed, dead, etc., as a true statement of the 
justices of the county : 

" Robert Townsend Hooe, sheriff ; George Mason, resigned ; 
Alexander Henderson, removed ; Charles Broadwater, dead ; 
George Washington, president ; Martin Cockburn, resigned ; 
Richard Chichester, resigned ; James Waugh, resigned."" 

Jefferson in his letter to George Mason had referred to 
the question of assumption then before Congress. It was 
one of the " fiscal manoeuvres " of Alexander Hamilton, 
which was believed to be a violation of the Constitution, 
and injurious to many of the States. The debts of the 
several Commonwealths were put down, on a rough estimate, 
as twenty millions, and the people generally assessed to pay 
this amount, whereas some States had a greater, some a less, 
indebtedness than others, and the law thus acted unfairly 
upon them. It was discovered also after the accounts were 
settled, that the estimate had been much too large. Eleven 
millions would have been sufficient, but by the operation of 
the Assumption Act, an additional debt was created, reaching 
in a few years to over ten millions. 3 The Virginia Assembly 
in December, 1790, sent a memorial to Congress protesting 
against this measure. They declare that " neither policy, 
justice, nor the Constitution warrants it " ; that a large por 
tion of the debt is already redeemed by the collection of 
heavy taxes, but by this act " a heavy debt and consequently

3 Randall s " Life of Jefferson," vol. i., p. 608. 



VIRGINIA OPPOSES ASSUMPTION ACT. 331 



heavy taxes will be entailed on the citizens of this Common 
wealth from which they can never be relieved by all the 
efforts of the General Assembly, whilst any part of the debts 
contracted by any State in the American Union, and so 
assumed, shall remain unpaid." The act without the smallest 
necessity, as they averred, extorted from the General Assem 
bly the power of taxing their own constituents for the pay 
ment of their own debts, in such a manner as would be best 
suited to their own ease and convenience, etc. Another 
light in which it appeared more odious and deformed " was 
this : During the discussions of the Federal Constitution, 
they, the memorialists, were taught to believe " that every 
power not expressly granted was retained." Under this 
impression they ratified the Constitution, but there was no 
clause in the Constitution authorizing Congress in express 
terms to assume the debts of the States. 1 Stevens Thomson 
Mason as a member of the Virginia Senate endorsed these 
views, which were those also of his illustrious uncle. 

On the loth of January, 1791, George Mason wrote two 
letters, one to his son John, and one giving the news he had 
received from France to his friend Thomas Jefferson. 
Unfortunately the less important of these two epistles is 
the only one of them that has been preserved. The one to 
Jefferson has been lost, and it is only through the latter s 
reply that anything can be known of its contents. Colonel 
Mason s letter to his son is as follows : 

GUNSTON HALL, January 10, 1791. 
DEAR JOHN : 

As I presume you have left Bordeaux before this time, and that 
this letter may probably find you in the south of France, I enclose 
you a copy of my letter of this date to Fenwick, Mason, and Com 
pany to save myself the trouble of repeating its contents sepa 
rately to you. This leaves me little more to add except telling 
you that if the Washington sails in time, I shall send you, as you 
desire, letters of introduction to some of my friends in South 
Carolina, particularly to Col. William Washington, a gentleman 
1 Journal of the Assembly.

for whom I have the greatest regard, and with whom you were too 
young to be acquainted when he went into the army. I have the 
pleasure to inform you that all your brothers and sisters are well, 
as is also the family at Gunston Hall. Mrs. Mason returns you 
many thanks for your acceptable present of the political fan, and 
gloves, and joins in our best wishes and respects to you, with, dear 
John, 

Your affectionate father, 

G. MASON. 

Jefferson wote to George Mason, in answer to his letter of 
the loth of January : 

PHILADELPHIA, February 4, 1791. 
DEAR SIR : 

I am to make you my acknowledgments for your favor of 
January loth, and the information from France which it con 
tained. It confirmed what I had heard more loosely before, and 
accounts still more recent are to the same effect. I look with 
great anxiety for the firm establishment of the new government in 
France, being perfectly convinced that if it takes place there, it 
will spread sooner or later all over Europe. On the contrary 
a check there would retard the revival of liberty in other coun 
tries. I consider the establishment and success of their govern 
ment as necessary to stay up our own, and to prevent it from 
falling back to that kind of a half-way house, the English Consti 
tution. It cannot be denied that we have among us a sect who 
believe that to contain whatever is perfect in human institutions; 
that the members of this sect have many of them names and 
offices which stand high in the estimation of our countrymen. I 
still rely that the great mass of our community is untainted with 
these heresies, as is its head. On this I build my hope that we have 
not labored in vain, and that our experiment will still prove that 
men can be governed by reason. 

You have excited my curiosity in saying there is a particular 
circumstance, little attended to, which is continually sapping the 
republicanism of the United States. What is it ? 

What is said in our country of the fiscal arrangements now 
going on ? I really fear their effect when I consider the present

temper of the Southern States. Whether these measures be right 
or wrong abstractedly, more attention should be paid to the gen 
eral opinion. However, all will pass the Excise will pass the 
Bank will pass. The only corrective of what is corrupt in our 
present form of government, will be the augmentation of the 
numbers in the lower House, so as to get a more agricultural rep 
resentation, which may put that interest above that of the stock 
jobbers. 

I had no occasion to sound Mr. Madison on your fears 
expressed in your letter. I knew before, as possessing his senti 
ments fully on that subject, that his value for you was undimin- 
ished. I have always heard him say that though you and he 
appeared to differ in your systems, yet you were in truth nearer 
together than most persons who were classed under the same 
appellation. You may quiet yourself in the assurance of posses 
sing his complete esteem. 

I have been endeavoring to obtain some little distinction for 
our useful customers, the French. But there is a particular inter 
est opposed to it, which I fear will prove too strong. We shall 
soon see. I will send you a copy of a report I have given in as 
soon as it is printed. I know there is one part of it contrary to 
your sentiments ; yet I am not sure you will not become sensible 
that a change should be slowly preparing. 

Certainly, whenever I pass your road, I shall do myself the 
pleasure of turning into it. Our last year s experiment, however, 
is much in favor of that by Newgate. 

I am with great respect and esteem, dear Sir, 

Your friend and servant. 

No doubt Jefferson received later an explanation of the 
remark which so excited his curiosity, " the particular circum 
stance, little attended to, which is continually sapping the 
republicanism of the United States." But for us there is 
no answer to the query, though we may surmise that it had 
reference to the powers given the Federal courts. The Judi 
ciary Act of 1/89, which created the inferior United States 
courts and so greatly extended the jurisdiction of the 

1 " Jefferson s Works," H. A. Washington, vol. iii., p. 209. 



334 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

Supreme Court, doubtless filled George Mason with alarm. 
The fears he expresses to Jefferson lest Madison might be 
estranged from him, it is pleasant to know, admitted of a 
satisfactory reply. More and more as the years went on, 
and the younger statesman watched the issue of the work in 
which he and Mason had both been leaders, must Madison 
have understood that they were "nearer together" in their 
systems than many who were classed as of one party. Or 
rather Mason s system was to be acknowledged by Madison 
within a decade as that on which the liberties of his country 
men depended. The report to which Jefferson refers was 
delivered on the ist of February, 1791, and related to the cod 
and whale fisheries. 1 

The following letters were written in April and July to 
John Mason who was about to return to America: 

VIRGINIA, GUNSTON HALL, 

April i6th, 1791. 
DEAR JOHN : 

Enclosed is a letter (to which I refer) written in January and 
intended to have been sent via Baltimore or Philadelphia, but 
hearing of no ships from either of those places to Bordeaux, it is 
now sent per the Washington. She has been so long detained 
here by the winter s frost, by having considerable repairs made 
to her, and above all by the difficulty of procuring a load of 
tobacco for her, in the unsettled and uncertain state of the 
tobacco trade in France, that I think it probable you may have 
embarked for America before her arrival at Bordeaux ; neverthe 
less as you may perhaps have waited her arrival, I enclose you 
some letters of introduction to my friends in Charles Town, 
South Carolina, which you will seal and deliver if you take that 
route, though I think it a bad season of the year to come to that 
warm country, and you will have a very fatiguing journey from 
thence to Virginia, in the latter end of the summer, which may 
be injurious to your health after your long indisposition. I 
therefore really think if you expect to arrive in America before 
the beginning or middle of September you had better take your

LETTERS TO JOHN MASON. 335 

passage to some of the Northern or Eastern States, and make a 
tour to the Southern States in the course of next winter, and if 
you purpose to establish a house in the commission line upon 
Potomac River, your principal American consignments here will 
be from the Eastern States, and therefore a tour through their 
principal sea port towns, on your way home, in order to settle a 
correspondence, may be an object of importance. However with 
respect to your embarking for one of the Southern or Eastern 
States, the season of the year, in which you expect to arrive will 
be your best guide. I have shipped per the Washington thirty- 
three hogsheads of tobacco. 

I have received your letters dated in October and November 
last, and rejoice to hear that your health is in a great measure 
restored. I rejoice also to hear that I have been mistaken in my 
opinion respecting the paper money, yet I think it was founded 
on reason as well as experience ; but really the French Revolu 
tion from the beginning has been attended with such extraordi 
nary circumstances that the mr,n who judges of it by comparison 
with anything else in the annals of mankind, will probably find 
himself mistaken. 

No doubt you have heard that an act of Congress has passed 
for fixing the permanent seat of government of the Union, after 
ten years, upon [the] Potomac, at such place as the President 
should direct, between the mouth of the Eastern Branch and the 
mouth of Conogochieg (about sixty miles from each other) with 
the power of laying off ten miles square for the jurisdiction of 
Congress, and fixing the spot for the public buildings, confining 
the public buildings, however, to the eastern side of the river. 
The President has had the ten miles square laid off in the follow 
ing manner. Beginning on the upper side of the mouth of 
Great Hunting Creek and running north-west ten miles (which 
includes the town of Alexandria), thence north-east ten miles 
(which crosses Potomac River a little above the Little Falls, and 
includes all my tract of land there of about two thousand acres), 
thence south-east ten miles (which includes George Town and 
the navigable part of the Eastern Branch), thence south-west to 
the beginning. He has also directed the city for the seat of 
government, within the said ten miles square, to be laid off in 
the following manner. Beginning on Potomac River on the 



336 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

lower side the mouth of Rock Creek (just below George Town) 
thence with the meanders of Potomac River to the mouth of the 
Eastern Branch and up the meanders of the Eastern Branch 
about two miles to a point called (I think) Evan s Ferry, thence 
a course to strike the main road from George Town to Bladens- 
burg about half a mile from the ford, thence with the main road 
to the ford of Rock Creek, and with the meanders of Rock Creek 
to the beginning. These last boundaries contain about four 
thousand acres, and the proprietors, I understand, have agreed to 
give up the whole of the land (reserving the right of selling the 
wood on it) to defray the charge of the public buildings, &c, 
on condition of being paid the value of their houses and receiv 
ing again respectively half the lots after the town is laid off 
and the streets adjusted. The spot for the public buildings 
(which is the most important point) is not yet fixed. The Alex 
andrians, as usual, are very much buoyed up on the occasion 
and think their fortunes made forever, although it is evident 
to any cool, impartial, sensible man, that if the inland navi 
gation of Potomac and Shenandoah is effectually completed 
and the seat of the federal government fixed near the harbor 
of the Eastern Branch, Alexandria must become a deserted 
village. 

Adieu my dear son ; this, I expect will be the last opportunity 
I shall have of writing to you while you are in Europe. God bless 
you and send you safe to your native country and friends. I hope 
I shall soon have the pleasure of seeing you, and assuring you 
personally, how much I am 

Your affectionate father, 

G. MASON. 

P. S. Your friends here are all well, except your sister Cooke s 
children, who are under inoculation for the small-pox, but I believe 
are in a good way. We shall begin to inoculate here and at 
" Lexington " about the end of May.

JAMES RIVER MERCHANTS. 337 

GUNSTON HALL, July 12, 1791. 
DEAR JOHN : 

I did not receive your letter of the i3th of May via Nantes, 
until Saturday the pth instant, after that day s post had passed, 
so that I had no opportunity of conveying a letter to Norfolk, until 
this day s post. Herewith you will receive a packet (containing 
several letters) which I have put under cover to Mr. John Brent/ 
as you desired, and hope it will be in time ; but should you have 
arrived, and have left Norfolk, before my packet reaches the 
hands of Mr. Brent, I have desired him to send it immediately 
after you (per post) to Petersburg or Richmond. The letters are 
all left open for your perusal ; you will easily distinguish which 
are intended as complimentary introductions, merely to entitle 
you to civilities, and those which may be of use to you in the line 
of business, or in making you acquainted with the most respecta 
ble merchants, for I have myself so little acquaintance with the 
James River merchants, that I am not able to recommend such 
as it may be proper for you to confide in. Most of my letters 
are to gentlemen in Richmond ; since the death of my worthy 
friend Colo. Bland, I have no intimate acquaintance nearer Peters 
burg than Colo. Heth and Mr. David Ross. Colo. Heth having 
been some years a member of the executive council in Richmond, 
and having married some years ago in the neighborhood of 
Petersburg, and lived there a good while, and from his office of 
collector of the upper district of James River, must be as well 
acquainted with the situation, and character of all the merchants 
there as any man in Virginia. I believe he lives near Cabbin 
Point, or at Bermuda Hundred. You will find him a man of 
information and good sense, and I am sure his friendship for me 
will induce him to do you every service in his power ; and I think 
you can confide in any information he gives you. Mr. Ross is 
also a particular friend of mine, and I think will be ready to do 
you any good offices in his power. I have also received many 
instances of civility from Mr. Alexander, who is a very intelligent 
man, and well acquainted with business. He resided many years 
in France, and is perfectly acquainted with that country ; but he 
is a Scotchman, and has the character of an artful, designing man. 
With this caution, I think he may be serviceable to you, and if it 
1 John Brent was a nephew of Mrs. Mason s. 



338 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

does not in any way interfere with his own interest, I make no 
doubt will take pleasure in being so ; and I think his acquaint 
ance is well worth your cultivating. Mr. David Ross is well 
acquainted with all the merchants upon James River, and is 
generally thought to understand commerce better than any man in 
the State. He is a man of uncommon penetration, and depth of 
understanding and judgment, by which he has acquired immense 
possessions, but is said to be very much in debt. He is a very 
plain man in his manners, and I have always found him a very 
friendly man, but he too is a Scotchman. I thought it necessary, 
however, to give you the outlines of his character. Mr. Ross 
spends as much of his time in Richmond as in Petersburg. 

The Governor, Colo. Harvie, and Mr. Marshall are all very 
worthy men, and intimate friends of mine, but they have never 
been in any mercantile line, though they may be serviceable to 
you, in making you acquainted with the most respectable mer 
chants, and in promoting connections with the country gentle 
men, if you have a mind to form such. Mr. Hopkins has been 
many years a commissioner of the Continental Loan Office. He 
is well acquainted with everybody in that part of the country, has 
been concerned in trade, is a man of good sense, and has always 
supported a good character. 

It is proper to inform you that Colo. Wood s, the Lieutenant 
Governor s lady is a distant relation, a second cousin of ours, 
and the daughter of the late Reverend Mr. Moncure, the most 
valuable friend I ever had in my life. 

Should you have occasion to lodge money any time in Rich 
mond, the iron chests in the public treasury will be the safest 
place. Colo. Harvie is a very intimate friend of Mr. Ambler, the 
treasurer, and Mr. Marshall married one of his daughters ; either 
of these gentlemen can procure you leave to do so. The present 
price of tobacco at Richmond and Petersburg I am told is from 
J 7 /6 to 20 / Virginia currency, upon Potomac 13 /, and I 
believe almost any quantity could readily be bought here at 14 / 
or at most 15 /. It is unfortunate you did not, immediately 
upon the decree with respect to tobacco, charter and send out a 
French ship or two. If you had at this instant three or four 
French ships in the Potomac, they could be readily loaded upon 



FRIENDS IN RICHMOND. 339 

consignment ; but I doubt you have lost the time and that it is now 
too late to send orders for that purpose to France, as I have rea 
son to believe several of the merchants here have advised their 
correspondents in Europe to charter French ships as speedily as 
they can. 

Pray write to me as soon as you arrive ; a letter per post will 
reach me in four or five days from Norfolk, and in two or three 
from Richmond. I long to see you exceedingly, and so do all 
your brothers and sisters ; yet I think if you load the ship in 
James River, you had better not leave that part of the country, 
until you despatch her. 

Your brother George is in much better health than he has 
been for two years past. He thinks he received much benefit, 
last summer, from the use of the Augusta Springs. He and your 
brother William spend this season there also. They set out the 
day before yesterday, and don t intend to return before Sep 
tember. 

I wish to hear as soon as possible how your health is, and what 
effect the voyage has had upon it ; I hope a good one, and am, 
dear John, 

Your most affectionate father, 

G. MASON. 1 

Of the friends and acquaintances spoken of by Colonel 
Mason in this letter, several will be recognized as prominent 
names of contemporary statesmen. Colonel Bland, George 
Mason s ally in the Convention, though a silent one ; " Mr. 
Marshall," his able antagonist, who as Chief Justice was to 
do so much later towards moulding the plastic form of the 
new Confederation into its permanent shape, and giving it 
that bias towards consolidation so much to be deplored ; 
and Colonel Harvie, a member of the Continental Congress, 
who was long a resident of Richmond, and afterwards 
removed to " Belvidere," the beautiful country-seat of the 
Byrds on James River. David Ross was a Scotch merchant 
who acquired a large landed property in various parts of 
Virginia s broad domain, and was the original owner of the

flour mills in Richmond afterwards belonging to the Haxalls. 
His house, a wooden building on a cliff overlooking the 
James River, was still standing in 1860. Mr. Jacqueline 
Ambler, the Treasurer, was a son of Richard Ambler of York- 
town, who had been a friend and correspondent of Colonel 
Mason s mother. And Colonel Wood was connected with him 
by marriage, as he has said. Extracts from a letter of Mrs. 
Wood s have been given in a former chapter. Councillor 
Carter wrote two letters to George Mason in August, 1791, 
asking him " to sit as referee " in a case where his (Robert 
Carter s) action as trustee of his father-in-law s estate had 
been called in question. " The representatives " [the family 
of Mrs. Elizabeth Lowndes of Bladensburg, a daughter, as 
was Mrs. Carter, of the Hon. Benjamin Tasker], writes Colo 
nel Carter, " are dissatisfied with my conduct in the business 
mentioned before, and we have mutually chosen you to 
hear and determine the matter of right." The 2Oth of Sep 
tember was named as the time appointed for the decision, 
which date apparently interfered with business of Colonel 
Mason s, and his correspondent therefore proposed that the 
former should appoint " both time and place for the hearing 
of the matter."

CHAPTER X. 

CONCLUSION. 
1791-1792. 

The new government had not been long in operation be 
fore the contingency anticipated by George Mason in respect 
to the Indiana Company arose the company bringing up 
its claim against Virginia. There were other land schemes 
agitated at this time also, such as the project of Morgan 
and Gardoqui, which were calculated to affect seriously 
Virginia s interests, and which were closely watched by her 
representatives in Congress. 1 Colonel Morgan issued a hand 
bill, " inviting a settlement under the authority of Spain at 
New Madrid, near the mouth of the Ohio, on the Spanish 
side," as William Grayson writes Patrick Henry in 1789. 
The colonists were promised the free navigation of the Mis 
sissippi, and a market at New Orleans free from duties for 
all the produce of their lands. Morgan was a member of 
the Indiana Company, and at the session of the Virginia 
Assembly, October, 1791, he presented a " memorial of the 
proprietors and share-holders of a tract of land called 
Indiana." It set forth " that in the year 1776 they did 
inform the General Assembly of the title to the said tract 
of land, by a memorial then presented to them ; that al 
though the legislature did afterward direct the said land to 
be sold for the benefit of the State, and did refuse to allow 
the memorialists any compensation therefor yet they are 
convinced that this proceeded from a want of information 

1 " Virginia Calendar Papers," vol. iv., p. 534. 
341 



342 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

not then attainable ; and praying that their right to the said 
land may be investigated in the manner most satisfactory to 
the General Assembly, and in case it is established, that such 
compensation may be made to them therefor, as is consist 
ent with equity." 1 Roger West, one of the delegates in the 
Assembly from Fairfax County, consulted George Mason as 
to the course to be pursued, and the latter replied in the 
following letter, from which extracts have been given in a 
preceding chapter. 

GUNSTON HALL, November gth, 1791. 
DEAR SIR : 

Your favor of the 4th did not come to my hands until last 
night, and the post leaving Colchester early to-morrow morning 
does not leave me time to answer you upon so important a sub 
ject as the Indiana claim, either to your satisfaction or to my own. 
I have searched all my papers, endeavoring to find my former 
argument in the Assembly, when I was appointed to collect the 
evidence and manage the business on behalf of the Common 
wealth, which (if I could have found it) would have given the 
fullest information, but I imagine I must have lent it to some 
member of the Assembly, who has never returned it, and con 
ceiving the matter after so full an investigation and positive de 
termination as it then had, forever at an end, I was the less 
careful in preserving my notes and papers. Several depositions 
were then produced and some witnesses examined at the bar of 
the House, proving the mysterious and clandestine conduct of 
Sir William Johnston (the King s agent) at the treaty at Fort 
Stanwix, when the Indiana Company obtained their deed from 
the Indians. The council books were also produced, in which 
were many entries, previous to the Indiana Company s purchase, 
for lands much further to the westward. The Indiana Company s 
deed from the Indians was set aside and a declaratory act passed 
upon the subject, as well as my memory serves me, in the May 
session of 1779, principally upon the following points. First, the 
purchase of the same lands from the Six Nations of Indians, at 
the treaty of Lancaster in the year 1744, for the use of Virginia, 
and paid for with our money. The book containing the records 

1 Journal of the Assembly. 



LETTER TO ROGER WEST. 343 

of this treaty and the deed of purchase was then produced, but I 
have understood has been since destroyed, as well as all the other 
Indian treaties, made here under the king s government, with the 
books and papers of the council and of the Committee of Safety, 
when General Arnold s troops burned the foundry at Westham 
in which they had been placed upon the enemy s marching tow 
ards Richmond. Second, because the Six Nations, who claimed 
the lands by conquest, had lost their title (even if they had not 
sold them at the treaty of Lancaster) by the same means by which 
they first gained it conquest their tributaries and tenants, the 
Shawnese and Delawares, with a mixture of the Six Nations 
having been expelled, and driven over the Ohio (from whence 
they never returned) and the lands on this side the Ohio con 
quered in the war which happened a little before the Indiana 
Company s purchase. Third, independent of the above reasons, 
the deed to the Indiana Company by the law of Virginia ought 
to have been recorded (like all other deeds) either in the county 
where the land lay, as in Augusta, which was the then frontier 
county of Virginia, or in the General Court, that for the want of 
this the deed (if there had been no other objection) was void as 
to all subsequent purchasers, and that the settlers upon the land 
under Virginia titles, of which there were a great many before 
the deed was recorded in Augusta, were in the equitable con 
struction of the law, to be considered as purchasers. Fourth, 
because the consideration of the deed was a compensation to the 
Indian traders, for the losses they had suffered, and it was 
thought they had no more right to require compensation than a 
merchant who had his ship taken by an enemy s privateer, or any 
other sufferer in the common calamities of war. Fifth, because 
the traders to whom the Indian deed was made, being every one 
of them citizens of Pennsylvania, from which this trade with the 
Indians was carried on, if they had been entitled to compensation 
at all, ought to have had such compensation out of the lands 
under the chartered territory of Pennsylvania (for whose benefit 
the trade had been carried on, by her own citizens) and not out 
of the lands of Virginia, and this appeared in the strongest, or if 
I may be allowed the expression, more barefaced point of view 
as Pennsylvania had at that same treaty of Fort Stanwix made a 
large purchase from the Indians of lands within her own charter. 



3/|/| LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

I presume the legislature cannot regularly give any decision in 
favor of the Indiana Company without repealing the before men 
tioned declaratory act, and the consequences of such a repeal 
may extend much further and produce effects which may not at 
first be foreseen. Among other things it would certainly open a 
door to the revival of Col. Henderson s and Company s claim to 
Kentucky, nor can any man tell when it would end. 

In my humble opinion the matter s having been fully investigated, 
the Indiana Company heard by their counsel at the bar of the House, 
a dozen years ago, when there was much better evidence both 
written and oral, than can now possibly be had, and a solemn 
determination then made, is a sufficient reason against giving 
any decision upon it now, when some of the witnesses are dead, 
some removed we don t know where, and when even the record 
evidence has been destroyed in the events of the late war. The 
present applicant Mr. Morgan is entitled to as Yf\\\c\\ justice as any 
other man, but surely a man who has endeavored to depopulate 
the United States by seducing their citizens to quit their own 
country and settle in the Spanish territory has little pretensions 
to favor from us. 

I have thus, sir, given you the best information upon the subject 
the short time I had would allow. I remember the Indiana Com 
pany when their claim at their own request was before the Assem 
bly in 1779 produced in Williamsburg some English lawyers 
opinions in their favor, upon a printed state of their case. To 
show you (and if you think fit the Assembly) what sort of opinions 
the English lawyers were accustomed to give, when the poor 
American colonies and their rights were in question, I enclose 
you an opinion of Mr. Attorney-General Pratt s in the year 1760 
upon a dispute between the then proprietor of Maryland and the 
people. Yet this is the same Mr. Pratt who has been since trans 
formed into Lord Camden, the champion of liberty and the 
defender of the rights of the people. I have long kept it as a 
curiosity, you will therefore be pleased to take care of it and 
return it to me. 

I thank you exceedingly for getting Mr. John Hooe s petition 
for a ferry postponed until the petition against it comes down. 
It is still out among the people of this county, but I will endeavor 
to get it as soon as possible and forward it to the Assembly, and 



SUIT BROUGHT BY INDIANA COMPANY. 345 

have no doubt it will prove Mr. Hooe s projected new ferry not 
only unnecessary but productive of much injury and oppression 
to the people in its consequences, and calculated merely to serve 
a local job. 

I am with great respect, dear Sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

GEORGE MASON. 
Roger West, Esq: 

Now upon the General Assembly in Richmond. 1 

The Indiana Company brought suit in the United States 
Court against Virginia, and the Assembly of 1792 pronounced 
upon the illegality of this proceeding. The committee, after 
quoting from the journal of the Assembly for June 9, 17/9, 
to show that the claim had been already decided, passed the 
following resolution : 

" That the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United 
States does not and cannot extend to this case, it already having 
been decided on before a tribunal fully competent to its decision ; 
that the State cannot be made a defendant in the said court, at 
the suit of any individual or individuals ; and that the executive 
be requested to pursue such measures in this case, as may seem 
most conducive to the interest, honor, and dignity of this Com 
monwealth." 3 

The claim had been prosecuted by the company for 
twenty-nine years at an expense of over eighteen thousand 
dollars, and it involved a tract of country embracing nearly 
three millions of acres. 3 Its final overthrow was a benefit 
both to Virginia and to the Union. 

The opinion of Attorney-General Pratt, afterwards Lord 
Camden, to which George Mason refers, is doubtless the one 
given by him sustaining the claims made in 1757, by the 
upper House of the Maryland Assembly to the appointment 
of officers and the supervision of the acts of the lower 

1 Mason Papers. 

3 Hening s " Statutes," vol. xiii. 

3 " Virginia Calendar Papers," vol. vi. 



346 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

House. The upper House was the Council and consisted of 
the appointees and creatures of the proprietor, Lord Balti 
more. The opinion of the English lawyer concluded with 
these words : 

" The Upper House should take care how they admit encroach 
ments of this kind, when they are supported by arguments drawn 
from the exercise of the like rights in the Commons here. The 
constitutions of the two assemblies differ fundamentally in many 
respects. Our House of Commons stands upon its own laws ; 
whereas Assemblies in the colonies are regulated by their respec 
tive charters, usages, and the common law of England, and will 
never be allowed to assume those which the House of Commons 
are justly entitled to here, upon principles that neither can nor 
must be applied to the colonies." 

Mr. John Hooe s proposed new ferry was to have been 
across the Occoquan River. And it seems, from the fact 
that it was not established, that George Mason s views con 
trolled the action of the Assembly. It was in this year, 
1791, that Colonel Mason wrote his last political paper. It 
relates to the division into Congressional districts. Virginia 
had been divided into ten districts by the act of 1788. Of 
these George Mason s district embraced the six counties of 
Prince William, Stafford, Loudoun, Fairfax, King George* 
and Fauquier. It is proposed, writes George Mason, at the 
next Assembly to lay off the State into twenty-one Con 
gressional districts. " The five counties of Stafford, Prince 
William, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Fauquier (leaving out the 
county of King George, to be added to some of the lower 
counties) will now form two complete districts, and it will be 
attempted to make Fairfax and Loudoun compose one of 
these two districts ; and Stafford, Prince William, and Fau 
quier compose the other district ; by which means the sub 
stance of the right of suffrage, in electing members of 
Congress will be taken from the people of Fairfax, and the 

1 Scharf s " History of Maryland," vol. i., p. 503. 



VIRGINIA CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS. 347 

name or shadow only left them." He gives his reasons for 
believing that such a result will follow, and in a footnote 
states what he thinks is the real motive of the " nefarious 
project." This was to secure the election of Richard Bland 
Lee, a Federalist. Colonel Mason s suggestion is that the 
three small counties, Stafford, Prince William, and Fairfax, 
should compose one district, and the two large counties, 
Loudoun and Fauquier, the other, as in the districts for the 
election of State senators, and in this way the small county 
of Fairfax would not lose its voice in the election, as would 
be the case if it was associated with a single, much larger 
county. In the following year, 1792, the Assembly in 
December, two months after George Mason s death, passed 
an act forming nineteen Congressional districts instead of 
the twenty-one anticipated. And the principle George 
Mason contended for seems to have been in some measure 
regarded. One district was formed of the large county of 
Loudoun with the two small ones of Fairfax and Prince 
William, while another district comprised the large county 
of Fauquier and the two small counties of Culpepper and 
Stafford. 1 George Mason s paper, which was probably writ 
ten to be circulated among the freeholders of his county, 
and to be used by its representatives in the Assembly, is full 
of dignity, and is a clear and logical presentation of his 
subject, basing its argument on the fundamental principles 
of free government which its author had so often expounded 
on greater occasions. But though the matter was not one 
affecting a continent or a commonwealth, it involved a 
political right and was therefore of value to the true patriot 
and statesman, and makes a not unfitting close to his public

Colonel Mason s son John was still in Virginia, and some 
notes to him from his father written in December, 1791, 
bring to a conclusion the year s personal record for the

348 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

GUNSTON HALL, December 6, 1791. 
DEAR JOHN : 

Having occasion to send the bearer, negro Charles, to Dr. 
Craik, I take the opportunity by him, of informing you that I 
expect my overseers, Green and Tugate, or one of them will go 
to Alexandria to-morrow or next day, in my little boat. I will 
direct them to apply to you, and you can let me know by them 
whether you have sold my wheat, &c. I have also to desire you 
will buy for me in town, upon the best terms you can for cash, 
and send me down by the overseers, in my boat, the articles per 
list on the other side. It will be best to have them ready for the 
overseers before they come up, that the boat may not be detained, 
and I will repay you the money for them when you return to 
Gunston. I forgot to ask you whether you had taken out for me 
(as I desired) from the Alexandria inspectors, the notes for my 
little Hunting Creek crop, of which I gave you a memorandum. 
If you have not pray take them out now, and bring them to me 
when you come to Gunston. Notes have not been issued for any 
of the said crop, except one hogshead, for which I gave Mitchell, 
the overseer an order. 

Since you went away I have been reflecting upon the situation 
you are in with the ships you are now loading, and that if you 
don t get the tobacco speedily they may perhaps be stopped by 
the ice. Rather than you should incur this risk, I will ship you, 
on board of both, or either of your ships (besides the notes 
already delivered you), sixty-five hogsheads of tobacco, which 
I have by me, four of which are in Aquia, two at the Falls, and 
all the rest at Chickamuxon, Dumfries, Colchester, and Alexan 
dria. Lindsay at Colchester owes me five hogsheads which he 
has told me were ready whenever I called for them. If they are, 
and I will send to him to-day to know, you may have them also, 
as they may enable you to leave out the tobacco at Aquia or the 
Falls, as may best answer your purpose. If you find it necessary 
to take the tobacco I offer it will be proper to advise me of 
it without delay. . . . The reason I did not incline to ship 
this tobacco when I gave you the other notes, was that it is com 
mon, ordinary, light tobacco, and I was dubious of the quality 
answering the French market, now that the emulation among the 
individual manufacturers will occasion a demand for tobaccos of 



TOBACCO SHIPPED TO FRANCE. 349 

superior qualities, though considering the present low price and 
unpromising prospects here, I think I can hardly lose by shipping 
in French bottoms. 

I am, dear John, 

Your affectionate father, 

G. MASON. 



GUNSTON HALL, December 15, 1791. 

12 o clock. 
DEAR JOHN : 

Your brother George having occasion to send to Alexandria, I 
take the opportunity of writing by his messenger, and wish to hear 
whether most of your long expected craft has arrived, and whether 
you have secured tobacco enough for both of your ships, &c. 
Thinking you would be glad to hear how your craft in Occoquan 
is going on, I sent this morning to know. Mr. Bayley writes me 
that the craft which took in tobacco from Colchester warehouse 
for you, a few days ago, got out of Occoquan yesterday, and he 
imagines is at Alexandria before this time ; and that another 
craft of yours, I presume that which went to Chickamuxon for 
my tobacco there, is now at the wharf at Colchester taking in 23 
hhds. of my tobaccos and 5 hhds. shipped by Mr. Carter of 
" Nomini " and will go off this evening. The mercury is now at 
40 degrees in Fahrenheit s thermometer, 8 degrees above the 
freezing point. If this weather holds another day it will cer 
tainly open all the creeks. Indeed I expect the creek at Dum 
fries will be open this afternoon, so that if the shippers of the 
craft do their duty, all your tobaccos from these warehouses will 
be up this week. About Christmas, or two or three days before, 
the winter s frost may probably set in, before which time I hope 
you may be able to get your ships loaded and down the river. 
After you have made your arrangements, with respect to my 
tobacco and got it on board the ships, give me the earliest in 
formation you can, that I may have my letters, &c., ready. You 
know it is my custom to enclose exact lists of the marked numbers 
and weights [gross, tare, and nett] of my tobacco, with the bills of 
lading. 

Pray tell Mr. Wilson I am surprised at his not having sent a 
vessel for my wheat, being very anxious to have it taken away 



350 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

before the frost sets in ; and therefore desire the opportunity 
this fine weather affords may not be lost. 
I am, dear John, 

Your affectionate father, 

G. MASON. 

P. S. Please get me a good closet lock and send it by the 
bearer if from Mr. Hodgson s to be charged to my account, if 
from any other store you will please to pay the cash for it. 

John Mason, Esq : 
Alexandria. 

GUNSTON HALL, December 23, 1791. 
DEAR JOHN : 

Enclosed you have my letters for Bordeaux and Marseilles, 
which I hope will be in time for the ships. Indeed I fear last 
night s hard frost has blocked them up, though if to-day and to 
morrow turn out mild weather, the river will open again, as the 
ice is but thin yet. . . . And you will give the proper direc 
tions about your brother Thomas s watch, and about the four 
pieces of coarse grey blankets I have ordered from Bordeaux. 

The overseer gave me a little bit of small cordage you sent down 
to see if it would answer for leading lines. Leading lines should 
be a very small size larger, and twisted in a different manner, 
viz., what is called cable-laid ; they should also be made of the 
soundest, strongest hemp. ... I have ordered the bearer, 
Joe, to carry up a portmanteau, saddle and mail pillion, as you 
desired, and hope to see you at Gunston on Saturday. 
I am, dear John, 

Your affectionate father, 

G. MASON. 1 

This last letter, written two days before Christmas, shows 
us that John Mason was expected home for the holidays. 
And no doubt there was a happy family party assembled on 
this occasion. George Mason from " Lexington," with his 
wife and children, were near enough to drive over to 
" Gunston " at any time. William Mason was then living 
with his father, though he afterwards removed permanently 

1 Mason Papers. 



ACCOUNT OF COLONEL MASON S FAMILY. 351 

to " Mattawoman," the old Eilbeck place in Maryland. 
Thomson Mason s house, " Hollin Hall," on an estate in 
Fairfax, adjoining that of " Mount Vcrnon," was built for 
him by his father about this time. Thomas Mason lived in 
Alexandria in these years, though he settled later at "Wood- 
bridge," his estate in Prince William County. John Mason, 
after his final return from France, made his home on Mason s 
Island, near Georgetown, bequeathed him in his father s will, 
and there called Barbadoes. Mrs. McCarty was living at 
"Cedar Grove," in the neighborhood of "Gunston Hall." 
And of the three other sisters, two of them were located in 
adjoining counties not far distant. Mary, Mrs. Cooke, lived 
at " West Farm," in Stafford County, and Elizabeth, Mrs. 
Thornton, at " The Cottage," in King George County. Ann, 
the eldest daughter and her father s house-keeper during 
his widowhood, had been married now some years, and her 
home was at " Aquasco," in Prince George County, Mary 
land. These brothers and sisters were an affectionate and 
united family, and John Mason wrote of their early home- 
life together as a very harmonious and happy one. And 
he says : 

" I can add with truth as I do with infinite pleasure, and as a 
just tribute to the memories of my brothers and sisters, all of 
whom have now for some years departed this life, that the most 
sincere, constant affection and interchange of kindly offices sub 
sisted afterwards among us all. And that there never was, to the 
best of my knowledge, a single quarrel or even a transient cool 
ness that ever took place between any of us." : 

The affection between George Mason and his children was 
very close and tender, as the letters of the former to his two 
sons amply testify. As the daughters were all settled so 
near him, but little occasion arose for correspondence no 
doubt, as was the case also with the three sons who did not 
go abroad.

352 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

Early in January John Mason left " Gunston " again for a 
trip to Philadelphia and New York. His father was suffer 
ing at the time from an attack of the gout, as we learn from 
this letter to his son : 

GUNSTON HALL, January 23d, 1792. 
DEAR JOHN : 

I received your letter from Baltimore of the yth inst. and am 
glad to hear you were like to meet with no disappointment in re 
ceiving my money from Messrs. Smiths, and making the payment 
I desired to Mr. Dulany. I was in hopes he would readily have 
given up the interest during the war, as I believe every British 
creditor who has received his debt, without a suit, has done it ; 
and the Supreme Courts in this State, and I believe in most, if 
not all the others, have constantly deducted it. There was, I 
understand, an opinion given in the federal court in Connecticut 
(though I believe not a final one) that interest upon British debts 
was recoverable, which I suppose is what Mr. Dulany alluded to. 
I wish I had thought to have desired you, just to make the ex 
periment, whether he would not have given up the interest during 
the war, by telling him that upon those terms only, the money 
would be immediately paid. I am very anxious to hear the last 
news from France. I presume you got your letters by the ships, 
that had arrived at Baltimore from Bordeaux, the day after you 
wrote to me. 

I am also anxious to hear that you keep your health, being 
apprehensive that this extreme cold weather (which is probably 
still more severe to the Northward) will not agree with your con 
stitution. The snow is now as deep here as it was in the hard 
winter of 1740, indeed I think deeper than I ever saw it, except 
in the winter of 1773. It will occasion, I expect, great losses in 
the stocks of cattle in this part of the country, badly as it is 
provided with provender, from the short crops of corn and 
hay. 

I have just recovered from the fit of the gout you left me in, 
and am now able to walk about the house, though still a little 
lame. In every other respect, thank God, I am in good health. 
It has proved, however, a pretty severe fit, though a regular one 
and remained confined to one of my feet. 



THE POTOMAC RIVER BRIDGE. 353 

Present me to my friend Col. Monroe, and tell him I should 
have done myself the honor of answering his letters sooner, had 
not the gout forbid me, for it is not without pain that I am yet 
able to sit at a table and write. 

I have received a letter from Mr. Stoddert upon the subject 
of the projected bridge, in which he gives me at large the 
same reasons he did you to persuade me that its effects will be 
favorable to a town on my land on this side the river. I verily 
believe he is of that opinion himself, for I know him a man of 
great candor. I enclose you a copy of my answer to him, by 
which you will see I am willing to compromise with the gentle 
men, upon fair and reasonable terms, though I thought it best at 
present to leave the matter open, to see if they are inclined to 
offer me such. Besides that I wish to act liberally on the occa 
sion, I have some particular reasons for desiring to avoid any 
dispute with them, which I will communicate to you when I see 
you. The effects of the bridge as well as the practicability of 
the execution are very doubtful, and I am at some loss to esti 
mate what will be a just and reasonable compensation. I would 
not willingly ask more nor take less. What do you think of 
agreeing to take, forever, a certain part (say about a fifth) of 
the gross tolls or money received annually for passengers &c., 
without my having any concern in the building, repairs or 
expences of the bridge ? I wish you would endeavor to make 
yourself acquainted with, and inform me, of the tolls or rates 
taken at the bridge from Boston to Charles Town, and the 
annual amount of the money received. It is probable Mr. 
Gerry, or some of the Massachusetts gentlemen in Congress, 
can inform you. Or if you will write to Mr. Gorham he can 
give you the fullest information being, if I recollect right, one 
of the proprietors and managers. I should be glad also to 
know the length and breadth of the Boston bridge, the width 
of the spaces on each side for foot passengers, and the space 
in the middle for carriages. Pray let me hear from you as 
often as you conveniently can. Tell me how you have your 
health, whether you have determined to go any further east 
ward than New York, and when we may expect to see you 
again at Gunston. Your brother George and his family are 
well : he keeps his health this winter better than could have

been expected, for I dreaded the effect of this severe weather 
upon him. 

I am, dear John, 

Your affectionate father, 

G. MASON. 
per post 

Mr. John Mason, 

Philadelphia. 

If Mr. Mason should have left Philadelphia, recommended to 
the care of Mr. Joseph Anthony to forward to him. 1 

In May Colonel Mason wrote the following letter of 
business to John Francis Mercer : 

GUNSTON HALL, May i2th, 1792. 
DEAR SIR : 

I yesterday received a letter (forwarded by Mr. Johnson) from 
you, dated the 23rd October, 1791, covering an old letter from 
Mr. Rutland to you, respecting some land he said he had upon 
James river. Had this letter come to my hands in Rutland s life 
time it might have enabled me to have examined into the title, 
situation and value of the land, and perhaps, by it, to have 
secured part of my debt ; at present I do not know that it 
will be of any use to me. 

I wrote to you last fall, respecting two bonds from the late Mr. 
George Frazer Hawkins, to me which I had formerly put into 
your hands, and enclose you a memorandum of the dates and 
amounts of them ; but I have not been favored with any answer 
from you upon the subject, and Mr. Johnson tells me you do not 
recollect having had them. If I now had the bonds I could find 
means of obtaining the debt, and must entreat you to search for 
them. I remember, at the time I gave them to you (in my own 
house) seeing you put them into a pocket book you then had with 
you. They must certainly be somewhere among your papers, 
and if carefully searched for, I have no doubt may be found. 
In case you cannot find them, I have to request that you will 
advise me what manner I shall proceed to ascertain and recover 
the debts ; for the sum is too large for me to lose, if the loss can 

1 MS. Letter. 



L A IV S UI TS IN MA R YLA ND. 355 

be avoided. The said bonds are regularly entered and charged 
in my ledger. I can prove by Col. Lyles (who transacted the 
business with Mr. Hawkins for me) that he took two such bonds 
from Mr. Hawkins, on my behalf, though perhaps he may not 
recollect the precise dates, or respective amounts. These bonds 
were both put in suit in Prince George s county court against 
Mr. Hawkins, and the suits abated by his death ; and it appears 
from the records of that court, that the two actions of debt, 
George Mason vs. George Frazer Hawkins, respectively corre 
spond exactly with the bonds charged in my ledger ; that is, the 
said suits are exactly par double the sum (as the penalty) of each 
of the bonds charged in my ledger. Upon the abatement of the 
suits, on Mr. Hawkins s death, I withdrew the bonds from the 
clerk s office of Prince George s county, and after having kept 
them some time by me, gave them to you, that you might join my 
claim to those of some of the other creditors, who I understood 
had filed a bill in chancery, in order to subject Mr. Hawkins s 
lands to the payment of his bond-debts, during the minority of 
his devisees. Perhaps you may have lodged them in the chan 
cery office for this purpose. I have cause to believe there are, or 
soon will be assets in the hands of his executors, or rather in the 
hands of his administrators, de bonis non, I beg you will let me 
hear from you upon this subject, as soon as you have had time to 
make the proper inquiries. 

I am altogether unacquainted with the present state of my suit 
with Mr. David Ross. I have wrote to Mr. Luther Martin once 
or twice lately about it, but can get no answer from him, and 
have reason to believe it has been very much neglected by him. 
When I conversed with you about it last, you were of opinion 
that it would not be proper (Mr. Ross s father having obtained a 
patent for the land) to venture a trial at common law, upon the 
ejectment, until we had either obtained a patent from the land 
office, upon Mr. Bladen s certificate of survey, of many years 
older date than Mr. Ross s patent, survey, or warrant, assigned to 
me by Mr. Benjamin Tasker, Mr. Bladen s attorney in fact, a 
patent ordered to be issued thereon to me, and the patent to me 
actually drawn, but before the governor had affixed the seal, and 
stopped by a caveat from Mr. Ross s father, and the caveat never 
tried. Or else that we should by a bill in chancery, endeavor 



356 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

either to vacate Mr. Ross s patent, or compel him to convey to 
me so much thereof as is included in Mr. Bladen s certificate of 
survey for the tract called the " Pleasant Valley." The papers 
and statement in yours and Mr. Martin s hands, give all the in 
formation I am able to furnish, and I hope you will now be able 
to attend to it, for I am extremely anxious to have the matter 
fairly and speedily tried, upon its real merits, so that the title 
may be clearly and finally settled, and enable me, if settled in my 
favor, to sell the land, in order to close the Ohio Company s 
affairs as speedily as possible. 

I am, with great regard, dear Sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

G. MASON. 
John F. Mercer, Esq., 
Annapolis. 1 

Colonel Mason seems to have suffered some annoyances 
with his Maryland lawyers. First Mr. Thomas Stone, as he 
thinks, is a little careless of his Virginia client s interests, 
then Luther Martin, his Convention friend, proves forgetful 
and will not answer his letters, and lastly his relative, Mr. 
Mercer, cannot find some bonds that had been put in his 
hands while on a visit at " Gunston Hall." Doubtless 
George Mason, with his orderly habits and prompt methods, 
could not always make allowances for the busy advocates 
who were managing his affairs. Subsequent letters from 
George Mason of " Lexington," written after his father s 
death to John F. Mercer, show him winding up the Ohio 
Company s concerns as Colonel Mason s executor. The 
latter had left a statement in his own handwriting of the 
Ohio Company s funds. The dividend when collected 
would amount to 102 \2s. gd. James and John Francis 
Mercer, as members of the Company, were to receive their 
share. 

The last letters of George Mason that are known to be 
extant were written to his son John in May and August, 
1792: 

1 MS. Letter. 



LAST LETTERS TO HIS SON. 357 



GUNSTON HALL, May 22, 1792. 
DEAR JOHN : 

Your man Lewis arrived here this morning with letters from 
you and your brother Tom. 

I am glad to hear my tobacco on board the Auguste, Capt. Ca- 
bella, is insured, and thank you for the directions you have given 
Messrs. Cathalan s respecting it. I have never heard in what 
manner this vessel was lost, or whether her crew or any part of 
the cargo was saved ; nor have I yet heard anything of the French 
brig you loaded at Alexandria for Bordeaux, on board which I 
had fifty hogsheads of tobacco. As I understand some very good 
accounts of sales for good Virginia tobacco have lately been re 
ceived from London, I think it probable you may be able to resell, 
to advantage, the tobacco you have purchased if you should find 
it necessary. 

The prodigious fall of exchange between France and foreign 
countries, and the great and continuing depreciation of their 
assignats, are truly alarming circumstances, such as I very much 
fear will be productive of general dissatisfaction and confusion, 
and render it extremely difficult if not impracticable, to keep up 
an army and support an expensive war. This summer must, I 
presume, bring things to a crisis, and show the nation with 
certainty, what they are to expect from the great powers of 
Europe. Prussia, I have no doubt, would be ready enough to 
guaranty the Low Countries to the Emperor, but I think the Eng 
lish government will hardly hazard so unpopular a measure. 

As I shall forward this letter by the first post, I am in hopes it 
will find you in Norfolk, and shall therefore trouble you with the 
execution of a piece of business there, which though at first 
a trifle, is by the unexpected delay I have met with in it, now 
become an object of considerable importance to me. I wanted a 
few, a hundred feet of cypress scantling for the columns, rails, 
ballusters &c of the piazzas and steps to your brother Thomson s 
house. None of this scantling being large, it might, I dare say at 
any time have been procured in a fortnight, if attention had been 
paid to it. About this time twelvemonth or sooner, I wrote 
to Mr. John Brent and enclosed him an exact bill of this scant 
ling and at the same time a memorandum of a large quantity of 
shingles I wanted, and desiring to know if they could be got at 



358 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

Norfolk so as to be landed here in the course of last sum 
mer or fall. I limited the price of the shingles, but as the quan 
tity of cypress scantling was small I limited no price to that, but 
desired Mr. Brent to have it got as soon as he could, and sent up 
by the first vessel to Potomac river, to be landed about five 
or six miles below Alexandria, just at the upper end of General 
Washington s estate, and a very little below the large Pocorson, 
that runs from the mouth of Great Hunting Creek two or three 
miles down the river. Mr. Brent wrote me that the shingles 
could not be procured at the price I had limited, but that I 
might depend upon the scantling s being immediately got and 
sent up by the first vessel, at all events in the course of the sum 
mer (viz. : last summer). It not coming I have wrote repeatedly 
to Mr. Brent, twice this spring per post, but have had no answer. 
The captain of the packet from Alexandria to Norfolk was 
desired to speak to Mr. Brent about it. Mr. Brent told him 
the scantling was got, but had not been brought to Norfolk 
but that it should be at Norfolk, ready for the packet when she 
came down the next trip. The next trip the same excuse was 
made and the same promise repeated. In short I find Mr. Brent 
so careless and inattentive a man that no dependence or con 
fidence can be placed in him. When the packet was at Alexan 
dria some time ago your brother Thomson gave the captain a bill 
of this scantling, and desired the captain if when he went next to 
Norfolk Mr. Brent had not the scantling then ready for him to 
depend no longer upon him, but to have the scantling got and 
brought to Norfolk himself and bring it up with him. The 
packet went from Alexandria a few days ago, and is now, I sup 
pose, at Norfolk, where perhaps she may continue some time. I 
have lately got all the shingles, which with all the weather board 
ing are ready to put up. The house will be raised next week, and 
I am in danger of having the building stopped, and half a dozen 
workmen upon my hands, doing nothing, for want of this small 
quantity of cypress scantling, without which the piazzas can t be 
raised. What I have therefore to beg of you is to inquire imme 
diately of Mr. Brent and the captain of the packet, and if neither 
of them have already had the scantling got that you will endeavor 
to have it got with all possible expedition, and sent up by the 
packet now the"re, or if this can t be done, by the packet the next

trip, or by any other vessel which may happen to be coming 
to Alexandria soon. 

Your affectionate father, 

G. MASON. 

GUNSTON HALL, August 2oth, 1792. 
DEAR JOHN, 

About four or five years ago Mr. Henderson imported from 
Scotland, upon annual wages, two stonemasons, James Reid and 
Alexander Watson, very good workmen. Since the expiration of 
their contract with Mr. Henderson they have been working in 
Dumfries and about that part of the country, and last year made 
some free stone chimney-pieces for Col. Cooke which I think 
are well done and upon reasonable terms, to the best of my recol 
lection, a guinea each. Being desirous to get these men to make 
four free stone chimney-pieces for your brother Thomson s house, 
I sent down to Dumfries three or four days ago to get one of 
them to come up to take the dimensions of your brother Thom 
son s chimneys that they might immediately get the chimney- 
pieces, but was informed they are both at work at George Town, 
I suppose about the new bridge building over Rock Creek. I 
must therefore beg you will inquire them out, and see if you can 
get them to do your brother s chimney-pieces, as soon as the Rock 
Creek bridge is finished, which I am told will be by the last of 
this month, and that, in the meantime, the sooner the better, you 
will endeavor to get one of them to ride down to your brother 
Thomson s to take the dimensions of the four chimneys, for which 
he wants free stone chimney-pieces, and also of the fire place in 
his best room, and give directions for a marble chimney-piece to 
be sent for to England, unless one of those you have to dispose of 
will suit it, or can be made by them to do so, which you will know 
by getting the man to examine them after he returns from your 
brother s. If you can get one of these men to go down to your 
brother Thomson s you will be kind enough to let your man 
Lewis go down with him to show him the way, and you will hire 
a horse upon my account for the man to ride. I purpose that 
these men shall get the stone themselves for Thomson s chimney- 
pieces and hearth stones, either at Aquia or at the quarry near 
Dumfries, whichever they think the best stone, and I will carry 
them from thence to your brother Thomson s. 



360 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

This letter will be delivered you by our cousin, young George 
Mason of Pohick, by whom you will let me know whether you 
can get these men to do the chimney-pieces ; and also how com 
mon tobacco in George Town warehouse sells at present, and if 
likely to rise ? 

I see in a late Alexandria newspaper notice of an intended 
application to the Virginia Assembly at the next session for their 
projected bridge over Potomac River, opposite, or nearly opposite 
to George Town, and for a condemnation of land to join the 
Southern abutment to, and for a road, if necessary. You should 
take care to be fully prepared in time with a true plan and repre 
sentation of the situation of the place as connected both with 
George Town and the federal city, the comparative width of a bridge 
in each of the places (that proposed by them above and that to and 
from the Island) ; the true depth of water in both places should 
be ascertained, in which I would not have you trust to any repre 
sentation of theirs, and everything so done as to be authenticated 
by affidavits : the new bridge over the mouth of Rock Creek 
should also be laid down. And I think it would be of great im 
portance if by writing to Mr. L Enfant you could procure his 
opinion, with his reasons, in favor of a bridge at the Island, not 
letting the George Town people know that you make any such 
application. 

I am something better than when you left me ; my fevers have 
left me, but I am still very weak and low. 
I am, dear John, 

Your very affectionate father, 

G. MASON. 
John Mason, Esq : 

George Town, Maryland. 
By favor of Mr. George Mason, Junr., of Pohick. 

What were George Mason s sentiments regarding the gen 
eral government which he had seen inaugurated with so 
many misgivings ? We have caught a glimpse of them 
through Jefferson s letter of February, 1791, and from the 
same source, in connection with a significant phrase in one 
of Washington s letters, George Mason s views may be very 

1 Mason Papers. 



GEORGE MASON S POLITICAL SENTIMENTS. 361 

clearly determined. Jefferson wrote to Washington on the 
23d of May, 1792, urging him to come forward for a second 
presidential term, and giving him a remarkably candid 
review of the objections that had been made to the admin 
istration of the government. These objections Washington 
repeats in a confidential letter to Alexander Hamilton, 
classifying them under twenty-one several specifications. 1 
Washington writes Hamilton on the 2Qth of July, from 
" Mount Vcrnon," and says that on his way home and since 
his arrival he had sought to learn " the sentiments which 
are entertained of public measures." He finds that even 
the moderate men, friends of the government, are alarmed 
"at that system of policy and those interpretations," and he 
adds : " Others less friendly, perhaps, to the government, 
and more disposed to arraign the conduct of its officers 
(among whom may be classed my neighbor and quondam 
friend Col. M.), go further, and enumerate a variety of 
matters, which, as well as I recollect, may be adduced under 
the following heads." The " variety of matters " as given 
by Washington, in Jefferson s words, are evidently to be 
traced through the latter to George Mason. This is the last 
time that Washington mentions his old friend, in his corre 
spondence, and it does not seem likely there was much 
intercourse just then between " Gunston Hall " and " Mount 
Vernon." There is nothing, however, in George Mason s 
letters to show any diminution of the friendship between 
himself and Washington, though it is evident from what he 
writes to his son in March, 1789, that he feared some such 
alienation would arise. The objections, then, of George 
Mason, Jefferson, and others, to the measures of the federal 
government, related in the first place to the financial system 
introduced by the Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander 
Hamilton. In carrying out those schemes, affecting the 
public debt, the impost, the excise, " paper speculation," 
etc., wrote Jefferson, " a corrupt squadron, deciding the

voice of the legislature have manifested their dispositions to 
get rid of the limitations imposed by the constitution of the 
general legislature, limitations on the faith of which the 
States acceded to that instrument." The only hope of 
safety from the designs of these monarchists is in the 
" numerous representation which is to come forward the 
ensuing year" (1793). Jefferson in his letter concludes: 
" I can scarcely contemplate a more incalculable evil than 
the breaking of the Union into two or more parts," etc. 
Washington, giving the plural pronoun, to include George 
Mason and others, writes : 

" They declare they can contemplate no evil more incalculable, 
than the breaking of the Union into two or more parts ; yet when 
they view the mass, which opposed the original coalescence, they 
consider that it lay chiefly in the Southern quarter, and that the 
legislature have availed themselves of no occasion of allaying it, 
but, on the contrary, whenever Northern and Southern prejudices 
have come into conflict, the latter has been sacrificed and the 
former soothed. . . . That the Antifederal champions are 
now strengthened in argument by the fulfilment of their pre 
dictions, which have been brought about by monarchical Federal 
ists themselves. . . . They have themselves adopted the very 
constructions of the Constitution, of which, when advocating the 
acceptance before the tribunal of the people, they declared it 
unsusceptible ; whilst the republican Federalists, who espoused 
the same government for its intrinsic merits, are disarmed of their 
weapons, that which they denied as prophecy being now become 
true history. Who, therefore, can be sure, they ask that these 
things may not proselyte the small number, which was wanting 
to place the majority on the other side ? And this, they add, is 
the event at which they tremble." l 

Thomas Jefferson, so soon to become the leader of a 
triumphant Republican (or Democratic) party, which was to 
carry out in the government, as far as possible, the States- 
rights views of George Mason, turned with the affection and

LAST WORDS TO JEFFERSOX. 363 

reverence of a disciple to the retired sage of " Gunston 
Hall." It is evident that he had much correspondence with 
him, and was eager to know his views on all public matters. 
And in the spirit of Elias to the departing Elijah, the 
younger statesmen visited and consulted with George Mason, 
in the last weeks of the latter s life, gathering from his own 
lips the final expression of a mind still as vigorous as ever 
and imbued to the end with the patriot s devotion to free 
dom. The mantle of the prophet was to fall on the shoulders 
of one who, in his turn, and on a wider theatre, was to 
preach the creed of that political gospel on which depends 
the conservation of community independence and of personal 
liberty. Jefferson left " Monticello " on the 22d of Septem 
ber, on his way to Philadelphia, where Congress was to meet 
early in November. He stopped, on his way, both at 
" Mount Vernon" and "Gunston Hall." His conferences 
at the latter place, as recorded in the Anas, are prefaced 
with these words: "Gunston Hall, September 3Oth, 1792, 
ex-rclatione George Mason." It was thus on the last day of 
September, just a week before George Mason s death, that 
this conversation was held. Jefferson reports the talk of 
his host on the subject of the Federal Convention and its 
work : 

" The constitution as agreed to till a fortnight before the Con 
vention rose, was such a one as he would have set his hand and 
heart to. i. The president was to be elected for seven years, then 
ineligible for seven years more. 2. Rotation in the Senate. 3. 
A vote of two-thirds on particular subjects, and expressly on that 
of navigation^ The three New England States were constantly 
with us in all questions, Rhode Island not there, and New York 
seldom ; so that it was these three States, with the five Southern 
States, against Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. With 
respect to the importation of slaves, it was left to Congress. This 
disturbed the two Southernmost States, who knew that Congress 
would immediately suppress the importation of slaves. Those 
two States, therefore, struck up a bargain with the three New 
England States, that if they would join to admit slaves for some 



364 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

years, the two Southernmost States would join in changing the 
clause which required two-thirds of the legislature in any vote. 
It was done. The articles were changed accordingly, and from 
that moment the two Southernmost States and the three Northern 
ones joined Pennsylvania, Jersey and Delaware, and made the 
majority of eight to three against us, instead of eight to three for 
us, as it had been through the whole Convention. Under this 
coalition, the great principles of the Constitution were changed 
in the last days of the Convention. The Constitution as agreed 
to at first was, that amendments might be proposed either by 
Congress or the legislatures. A committee were appointed to 
digest and redraw. Gouverneur Morris and King were of the 
committee. One morning Gouverneur Morris moved an instru 
ment for certain alterations (not one-half the members yet come 
in). In a hurry and without understanding, it was agreed to. 
The committee reported so that Congress should have the exclu 
sive power of proposing amendments. George Mason observed 
it on the report and opposed it. King denied the construction. 
Mason demonstrated it, and asked the committee by what 
authority they had varied what had been agreed. G. Morris 
then imprudently got up and said by authority of the Convention, 
and produced the blind instruction before mentioned, which was 
unknown by one-half of the House, and not till then understood 
by the other. They then restored it as it originally stood." 

As to the existing administration and its course : 

" He [Mason] said he considered Hamilton as having done us 
more injury than Great Britain and all her fleets and armies. That 
his [Mason s] plan of settling our debt would have been something 
in this way. He would have laid as much tax as could be paid 
without oppressing the people ; particularly he would have laid 
an impost of about the amount first laid by Congress, but some 
what different in several of its articles. He would have suspended 
all application of it one year, during which an office should have 
been open to register unalienated certificates. At the end of the 
year he would have appropriated his revenue, ist, To pay the 
civil list ; 2nd, The interest of these certificates ; 3rd, Instal 
ments of the principal ; 4th, A surplus to buy up the alienated 
certificates, still avoiding to make any other provision for these

last. By the time the unalienated certificates should have been 
all paid, he supposed half the alienated ones would have been 
bought up at market. He would then have proceeded to redeem 
the residue of them." 

These notes of George Mason s conversation by Thomas 
Jefferson are the last words of his that have come down 
to us. 

George Mason died at " Gunston Hall " in the sixty-sev 
enth year of his age, on the afternoon of Sunday, the /th of 
October, 1792, and was buried by the side of his wife in the 
family graveyard on the estate. 2 He had evidently been 
suffering for some time from his old enemy the gout most 
probably as he speaks in his letter to his son, the 2Oth of 
August, of his " fevers " having left him, but that he is still 
" very weak and low." On the 3Oth of September, however, 
he was able to see Jefferson, and to converse with him freely 
on matters of public importance. There was probably some 
obituary notice of Colonel Mason in the Virginia Gazette 
but no complete file of the paper for this year can be found. 
In the Maryland Journal, published in Baltimore, there is 
the following announcement of George Mason s death, 
though the date assigned is incorrect. " On the I4th 
ult. died, at Gunston Hall in Fairfax County, Virginia, 
the Hon. George Mason, Esquire. In addition to his emi 
nent talents as a statesman, he was a gentleman of great 
Virtues and Patriotism." The Gentleman s Magazine for 
January, 1793, contained also a notice of the death of this 
distinguished American patriot, and the date is there rightly 
given as October 7th : " At his domain of Gunston Hall, in 
Fairfax County, Virginia, in the 67th year of his age, Col.

George Mason." Then follows the extract from his will 
recommending a private station to his sons, but charging them 
to defend and cherish the liberties of their country. 1 There 
remains no account of George Mason s funeral, and unfortu 
nately neither Washington nor Jefferson could have been 
present, as they had repaired to the seat of government in 
Philadelphia before his death occurred, Jefferson arriving 
there on the 5th. On the 1st of October he was with Wash 
ington at " Mount Vernon." At Washington s funeral some 
years later, a son of George Mason was one of the intimate 
circle of friends invited to attend the ceremonies. No stone, 
unhappily, marks the grave of George Mason. The five sons, 
who all survived him, doubtless proposed to pay this filial 
tribute to a parent so revered and beloved. But they left the 
purpose unaccomplished. One of the grandsons, in his 
generation, contemplated the erection of a suitable memorial 
to his great ancestor. But only the plan and inscription 
remain to testify to the pious design. In a letter to 
his cousin, Hon. James Murray Mason, George Mason of 
" Hollin Hall " and " Spring Bank " enclosed the projected 
design. 

Simplicity has always appeared to me to be the true and fitting 
type of sepulchre, especially for those great men whose names are 
their highest eulogium, whose deeds are their proudest monu 
ment. I send the following as the most appropriate tomb for our 
immortal ancestor, and would feel much gratified to have your 
opinion on it :

feet elevation, perpendicular. In each square of the foundation

Constitution of Virginia. On another side these words : Vitam

The shadow of the Civil War soon after darkened the land, 
and the grandsons of George Mason emerged from its gloom, 
to die, old men, not many years later, their fortunes ruined 
by the downfall of the Confederacy. 

George Mason s will, dated nineteen years before his death, 
left his family well provided for. 2 Though his expectations 
from the Ohio Company s lands were not destined to be re 
alized, he made later other purchases and investments, which 
proved profitable, and he was esteemed at all times a man 
of wealth, as wealth was estimated in those days. One of 
George Mason s descendants, (the same gentleman who pro 
jected the monument to him) thus sums up the condition of 
his ancestor s worldly affairs at the time of his death, and 
pays a just tribute to his practical wisdom in the care of his 
estates : 

" While the capacity of Col. Mason, as a statesman and a 
writer and a speaker has been so often the subject of merited 
laudation, it is indeed surprising that his still more admirable tal 
ents for acquisition and economy have been entirely overlooked, 
not only by those who have sketched his character for the public, 
but even by his descendants who profited so largely through their

deserved such praise, should it be denied to Liberty s purest and boldest votary ?

exertion, There were few men in America in his time, who 
evinced greater capacity for attaining honorable wealth, or exhib 
ited a more eminent example of that only source of its mainte 
nance, judicious economy. He undoubtedly inherited a large 
patrimonial estate, but that was not only greatly augmented 
during his life, but the foundation was laid for almost princely 
wealth for his descendants. He devised to his sons alone, some 
fifteen thousand acres, the greater part of his own acquisition, of 
the very best land in the Potomac region. Most of these estates 
were well improved, with large and comfortable mansions and all 
necessary outbuildings. But he left to be divided among his 
children what was solely acquired by himself ; sixty thousand 
acres of among the finest lands in Kentucky, some three hundred 
slaves, more than fifty thousand dollars worth of other personal 
property, and at least thirty thousand dollars of debts, due on his 
books, while his own indebtedness was absolutely nothing ; 
showing that his enterprise and economy in private fully equalled 
his genius and ability in public life, proving that fine talents, a 
highly cultivated mind, and long, laborious and eminent public 
services are not incompatible with that abnormis sapiens crasque 
Minerva, so indispensable to the every-day business of life. A 
most noble example, ever worthy the admiration, reverence and 
imitation of his latest posterity." 

Colonel Mason s library, which was divided between his 
five sons, as his will provided, was extensive and well 
selected. The present writer, however, has been unable to 
trace any of these books. Some of them, it is known, were 
literally scattered to the winds, as the leaves were torn from 
them and thrown into the camp-fires of Federal soldiers, 
when the country-seat in Loudoun County, where they were 
to be found, was occupied by the enemy in i862. 2 The de 
struction by fire, at an early period of the house on the 
estate of one of George Mason s sons, and within recent 

o 

years a repetition of the same casuality in the case of one of

HIS LIBRARY AND ITS DISPERSION. 369 

his grandsons, will account for the loss of many of these 
books, as well as of valuable family papers. That in this 
library were many Greek and Latin classics, among which 
were well-used copies of Catullus and Ovid, a letter of 
George Mason of "Spring Bank" to John Esten Cooke 
attests. The editor of the " Spotswood Letters " notices the 
libraries, really extensive for the time, of the second William 
Byrd of " Westover," of Sir John Randolph of Williamsburg, 
and of John Mercer of " Marlboro ," and numerous others 
nearly as large, " among them that of George Mason of 
Gunston." We may assume from allusions and quotations 
in George Mason s letters and speeches, that among his 
books were to be found Virgil and Tacitus, Shakespeare and 
Dry den and Pope ; English historians, political writers and 
pamphleteers ; the French oracle on government, Montes 
quieu ; the Italian sage Macchiavelli ; and the English Whig 
writer, George Mason s contemporary, whom he so much ad 
mired, the brilliant and caustic " Junius." With the aid of the 
astronomer s manuscripts, published works, and correspon 
dence, and an inventory returned by his immediate descend 
ants, scholars have been able to reconstruct the library of 
Galileo, arranging and classifying five hundred and twenty- 
one volumes. Unfortunately little material remains for the 
accomplishment of the same pious task in the case of any of 
our eighteenth-century Virginians. 

In making an estimate of George Mason s character and 
abilities, we can but retouch the picture as portrayed by the 
more intelligent and sympathetic of his contemporaries. One 
of a famous group of historic figures, the friend and asso 
ciate of Washington, Richard Henry Lee, Jefferson, Madi 
son, Patrick Henry, they have all helped us, directly or 
indirectly, to see him as he lived and walked among them. 
Though we obtain no sketch of George Mason from the lips 
of Washington and Lee, we are not left in doubt as to their 
high regard for him. Washington s free and intimate cor-

370 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

respondence, carried on through the greater part of a life 
time, attests his estimation of the sterling traits of character, 
and the eminent talents of his friend. And this impression 
is scarcely impaired at the last by the few slighting words 
Washington suffered himself to write of Mason when his 
early ally and familiar companion had become his deter 
mined political opponent. Richard Henry Lee seems to 
have had George Mason s entire confidence all through his 
career, and we cannot fail to perceive how thorough was 
Lee s appreciation of Mason, with whom he was in complete 
sympathy apparently on all the great issues of the eventful 
years in which they labored together, first for independence 
of Great Britain, and secondly for the preservation of the 
independence of the State against federal aggression. Jeffer 
son, from first to last, looked upon George Mason as one of 
the wisest of Virginians, or indeed of his contemporaries, on 
the theatre of the American Revolution. In his correspond 
ence with Mason, in his " Autobiography," in his "Anas," 
this is fully demonstrated. Jefferson s character of Mason, as 
sketched in the former s " Autobiography," has been given in 
an earlier chapter, and need not be repeated here. These 
two statesmen, George Mason and Thomas Jefferson, bore 
the relation, more fully perhaps than Jefferson himself per 
ceived, of master and disciple in the school of States-rights, 
though Jefferson, like Madison, did not at first see with the 
elder sage s clear vision. 

Madison, in the stress and conflict of 1787-88, was not 
prepared to do his great opponent justice. Both Washing 
ton and Madison, as Grigsby says, " in the heat of the mo 
ment wrote about Henry and Mason the Gamaliels at 
whose feet he [Washington] sat for twenty years in a 
manner that betrayed more passion than judgment." And 
he adds : " Great as were the merits of Washington and 
Madison, and none rejoices in them more than I do, it is 
simply stating an historical fact in saying that in 1788 neither 
of them stood in the estimation of the Virginia of that day 
on the same platform with Patrick Henry and George Mason 



TRIBUTES OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES. 371 

as a statesman." Madison s calmer judgment gave after 
wards another verdict ; and he came not many years later to 
be considered as an expounder of the States-rights doctrines 
of which Mason was the early and consistent apostle. St. 
George Tucker, who knew personally many of George 
Mason s contemporaries, who had heard Richard Henry 
Lee speak in public and thought him the " most mellifluous 
orator " he had ever listened to, who had received the tradi 
tion of Thomson Mason that he was " esteemed the first 
lawyer at the bar," reports from Madison s own lips his 
estimate of Thomson Mason s great brother. Among such 
orators as Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee, in a 
galaxy that contained such a speaker as Innes, of whom 
Tucker says that he " may be compared to an eagle in the 
air ; you looked up at him with admiration and delight," 
George Mason, Madison thought, was in a sense pre-emi 
nent : " He possessed the greatest talents for debate of any 
man he [Madison] had ever seen or heard speak." : Madi 
son, in his old age, in a letter quoted in a previous chapter, 
written to one of George Mason s grandsons, gives some 
account of the former as a public man, and adds interesting 
testimony to his genial, social qualities. He says to his 
correspondent : 

" The biographical tribute you meditate is justly due to the 
merits of your ancestor, Colonel George Mason. It is to be re 
gretted that, highly distinguished as he was, the memorials of him 
on record, or perhaps otherwise attainable, are more scanty than 
many of his contemporaries far inferior to him in intellectual 
powers and public services. It would afford me much pleasure 
to be a tributary to your undertaking [a biography of Mason]. 
But although I had the advantage of being on the list of his per 
sonal friends, and in several instances of being associated with 
him in public life, I can add little for the pages of your work. 
The public situation in which I had the best opportunity 
of being acquainted with the genius, the opinions and the public

372 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

labors of your grandfather, was that of our co-service in the Con 
vention of 1 787, which framed the Constitution of the United States. 
The objections which led him to withhold his name from it have 
been explained by himself. But none who differed from him on 
some points will deny that he sustained throughout the pro 
ceedings of the body, the high character of a powerful reasoner, 
a profound statesman, and a devoted republican. 

" My private intercourse with him was chiefly on occasional 
visits to * Gunston when journeying to and from the North, in 
which his conversations were always a feast to me. But though 
in a high degree such, my recollection, after so long an interval, 
cannot particularize them in a form adapted to biographical 
use. I hope others of his friends still living, who enjoyed more 
of his society, will be able to do more justice to the fund of in 
structive observations and interesting anecdotes for which he 
was celebrated." 

Family tradition confirms this report of George Mason s 
conversational powers. But alas ! no Boswell has preserved 
for posterity the crumbs of these intellectual feasts. The 
" fund of instructive observations," the " interesting anec 
dotes," have passed into oblivion. Only one story has 
floated down to us on the stream of time, illustrating 
George Mason s quick and caustic wit. John Randolph of 
Roanoke, who greatly admired Mason, alludes to it, though 
he gives it an odd turn, when he says : " My judgment, I 
believe, has not deserted me, and when it does, as old George 
Mason said, I shall be the last person in the world to find it 
out." : John Esten Cooke narrates the anecdote in a sketch 
of George Mason, written in 1859, ^ or one f the New York 
papers, and he repeats it in a later article. 3 In a private 
letter to the present writer the story is worded as follows : 

" The evidence of George Mason s humor, though it would 
probably be more appropriate to call it wit, I thought I could

see in his bon mot when a candidate for the legislature. His 
opponent declared that the people of Stafford [Fairfax ?] knew 
that Colonel Mason s mind was failing, to which he replied, that 
when his adversary s mind failed nobody would ever discover 
it, which I think was as biting as anything ever uttered by 
Talleyrand." l 

This retort of George Mason s recalls the anecdote related 
of Sir John Maynard, the eminent lawyer and king s ser- 
jeant, who, when eighty-six years old, having been sixty years 
at the bar, was told by Jeffreys that he had got so old he 
forgot the law. " T is true, Sir George," replied Maynard, 
" I have forgot more law than you ever knew." 

George Mason s high estimation of Patrick Henry, as he 
saw him first in the early years of the Revolution, he has given 
us through a letter to Martin Cockburn. What Patrick Henry 
thought of George Mason has been happily preserved for 
posterity in a paragraph of one of Virginia s chronicles: 
" When Patrick Henry was a member of the Continental 
Congress he said the first men in that body were Washing 
ton, Richard Henry Lee, and Roger Sherman ; and later in 
life [he declared] Roger Sherman and George Mason [were] 
the greatest statesmen he ever knew." 2 The sketch of 
George Mason s character, as given by Edmund Randolph 
in his manuscript history of Virginia, has been quoted in a 
former chapter. It is found in connection with the pen 
portraits of Patrick Henry, of Thomas Jefferson, of Peyton 
Randolph, of Richard Henry Lee, of Robert Carter Nicho 
las, Edmund Pendleton, George Washington, Richard Bland, 
Benjamin Harrison, George Wythe, John Blair, and Thomas 
Ludwell Lee. These were the Virginia leaders in 1774. 
A little later Madison is added to the group. This valuable 
work of Edmund Randolph s was never completed, and but 
a fragment of it, discovered in Staunton, in 1860, remains. 
Randolph, it seems, contemplated writing for it, and did 
actually prepare " parallels between the characters of certain

men, such, for instance, as those between General Washing 
ton and Mr. Jefferson, President Madison and General Ham 
ilton, George Mason and JoJm Dickerson, Benjamin Franklin 
and John Jay, Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee." 
John Dickerson, the author of the famous " Farmer s Let 
ters " of 1767, and of able public papers in the Congress of 
1774 and of 1775, was yet behindhand in patriotic sentiment 
in 1776, when he opposed the Declaration of Independence. 
An undoubted patriot, he was an extremely cautious one, 
and though his pen had prepared the way for revolution, his 
step faltered on the threshold of the new era. Learned, 
sensitive, pious, benevolent, pure-minded, and eminent, both 
as a writer and an orator, one sees in him certain points of 
resemblance to George Mason ; though broadly outlined 
there is apparent a wide contrast in the man John Adams, 
described in 1774 as " very modest, delicate, timid," and the 
virile, masterful spirit of the Virginian. And as Federalist 
and Antifederalist in 1787-88, the opinions of the two were 
distinctly at variance. John Dickerson, in his letters of 
" Fabius," supported the Constitution, while George Mason 
was working in the cause of amendments to the instrument 
they had jointly had a share in framing. Yet Dickerson, 
like Madison, saw later the error of his ways. 

Leaving George Mason s contemporaries for a succeeding 
generation, we find Henry Lee, the son of " Light-Horse 
Harry," Mason s martial antagonist in the Virginia Conven 
tion of 1788, repeating, doubtless, the sentiment he had 
heard from boyhood, when he wrote : " Among the many 
profound statesmen Virginia has produced, he [George 
Mason] was perhaps second to none in wisdom and virtue, 
and by many of the most renowned of his contemporaries 
was regarded as the wisest of them all." At length his

State determined to mark her sense of his distinguished ser 
vices. And in the oration delivered by the Hon. R. M. T.

to Mason and others who were to surround

" But Virginia here raises monuments to more than one of her 
children, and as she bends over that group of her departed sons, 
she may well shed the mingled tears of pride and grief. Among 
these she will place Lewis, her bold pioneer, who wrestled with 
the red man from the waters of the Holston to those of the Great 
Kanawa, and finally made good the title of her State to the pos 
session of the western wilderness on the bloody field of Point 
Pleasant, from which he drove the Indian beyond the Ohio.

whose generous sacrifices and great public services called forth 
the thanks of Washington at the siege of York. George Mason, 
too, is to be placed there in the fondness of a mother s pride, he 
whom history will proclaim one of the apostles of civil liberty, 
the author of the Bill of Rights of Virginia, the orator and the 
sage, whose vision was so nearly prophetic, and whose wisdom 
and patriotism made him a great leader in his day." 

Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson were also described 
in glowing terms, as among those to whom statues were 
decreed. But before Virginia could carry out the suggestion 
of her orator of 1858 and fill up her Revolutionary Pantheon 
with the figures of George Rogers Clark and others, the 
battle-fields of her second struggle for independence glorified 
her history, while desolating her soil, and since then her later 
heroes have rather thrust aside the earlier ones. But in 
collecting these tributes to George Mason, we come to two 
Virginia writers who saw, suffered in, and survived the 
"Confederate Revolution." John Esten Cooke wrote of 
George Mason in 1859: 

" There was living in Virginia, at the outbreak of the Revolu 
tion, in an old mansion called Gunston Hall, situated on the right 



3/6 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

bank of the Potomac, not far from Mount Vernon, one of the 
most remarkable men, not only of his country and of his epoch, 
but of all countries and all time. This man, who was not yet fifty 
years old, had never yet held any public office, but the first states 
men of his time consulted him and looked to him for guidance. 
He was not a lawyer, but his opinions on government had all the 
force and dignity of legislative decrees. He was not an agreeable 
speaker [?] yet when he rose to address an assembly the greatest 
orators Lee, Pendleton, Henry, and their co-mates listened to 
him with avidity. Confined almost wholly to his plantation by 
gout, or love of retirement, he nevertheless swayed and moulded 
public opinion. In the most urgent crises of public affairs the 
great actors looked, as it were, from the rostrum to the silent 
figure behind the scenes. . . . His ancestors had all been 
honorable and public-spirited ; they had lived and died as worthy 
old planters, fighting bravely against the Indians, or figuring in 
the House of Burgesses. They cultivated their acres, and kept up 
the old style of living in all its profusion mingling socially with 
the class which then ruled as titled persons rule at present in Eng 
land. Thus, George Mason of Gunston Hall, at the time of the 
Revolution, possessed by birth a position which entitled him to 
consideration. But this would never have made him what he was 
not a tithe of the force which he undoubtedly stood for in his 
time. It was the man himself, stripped of all adventitious aids, 
who asserted and maintained the vast intellectual dominion which 
he certainly wielded over the minds of the first thinkers of that 
age." 

There are frequent allusions to this " remarkable man," as 
he calls him, in John Esten Cooke s later sketches and 
delineations of Virginia history ; his last article which touches 
upon George Mason having been written in 1884, twenty-five 
years after the first strain sung in Mason s praise. General 
Richard Taylor writing of George Mason, in 1879, savs : 

" Among the wise and good who in the past century secured the 
independence of our country and founded its government, George 
Mason of Virginia holds a place second to none." 

1 New York Century, 1859. 



APPRECIA TION OF HIS GENIUS. 377 

And he adds : 

" On the soil of Virginia rests the tomb of George Mason, 
within sound of the Capitol of the Union which he labored to 
establish, while pointing out and in vain endeavoring to strengthen 
the weak places in its foundation. A Virginian to the core, his 
sympathies extended to the uttermost limits of the colonies, and 
were as deeply stirred by the sufferings of Massachusetts as were 
those of her own great patriots, the Adamses, Warren, Hancock. 
Mayhap there lurks some germ of truth in the weird superstition 
that disembodied spirits keep watch and ward over the resting- 
places of their mortal remains. What changes has the spirit of 
Mason witnessed since his body was returned to earth ! As the 
mighty prophets of Israel, mournfully has he watched the fulfil 
ment of his own predictions. He strove for a Union of consent 
and love. He has seen one of force and hate. He urged indepen 
dent States to create a common servant, the Federal Government, 
as a useful agent. He has seen the creature they called into being 
rend, like Frankenstein, its creators, disperse their assemblies at 
the point of the bayonet, deprive their citizens of every legal right. 
. . . With a sadness surpassing that of Rachel, he has seen 
the wealth and cultivation of the South destroyed by unlettered 
multitudes from the interior of the continent, directed by the 
fanaticism of the East." l 

Happily if George Mason s immortal spirit has seen the 
woes of Virginia and her sister Commonwealths of the Con 
federacy, it rejoices now in 1891, in their restored prosperity ; 
when the " New South," affectionately reverent of her recent 
not less than of her far off past, presses forward in a race for 
the prizes of the future. 

In conclusion, to the award of his contemporaries and 
personal friends, to the discriminating eulogies of George 
Mason s genius found in the utterances of Virginians and 
Southern men of later times, may be added the impartial, 
well-considered judgments of a number of Northern writers, 

1 The North American Review, February, 1879, "A Statesman of the 
Colonial Era." 



3/8 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

two or three of whom are quoted in former chapters. In the 
last category is found the late venerable historian Bancroft. 
In several paragraphs, where Virginia has been his theme, he 
has written in felicitous phrase of her patriot and statesman, 
George Mason. After noting his talents in debate and 
oratory, Bancroft adds : 

" But his great strength lay in his sincerity, which made him 
wise and bold, modest and unchanging, while it overawed his 
hearers. He was severe, but his severity was humane, with no 
tinge of bitterness, though he had a scorn for everything mean, 
and cowardly, and low ; and he always spoke out his convictions 
with frank directness. He had been truly loyal ; on renouncing 
his King, he could stand justified to his own conscience only by 
the purest and most unselfish attachment to human freedom." 1 

And as General Taylor writes in the article above quoted : 

" To be appreciated by the political student, who desires to 
understand the principles of free government and the formative 
history of the Federal Constitution, his work must be sought in 
the Declaration of Rights, Constitution and revised Code of Vir 
ginia, and in the debates of the Federal and Virginia Conventions, 
as must his affectionate nature in such letters to his children and 
friends as have been preserved ; and it may be safely asserted 
that no one can carefully exhaust these sources without doubting 
whether his own or any age has produced a man superior to 
George Mason in all the elements of greatness."

LETTERS RELATING TO THE COMPACT WITH MARYLAND. 
;J T _. MOUNT VERNON, March 28, 1785. 

olK. . 

We have the honor to transmit to the General Assembly, the 
result of the deliberations of the Commissioners of Virginia and 
Maryland, appointed to settle the navigation and jurisdiction of 
that part of the Chesapeake Bay within the limits of Virginia, and 
of the rivers Potomac and Pokomoke. 

We flatter ourselves that, in the execution of this important 
trust, the commissioners have consulted the true interest of both 
governments, in a compact of such just and mutual principles, 
that, executed with good faith, will perpetuate harmony, friend 
ship, and good offices between the two States, so essential to the 
prosperity and happiness of their people. In the conference on 
the subject of our appointment, several matters occurred to the 
commissioners, which they conceived very important to the com 
merce of the two States ; and which, with all deference, we take 
the liberty to communicate. 

The commissioners were of opinion, these States ought to have 
leave from the United States in Congress assembled, to form a 
compact for the purpose of affording in due time, and in just 
proportions between the two States, naval protection to such part of 
Chesapeake Bay and Potomac river which may at any time hereafter 
be left unprovided for by Congress. The commissioners did not 
consider themselves authorized to make any compact on this sub 
ject, and submit the propriety of the two governments making a 
joint application to Congress, for their consent to enter into com- 

379 



380 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

pact, for the purpose aforesaid ; such compact when made to be 
laid before Congress for their approbation ; and to continue until 
mutually dissolved by these States, or Congress shall declare that 
such compact shall no longer exist. 

It also appeared to the commissioners that foreign gold and 
silver coin, received in the two States, as the current money 
thereof, should pass at the same value, according to its fineness 
and weight ; and if the species of coin could be regulated at the 
same nominal value, it would be of great convenience to the com 
merce and dealings between the citizens of the two States. The 
damages on foreign bills of exchange protested are very different 
in the two States, and it is obvious that they ought to be the 
same, and should be considered in all cases, and to all purposes, 
as of equal rank with debts upon contract in writing, signed by 
the party, and it was suggested that fifteen pet. should be allowed, 
without regard to the time of negotiation, and legal interest on the 
principal from the time of protest. It was also conceived by the 
commissioners, that drafts by the merchants of either State, upon 
those of the other, in the nature of inland bills of exchange, 
should be subject by law, to official protest, by a notary public, 
and that the damages, for non-payment, should be the same in 
both States ; and it was thought, that eight pet. should be 
allowed upon protest, and legal interest upon the principal, from 
the time of protest. 

It appeared to the commissioners to be essential to the com 
merce and revenue of the two governments, that duties on imports 
or exports (if laid) should be the same in both States. 

If these subjects should be deemed worthy notice, it may be 
proper for the two legislatures, at their annual meeting in the 
autumn to appoint commissioners to meet and communicate the 
regulations of commerce and duties proposed by each State, and 
to confer on such subjects as may concern the commercial inter 
ests of both States. It was suggested that the number of the said 
commissioners should be equal, and not less than three, nor more 
than five, from each State ; and that they should annually meet in 
the third week in September, at such place as they should appoint. 

We have the honor to be with the greatest respect sir, 
Your most obedient servants

P. S. The Commissioners also beg leave to transmit to the 
General Assembly, the inclosed copy of their joint application to 
the State of Pennsylvania respecting the communication between 
Potomac River and the Western waters. 

Honorable the Speaker of the House 
of Delegates of Virginia. 

VIRGINIA, MOUNT VERNON, March 28, 1785. 
SIR: 

In pursuance of directions from the legislatures of Virginia and 
Maryland, respectively to us given, we beg leave to represent to 
the State of Pennsylvania that it is in contemplation of the said 
two States to promote the clearing, and extending the navigation 
of Potomac, from tide-water, upwards, as far as the same may 
be found practicable, to open a convenient road from the head of 
such navigation, to the waters running into the Ohio, and to ren 
der these waters navigable, as far as may be necessary and proper. 
That the said works will require great expence, which may not be 
repaid, unless a free use be secured to the said States, and their 
citizens, of the waters of the Ohio and its branches, as far as the 
same lie within the limits of Pennsylvania ; that as essential 
advantages will accrue from such works to a considerable portion 
of the said State, it is thought reasonable that the legislature 
thereof should by some previous act engage, that for the encour 
agement of the said works, all articles of produce or merchandise, 
which may be conveyed to or from either of the said two States, 
through either of the said rivers, within the limits of Pennsyl 
vania, to or from any place without the said limits, shall pass 
throughout free from all duties or tolls whatsoever, other than such 
tolls as may be established and be necessary for reimbursing ex- 
pences incurred by the State, or its citizens, in clearing, or for 
defraying the expence of preserving the navigation of the said 
rivers. And that no articles imported into Pennsylvania through 
the channel or channels, or any part thereof to be opened as 
aforesaid, and rendered or used within the said State, shall be 
subject to any duties on imports, other than such articles would 
be subject to, if imported into the said State through any other 
channel whatsoever. 

We request Sir, that you will take the earliest opportunity of 
laying this representation, on behalf of the two States, before the

legislature of Pennsylvania ; and that you will communicate the 
result to the executives of Virginia and Maryland. 

By acts of the legislatures of Virginia and Maryland for opening 
the navigation of the river Potomac above tide-water, the citizens 
of the United States have the same right of trading through the 
said water, which the citizens of Maryland and Virginia enjoy ; 
and we have no doubt but the legislature of your State will, 
agreeably to this principle, give every encouragement to measures 
which have for their object, the interest and convenience of their 
citizens, and those of the other States in the Union. 

We have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, Sir, your 
most obedient servants,

ROUGH DRAFT OF A PAPER, APPARENTLY IN THE HAND OF 
G. MASON, WITH ERASURES AND INTERLINEATIONS. 

At a time when our government is approaching to dissolution, 
when some of its principles have been found utterly inadequate 
to the purposes for which it was established, and it is evident 
that without some material alterations it can not much longer 
subsist, it must give real concern to every man who has his 
country s interest at heart to find such a difference of sentiment 
and opinion in an assembly of the most respectable and confi 
dential characters in America, appointed for the special purpose 
of revising and amending the federal constitution, so as to obtain 
and preserve the important objects for which it was instituted 
the protection, safety and happiness of the people. We all agree 
in the necessity of new regulations ; but we differ widely in our 
opinions of what are the safest and most effectual. Perhaps this 
contrariety of sentiment arises from our not thoroughly consider 
ing the peculiar circumstances, situation, character and genius of 
the people of America, differing materially from that of any other 
nation. The history of other nations has been minutely investi 
gated, examples have been drawn from and arguments founded 
on the practice of countries very dissimilar to ours. The treaties, 
leagues, and confederacies between different sovereign, indepen- 



APPENDIX. 387 



dent powers have been urged as proofs in support of the propriety 
and justice of the single and equal representation of each indi 
vidual State in the American Union ; and thence conclusions 
have been drawn that the people of these United States would 
refuse to adopt a government founded more on an equal 
representation of the people themselves, than on the distinct 
representation of each separate, individual State. If the different 
States in our Union always had been as now substantially and in 
reality distinct, sovereign and independent, this kind of reason 
ing would have great force ; but if the premises on which it is 
founded are mere assumptions not founded on facts, or at best 
upon facts to be found only upon a paper of yesterday, and even 
these contradictory to each other, no satisfactory conclusions can 
be drawn from them. 

OBJECTIONS TO THIS CONSTITUTION OF GOVERNMENT. 

There is no Declaration of Rights, and the laws of the general 
government being paramount to the laws and constitution of the 
several States, the Declarations of Rights in the separate States 
are no security. Nor are the people secured even in the enjoy 
ment of the benefit of the common law [which stands here upon 
no other foundation than its having been adopted by the respec 
tive acts forming the constitutions of the several States]. 

In the House of Representatives there is not the substance but 
the shadow only of representation ; which can never produce 
proper information in the legislature, or inspire confidence in the 
people ; the laws will therefore be generally made by men little 
concerned in, and unacquainted with their effects and conse 
quences. [This objection has been in some degree lessened by 
an amendment, often before refused and at last made by an erasure, 
after the engrossment upon parchment of the word forty and 
inserting thirty, in the third clause of the second section of the 
first article.] 

The Senate have the power of altering all money bills, and of 
originating appropriations of money, and the salaries of the 
officers of their own appointment, in conjunction with the presi 
dent of the United States, although they are not the representatives 
of the people or amenable to them. 



388 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

These with their other great powers, viz. : their power in the 
appointment of ambassadors and all public officers, in making 
treaties, and in trying all impeachments, their influence upon and 
connection with the supreme Executive from these causes, their 
duration of office and their being a constantly existing body, 
almost continually sitting, joined with their being one complete 
branch of the legislature, will destroy any balance in the govern 
ment, and enable them to accomplish what ursurpations they 
please upon the rights and liberties of the people. 

The Judiciary of the United States is so constructed and ex 
tended, as to absorb and destroy the judiciaries of the several 
States ; thereby rendering law as tedious, intricate and expensive, 
and justice as unattainable, by a great part of the community, as 
in England, and enabling the rich to oppress and ruin the poor. 

The President of the United States has no Constitutional Coun 
cil, a thing unknown in any safe and regular government. He 
will therefore be unsupported by proper information and advice, 
and will generally be directed by minions and favorites ; or he 
will become a tool to the Senate or a Council of State will grow 
out of the principal officers of the great departments ; the worst 
and most dangerous of all ingredients for such a Council in a free 
country ; [for they may be induced to join in any dangerous or 
oppressive measures, to shelter themselves, and prevent an inquiry 
into their own misconduct in office. Whereas, had a constitu 
tional council been formed (as was proposed) of six members, 
viz. : two from the Eastern, two from the Middle, and two from 
the Southern States, to be appointed by vote of the States in the 
House of Representatives, with the same duration and rotation of 
office as the Senate, the executive^ would always have had safe and 
proper information and advice ; the president of such a council 
might have acted as Vice-President of the United States pro tern- 
pore^ upon any vacancy or disability of the chief magistrate ; and 
long continued sessions of the Senate, would in a great measure 
have been prevented.] Trom this fatal defect has arisen the im 
proper power of the Senate_ in the appointment of public officers, 
and the alarming dependence and connection between that branch 
of the legislature and the supreme Executive. 

Hence also sprung that unnecessary [and dangerous] officer 
the Vice-President, who for want of other employment is made 



APPENDIX. 389 



president of the Senate, thereby dangerously blending the execu 
tive and legislative powers, besides always giving to some one of 
the States an unnecessary and unjust pre-eminence over the others. 

The President of the United States has the unrestrained power 
of granting pardons for treason, which may be sometimes exer 
cised to screen from punishment those whom he had secretly 
instigated to commit the crime, and thereby prevent a discovery 
of his own guilt. 

By declaring all treaties supreme laws of the land, the Execu 
tive and the Senate have, in many cases, an exclusive power of 
legislation ; which might have been avoided by proper distinctions 
with respect to treaties, and requiring the assent of the House of 
Representatives, where it could be done with safety. 

By requiring only a majority to make all commercial and navi 
gation laws, the five Southern States, whose produce and circum 
stances are totally different from that of the eight Northern and 
Eastern States, may [will] be ruined, for such rigid and premature 
regulations may be made as will enable the merchants of the 
Northern and Eastern States not only to demand an exhorbitant 
freight, but to monopolize the purchase of the commodities at 
their own price, for many years, to the great injury of the landed 
interest, and [the] impoverishment of the people ; and the danger 
is the greater as the gain on one side will be in proportion to the 
loss on the other. Whereas requiring two-thirds of the members 
present in both Houses would have produced mutual moderation, 
promoted the general interest, and removed an insuperable objec 
tion to the adoption of this [the] government. 

Under their own construction of the general .clause, at the end 
of the enumerated powers, the Congress may grant monopolies in 
trade and commerce, constitute new crimes, inflict unusual and 
severe punishments, and extend their powers [power] as far as 
they shall think proper ; so that -the State legislatures have no 
security for the powers now presumed to remain to them, or the 
people for their rights. v 

There is no declaration of any kind, for preserving the liberty 
of the press, or the trial by jury in civil eauses [cases] ; nor against 
the danger of standing armies in time of peace. 

The State legislatures are restrained from laying export duties 
on their own produce. 



390 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

Both the general legislature and the State legislature are ex 
pressly prohibited making ex post facto laws ; though there never 
was nor can be a legislature but must and will make such laws, 
when necessity and the public safety require them ; which will 
hereafter be a breach of all the constitutions in the Union, and 
afford precedents for other innovations. 

This government will set out [commence] a moderate aristoc 
racy : it is at present impossible to foresee whether it will, in its 
operation, produce a monarchy, or a corrupt, tyrannical [oppres 
sive] aristocracy ; it will most probably vibrate some years between 
the two, and then terminate in the one or the other. 

The general legislature is restrained from prohibiting the fur 
ther importation of slaves for twenty odd years ; though such 
importations render the United States weaker, more vulnerable, 
and less capable of defence.

III. 

SPEECHES IN THE CONVENTION OF 1788. 

Richmond, June 2, 1788. G. Mason put on the committee of 
privileges and elections. He is second on the list. B. Harrison 
first. Gov. Randolph third. Clerk and printer appointed. Then 
on motion of G. M. the Convention adjourned until the next day, 
to meet at the New Academy on Schockoe Hill. 

Tuesday, June j. Serjeant-at-arms and door-keeper appointed. 
Rules and regulations resolved on similar to those in House of 
Delegates. Resolution of Congress, read of Sept. 28, report of 



APPENDIX. 391 



Federal Convention, together with resolutions of General Assem 
bly of October 25, and act of Assembly concerning the Conven 
tion now held. 

Whereupon Mr. Mason addressed the president [Mr. Pendleton\ 
as follows : Mr. President, I hope and trust, sir, that this Convention, 
appointed by the people, on this great and important occasion, for 
securing, as far as possible, to the latest generation, the happiness 
and liberty of the people, will freely and fully investigate this im 
portant subject. For this purpose I humbly conceive the fullest and 
clearest investigation indispensably necessary, and that we ought 
not to be bound by any general rules whatsoever. The curse 
denounced by the divine vengeance will be small compared to 
what will justly fall upon us, if from any sinister views we obstruct 
the fullest inquiry. This subject, therefore, ought to obtain the 
freest discussion, clause by clause, before any general previous ques 
tion be put ; nor ought it to be precluded by any other question. 

Mr. Tyler moved that the Convention should resolve itself into 
a Committee of the whole Convention, to-morrow, to take into 
consideration the proposed plan of government, in order to have 
a fairer opportunity of examining its merits. 

Mr. Mason, after recapitulating his former reasons for having 
urged a full discussion, clause by clause, concluded by agreeing 
with Mr. Tyler that a Committee of the whole Convention was 
the proper mode of proceeding. 

Mr. Madison concurred with the honorable gentleman in going 
into a full and free investigation of the subject before them, and 
said he had no objection to the plan proposed. Mr. Mason then 
moved the following resolution, which was agreed to by the Con 
vention unanimously : 

Resolved, That no question, general or particular, shall be pro 
pounded in this Convention, upon the proposed Constitution of 
government for the United States, or upon any clause or article 
thereof, until the said Constitution shall have been discussed, 
clause by clause, through all its parts. 

Mr. Tyler said he should renew his motion &c. 

Mr. Lee urged the necessity of immediately entering into the 
discussion. 

Mr. Mason. Mr. President, no man in this Convention is more 
averse to take up the time of the Convention than I am ; but I am 



392 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

equally against hurrying them precipitately into any measure. I 
humbly conceive, sir, that the members ought to have time to 
consider the subject. Precious as time is, we ought not to run 
into the discussion before we have the proper means. 

Wednesday, June 4. The preamble and two first sections of 
Article I. were read. Mr. Nicholas made a long speech in favor 
of the Constitution. Patrick Henry spoke against it animadverted 
on the words " We, the people " thought it should have been " We y 
the States." Gov. Randolph replied to Henry and concluded his 
speech thus : " In the whole of this business I have acted in the 
strictest obedience to the dictates of my conscience, in dischar 
ging what I conceive to be my duty to my country." He had re 
fused his signature, but as 8 States had adopted the Constitution, 
he was a friend to Union. 

Mr. George Mason. Mr. Chairman, whether the Constitution 
be good or bad, the present clause [Art. I., Sect. 2] clearly dis 
covers that it is a national government, and no longer a Confedera 
tion. I mean that clause which gives the first hint of the general 
government laying direct taxes. The assumption of this power of 
laying direct taxes does, of itself, entirely change the confedera 
tion of the States into one consolidated government. This power 
being at discretion, unconfined, and without any kind of control, 
must carry everything before it. The very idea of converting 
what was formerly a confederation to a consolidated government, 
is totally subversive of every principle which has hitherto gov 
erned us. This power is calculated to annihilate totally the State 
governments. Will the people of this great community submit 
to be individually taxed by two different and distinct powers ? 
Will they suffer themselves to be doubly harassed ? These two 
concurrent powers cannot exist long together ; the one will destroy 
the other : the general government being paramount to, and in 
every respect more powerful than the State governments, the latter 
must give way to the former. Is it to be supposed that one 
national government will suit so extensive a country, embracing 
so many climates, and containing inhabitants so very different in 
manners, habits and customs ? It is ascertained, by history, that 
there never was a government over a very extensive country with 
out destroying the liberties of the people : history also, supported 
by the opinions of the best writers, shows us that monarchy may 



APPENDIX. 393 



suit a large territory, and despotic governments ever so extensive a 
country, but that popular governments can only exist in small terri 
tories. Is there a single example, on the face of the earth, to support 
a contrary opinion ? Where is there one exception to this general 
rule ? Was there ever an instance of a general national govern 
ment extending over so extensive a country, abounding in such a 
variety of climates, &c., where the people retained their liberty ? 
I solemnly declare that no man is a greater friend to a firm union 
of the American States than I am ; but, sir, if this great end can 
be obtained without hazarding the rights of the people, why 
should we recur to such dangerous principles ? Requisitions have 
been often refused, sometimes from an impossibility of complying 
with them ; often from that great variety of circumstances which 
retards the collection of moneys ; and perhaps sometimes from a 
wilful design of procrastinating. But why shall we give up to the 
national government this power, so dangerous in its nature, and 
for which its members will not have sufficient information ? Is it 
not well known that what would be a proper tax in one State 
would be grievous in another ? The gentleman who has favored us 
with a eulogium in favor of this system, must, after all the encomi 
ums he has been pleased to bestow upon it, acknowledge that our 
federal representatives must be unacquainted with the situation of 
their constituents. Sixty-five members cannot possibly know the 
situation and circumstances of all the inhabitants of this immense 
continent. When a certain sum comes to be taxed, and the mode 
of levying to be fixed, they will lay the tax on that article which 
will be most productive and easiest in the collection, without con 
sulting the real circumstances or convenience of a country, with 
which, in fact, they cannot be sufficiently acquainted. 

The mode of levying taxes is of the utmost consequence ; and yet 
here it is to be determined by those who have neither knowledge of 
our situation, nor a common interest with us, nor a fellow-feeling 
for us. The subjects of taxation differs in three fourths, nay, I might 
say with truth, in four fifths of the States. If we trust the national 
government with an effectual way of raising the necessary sums, it 
is sufficient : everything we do further is trusting the happiness 
and rights of the people. Why, then, should we give up this 
dangerous power of individual taxation ? Why leave the manner 
of laying taxes to those who, in the nature of things, cannot be 



394 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

acquainted with the situation of those on whom they are to impose 
them, when it can be done by those who are well acquainted with 
it ? If, instead of giving this oppressive power, we give them such 
an effectual alternative as will answer the purpose, without en 
countering the evil and danger that might arise from it, then I 
would cheerfully acquiesce ; and would it not be far more eligible ? 
I candidly acknowledge the inefficacy of the Confederation ; but 
requisitions have been made which were impossible to be complied 
with requisitions for more gold and silver than were in the 
United States. If we give the general government the power of 
demanding their quotas of the States, with an alternative of laying 
direct taxes in case of non-compliance, then the mischief would 
be avoided ; and the certainty of this conditional power would, in 
all human probability, prevent the application, and the sums 
necessary for the Union would be then laid by the States, by those 
who know how it can best be raised, by those who have a fellow- 
feeling for us. Give me leave to say, that the sum raised one way 
with convenience and ease, would be very oppressive another way. 
Why, then, not leave this power to to be exercised by those who 
know the mode most convenient for the inhabitants, and not by 
those who must necessarily apportion it in such manner as shall 
be oppressive ? 

With respect to the representation so much applauded, I 
cannot think it such a full and free one as it is represented ; but 
I must candidly acknowledge that this defect results from the 
very nature of the government. It would be impossible to have 
a full and adequate representation in the general government ; 
it would be too expensive and too unwieldy. We are, then, under 
the necessity of having this a very inadequate representation. Is 
this general representation to be compared with the real, actual, 
substantial representation of the State legislatures ? It cannot bear 
a comparison. To make representation real and actual, the num 
ber of representatives ought to be adequate ; they ought to mix 
with the people, think as they think, feel as they feel, ought to be 
perfectly amenable to them, and thoroughly acquainted with their 
interest and condition. Now, these great ingredients are either 
not at all, or in a small degree, to be found in our federal repre 
sentatives ; so that we have no real, actual, substantial representa 
tion ; but I acknowledge it results from the nature of the 



APPENDIX. 395 



government. The necessity of this inconvenience may appear a 
sufficient reason not to argue against it ; but, sir, it clearly shows 
that we ought to give power with a sparing hand to a government 
thus imperfectly constructed. To a government which, in the 
nature of things, cannot but be defective, no powers ought to be 
given but such as are absolutely necessary. There is one thing in 
it which I conceive to be extremely dangerous. Gentlemen may 
talk of public virtue and confidence ; we shall be told that the 
House of Representatives will consist of the most virtuous men on 
the continent, and that in their hands we may trust our dearest 
rights. This, like all other assemblies, will be composed of some 
bad and some good men ; and considering the natural lust of 
power so inherent in man, I fear the thirst of power will prevail 
to oppress the people. What I conceive to be so dangerous, is the 
provision with respect to the number of representatives ; it does not 
expressly provide that we shall have one for every thirty thousand, 
but that the number shall not exceed that proportion. The ut 
most that we can expect (and perhaps that is too much) is, that the 
present number shall be continued to us ; " the number of repre 
sentatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand." Now 
will not this be complied with, although the present number 
should never be increased nay, although it should be decreased ? 
Suppose Congress should say that we should have one for every 
200 thousand ; will not the Constitution be complied with ? for 
one for every 200 thousand does not exceed one for every 
thirty thousand. 

There is a want of proportion that ought to be strictly guarded 
against. The worthy gentleman tells us that we have no reason 
to fear ; but I always fear for the rights of the people. I do 
not pretend to inspiration ; but I think it is apparent as the day, 
that the members will attend to local, partial interests, to prevent 
an augmentation of their number. I know not how they will be 
chosen ; but, whatever be the mode of choosing, our present 
numbers will be ten ; and suppose our State is laid off in ten 
districts, those gentlemen who shall be sent from those districts 
will lessen their own power and influence in their respective dis 
tricts if they increase their number ; for the greater the number 
of men among whom any given quantum of power is divided, 
the less the power of each individual. Thus they will have a 



396 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

local interest to prevent the increase of, and perhaps they will 
lessen their own number. This is evident on the face of the 
Constitution : so loose an expression ought to be guarded against, 
for Congress will be clearly within the requisition of the Con 
stitution although the number of representatives should always 
continue what it is now, and the population of the country 
should increase to an immense number. Nay, they may reduce 
the number from sixty-five to one from each State, without violat 
ing the Constitution ; and thus the number, which is now too 
small, would then be infinitely too much so. But my principal 
objection is, that the Confederation is converted to one general 
consolidated government, which, from my best judgement of it, 
(and which perhaps will be shown, in the course of this discussion, 
to be really well founded,) is one of the worst curses that can pos 
sibly befall a nation. Does any man suppose that one general 
national government can exist in so extensive a country as this. I 
hope that a government may be framed which may suit us, by 
drawing a line between the general and State governments, and 
prevent that dangerous clashing of interest and power, which 
must, as it now stands, terminate in the destruction of one or the 
other. When we come to the judiciary, we shall be more con 
vinced that this government will terminate in the annihilation of 
the State governments : the question then will be, whether a 
consolidated government can preserve the freedom and secure 
the rights of the people. 

If such amendments be introduced as shall exclude danger, I 
shall most gladly put my hand to it. When such amendments as 
shall, from the best information, secure the great essential rights 
of the people, shall be agreed to by gentlemen, I shall most 
heartily make the greatest concessions, and concur in any reason 
able measure to obtain the desirable end of conciliation and una 
nimity. An indispensable amendment in this case is, that Congress 
shall not exercise the power of raising direct taxes till the States 
shall have refused to comply with the requisitions of Congress. 
On this condition it may be granted ; but I see no reason to 
grant it unconditionally, as the States can raise the taxes with 
more ease, and lay them on the inhabitants with more propriety, 
than it is possible for the general government to do. If Congress 
hath this power, without control, the taxes will be laid by those 



APPENDIX. 



397 



who have no fellow-feeling or acquaintance with the people. This 
is my objection to the article now under consideration. It is a 
very great and important one. I therefore beg gentlemen to con 
sider it. Should this power be restrained, I shall withdraw my 
objections to this part of the Constitution ; but as it stands, it is 
an objection so strong in my mind, that its amendment is with me 
a sine qua non of its adoption. I wish for such amendments, and 
such only, as are necessary to secure the dearest rights of the 
people. 

Wednesday, June n. Madison made the opening speech. Some 
conversation then followed on the mode of discussion [ ist and 2 nd 
Henry advocating as the best plan, to discuss it at large Sections, 
Madison approving of a regular, progressive discussion. 

Mr. George Mason. Mr. Chairman, gentlemen will be pleased 
to consider that, on so important a subject as this, it is impossible 
in the nature of things, to avoid arguing more at large than is 
usual. You will allow that I have not taken up a great part of 
your time. But as gentlemen have indulged themselves in entering 
at large into the subject, I hope to be permitted to follow them, 
and answer their observations. 

The worthy member, (Mr. Nicholas,) at a very early day, gave 
us an accurate detail of the representation of the people in Britain, 
and of the rights of the King of Britain ; and illustrated his ob 
servations by a quotation from Dr. Price. Gentlemen will please 
to take notice that those arguments relate to a single government, 
and that they are not applicable to this case. However applicable 
they may be to such a government as that of Great Britain, it will 
be entirely inapplicable to such a government as ours. The gentle 
man in drawing a comparison between the representation of the 
people in the House of Commons, in England, and the represen 
tation in the government now proposed to us, has been pleased to 
express his approbation in favor of the American government. 
Let us examine. I think that there are about 550 members in the 
English House of Commons. The people of Britain have a rep 
resentation in Parliament of five hundred and fifty members, who 
intimately mingle with all classes of the people, feeling and know 
ing their circumstances. In the proposed American government 
in a country perhaps ten times more extensive we are to have a 
representation of sixty-five, who from the nature of the govern- 



398 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

ment, cannot possibly be mingled with the different classes of the 
people, nor have a fellow-feeling for them. 

They must form an aristocracy, and will not regard the interest 
of the people. Experience tells us that men pay most regard to 
those whose rank and situation are similar to their own. In the 
course of the investigation, the gentleman mentioned the bribery 
and corruption of Parliament, and drew a conclusion the very re 
verse of what I should have formed on the subject. He said, if I 
recollect rightly, that the American representation is more secured 
against bribery and corruption, than the English Parliament. Are 
sixty-five better than five hundred and fifty ? Bribery and corrup 
tion, in my opinion, will be practised in America more than in Eng 
land, in proportion as five hundred and fifty exceed sixty-five ; and 
there will be less integrity and probity in proportion as sixty-five is 
less than five hundred and fifty. From what source is the bribery 
practised in the British Parliament derived ? I think the principal 
source is the distribution of places, offices, and posts. Will any 
gentleman deny this ? Give me leave, on this occasion, to recur to 
that clause of the Constitution which speaks of restraint, and has 
the appearance of restraining from corruption, &c., but which, 
when examined, will be found to be no restraint at all. The clause 
runs thus : " No senator or representative shall, during the time 
for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office, under 
the authority of the United States, which shall have been created, 
or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased, during such 
time ; and no person holding any office under the United States 
shall be a member of either house during his continuance in 
office." This appears to me to be no restraint at all. It is to be 
observed that this restraint only extends to civil officers. 

But I will not examine whether it be a proper distinction or 
not. What is the restraint as to civil officers ? Only that they 
shall not be appointed to offices which shall have been created, or 
the emoluments whereof shall have been increased, during the 
time for which they shall have been elected. They may be ap 
pointed to existing offices, if the emoluments be not increased 
during the time for which they were elected. 

[Here Mr. Mason spoke too low to he heard.] 

Thus, after the government is set in motion, the restraint will be 
gone. They may appoint what number of officers they please. 



APPENDIX. 399 



They may send ambassadors to every part of Europe. Here 
is, sir, I think, as wide a door for corruption as in any govern 
ment in Europe. There is the same inducement for corruption, 
there is the same room for it, in this government, which they have 
in the British government ; and in proportion as the number is 
smaller, corruption will be greater. 

That unconditional power of taxation which is given to that 
government cannot but oppress the people. If, instead of this, a 
conditional power of taxation be given, in case of refusal to com 
ply with requisitions, the same end will be answered with conven 
ience to the people. This will not lessen the power of Congress ; 
we do not want to lessen the power of Congress unnecessarily. 
This will produce moderation in the demand, and will prevent 
the ruinous exercise of that power by those who know not our 
situation. We shall then have that mode of taxation which is the 
most easy, and least oppressive to the people, because it will be 
exercised by those who are acquainted with their condition and 
circumstances. This, sir, is the great object we wish to secure 
that our people should be taxed by those who have a fellow- 
feeling for them. I think I can venture to assert that the general 
government will lay such taxes as are the easiest and the most 
productive in the collection. This is natural and probable. 

For example, they may lay a poll tax. This is simply and easily 
collected, but is of all taxes the most grievous. Why the most 
grievous ? Because it falls light on the rich, and heavy on the 
poor. It is most oppressive : for if the rich man is taxed, he can 
only retrench his superfluities ; but the consequence to the poor 
man is, that it increases his miseries. That they will lay the most 
simple taxes, and such as are easiest to collect, is highly probable, 
nay, almost absolutely certain. I shall take the liberty, on this 
occasion, to read you a letter, which will show, at least as far as 
opinion goes, what sort of taxes will be most probably laid on us, 
if we adopt this Constitution. It was the opinion of a gentleman 
of information. It will in some degree establish the fallacy of 
those reports which have been circulated through the country, 
and which induced a great many poor, ignorant people to believe 
that the taxes were to be lessened by the adoption of the pro 
posed government. 

[Here Mr. Mason read a letter from Mr. Robert Morris, finan- 



400 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

cier of the United States, to Congress, wherein he spoke of the 
propriety of laying the following taxes for the use of the United 
States ; viz., six shillings on every hundred acres of land, six 
shillings per poll, and nine pence per gallon on all spirituous 
liquors distilled in the country. Mr. Mason declared that he 
did not mean to make the smallest reflection on Mr. Morris, 
but introduced his letter to show what taxes would probably 
be laid.] 

He then continued : This will at least show that such taxes 
were in agitation, and were strongly advocated by a considerable 
part of Congress. I have read this letter to show that they will 
lay taxes most easy to be collected, without any regard to our 
convenience ; so that, instead of amusing ourselves with a 
diminution of our taxes, we may rest assured that they will be 
increased. But my principal reason for introducing it was, to 
show that taxes would be laid by those who are not acquainted 
with our situation, and that the agents of the collection may be 
consulted upon the most productive and simple mode of taxation. 
The gentleman who wrote this letter had more information on 
this subject than we have ; but this will show gentlemen that we 
are not to be eased of taxes. Any of those taxes which have 
been pointed out by this financier as the most eligible, will be 
ruinous and unequal, and will be particularly oppressive on the 
poorest part of the people. 

As to a poll tax, I have already spoken of its iniquitous opera 
tion, and need not say much of it, because it is so generally 
disliked in this State, that we were obliged to abolish it last 
year. As to a land tax, it will operate most unequally. The 
man who has one hundred acres of the richest land will pay as 
little as a man who has one hundred acres of the poorest land. 
Near Philadelphia, or Boston, an acre of land is worth one hun 
dred pounds ; yet the possessor of it will pay no more than the 
man with us whose land is hardly worth twenty shillings an acre. 
Some landholders in this State will have to pay twenty times as 
much as will be paid for all the land on which Philadelphia stands ; 
and as to excise, this will carry the exciseman to every farmer s 
house, who distils a little brandy, where he may search and 
ransack as he pleases. 

These I mention as specimens of the kind of tax which is to be 



APPENDIX. 401 



laid upon us by those who have no information of our situation, 
and by a government where the wealthy only are represented. 
It is urged that no new power is given up to the general govern 
ment, and that the Confederation had those powers before. That 
system derived its power from the State governments. When the 
people of Virginia formed their government, they reserved certain 
great powers in the bill of rights. They would not trust their 
own citizens, who had a similarity of interest with themselves, 
and who had frequent and intimate communication with them. 
They would not trust their own fellow-citizens, I say, with the 
exercise of those great powers reserved in the bill of rights. Do 
we not, by this system give up a great part of the rights, reserved 
by the bill of rights to those who have no fellow-feeling for the 
people to a government where the representatives will have no 
communication with the people ? I say, then, there are great 
and important powers, which were not transferred to the State 
government, given up to the general government by this Consti 
tution. Let us advert to the 6th article. It expressly declares, 
that " this Constitution, and the laws of the United States which 
shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or 
which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, 
shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every 
State shall be bound thereby ; anything in the Constitution or 
laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding." Now, sir, if 
the laws and Constitution of the general government, as expressly 
said, be paramount to those of any State, are not those rights 
with which we were afraid to trust our own citizens annulled and 
given up to the general government ? The bill of rights is a part 
of our own Constitution. The judges are obliged to take notice 
of the laws of the general government ; consequently, the rights 
secured by our bill of rights are given up. If they are not given 
up, where are they secured ? By implication ! Let gentlemen 
show that they are secured in a plain, direct, unequivocal manner. 
It is not in their power. Then where is the security ? where is 
the barrier drawn between the government and the rights of the 
citizens, as secured in our own State government ? These rights 
are given up in that paper ; but I trust that this Convention will 
never give them up, but will take pains to secure them to the 
latest posterity. If a check be necessary in our own State 

VOL. II. 26 



4O2 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

government, it is much more so in a government where our 
representatives are to be at the distance of a thousand miles from 
us, without any responsibility. 

I said, the other day, that they could not have sufficient 
information. I was asked how the legislature of Virginia got 
their information. The answer is easy and obvious. They get 
it from one hundred and sixty representatives dispersed through 
all parts of the country. In this government how do they get it ? 
Instead of one hundred and sixty, there are but ten chosen, 
if not wholly, yet mostly, from the higher order of the people 
from the great, the wealthy the well-born the well-born, Mr. 
Chairman, that aristocratic idol that flattering idea that exotic 
plant which has been lately imported from the ports of Great 
Britain, and planted in the luxurious soil of this country. 

In the course of the investigation, much praise has been 
lavished upon the article which fixes the number of representa 
tives. It only says that the proportion shall not exceed one for 
every thirty thousand. 

The worthy gentleman says that the number must be increased, 
[Nicholas, because representation and taxation are in proportion, 
June 6.] an d that one cannot be increased without increasing 
the other, nor decreased without decreasing the other. Let us 
examine the weight of this argument. If the proportion of each 
State equally and ratably diminishes, the words of the Constitu 
tion will be as much satisfied as if it had been increased in the 
same manner, without any reduction of the taxes. Let us illus 
trate it familiarly. Virginia has ten representatives ; Maryland 
has six. Virginia will have to pay a sum in proportion, greater 
than Maryland, as ten to six. Suppose Virginia reduced to five, 
and Maryland to three. The relative proportion of money, paid 
by each, will be the same as before ; and yet the honorable gentle 
man said, that if this did not convince us, he would give up. 
I am one of those unhappy men who cannot be amused with 
assertions. A man from the dead might frighten me ; but I am 
sure that he could not convince me without using better argu 
ments than I have yet heard. The same gentleman showed us 
that though the Northern States had a most decided majority 
against us, yet the increase of population among us would, in the 
course of years, change it in our favor. A very sound argument 



APPENDIX, 403 



indeed, that we should cheerfully burn ourselves to death in 
hopes of a joyful and happy resurrection ! 

The very worthy gentleman who presides was pleased to tell us 
that there was no interference between the legislation of the 
general government and that of the State legislatures. Pardon 
me if I show the contrary. In the important instance of taxation 
there is a palpable interference. Suppose a poll tax ; the general 
government can lay a poll tax ; the State legislatures can do the 
same ; and yet it is said there can be no interference. 

My honorable colleague in the late federal Convention, in an 
swer to another gentleman, who had said that the annals of man 
kind could afford no instance of rulers giving up power, has told 
us that eight States had adopted the Constitution, and that this 
was a relinquishment of power. Ought this example to have any 
weight with us ? If that relinquishment was imprudent, shall we 
imitate it ? I will venture to assert that, out of a thousand in 
stances where the people precipitately and unguardedly relin 
quished their power, there has not been one instance of a 
voluntary surrender of it back by rulers. He afterwards said, 
that freedom at home and respectability abroad would be the 
consequence of the adoption of this government, and that we can 
not exist without its adoption. Highly as I esteem that gentleman, 
highly as I esteem his historical knowledge, I am obliged to deny 
his assertions. 

If this government will endanger our liberties in its present 
state, its adoption will not promote our happiness at home. 
The people of this country are as independent, happy, and re 
spectable as those of any country. France is the most powerful 
and respectable nation on earth. Would the planters of this 
country change their shoes for the wooden shoes of the peasants 
of France ? Perhaps Russia is the next greatest power in Europe. 
Would we change situations with the people of Russia ? We have 
heard a great deal of Holland. Some have called its government 
a democracy ; others have called it an aristocracy. It is well 
known to be a republic. It has arisen to uncommon power and 
wealth. Compared to its neighboring countries, its fortune has 
been surprising. 

[Here Mr. Mason made a quotation, showing the comparative 
flourishing condition of the inhabitants of Holland, even a few 



404 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

years after they had shaken off the Spanish yoke ; that plenty and 
contentment were to be everywhere seen, the peasants well 
clothed, provisions plenty, their furniture and domestic utensils 
in abundance, and their lands well stocked ; that, on the con 
trary, the people of Spain were in a poor and miserable condition, 
in want of every thing of which the people of Holland enjoyed the 
greatest abundance.] 

Mr. Mason then continued : As this was within a few years 
after the Spanish revolution, this striking contrast could be owing 
to no other cause than the liberty which they enjoyed under their 
government. Here behold the difference between a powerful, 
great consolidation, and a confederacy. They tell us that if we 
be powerful and respectable abroad, we shall have liberty and 
happiness at home. Let us secure that liberty, that happiness first, 
and we shall then be respectable. 

I have some acquaintance with a great many characters who 
favor this government, their connections, their conduct, their 
political principles, and a number of other circumstances. There 
are a great many wise and good men among them. But when I 
look round the number of my acquaintance in Virginia, the 
country wherein I was born and have lived so many years, and ob 
serve who are the warmest and the most zealous friends to this new 
government, it makes me think of the story of the cat transformed 
into a fine lady : forgetting her transformation, and happening to 
see a rat, she could not restrain herself, but sprang upon it out of 
the chair. 

He (Governor Randolph) dwelt largely on the necessity of the 
union. A great many others have enlarged on this subject. 
Foreigners would suppose, from the declamation about union, that 
there was a great dislike in America to any general American 
government. I have never, in my whole life, heard one single 
man deny the necessity and propriety of the union. This neces 
sity is deeply impressed on every American mind. There can be 
no danger of any object being lost when the mind of every man 
in the country is strongly attached to it. But I hope that it is 
not to the name, but to the blessings of union, that we are at 
tached. Those gentlemen who are loudest in their praises of the 
name, are not more attached to the reality than I am. The 
security of our liberty and happiness is the object we ought to 



APPENDIX. 405 



have in view in wishing to establish the union. If, instead of 
securing these, we endanger them, the name of union will be but 
a trivial consolation. If the objections be removed, if those parts 
which are clearly subversive of our rights be altered, no man will 
go farther than I will to advance the union. We are told, in 
strong language, of dangers to which we will be exposed unless 
we adopt this Constitution. Among the rest, domestic safety is 
said to be in danger. This government does not intend our do 
mestic safety. It authorizes the importation of slaves for twenty 
odd years, and thus continues upon us that nefarious trade. In 
stead of securing and protecting us, the continuation of this 
detestable trade adds daily to our weakness. Though this evil is 
increasing, there is no clause in the Constitution that will prevent 
the Northern and Eastern States from meddling with our whole 
property of that kind. There is a clause to prohibit the importa 
tion of slaves after twenty years ; but there is no provision made 
for securing to the Southern States those they now possess. It is 
far from being a desirable property ; but it will involve us in great 
difficulties and infelicity to be now deprived of them. There 
ought to be a clause in the Constitution to secure us that prop 
erty which we have acquired under our former laws, and the loss 
of which would bring ruin on a great many people. 

Maryland and the Potomac have been mentioned. I have had 
some little means of being acquainted with that subject, having 
been one of the commissioners who made the compact with Mary 
land. There is no cause of fear on that ground. Maryland, says 
the gentleman, has a right to the navigation of the Potomac. 
This is a right which she never exercised. Maryland was pleased 
with what she had in return for a right which she never exercised. 
Every ship which comes within the State of Maryland, except 
some small boats, must come within our country. Maryland was 
very glad to get what she got by this compact, for she considered 
it as next to getting it without any compensation on her part. 
She considered it, at least, as next to a quid pro quo. 

The back land, he says, is another source of danger. Another 
day will show that, if that Constitution is adopted without amend 
ments, there are twenty thousand families of good citizens in the 
north-west district, between the Alleghany Mountains and the 
Blue Ridge, who will run the risk of being driven from their lands. 



406 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

They will be ousted from them by the Indiana Company by the 
survivors although their right and titles have been confirmed by 
the Assembly of our own State. I will pursue it no farther now, 
but take an opportunity to consider it another time. 

The alarming magnitude of our debts is urged as a reason for 
our adoption. And shall we, because involved in debts, take less 
care of our rights and liberties ? Shall we abandon them because 
we owe money which we cannot immediately pay ? Will this 
system enable us to pay our debts and lessen our difficulties ? 
Perhaps the new government possesses some secret, some power 
ful means of turning everything to gold. It has been called by 
one gentleman the philosopher s stone. The comparison was a 
pointed one, at least in this, that, on the subject of producing 
gold, they will be both equally delusive and fallacious. The one 
will be as inapplicable as the other. The dissolution of the Union, 
the dangers of separate confederacies, and the quarrels of bor 
derers, have been enlarged upon to persuade us to embrace this 
government. 

My honorable colleague in the late Convention seems to raise 
phantoms ; and to show a singular skill in exorcisms, to terrify 
and compel us to take the new government, with all its sins and 
dangers. I know that he once saw as great danger in it as I do. 
What has happened since to alter his opinion ? If anything, I 
know it not. But the Virginia legislature has occasioned it, by 
postponing the matter. The Convention had met in June, instead 
of March or April. The liberty or misery of millions yet unborn 
are deeply concerned in our decision. When this is the case, I 
cannot imagine that the short period between the last of Septem 
ber and first of June ought to make any difference. The union 
between England and Scotland has been strongly instanced by 
the honorable gentleman to prove the necessity of our acceding 
to this new government. He must know that the act of union 
secured the rights of the Scotch nation. The rights and privi 
leges of the people of Scotland are expressly secured. We wish 
only our rights to be secured. We must have such amendments 
as will secure the liberties and happiness of the people on a plain, 
simple construction, not on a doubtful ground. We wish to give 
the government sufficient energy, on real republican principles ; 
but we wish to withhold such powers as are not absolutely neces- 



APPENDIX. 407 



sary in themselves, but extremely dangerous. We wish to shut 
the door against corruption in that place where it is most danger 
ous to secure against the corruption of our own representatives. 
We ask such amendments as will point out what powers are 
reserved to the State governments, and clearly discriminate 
between them and those which are given to the general govern 
ment, so as to prevent future disputes and clashing of interests. 
Grant us amendments like these, and we will cheerfully, with our 
hands and hearts, unite with those who advocate it, and we will 
do everything we can to support and carry it into execution. But 
in its present form we never can accede to it. Our duty to God 
and to our posterity forbids it. We acknowledge the defects of 
the Confederation, and the necessity of a reform. We ardently 
wish for a union with our sister States, on terms of security. 
This I am bold to declare is the desire of most of the people. 
On these terms we will most cheerfully join with the warmest 
friends of this Constitution. On another occasion I shall point 
out the great dangers of this Constitution, and the amendments 
which are necessary. I will likewise endeavor to show that 
amendments after ratification are delusive and fallacious perhaps 
utterly impracticable. 

Saturday, June 14, [Art. I., Section 8.] 

Mr. George Mason. Mr. Chairman, unless there be some 
restrictions on the power of calling forth the militia, to execute 
the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions, 
we may very easily see that it will produce dreadful oppressions. 
It is extremely unsafe, without some alterations. It would be to 
use the militia to a very bad purpose, if any disturbance happened 
in New Hampshire, to call them from Georgia. This would 
harass the people so much that they would agree to abolish the 
use of the militia, and establish a standing army. I conceive the 
general government ought to have power over the militia, but it 
ought to have some bounds. If gentlemen say that the militia of 
a neighboring State is not sufficient, the government ought to have 
power to call forth those of other States, the most convenient and 
contiguous. But in this case, the consent of the State legislatures 
ought to be had. On real emergencies, this consent will never be 
denied, each State being concerned in the safety of the rest. 
This power may be restricted without any danger. I wish such 



408 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

an amendment as this that the militia of any State should not be 
marched beyond the limits of the adjoining State ; and if it be 
necessary to draw them from one end of the continent to the 
other, I wish such a check, as the consent of the State legislature, 
to be provided. Gentlemen may say that this would impede the 
government, and that the State legislatures would counteract it 
by refusing their consent. This argument may be applied to all 
objections whatsoever. How is this compared to the British 
constitution ? Though the King may declare war, the Parliament 
has the means of carrying it on. It is not so here. Congress can 
do both. Were it not for that check in the British government, 
the monarch would be a despot. When a war is necessary for 
the benefits of the nation, the means of carrying it on are never 
denied. If any unjust requisition be made on Parliament, it will 
be, as it ought to be, refused. The same principle ought to be 
observed in our government. In times of real danger, the States 
will have the same enthusiasm in aiding the general government, 
and granting its demands, which is seen in England, when the 
King is engaged in a war apparently for the interest of the nation. 
This power is necessary ; but we ought to guard against danger. 
If ever they attempt to harass and abuse the militia, they may 
abolish them, and raise a standing army in their stead. There 
are various ways of destroying the militia. A standing army may 
be perpetually established in their stead. I abominate and detest 
the idea of a government where there is a standing army. The 
militia may be here destroyed by that method which has been 
practised in other parts of the world before ; that is, by rendering 
them useless by disarming them. Under various pretences 
Congress may neglect to provide for arming and disciplining the 
militia ; and the State governments cannot do it, for Congress has 
an exclusive right to arm them, &c. Here is a line of division 
drawn between them the State and general governments. The 
power over the militia is divided between them. The national 
government has an exclusive right to provide for arming, organ 
izing, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of 
them as may be employed in the service of the United States. 
The State governments have the power of appointing the officers, 
and of training the militia, according to the discipline prescribed 
by Congress, if they should think proper to prescribe any. 



APPENDIX. 409 



Should the national government wish to render the militia useless, 
they may neglect them, and let them perish, in order to have a 
pretence of establishing a standing army. 

No man has a greater regard for the military gentlemen than I 
have. I admire their intrepidity, perseverance, and valor. But 
when once a standing army is established in any country, the 
people lose their liberty. When, against a regular and disciplined 
army, yeomanry are the only defence, yeomanry, unskilful and 
unarmed what chance is there for preserving freedom ? Give me 
leave to recur to the page of history, to warn you of your present 
danger. Recollect the history of most nations of the world. 
What havoc, desolation and destruction, have been perpetrated by 
standing armies ! An instance within the memory of some of this 
house will show us how our militia may be destroyed. Forty 
years ago, when the resolution of enslaving America was formed 
in Great Britain, the British Parliament was advised by an artful 
man [Sir William Keith] who was governor of Pennsylvania, to 
disarm the people ; that it was the best and most effectual way to 
enslave them ; but that they should not do it openly, but weaken 
them, and let them sink gradually, by totally disusing and neg 
lecting the militia. [Here Mr. Mason quoted sundry passages to 
this effect.] This was a most iniquitious project. Why should 
we not provide against the danger of having our militia, our real 
and natural strength destroyed ? The general government ought, 
at the same time, to have some such power. But we need not 
give them power to abolish our militia. If they neglect to arm 
them, and prescribe proper discipline, they will be of no use. I 
am not acquainted with the military profession. I beg to be ex 
cused for any errors I may commit with respect to it. But I stand 
on the general principles of freedom, whereon I dare to meet any 
one. I wish that, in case the general government should neglect 
to arm and discipline the militia, there should be an express dec 
laration that the State governments might arm and discipline 
them. With this single exception, I would agree to this part, as I 
am conscious the government ought to have the power. 

They may effect the destruction of the militia, by rendering the 
service odious to the people themselves, by harassing them from 
one end of the continent to the other, and by keeping them under 
martial law. 



410 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

The English Parliament never pass a mutiny bill but for one 
year. This is necessary ; for otherwise the soldiers would be on 
the same footing with the officers, and the army would be dis 
solved. One mutiny bill has been here in force since the revolu 
tion. I humbly conceive there is extreme danger of establishing 
cruel martial regulations. If, at any time, our rulers should have 
unjust and iniquitous designs against our liberties, and should 
wish to establish a standing army, the first attempt would be to 
render the service and use of militia odious to the people them 
selves subjecting them to unnecessary severity of discipline in 
time of peace, confining them under martial law, and disgusting 
them so much as to make them cry out, " Give us a standing 
army ! " I would wish to have some check to exclude this 
danger ; as, that the militia should never be subject to martial 
law but in time of war. I consider and fear the natural propensity 
of rulers to oppress the people. I wish only to prevent them 
from doing evil. By these amendments I would give necessary 
powers, but no unnecessary power. If the clause stands as it is 
now, it will take from the State legislatures what divine Providence 
has given to every individual the means of self-defence. Unless 
it be moderated in some degree, it will ruin us, and introduce a 
standing army. 

Mr. George Mason, after having read the clause which gives 
Congress power to provide for arming, organizing, and disciplining 
the militia, and governing those in actual service of the Union, 
declared it as his firm belief, that it included the power of annex 
ing punishments, and establishing necessary discipline, more es 
pecially as the construction of this, and every other part of the 
Constitution, was left to those who were to govern. If so, he 
asked if Congress could not inflict the most ignominious punish 
ments on the most worthy citizens of the community. Would 
freemen submit to such indignant treatment ? It might be thought 
a strained construction, but it was no more than Congress might 
put upon it. He thought such severities might be exercised on the 
militia as would make them wish the use of the militia to be utterly 
abolished, and assent to the establishment of a standing army. 
He then adverted to the representation, and said it was not suffi 
ciently full to take into consideration the feelings and sentiments 
of all the citizens. He admitted that the nature of the country 



APPENDIX. 411 



rendered a full representation impracticable. But he strongly 
urged that impractibility as a conclusive reason for granting no 
powers to the government but such as were absolutely indispen 
sable, and these to be most cautiously guarded. He then recurred 
to the power of impeachment. On this subject he entertained 
great suspicions. He apologized for being suspicious. He en 
tered into the world with as few suspicions as any man. Young 
men, he said, were apt to think well of every one, till time and 
experience taught them better. After a treaty manifestly repug 
nant to the interests of the country was made, he asked how they 
were to be punished. Suppose it had been made by the means 
of bribery and corruption. Suppose they had received one hun 
dred thousand guineas, or louis d ors, from a foreign nation, for 
consenting to a treaty, how was the truth to be come at ? Corrup 
tion and bribery of that kind had happened in other governments, 
and might in this. The House of Representatives were to im 
peach them. The senators were to try themselves. If a majority 
of them were guilty of the crime, would they pronounce them 
selves guilty ? Yet, says he, this is called responsibility. He 
wished to know in what court the members of the government 
were to be tried for the commission of indictable offences, or in 
juries to individuals. He acknowledged himself to be no lawyer ; 
but he thought he could see that they could be tried neither in 
the State nor federal courts. The only means, therefore, of 
bringing them to punishment, must be by a court appointed by 
law ; and the law to punish them must also be made by them 
selves. By whom is it to be made ? demanded he. By the very 
men who are interested in not inflicting punishment. Yet, says 
he, though they make the law, and fix the punishment to be 
inflicted on themselves, it is called responsibility. If the senators 
do not agree to the law, it will not be made, and thus they will 
escape altogether. 

[Mr. Mason then animadverted on the ultimate control of 
Congress over the elections, and was proceeding to prove that it 
was dangerous, when he was called to order, by Mr. Nicholas, 
for departing from the clause under consideration. A desultory 
conversation ensued, and Mr. Mason was permitted to proceed. 
He was of opinion that the control over elections tended to 
destroy responsibility. He declared he had endeavored to dis- 



412 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

cover whether this power was really necessary, or what was the 
necessity of vesting it in the government, but he could find no 
good reason for giving it ; that the reasons suggested were that, in 
case the States should refuse or neglect to make regulations, or 
in case they should be prevented from making regulations 
by rebellion or invasion, then the general government should 
interpose.] 

Mr. Mason then proceeded thus : If there be any other cases, I 
should be glad to know them ; for I know them not. If there be 
no other, why not confine them to these cases ? But the power 
here, as in a thousand other instances, is without reason. I have 
no power which any other person can take from me. I have no 
right of representation, if they can take it from me. I say, 
therefore, that Congress may, by this claim, take away the right 
of representation, or render it nugatory, despicable, or oppressive. 
It is at least argumentative, that what may be done will be done, 
and that a favorite point will be . done by those who can. 
Suppose the State of Virginia should adopt such regulations as 
gentlemen say, (and in which I accord with all my heart,) and 
divide the State into ten districts. Suppose then, that Congress 
should order, instead of this, that the elections should be held 
in the borough of Norfolk. Will any man say that any man in 
Frederick or Berkeley county would have any share in this 
representation, if the members were chosen in Norfolk ? Nay, I 
might go farther, and say that the elections for all the States 
might be had in New York, and then we should have to go so 
far that the privilege would be lost altogether ; for but few 
gentlemen could afford to go thither. Some of the best friends 
of the Constitution have advocated that the elections should be 
in one place. This power is not necessary, and is capable of 
great abuse. It ought to be confined to the particular cases 
in which they assert it to be necessary. Whatever gentlemen 
may think of the opposition, I will never agree to give any power 
which I conceive to be dangerous. 

I have doubts on another point. The 5th section of the ist 
article provides, " that each house shall keep a journal of its pro 
ceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such 
parts as may, in their judgment, require secrecy." This enables 
them to keep the negotiations about treaties secret. Under this 



APPENDIX. 413 



veil they may conceal anything and everything. Why not insert 
words that would exclude ambiguity and danger ? The words of 
the Confederation, that defective system, are, in this respect, more 
eligible. What are they ? In the last clause of the gih article it 
is provided, "that Congress shall publish the journal of their pro 
ceedings monthly, except such parts thereof, relating to treaties, 
alliances, or military operations, as, in their judgment, require 
secrecy." The proceedings, by that system, are to be published 
monthly, with certain exceptions. These are proper guards. It is 
not so here. On the contrary, they may conceal what they please. 
Instead of giving information, they will produce suspicion. You 
cannot discover the advocates of their iniquitous acts. This is 
an additional defect of responsibility. 

Neither house can adjourn, without the consent of the other, 
for more than three days. This is no parliamentary rule. It is 
untrodden ground, and it appears to me liable to much exception. 
The senators are chosen for six years. They are not recallable for 
those six years, and are ineligible at the end of the six years. It 
stands on a very different ground from the Confederation. By 
that system, they were only elected for one year, might be 
recalled, and were incapable of reelection. But in the new 
Constitution, instead of being elected for one, they are chosen for 
six years. They cannot be recalled, in all that time, for any 
misconduct ; and at the end of that long term may again be 
elected. What will be the operation of this ? Is it not probable that 
those gentlemen, who will be elected senators, will fix themselves 
in the federal town, and become citizens of that town more than 
of our State ? They will purchase a good seat in or near the 
town, and become inhabitants of that place. Will it not be, then, 
in the power of the Senate to worry the House of Representatives 
into anything ? They will be a continually existing body. They 
will exercise those machinations and contrivances which the 
many have always to fear from the few. The House of Repre 
sentatives is the only check on the Senate, with their enormous 
powers. But, by that clause, you give them the power of worry 
ing the House of Representatives into a compliance with any 
measure. The senators living on the spot will feel no incon 
venience from long sessions, as they will vote themselves hand 
some pay, without incurring any additional expenses. Your 



414 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

representatives are on a different ground from their shorter con 
tinuance in office. The gentlemen from Georgia are six or seven 
hundred miles from home, and wish to go home. The Senate, 
taking advantage of this, by stopping the other house from 
adjourning, may worry them into anything. These are my doubts, 
and I think the provision not consistent with the usual parlia 
mentary modes. 

Monday, June 16. [The 8th Section still under consideration.] 
Mr. George Mason asked to what purpose the laws were read. 
[Acts of the Va. Assembly concerning the militia read on 
motion of Madison.] The objection was, that too much power 
was given to Congress power that would finally destroy the 
State governments more effectually by insidious, underhanded 
means, than such as could be openly practised. This, said he, is 
the opinion of many worthy men, not only in this Convention, 
but in all parts of America. These laws could only show that 
the legislature of this State could pass such acts. He thought 
they militated against the cession of this power to Congress, 
because the State governments could call forth the militia when 
necessary, so as to compel a submission to the laws ; and as they 
were competent to it, Congress ought not to have the power. 
The meeting of three or four persons might be called an insurrec 
tion, and the militia might be called out to disperse them. He 
was not satisfied with the explanation of the word organization 
by the gentleman in the military line. (Mr. Lee.) He thought 
they were not confined to the technical explanation, but that 
Congress could inflict severe and ignominious punishments on 
the militia, as a necessary incident to the power of organizing 
and disciplining them. The gentleman had said there was no 
danger, because the laws respecting the militia were less rigid 
in the other States than this. This was no conclusive argu 
ment. His fears, as he had before expressed, were, that grievous 
punishments would be inflicted, in order to render the service 
disagreeable to the militia themselves, and induce them to wish 
its abolition, which would afford a pretence for establishing a 
standing army. He was convinced the State governments ought 
to have the control of the militia, except when they were abso 
lutely necessary for general purposes. The gentleman had said 
that they would be only subject to martial law when in actual 



APPENDIX. 415 



service. He demanded what was to hinder Congress from inflict 
ing it always, and making a general law for the purpose. If so, 
said he, it must finally produce, most infallibly, the annihilation 
of the State governments. These were his apprehensions ; but 
he prayed God they might be groundless. 

{Militia contin ued. ] 

Mr. George Mason. Mr. Chairman, a worthy member has 
asked who are the militia, if they be not \he people of this country, 
and if we are not to be protected from the fate of the Germans, 
Prussians, &c., by our representation ? I ask, who are the militia ? 
They consist now of the whole people, except a few public offi 
cers. But I cannot say who will be the militia of the future day. 
If that paper on the table gets no alteration, the militia of the 
future day may not consist of all classes, high and low, and rich 
and poor ; but they may be confined to the lower and middle 
classes of the people, granting exclusion to the higher classes of 
the people. If we should ever see that day, the most ignominious 
punishments and heavy fines may be expected. Under the pres 
ent government, all ranks of people are subject to militia duty. 
Under such a full and equal representation as ours, there can be 
no ignominious punishment inflicted. But under this national, 
or rather consolidated government, the case will be different. 
The representation being so small and inadequate, they will have 
no fellow-feeling for the people. They may discriminate people 
in their own predicament, and exempt from duty all the officers 
and lowest creatures of the national government. If there were a 
more particular definition of their powers, and a clause exempt 
ing the militia from martial law except when in actual service, and 
from fines and punishments of an unusual nature, then we might 
expect that the militia would be what they are. But, if this be 
not the case, we cannot say how long all classes of people will be 
included in the militia. There will not be the same reason to 
expect it, because the government will be administered by differ 
ent people. We know what they are now, but know not how 
soon they may be altered. 

[Mr. George Nicholas spoke next, and in reference to Mason 
and Gray son said : One objects because there will be select militia ; 
another objects because there will be no select militia ; and yet 
both oppose it on these contradictory principles, &c.] 



416 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

Mr. Mason rose, and said that he was totally misunderstood. 
The contrast between his friend s objection and his was improper. 
His friend had mentioned the propriety of having select militia, 
like those of Great Britain, who should be more thoroughly exer 
cised than the militia at large could possibly be. But he, himself, 
had not spoken of a selection of militia, but of the exemption of 
the highest classes of the people from militia service, which would 
justify apprehensions of severe and ignominious punishments. 

{Powers of Congress in District of Columbia^ 

Mr. George Mason thought that there were few clauses in the 
Constitution so dangerous as that which gave Congress exclusive 
power of legislation within ten miles square. Implication, he 
observed, was capable of any extension, and would probably be 
extended to augment the congressional powers. But here there 
was no need of implication. This clause gave them an unlimited 
authority in every possible case, within that district. This ten 
miles square, says Mr. Mason, may set at defiance the laws of the 
surrounding States, and may, like the custom of the superstitious 
days of our ancestors, become the sanctuary of the blackest 
crimes. Here the federal courts are to sit. We have heard a 
good deal said of justice. It has been doubted whether jury trial 
be secured in civil cases. But I will suppose that we shall have 
juries in civil cases. What sort of a jury shall we have within the 
ten miles square ? The immediate creatures of the government. 
What chance will poor men get, where Congress have the power 
of legislating in all cases whatever, and where judges and juries 
may be under their influence, and bound to support their opera 
tions ? Even with juries the chance of justice may here be very small, 
as Congress have unlimited authority, legislative, executive, and 
judicial. Lest this power should not be sufficient, they have it in 
every case. Now, sir, if an attempt should be made to establish 
tyranny over the people, here are ten miles square where the 
greatest offender may meet protection. If any of their officers, 
or creatures, should attempt to oppress the people, or should 
actually perpetrate the blackest deed, he has nothing to do but 
get into the ten miles square. Why was this dangerous power 
given. Felons may receive an asylum there and in their strong 
holds. Gentlemen have said that it was dangerous to argue 
against possible abuse, because there could be no power dele- 



APPENDIX. 417 



gated but might be abused. It is an incontrovertible axiom, that, 
when the dangers that may arise from the abuse are greater than 
the benefits that may result from the use, the power ought to be 
withheld. I do not conceive that this power is at all necessary, 
though capable of being greatly abused. 

We are told by the honorable gentleman [. Randolph} that 
Holland has its Hague. I confess I am at a loss to know what 
inference he could draw from that observation. This is the place 
where the deputies of the United Provinces meet to transact the 
public business. But I do not recollect that they have any ex 
clusive jurisdiction whatever in that place, but are subject to the 
laws of the province in which the Hague is. To what purpose 
the gentleman mentioned that Holland has its Hague, I cannot see. 

Mr. Mason then observed that he would willingly give them 
exclusive power, as far as respected the police and good govern 
ment of the place ; but he would give them no more, because he 
thought it unnecessary. He was very willing to give them, in this 
as well as in all other cases, those powers which he thought indis 
pensably necessary. 

[Art. I., Sect. 8, Clause 18.] 

Mr. George Mason. Mr. Chairman, gentlemen say there is 
no new power given by this clause. Is there any thing in this 
Constitution which secures to the States the powers which are 
said to be retained ? Will powers remain to the States which are 
not expressly guarded and reserved ? I will suppose a case. 
Gentlemen may call it an impossible case, and suppose that Con 
gress will act with wisdom and integrity. Among the enumerated 
powers, Congress are to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and 
excises, and to pay the debts, and to provide for the general 
welfare and common defence ; and by that clause (so often called 
the sweeping clause] they are to make all laws necessary to execute 
those laws. Now, suppose oppressions should arise under this 
government, and any writer should dare to stand forth, and expose 
to the community at large the abuses of those powers ; could not 
Congress under the idea of providing for the general r Alien and 
welfare, and under their own construction, say that this Sedition 
was destroying the general peace, encouraging sedition, laws ] 
and poisoning the minds of the people ? And could they not, in 
order to provide against this, lay a dangerous restriction o^ the 



VOL. II. 27 



41 8 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

press ? Might they not even bring the trial of this restriction 
within the ten miles square, when there is no prohibition against 
it ? Might they not thus destroy the trial by jury ? Would they 
not extend their implication ? It appears to me that they may 
and will. And shall the support of our right depend on the 
bounty of men whose interest it may be to oppress us ? That 
Congress should have power to provide for the general welfare of 
the Union, I grant. But I wish a clause in the Constitution, with 
respect to all powers which are not granted, that they are retained 
by the States. Otherwise, the power of providing for the general 
welfare may be perverted to its destruction. 

Many gentlemen, whom I respect, take different sides of this 
question. We wish this amendment to be introduced, to remove 
our apprehensions. There was a clause in the Confederation 
reserving to the States respectively every power, jurisdiction, and 
right, not expressly delegated to the United States. This clause 
has never been complained of, but approved by all. Why not, 
then, have a similar clause in this Constitution, in which it is the 
more indispensably necessary than in the Confederation, because 
of the great augmentation of power vested in the former ? In my 
humble apprehension, unless there be some such clear and definite 
expression, this clause now under consideration will go to any 
thing our rulers may think proper. Unless there be some express 
declaration that every thing not given is retained, it will be car 
ried to any power Congress may please. 

[Subject continued.] 

Mr. George Mason still thought that there ought to be some 
express declaration in the Constitution, asserting that rights not 
given to the general government were retained by the States. 
He apprehended that, unless this was done, many valuable and 
important rights would be concluded to be given up by implication. 
All governments were drawn from the people, though many were 
perverted to their oppression. The government of Virginia, he 
remarked, was drawn from the people ; yet there were certain 
great and important rights, which the people, by their bill of 
rights, declared to be paramount to the power of the legislature. 
He asked, Wliy should it not be so in this Constitution ? Was it 
because we were more substantially represented in it than in the 
State government ? If in the State government, where the people 



APPENDIX. 419 



were substantially and fully represented, it was necessary that the 
great rights of human nature should be secure from the encroach 
ments of the legislature, he asked if it was not more necessary in 
this government, where they were but inadequately represented ? 
He declared that artful sophistry and evasions could not satisfy 
him. He could see no clear distinction between rights relinquished 
by a positive grant, and lost by implication. Unless there were 
a bill of rights, implication might swallow up all our rights. 

[In answer to Mr. George Nicholas :] 

Mr. George Mason replied that the worthy gentleman was 
mistaken in his assertion that the bill of rights did not prohibit 
torture ; for that one clause expressly provided that no man can 
give evidence against himself ; and that the worthy gentleman 
must know that, in those countries where torture is used, evidence 
was extorted from the criminal himself. Another clause of the 
bill of rights provided that no cruel and unusual punishments 
shall be inflicted ; therefore, torture was included in the pro 
hibition. 

Tuesday June if. [Art. I., Sect. 9.] 

Mr. George Mason. Mr. Chairman, this is a fatal section, 
which has created more dangers than any other. The first clause 
allows the importation of slaves for twenty years. Under the 
royal government, this evil was looked upon as a great oppression, 
and many attempts were made to prevent it ; but the interest of 
the African merchants prevented its prohibition. No sooner did 
the revolution take place, than it was thought of. It was one of the 
great causes of our separation from Great Britain. Its exclusion 
has been a principal object of this State, and most of the States in 
the Union. The augmentation of slaves weakens the States ; and 
such a trade is diabolical in itself, and disgraceful to mankind ; 
yet, by this Constitution, it is continued for twenty years. As 
much as I value a union of all the States, I would not admit the 
Southern States into the Union unless they agree to the discon 
tinuance of this disgraceful trade, because it would bring weakness 
and not strength to the Union. And, though this infamous traffic 
be continued, we have no security for the property of that kind 
which we have already. There is no clause in this Constitution 
to secure it ; for they may lay such a tax as will amount to manu 
mission. And should the government be amended, still this 



420 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

detestable kind of commerce cannot be discontinued till after the 
expiration of twenty years ; for the 5th article which provides for 
amendments, expressly excepts this clause. I have ever looked 
upon this as a most disgraceful thing to America. I cannot 
express my detestation of it. Yet they have not secured us the 
property of the slaves we have already. So that "they have 
done what they ought not to have done, and have left undone 
what they ought to have done." 

[The 2d, 3d, and 4th clauses.] 

Mr. George Mason said, that gentlemen might think themselves 
secured by the restriction, in the 4th clause, that no capitation or 
other direct tax should be laid but in proportion to the census 
before directed to be taken ; but that, when maturely considered, 
it would be found to be no security whatsoever. It was nothing 
but a direct assertion, or mere confirmation of the clause which 
fixed the ratio of taxes and representation. It only meant that 
the quantum to be raised of each State should be in proportion to 
their numbers in the manner therein directed. But the general 
government was not precluded from laying the proportion of any 
particular State on any one species of property they might think 
proper. 

For instance, if five hundred thousand dollars were to be raised, 
they might lay the whole of the proportion of the Southern States 
on the blacks, or any one species of property ; so that by laying 
taxes too heavily on slaves, they might totally annihilate that kind 
of property. No real security could arise from the clause which 
provides that persons held to labor in one State, escaping into 
another, shall be delivered up. This only meant that runaway 
slaves should not be protected in other States. As to the ex 
clusion of ex post facto laws, it could not be said to create any 
security in this case ; for laying a tax on slaves would not be ex post 
facto. 

[The 5th and 6th clauses.] 

Mr. George Mason apprehended the loose expression of " pub 
lication from time to time " was applicable to any time. It was 
equally applicable to monthly and septennial periods. It might 
be extended ever so much. The reason urged in favor of this 
ambiguous expression was, that there might be some matters 
which require secrecy. In matters relative to military operations 



APPENDIX. 42 1 



and foreign negotiations, secrecy was necessary sometimes ; but 
he did not conceive that the receipts and expenditures of the 
public money ought ever to be concealed. The people, he af 
firmed, had a right to know the expenditures of their money ; but 
that this expression was so loose, it might be concealed forever 
from them, and might afford opportunities of misapplying the 
public money, and sheltering those who did it. He concluded it 
to be as exceptionable as any clause, in so few words, could be. 

Mr. Lee (of Westmoreland) thought such trivial arguments as 
that just used by the honorable gentleman would have no weight 
with the committee, &c. 

Mr. Mason begged to be permitted to use that mode of arguing 
to which he had been accustomed. However desirous he was of 
pleasing that worthy gentleman, his duty would not give way to 
that pleasure. 

[Mr. Nicholas, Mr. Corbin, Mr. Madison, approved of the 
clause.] 

Mr. Mason replied, that, in the Confederation, the public pro 
ceedings were to be published monthly, which was infinitely better 
than depending on men s virtue to publish them or not, as they 
might please. If there was no such provision in the Constitution 
of Virginia, gentlemen ought to consider the difference between 
such a full representation, dispersed and mingled with every part 
of the community, as the State representation was, and such an in 
adequate representation as this was. One might be safely trusted, 
but not the other. 

[The ist clause of the loth section.] 

Mr. George Mason declared he had been informed that some 
States had speculated most enormously in this matter [Continental 
money]. Many individuals had speculated so as to make great 
fortunes on the ruin of their fellow-citizens. The clause which 
has been read [Art. VI., Clause i], as a sufficient security, seemed 
to him to be satisfactory as far as it went ; that is, that the Con 
tinental money ought to stand on the same ground as it did 
previously, or that the claim should not be impaired. Under the 
Confederation, there were means of settling the old paper money, 
either in Congress or in the State legislatures. The money had at 
last depreciated to a thousand for one. The intention of State 
speculation, as well as individual speculation, was to get as much 



422 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

as possible of that money, in order to recover its nominal value. 
The means, says he, of settling this money, were in the hands of 
the old Congress. They could discharge it at its depreciated value. 
Is there that means here ? No, sir, we must pay it shilling for 
shilling or at least at the rate of one for forty. The amount will 
surpass the value of the property of the United States. Neither 
the State legislatures nor Congress can make an ex post facto law. 
The nominal value must therefore be paid. Where is the power 
in the new government to settle this money so as to prevent the 
country from being ruined ? When they prohibit the making ex post 
facto laws, they will have no authority to prevent our being ruined 
by paying that money at its nominal value. 

Without some security against it, we shall be compelled to pay 
it, to the last particle of our property. Shall we ruin our people 
by taxation, from generation to generation, to pay that money ? 
Should any ex post facto law be made to relieve us from such pay 
ments, it would not be regarded, because ex post facto laws are 
interdicted in the Constitution. We may be taxed for centuries, 
to give advantage to a few particular States in the Union, and a 
number of rapacious speculators. If there be any real security 
against this misfortune, let gentlemen show it. I can see none. 
The clause under consideration does away the pretended secu 
rity in the clause which was adduced by the honorable gentleman 
[Mr. Madison\. This enormous mass of worthless paper, which 
has been offered at a thousand for one, must be paid in actual 
gold and silver at the nominal value. 

[The subject continued.] 

Mr. George Mason. Mr. Chairman, the debt is transferred to 
Congress, but not the means of paying it. They cannot pay it in 
any other way than according to the nominal value ; for they are 
prohibited from making ex post facto laws ; and it would be ex 
post facto , to all intents and purposes, to pay off creditors with less 
than the nominal sum which they were originally promised. But 
the honorable gentleman [E. RandolpJi\ has called to his aid 
technical definitions. He says, that ex post facto \xw$&gt; relate solely 
to criminal matters. I beg leave to differ from him. Whatever 
it may be at the bar, or in a professional line, I conceive that, 
according to the common acceptation of the words, ex post facto 
laws and retrospective laws are synonymous terms. Are we to 



APPENDIX. 423 



trust business of this sort to technical definition ? The contrary 
is the plain meaning of the words. Congress has no power to 
scale this money. The States are equally precluded. The debt 
is transferred without the means of discharging it. Implication 
will not do. The means of paying it are expressly withheld. 
When this matter comes before the federal judiciary, they must 
determine according to this Constitution. It says expressly, that 
they shall not make ex post facto laws. Whatever may be the pro 
fessional meaning, yet the general meaning of ex post facto law is 
an act having a retrospective operation. This construction is 
agreeable to its primary etymology. Will it not be the duty of 
the federal court to say, that such laws are prohibited ? This goes 
to the destruction and annihilation of all the citizens of the 
United States, to enrich a few. Are we to part with every shilling 
of our property, and be reduced to the lowest insignificancy, to 
aggrandize a few speculators ? Let me mention a remarkable 
effect this Constitution will have. How stood our taxes before 
this Constitution was introduced ? Requisitions were made on 
the State legislatures, and, if they were unjust, they could be 
refused. If we were called upon to pay twenty millions, shilling 
for shilling, or at the rate of one for forty, our legislature could 
refuse it, and remonstrate against the injustice of the demand. 
But now this could not be done ; for direct taxation is brought 
home to us. The federal officer collects immediately of the 
planters. When it withholds the only possible means of dischar 
ging those debts, and by direct taxation prevents any opposition to 
the most enormous and unjust demand, where are you ? Is there 
a ray of hope ? As the law has never been my profession, if I 
err, I hope to be excused. 1 spoke from the general sense of the 
words. The worthy gentleman has told you that the United 
States can be plaintiffs, but never defendants. If so, it stands on 
very unjust grounds. The United States cannot be come at for 
any thing they may owe, but may get what is due to them. There 
is therefore no reciprocity. The thing is so incomprehensible 
that it cannot be explained. As an express power is given to the 
federal court to take cognizance of such controversies, and to 
declare null all ex post facto laws, I think gentlemen must see 
there is danger, and that it ought to be guarded against. 
[In answer to Mr. Madison :] 



424 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

Mr. Mason was still convinced of the rectitude of his former 
opinion. He thought it might be put on a safer footing by three 
words. By continuing the restriction of ex post facto laws to 
crimes, it would then stand under the new government as it did 
under the old. 

[2d clause, icth section.] 

Mr. George Mason. Mr. Chairman, if gentlemen attend to 
this clause, they will see we cannot make any inspection law but 
what is subject to the control and revision of Congress. Hence 
gentlemen who know nothing of the business will make rules con 
cerning it which may be detrimental to our interests. For forty 
years we have laid duties on tobacco, to defray the expenses of 
the inspection, and to raise an incidental revenue for the State. 
Under this clause, that incidental revenue which is calculated to 
pay for the inspection, and to defray contingent charges, is to be 
put into the federal treasury. But if any tobacco-house is burnt, 
we cannot make up the loss. I conceive this to be unjust and 
unreasonable. When any profit arises from it, it goes into the 
federal treasury. But when there is any loss or deficiency from 
damage, it cannot be made up. Congress are to make regulations 
for our tobacco. Are men, in the States where no tobacco is 
made, proper judges of this business ? They may perhaps judge 
as well, but surely no better than our own immediate legislature, 
who are accustomed and familiar with this business. This is one 
of the most wanton powers of the general government. I would 
concede any power that was essentially necessary for the interests 
of the Union ; but this, instead of being necessary, will be 
extremely oppressive. 

[In response to Mr. George Nicholas :] 

Mr. George Mason replied, that the State legislatures could 
make no law but what would come within the general control 
given to Congress ; and that the regulation of the inspection, and 
the imposition of duties, must be inseparably blended together. 

[The ist section of Article II.] 

Mr. George Mason. Mr. Chairman, there is not a more impor 
tant article in the Constitution than this. The great fundamental 
principle of responsibility in republicanism is here sapped. The 
President is elected without rotation. It may be said that a new 
election may remove him, and place another in his stead. If we 



A PPENDIX. 42 5 



judge from the experience of all other countries, and even our 
own, we may conclude that, as the President of the United States 
may be reflected, so he will. How is it in every government 
where rotation is not required ? Is there a single instance of a 
great man not being reflected ? Our governor is obliged to 
return, after a given period, to a private station. It is so in most 
of the States. This President will be elected time after time : he 
will be continued in office for life. If we wish to change him, 
the great powers in Europe will not allow us. The honorable 
gentleman, my colleague in the late federal Convention \E. Ran- 
dolpti\) mentions with applause, those parts of which he had 
expressed his disapprobation. 1 He says not a word. If I am 
mistaken, let me be put right. I shall not make use of his name ; 
but, in the course of this investigation I shall use the arguments 
of that gentleman against it. 

Will not the great powers of Europe, as France and Great 
Britain, be interested in having a friend in the President of the 
United States ? And will they not be more interested in his elec 
tion than in that of the King of Poland ? The people of Poland 
have a right to displace their King. But do they ever do it ? No. 
Prussia and Russia, and other European powers, would not suffer 
it. This clause will open a door to the dangers and misfortunes 
which the people of Poland undergo. The powers of Europe will 
interpose, and we shall have a civil war in the bowels of our 
country, and be subject to all the horrors and calamities of an 
elective monarchy. This very executive officer may, by consent 
of Congress, receive a stated pension from European potentates. 
This is not an idea altogether new in America. It is not many 
years ago since the revolution that a foreign power offered 
emoluments to persons holding offices under our government. 
It will, moreover, be difficult to know whether he receives emolu 
ments from foreign powers or not. The electors, who are to meet 
in each State to vote for him, may be easily influenced. To pre 
vent the certain evils of attempting to elect a new President, it 
will be necessary to continue the old one. The only way to alter 
this would be to render him ineligible after a certain number of 
years, and then no foreign nation would interfere to keep in a 

1 The punctuation has been altered here, as otherwise the sentence is unintel 
ligible. 



426 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

man who was utterly ineligible. Nothing is so essential to the 
preservation of a republican government as a periodical rotation. 
Nothing so strongly impels a man to regard the interest of his 
constituents as the certainty of returning to the general mass of 
the people, from whence he was taken, where he must participate 
their burdens. It is a great defect in the Senate that they are not 
ineligible at the end of six years. The biennial exclusion of one 
third of them will have no effect, as they can be reflected. Some 
stated time ought to be fixed when the President ought to be 
reduced to a private station. I should be contented that he might 
be elected for eight years ; but I would wish him to be capable of 
holding the office only eight years out of twelve or sixteen years. 
But, as it now stands, he may continue in office for life ; or, in 
other words, it will be an elective monarchy. 

Mr. George Mason. Mr. Chairman, the Vice-President ap 
pears to me to be not only an unnecessary but dangerous officer. 
He is, contrary to the usual course of parliamentary proceedings, 
to be president of the Senate. The State from which he comes 
may have two votes, when the others will have but one. Besides 
the legislative and executive are hereby mixed and incorporated 
together. I cannot, at this distance of time, foresee the conse 
quences ; but I think that, in the course of human affairs, he 
will be made a tool of in order to bring about his own interest, 
and aid in overturning the liberties of his country. There is 
another part which I disapprove of, but which perhaps I do not 
understand. " In case of removal of the President from office, or 
of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and 
duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the Vice-Presi 
dent ; and the Congress may by law provide for the case of 
removal, death, resignation, or inability, both of the President 
and Vice-President, declaring what officer shall then act as Presi 
dent, and such officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be 
removed or a President shall be elected." The power of Congress 
is right and proper so far as it enables them to provide what offi 
cer shall act, in case both the President and Vice-President be 
dead or disabled. But gentlemen ought to take notice that the 
election of this officer is only for four years. There is no provi 
sion for a speedy election of another President, when the former 
is dead or removed. The influence of the Vice-President may 



APPENDIX. 427 



prevent the election of the President. But perhaps I may be 
mistaken. 

Wednesday, June 18. [The ist section of Article II. still under 
consideration.] 

Mr. George Mason contended that this mode of election was a 
mere deception, a mere ignis fatuus on the American people, 
and thrown out to make them believe they were to choose him ; 
whereas it would not be once out of fifty times that he would be 
chosen by them in the first instance, because a majority of the 
whole number of votes was required. If the localities of the States 
were considered, and the probable diversity of the opinions of the 
people attended to, he thought it would be found that so many 
persons would be voted for, that there seldom or never could be a 
majority in favor of one, except one great name who, he believed, 
would be unanimously elected. He then continued thus : A 
majority of the whole number of electors is necessary, to elect the 
President. It is not the greatest number of votes that is required, 
but a majority of the whole number of electors. If there be more 
than one having such majority, and an equal number, one of them 
is to be chosen by ballot of the House of Representatives. But if 
no one have a majority of the actual number of electors appointed, 
how is he to be chosen ? From the five highest in the list, by bal 
lot of the lower house, and the votes to be taken by States. I 
conceive he ought to be chosen from the two highest on the list. 
This would be simple and easy ; then, indeed, the people would 
have some agency in the election. But when it is extended to the 
five highest, a person having a very small number of votes may be 
elected. This will almost constantly happen. The States may 
choose the man in whom they have most confidence. This, in my 
opinion, is a very considerable defect. The people will, in reality, 
have no hand in the election. It has been wittily observed that 
the Constitution has married the President and Senate has made 
them man and wife. I believe the consequence that generally 
results from marriage will happen here. They will be continually 
supporting and aiding each other : they will always consider their 
interest as united. We know the advantage the few have over 
the many. They can with facility act in concert and on a uniform 
system : they may join, scheme, and plot, against the people with 
out any chance of detection. The Senate and President will form 



428 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

a combination that cannot be prevented by the representatives. 
The executive and legislative powers, thus connected, will destroy 
all balances : this would have been prevented by a constitutional 
council, to aid the President in the discharge of his office, vesting 
the Senate, at the same time, with the power of impeaching them. 
Then we should have real responsibility. In its present form, the 
guilty try themselves. The President is tried by his counsellors. 
He is not removed from office during his trial. When he is 
arraigned for treason, he has the command of the army and navy, 
and may surround the Senate with thirty thousand troops. It 
brings to my recollection the remarkable trial of Milo at Rome. 
We may expect to see similar instances here. But I suppose 
that the cure for all evils the virtue and integrity of our repre 
sentatives will be thought a sufficient security. On this great 
and important subject, I am one of those (and ever shall be) who 
object to it. 

[In reply to Mr. Madison :] 

Mr. Mason arose, and insisted that the person having the great 
est number of votes would not be elected unless such majority was 
one of the whole number of electors appointed ; that it would 
rarely happen that any one would have such a majority, and as he 
was then to be chosen from the five highest on the list, his election 
was entirely taken from the people. 

[ist clause, section 2d, Article II.] 

Mr. George Mason, animadverting on the magnitude of the 
powers of the President, was alarmed at the additional power 
of commanding the army in person. He admitted the pro 
priety of his being commander-in-chief, so far as to give orders 
and have a general superintendency ; but he thought it would be 
dangerous to let him command in person, without any restraint, as 
he might make a bad use of it. He was, then, clearly of opinion 
that the consent of a majority of both houses of Congress should 
be required before he could take the command in person. If at 
any time it should be necessary that he should take the personal 
command, either on account of his superior abilities or other 
cause, then Congress would agree to it ; and all dangers would be 
obviated by requiring their consent. He called to gentlemen s 
recollection the extent of what the late commander-in-chief might 
have done, from his great abilities, and the strong attachment of 



APPENDIX. 429 



both officers and soldiers towards him, if, instead of being disin 
terested, he had been an ambitious man. So disinterested and 
amiable a character as General Washington might never command 
again. The possibility of danger ought to be guarded against. 
Although he did not disapprove of the President s consultation 
with the principal executive officers, yet he objected to the want 
of an executive council, which he conceived to be necessary to any 
regular free government. There being none such, he apprehended 
a council would arise out of the Senate, which, for want of real 
responsibility, he thought dangerous. You will please, says he, to 
recollect that removal from office, and future disqualification to 
hold any office, are the only consequences of conviction on im 
peachment. Now, I conceive that the President ought not to have 
the power of pardoning, because he may frequently pardon crimes 
which were advised by himself. It may happen, at some future 
day, that he will establish a monarchy, and destroy the republic. 
If he has the power of granting pardons before indictment, or 
conviction, may he not stop inquiry and prevent detection ? The 
case of treason ought, at least, to be excepted. This is a weighty 
objection with me. 

[In answer to Mr. Lee :] 

Mr. Mason replied, that he did not mean that the President was 
of necessity to command, but he might if he pleased ; and if he 
was an ambitious man, he might make a dangerous use of it. 

[In reply to Mr. George Nicholas :] 

Mr. Mason answered, that it did not resemble the State Consti 
tution, because the governor did not possess such extensive powers 
as the President, and had no influence over the navy. The liberty 
of the people had been destroyed by those who were military 
commanders only. The danger here was greater by the junction 
of great civil powers to the command of the army and fleet. Al 
though Congress are to raise the army, said he, no security arises 
from that ; for, in time of war, they must and ought to raise an 
army, which will be numerous, or otherwise, according to the 
nature of the war, and then the President is to command without 
any control. 

[In reply to Mr. Madison :] 

Mr. Mason vindicated the conduct of the assemblies [in Massa 
chusetts] mentioned by the gentleman last up. He insisted they 



430 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

were both right ; for, in the first instance, when such ideas of 
severity prevailed, a rebellion was in existence : [Shay s rebellion] 
in such circumstance, it was right to be rigid. But after it was 
over, it would be wrong to exercise unnecessary severity. 

[26. clause, 2d section, Article II.] 

Mr. George Mason thought this a most dangerous clause, as 
thereby five States might make a treaty ; ten senators the repre 
sentatives of five States being two thirds of a quorum. These 
ten might come from the five smallest States. By the Con 
federation, nine States were necessary to concur in a treaty. This 
secured justice and moderation. His principal fear, however, was 
not that five, but that seven, States a bare majority would make 
treaties to bind the Union. 

[Mr. George Nicholas answered Mr. Mason.] 

Mr. Mason differed widely from the gentleman. He conceived 
that the contiguity of some States, and remoteness of others, 
would prevent that reciprocity which he had mentioned. Some 
States were near the seat of government ; others far from it ; for 
instance, Georgia was eight or nine hundred miles from it. Sup 
pose, says he, a partial treaty is made by the President, and is to 
be ratified by the Senate. They do not always sit. Who is to 
convene them ? The President. Is it presumable that he would 
call distant States to make the ratification, or those States whose 
interest he knew to be injured by the treaty he had proposed ? 
This, I conceive, will have a contrary effect from w r hat the gentle 
man says. 

Thursday, June ip. [The subject of treaties continued.] 

Mr. George Mason. Mr. Chairman, it is true that this is one of 
the greatest acts of sovereignty, and therefore ought to be most 
strongly guarded. The cession of such a power, without such 
checks and guards, cannot be justified ; yet I acknowledge such a 
power must rest somewhere. It is so in all governments. If, in 
the course of an unsuccessful war, we should be compelled to 
give up part of our territories, or undergo subjugation if the gen 
eral government could not make a treaty to give up such a part 
for the preservation of the residue, the government itself, and 
consequently the rights of the people, must fall. Such a power 
must, therefore, rest somewhere. For my own part, I never heard 
it denied that such a power must be vested in the government. 



APPENDIX. 431 



Our complaint is, that it is not sufficiently guarded, and that it 
requires much more solemnity and caution than are delineated in 
that system. It is more guarded in England. Will any gentle 
man undertake to say that the King, by his prerogative, can dis 
member the British empire ? Could the King give Portsmouth to 
France ? He could not do this without an express act of Parlia 
ment without the consent of the legislature in all its branches. 
There are other things which the King cannot do, which may be 
done by the President and Senate in this case. Could the King, 
by his prerogative, enable foreign subjects to purchase lands, and 
have an hereditary indefeasible title ? This would require an ex 
press act of Parliament. Though the King can make treaties, yet 
he cannot make a treaty contrary to the constitution of his coun 
try. Where did their constitution originate ? It is founded on a 
number of maxims, which, by long time, are rendered sacred and 
inviolable. Where are there such maxims in the American Con 
stitution ? In that country, which we formerly called our mother 
country, they have had for many centuries, certain fundamental 
maxims, which have secured their persons and properties, and 
prevented a dismemberment of their country. The common law, 
sir, has prevented the power of the crown from destroying the 
immunities of the people. We are placed in a still better condi 
tion in a more favorable situation than perhaps any people 
ever were before. We have it in our power to secure our liberties 
and happiness on the most unshaken, firm, and permanent basis. 
We can establish what government we please. But by that paper 
we are consolidating the United States into one great government, 
and trusting to constructive security. You will find no such 
thing in the English government. The common law of England 
is not the common law of these States. I conceive, therefore, 
that there is nothing in that Constitution to hinder a dismember 
ment of the empire. 

Will any gentleman say that they may not make a treaty, where 
by the subjects of France, England, and other powers, may buy 
what lands they please in this country ? This would violate those 
principles which we have received from the mother country. The 
indiscriminate admission of all foreigners to the first rights of 
citizenship, without any permanent security for their attachment 
to the country, is repugnant to every principle of prudence and 



432 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

good policy. The President and Senate can make any treaty 
whatsoever. We wish not to refuse, but to guard, this power, as 
it is done in England. The empire there cannot be dismembered 
without the consent of the national Parliament. We wish an ex 
press and explicit declaration, in that paper, that the power which 
can make other treaties cannot, without the consent of the national 
Parliament the national legislature dismember the empire. The 
Senate alone ought not to have this power ; much less ought a few 
States to have it. No treaty to dismember the empire ought to be 
made without the consent of three fourths of the legislature in all 
its branches. Nor ought such a treaty to be made but in case of 
the most urgent and unavoidable necessity. When such necessity 
exists, there is no doubt but there will be a general and uniform 
vote of the Continental Parliament. 

[ist and 2d sections of Article III. The Judiciary.] 
Mr. George Mason. Mr. Chairman, I had some hopes that the 
candor and reason of the warmest friends of this Constitution 
would have led them to point out objections so important. They 
must occur, more or less, to the mind of every one. It is with 
great reluctance I speak of this department, as it lies out of my 
line. I should not tell my sentiments upon it, did I not conceive 
it to be so constructed as to destroy the dearest rights of the 
community. After having read the first section, Mr. Mason 
asked, what is there left to the State courts ? Will any gentle 
man be pleased, candidly, fairly, and without sophistry, to show 
us what remains ? There is no limitation. It goes to every thing. 
The inferior courts are to be as numerous as Congress may 
think proper. They are to be of whatever nature they please. 
Read the 26. section, and contemplate attentively the extent of 
the jurisdiction of these courts, and consider if there be any 
limits to it. 

I am greatly mistaken if there be any limitation whatsoever, 
with respect to the nature or jurisdiction of these courts. If there 
be any limits, they must be contained in one of the clauses of this 
section ; and I believe, on a dispassionate discussion, it will be 
found that there is none of any check. All the laws of the United 
States are paramount to the laws and Constitution of any single 
State. " The judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and 
equity arising under this Constitution." What objects will not 



APPENDIX. 433 



this expression extend to ? Such laws may be formed as will go 
to every object of private property. When we consider the nature 
of these courts, we must conclude that their effect and operation 
will be utterly to destroy the State governments ; for they will be 
the judges how far their laws will operate. They are to modify 
their own courts, and you can make no State law to counteract 
them. The discrimination between their judicial power, and that 
of the States, exists, therefore, but in name. To what disgraceful 
and dangerous length does the principle of this go ! For if your 
State judiciaries are not to be trusted with the administration of 
common justice, and decision of disputes respecting property be 
tween man and man, much less ought the State governments to be 
trusted with power of legislation. The principle itself goes to 
the destruction of the legislation of the States, whether or not it 
was intended. As to my own opinion, I most religiously and con 
scientiously believe that it was intended, though I am not abso 
lutely certain. But I think it will destroy the State governments, 
whatever may have been the intention. There are many gentle 
men in the United States who think it right that we should have 
one great national, consolidated government, and that it was better 
to bring it about slowly and imperceptibly rather than all at once. 
This is no reflection on any man, for I mean none. To those who 
think that one national, consolidated government is best for Amer 
ica, this extensive judicial authority will be agreeable ; but I hope 
there are many in this Convention of a different opinion, and who 
see their political happiness resting on their State governments. I 
know, from my own knowledge, many worthy gentlemen of the 
former opinion. 

[Here Mr. Madison interrupted Mr. Mason, and demanded an 
unequivocal explanation. As these insinuations might create a 
belief that every member of the late federal Convention was of 
that opinion, he wished him to tell who the gentlemen were to 
whom he alluded.] 

Mr. Mason then replied, I shall never refuse to explain myself. 
It is notorious that this is a prevailing principle. It was at least 
the opinion of many gentlemen in Convention, and many in the 
United States. I do not know what explanation the honorable 
gentleman asks. I can say, with great truth, that the honorable 
gentleman, in private conversation with me, expressed himself 

VOL. II. 28 



434 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

against it ; neither did I ever hear any of the delegates from this 
State advocate it. 

Mr. Madison declared himself satisfied with this, unless the 
committee thought themselves entitled to ask a further ex 
planation. 

After some desultory remarks, Mr. Mason continued : 1 have 
heard that opinion advocated by gentlemen for whose abilities, 
judgment, and knowledge, I have the highest reverence and re 
spect. I say that the general description of the judiciary involves 
the most extensive jurisdiction. Its cognizance, in all cases 
arising under the system and the laws of Congress, may be said to 
be unlimited. In the next place, it extends to treaties made, or 
which shall be made, under their authority. This is one of the 
powers which ought to be given them. I also admit that they 
ought to have judicial cognizance in all cases affecting ambassa 
dors, foreign ministers and consuls, as well as in cases of maritime 
jurisdiction. There is an additional reason now to give them this 
last power ; because Congress, besides the general powers, are 
about to get that of regulating commerce with foreign nations. 
This is a power which existed before, and is a proper subject of 
federal jurisdiction. The next power of the judiciary is also 
necessary under some restrictions. Though the decision of con 
troversies to which the United States shall be a party may at first 
view seem proper, it may, without restraint, be extended to a dan 
gerously oppressive length. The next with respect to disputes 
between two or more States, is right. I cannot see the propriety 
of the next power, in disputes between a State and the citizens of 
another State. As to controversies between citizens of different 
States, their power is improper and inadmissible. In disputes 
between citizens of the same State, claiming lands under the grants 
of different States, the power is proper. It is the only case in 
which the federal judiciary ought to have appellate cognizance of 
disputes between private citizens. Unless this was the case, the 
suit must be brought and decided in one or the other State, under 
whose grant the lands are claimed, which would be injurious, as 
the decision must be consistent with the grant. 

The last clause is still more improper. To give them cognizance 
in disputes between a State and the citizens thereof, is utterly in 
consistent with reason or good policy. 



APPENDIX. 435 



Here Mr. Nicholas arose, and informed Mr. Mason that his 
interpretation of this part was not warranted by the words. 

Mr. Mason replied, that, if he recollected rightly, the propriety 
of the power, as explained by him, had been contended for; but that, 
as his memory had never been good, and was now impaired much 
from his age, he would not insist on that interpretation. He then 
proceeded : Give me leave to advert to the operation of this ju 
dicial power. Its jurisdiction in the first case will extend to all 
cases affecting revenue, excise, and custom-house officers. If I am 
mistaken, I will retract. " All cases in law and equity arising under 
this Constitution, and the laws of the United States," take in all 
the officers of the government. They comprehend all those who act 
as collectors of taxes, excisemen, &c. It will take in, of course, 
what others do to them, and what is done by them to others. In 
\vhat predicament will our citizens then be ? We know the diffi 
culty we are put in by our own courts, and how hard it is to bring 
officers to justice even in them. If any of the federal officers 
should be guilty of the greatest oppressions, or behave with the 
most insolent and wanton brutality to a man s wife or daughter, 
where is this man to get relief ? If you suppose in the inferior 
courts, they are not appointed by the States. They are not men 
in whom the community can place confidence. It will be decided 
by federal judges. Even suppose the poor man should be able to 
obtain judgment in the inferior court, for the greatest injury, 
what justice can he get on appeal ? Can he go four or five hun 
dred miles ? Can he stand the expense attending it ? On this 
occasion they are to judge of fact as well as law. He must bring 
his witnesses where he is not known, where new evidence may be 
brought against him, of which he never heard before, and which 
he cannot contradict. 

The honorable gentleman who presides here has told us that 
the Supreme Court of appeals must embrace every object of mari 
time, chancery, and common-law controversy. In the two first, 
the appellate jurisdiction as to fact must be generally granted ; 
because, otherwise, it could exclude appeals in those cases. But 
why not discriminate as to matters of fact with respect to 
common-law controversies ? The honorable gentleman has allowed 
that it was dangerous, but hopes regulations will be made to suit 
the convenience of the people. But mere hope is not a sufficient 



436 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 



security. I have said that it appears to me (though I am no 
lawyer) to be very dangerous. Give me leave to lay before the 
committee an amendment, which I think convenient, easy, and 
proper. 

[Here Mr. Mason proposed an alteration neariy the same as 
the first part of the fourteenth amendment recommended by the 
Convention.] 

Thus, sir, said Mr. Mason, after limiting the cases in which the 
federal judiciary could interpose, I would confine the appellate 
jurisdiction to matters of law only, in common-law controversies. 
It appears to me that this will remove oppressions and answer every 
purpose of an appellate power. A discrimination arises between 
common-law trials and trials in courts of equity and admiralty. In 
these two last, depositions are committed to record, and therefore, 
on an appeal, the whole fact goes up ; the equity of the whole case, 
comprehending fact and law, is considered, and no new evidence 
requisite. Is it so in courts of common law ? There evidence is only 
given viva voce. I know not a single case where there is an appeal of 
fact as to common law. But I may be mistaken. Where there is an 
appeal from an inferior to a superior court, with respect to matters 
of fact, a new witness may be introduced, who is perhaps suborned 
by the other party, a thousand miles from the place where the 
first trial was had. These are some of the inconveniences and 
insurmountable objections against this general power being given 
to the federal courts. Gentlemen will perhaps say there will be 
no occasion to carry up the evidence by viva voce testimony, because 
Congress may order it to be committed to writing, and trans 
mitted in that manner with the rest of the record. It is true they 
may, but it is as true that they may not. But suppose they do ; 
little conversant as I am in this subject, I know there is a great 
difference between viva voce evidence given at the bar, and testi 
mony given in writing. I leave it to gentlemen more conversant 
in these matters to discuss it. They are also to have cognizance 
in controversies to which the United States shall be a party. This 
power is superadded, that there might be no doubt, and that all 
cases arising under the government might be brought before the 
federal court. Gentlemen will not, I presume, deny that all 
revenue and excise controversies, and all proceedings relative 
to the duties of the officers of government, from the highest to 



APPENDIX. 437 



the lowest, may and must be brought by these means to the 
federal courts ; in the first instance, to the inferior federal court, 
and afterwards to the superior court. Every fact proved with 
respect to these, in the court below, may be revived in the 
superior court. But this appellate jurisdiction is to be under the 
regulations of Congress. What these regulations may be, God 
only knows. 

Their jurisdiction further extends to controversies between 
citizens of different States. Can we not trust our State courts 
with the decision of these ? If I have a controversy with a man 
in Maryland, if a man in Maryland has my bond for a hundred 
pounds, are not the State courts competent to try it ? Is it 
suspected that they would enforce the payment if unjust, or 
refuse to enforce it if just ? The very idea is ridiculous. What ! 
carry me a thousand miles from home from my family and 
business to where, perhaps, it will be impossible for me to prove 
that I paid it ? Perhaps I have a respectable witness who saw me 
pay the money ; but I must carry him one thousand miles to 
prove it, or be compelled to pay it again. Is there any necessity 
for this power ? It ought to have no unnecessary or dangerous 
power. Why should the federal courts have this cognizance ? Is 
it because one lives on one side of the Potomac, and the other on 
the other ? Suppose I have your bond for a thousand pounds : 
if I have any wish to harass you, or if I be of a litigious disposi 
tion, I have only to assign it to a gentleman in Maryland ? This 
assignment will involve you in trouble and expense. What effect 
will this power have between British creditors and the citizens of 
this State ? This is a ground on which I shall speak with confi 
dence. Every one who heard me speak on the subject, knows 
that I always spoke for the payment of the British debts. I wish 
every honest debt to be paid. Though I would wish to pay the 
British creditor, yet I would not put it in his power to gratify 
private malice to our injury. Let me be put right if I be mis 
taken ; but there is not, in my opinion, a single British creditor 
but can bring his debtors to the federal court. 

There are a thousand instances where debts have been paid, and 
yet must, by this appellate cognizance, be paid again. Are these 
imaginary cases ? Are they only possible cases, or are they certain 
and inevitable ? " To controversies between a State and the 



438 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

citizens of another State." How will their jurisdiction in this 
case do ? Let gentlemen look at the westward. Claims respect 
ing those lands, every liquidated account, or other claim against 
this State, will be tried before the federal court. Is not this dis 
graceful ? Is this State to be brought to the bar of justice like a 
delinquent individual ? Is the sovereignty of the State to be 
arraigned like a culprit, or private offender ? Will the States 
undergo this mortification ? I think this power perfectly unneces 
sary. But let us pursue this subject farther. What is to be done 
if a judgment be obtained against a State ? Will you issue a 
fieri facias ? It would be ludicrous to say that you could put the 
State s body in jail. How is the judgment, then, to be enforced ? 
A power which cannot be executed ought not to be granted. 

Let us consider the operation of the last subject of its cognizance. 
" Controversies between a State, or the citizens thereof, and 
foreign States, citizens, or subjects." There is a confusion in 
this case. This much, however, may be raised out of it that a 
suit will be brought against Virginia. She may be sued by a 
foreign State. W T hat reciprocity is there in it ? In a suit bet\veen 
Virginia and a foreign State, is the foreign State to be bound by 
the decision ? Is there a similar privilege given to us in foreign 
States ? Where will you find a parallel regulation ? How will 
the decision be enforced ? Only by the ultima ratio regum. A 
dispute between a foreign citizen or subject and a Virginian can 
not be tried in our own courts, but must be decided in the federal 
court. Is this the case in any other country ? Are not men 
obliged to stand by the laws of the country where the disputes 
are ? This is an innovation which is utterly unprecedented and 
unheard-of. Cannot we trust the State courts with disputes 
between a Frenchman, or an Englishman, and a citizen ; or with 
disputes between two Frenchmen ? This is disgraceful ; it will 
annihilate your State judiciary ; it will prostrate your legislature. 

Thus, sir, it appears to me that the greater part of these powers 
are unnecessary, and dangerous, as tending to impair, and ulti 
mately destroy, the State judiciaries, and, by the same principle, 
the legislation of the State governments. To render it safe, there 
must be an amendment, such as I have pointed out. After men 
tioning the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, which 
extends to but three cases, it gives it appellate jurisdiction, in all 



APPENDIX. 439 



other cases mentioned, both as to law and fact, indiscriminately 
and without limitation. Why not remove the cause of fear and 
danger ? But it is said that the regulations of Congress will 
remove these. I say that, in my opinion, they will have a con 
trary effect, and will utterly annihilate your State courts. Who 
are the court ? The judges. It is a familiar distinction. We 
frequently speak of a court in contradistinction from a jury. I 
think the court are to be judges of this. The judges on the 
bench are to be judges of fact and law, with such exceptions, &c., 
as Congress shall make. Now give me leave to ask, Is not a jury 
excluded absolutely ? By way of illustration, were Congress to 
say that a jury, instead of a court, should judge the fact, will not 
the court be still judges of the fact consistently with this Constitu 
tion ? Congress may make such a regulation, or may not. But 
suppose they do ; what sort of a jury would they have in the ten 
miles square ? I would rather a thousand times, be tried by a 
court than by such a jury. This great palladium of national 
safety, which is secured to us by our own government, will be 
taken from us in those courts ; or, if it be reserved, it will be but 
in name, and not in substance. In the government of Virginia, 
we have secured an impartial jury of the vicinage. We can 
except to jurors, and peremptorily challenge them in criminal 
trials. If I be tried in the federal court for a crime which may 
affect my life, have I a right of challenging or excepting to the 
jury ? Have not the best men suffered by weak and partial juries ? 
This sacred right ought, therefore, to be secured. 

I dread the ruin that will be brought on thirty thousand of our 
people, with respect to disputed lands. I am personally endangered 
as an inhabitant of the Northern Neck. The people of that part 
will be obliged, by the operation of this power, to pay the quitrents 
of their lands. Whatever other gentleman may think, I consider 
this as a most serious alarm. It will little avail a man to make a 
profession of his candor. It is to his character and reputation 
they will appeal. Let gentlemen consider my public and private 
character. To these I wish gentlemen to appeal for an interpre 
tation of my motives and views. Lord Fairfax s title was clear 
and undisputed. After the revolution, we taxed his lands as 
private property. After his death, an act of Assembly was made, 
in 1782, to sequester the quitrents due, at his death, in the hands 



440 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

of his debtors. Next year an act was made restoring them to the 
executor of the proprietor. Subsequent to this, the treaty of 
peace was made, by which it was agreed that there should be no 
further confiscations. But, after this, an act of Assembly passed, 
confiscating his whole property. As Lord Fairfax s title was indis 
putably good, and as treaties are to be the supreme law of the 
land, will not his representatives be able to recover all in the 
federal court ? How will gentlemen like to pay an additional tax 
on lands in the Northern Neck ? This the operation of this 
system will compel them to do. They now are subject to the 
same tax that other citizens are ; and if the quitrents be recovered 
in the federal court, they are doubly taxed. This may be called 
an assertion ; but, were I going to my grave, I would appeal to 
Heaven that I think it true. How will a poor man, who is injured 
or dispossessed unjustly, get a remedy ? Is he to go to the federal 
court, seven or eight hundred miles? He might as well give his 
claim up. He may grumble, but, finding no relief, he will be con 
tented. 

Again, all that tract of country between the Blue ridge and the 
Alleghany Mountains will be claimed, and probably recovered in 
the federal court, from the present possessors, by those companies 
who have a title to them. These lands have been sold to a great 
number of people. Many settled on them, on terms which were 
advertised. How will this be with respect to ex post facto laws ? 
We have not only confirmed the title of those who made the con 
tract, but those who did not, by a law, in 1779, on their paying the 
original price. Much was paid in a depreciated value, and much 
was not paid at all. Again, the great Indiana purchase, which 
was made to the westward, will, by this judicial power, be rendered 
a cause of dispute. The possessors may be ejected from those 
lands. That company paid a consideration of ten thousand pounds 
to the crown, before the lands were taken up. I have heard 
gentlemen of the law say (and I believe it is right) that, after the 
consideration was paid to the crown, the purchase was legally 
made, and ought to be valid. That company may come in, and 
show that they have paid the money, and have a full right to the 
land. Of the Indiana company I need not say much. It is well 
known that their claims will be brought before these courts. 
Three or four counties are settled on the land to which that com- 



APPENDIX. 441 



pany claims a title, and have long enjoyed it peaceably. All these 
claims before those courts, if they succeed, will introduce a scene 
of distress and confusion never heard of before. Our peasants 
will be, like those mentioned by Virgil, reduced to ruin and 
misery, driven from their farms, and obliged to leave their 
country : " Nos patriam fugimus et dulcia linqiiimus arva" 

Having mentioned these things, give me leave to submit an 
amendment, which I think would be proper and safe, and would 
render our citizens secure in their possessions justly held. I mean, 
sir, " that the judicial power shall extend to no case where the 
cause of action shall have originated before the ratification of this 
Constitution, except in suits for debts due to the United States, 
disputes between States about their territory, and disputes between 
persons claiming lands under the grants of different States." In 
these cases, there is an obvious necessity for giving it a retrospec 
tive power. I have laid before you my idea on the subject, and 
expressed my fears, which I most conscientiously believe to be well 
founded. 

Friday, June 20. [The ist and 2d sections of Article III. still 
under consideration.] 

Mr. George Mason. Mr. Chairman, the objection I made, 
respecting the assignment of a bond from a citizen of this State to 
a citizen of another State, remains still in force. The honorable 
gentleman [E. Pendleton\ has said that there can be no danger, in 
the first instance, because it is not within the original jurisdiction 
of the Supreme Court ; but that the suit must be brought in the 
inferior federal court of Virginia. He supposes there can never 
be an appeal in this case, by the plaintiff, because he gets a judg 
ment on his bond ; and that the defendant alone can appeal, who 
therefore, instead of being injured, obtains a privilege. Permit 
me to examine the force of this. By means of a suit, on a real or 
fictitious claim, the citizens of the most distant States may be 
brought to the supreme federal court. Suppose a man has my 
bond for a hundred pounds, and a great part of it has been paid, 
and, in order fraudulently to oppress me he assigns it to a gentle 
man in Carolina or Maryland. He then carries me to the inferior 
federal court. I produce my witness, and judgment is given in 
favor of the defendant. The plaintiff appeals, and carries me to 
the superior court, a thousand miles, and my expenses amount to 



442 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

more than the bond. The honorable gentleman recommends to 
me to alter my proposed amendment. I would as soon take the 
advice of that gentleman as any other ; but, though the regard 
which I have for him be great, I cannot assent on this great 
occasion. 

There are not many instances of decisions by juries in the 
admiralty or chancery ; because the facts are generally proved by 
depositions. When that is done, the fact, being ascertained, goes 
up to the superior court, as part of the record ; so that there will 
be no occasion to revise that part. 

Monday, June 23. [The ist and 2d sections of Article III. still 
under consideration. The speeches of this day incompletely 
reported.] 

Mr. George Mason. Mr. Chairman, I should not have troubled 
the committee again on this subject, were there not some arguments 
in support of that plan, sir, that appear to me totally unsatisfactory. 
With respect to concurrent jurisdiction, sir, the honorable gentleman 
[Mr. Madisoji\ has observed, that county courts had exercised 
this right without complaint. Have Hanover and Henrico the 
same objects? Can an officer in either of those counties serve a 
process in the other ? The federal judiciary has concurrent juris 
diction throughout the States, and therefore must interfere with 
the State judiciaries. Congress can pass a law constituting the 
powers of the federal judiciary throughout the States : they may 
also pass a law vesting the federal power in the State judiciaries, 
These laws are, permanent, and cannot be controverted by any law 
of the State. 

If we were forming a general government, and not States, I 
think we should perfectly comply with the genius of the paper 
before you ; but if we mean to form one great national govern 
ment for thirteen States, the arguments which I have heard 
hitherto in support of this part of the plan do not apply at all. We 
are willing to give up all powers which are necessary to preserve 
the peace of the Union, so far as respects foreign nations, or our 
own preservation ; but we will not agree to a federal judiciary, 
which is not necessary for this purpose, because the powers there 
granted will tend to oppress the middling and lower class of people. 
A poor man seized by the federal officers, and carried to the fed 
eral court, has he any chance under such a system as this? 



APPENDIX. 443 



Justice itself may be bought too dear ; yet this may be the case. 
It may cost a man five hundred pounds to recover one hundred 
pounds. These circumstances are too sacred to leave undefined ; 
and I wish to see things certain, positive, and clear. But, however, 
sir, these matters have been so fully investigated, that I beg pardon 
for having intruded so far, and I hope we shall go on in the 
business. 

[The ist section of Article IV. was then read.] 

Mr. George Mason. Mr. Chairman : the latter part of this 
clause, sir, I confess I do not understand Full faith and credit 
shall be given to all acts ; and how far it may be proper that Con 
gress shall declare the effects, I cannot clearly see into. 

[2d section, Article IV.] 

Mr. George Mason. Mr. Chairman, on some former part of 
the investigation of this subject, gentlemen were pleased to make 
some observations on the security of property coming within this 
section. It was then said, and I now say, that there is no security ; 
nor have gentlemen convinced me of this. 

[3d section, Article IV., was then read.] 

Mr. George Mason took a retrospective view of several parts 
which had been before objected to. He endeavored to demon 
strate the dangers that must inevitably arise from the insecurity of 
our rights and privileges, as they depended on vague, indefinite, 
and ambiguous implications. The adoption of a system so replete 
with defects, he appehended, could not but be productive of the 
most alarming consequences. He dreaded popular resistance to 
its operation. He expressed, in emphatic terms, the dreadful 
effects which must ensue, should the people resist ; and concluded 
by observing, that he trusted gentlemen would pause before they 
would decide a question which involved such awful consequences. 

Tuesday, June 24. [In answer to E. Randolph.] 

Mr. George Mason. Mr. Chairman, with respect to commerce 
and navigation, he has given it as his opinion that their regulation, 
as it now stands, was a sine qua non of the Union, and that without 
it the States in Convention would never concur. I differ from 
him. It never was, nor in my opinion ever will be, a sine qua non 
of the Union. 

I will give you, to the best of my recollection, the history 
of that affair. This business was discussed at Philadelphia for 



r

four months, during which time the subject of commerce and 
navigation was often under consideration ; and I assert that 
eight States out of twelve, for more than three months, 
voted for requiring two thirds of the members present in each 
house to pass commercial and navigation laws. True it is, that 
afterwards it was carried by a majority as it stands. If I am 
right, there was a great majority for requiring two thirds of the 
States in this business, till a compromise took place between the 
Northern and Southern States ; the Northern States agreeing to 
the temporary importation of slaves, and the Southern States con 
ceding, in return, that navigation and commercial laws should be 
on the footing on which they now stand. If I am mistaken, let me 
be put right. Those are my reasons for saying that this was not a 
sine qua non of their concurrence. The Newfoundland fisheries 
will require that kind of security which we are now in want of. 
The Eastern States therefore agreed, at length, that treaties 
should require the consent of two thirds of the members present 
in the Senate. 



IV. 

AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION. 

The bill of rights here given is from the original manuscript in 
the handwriting of George Mason. The amendments, twelve in 
number, seem to be also penned by him. The other set of amend 
ments, numbering nineteen, would seem to be in a clerk s hand. 
The latter is the completed draft, evidently used at a later stage 
in the work of the committee of opposition, and the first article 
or section has been altered in committee. 

FORMS OF A RESOLVE TO ACCOMPANY THE DECLARATION OF 
RIGHTS AND AMENDMENTS. 

Resolved, that the following Declaration of Rights and Amend 
ments be referred to the committee of the whole Convention upon 
the new constitution of government recommended by the late 
federal convention ; 

or 



APPENDIX. 445 



Resolved, that the following Declaration of Rights and Amend 
ments to the new constitution of government recommended by the 
late federal convention, ought to be communicated and referred 
to the other States in the American Union for their consideration, 
previous to its final ratification ; 

or 

Resolved, that the following Amendments ought to be made to 
the new constitution of governmnt recommended by the late 
federal Convention previous to the ratification thereof, and that 
the said Amendments be by this Convention communicated and 
referred to the other States in the American Union for their 
consideration ; 

or 

Resolved, that the new constitution of government recom 
mended by the late federal convention ought to be ratified when 
the following Declaration of Rights and Amendments shall be 
adopted ; and that the said Declaration of Rights and Amend 
ments be by this Convention communicated and referred to the 
other States in the Union. 

DECLARATION OF RIGHTS. 

That there be a Declaration or Bill of Rights, asserting and 
securing from encroachment the essential and un alienable rights 
of the people, in some such manner as the following. 

1. That all freemen have certain essential inherent rights, of 
which they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their pos 
terity ; among which are the enjoyment of life and liberty, with 
the means of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and 
pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety. 

2. That all power is naturally vested in, and consequently 
derived from, the people ; that magistrates therefore are their 
trustees and agents, and at all times amenable to them. 

3. That government, is or ought to be, instituted for the common 
benefit, protection, and security of the people ; and that whenever 
any government shall be found inadequate, or contrary to these 
purposes, a majority of the community hath an indubitable, un- 
alienable, and indefeasible right, to reform, alter, or abolish it, and 
to establish another, in such manner as shall be judged most con- 



\\ 



446 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

ducive to the public weal ; and that the doctrine of non-resistance 
against arbitrary power and oppression is absurd, slavish, and 
destructive of the good and happiness of mankind. 

4. That no man, or set of men, are entitled to exclusive or sep 
arate public emoluments or privileges from the community, but in 
consideration of public services ; which not being descendible, 
neither ought the offices of magistrate, legislator, or judge, or any 
other public office, to be hereditary. 

5. That legislative, executive, and judiciary powers of government 
should be separate and distinct, and that the members of the two 
first may be restrained from oppression, by feeling and participa 
ting the public burthens, they should, at fixed periods, be reduced 
to a private station, return into the mass of the people, and the va 
cancies be supplied by certain and regular elections ; in which all 
or any part of the former members to be eligible, or ineligible, as 
the rules of the constitution of government, and the laws shall 
direct. 

6. That the right of the people to participate in the legislature is 
the best security of liberty, and the foundation of all free govern 
ment ; for this purpose, elections ought to be free and frequent ; 
and all men having sufficient evidence of permanent common in 
terest with, and attachment to the community, ought to have the 
right of suffrage ; and that no aid charge, tax or fee can be set, 
rated, or levied upon the people, without their own consent, or that 
of their representatives, so elected, nor can they be bound by any 
law to which they have not, in like manner, assented, for the public 
good. 

7. That all power of suspending laws or the execution of laws, 
by any authority, without the consent of the representatives of the 
people in the legislature, is injurious to their rights, and ought not 
to be exercised. 

8. That in all capital or criminal prosecutions, a man hath a 
right to demand the cause and nature of his accusation, to be con 
fronted with the accusers and witnesses, to call for evidence, and 
be admitted counsel in his favor, and to a fair and speedy trial by 
an impartial jury of his vicinage, without whose unanimous consent 
he cannot be found guilty (except in the government of the land 
and naval forces in time of actual war, invasion, or rebellion) nor 
can he be compelled to give evidence against himself. 



APPENDIX. 447 



9. That no freeman ought to be taken, imprisoned, or disseized 
of his freehold, liberties, privileges, or franchises, or outlawed or 
exiled, or in any manner destroyed, or deprived of his life, liberty 
or property, but by the law of the land. 

10. That every freeman restrained of his liberty, is entitled to a 
remedy to inquire into the lawfulness thereof, and to remove the 
same if unlawful, and that such remedy ought not to be denied 
or delayed. 

13. That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive 
fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. 

14. That every freeman has a right to be secure from all un 
reasonable searches and seizures of his person, his papers, and his 
property, all warrants therefore to search suspected places, or to 
seize any freeman, his papers or property, without information 
upon oath (or affirmation of a person religiously scrupulous of 
taking an oath) of legal and sufficient cause, are grievous and op 
pressive ; and all general warrants to search suspected places, or 

to apprehend any suspected person, without specially naming or / / 

describing the place or person, are dangerous, and ought not to be 
granted. 

11. That in controversies respecting property, and in suits 
between man and man, the ancient trial by jury of facts, where 
they arise, is one of the greatest securities to the rights of a free 
people, and ought to remain sacred and inviolable. 

1 6. That the people have a right to freedom of speech, and of 
writing and publishing their sentiments ; that the freedom of the 
press is one of the great bulwarks of liberty, and ought not to be 
violated. 

15. That the people have a right peaceably to assemble together 
to consult for their common good, or to instruct their representa 
tives, and that every freeman has a right to petition, or apply to 
the legislature for redress of grievances. 

12. That every freeman ought to find a certain remedy by re 
course to the laws, for all injuries or wrongs he may receive in his 
person, property, or character ; He ought to obtain right and 
justice freely, without sale, completely and without denial, promptly 
and without delay ; and that all establishments or regulations, con 
travening these rights are oppressive and unjust. 

17. That the people have a right to keep and to bear arms ; that 



448 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, 
trained to arms, is the proper, natural and safe defence of a free 
State ; that standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to 
liberty, and therefore ought to be avoided, as far as the circum 
stances and protection of the community will admit ; and that in 
all cases, the military should be under strict subordination to and 
governed by the civil power. 

1 8. That no soldier in time of peace ought to be quartered in 
any house without the consent of the owner ; and in time of war, 
only by the civil magistrate in such manner as the laws direct. 

19. That any person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms 
ought to be exempted upon payment of an equivalent, to employ 
another to bear arms in his stead. 

20. That religion, or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and 
the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and 
conviction, not by force or violence, and therefore all men have 
an equal, natural, and unalienable right to the free exercise of 
religion, according to the dictates of conscience ; and that no 
particular religious sect, or society of Christians, ought to be 
favored or established by law, in preference to others.

ERNMENT IN ADDITION TO THE DECLARATION OF RIGHTS.

V. 

PAPER ON CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS. 

The essential difference between the citizens of a free country, 
and the subjects of arbitrary or despotic governments, or in other 
words, between freemen and slaves, consists principally in this. 
That the citizens of a free country choose the men who are 
to make laws for them, and are therefore governed by no laws, 
but such as are made by men of their own choosing, in whom 
they can confide, who are amenable to them ; and if they abuse 
their trust can be turned out at the next election. But the 
subjects of arbitrary governments having no such right of suf 
frage, in electing their own law-makers, are governed by laws 
made by men whom they do not choose, who therefore are not 
amenable to them, over whom they have no control, in whom 
they have no confidence, with whom they have no common 
interest or fellowship ; and whose interest and views may be, and 
frequently will be in direct contrast and opposition to the rights 
and interest of the bulk of the people. Hence proceed partial 
and unjust laws, oppression and every species of tyranny. From 
these premises it is evident that this right of suffrage, in the choice 



454 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

of their own lawmakers is the foundation and support of all the 
other rights and privileges of freemen. And whenever they shall 
be deprived of it, all their other rights and privileges must soon 
moulder away and tumble to the ground. Whenever it shall be 
impaired or weakened, all the other rights and privileges of a free 
people will be impaired or weakened, in the same proportion. 
And Whenever, under any pretence whatever, the substance of this 
fundamental and precious right of suffrage shall be so far under 
mined or invalidated, as to leave the name or shadow of it only to 
the people, or to any particular part of the people, from thencefor 
ward, such people will possess only the name and shadow of 
liberty, which without the substance, is not worth preserving. 

It is surely therefore the duty of freemen a duty which they 
owe to themselves, to their country, to their children, and to gen 
erations yet unborn to watch over and guard this sacred and 
inestimable right of suffrage, and with manly firmness to resist the 
smallest attempt of invasion, or encroachment on it, for every en 
croachment will grow into a precedent for some other encroachment. 

There is great cause to apprehend, that at the next session of the 
Virginia Assembly, an attempt will be made, to deprive the people 
of Fairfax County of their right of suffrage, in choosing members 
of Congress ; or which amounts to nearly the same thing, to take 
from them the substance, and leave them only the name and 
shadow of choosing. When the new Constitution for the general 
government of the United States of America was first formed, Vir 
ginia was entitled to send only ten members to the House of 
Representatives in Congress. The whole State of Virginia was 
therefore laid off into only ten districts, each of which chose one 
member. Kentucky being one of those ten districts, chose one of 
the said ten members. The six counties of King George, Stafford, 
Prince William, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Fauquier composed another 
of those ten districts, for choosing one of the said ten members. 
But by the census or enumeration of all the inhabitants of the 
United States, taken last year, the number of members in the 
House of Representatives, from almost every State in the Union, 
will be greatly increased. From Virginia the number will be more 
than doubled, and consequently the number of the former districts 
must be more than doubled also, and the size and extent of them 
lessened in the same proportion : for at the next election, some 
time in the course of next winter, Virginia instead of sending nine 



APPENDIX. 455 



members (exclusive of Kentucky) to the House of Representatives 
in Congress, will be entitled to send twenty-one members, exclu 
sive of Kentucky. And for this purpose, when our Assembly 
meets next October, Virginia (exclusive of Kentucky) will be 
arranged, or laid off into twenty-one districts, each of which to 
choose one member. The five counties of Stafford, Prince Wil 
liam, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Fauquier (leaving out the county of 
King George, to be added to some of the lower counties) will now 
form two complete districts, and it will be attempted to make 
Fairfax and Loudoun compose one of these two districts ; and 
Stafford, Prince William and Fauquier compose the other district ; 
by which means the substance of the right of suffrage, in electing 
members of Congress will be taken from the people of Fairfax, 
and the name or shadow only left them. For the voters in Lou 
doun County being near three times the number of the voters in 
Fairfax ; while that local attachment and partiality continues to 
influence the bulk of mankind, which ever has influenced them, 
and ever will influence them, while human nature continues what 
it now is and always has been ; a candidate in Fairfax (let him be 
ever so good a man) will have no chance of succeeding against one 
in Loudoun ; the comparative merits of the candidates will be 
sacrificed to local attachment, and the people in Fairfax will, in 
reality, have little more hand in electing their nominal represent 
atives in Congress than they have in electing the representatives 
of Maryland or Pennsylvania. And this act of injustice and op 
pression will be further aggravated, in eight or nine years ; for 
when the town of Alexandria and that part of the federal district 
of ten miles square which lies on this side of Potomack River, are 
taken out of the jurisdiction of Virginia, Loudoun County which 
now has three votes to our one, will then have near six votes to 
our one ; and the people of Fairfax will not find it worth their 
while to give their votes, or attend the elections of members of 
Congress. What the people of Fairfax County have done to de 
serve this injurious treatment, and forfeiture of their dearest 
rights and privileges, let the contrivers of this nefarious project 
declare. 1 

1 Whatever may be the pretence, the real motive (here at least) for endeavor 
ing to join Fairfax County in the district with Loudoun, is to secure the election 
of Mr. Richard Bland Lee, which his friends apprehend may be rendered pre 
carious by placing Loudoun in the same district with Fauquier. This apprehen- 



456 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

It is said (perhaps untruly) that some of the people in Alex 
andria, and within the federal district, are in favor of this scheme. 
Such of them as are men of liberal minds, can hardly be presumed 
to be so, but they stand on very different ground from the people 
of the county, for they will sacrifice only a temporary interest of 
short duration, as in eight or nine years (perhaps sooner) they will 
be taken out of the jurisdiction of Virginia ; but to the people in 
every other part of the county, the sacrifice will not be temporary 
but permanent. If the three small counties of Stafford, Prince 
William, and Fairfax compose one complete district, and the two 
large counties of Loudoun and Fauquier compose another complete 
district, as of right they ought to do, the counties in each respective 
district will have nearly an equal number of voters, and will be a 
fair match for each other. The people in each county will then 
have, not in name only, but in substance and reality, an equal 
right of suffrage in electing members of Congress : a candidate in 
either county will have a fair trial with a candidate in another 
county ; and the comparative merits of the candidates will gener 
ally prevail against local attachment and prejudice. It is notorious, 
that for these very reasons, when in the formation of the Virginia 
Government in the year 1776, the four and twenty districts were 
arranged for the election of senators, the counties of Prince Wil 
liam and Fairfax were formed into one district, and the counties of 
Loudoun and Fauquier into another district, and still continue so. 
And surely the same reasons hold at least equally strong, in the 
choice of members of Congress, whose powers, since the establish 
ment of the new federal constitution, are much greater and more 
important, than those which now remain to the State Legislatures. 
And as there is just ground to believe that the arrangement of dis 
tricts, which will be made next fall, will hardly ever be materially 
altered, it is of the utmost consequence, that they should be 
fairly and justly made, and not with a view of serving any tem 
porary, local party -job whatever. 1 

sion seems to be ill founded, but if it was ever so well founded, and if Mr. Lee 
was the last man in the United States, nothing can be more absurd and wicked 
than to sacrifice the rights of the people to the views or interest of an individual. 
And a candidate for Fairfax County, by adopting this iniquitous scheme, will 
give the most indisputable proof of his being unworthy of public trust.

VI. 

WILL OF GEORGE MASON OF " GUNSTON." 

I, George Mason of Gunston Hall in the parish of Truro and 
county of Fairfax, being of perfect and sound mind and memory 
and in good health, but mindful of the uncertainty of human life 
and the imprudence of a man s leaving his affairs to be settled 
upon a death bed, do make and appoint this my last Will and Testa 
ment. My soul I resign into the hands of my Almighty Creator 
whose tender mercies are over all his works, who hateth nothing 
that he hath made, and to the Justice and Wisdom of whose dis 
pensation I willingly and cheerfully submit ; humbly hoping from 
his unbounded mercy and benevolence thro the merits of my 
blessed Saviour a remission of my sins. My body I desire may 
be decently buried at the discretion of my Executors hereinafter 
named, close by the side of my dear and ever lamented wife. And 
as for all the worldly Estate with which it has pleased God to bless 
me I dispose of it in manner and form following. Imprimis : It is 
my will and desire and I hereby direct and order that all my lands, 
slaves with their increase, stocks, rents, crops, tobacco and money 
and debts due to me with the yearly interest arising thereon, with 
all my other Estate of what nature soever, in Virginia, Maryland 
or elsewhere, be kept together and considered as one common 
stock for the payment of my debts and legacys and the main 
tenance and education of my children and the payment of their 
fortunes, until my said children respectively come of age or marry ? 
when and not before, each of them is to receive his or her part of 
the same, as hereinafter respectively devised or bequeathed to each 

of the States in the Union, and thereby become an article of the said Constitu 
tion ; by which (to the best of my recollection, for I have not a copy of the 
amendment by me) the ratio of thirty thousand is to be applied to the census of 
the inhabitants of the United States, to ascertain and apportion the representa 
tion, until the number of the House of Representatives shall amount to one hun 
dred : after which Congress is empowered to alter and increase the ratio in such 
manner as they shall judge fit ; provided that the number of the House of 
Representatives shall never be less than one hundred. The late census will 
increase the House of Representatives to something more than one hundred 
members : and there is therefore cause to believe, that the arrangement of the 
districts to be made next fall, will never be materially increased or altered.

of them, and when any one of my children shall come of age or 
marry and receive his or her part of the same accordingly, the 
residue still to continue and remain in the said common stock 
until another of my children shall come of age or marry, and so on 
in the same manner until the youngest of my children shall come 
of age or marry and receive his or her part of the same as afore 
said ; it being my intention that my Executors shall not have the 
trouble and perplexity of keeping different accounts with all my 
children, but only one general account for the whole. 

Item : I give and bequeath unto each of my four daughters, 
Ann Mason, Sarah Mason, Mary Mason and Elizabeth Mason 
and each of their heirs forever when they respectively arrive at 
the age of twenty-one years, or marry, whichever shall first happen, 
the following slaves with their increase respectively from the date 
of this my will : to my eldest daughter Ann the four following 
slaves and their increase, to wit Bess (the daughter of Chloe) and 
her child, Frank, mulatto Priss (the daughter of Jenny) and Nell 
(the daughter of Occoquan Nell). To my daughter Sarah the 
three following slaves with their increase, to wit Hannah and 
Venus (the daughter of Becky) and mulatto Mima (the daughter 
of Jenny). To my daughter Mary the three following slaves with 
their increase to wit, Ann and Nell, the daughter of house Nell, 
and little Jenny (the daughter of Jenny). To my daughter Eliz 
abeth the three following slaves with their increase, to wit Vicky 
(the daughter of Occoquan Nell), Sarah (the daughter of great 
Sue), and Rachel (the daughter of Beck). And I confirm unto 
my three eldest daughters Ann, Sarah, and Mary their right and 
title respectively to one negro girl given to each of them by their 
grandfather Mr. William Eilbeck deceased, to wit a negro girl 
named Penny to my daughter Ann, a negro girl named Priss to my 
daughter Sarah, and a negro girl named Nan to my daughter Mary. 
But in the meantime that is until my daughters respectively come 
of age or marry, the profits of all such of the above mentioned 
slaves as shall not be employed in waiting upon any of my said 
daughters, or for their use in the house, are to remain in and be 
considered as part of the common stock for the purposes herein 
before mentioned, and if any one or more of my said daughters 
should happen to die under age or unmarried, then and in that case 
it is my will and desire and I hereby direct and order that all the 



APPENDIX. 459 



slaves with their increase hereinbefore bequeathed to such daugh 
ter or daughters, shall go to and be equally divided between my 
other daughters or to the survivor of them, to be delivered them or 
her as hereinbefore directed. I also give to each of my said four 
daughters one bed and furniture to be delivered them at the time 
and in the manner aforesaid. 

Item : I give and bequeath unto each of my said four 
daughters Ann, Sarah, Mary and Elizabeth, except such of 
them as may happen to marry and have actually received their 
fortune in my lifetime, the sum of six hundred pounds sterling 
out of my money debts due to me and the profits of the com 
mon stock of my Estate, the said sum of six hundred pounds 
sterling to be paid to each of them without defalcation or dimi 
nution, when they respectively arrive at the age of twenty-one 
years or marry, whichever shall first happen exclusive of any sum 
or sums given or to be given to any of them by their grandmother 
Mrs. Eilbeck, or for which I have taken or may take bonds for 
their use or in any of their respective names ; and if any one of my 
said daughters should die under age or unmarried, it is my will and 
desire and I hereby direct and order, that the money herein be 
queathed to such daughter shall go to be equally divided between 
all my other surviving daughters, such of them as may happen to 
be of age or married at the time to receive their part of the same, 
and the residue to remain in the common stock until my other 
surviving daughters respectively come of age or marry, but if two 
or more of my daughters should happen to die under age or un 
married, then and in that case it is my will and desire and I hereby 
direct and order, that so much of their money only shall go to my 
surviving daughter or daughters as will increase the fortune of 
each or either of them to the sum of one thousand pounds ster 
ling, exclusive of their slaves or of any money given them by their 
grandmother Mrs. Eilbeck as aforesaid, to be paid them or her in 
the manner above directed, and that the residue shall remain in the 
common stock for the benefit of my four youngest sons in the 
manner hereinafter directed. 

Item : I give and devise unto my eldest son George Mason 
and his heirs forever when he arrives at the age of twenty-one 
years or marrys, whichever shall first happen, my mansion 
house and seat of Gunston Hall with all my lands thereunto

belonging or adjoining, being between five and six thousand 
acres, also a small tract of land adjoining to the land of the 
Revd. Mr. Lee Massey purchased by my father of Giles and 
Benoni Tillett, and in general all my lands between Potomack 
river, Occoquan river and Pohick creek in Fairfax County, ex 
cepting and reserving unto my Executors the right and privilege 
of keeping three Quarters, upon the said land to be considered as 
part of the common stock of my Estate for the benefit of my 
younger children, and of working the same number of hands as are 
worked at the said three Quarters respectively at the time of my 
death, with the right and privilege of getting timber for the proper 
use of the said three Quarters or plantations on any part of the 
said lands, that is to say one Quarter in the bottom of Dogues Neck 
(commonly called the Occoquan Quarter), until all my sons come 
of age, with all the land which I have usually tended and made 
use of at the said Quarter, and such other convenient and adjoin 
ing land as is necessary for the use of the same, and the benefit of 
suffering all the stock properly belonging to the said Quarter to 
range and run at large in the said Neck, and the two other Quar 
ters at Hallowing s Point and upon the land I bought of William 
Courts, until all my sons except the youngest come of age, with 
all the land between [the] upper line of the said tract bought of 
William Courts, the river and the great marsh, and the benefit of 
all the stock properly belonging to the said two Quarters, ranging 
and running at large within the new Neck fence, my Executors 
keeping the said Quarters and plantations in good order and 
repair and delivering up the same accordingly at the respective 
expiration of the times aforesaid, or when the crops then growing 
thereon are finished, unto my said son George Mason or his heirs. 
But if my said son George Mason should die under age and un 
married, it is my will and desire and I hereby direct and order that 
all the lands herein devised unto him shall go and descend unto 
his heirs at law and his heirs forever, in the same manner as if my 
said son George had been in the actual possession of the same 
before his death, and shall not be divided among my residuary 
Legatees hereinafter named. 

Item : I give and bequeath unto my said son George Mason 
and his heirs forever when he arrives at the age of twenty-one 
years or marrys, whichever shall first happen, the seven follow- 



APPENDIX. 461 



ing slaves to wit Alec, Bob, Dunk, yellow Dick, Bob (the son 
of Occoquan Nell), Peter (the son of great Sue), Judy and 
Lucy together with all the slaves which shall properly belong to 
and reside at my two upper Quarters in Dogues Neck adjoin 
ing to the great marsh at the time of my death, (except such of 
them as may happen to be any of the slaves by name specifically 
bequeathed to some of my other children,) also all my stock 
of horses, cattle, sheep and hogs which shall properly belong to 
and be wintered at my said two upper Quarters in Dogues Neck, 
at the time of my death, with all the plantation utensils and imple 
ments of husbandry thereto belonging, also one fifth part of all 
my Books and household furniture in and about my dwelling 
house, but if my said son George Mason should die before he 
comes of age and unmarried, then and in that case it is my will and 
desire and I hereby direct and order, that all the slaves as well as 
all the personal Estate hereinbefore bequeathed him, shall be 
equally divided between my other surviving sons, and for that 
purpose shall remain in the common stock until my other sons re 
spectively come of age or marry. Item : I give and bequeath unto 
my said son George and his heirs forever, all my stock in the Ohio 
Company as a member thereof, together with my share and part 
of all the said Company s lands, but whatever ballance (if any at 
the time of my death) appears by my books of account to be due 
from me to the said Ohio Company is to be paid out of the com 
mon stock of my Estate in the same manner as any other debts. 
I also give and bequeath unto my said son George Mason my Gold 
watch which I commonly wear, also a large silver salver which 
being an old piece of family plate I desire may remain unaltered. 
And I confirm unto him his right and title to a negro man named 
Dick given him by his grandfather Mr. Eilbeck, and likewise his 
right and title to two negro men named Tom and Liberty ex 
changed with him by me for two other negroes given him by his 
grandmother Mrs. Eilbeck, also to a large silver Bowl given him 
by my mother in which all my children have been christened, and 
which I desire may remain in the family unaltered for that pur 
pose. And whereas my son George will soon be of age, and if I 
should happen to die during the minority of my other children 
they will probably live with him, and he may not chuse to charge 
his brothers and sisters with their board, altho it must put him

to considerable trouble and expence, then and in that case there 
fore, I give unto my said son George whilst my children live with 
him as aforesaid the right and privilege of taking in any year from 
any of my Quarters whilst they remain in the common stock, such 
Quantity of provisions for his family s use, and also of employing 
such and so many of my house servants in his family as he and my 
other Executor shall judge reasonable and necessary for the above 
mentioned purpose and adequate to the expence and trouble 
thereby occasioned, without being accountable for the same.

my tract of land called Stump Neck (formerly called Dogues 
Neck) with two hundred acres of land thereto adjoining and in 
cluded in the same original patent, excepting and reserving to my 
Executors the right and privilege of retaining and keeping in their 
hands as part of the common stock of my Estate, for the benefit of 
my younger children, until all my sons come of age the last men 
tioned tract of land called Stump Neck with the said two hundred 
acres of land thereto adjoining, and of keeping a Quarter thereon 
and working the same number of hands for the purpose aforesaid 
as worked on the same at the time of my death. I also give and

on George Adams now lives) near Port Tobacco in the said 
county and province, the same being one moiety of a tract of land

working hands on each upon such parts thereof as they shall think 
fit unless the said Quarters shall be settled thereon by me in my 
lifetime, and retaining and keeping in their hands one of the said 
Quarters so settled by me or them, with land thereto adjoining 
sufficient to work the hands belonging to the same as part of the 
common stock until all my sons come of age. I also give and de

upon the upper side of Dogues Run adjoining to Matthew s patent, 
and in general I give and devise unto my said son Thomson Mason

the other land hereinbefore devised unto my son Thomson Mason 
shall if he die under age and unmarried, as aforesaid go and 
descend unto my eldest son and heir George Mason and his heirs 
forever, in the same manner as if my said son Thomson had been

before devised unto my said son John Mason upon and between 
the main south run of Accotink and the branches of Difficult Run 
shall if he die under age and unmarried, as aforesaid go and

466 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

Si: Benedict s originally granted to Bennett Marchgay, the next 
called Mason s Fields patented by my mother Mrs. Ann Mason, 
the next interfering with Mason s Fields, a tract of one hundred 
and fifty acres without any particular name whereon Henry 
Fletcher formerly lived who purchased the same of Henry Aspinall 
to whom it was originally granted, and the upper [part] called 
Fletcher s Addition originally granted to the said Henry Fletcher, 
and in general all my lands between Chickamuxon Creek and 
Goose Bay in the said county and province, and if my said son 
Thomas Mason should die under age and unmarried, then and in 
that case I give and devise all the above mentioned lands between 
Chickamuxon Creek and Goose Bay in Charles County in the 
province of Maryland, unto my son William Mason and his heirs 
forever. But it is my will and desire and I hereby direct and 
order, that all the other lands hereinbefore devised unto my said 
son Thomas Mason in the County of Prince William and Colony 
of Virginia, together with the right and benefit of keeping 
Occoquan ferry, shall if he die under age and unmarried, 
as aforesaid go and descend unto my eldest son and heir George 
Mason and his heirs forever in the same manner as if my said 
son Thomas had been in actual possession of the same before his 
death. Item : I give and bequeath unto my said son Thomas 
Mason and his heirs forever, when he arrives at the age of twenty- 
one years or marrys, whichever shall first happen, the two follow 
ing slaves to wit Jack (the son of house Nell) and Daphne (the 
daughter of Dinah), also one fifth part of all my books and house 
hold furniture in and about my dwelling house. Item : I give 
and bequeath unto my said son Thomas Mason the sum of six 
hundred pounds sterling to be paid him when he arrives at the 
age of twenty-one years or marrys, whichever shall first happen, 
out of my money and debts due to me and the profits of my Estate 
if so much remain in the common stock after the payment of my 
debts and legacys, the maintenance and education of my children 
and the payment of my daughters fortunes, and if there is not so 
much as the said sum of six hundred pounds sterling then what 
ever lesser sum there is remaining in the said common stock. 
And least the manner in which I have limited and directed the 
descent of some of my land should occasion any dispute or induce 
an opinion that I intended to intail them, I hereby declare that it 



APPENDIX. 467 



is not my intention to intail any part of my Estate upon any of 
my children, but to give all and each of my sons when they respec 
tively come of age or marry, an absolute fee simple estate in all 
the lands respectively devised them and in all such lands also as 
any of them may happen to take by the death of any of their 
Brothers, the common legal descent of some of my lands being 
hereinbefore altered only in case any of my sons to whom such 
lands are respectively devised should die under age and unmar 
ried while their lands remained in the common stock of my Estate 
and had not yet come into their actual possession. And whereas 
I hold sundry tracts of land in the county of Hampshire in Vir 
ginia, and in the county of Frederick in the province of Maryland 
near Fort Cumberland, patented in my name in trust for the Ohio 
Company, I authorize and direct my Executors to convey the same 
by such deeds as council learned in the law shall advise (with 
special warranty only against my heirs and all claiming under me) 
unto the said Ohio Company upon their paying the ballance of my 
bond with the Interest thereon due to Mrs. Bladen or Mrs. Tasker s 
Executors, for the purchase of part of the said lands so that the 
said bond may be taken up and cancelled and my Estate indem 
nified therefrom excepting and reserving unto my eldest son George 
Mason and his heirs forever my part and share of and in the said 
lands as a member of the said Ohio Company. 

Item : All the remaining part of my slaves with their increase, 
stocks of all kinds, and money and debts due to me, crops, profits 
and all other personal Estate whatsoever in the common stock not 
herein otherwise disposed of I give and bequeath unto my four 
youngest sons William, Thomson, John and Thomas (whom I 
make my residuary legatees) and their heirs forever to be equally 
divided between them when and as they respectively arrive at the 
age of twenty-one years or marry, whichever shall first happen, 
and if any one or more of my said youngest sons should die 
under age and unmarried, then and in that case it is my will and 
desire and I hereby direct and order, that all the slaves together 
with all the stocks, money or other personal Estate whatsoever 
bequeathed to such son or sons or which he or they would have 
been entitled to upon coming of age or marrying, shall be equally 
divided between the survivors of all my five sons George, William, 
Thomson, John and Thomas, such of them as may happen to be 



468 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

of age or married at the time to receive their part of the same and 
the residue to remain in the common stock until the others respec 
tively come of age or marry or shall go to the survivor of my said 
five sons if only one of them should live to come of age or marry, 
and if any of my sons or daughters should happen to marry and 
die during the minority of their Brothers or Sisters leaving a child 
or children behind them, it is my Will and desire and I hereby 
direct and order that such child or children shall receive the 
same part or portion of the Estate which the parent or parents 
would have been entitled to upon the death of any of my sons or 
daughters respectively under age and unmarried as aforesaid. 

And whereas there is in my hands as Executor of Mr. William 
Eilbeck deed, a considerable sum (as will appear by my account 
with his Estate) which by his Will is bequeathed to and divided 
among his Grandchildren, my children, which I am answerable to 
them for and have a power of laying out for their benefit, and as 
I have hereinbefore not only given much more to each of my said 
children than their respective shares of his Estate in my hands 
amounts to but have disposed both of that and my own Estate 
among them in order to make the best provision in my power for 
them all, and if any of my children were notwithstanding to claim 
after my death their parts of their said Grandfather s Estate in my 
hands over and above what I have given them, it would occa 
sion much confusion and alter the disposition which I have here 
inbefore made to the prejudice and injury of some of my children, 
I do therefore declare that what I have hereinbefore given unto 
all and each of my said children is inclusive of and in satisfaction 
for what was due to them from me as Mr. Eilbeck s Executor and 
that the several devises, bequests and legacys herein devised be 
queathed or given to each of my said children are upon express 
condition of each of them respectively releasing and discharging 
my Estate and Executors from any claim or demand on account 
of the ballance due from me to the said Mr. Eilbeck s Estate per 
account already settled or to be settled with the commissary in 
Maryland, and if any one or more of my said children when they 
respectively come of age should refuse to release and discharge my 
Executors accordingly, then and in that case it is my Will and de 
sire and I hereby direct and order that all the Estate herein by me 
given to such child or children shall be forfeited and shall go to 



APPENDIX. 469 



and be equally divided among my other children and their heirs 
forever. And as there are debts due to me to a considerable 
amount by bond the yearly interest of which will be a great advan 
tage to the common stock of my Estate, I desire and direct my 
Executors to continue the said debts upon interest either in such 
hands as they shall be in at the time of my death, or in such other 
hands and upon such other security as they in their discretion shall 
judge best, until the money shall be wanting from time to time for 
any of the purposes by me directed, and likewise to let out upon 
interest such money as can at any time be spared out of the profits 
of my Estate. I also authorize and direct my Executors to settle 
a Quarter or Quarters upon my land between Dogues Run and the 
South Branch of little Hunting Creek, as hereinbefore mentioned 
(unless the same shall have been settled by me before my death) 
when they shall think it most for the interest of my Estate so 
to do, as also upon any of the other lands herein devised to 
either of my three youngest sons Thomson, John or Thomas, 
either with any slaves that can be spared from my other Quar 
ters or plantations or with slaves to be purchased by them for 
that purpose with any money that can be spared out of the com 
mon stock of my Estate, without interfering with my daughters 
Fortunes or with the money bequeathed unto my youngest son 
Thomas, all which Quarters and slaves are to be considered as part 
of the common stock for the purposes before expressed. 

I likewise impower and direct my Executors to erect marble 
Tomb stones over the graves of my honored father and mother and 
my dear wife if the same is not done by me in my life time. And 
that no dispute or difficulty may arise to my Executors or my 
children about the manner in which that part of my estate given 
to my residuary Legatees is to be divided among them, I hereby 
declare it to be my Will and intention that when each or either of 
them comes of age or marrys, he is to receive his part or portion 
thereof as it stands at such time respectively (always having regard 
to and reserving a sufficient sum of my money and debts still in 
the common stock to pay the money that may hereafter be due to 
any of my daughters for their fortunes, as well as the money 
bequeathed to my youngest son Thomas Mason) so that any of 
them after having received and withdrawn their parts from the 
common stock are not to be entitled to any share of the subse-

quent increase or profits thereof, and consequently not to any of 
the slaves that may afterwards be born or purchased, nor liable 
to any loss that may happen therein except such part of the com 
mon stock as may happen afterwards to fall to them by the death 
of some of their brothers or sisters, yet the fortunes herein given 
to my daughters in money are to be secured to them notwith 
standing at all events, and in case of any deficiency in their said 
fortunes by failure of securitys or any other inevitable accident, 
the same is to be made good in equal proportion by all my residu 
ary Legatees as well those who had before as those who had not 
received their parts out of the common stock. And I appoint 
my good friends the Revd. Mr. James Scott, the Revd. Mr. Lee 
Massey, Mr. John West jun., Colo. George Washington and Mr. 
Alexander Henderson (whenever it shall be necessary) to make 
such estimation, division and alotment to and among my several 
residuary legatees, and it is my Will and desire and I hereby direct 
and order that such estimation, division and alotment as they or 
any three of them shall from time to time make and give under 
their hands and seals, shall to all intents and purposes whatso 
ever be conclusive and binding upon my said residuary Legatees 
and their heirs. I hope they will be so charitable as not to 
refuse undertaking this trouble for the sake of a friend who 
when living would cheerfully have done them any good office in 
his power. 

I recommend it to my sons from my own experience in life, to 
prefer the happiness of independance and a private station to the 
troubles and vexation of publick business, but if either their own 
inclinations or the necessity of the times should engage them in 
public affairs, I charge them on a father s blessing never to let the 
motives of private interest or ambition induce them to betray, nor 
the terrors of poverty and disgrace, or the fear of danger or of death, 
deter them from asserting the liberty of their country and endeav 
oring to transmit to their posterity those sacred rights to which 
themselves were born. 

I release and remit unto my brother Thomson Mason and 
his heirs forever, a certain debt of three hundred and ten 
pounds, four shillings and five pence f- sterling and nine pounds 
twelve shillings and four pence currency, due to me on ac 
count of money advanced for him many years ago while he 



APPENDIX. 471 



was in England, for which it was never my intention to make 
him answerable as will appear by an entry to that purpose in 
my own handwriting annexed to the account in my book. And 
whereas my said brother is indebted to me a further consid 
erable sum on account of a protested bill of exchange drawn 
by him and of a bond I paid for him to Mrs. Bronaugh s 
Estate, I desire and direct my Executors not to bring any 
suit against him for the recovery of the said debt but to wait 
until he can conveniently pay the same. I give and bequeath 
unto Mrs. Heath the wife of Thomas Heath of Stafford County, 
the sum of forty shillings sterling in first cost of goods a year, to 
be laid out in necessarys for her own particular use during her life, 
and if ever her son Mr. Richard Hewit my old schoolfellow and 
acquaintance from my childhood, should unfortunately be reduced 
to necessitous circumstances I desire and direct my Executors to 
supply him with necessarys for his support and maintenance out 
of my Estate, and I particularly recommend this care to my chil 
dren if it should be necessary after they come of age. 

I give to Mr. John Moncure a mourning ring of three Guineas 
value which I desire him to wear in memory of my esteem for my 
much lamented friend his deceased father. I desire my old and long 
tryed friends the Rev. Mr. James Scott and Mr. John West junr. 
each of them to accept of a mourning ring of the same value. I 
leave to my friend and relation the Rev. Mr. Lee Massey a mourn 
ing ring of the same value, and I entreat the favour of him to 
advise and assist my Executors in the direction and management 
of my affairs. I am encouraged to request this of him from the 
experience I have had myself of his good offices that way, and I 
am satisfied that both he and my worthy friend Mr. Cockburn 
will excuse the trouble I now give them, when they reflect upon 
the necessity that dying men are under of thus employing the care 
and kindness of the living which must also one day be their own 
case, and as the most acceptable acknowledgement I can make 
them, I desire them to receive out of the common stock of my 
Estate, the sum of ten pounds a year to be laid out by them in 
private charitys upon such as they shall judge worthy objects. I 
also give to my cousin Mrs. Cockburn a mourning ring of the 
same value, and desire her and my cousin Miss Bronaugh and 
Mr. Cockburn to accept of a suit of mourning each. Lastly, I

appoint my eldest son George Mason and my good friend Mr. 
Martin Cockburn, Executors of this my last Will and Testament 
and guardians to my children until they respectively come of age. 
And it is my Will and desire and I hereby direct and order that 
no securitys shall be required of them by the court but only their 
own bonds taken for the performance. In Witness whereof I 
have to this my said last Will and testament all in my own hand 
writing and contained in fifteen pages set my hand and affixed my 
seal this 2oth day of March in the year of our Lord one Thousand 
seven hundred and seventy three.

At a court contd. and held for Fairfax County i6th October 
1792 this will was presented in court by George Mason one of the 
Executors therein named who made oath thereto and the same 
being proved by the oath of Ann Cockburn and Robert Graham 
is admitted to record and the said Executor having performed 
what the law requires in such cases a certificate is granted him for 
obtaining a probate thereof in due form.

LAND DESCRIBED IN GEORGE MASON S WILL, AND NOW OWNED 
BY HIS DESCENDANTS. 

It was incorrectly stated in one of the earlier chapters of these 
volumes that " Lexington " was the only one of the Mason places 
in Virginia now in the family. The writer had overlooked " Oke- 
ley," in Fairfax County, about six miles from Alexandria. The 
farms of " Okeley " and " Huntley " were both parts of the estate 
bequeathed by George Mason to his son, Thomson Mason, of 



APPENDIX. 473 



" Hollin Hall." A double ditch is still to be seen on the southern 
border of these two places, extending several miles from east to 
west, with a broad space about thirty feet wide separating the two 
ditches. These mark the line between the lands of George Mason 
and George Washington, as they were in the lives of those gentle 
men. In General Washington s will, he refers " to the back line 
or outer boundary of the tract between Thompson Mason and 
myself . . . (now double ditching, with a post-and-rail 
fence thereon)," etc. And he mentions, in another place, " the 
new double ditch," in connection with the boundary line between 
" Mount Vernon " and the Mason property. In adding to his 
estate, he had purchased land at one time from George Mason. 
And among the Washington papers preserved in the Lewis and 
Washington families, and recently sold to autograph collectors, 
are three letters of George Mason, on the subject of the bounds 
between the Washington and Mason plantations, one written in 
1768, the others in 1769. Washington adds a memorandum to 
the former, saying that " the lines to which this letter has refer 
ence were settled by and between Colonel Mason and myself the 
1 9th of April, 1769 as will appear ... by a survey thereof 
made on that day in his presence and with his approbation." 

" Huntley," owned by Judge Thomson F. Mason, of " Colross," 
son of Thomson Mason, of " Hollin Hall," passed out of the 
family some years ago. " Okeley," which was the home of Dr. 
Richard Chichester Mason, another son of Thomson Mason, is 
still in possession of his descendants, and is the residence of Mr. 
Beverley Randolph Mason. The commodious dwelling-house, 
formerly to be seen there, however, was burned to the ground 
during the late war, and many valuable family papers perished 
in this wanton and unnecessary destruction of private property. 
The estate, of about seven thousand acres, is a beautiful and 
productive one. 

A descendant of Thomas Mason, youngest son of George 
Mason, owns a farm in Charles County, Maryland, which may 
have been some of it, part of the Maryland land mentioned in 
the will of the second Col. George Mason. In this connection, 
the reader interested in the subject is referred to an article in The 
Critic, Richmond, Va., Oct. 22, 1888, entitled "Curious Wills in 
the Mason Family." 



474 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE MASON. 

EXTRACT FROM A LETTER OF LUND WASHINGTON TO GENERAL 

WASHINGTON. 

The following extract from a letter of Lund Washington to 
General Washington, dated " Mount Vernon," February 18, 1778, 
kindly furnished the author by Dr. Joseph M. Toner, while these 
volumes are going through the press, relates to " Conway s Cabal," 
which was supposed to have found supporters among members 
of Congress. The conversation here related gives interesting 
testimony to the admiration which was felt both by George 
Mason and Richard Henry Lee, for the genius and patriotism of 
the Commander-in-chief. 

" Colonel Mason (who I showed your letter of the i6th of Janu 
ary) tells me he was informed of the cabal against you, before he 
left Williamsburg, and some had hinted to him that R. H. Lee 
was one suspected of having a hand in it, and as they knew the 
intimacy existing between them, begged that he would talk to Lee 
and discover whether anything of the sort was in agitation or not. 
He did so. That Lee declares no such thing or even a hint has 
ever been mentioned in Congress, and that he should look upon 
it as one of the greatest misfortunes that could befall this conti 
nent, should you by any means whatever give up the command 
of the army, for fully convinced he was in his own opinion no 
other man upon this continent was equal to the task ; that he had 
often lamented the heavy burden you bare, and the difficulties 
you had to surmount more than any man ever had before. For 
his part he looked upon it as one among the many favors we had 
received from above, that the Supreme Being had been pleased to 
save and protect in the most miraculous degree the only man in 
whom every one could confide in. Mr. Mason is of opinion it is a 
Tory manoeuver for he thinks no friend to America can be an 

enemy to you, for by , which was his expression, there is 

not nor ever was in the world a man who acted from a more laud 
able and disinterested motive than you do, and that he defied all 
history to show a war, begun, and carried on, under more disad 
vantages than the present ; nor, he would venture to affirm one 
that had been better conducted so far as it depended on the 
Commander-in-Chief, for that he had observed you had foreseen 
and pointed out what would be the event of all the blunders com- 



APPENDIX. 475 



mitted by the different legislatures, and that wherever you had 
given your opinion the event had proved you were right, then 
enumerated a number of instances to prove his assertion. Mr. 
Mason concluded by saying that he was convinced from the whole 
of his conversation with Lee, Harrison, and other members of 
Congress, that a faction in Congress against you had never 
existed. Our conversation passed in Alexandria before several 
gentlemen, among whom was Major Jennifer of Maryland."
