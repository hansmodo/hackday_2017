Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to inform you, that the King has made 
choice of M. Bonne-Carrere, director general of the Departe-ment Politique  to succeed M. Ternant as minister plenipotentiary from France to the United States. M. Bonne-Carrere 
regrets that it has not been in his power to announce to you 
himself his nomination to a post, which will continue and he 
hopes will augment his relations with you. But he is prevented by a very severe rheumatic attack, which not only confines 
him to his bed, but disables him from every kind of effort. He 
will seize the first moment after his recovery to call and see 
you, but he is not willing to delay any longer to reiterate to 
you the assurances of his zeal, and the sentiments with which 
you have inspired him. 
</p><p>
I undertake with great pleasure on this occasion the office of 
his interpreter, and I have the honor to be^ &;c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I call your attention again to day to the important subject, dissussed in our yesterday s conversation, only that I may convince you of the necessity of preventing the greater inconveniences, which would result from the pretended insufficiency 
of your powers, f Upon the principle, that your instructions 
do not authorise you to treat with the new French government, your functions would be, at this moment, void ; and our 
colonies, whose urgent need of supplies demands our care, activity, and zeal, would be in danger of remaining in want of them. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to observe, Sir, that we think too highly of the sentiments of friendship and affection, which the United 
States entertain towards France, to believe that their representative could, or ought to hesitate, under any pretext whatever, to promote the success of an arrangement, begun by <a href='/results.php?tla=' rel=''>Mr Short</a>, and the continuation of which has been confided to your care. 
</p><p>
The suspension of the King s functions should make no alteration, Sir, in the dispositions of a nation, with whom we are connected by friendship and interest, and whose independence 
is our work, (et dont independence est notre ouvrage.) She knows all the efforts and sacrifices we have made to obtain it for her. We do not say this to awaken your gratitude, but 
to excite your good will. I think, Sir, this was due from you to the French nation, before the actual accomplishment of this 
object, and that if you manifest it at this time, you will certainly meet the wishes of your constituents. 
</p><p>
To return, Sir, I ought to tell you, that the King is only suspended from his office; moreover the government, being 
immutable, and, of necessity, always subsisting, no representative can, without an express order from his court, or his constituents, refuse to treat directly with it. Since the establishment of the new T government, you have received from your 
constituents no order which could forbid this measure ; you can then, Sir, fulfil the engagement entered into by <a href='/results.php?tla=' rel=''>Mr Short</a>, relative to the eight hundred thousand dollars to be held at our 
disposal in North America, for the purchases necessary to supply our colonies. If the facts, which I have here placed before you, do not induce you to change the determination, 
which you made known to us yesterday, I beg you will have the goodness to assign the motives of your refusal, in the reply 
which I shall expect from you, and by which I shall be guided. I have the honor to be, &c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
By the answer you have returned to the letter, which I had 
the honor of writing to you on the thirtieth of August, I see 
that you have misunderstood certain expressions therein contained, and which were used relatively to circumstances. My 
object, in speaking to you of the existing Government, was to 
prove to you that it could not be dissolved, nor lose anything 
of its authority, so long as the nation had an existence. In consequence of this just and incontestible principle, I have sup 
posed that you might reside still in Paris, await here new credentials, and new instructions from your constituents, and, finally, continue to treat upon affairs interesting to both nations. 
</p><p>
You must be persuaded, Sir, that you would have found us 
eager to give you satisfaction, on every point founded in justice and reason. And as, doubtless, you would have brought 
forward no others, the result of our conferences, and of your 
proceedings towards us, would have been followed by the success you desired. 
</p><p>
As to the aversion, which you appear to feel to our present 
government, I think it right to remind you of a fact, which 
comes in aid of the principle just cited. It is this. When the 
inhabitants of North America resolved to separate themselves 
from England, and to gain their liberty, they sent representatives to France, to negotiate with the government, which made 
no difficulty in admitting them to a conference, and even concluding with them a treaty of friendship and commerce, as 
well as of alliance. Hardly had" the United Provinces called 
a Congress, when Dr Franklin was recognised by us in quality 
of Minister Plenipotentiary. He was admitted as one of the 
Diplomatic Corps to the audiences of the Court and the Minister. France, also, on her part, sent an accredited Minister 
to Congress. Yet, Sir, you know, that at that time no decisive measures had been taken for the establishment of a 
government in America, nor could there exist any settled 
government, since war was still carried on for the cause of 
independence and liberty. 
</p><p>
Our present position, therefore, and that of your country at that time, are very different. Of this you will be further convinced by the following fact. 
</p><p>
Before our revolution we had a government, which has subsisted continually since. It has, indeed, taken another 
form, but this form has been thus determined by the liberty 
and safety of the country. Besides, Sir, you, who were born 
in the midst of a free people, should regard the present affairs 
of France in a very different light, from that in which they appear to all other foreign ministers residing in Paris. We 
maintain the same cause with your country ; our principles 
and your own should be the same ; and by a natural train of 
consequences, there can be no reason against your residence in Paris. 
</p><p>
I wish, Sir, that this explanation of facts, as well known to you as to myself, may induce you to reconsider the subject, and decide you to change your resolution. 
</p><p>
However this may be, Sir, I have had the passport prepared, 
which you requested of me ; it is now with the municipality to 
go through the necessary forms. I hope to have it ready 
for you tomorrow. 
</p><p>
You see, Sir, by the subjoined extract from the reply of the 
Minister of Public Contributions, that you have entire satisfaction on every point contained in your letter of the 21st of Au 
gust last. I have the honor to observe to you, that the trifling 
personal casualties you have experienced, with regard to your 
effects, wines, &ic. are, as you are aware, a consequence of 
the agitation inseparable from a great revolution.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with sincere regard, Sir, your most obedient humble servant,

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received the letter you addressed to me yesterday, 
as also the accompanying papers. I sent a copy of them immediately to the Minister of the Marine, praying him to take 
the most prompt measures to procure for Captain Todd the 
satisfaction due to him, and to prevent, for the future, the 
vessels of our good allies from being exposed to the attacks of 
our ships of war and privateers. 
</p><p>
The inconvenience, which many of your fellow citizens have lately experienced, arises in part from the difficulty of distinguishing an American from an English vessel; and from the 
connivance there may be, among many individuals of both 
nations, for making disguised expeditions. In order to pre 
serve to the citizens of the United States all the advantages, 
which result from their neutrality, it is the interest of the 
American Government to prevent this fraud ; and I have every 
reason to believe, that the laws which determine, in the United 
States, the national flag, are clear and precise. I know that 
these laws require not only that the vessels be of American 
construction, but that the Captain and a great part of the 
crew be Americans. 
</p><p>
I pray you, Sir, to communicate to me the last statute made 
on this subject by Congress, that I may give information of it to 
the officers of our ports, and through them to the commanders 
of our ships of war. This measure seems to me essential, in 
order to prevent all the disputes, which might arise on this 
subject. 
</p><p>
In my last letter I assured you of the sincere desire of the 
French Republic, not only carefully to avoid whatever might 
disturb the perfect harmony between the two nations, but to 
draw more and more closely the fraternal bonds which unite 
them. You have seen proofs of this in the various decrees, 
which have been passed by the National Convention, in 
favor of the commerce of the United States. I have the 
honor to be, &c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received the letter, which you addressed to me on 
the 29th of last month. 
</p><p>
The affection of the French Republic for the United States 
is too marked to admit the possibility of an unfavorable interpretation being given to the accident, which befel you on the 
28th instant. The precautionary measures taken on that day 
extended to all the inhabitants of the city of Paris, and a proof 
that they had no reference to you personally is, that at the moment your name and rank were known, you obtained the justice due to you. 
</p><p>
The domiciliary visits were an equally general measure, 
from which no house in Paris was exempt. I see with pleasure, that the Commissaries of the Section, who entered your 
house, withdrew after the explanation you gave them. The 
respect, which they have shown you, is proof of the belief of 
my fellow citizens, that the Minister of a free nation, an ally of 
France, is incapable of receiving into his house disaffected 
persons. The exemption, which you claim, would have had 
the pernicious effect of affording the ill disposed a facility for 
calumniating your motives, in order to disturb the entire harmony, which subsists between the two nations. 
</p><p>
I herewith send the papers, which you requested me to authenticate. I have the honor to be, &c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I hasten to reply to the letter, which you did me the honor 
to write to me on the nineteenth instant. 
</p><p>
Infinitely pained at the afflicting details contained in that 
letter, I thought it my duty to communicate it immediately to 
the Comite de Salut Public, a copy of whose report I send 
herewith. You will here find a sincere expression of sentiments, which I approve, and of the opinion of the Executive 
Provisory Council. I have the honor to be, &c. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="me">LEBRUN</a>. 
</p><p>
Report of the Comite de Salut Public. 
</p><p>
The Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States has just 
exhibited complaints of a very serious nature against a violation of the right of nations, and of treaties concluded with free 
Americans. 
</p><p>
If the statements set forth therein are accurate, it is not only the interest of the Republic, but the part of honor and justice, to avenge this atrocious violation of all law, and to give 
to the captain of the Little Cherub every satisfaction, which 
is due to him. This crime is so much the more punishable , 
as the captain had sailed from Havre, for the purpose of taking 
from that place a large number of our brethren inhumanly 
driven from Spain, and thus the captures have, in his case, in 
fringed not only the laws of war, but those of hospitality and 
gratitude. 
The Minister of the United States makes complaint, also, 
that the decree of the twenty-third of May, which orders that 
ships of the United States shall not be comprised in the dispositions of that of the ninth of May, has been repealed by the 
decree of the twenty-eighth, and that a definitive report, 
which, by the terms of the decree, ought to have been made 
three days afterwards by the Comite de Salut Public, and that 
of the Marine united, has not yet been presented. The con 
sequence of this delay is, that several American vessels, and, 
among others, one with a very rich cargo, have been sequestered, to the great prejudice of the owners and masters. 
</p><p>
The Minister of Foreign Affairs thinks it his duty to insist 
strenuously on a prompt decision, concerning these complaints 
of the American Minister. He observes, that, besides the 
ties of fraternity, which unite the two nations, the Republic has 
the strongest interest to favor the free Americans, and to take 
their vessels under its special protection. The United States 
are becoming more and more the granary of France and her 
colonies ; they manifest the best dispositions to aid us ; and 
the courage which they have manifested in formally recognizing the French Republic, in spite of the menaces and intrigues 
of England, prove that their friendship for us is above all political and interested views, which might be thought to incline 
them to follow the direction which England, Spain, and Holland have vainly endeavored to give them. 
</p><p>
In view of these consideration it is evident, that the murder 
committed on board the Little Cherub ought to be severely 
punished ; that the captain should receive ample indemnity, as 
well for the loss and injury sustained on board, as for the de 
lays he experienced ; and that, in conformity with the sixteenth article of the treaty of commerce between France and 
the United States, American vessels should enjoy fully, and 
without any exception, the advantage which results from their 
neutrality, in as much as this neutrality facilitates the supplies 
of provisions to the Republic and to her colonies.
