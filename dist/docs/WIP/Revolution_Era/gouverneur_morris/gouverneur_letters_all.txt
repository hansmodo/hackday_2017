My Dear Gouverneur, 
</p><p>
I take your letter very kindly, and so am bribed on the side 
of your inclination. I could write a long letter in favor of 
your voyage. There are volumes upon the benefits of travelling. But all the world cannot have these pleasures. To 
some it would be useless to visit distant countries, others it 
would ruin. 
</p><p>
If you mean to adorn your character, I say, go. But 
considering your time of life, and the country you go to, I 
tremble at every step you are to take. Much depends upon 
your fortune. I have at times repented my confinement to 
these shores. I correct myself again upon reflecting, that if 
my industry had not been incessant, I might have been a beggar, or compelled to drudge, which is the same thing, in an 
evening hour, while those I sat out with are singing a requiem 
to their souls. 
</p><p>
Our end is happiness. Without flattery (for I a,n :-crious) 
you can support a reputation in your own country, sufficient to 
add to what you have, both by business, marriage, &,c. Your 
travels will affect the funds you possess, and if they increase 
your knowledge, perhaps they will proportionably abate your 
industry. I foresee it is ;< or never. It o r ' happens that 
we are driven to the choice of one of two tiii. . , when we 
desire both. I dare say you want both a v\ife and an estate. 
You have at least lu-d desires for both. Some take a wife and 
trust to fortune for future prosperity, and they have not been 
disappointed. But how many otherb are in misery, by venturing upon this leap ? 
</p><p>
Your reason for travelling to make friends puts me in mind 
of what I have said. I suppose you are to return, for what 
American stands a chance on the other side of the water ? 
And what is there on this side worth your acceptance, until 
age has made you indolent, and ostentatious pride gets ti.e 
better of active, and generous, and noble ambition ? 
</p><p>
I wish you had already shot the Gulph. I fear to persuade 
you to the attempt. Remember your uncle Robin.* He 
saw England thrice. No man had better advantages, either 
from nature or education. He began to figure with 30,000. 
He did not leave <a href='/results.php?year=5000'>5000</a>. I know others that never saw the 
east side of the great lake, who had no other friends than 
their own heads and their hands, to whom your uncle was 
in bonds. What! Virtus post nummos? Curse on inglorious wealth. Spare jour indignation. I too detest the ignorant miser. But both virtue and ambition abhor poverty, or 
they are mad. Rather imitate your grandfather,! than your 
uncle. The first sought preferment here, and built upon his 
American stock. The other there, and died the moment 
before the shipwreck. Is it not an Apostle, who warns us 
against the sin that easily besets us ? If this is not inspiration, 
it is good sense. Find out yours. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, I must refer you to your mother. She must spare a great deal before you can resolve with prudence. 
And when the guineas lay at your feet, think ! think ! think ! I love you with great sincerity, or I should not be so much puzzled. 
</p><p>
WILLIAM SMITH.

Dear Morris, 
</p><p>
The situation of Tryon county is both shameful and alarming. Such abject dejection and despondency, as mark the letters we have received from thence, disgrace human nature. 
God knows what to do with or for them. Were they alone 
interested in their fate, I should be for leaving their cart in the 
slough, till they would put their shoulders to the wheel. 
</p><p>
Schuyler has his enemies here, and they use these things to his disadvantage. Suspicions of his having been privy to 
the evacuation of Ticonderoga spread wide ; and twenty little circumstances, which perhaps are false, are trumped up to give 
color to the conjecture. We could wish that your letters 
might contain paragraphs for the public. We are silent, because we have nothing to say ; and the people suspect the 
worst, because we say nothing. Their curiosity must be constantly gratified, or they will be uneasy. Indeed, I do not 
wonder at their impatience, the late northern events having been 
such, as to have occasioned alarm and suspicion. I have not 
leisure to add anything more, than that I am very sincerely 
</p><p>
yours, &tc.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The day before yesterday I was favored with yours of the 
27th of August. I thank you for sympathizing with me, on 
my removal from the command in this department, at a time 
when our affairs were at the worst, and when no change could 
happen, but what must be for the better. Congress, I find, 
complain of me for painting in strong colors the situation we 
were in ; and yet, I dare say, if I had not done it, and any 
capital misfortune had happened, they would have asked why 
they had not been truly informed. But my crime consists in 
not being a New England man in principle ; and, unless they 
alter theirs, I hope I never shall be. General Gates is their 
idol, becuase he is at their direction. 
</p><p>
If an inquiry into my couduct had not been ordered, I should have resigned, the moment when Gates relieved me ; 
but, as soon as the former has taken place, I shall certainly quit. Of this I have advised Congress. I believe a certain 
set will wish, that they had not urged for an inquiry. I shall make my defence in such a manner, as that the public may 
see what has been my conduct, and what that of others ; and then they may judge for themselves ; and I trust they will 
easily discern, that the cause of our misfortunes in this department has originated, where they perhaps little expect it. 
</p><p>
When General Gates took the command, I informed him, that I had advised Congress of my intention to remain some 
time in the department, to afford him any assistance in my power, and entreated he would call upon me whenever he 
thought proper. He has, however, not done it. He sent for General Ten Broeck from town, to a council of war, but 
not for me. After that, I could not with propriety give him my opinion of what ground he ought to possess, if Burgoyne 
should retreat. What I intended to have done, had I remained in the command, and been reinforced, I fully communicated to him, and showed the orders I had given Generals Lincoln and Arnold. Hitherto he has not, as I am informed, 
made any other disposition of his force, which daily increases. 
He may certainly oblige General Burgoyne to retire immediately, or compel him to fight at a great disadvantage ; but Gates 
is totally ignorant of the country, and, although he may get people that can give him the best information, yet it falls vastly 
short of being personally well acquainted with the passes and 
defiles, which every country has more or less. From ihis defect 1 fear every advantage will not be taken that might. 
</p><p>
I am just now informed that Burgoyne has drawn all his troops from Skenesborough and Fort Anne. This, with the 
bridge he has thrown Over Hudson's river, indicates that he means to attack our army. If Lincoln is within a day's 
march of Saratoga, and is ordered that way, I wish Burgoyne may advance, and Gates too. If the latter takes post at Stillwater, Lincoln might be in the rear of Burgoyne before he 
could attack Gates ; in which case the British army must be 
totally ruined. Nor need ours apprehend a want of provisions, should Burgoyne be so posted as to render it imprudent 
to attack him ; for there are means of sending on the supplies, 
and if they escape the attention of Gates, I will point them 
out. I am, &c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
If Arnold's advice had been pursued, the enemy would have 
been routed on the twentieth of last month, and the fortification below would, in all probability, not have been attacked. 
The same want of vigor has taken place, after the action of the 
seventh instant. Burgoyne retreated on the eighth, at night ; 
was followed by an inferior body on the afternoon of the ninth ; 
and now occupies the heights between the barracks at Saratoga and Fishkill, with a dispirited army of less than five thousand ; whilst General Gates's army of fifteen thousand are looking at him ; for the General, by all accounts, has never yet 
been within ken of the enemy. This may be prudent, it is 
not very gallant. He knows Burgoyne cannot retreat, and 
will, therefore, not risk an engagement. But if Clinton should 
be able to push up to this place, the tables may be turned upon him. I hope that, however, will not be the case. 
</p><p>
Saratoga is destroyed. I expected it would be so. I 
wrote you, or the Speaker so, some days ago. I hear Gates 
intends to write Burgoyne on the subject of his devastations. 
</p><p>
I fear he will not succeed better than in his former correspondence. I am yours,

Valley Forge, May 18th, <a href='/results.php?year=1778' rel="origin">1778</a>. 
</p><p>
My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
As the council held at this place was by order of Congress, 
and the members constituting it were pointed out by them, it 
was determined, out of respect to that body, to treat the new 
members with civility. Indeed the wish of all here, that no 
private differences should interrupt that harmony, which is so 
essential in public councils, had no small share in the amity 
that appeared. Contrary, I own, to my expectation, the same 
sentiments, respecting the measures to be pursued, pervaded 
the whole. Our resolutions of consequence were unanimous. 
</p><p>
I was not a little surprised to find a gentleman, who, sometime ago, when a cloud of darkness hung heavy over us, and 
our offairs looked gloomy, was desirous of resigning, to be now stepping forward in the line of the army. But, if he can 
reconcile such conduct to his feelings, as an officer and man of honor, and Congress have no objections to his leaving his seat in 
another department, I have nothing personally to oppose to it. Yet I must think, that gentlemen stepping in and out, as the 
sun happens to beam forth or be obscured, is not quite the thing, nor quite just with respect to those officers, who take 
the bitter with the sweet. 
</p><p>
I am told that Conway, from whom I have received another impertinent letter, dated the 23d ultimo, demanding the 
command of a division of the continental army, is, through the medium of his friends, soliciting his commission again. Can 
this be ? And if so, will it be granted ? I am very sincerely and affectionately,

GENERAL WASHINGTON TO MR MORRIS. 
</p><p>
White Plains, July 24th, <a href='/results.php?year=1778' rel="origin">1778</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Whether you are indebted to me, or I to you, for a letter, I know not, nor is it a matter of much moment. The design of 
this is to touch, cursorily, upon a subject of very great importance to the well-being of these States ; much more so than 
will appear at first view. I mean the appointment of so many foreigners to offices of high rank and trust in our service. 
</p><p>
The lavish manner, in which rank has hitherto been bestowed on these gentlemen, will certainly be productive of 
one or the other of these two evils, either to make it despicable in the eyes of Europe, or become a means of pouring 
them in upon you like a torrent, and adding to your present 
burden. But it is neither the expense nor trouble of them 
that I most dread. There is an evil more extensive in its nature, and fatal in its consequences, to be apprehended, and that 
is, the driving of all your own officers out of the service, and 
throwing not only your army, but your military councils, entirely into the hands of foreigners. 
</p><p>
The officers, my dear Sir, on whom you must depend for 
the defence of this cause, and who, from length of service, their 
connexions, property, and, in behalf of many, I may add, military merit, will not submit much if any longer to the unnatural 
promotion of men over them, who have nothing more than a 
little plausibility, unbounded pride and ambition, and a perseverance in application not to be resisted but by uncommon 
firmness, to support their pretensions ; men, who, in the first 
instance, tell you they wish for nothing more than the honor 
of serving in so glorious a cause as volunteers, the next day 
solicit rank without pay, the day following want money advanced to them, and in the course of a week want further promotion, and are not satisfied with anything you can do for them. 
</p><p>
When I speak of officers not submitting to these appointments, let me be understood to mean, that they have no more 
doubt of their right to resign, when they think themselves aggrieved, than they have of a power in Congress to appoint. 
Both being granted, then, the expediency and the policy of the 
measure remain to be considered, and whether it is consistent 
with justice or prudence to promote these military fortune hunters, at the hazard of your army. They maybe divided into 
throe classes, viz. mere adventurers without recommendation, 
or recommended by persons, who do not know how else to dispose of or provide for them ; men of great ambition, who 
would sacrifice everything to promote their own personal glory ; 
or mere spies, who are sent here to obtain a thorough knowledge of our situation and circumstances, in the execution of 
which, I am persuaded, some of them are faithful emissaries, 
as I do not believe a single matter escapes unnoticed, or unadvised at a foreign court. 
</p><p>
I could say a great deal on this subject, but will add no 
more at present. I am led to give you this trouble at this time, 
by a very handsome certificate showed me yesterday in favor 
of M. Neuville, written (I believe) by himself, and subscribed 
by General Parsons, designed, as I am informed, for a foundation of the superstructure of a brigadiership. 
</p><p>
Baron Steuben, I now find, is also wanting to quit his inspectorship for a, command in the line. This will be productive of much discontent to the brigadiers. In a word, although I think the Baron an excellent officer, I do most devoutly wish, that we had not a single foreigner among us, except the Marquis de Lafayette, who acts upon very different 
principles from those which govern the rest. Adieu. I 
am most sincerely yours, 
</p><p>
GEORGE WASHINGTON.

Office of Finance, July 6th, <a href='/results.php?year=1781' rel="origin">1781</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The cheerful manner in which you agreed to render me the 
assistance I solicited, soon after my appointment to the superintendency of the Finances of the United States, gave me great 
pleasure on my own account, and a still more solid satisfaction 
on account of my country. Depending solely on myself, I 
trembled at the arduous task I had reluctantly undertaken ; 
aided by your talents and abilities I feel better courage, and 
dare indulge the fond hope, that, uniting our utmost exertions 
in the service of our country, we may be able to extricate it 
from the present embarrassments, and dispel those only clouds, 
that seem to hang destructive over it. 
</p><p>
The honorable Congress, by their act of this date, have 
fixed a salary for the assistant, whom I may appoint, agreeable 
to the powers annexed to my office by a former act of Congress. My entire conviction of the great and essential services, which your genius, talents, and capacity enable you to 
render to your country, and of that aid, ease, and confidence 
you can and will administer to my own exertions and feelings, 
never left me one moment to hesitate about the choice I should 
make. I only lament, that the provision allowed by Congress is not more adequate to your deserts, but as I know you are 
incapable of mercenary views and considerations, this circumstance shall be overlooked for the present, in expectation that 
the utility of our measures may draw a proper attention from 
those, who employ us. At any rate we will have the consolation to pursue the interest of the United States to the best of 
our judgment and abilities, whether we meet with suitable 
rewards or not. 
</p><p>
Therefore, it is with the utmost satisfaction, that 1 do hereby appoint you assistant to the Superintendent of the Finances 
of the United States of North America, and I do assure you, 
that nothing will make me more happy, than to acquire and divide with you the thanks of our country, and applause of the 
world ; for I am, with esteem and affection, your sincere friend 
and obedient servant,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The subject of your letter by Major Edwards is important to the public, and interesting to the army. The disposition of the latter here is much the same as it is to the northward, but I am afraid of both. When soldiers advance without authority, who can halt them? We have many Clodiuses and Catilines in America, who may give a different direction 
to this business, than either you or I expect. It is a critical 
business, and pregnant with dangerous consequences. Congress arc fast declining, and their po.ver and authority must expire, without more effectual support. What this may produce, 
time will manifest. I have done my duty, and wait events. 
</p><p>
I wrote a letter to the Governor of this State on the subject of finance, and the discontents of the army. It gave some 
alarm and much disgust. Continental authority and the financier are looked upon with a jealous eye here. No people 
were ever more blind to their true interest. Time and further 
experience will produce what reason and persuasion cannot. I send you a copy of my letter to the Assembly, and a 
couple of papers with some strictures thereon. More will he 
said upon the subject hereafter. Plain dealing will soon become necessary. 
</p><p>
Within a day a report prevails that Mr Morris will resign 
in May. Public credit will receive a fatal stab should it take 
place. No more bills can be negotiaied, and I expect the 
contractor will decline the business. How we are to be supported I cannot imagine. Every mind seems to be impressed with a kind of awful suspense. The doubis upon war and 
peace, the hopes and fears in matters of revenue, the discontenis ol the army, and the consequences that all these may produce upon our own internal policy, and in the measures of 
British administration, must fill every mind, which feels for 
the tranquillity of this country, with no small anxiety. Most 
part of the force in this quarter will march northwardly in 
about a fortnight. I am, &c.

</p><p>
My Dear Morris, 
</p><p>
I thank you for your kind favor of the seventh instant by Colonel Brooks. I am convinced your ideas of the general 
state of our affairs must be just, as they are the result of experience. The army generally have always reprobated being thirteen armies. Their ardent desires have been, to be 
one continental body ; looking up to one sovereign. This would have prevented much heart-burning at the partialities, which have been practised by the respective States. They know of 
no way of bringing this about, at a period when peace appears to be in full view. Certain it is, they are good patriots and would forward everything, that would tend to produce union, 
and a permanent general constitution. But they are yet to be taught how their influence is to effect this matter. They may assist, but they must be directed in the mode by proper authority. 
</p><p>
It is a favorite toast in the army, " a hoop to the barrel," or, " cement to the union." America will have fought and bled to little purpose, if the powers of government shall be insufficient to preserve the peace, and this must be the case without general funds. As the present constitution is so defective, why do not you great men call the people together, and tell 
them so. That is, to have a convention of the States to form a better constitution ? This appears to us, who have a superficial view only, to be the most efficacious remedy. Let something be done before a peace takes place, or we shall be in a worse situation than we were at the commencement of the war.

My dear Friend, 
</p><p>
You have been acquainted with the atrocious events, 
which have taken place in Paris, when the Jacobin faction oil 
the tenth of August overthrew the Constitution, enslaved both 
the Assembly and the King, the one by terror, the other by 
destitution and confinement, and gave a signal for pillage and 
massacre. 
</p><p>
I could have found a high station in the new order of 
things, without even having meddled with the plot. But my 
feelings did not admit of such an idea. I raised an opposition 
to Jacobin tyranny ; but you know the weakness of our Aonnetes gens. I was abandoned ; the army gave way to clubish 
acts. Nothing was left for me but to leave France. We 
have been stopped on our road and detained by. an Austrian 
detachment, which is absolutely contrary to the droits des gens, 
as may appear from the enclosed Declaration, which I request 
you to have published. You will greatly oblige me, my dear 
friend, by setting out for Brussels as soon as this reaches you, 
and insist on seeing me. I am an American citizen, an 
American officer, no more in the French service. That is 
your right, and I do not doubt of your urgent and immediate arrival.

Paris, September 12th, <a href='/results.php?year=1792' rel="origin">1792</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The situation of M. de Lafayette I have long lamented, and since these last disasters, I feel more than ever a desire 
to alleviate his distress. I had already meditated on the circumstances in which he might be placed, and his imprisonment 
was among those events, which appeared not improbable. 
The enemy may consider him as a prisoner of war, as a deserter, or as a spy. In the first capacity he might be delivered 
up, to be sacrificed by his countrymen ; in the last he might 
be made the victim of resentment, excited by his former conduct. As a deserter, he is entitled to protection, but I doubt 
whether he would choose to be so protected. 
</p><p>
I incline, however, to the opinion, that the enemy mean to use him in a different capacity, and that his future treatment 
will depend entirely on himself; but at the same time, I fear that the employment they would give him, is not such as he 
will choose to engage in. Be all this, however, as it may, he 
is in their power, and they will do as they please. The reasons you urge for his liberation are cogent, and I hope they 
will be attended to ; but power sometimes makes law for itself, and in such cases, it cares but little for history or posterity. 
</p><p>
Supposing that M. de Lafayette were a natural born subject of America, and taken under the circumstances in which 
he was placed, I do not exactly see how the United States could claim him. He was not in their service. If he had 
been made a prisoner of war, could they claim him as their citizen? Tf claimed and delivered up, would they not be bound 
to put him to death, for having attacked a neutral power, or else, by the very act of acquitting him, declare war against 
those who had taken him ? Can the United States interfere in an affair of this sort, without making themselves parties in 
the quarrel ? But M. de Lafayette is a Frenchman, and it is as a Frenchman, that he is taken and is to be treated. 
Again, supposing the right as clear as it is questionable, I presume that before the United States made such demand, they 
would determine to go all lengths to establish their right, in 
case it should be refused ; for otherwise by advancing the 
claim, and then receding, they would sit down quietly under 
an insult. Consequently they would consider well, before 
they placed themselves in a situation to be dishonored, or else 
drawn into a war. 
</p><p>
These are points of such magnitude, that I do not feel myself competent to decide on them, in behalf of my country ; 
and, therefore, if I were Minister to his Imperial Majesty, I 
should, I think, confine myself to prayer and solicitation, until 
I received express orders from the President of the United 
States. But as I am not Minister to the Emperor, I rather 
think that my interference would prove offensive, and do more 
harm than good to Monsieur de Lafayette. And not only 
the Emperor, and perhaps the King of Prussia too, might complain, if they thought it worth while to take any notice of such 
unauthorized application ; but the government of this country, 
also, might feel itself offended, and that in either of those 
events, which are now at the issue of the sword. If there was, 
however, any probability that a demand on our part would 
liberate him, it might be well to attempt it. You may perhaps 
find out how that matter stands, through the medium of the 
Court at which you are, and this it would, I think, be well to 
do. If the Austrian Ministry should wish an excuse to deliver 
him from bondage, they may admit of that which you mention, but certainly they will not consider it as a reason. I am,

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Among the afflicting considerations, which have impressed 
themselves on my mind, from the moment I heard of the misfortune of our friend and fellow-citizen, the Marquis Lafayette, 
none have affected me with such painful sensations, as the 
conviction, that no exertions of his American friends can be 
of utility to him in his present situation ; and since the receipt 
of your favor of the seventh, which did not reach me till yesterday, this subject has scarcely been a moment out of my 
thoughts. But I search in vain for some foundation whereon 
to establish a right to demand his liberation; and to demand 
it with a certainty of refusal, and with a consciousness, that 
such refusal may be founded on principles of propriety, would, 
without benefitting our friend, commit our country and ourselves. 
</p><p>
I feel myself, however, so much interested in this business, 
that it will afford me real pleasure to find that Mr Morris, or 
you, upon more mature reflection, have devised any plan to 
which my concurrence can add efficacy. And in order to 
evince the readiness, with which I contribute my endeavors to 
strike out some expedient, which may be serviceable, I venture to enclose for the deliberation of Mr Morris and yourself 
a rough sketch of a note, to which, however, I perceive forcible objections ; and only submit it as the least exceptionable 
of such ideas, as have suggested themselves to me. A claim 
of the rights of an American citizen, to a person in the Mafquis's eircumstances, appears to me to be claiming nothing, 
and it can only, I fear, at best, serve as a testimonial of national 
gratitude, and may be a consolatory tribute to the feelings of a 
man, of whose services and zeal for our country there is I believe but one sentiment in America. If a measure of that, or 
any other nature, should be adopted, it ought, I conceive, to be 
so conducted as to avoid involving any discussion of principle, 
and should be the joint act of all the American Ministers in 
Europe, if distance of situation will permit their uniting in the 
time necessary to render it serviceable. I am, &tc.

I have no right to take this step in addressing you. I esteem you most highly, but who would not esteem you ? I

country. What greater service can any one render to his 
native land, than to discharge her obligations of gratitude ? 
Is there any severer calamity, than that which has befallen 
Lafayette ? Does any more glaring injustice attract the attention of Europe ? I speak to you of glory, yet I know a 
more elevated sentiment is the motive of your conduct. 
</p><p>
The unhappy wife of M. de Lafayette has sent a message, 
in which she begs her friends to apply to him, who has already 
been her preserver. I had no difficulty in recognising you, 
under this veil. In this period of terror, there are a thousand 
virtues, by which they, who fear to pronounce your name, 
may distinguish you. For myself, who am more afflicted, I 
believe, than any one, by the fate of M. de Lafayette, I shall 
not have the presumption to imagine, that my solicitations can 
influence you in his favor. But you cannot prevent me from 
admiring you, nor from feeling as grateful to you, as if you had 
granted to myself alone that, which humanity, your own glory, and both worlds expect of you.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
The place where your letter was written, is enough to give 
me some hope. It is impossible you should be there without 
succeeding. Such glory is reserved for you, and there is none 
more delightful, or more brilliant, for you, or for any man. 
It is possible the opposition may have been indiscreet. But 
could the unfortunate man, of whom they spoke, have solicited 
it of them ? It appears certain, that his wife was kindly received by the Emperor; that he permitted her to write to him, 
and that he has never received her letters. Humane and just, 
as we are assured he is, would he have suffered the wife and 
children to be treated in the same manner ? The wife and 
children ! What a reward for such a noble self devotion ! It 
is as cruel, as the condition from which you once before saved 
her. What do they expect ? Do they wish that the earliest 
enemies of the unhappy man should be roused to claim, that a 
period should be put to his misfortunes ? That they should imitate the demand of the Romans from the Carthagenians ? It 
seems to me, if you were to speak for a single hour to those, 
on whom his fate depends, all would be well. I have such 
experience of your influence over opinions, which were even 
opposed to your own, that I am tempted to ask, what effect 
would you not produce, were you to lend your intelligence and 
talent to second the persuasions of interest ? Should you ask 
this, as the reward of your counsels, could it be refused ? 
</p><p>
In short, the idea that this calamity may be terminated, 
that it may be terminated by your exertions, this idea excites 
in me so much emotion, that, without disguising to myself the 
indiscretion of a second letter, I could not deny myself the 
expression of this belief, which arises as much from admiration of you, as from pity for him.

Ploen, Holsteln, November 27th, <a href='/results.php?year=1796' rel="origin">1796</a>.
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
My sister is in danger of losing the life you saved in the prisons of Paris. Her tenderness and duty have conducted 
her, with her daughters, to that of Olmutz, where the utter privation of salubrious air has sensibly impaired the springs of 
life. Her husband, attacked by a disorder in the chest, will soon yield, perhaps, to the slow fever, which is consuming 
him ; and the tender children will see the authors of their being, whom they came to serve and console, perish before their eyes. 
</p><p>
Madame de Lafayette has solicited permission to go and 
pass a few days at Vienna, in order to consult a physician 
there. This was not only refused her, but she was positively 
assured, that if she left her husband's prison a moment, she 
could never return. The only alternative allowed her was to abandon him, or to partake all the hardships of his captivity. 
Her choice was not doubtful. She consented to breathe only the infected air of the place where he is confined, and to 
give thanks for the privilege allowed her. 
</p><p>
I have taken the liberty to address a letter to the Emperor, to denounce to him the cruelties, of which everything attests his ignorance, because, after having honored my sister 
with the kindest reception, he condescended to assure her, 
that her husband was well treated, while his keepers obstinate. ly refused, for two years, to answer his questions respecting 
the existence of his wife and children. My remonstrance has 
remained unanswered. Has not he, whom Europe numbers 
among those citizens of whom North America ought to be 
most proud, has not he the right to make himself heard in favor of a citizen of the United States, and of a wife, whose life 
belongs to him, since he has preserved it? Yes, without 
doubt, and it is in this confidence, that I solicit your aid 
with the Emperor and the Austrian Ministry, and that I come 
to you to seek the hope and comfort so necessary to the 
wretched. 
</p><p>
My gratitude is already yours by so many titles, that to feel 
assured of it, Sir, you need only see the signature of your 
most humble servant,

Breragarten, Switzerland, January 27th <a href='/results.php?year=1795' rel="origin">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have seen in Switzerland the young Duke of Orleans. 
He has had a serious quarrel with Madame de Sillery, from 
whom he has received very bad treatment. But say nothing 
of this, for if she knew he divulged it, she would persecute 
him even in his concealment. He is now entirely estranged 
from her and her principles, and has even taken his sister from 
her charge, and put her under the care of the Princess de Conti, his aunt. 
</p><p>
Since he left the army his conduct in regard to his mother 
has been perfect. When he arrived with Dumouriez at the 
Austrian army, the Archduke and the Prince of Coburg proposed to him to enter into the service of the Emperor, retaining his rank and appointments of lieutenant general. He refused, although without money, and without knowing what 
would become of himself, telling them that he was unwilling 
to expose his mother and brothers, and that he could not serve 
against his country. He immediately departed, in company 
with an aid-de-camp, and travelled through Germany in a 
miserable little cabriolet. Being persecuted in Switzerland by 
the extreme partisans both of Aristocracy and of Jacobinism, 
he separated from his aid-de-camp, and, with a single servant, who followed him from the time of his emigration, (the same who courageously gave his horse to Dumouriez) he 
wandered on foot among the mountains, spending no more 
than thirty sous a day for the food, lodging, and other necessaries required by them both. 
</p><p>
At length, not having more than thirty francs in the world, 
he returned to M. de Montesquieu, who afforded him relief, 
and found a place for him as a professor in a college, where 
he taught geometry in the German language, without its ever 
being known, either to the masters or scholars, who he was. 
So much was he beloved in this situation, that M, de Salis, 
(a violent Aristocrat, of great influence in Switzerland, and 
who would have driven him away if he had known him,) was 
struck with the deportment of the young professor, and offered him the place of preceptor to his children. When I spoke 
to him of this retreat, he said to me, that he would willingly 
die for his mother and brothers, and he believed the more he 
kept himself concealed, the greater would be the chance of 
their safety. I am well persuaded, if he had pursued any other conduct, the horrible Robespierre would have massacred 
them all. In his manner of dress, he adopts the habit of his 
ancestor, Henry the Fourth. He is melancholy, but gentle 
and unassuming, and his whole ambition is to go to your 
America, there to forget the grandeur and the sufferings of his 
youth. But he has nothing in the world. Can you not render him the double service of acquainting his mother with his 
conduct, his veneration for her, and his hatred of Madame de 
Sillery, who ruined his father, (c[ui a perdu son pere;) and 
also of informing him whether his mother has the means of 
subsistence, where are his brothers, and any little details respecting the situation of them all? He remembers having 
seen you, and says he was then so completely under the control of the false principles and prejudices of his governess, that 
you could not judge of him, but that he hopes so excellent a 
friend of his mother will not refuse to be his. Do you know 
that Madame de Sillery is at Hamburg, with M. de Valence 
and her niece ? Adieu.

Bremgarten, February 24th, <a href='/results.php?year=1795' rel="origin">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
A thousand thanks for your kind and consoling letter of the 
sixth instant. I shall depart as soon as possible. Think not 
that it will be with the delay, that I should return to Paris. I 
have only happiness now in prospect, and no guillotine to fear. 
My cousin will go with me ; but it is necessary, that you should 
know his situation. Hamburg is full of people, to whom he is 
known, and whom he would wish never again to see. In the 
first place, Madame de Sillery is at Altona, and out of respect 
to his mother he desires to avoid her. Moreover, he cares 
not to embroil himself with so mischievous a person, for a writer like her is always to be dreaded. Her books are full of 
cruel detractions against all the persons, to whom she is under 
the highest obligations. Again, there is General Valence 
three leagues from Hamburg, with a niece of Madame de Sillery. And then a certain M. Rivry, aid-de-camp of M. de 
Valence, is at Hamburg. Independently of the regards, which 
my cousin entertains for his family, he has personal reasons 
for desiring never to meet any one of these people. 
</p><p>
You see, therefore, my friend, it will be necessary for him 
to have a little retreat quite secluded. And as for me, the 
smallest lodge, far away from the town, will be most agreeable, for I have absolute need of air, and my strength will not 
allow me to go far to seek it. Besides, the more I shall be 
retired, the more incognito will my cousin remain. But 
above all things shun Altona. 
</p><p>
I must also give you some account of the pecuniary situation of my cousin. His father had many transactions with 
Walekiers, and he is the only agent, who has treated him with 
fidelity. All the others plundered and deceived him. There 
are even now in England two deposits amounting to thirtyfive thousand pounds sterling, of which no account can be obtained. He intends to prosecute the affair ; and there are many other particulars respecting these plunderers, of which I am 
not permitted to write. Walekiers alone has been perfectly 
generous and disinterested. So far from being indebted to his 
father, he is his creditor ; and yet, he now sends him a remittance of twenty-five louis a month, to be returned when he 
shall again come into possession of his property. After this, 
you will see, that it is impossible to keep Walekiers ignorant 
either of his retreat, or his journey. But, he is the only person, who will be informed of them. Hence you can converse 
with him or not on the subject, as you may think proper. He 
desires not to lodge with Walekiers, on account of the company he would meet there, although Walekiers has made him 
every possible offer to receive him at his house. But he 
wishes to associate with a man of reputation, like you, the 
friend of his mother. You will understand all this better, when 
we shall have an opportunity to converse. 
</p><p>
It will be fifteen days before T shall be able to commence 
the journey. In that time I must send your bill of exchange 
to be negotiated at Basle, for such a thing cannot be done in 
this small village. A carriage is also to be repaired for my 
cousin, but that will not take long, as it is almost new. We 
shall then set off, I and my English servant woman, and he 
and the faithful servant, of whom 1 have spoken. Adieu, my 
excellent friend ; I cannot find words to express how sensib'e 
</p><p>
I am of your goodness. 
</p><p>
THE COUNTESS DE FLAHAUT.
</p><p>
P. S. The twenty -five louis a month from Walekiers 
have only commenced since his arrival in Hamburg, that is to 
say, within a month, and may be stopped at any moment, 
since they depend on the fortune and the will of M. WaleThe enclosed letter is from my cousin.'

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I accept with much pleasure the offers you make me. Your kindness is a blessing I owe to my mother, and to our 
friend. I am sure, that my excellent mother will be somewhat 
consoled, and more tranquil, to know that I am near you, in 
your happy country. I am very ready to labor to acquire independence. Hardly had I entered upon life, when the greatest misfortunes assailed me, but, thanks to God, they did not 
overwhelm me, too happy in my reverses, that my youth 
had not given me time to become too much attached to my 
station, or to contract habits difficult to be broken, and that I 
was deprived of my fortune before I could either use or 
abuse it. 
</p><p>
Your excellent friend has the goodness to undertake to 
send you many particulars respecting my present condition, 
which are tedious enough, but of which you ought to be informed. I hope, Sir, my confidence will afford you another 
proof of all those sentiments of esteem and friendship, which 
you inspire in me.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
You see by the place where I date my letter, that I have 
not resisted the temptation of visiting Sweden. It was not easy to pass so near this kingdom, without making the tour of it, 
and I do not repeni doing so, for in a commercial view, this 
city merits the attention of a traveller. 
</p><p>
I felt much joy on my arrival, in finding a little billet from my mother, which she sent me through the channel of a French 
Priest, a refugee in Switzerland, whom I believe I have mentioned to you. By the same opportunity she wrote a charming letter to my sister, of which I received a copy. This Abbe sent me word, at the same time, that my mother is very much 
better, and that her health improves daily. I have heard from my little sister, who is also much hetter. Pardon, I pray you, 
these details. I give them to you, only because I know the 
strong interest you take in everything, that relates to my honored mother. Believe me, Sir, it is impossible to feel more 
deeply than I do, the lively concern which you are so kind as 
to take in my fate ; and, I pray you, receive my assurances of 
the very ardent and sincere affection, with which you inspire me.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just received a letter from my mother, which orders 
me to undertake a voyage to your country, and announces to 
me, that this voyage will ameliorate her situation and that of 
my connexions. I shall therefore depart with all haste. My 
brothers, too, will sail for Philadelphia. This is certain, for 
the Directory sent me officially my mother's letter, and of 
course had knowledge of it. 
</p><p>
I have already informed you, that I wrote to Mr Parish to 
ask him to give my sister a letter of credit for three hundred 
pounds, out of the fifteen hundred. He sent me word that 
the sum, which he then had at my disposal was only four hundred pounds, that he could not deliver it in small sums, nor 
without my receipt. Consequently I sent him my receipt for 
four hundred pounds. I have transmitted one hundred to my 
sister, and kept three hundred for myself. I shall set off immediately for Hamburg, where I shall embark in the first vessel. Adieu. I have little time, and embrace you in great 
haste.

</p><p>
Sir 
</p><p>
I once more answer your letter of May 11th, fearing that 
my former communications have not reached you. As I receive no letters from Hamburg, I have reason to think this 
will have the same fate. For the rest, I cannot say enough to you of the obliging reception we have met with from your friends. 
</p><p>
We owe you many thanks, and we return them to you 
most cordially, for the credit you have been pleased to give us 
here. You are undoubtedly informed, that we have availed 
ourselves of it for the sum of three thousand dollars, which, added to one of a thousand dollars, taken up at the time I received 
your letter, amounts to four thousand dollars, for which we are indebted to your kindness. 
</p><p>
I can no longer congratulate you, as I did a short time since, on the good news we received. It has all passed away 
like a dream. In the midst of this general calamity, We have at least the consolation, the satisfaction, of knowing, that our 
beloved mother is away from that wretched country, and safe from all danger. This alone is a full compensation for all the 
rest. She will certainly feel deeply your conduct towards us, and will doubtless do all that is requisite to discharge our debt 
to you. Adieu. Ever yours,
