</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I should not have so long delayed returning an answer to 
the letter you received from <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel=''>General Washington</a>, which you 
had the goodness to communicate to me last month, had I not 
heard you were in Holland. I received some time ago a 
note from you, which I should soon have acknowledged, but 
was at first prevented by a multiplicity of engagements, and 
since by illness. 
</p><p>
The two subjects contained in <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel=''>General Washington's</a> letter 
are indisputably of the highest importance, and I can safely 
assure you, that it has ever been the sincere and earnest wish 
of this country to fulfil her engagements (contracted by the 
treaty of peace) with the United States, in a manner consistent with the most scrupulous fidelity. 
</p><p>
We cannot but lament every circumstance, which can have 
delayed the accomplishment of those engagements, (comprised 
in the treaty) to which those States were in the most 
solemn manner bound ; and, should the delay in fulfilling them 
have rendered their final completion impracticable, we have 
no scruple in declaring our object is, to retard the fulfilling 
such subsequent parts of the treaty as depend entirely upon 
Great Britain, until redress is granted to our subjects upon the 
specific points of the treaty itself, or a fair and just compensation obtained for the non-performance of those engagements 
on the part of the United States. 
</p><p>
With respect to a commercial treaty between the two 
countries, I can only say, that it is the sincere wish of the 
British government to cultivate a real and bond fide system of 
friendly intercourse with the United States ; and that every 
measure, which can tend really and reciprocally to produce 
that object, will be adopted with the utmost satisfaction by 
Great Britain. 
</p><p>
I am, Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just received the honor of your letter of this day's 
date. I well remember the nature of the conversation you allude 
to, as well as the particular points upon which the two countries mutually complain of a non-observance of treaty. Each 
party may perhaps have reason for complaint. I can assure you, 
Sir, 1 sincerely lament it. I am not entering into a ministerial 
discussion upon the subject of our not being already further advanced, in what we are both interested in, a real bond fide intercourse of friendship, but am only acknowledging, confidentially, my own private opinion, and what it has not been hitherto in 
my power to remedy. 
</p><p>
I shall, I trust, be enabled very soon to address myself upon 
a new subject to <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel=''>General Washington</a> ; and in the mean time, 
shall be very happy to see you, Sir, before your departure for 
America. I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.
