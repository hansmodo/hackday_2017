Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have thoughts of sailing for London in the Miller, and I beg your sentiments with the same candor, that I deliver my 
own. I shall pay most regard to your advice, because I believe it will be dictated by friendship, and founded on a more intimate knowledge of me than I possess. 
</p><p>
The advantages I expect from a twelve months' sojourning in England are shortly these. I hope to form some acquaintances, that may hereafter be of service to me, to model 
myself after some persons, who cut a figure in the profession 
of the law, to form my manners and address by the example of 
the truly polite, to rub off in the gay circle a few of those many barbarisms, which characterize a provincial education, and 
to curb that vain self sufficiency, which arises from comparing 
ourselves with companions who are inferior to us. As this 
last is the most agreeable, so it is the most dangerous kind of 
flattery, the surest source of vanity, a disease which can be 
cured only by conversing with our superiors in understanding. 
</p><p>
There are many dangers, which it is alleged attend a 
young man thrown from under his parents' wings upon the 
gay stage of pleasure and dissipation, where a wanton circle 
of delusive joys courts his acquaintance, and an endless variety of objects prevents satiety and removes disgust ; and to all 
the trite observations that may be made on this subject in the 
present instance, perhaps it may be added, that I have naturally a taste for pleasure, and, if it be allowed that I have a 
taste for pleasure, it may naturally follow that I shall avoid 
those low pleasures, which abound in as great an exuberance 
on this as on the other side of the Atlantic. As for those 
poignant joys, which are the lot of the affluent, like Tantalus 
I may grasp at them, but they will certainly be out of my 
reach. I might go farther and make my observations more 
particular, but as Lord Bacon told the Commons, with respect 
to his Majesty's power and prerogative, these things are better 
to be imagined by you than expressed by me. 
</p><p>
I desire, however, that you will consider how much better my time may now be spared than hereafter. I have somehow or other been so hurried through the different scenes of 
childhood and youth, that I have still some time left to pause 
before I tread the great stage of life, and you know how much 
our conduct there depends upon the mode of our education. 
After what I have said, it will be needless to add, that my inclinations have taken part in this debate. However, believe 
me, my doubts and hopes have agreed to make you their arbiter, and there is a rule of submission entered in the court of 
conscience. I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am confident you will not attribute my silence to a want of respect or regard, for I am sure you have a better opinion of me than to imagine I should fail in either towards you. 
In good truth, I know of nothing worth your attention. News 
we have not any, at least not more than the gazettes will promulgate to the listening ear of attentive inquiry. I beg Mr Rivingston's pardon for encroaching on his style. Politics I dislike, and only look on with pity, while the madness of so 
many is made the gain of so few, exclaiming with poor Hamlet, " What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba?" Religion the very word demands respect, and, as B says of his wife, 
</p><p>
I speak of her with reverence. Love as dull as a tale 
twice told. Friendship gone to pay Astraea a visit : her votaries so few that the world knows them not. Business has so transformed, and transmigrated, and almost transubstantiated me, as hardly to leave the memory of what I was. But 
you are not a son of care ; smoothly then may your minutes 
flow. May the table of life be spread before you with uncloying variety ; and chiefly may you be free from that listless 
vacuity of mind, which admonishes us that man was intended 
for an active being. Pray how does that honest man of the heroic age, General Lee ? I suppose he gave a loud plaudit to the Boston wights. 
</p><p>
Here follows a word to Mrs Penn. 
</p><p>
Dear Madam, 
</p><p>
What a terrible life do I lead. Worse than at Philadelphia. There I was all night up it is true, but it was in company, making merry. Here up all night writing, and like his 
grace the Duke of C. " nobody with me but myself." Pity 
it is you are not here balls, concerts, assemblies all of us 
mad in the pursuit of pleasure. Not a pause. Grave phizes 
are grinned out of countenance, prudence kicked out of doors, 
and your sober, solid, sedate friend, (myself meaning) is become the butt of unfledged witlings. Mr Griffin is here. 
How does your neighbor's family ? Bless us, what a foolish question. You live at too great a distance to know. Lady 
Dunmore is here a very elegant woman. She looks, and speaks, and moves, and is, a lady. Her daughters are fine, 
sprightly, sweet girls. Goodness of heart flushes from them in every look. How is it possible, said that honest soul our 
Governor to me, how is it possible my Lord Dunmore could so long deprive himself of those pleasures he must enjoy in such 
a family.? When you see them you will feel the full force of this observation. 
</p><p>
Let me beg you to make my respects acceptable to your 
family, and to believe that I am really your friend, 
</p><p>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You have heard, and you will hear, a great deal about politics, and in the heap of chaff you may find some grains of 
good sense. Believe me, Sir, freedom and religion are only watch words. We have appointed a Committee, or rather we 
have nominated one. Let me give you the history of it. It is needless to premise, that the lower orders of mankind are 
more easily led by specious appearances, than those of a more exalted station. This and many similar propositions you 
know better than your humble servant. 
</p><p>
The troubles in America during Grenville's administration 
put our gentry upon this finesse. They stimulated some daring coxcombs to rouse the mob into an attack upon the bounds 
of order and decency. These fellows became the Jack Cades of the day, the leadernrin all riots, the belwethers of the flock. 
The reason of the manoeuvre in those, who wished to keep fair with government, and at the same time to receive the incense 
of popular applause, you will readily perceive. On the whole, the shepherds were not much to blame in a politic point of 
view. The belwethers jingled merrily, and roared out liberty, and property, and religion, and a multitude of cant terms, 
which every one thought he understood, and was egregiously 
mistaken. For you must know the shepherds kept the dictionary of the day, and like the mysteries of the ancient mythology, it was not for profane eyes or ears. This answered 
many purposes ; the simple flock put themselves entirely under the protection of these most excellent shepherds. By and 
bye behold a great metamorphosis, without the help of Ovid or 
his divinities, but entirely effectuated by two modern genii, the 
god of ambition and the goddess of faction. The first of 
these prompted the shepherds to shear some of their flock, 
and then, in conjunction with the other, converted the belwethers into shepherds. That we have been in hot water 
with the British Parliament ever since, every body knows. 
Consequently these new shepherds had their hands full of employment. The old ones kept themselves least in sight, and a 
want of confidence in each other was not the least evil which 
followed. The port of Boston has been shut up. These 
sheep, simple as they are, cannot be gulled as heretofore. In 
short, there is no ruling them ; and now, to leave the metaphor, 
the heads of the mobility grow dangerous to the gentry, and 
how to keep them down is the question^ While they correspond with the other colonies, call and dismiss popular assemblies, make resolves to bind the consciences of the rest of 
mankind, bully poor printers, and exert with full force all their 
other tribunitial powers, it is impossible to curb them. 
</p><p>
But art sometimes goes farther than force, and therefore to 
trick them handsomely a committee of patricians was to be 
nominated, and into their hands was to be committed [he majesty of the people, and the highest trust was to be reposed in 
them by a mandate, that they should take care, quod respublica non capiat injuriam. The tribunes, through want of a 
good legerdemain in the senatorial order, perceived the finesse, and yesterday I was present at a grand division of the 
city, and there I beheld my fellow citizens very accurately 
counting all tru'ir chickens, not only before any of them were 
hatched, but before above one half of the eggs were laid. In 
short, they fairly contended about the future forms of our government, whether it should be founded upon Aristocratic or 
Democratic principles. 
</p><p>
I stood in the balcony, and on my right hand were ranged 
all the people of property, with some few poor dependants, 
and on the other all the tradesmen, &c. who thought it worth 
their while to leave daily labor for the good of the country. The 
spirit of the English Constitution has yet a little influence left, 
and but a little. The remains of it, however, will give the 
wealthy people a superiority this time, but would they secure 
it, they must banish all schoolmaster and confine all knowledge to themselves. This cannot be. The mob begin to 
think and to reason. Poor reptiles ! it is with them a vernal 
morning, they are struggling to cast off their winter's slough, 
they bask in the sunshine, and ere noon they will bite, depend 
upon it. The gentry begin to fear this. Their committee will 
be appointed, they will deceive the people, and again forfeit a 
share of their confidence. And if these instances of what 
with one side is policy, with the other perfidy, shall continue 
to increase, and become more frequent, farewell aristocracy. 
I see, and I see it with fear and trembling, that if the disputes 
with Britain continue, we shall be under the worst of all possible dominions. We shall be under the domination of a riotous mob. 
</p><p>
It is the interest of all men, therefore, to seek for reunion with the parent state. A safe compact seems in my poor 
opinion to be now tendered. Internal taxation to be left with 
ourselves. The right of regulating trade to be vested in Britain, where alone is found the power of protecting it. I trust 
you will agree with me, that this is the only possible mode of union. Men by nature are free as the air. When they enter 
into society, there is, there must be, an implied compact, for there never yet was an express one, that a part of this freedom 
shall be given up for the security of the remainder. But. what part? The answer is plain. The least possible, considering 
the circumstances of the society, which constitute what may be called its political necessity. And what does this political 
necessity require in the present instance ? Not that Britain 
should lay imposts upon us for the support of government, nor 
for its defence. Not that she should regulate our internal police. These things affect us only. She can have no right to 
interfere. To these things we ourselves are competent. But can it be said, that we are competent to the regulating of 
trade ? The position is absurd, for this affects every part of the British Empire, every part of the habitable earth. If 
Great Britain, if Ireland, if America, if all of them, are to make laws of trade, there must be a collision of these different 
authorities, and then who is to decide the v is major ? To recur to this, if possible to be avoided, is the greatest of all great absurdities. 
</p><p>
Political necessity therefore requires, that this power should be placed in the hands of one part of the empire. Is 
it a question which part ? Let me answer by asking another. Pray which part of the empire protects trade ? Which part 
of the empire receives almost immense sums to guard the rest ? And what danger is in the trust ? Some men object, 
that England will draw all the profits of our trade into her 
coffers. All that she can, undoubtedly. But unless a reasonable compensation for his trouble be left to the merchant 
here, she destroys the trade, and then she will receive no profit from it. 
</p><p>
If I remember, in one of those kind letters with which you 
have honored me, you desire my thoughts on matters as they 
rise. How much pleasure I take in complying with your requests let my present letter convince you. If I am faulty in 
telling things, which you know better than I do, you must excuse this fault, and a thousand others for which I can make no 
apology. I am, Sir, &c.

Dear Madam, 
</p><p>
It is with inexpressible concern, that I am this day informed of the death of my sister. We all sustain in her a great 
loss, but you in particular, who are thus bereft of the companion of your age, must feel it most severely. Would to God it 
were in my power to alleviate the pangs of a sorrowing parent. 
But this is not my lot. My friend Wilkins will, I am sure, on 
this occasion do the duties of a child and a friend. There is 
one comforter, who weighs our minutes, and numbers out our 
days. It is He, who has inflicted upon us the weight of public and private calamities, and He best knows when to remove the burthen. I am sorry it is not in my power to see 
you at present. I know it is your wish, that I were removed 
from public affairs ; indeed, as far as relates to my own ease 
and enjoyments, I wish so too. But I know it is the duty of 
every good citizen or man to preserve that post, in which by a 
superior order he is placed. Where the happiness of a considerable part of our fellow creatures is deeply concerned, we 
soon feel the insignificancy of an individual. And whatever lot 
that individual shall experience, while a conscious rectitude of 
conduct inspires and supports him, though he may be unfortunate, he cannot be miserable. 
</p><p>
What may be the event of the present war, it is not in man 
to determine. Great revolutions of empire are seldom achieved without much human calamity ; but the worst, which can 
happen, is to fall on the last bleak mountain of America, and he who dies there, in defence of the injured rights of mankind, 
is happier than his conqueror, more beloved by mankind, more applauded by his own heart. 
</p><p>
The death of my sister has incapacitated me for mirth ; my 
letter, therefore, is of an improper complexion to one already 
afflicted. My love to my sisters, to Wilkins, whose integrity 
I love and respect, to the good natured Counsellor of Bermuda, and such others as deserve it. The number is not great. 
</p><p>
Pray believe me most sincerely your affectionate son.

[To the President of the Council of Safety]
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I arrived here yesterday noon, and last evening had some 
little conversation with the General and others upon the state 
of our affairs. They are far from being such as could be wished. 
General Nixon's brigade, which ought to have consisted of at 
least fifteen hundred men. has four regiments, the whole of 
which do not contain six hundred. In short, not to enter into 
a tedious detail, two thousand six hundred continental troops, 
and two thousand militia, of which about one thousand are 
from this State, make the whole force in this quarter. To 
the westward there are about five hundred. If the enemy 
would follow, I know not when we should stop, as matters now 
stand. We have only two old iron field pieces. We can get 
no more, <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker'>General Washington</a> having ordered them all to the 
southern department. Fort Anne is abandoned, and Fort 
George will be so by tomorrow, if it be not sooner taken. 
Everything is moved away from this place, as fast as it can be down to Moses Creek, a post five miles from hence, where 
the General proposes to assemble his army. If the enemy 
give us some time, I imagine the roads will be so obstructed, 
that, with the help of a few brave fellows in the woods, we 
should be able so to annoy <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>, as to prevent him 
from penetrating far into the country. A body of troops are 
to be formed to the eastward of this, in order to cover the 
Grants (Vermont) and harrass the rear of the enemy, if they 
come down Hudson's river. By the bye, I imagine the inhabitants of that country will join <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Burgoyne</a>, who has issued a 
proclamation calling them in to confer with Colonel Skene. 
He has issued another well written proclamation, which has 
been freely circulated. It is dated at camp, near Ticonderoga, 
from which circumstance, as well as from the matter of it, I 
am led to believe he expects much aid from the tories. Upon 
the whole, I think we shall do very well, but this opinion is 
founded merely upon the barriers, which nature has raised 
against all access from the northward. I just now mentioned 
to the General the calling out of the militia of Tryon county. 
He says we may call, but we shall not get them. This is by 
no means a comfortable idea. I have the honor to be,

[To the President of the Council of Safety]
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I left Fort Edward with <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='met colleague'>General Schuyler</a> at noon, and 
shall return thither some time tomorrow morning. Fort 
George was destroyed yesterday afternoon, previous to which 
the provisions, stores, and batteaux, were removed, and this 
morning about ten o'clock the last of them passed us about 
three miles to the northward of Fort Edward, at which place 
all the troops from the Lake are arrived, and they, together 
with some others, form an advanced post towards Fort George. 
About twelve hundred, perhaps more, are somewhat farther 
advanced upon the road to Fort Anne. 
</p><p>
The enemy have not yet made any motion that we know of, nor indeed can they make any of consequence, until they 
shall have procured carriages, and then they may find it rather 
difficult to come this way, if proper care be taken to prevent 
them from procuring forage. For this purpose I shall give it 
as my opinion to the General, whenever he asks it, to break 
up all the settlements. upon our northern frontier, to drive off 
the cattle, secure or destroy the forage, and also to destroy the 
sawmills. These measures, harsh as they may seem, are I 
am confident absolutely necessary. They ought undoubtedly to be taken with prudence, and temperately carried into 
execution : but I will venture to say, that if we lay it down as 
a maxim, never to contend for ground but in the last necessity, 
and to leave nothing but a wilderness to the enemy, their progress must be impeded by obstacles, which it is not in human 
nature to surmount ; and then, unless we have, with our usual 
good nature, built posts for their defence, they must at the approach of winter retire to the place, from whence they first set 
out. The militia from the eastward come in by degrees, and 
I expect we shall soon be in force to carry on the petite guerre 
to advantage, provided always <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Burgoyne</a> attempts to annoy us, 
for it is pretty clear that we cannot get at him. I am, &,c.

Sir, 
</p><p>
We have received yours of the 19th, which has afforded 
us great pleasure, since we are enabled in some measure to 
collect from it our errand to the northward, " one of the most 
important objects of our journey " being, in the opinion of your 
honorable board, to write the news. Could we have conceived, that this was your intention in appointing us a committee 
" to confer with Major <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='met colleague'>General Schuyler</a> upon such measures, 
as might from time to time appear necessary to be pursued by 
this State, for the aid and support of the northern department," 
we should have endeavored so to correspond with the Council, 
as to have informed them, as far as lay in our power, of the 
'manner of the retreat from Ticonderoga, the number of the 
men that came off, whether any or how many were taken, whether 
the sick came away, whether the troops brought off their arms" 
and the like. It is not in our power, Sir, to answer these important objects of our journey, because we are much in the 
dark about those matters, which attract the attention and strict 
scrutiny of your honorable board, and about which the General can give us no information ; but we shall leave this place 
tomorrow morning, to wait upon you, and answer such questions as you shall be pleased to put to us. 
</p><p>
It was determined upon to leave the ground occupied by 
our advanced posts, upon the road to Fort Anne and Fort 
George, and retire to Fort Edward in the way to this place, 
having previously removed everything. About noon the picquet guard of the party, upon the Fort Anne road, was attacked by savages and British troops. It is not, we suppose, of 
great importance minutely to describe this engagement. We 
will therefore record nothing more upon your minutes, than 
that we drove off the enemy, and in so doing had one man killed and scalped, twelve more killed, and twelve wounded, 
five of them mortally. This evening the retreat was completed to this place, where the General would be strongly 
posted, if he had men. Three hundred of the militia of Massachusetts Bay went off this morning, in spite of the opposition, 
we should have said entreaties, of their officers. All the militia on the ground are so heartily tired, and so extremely desirous of getting home, that it is more than probable none of 
them will remain ten days longer. One half was discharged 
two days ago, to silence, if possible, their clamor ; and the remainder, officers excepted, will soon discharge themselves, at 
which time the army in the northern department will consist 
of about twenty-seven hundred continental troops, sick and 
well. We make no comments. 
</p><p>
But, Sir, <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Burgoyne</a> cannot flee. If a body of three thousand men can be formed from the militia of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, somewhere upon the New 
Hampshire Grants ; if <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker'>General Washington</a> can spare a reinforcement of fifteen hundred good troops to this army ; if, 
discharging all the militia in the Forts and passes of the Highlands, the governor is put at the head of one third of the militia of the state, and two hundred good riflemen, and sent into 
Tryon county ; we may laugh at Mr Howe and <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Mr Burgoyne</a>. We are too ignorant of the situation of affairs to the 
southward, to say whether these things are practicable, and, 
therefore, give our sentiments on matters as they appear. We 
</p><p>
have the honor to be, Sic.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Upon my return from Albany, it was at my request determined, that, instead of going to Springfield, I should repair to 
Head-Quarters. In consequence, with <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague friend met'>Mr Jay</a>, I went thither. 
Unfortunately we did not arrive at Philadelphia, until the day 
it had been determined to send <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>Gates</a> to take the command of 
the northern department. You will readily believe, that we 
were not pleased at this resolution, and I assure you for my 
own part, I felt exceedingly distressed at your removal, just 
when changing fortune began to declare in our favor. Congress, I hope, will perceive, that our successes have been owing 
to the judicious plans adopted previous to your removal. 
</p><p>
Our representations of your situation have obtained, as by 
this time you must be sensible, such reinforcement for the 
northern armies, as will enable <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>Gates</a> to act with eclat, if he 
has spirit and understanding sufficient for that purpose. His 
situation is certainly an eligible one. As his friend, I am pleased 
at the opportunity he has of acquiring honor, while I sincerely 
lament his possessing this opportunity at your expense. However, it was become necessary, for the eastern folks declared, 
that their people would not march while you had the command. In misfortunes, great minds rise superior to adversity, 
end this too, whether they are of a public or private nature. 
</p><p>
With that incautiousness natural to me, and of which I scorn 
to divest myself among my friends, let me say, that I think you 
will find it for your honor to resign, but in this, festina lente, 
the hour is not yet come. I wish you would direct the plan 
you think best for the northern armies, pointing out the posts 
necessary to he taken, the manosuvres to be made, and the like, 
which your intimate knowledge of the country enables you to 
do better than most men. It seems to me we should contrive 
to possess the height to the northward of Fort Edward, if it be 
practicable to maintain it, and then, by keeping parties around 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Burgoyne's army</a>, intercept his supplies, and force him to quit 
his post at Batten Kill. This is a reverie, but clearly something 
capital may be done ; perhaps he may be attacked with success 
in his lines. I am inclined to believe, that the unexpected sight 
of our troops, advancing with fixed bayonets without firing a shot, 
would so intimidate his soldiers, that they would not stand. 
But to the purpose. I could wish that having digested your 
plan, you would send it to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>Gates</a>, as the continuation of what 
you intended, if successful loathe eastward and westward, which, 
thank God, you have been. Introduce it to him under the idea, 
that you think it your duty to contribute to the success of the 
American arms, as well out of as in power, and send a copy of 
the whole to Congress, in which you may also, with great propriety, mention as a reason why you have not obeyed their order, that <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> was so long ou his journey, that the attention, which you were obliged to pay to the northern arrny, 
would not permit you to provide for yours. This, and Indian 
affairs, are good causes for your stay. I am, yours,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The receipt of your favor of the seventh, last night, gave 
me great pleasure. I am happy for the sake of America, that 
your sentiments so perfectly coincided with my own. The 
commander in chief of the northern department may, if he 
pleases, neglect to ask, or disdain to receive advice, but those 
who know him will, I am sure, be convinced that he wants it. 
Fortune may make him a great man, in the estimation of the 
vulgar, who will fix their estimation at their own price, let the 
intrinsic value be what it will, but it is not in the power of fortune to bestow those talents, which are necessary to render a 
person superior to her malice. This being the case, it is but 
equal, that, between competitors, she should take the weaker 
side to preserve the natural equality of mankind. 
</p><p>
I am confident that the proper advantages will not be taken of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Burgoyne's</a> situation. We have no chance, I fear, in that 
quarter from management. The only resource, therefore, will be a hattle, and I doubt our skill to manage that. At any 
rate, the season closes fast, and if <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Burgoyne</a> cannot get to Albany, he must at least retire to Ticonderoga. I learn that 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>Gates's</a> army is eleven, and <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>Lincoln's</a> five thousand. Tant mieux sed quare de hoc. I am also told that the Indians are 
determined to take up the hatchet for us. If this be true, it would be infinitely better to wear away the enemy's army, by 
a scrupulous and polite attention, than to violate the rules of decorum and the laws of hospitality, by making an attack upon strangers in our own country. 
</p><p>
From Peekskill we have intelligence, that the enemy 
have marched into New Jersey with five thousand men, and 
from their motions seem determined to attempt the western 
pass of the mountains. Either their numbers are exaggerated 
greatly, or they mean some capital diversion. I rather think 
the former, and that their object is merely to return the compliment, which Sullivan paid them on Staten Island. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker'>General Washington</a>, as you will have heard before this 
reaches you, has had a severe conflict with Howe. He was 
obliged to retire. Our loss is far from inconsiderable. Howe, 
I imagine, will get Philadelphia. This will be determined at 
Swede's Ford on the Schuykill. If we can beat him, he 
will be, if not mined, yet as near it as any man need be. If 
the contrary happens, we must, to say the best of it, have another winter's campaign. 
</p><p>
The Chief Justice (<a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague friend met'>Jay</a>) is gone to fetch his wife. The 
Chancellor (Livingston) is solacing himself with his wife, his 
farm, and his imagination. Our Senate is doing, I know not 
what. In Assembly we wrangle long to little purpose. You 
will think so, when I tell you, that from nine in the morning 
till dusk in the evening, we were employed in appointing Scott, 
Pawling, Yates, and Webster to be the council of appointment. 
I tremble for the consequences, but I smile, and shall continue 
to do sc , if possible. We have not appointed delegates, nor 
do I know when or whom we shall appoint. We have some 
principles of fermentation, which must, if it be possible, evaporate before that business is entered upon. We are just about 
to think of a Militia Law, and I should be happy to be informed of your sentiments, or rather plans, upon that subject. It 
is doubtless of importance, and the mode now to be adopted, 
whether good or evil, will have a very distant operation. It 
will become a principal part of the jurisprudence of the State, 
and, as such, shed an influence upon the Constitution. I am 
yours, &c.

Dear Madam, 
</p><p>
I sit down to let you know, that I am in this world, though in a remote part of it. I have heard of you but not 
form you, since I left <a href='/results.php?city=morrisania' rel='city'>Morrisania</a> ; neither have I had the satisfaction to learn, that, of the many letters I have written, 
you have ever received one. It would give me infinite pleasure to hear of my friends, yourself in particular, but 
since it is my lot to know no more than the burthen of general 
report, I must be contented. 
</p><p>
I received great pain from being informed, that you are 
distressed on my account. Be of good cheer, I pray you. I 
have all that happiness, which flows from conscious rectitude. 
I am blessed with as great a portion of health, as usually belongs 
to the share of mankind. Content with what I have, and with 
what I am, I look forward serenely to the course of events, confident that the Fountain of supreme wisdom and virtue will provide for the happiness of his creatures. It gives me pain, that 
I am separated from those I love, but comparing this with 
what thousands suffer, I dare not repine. Let me earnestly 
recommend to you so much of religion, as to bear inevitable 
evils with resignation. I would that it were in my power to 
solace and comfort your declining age. The duty I owe to 
a tender parent demands this of me, but a higher duty has 
bound me to the service of my fellow creatures. The natural indolence of my disposition has unfitted me for the paths of 
ambition, and the early possession of power taught me how 
little it deserves to be prized. Whenever the present storm 
subsides, I shall rush with eagerness into the bosom of private 
life, but while it continues, and while my country calls for the 
exertion of that little share of abilities, which it has pleased 
God to bestow on me, I hold it my indispensable duty to give 
myself to her. 
</p><p>
I know that for such sentiments I am called a rebel, and that such sentiments are not fashionable among the folks you 
see. It is possible, though I hope not, that your maternal tenderness may lead you to wish, that I would resign these 
sentiments. Let me, however, entreat, that you be not concerned on my account. I shall again see you, perhaps the 
time is not far off. I am much distressed for . I sincerely love him, and I fear that we are separated for a long season. 
Pray remember me to him most affectionately, and to my sister. 
She too has been much wounded. The loss of her infant 
must have greatly distressed her ; but perhaps her own expedience may have led her to prize life at its just value, and if 
so, it is a blessing she may not think so estimable, as to wish it 
for her child. Remember me most tenderly to all her little 
infants, to Isaac particularly, who, I am told, has not forgotten me. Poor child, I hope it may be in my power to return his 
attention by the protection of a parent. God forbid that he 
should need it, or any of them. Remember me to Mrs Ashfield and her children, for I think she has more than one. 
I wish her husband had acted more consistently ; but enough 
of this. And now, my dear Madam, let me again entreat 
you to make yourself happy. Discard the gloomy ideas, 
which are too apt to crowd into the mind in your situation 
and time of life. There is enough of sorrow in this world, 
without looking into futurity for it. Hope the best. If it happens, well; if not, it will then be time enough to be afflicted, 
and at any rate the intermediate space will be well filled. 
Adieu. Yours, most affectionately.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I expected before this time to have written to you, that 
provision is made for the American officers, but that thief of 
time, procrastination, has kept it off from time to time. The 
question is now the order of the day, and, as such, takes 
place of every other business. When it will be determined, 
I know not, but this I know, that it shall be finished one way 
or the other before anything else, let what will happen. I 
am confident it will go right, if something very extraordinary 
does not occur. In the interim nothing is done. I feel as 
severely on this occasion as you can do. All will yet go well. 
</p><p>
We have determined to send <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>Gates</a> to Hudson River, 
where he is to command very largely. But he is to receive 
instructions, which shall be proper. You are directed to call 
a council of major generals, in which the chief engineer is officially to be a member, and to which, by a subsequent resolution, Generals <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>Gates</a> and Mifflin were ordered to repair. 
As these gentlemen ought not to receive orders immediately 
from Congress, they are, as you will see, permitted to leave 
the board of war upon your order. This amendment was 
therefore acquiesced in unanimously. Colonel Harrison will, I believe, be again appointed a member of the Board of War. 
This I mention by the bye. I add my wish, that your business and your inclinations may be so ordered, as to allow him 
to accept of it. For this I have many reasons. Every man 
of business knows, that words are of great weight, and we receive reports from the Board of War every day. I need say 
no more, except that it is not always possible to weigh sentences with that accuracy in a public assembly, which is practicable in the closet.* It is astonishing that Congress, who 
certainly are not without sufficient apprehension, should at 
so critical a moment as the present be so supine, but this is 
human nature, and we must bear it. I have a remedy in contemplation. If you were an unconcerned spectator, it would 
divert you to see, that although a majority of our House have 
been agreed in a certain point, ever since Mr Dana arrived 
here, yet nothing is done. 
</p><p>
Apropos, of your council of war. Should you determine 
on anything, which, considering the course of human affairs, 
is, I confess, rather improbable, let Congress know nothing 
about it. A secret should never be trusted to many bosoms. 
I will forfeit anything, except reputation, that it will not be 
well kept, even by those necessarily confided in. I am, &LC.

Dear General, 
</p><p>
We are going on with the regimental arrangements as fast 
as possible, and I think the day begins to appear with respect to 
that business. Had our Saviour addressed a chapter to the rulers of mankind, as he did many to the subjects, I am persuaded his good sense would have dictated this text ; Be not wse 
overmuch. Had the several members, who compose our 
multifarious body, been only wise enough, our business would 
long since have been completed. But our superior abilities, 
or the desire of appearing to possess them, lead us to such 
exquisite tediousness of debate, that the most precious moments pass unheeded away like vulgar things. 
</p><p>
As to what you mention of the extraordinary demeanor 
of some gentlemen, I cannot but agree with you, that such 
conduct is not the most honorable. But, on the other hand, 
you must allow that it is the most safe, and certainly you are 
not to learn, that, however ignorant of that happy art in your 
own person, the bulk of us bipeds know well how to balance 
solid pudding against empty praise. There are other things, 
my dear Sir, besides virtue, which are their own reward. 
And the feelings of others will, unless I mistake, sooner or 
later break out into a retribution of those acts and neglects, 
which at present pass away unnoticed by the herd of observers, or rather lookers on. 
</p><p>
As to your friend, who has thought proper to demand of 
you a command, I did believe from the first, that his resignation was, like some former ones from the same quarter, 
merely calculated to gain either promotion, or favor, or revenge. I was therefore led to expect, that his merits and 
our misfortune in losing him would become the topic of 
declamation, and took the earliest opportunity to express in the 
very strongest terms my satisfaction, my joy, at the receipt of 
the letter from him, and of consequence to assign the reasons why this event gave me so much pleasure. This gave a very 
different turn to affairs. Panegyric dwindled to apology, 
and no opposition was made to the main point of accepting 
his resignation. The next day I was informed, that he did not 
intend to resign, that his letter was quite misunderstood. &tc. 
The gentleman, however, had been so unlucky, as to use the 
most pointed terms, and therefore his aid, from whom the 
information came, was told that the observations he made came 
too late. I am persuaded, that he will attempt to get reinstated, 
if the least probability of success appears, but L am equally persuaded, that his attempts will fail. I believe his friends 
are hitherto of the same opinion, and therefore we have 
as yet had no attempts made in Congress, and possibly we 
never shall. I am, &c,

</p><p>
Dear General 
</p><p>
I have a word to say to you on the subject of promotion, 
which we have just now finished, or rather unfinished, at least 
if that matter was before in an unfinished situation. That famous incomprehensible Baltimore resolution, introduced, unluckily perhaps, a very tedious debate, which terminated at 
length by rejecting the whole of what the committee reported, 
with relation to the promoting of officers. You may be a 
little surprised, when I tell you, that upon the whole matter I 
believe this is best. But how ? It is true, I confess, that 
much ground of heart-burning is left, under the Baltimore 
resolution governing these matters by the mysterious trinity of 
seniority, merit, and quota. 
</p><p>
Let me, however, on the other hand observe, that to tie up 
the hands of the republic as to the officers, whom they are to 
appoint, is utterly inconsistent with the republican principles of 
government, which ought to prevail among us. No danger, 
it .is true, can arise at present ; but, my dear Sir, we are laying 
foundations, and how posterity in future wars may build on 
the foundations laid by ancestors, whom they will certainly 
reverence, no man can be hardy enough to assert. What 
then, you will say, is the effect of the new rule? Tn my 
poor opinion it is no rule. What then is the use of the 
resolution ? Nothing more, than an apology for officers, whom 
it may be found necessary to supersede. 
</p><p>
Congress, in effect, seem to have pledged themselves to 
their constitutents, that they will pay a due attention in the 
quota of troops furnished by the States respectively to the seniority of the several officers, and to that degree of military abilities, which nature or industry may have conferred upon deserving individuals. You ask me what is to be the rule of promotion below the degree of a general officer. I answer, that Congress could not with propriety make any rule. They 
have given to the States the power of appointing the officers 
in their own regiments; consequently it would be idle to restrict them, as to the persons whom they shall appoint. It will, 
therefore, be necessary to make application to the several 
States on the occasion. They have already, I believe, in 
most instances given you the necessary power, and if so, then 
to fix the order of promotion will only be a limitation of such 
power. I am, dear General, most sincerely yours,

Dear General,

I was in your debt. It is my fate always to be so with 
my friends. But, believe me, my heart owes nothing. Let 
me add, that you can do me no favor so great, as to comply 
with your wishes, except an opportunity to serve the public, 
which indeed is your highest wish, as you have evinced fully 
to all the world, and particularly to your friends. 
</p><p>
I feel the full force of your reasoning. The faith of Congress is in some measure plighted to M. de la Neuville, but 
it is not their interest that his brevet shall give command. I 
will take care to get this expressed by a particular resolution. 
The Baron has a claim, from his merit, to be noticed, but I 
never will consent to grant what I am told he requests, and 
I think Congress will not. At least they will not if I can 
help it.

I this instant was informed of the opportunity of an express for camp, which goes immediately. Let me, however, 
congratulate you on the affair at Monmouth, on the whole affair. It might have been better, it is said. I think not, for 
you have, even from your enemies, the honor of that day. 
You have enemies. It is happy for you that you have. A 
man of sentiment has not so much honor, as the vulgar suppose, in resigning life and fortune for the service of his country. He does not value them as highly as the vulgar do. 
Would he give the highest evidence, let him sacrifice his feelings. In the history of last winter, posterity will do you justice. Adieu, believe me sincerely yours,

</p><p>
Dear General, 
</p><p>
The conduct, which the enemy may pursue, with relation 
to us, is not quite decided. But I have not a doubt, that their efforts during the next campaign will be chiefly towards our 
frontiers, with a view to weary us into submission. At the same time they will perhaps endeavor to keep such posts in 
our country, as to render the communications tedious, difficult, and expensive. My ideas as to our power of carrying on the 
war differ in some respects from those, whose opinions I respect. The .resources of the country may be drawn forth by 
our paper, at the same time it must be confessed, that this paper will thereby be less valuable. After all, the debt does not 
increase, for a certain sterling sum, which would have paid it 
one year ago, will pay it now. The depreciation in the interim has operated as a tax. 
</p><p>
I very sincerely lament, that this tax has fallen heavy on 
those, who have served and continue to serve their country. 
It is a peculiar hardship upon us, that fully to relieve the evils 
they labor under is not in our power. This leads me to the 
petition you mention, or representation, which I have not yet 
seen, and never wish to see. I cannot easily express to you how much I was hurt at being informed of it. Not indeed as 
to the matter, for that I really am a stranger to, but as to the manner in which it was procured. For, in the first place, it 
gave my enemies, (who were such in some degree for my earnest support of the claims of the army heretofore,) no small 
cause of triumph. This, say they, is the consequence of your zeal for an establishment. Besides this, I considered myself 
in some measure as an advocate for the army. I loved them, 
from my acquaintance with some individuals, and for the sufferings which as a body they had bravely and patiently endured ; and, therefore, I could not but suffer when I found them taking steps, which in my opinion cannot do them honor, and 
which incapacitated me from urging, as I otherwise should have done, every redress in our power of their grievances. 
</p><p>
But what chiefly affected v me was, that this meeting of delegates from brigades, in a mixture of civil and military capacity, carries with it the air of deeper design, than I believe to 
be in the bosoms of those, who were immediately concerned. 
It was by procedures such as these, that the good Fairfax made way for a crafty Cromwell, and that he dismissed a 
tedious wrangling Parliament, and established a military despotism. It is a melancholy truth, that when one faction takes 
possession of the human heart, men are hurried into extremes, 
which make considerate people tremble. I will not do your 
army the injustice even to permit a thought, that they wish to 
get rid of their General. But, Sir, their, and your, and our 
enemies, do not want the confidence to say so, and indeed to 
say that they can prove it, and to attempt that proof from the 
manner of procuring (agitating as they term it) the petition 
in question. Certainly could such ideas be inculcated, it 
would answer their views. It would also answer their views 
to instil into the army a distrust of Congress, and therefore I 
doubt not but the enemies of both are assiduous in this business. I find also the British commissioners are so bare faced, 
as to hold out the bait of promotion in the royal army to such, 
as will fall in with their designs, and doubtless a peculiar portion of their bounty will be dispensed to those, who shall sow 
the seeds of dissensions in an army, which, as they cannot 
conquer it, it is their only resource to divide. 
</p><p>
Thinking on this subject as I do, it did and does appear to me my duty, as a good citizen, thoroughly to discountenance every measure of this kind, particularly when it is 
ushered forth, as the first mention of this affair was to me, by 
an observation that the army had it in their power to do themselves justice. It makes me unhappy to learn, that such 
discourse prevails I am certain that they who use it have no design ; but they should consider that it affords matter for 
the designs of others to work upon. It has not made any serious impression, I believe, on the minds of those, whose opinions have real weight, because it is considered as one of those 
light expressions, which flow from the luxuriance of the imagination. Little do those, who say such things, know the difficulties of subsisting an army. 
</p><p>
The Marquis will hand you a plan, on which I shall say 
nothing, because I have already had a great deal of trouble 
with it, and he could say more than I can write in a week, 
and you know more of the subject than all of us together. 
</p><p>
We have no news. Let me then tell you what has the 
merit of truth, if not the charms of novelty, that I am, dear 
General, very sincerely yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gom" rel="me">Gouverneur Morris</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. <a href='/results.php?tla=chl' rel=''>General Lee's</a> affair hangs by the eyelids. We 
spent one day upon it without even touching upon its merits. 
The debate Was, in what manner to proceed to a decision. 
Some contended for the propriety of resolving simply to approve or disapprove of the sentence. Others were for entering into the considerations of the charges, and the evidence 
on them separately, without however making any entry on the 
minutes. A third for doing this, and making the entries. 
This, as the most systematic method, I supported, for truly I 
know not how to determine in the lump. Granting him 
guilty of all the charges, it is too light a punishment. And 
if he is not guilty, in the opinion of Congress, of any one, 
there would be an injustice in not declaring their opinion. 
</p><p>
Conway has again applied for a certificate of his good services, and I have again opposed the grant of it. This letter 
lies on the table. Again, my friend, adieu.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>Lincoln</a> is our Minister of War, and the election to that office has been to you most honorable, for all agreed that you 
were the proper person, and nothing prevented your unanimous appointment, but an opinion almost as unanimous, that, if 
recalled from your command, you could not be replaced. 
</p><p>
That you were not chosen I do truly lament, for I can with 
great truth assure you, that I know not a man who is in my 
opinion equal to the office except yourself. It is, however, 
much consolation to me, that <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a> is an honest 
and a sensible man, and, what is also of importance, that he is an 
industrious man. These are qualities, which will make him 
a good Minister, if not a great one, and these qualities will 
go far towards restoring or rather creating that order and regularity, without which a Minister of the most superior genius 
and talents would be only a lion in the toils, and be the sooner exhausted in proportion to his superior strength and more 
vigorous struggles. 
</p><p>
I shall not now attempt to remove your obstacles to the 
acceptance, though it is right that they should not weigh with 
you too heavily, because it is not impossible that your country 
may still call you from the field to serve in the cabinet. I 
cannot, however, omit the present opportunity of lodging in 
the bosom of friendly confidence my sentiments of our interior 
political situation. That Congress have not proper powers I see, 
I feel, and I lament. Their Ministers have the arduous task 
before them to govern without power, nay, more, to obtain the 
power necessary to govern. They must persuade where others command, and the strong phalanx of private interest, with 
the impetuous sallies of private politics and party, encounters 
them at every step. 
</p><p>
These features of our character and situation are very disagreeable, but are not these the distinguishing marks of government in its infancy, in every age and in every clime ? To 
reinforce the reasonings, to impress the arguments, and to 
sweeten the persuasions of the public servants, we have that 
great friend to sovereign authority, a foreign war. Conviction 
goes but very slowly to the popular mind, but it goes. The 
advantages of union and decision in carrying on a war, the 
disadvantages, which flow from the want of them, the waste, 
the expense, and inefficacy of disjointed efforts over the face 
of an immense region, the incompetency of determining what 
is best for the whole through thirteen different communities, whose rulers are yet ignorant of what is best even for the single one which they govern ; these, with the thousand others, 
which it is hardly in language to enumerate or in genius to 
conceive, or in anything but experience to show, these must 
at last induce the people of America, if the war continues, to 
entrust proper powers to the American sovereign, as they have 
already compelled that sovereign reluctantly to relinquish the 
administration, and entrust to their Ministers the care of 
this immense republic. I say, if the war continues, or if it 
does not continue, I have no hope, no expectation, that the 
government will acquire force ; and I will go further, I have 
no hope, that our union can subsist, except in the form of an 
absolute monarchy, and this does not seem to consist with 
the taste and temper of the people. The necessary consequence, if I am right, is, that a separation must take place, 
and consequently wars, for near neighbors are very rarely, if 
ever, good neighbors. But all political reasonings are liable to 
very great uncertainty, and it is only the Supreme Intelligence, 
who can determine sufficiently, even on facts to ground reasonings. Still, our conduct must be swayed by our opinions, and 
therefore from the same attachment to the happiness of mankind, which prompted my first efforts in this revolution, I am 
now induced to wish, that Congress may be possessed of more, 
much more authority, than has hitherto been delegated to 
them. 
</p><p>
Though you are not Minister of War, you must act in some 
measure us such, and you will see that you are also to be a 
kind of financier. Indeed the distance of the Southern States, 
the interruptions in communications with them, the changes 
which take place before facts can be known here, and determinations on them transmitted from hence, all require that a man 
of sense and integrity should act on liberal principles, as circumstances may require. From considerations like these, I have 
been induced to think, that there was wisdom in leaving you where you are, and I might have agreed in opinion on that 
subject with other people, only I am inclined to think, that the Southern States will be evacuated. 
</p><p>
You have, I am convinced, very much the confidence of those Slates, and I rely that you will press them hard on the 
score of revenue. YV.i remember the story of Archimedes, who said to the king of Syracuse, give me a place to stand on 
and I will move the earth. It may with great truth he said to 
the several States, give money to support us and we will establish your independence. With great regard and sincerity, 
I am yours,

Dear <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague friend met'>Jay</a>, 
</p><p>
I have received your letter of the 13th of October, from 
Paris. That part of it in cypher, (relating to Oswald's commission,) I have communicated only to <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague friend met'>Mr Morris</a> and Mr Livingston ; to them, and to them only, for reasons which 
will be obvious to you. Your letters to Congress, for 
such I call those you write the Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
are what they ought to be, and have the effect you would 
wish. You should remember, however, that the back lands 
are as important in the eyes of some, as the fisheries are in 
those of others. Men are forgetful, and therefore it will be 
well by timely declarations of your sentiments to recall your 
conduct while in Congress. You and I differ about the western country, but you and your sovereign are of the same option. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='colleague met'>General McDougall</a>, Colonel Brooks of the Massachusetts, 
and Colonel Ogden of the Jersey line, are now here, with a 
petition to Congress from the army for pay. The army are 
now disciplined, and their wants as to food and clothing are 
relieved, but they are not paid. Their back accounts are 
not settled. If settled, the balances are not secured by competent funds. No provision is made for the half-pay promised 
them. Some persons, and indeed some Slates, pretend to dispute their claim to it. The army have swords in their hands. 
You know enough of the history of mankind to know much 
more than I have said, and possibly much more than they 
themselves yet think of. I will add, however, that I am glad 
to sec things in their present train. Depend on it, good will 
arise from the situation to which we are hastening. And this 
you may rely on, that my efforts will not he wanting. I pledge 
myself to you on the present occasion, an I although I think it 
probable, that much of convulsion will ensue, yet it must terminate in giving to government that power, without which 
government is but a name. 
</p><p>
Accept my sincere wishes, that the year now commencing 
may prove to you and yours the kind dispenser of every 
human felicity. All your friends are well, and rejoice that you 
are in a situation so essential to America, as that which you 
now hold. Some persons have hinted to me, that you are too 
suspicious. I think they are much mistaken. The observation, if it proceeds from the heart, shows only that they are 
not so well acquainted will) human nature as you are. Go on, 
my good friend, continue to merit the esteem of all good men, 
and give to envy her favorite food. When you are tired of 
Europe, and have completed your business there, I will invits 
you, in the language of Sheastone,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I cannot omit so good an opportunity of communicating to you my thoughts on the present situation of affairs. Knowing 
as I do, that your heart is actuated by the same principles of justice, and the same sentiments of policy, which, influence my 
own, I can venture on a freedom of communication which, to 
most men, would be imprudent. The approach of peace cannot but give very serious thoughts to every officer and soldier 
of the American army. The promises made by the public will, if performed, be of beneficial importance, and, if broken, 
extremely injurious. The main army have had anxieties on this subject ; and though I do not pretend to guess precisely 
their sentiments, I am convinced they will not easily forego their expectations. Their murmurs, though not loud, are 
deep ; and I do not think that the committee they have sent hither will, from their report, allay the apprehensions which were excited. 
</p><p>
From this committee, however, I learn that they were precipitating themselves in the road to ruin. I mean by pursuing 
a recommendation to the several States for compensation. 
This, which would have divided them into thirteen different 
parts, would have made it easy to elude the force of their applications, or, after their compliance, to have resumed any 
grants made in consequence of them, when the army should 
have been disbanded. At present, however, the committee have 
become so thoroughly persuaded, that the army will be defrauded, unless they unitedly pursue a common object, that I 
believe it will soon become the general sentiment. If the army, in common with all other public creditors, insist on the 
grant of general permanent fluids for liquidating all the public 
debts, there can be little doubt that such revenues will be obtained ; and there can be no doubt, that, when they are obtained, they will afford to every order of public creditors a solid 
security. The half-pay promised the officers is estimated to 
be worth five and a half years' full pay in hand. 
</p><p>
Admitting, then, that the proper revenues were obtained, 
the officer would be able always to sell his stock for the value. 
It is needless to say, that the United States have no other mode 
of paying the arrearages due to the army. It is also unnecessary to mention, that this kind of provision ought to be made 
for debts of every description. The effect of it, in all its 
parts, you will, I am sure, be at no loss to trace ; and you will 
agree with me in opinion, that Congress can, by that means, 
obtain a degree of influence essential to the happiness of this 
country. Now, my dear Sir, I am most perfectly convinced, 
that, with the due exception of miracles, there is no probability 
that the States will ever make such grants, unless the army be 
united and determined in the pursuit of it ; and unless they be 
firmly supported, and as firmly support the other public creditors. That this may happen must be the entire wish of every 
intelligently just man, and of every real friend to our glorious 
revolution,

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The British employ themselves about the evacuation of New York, but that business goes on slowly. I am however 
informed from tolerable authority, that they will be gone by the 
beginning of November. If, as you suppose, the British Ministry imagine that we cannot retaliate their restrictions, they 
are deceived, for their conduct will itself give Congress a power, which they might not otherwise be possessed of. Indeed, 
my friend, nothing can do us so much good, as to convince the 
Eastern and Southern States how necessary it is to give proper force to the federal government, and nothing will so soon 
operate that conviction as foreign efforts to restrain the navigation of the one, and the commerce of the other. 
</p><p>
But for my own part, I have no desire to retaliate commercial restrictions. It is my fixed opinion, that a nation can by 
such restrictions do nothing more than injure herself, nor is an 
injury the less so because it affects mope the remote members, 
than it does the head of an empire. The sovereign may collect and ought to have revenue from all his dominions, which 
are in condition to afford it, but he acts weakly, as well as 
wickedly , if he cramps one part of the community, that he may 
draw more easily the blood and juices from another part. 
The late prohibition to trade with the British Islands, unless in 
British bottoms, can do us no harm, and can do them no 
good. Our produce they must and will have, and if they 
employ half a million in carrying on the navigation at a great 
expense, which we should have performed at a less expense 
for two hundred thousand, our two hundred thousand will be 
left for other operations, even to speculate on their produce 
and our own, so as to make them pay the speculator a profit on every gallon of rum they sell, and every barrel of flour they 
buy in our ports. By making the subsistence of their people 
in the Islands more expensive, they aid the efforts of rival nations to furnish the commodities of their Islands to others, and 
even to their own subjects. This kind of policy is so bad, that 
I am persuaded the British Ministers cannot seriously intend 
the prohibition, although I am equally convinced, that a regard 
to the national prejudices renders it unavoidable at present. 
I do not, therefore, think we should labor to undo what is 
done, but leave things a while to their own course. And as to 
a treaty of commerce, I think the best way is to make no 
treaty for some time to come, and if we tell them that we 
will make no treaty, they will be much more desirous of it than we ought to be. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met'>Mr Adams</a> seems to be in opinion with you, as to the necessity of sending a Minister to England, as indeed he does on 
some other points. He will, I suppose, be the man, for sundry 
reasons, which I might assign, but he will have serious cause 
to repent of the appointment under present circumstances. 
Nothing would have more unfavorable effects, than to send a 
Minister, who should feel himself attached or opposed to any of 
the parties, by which that nation is rent asunder. We should 
hold them in equal indifference of sentiment, with equal appearance of confidence, paying to the Ins a respect due to 
their places, but which neither Ins or Outs are, or can be, entitled to on the score of their merit and virtue, at least from us. 
As we may not easily find a man capable of this conduct, perhaps the best Minister is no Minister, for the want of one will 
show, that we are not precipitate in a desire of close connexion, and that, however the old mercantile habits may have revived commercial intercourse, the government has a proper 
jealousy and caution. This circumstance, also, must work favorably on our politics with other powers, and give weight 
and dignity lo the Ministers we do send. I am, &.c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Shortly after your departure from this place, I went to my 
farm, and returned hither last Sunday evening. Living out of 
the busy world, I had nothing to say worth your attention, or 
I should earlier have given you the trouble you must now experience. Although not very inquisitive about political opinion, I have not been quite attentive. The States eastward 
of New York appear to be almost unanimous in favor of the 
new Constitution, (for I make no account of the dissension in 
Rhode Island.) Their preachers are advocates for the adoption, and this circumstance, coinciding with the steady support 
of the property, and other abilities of the country, makes the 
current set strongly, and, I trust, irresistibly that way. 
</p><p>
Jersey is so near unanimity in her favorable opinion, that we may count with certainty on something more than votes, should 
the state of affairs hereafter require the application of pointed arguments. New York, hemmed in between the warm friends 
of the Constitution, will not easily, unless supported by powerful States, make any important struggle, even though her citizens were unanimous, which is by no means the case. Parties there are nearly balanced. If the assent, or dissent, ol 
the New York legislature were to decide OD the fate of America, there would still be a chance, though I believe the force; 
of government would preponderate, and effect a rejection. But the legislature cannot assign to the people any good reason, 
for not trusting them with a decision on their own affairs, and must therefore agree to a convention. In the choice of a 
convention, it is not improbable that the federal party will prove strongest, for persons of very distinct and opposite interests have joined on this subject. 
</p><p>
With respect to this State, I am far from being decided in my opinion, that they will consent. True it is, that the city 
and its neighborhood are enthusiastic in the cause, but I dread the cold and sour temper of the, back counties, and still more 
the wicked industry of those, who have long habituated themselves to live on the public, and cannot bear the idea of being removed from the power and profit of State government, which 
has been and still is the means of supporting themselves, their families, and dependants, and (which perhaps is equally 
grateful) of depressing and humbling their political adversaries. What opinions prevail more southward I cannot guess. 
You are in a better condition, than any other person, to judge of a great and important part of that country. 
</p><p>
I have observed, that your name to the new Constitution has been of infinite service. Indeed, I am convinced, that if 
you had not attended the Convention, and the same paper had 
been handed out to the world, it would have met with a colder reception, with fewer and weaker advocates, and with more 
and more strenuous opponents. As it is, should the idea prevail, that you will not accept of the Presidency, it would prove 
fatal in many parts. The truth is, that your great and decided superiority leads men willingly to put you in a place, 
which will not add to your personal dignity, nor raise you higher than you already stand. But they would not readily 
put any other person in the same situation, because they feel 
the elevation of others, as operating by comparison the degradation of themselves, and, however absurd this idea may be, 
yet you will agree with me, that men must be treated as men, 
and not as machines, much less as philosophers, and least of all 
things as reasonable creatures, seeing that in effect they reason 
not to direct, but to excuse, their conduct. 
</p><p>
Thus much for the public opinion on these subjects, which 
is not to be neglected in a country where opinion is everything. I am, &,c.

Dear General, 
</p><p>
After many unforeseen delays, I am about shortly to take 
my departure from Philadelphia for the kingdom of France, 
and I expect to visit both Holland and England. When I 
desire to be favored with your commands, it is not the mere 
ceremonious form of words, which you may every day meet 
from every man you meet, and which you know better than 
any man how to estimate at its true value. Whether I can be 
useful to you in any way, I know not ; but this I know, that 
you may command my best endeavors. And I now desist 
from farther profession on that subject, because I am sure you 
know my sincerity. 
</p><p>
You will oblige me by giving me letters of introduction to those persons, who may in your opinion be useful to me, and 
to whom you may think it proper to present me. Among others to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr Jefferson</a>, with whom I have only a slight acquaintance. I believe I once mentioned to you my wish, not to be 
encumbered with the letters introductory of the many, who are prone to give them. I think them a kind of paper money ; 
which is not only of little value, but which is not always a reputable, though a legal tender. I solicit yours, as an undoubted 
bill of exchange, which is gold wherever it goes. Permit me, however, to pursue the mercantile phrase, or metaphor, and 
honestly to request that you do not give me credit for more than I am worth, lest proving a bankrupt, you be called on by my creditors. 
</p><p>
I will pray your care of the enclosed to <a href='/results.php?tla=dah' rel='met'>Colonel Humphreys</a>, who, I doubt not, is still with you, and will, I expect, 
come on with you in the spring. I promised you some Chinese pigs, a promise which I can perform only by halves ; 
but such as I have I will send you; and, to piece and patch the matter as well as I may, in company with the pigs shall 
be sent a pair of Chinese geese, which are really the foolishest geese ever beheld, for they choose all times for sitting but the spring, and one of them is now actually engaged in that business. 
</p><p>
It would be degrading to the noble race of man, should I 
introduce politics after hogs and geese. This is a tolerable 
excuse for saying nothing, but the truth is I have nothing to 
say. I am of the breed of optimists, and believe that all will 
go well, for you will certainly be seated in the President's 
chair, and will, I am certain, when there greatly labor to prevent things from going ill. As to the rest, I heartily agree in 
the text, that " the wisdom of man is foolishness with God," 
having seen both fools and folly succeed in a most surprising 
manner. And the only key to such sort of success, that I 
ever met with, was in a sarcastic remark on three lawyers of 
New York; Smith given to the study of divinity, Alexander 
deep in mathematics, and C. deep in nothing. Smith, said the 
wag, is always in the clouds ; Alexander loses himself in 
angles and triangles ; the only sensible man at the bar is C. 
for he talks nonsense to a common jury. 
</p><p>
Present, I pray you, my sincere respects to Mrs Washington. It is my fervent wish, that neither she nor you may regret 
the shades of Mount Vernon. But this is more my wish, than expectation, for I do not believe it possible for you to be more 
happily placed, at least if I may judge from what I saw and what I felt. I am yours,

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I took the liberty in some late conversations to give you my sentiments on public affairs. I know the folly of offering opinions, which bear the appearance of advice, but a regard for 
you, and the sincerest wishes for the prosperity of this kingdom, pushed me beyond the line, which caution would have drawn for one of less ardent temper. I do not wish you to consider 
this as an apology. On the contrary, I desire you to recollect, both now and hereafter, the substance of those conversations. 
In that progress of events, which rapidly advances, you will judge my judgment. 
</p><p>
I am convinced, that the proposed Constitution cannot serve 
for the government of this country ; that the National Assembly, late the object of enthusiastic attachment, will soon be treated with disrespect; that the extreme licentiousness of your 
people will render it indispensable to increase the royal authority ; that under such circumstances the freedom and happiness of France must depend on the wisdom, integrity, and firmness of his Majesty's counsels, and, consequently, that the ablest 
and best men should be added to the present administration that, so far as regards yourself, you should take care that those, 
who come in, be sensible of the obligation they owe you, disposed to repay it, and of a temper neither to desert you, nor their sovereign, nor each other, in the moment of danger, or for 
the sake of advantage. I consider the present time as critical, and that if neglected many inseparable mischiefs must ensue. 
</p><p>
Such are the bodings of a mind, not easily ruffled nor alarmed, but feelingly alive to the interests of friendship, and devotedly attached to the liberties of mankind. Certainly you 
have much better means of information than I have. Certainly you have that intimate knowledge of your own nation, which 
it is impossible for a stranger to acquire. And most certainly 
you have perfect acquaintance with the characters, which stand 
forward for public observation. Let what I have said therefore go for nothing. I have repeated it here, as being in some 
sort the needful introduction to what I am now to communicate. 
</p><p>
Last evening, in company with some of your friends, who supposed me to enjoy a share of your confidence, in which I 
assured them, with great truth, that they were mistaken, I was urged to visit and entreat you not to go into the Council. 
Knowing how much you are occupied, and how improper it is for me to ; interfere I declined the visit, but was at length 
prevailed on by earnest entreaty to profuse, that I would in a letter assign the reasons, which influence them, and which are. 
first, that your present command must of necessity engrossed your time, and require undissipated attention, and in consequence that you must foil in the duty either of Minister or 
General. Secondly, that when in Council your opinions will 
not have more weight, and perhaps less-, than they have at present because at present they are respected as coming from you, 
but will only be received in Council according to the reasons adduced in their support, and it is not always that the wisest 
man is the most eloquent. Thirdly, if your opinions do not prevail, you will have the mortification to sanction by your 
presence the measures, which you disapprove, or quit in disgust the seat, which you have taken. Fourthly, if your opinions prevail, you will then in your quality of General be called 
on to execute what in your quality of councillor you have ordained. Tn this situation the public opinion will revolt' unless 
it : be subdued. The one will ruin -you, and the other your country, Fifthly, the jealousy and suspicion inseparable from 
tumultuous revolutions, and which have already been maliciously pointed against you, will certainly follow all your future 
steps, if you appear to be too strictly connected with the Court. The foundations of your authority will then crumble away, and 
you will fall the object of your own astonishment. Sixthly, the retreat of the Duke of Orleans is attributed to you, and if you 
go into the Council immediately after what is called by some his flight, and by others his banishment, the two events will be 
coupled in a manner particularly disadvantageous and disagreeable.- Seventhly, if you go into the Ministry with Mirabeau, or about the same time, every honest Frenchman will 
ask himself the cause of what he will call a very strange coalition. There are in this world men, who are to be employed ; 
not trusted. Virtue must ever be sullied by an alliance with 
vice. And liberty will blush at her introduction, if led by a hand polluted. Lastly, lam earnestly, most earnestly, requested by those who love you well, to add one caution as to your 
friends. Trust those who had that honor before the twelfth of July. New friends are zealous, they are ardent, they are attentive, but they are seldom true. 
</p><p>
Excuse the liberty of an old one, who is truly yours,

My Dear Madam, 
</p><p>
I need not tell you why the enclosed paper is transmitted to you. I know not the titles of the King of Prussia. These 
should be properly placed, you know, because monarchs are very sensitive on that subject. If reports say true, his majesty 
is more likely to listen to a woman than to a man, and this is favorable ; but what would be still more advantageous, would 
be to have your letter presented by the favorite of the day. I 
am told that Madame de Guiche has lately received his adorations. If you were to plead your cause in a court of justice, 
it might be well to insist on the rights of our unfortunate friend, but as the person to whom you address yourself is both judge 
and party, the matter of right must be touched with great gentleness. 
</p><p>
Be of good courage, for sooner or later the present clouds 
will be dissipated. All human things are liable to change. 
You may remember, that I used to inculcate that maxim when 
circumstances were smiling. It was then true, and it is still 
true. But then it was unpleasant, and now it will afford consolation. Farewell, my dear Madam. It will give me sincere 
pleasure to be useful to you and yours.

My Dear Friend, 
</p><p>
I have received yours of the third of February, and reply shortly, that I may reply immediately. My reason for which 
is, that I am told that the London Gazetteers have killed me, besides burning my house, and other little pleasantries of the 
same kind. Now as these accounts may be republished, I apprize you thereof, and pray you to vouch, that it was not 
true at the time of publication. 
</p><p>
You tell me that, in my place, you would resign and come home ; but this is not quite so easily done as said. In the 
first place, I must have leave to resign from the President ; but further, you will consider that the very circumstances, 
which you mention, are strong reasons for abiding, because it is not permitted to abandon a post in the hour of difficulty. 
T think the late decrees respecting our commerce will show you, that my continuance here has not been without some

Madam, 
</p><p>
If this letter ever reaches you, I shall be obliged for the 
favor to his Excellency, the Baron de Thugut, and I shall expect from his kindness to have your answer forwarded to me. 
The Marchioness de Montagu informed me, by a letter dated 
November twenty-seventh, that you had been forbidden to 
leave the prison, unless you would entirely abandon the intention of returning thither, and that, under this alternative, preferring the duty of a tender and faithful wife to the care of 
your own safety, you have given that decision, which those 
who knew the purity of your mind would naturally expect 
from you. Madame de Montagu adds, that you are not permitted to come here for the purpose of consulting a physician, 
although the state of your health imperiously requires it. 
</p><p>
It is certainly unnecessary for me, Madam, to express here 
the interest, which I take in your fate, and in that of your unfortunate friend, and to tell you how happy I should be, could 
I procure for him his liberty. Reasons, which I do not know, 
and which I nevertheless feel bound to respect, prevent this. 
But we are far from believing here, that his prison has any other 
disagreeable things about it, than those which are unavoidably 
connected with confinement. I am assured, on the contrary, that he is very well lodged, and in want of nothing ; that the 
vigilant exactness, with which he is guarded, arises only from the necessity of using all 'means to prevent his escape ; that, 
far from entertaining the barbarous idea of depriving you of the assistance of art, the physician of your choice will be sent to 
you ; and that, if you are forbidden to come to Vienna, and then return to Olmutz, it is because circumstances require, that 
the rules of an exact prudence should be followed. 
</p><p>
You must not despair, Madam; time will give liberty to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a> ; but, in the mean time, if he has been 
ill treated, as Madame de Montagu lias been induced to believe, it is important that it may be known, in order that means 
may be taken to prevent it ; and in case he experiences, in accordance with the benevolent intentions of his Majesty, gentle 
and humane treatment, it seems to me equally proper to ascertain it, in order to put a stop to odious reports, which cannot but exasperate, and which consequently might postpone 
the moment of his liberation. To this effect, have the goodness, Madam, I entreat you, to send me your answer open, 
under cover to his Excellency, the Baron de Thugut. I am 
still uncertain whether I shall be able to receive it at Vienna, 
as it is my intention to depart in a few days. But I flatter 
myself, that we shall meet again in America ; and I pray you 
to believe, that I shall always and everywhere preserve the sincere attachment, with which I have the honor to be, &c.

TO THE BARON DE THUGUT. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=vienna' rel='city origin'>Vienna</a>, <a rel="month origin" value="12">December</a> <a rel='day origin' value='31'>31st</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1796' rel="origin">1796</a>.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to send you herewith a letter for Madame de Lafayette, requesting you in the first place to pardon me 
this liberty, then to examine the letter, and finally to have the goodness to transmit it to her. Your good sense will easily 
perceive the reasons, which have induced me to write to her, 
and will know how to appreciate them. It would, however, be a most praiseworthy action on your part to suppress the 
letter, and to send me, in place of any answer to it, an order for the release of the unfortunate individual in question. In 
that case, I promise you not only the good news, which is expected from the Rhine, but also that which perhaps is not expected from Italy ; which, like the favor I venture to solicit, will not be the less agreeable, for having been unexpected. 
You will probably smile at my absurd pretensions to the character of a prophet ; but only promise me, that the passports of 
Lafayette shall be prepared three days after you shall have heard of the defeat of Bonaparte, and we shall then see what will happen. 
</p><p>
But for the rest, whatever may happen, I return to my first subject, and take the liberty of observing to you once more, 
that the sooner he is liberated the better, if, as I suppose, that is finally to be done. And since no one has had any right to 
know why his Majesty, the Emperor, determined to detain him as a prisoner, so no one can assume that of demanding why 
his kindness has set him at liberty. The maxim, stat pro ratione voluntcts, may be applied to acts of mercy, as well as to 
those of authority ; and, generally, if not with the same splendor, at least with the same dignity. Think, also, that forgiveness granted to others is the only unobjectionable title, of which we can avail ourselves before the King of kings. And 
may we be at last permitted to hope that the year, which will soon commence, may be crowned in its cradle by the hand of 
clemency, and in its course by that of glory. I have the honor to be, &c.
